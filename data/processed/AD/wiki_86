{"id": "42142", "revid": "4796325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42142", "title": "Historical fiction", "text": "Genre of fiction that is set in the past\nHistorical fiction is a literary genre in which a fictional plot takes place in the setting of particular real historical events. Although the term is commonly used as a synonym for historical fiction literature, it can also be applied to other types of narrative, including theatre, opera, cinema, and television, as well as video games and graphic novels.\nAn essential element of historical fiction is that it is set in the past and pays attention to the manners, social conditions and other details of the depicted period. Authors also frequently choose to explore notable historical figures in these settings, allowing readers to better understand how these individuals might have responded to their environments. The historical romance usually seeks to romanticize eras of the past. Some subgenres such as alternate history and historical fantasy insert intentionally ahistorical or speculative elements into a novel.\nWorks of historical fiction are sometimes criticized for lack of authenticity because of readerly criticism or genre expectations for accurate period details. This tension between historical authenticity and fiction frequently becomes a point of comment for readers and popular critics, while scholarly criticism frequently goes beyond this commentary, investigating the genre for its other thematic and critical interests.\nHistorical fiction as a contemporary Western literary genre has its foundations in the early-19th-century works of Sir Walter Scott and his contemporaries in other national literatures such as the Frenchman Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, the American James Fenimore Cooper, and later the Russian Leo Tolstoy. However, the melding of historical and fictional elements in individual works of literature has a long tradition in many cultures; both Western traditions (as early as Ancient Greek and Latin literature) as well as Eastern, in the form of oral and folk traditions (see mythology and folklore), which produced epics, novels, plays, and other fictional works describing history for contemporary audiences.\nIntroduction.\nDefinitions differ as to what constitutes a historical novel. On the one hand the Historical Novel Society defines the genre as works \"written at least fifty years after the events described\", while the critic Sarah Johnson delineates such novels as \"set before the middle of the last [20th] century ... in which the author is writing from research rather than personal experience.\" Then again Lynda Adamson, in her preface to the bibliographic reference work \"World Historical Fiction\", states that while a \"generally accepted definition\" for the historical novel is a novel \"about a time period at least 25 years before it was written\", some people read novels written in the past, like those of Jane Austen (1775\u20131817), as if they were historical novels.\nHistorical fiction sometimes encouraged movements of romantic nationalism. Walter Scott's Waverley novels created interest in Scottish history and still illuminate it. A series of novels by J\u00f3zef Ignacy Kraszewski on the history of Poland popularized the country's history after it had lost its independence in the Partitions of Poland. Henryk Sienkiewicz wrote several immensely popular novels set in conflicts between the Poles and predatory Teutonic Knights, rebelling Cossacks and invading Swedes. He won the 1905 Nobel Prize in literature. He also wrote the popular novel \"Quo Vadis\", which was about Nero's Rome and the early Christians and has been adapted several times for film, in 1913, 1924, 1951, 2001 to only name the most prominent. Sigrid Undset's \"Kristin Lavransdatter\" fulfilled a similar function for Norwegian history; Undset later won a Nobel Prize for Literature (1928).\nMany early historical novels played an important role in the rise of European popular interest in the history of the Middle Ages. Victor Hugo's \"The Hunchback of Notre-Dame\" often receives credit for fueling the movement to preserve the Gothic architecture of France, leading to the establishment of the \"Monuments historiques\", the French governmental authority for historic preservation.\nThe genre of the historical novel has also permitted some authors, such as the Polish novelist Boles\u0142aw Prus in his sole historical novel, \"Pharaoh\", to distance themselves from their own time and place to gain perspective on society and on the human condition, or to escape the depredations of the censor.\nIn some historical novels, major historic events take place mostly off-stage, while the fictional characters inhabit the world where those events occur. Robert Louis Stevenson's \"Kidnapped\" recounts mostly private adventures set against the backdrop of the Jacobite troubles in Scotland. Charles Dickens's \"Barnaby Rudge\" is set amid the Gordon Riots, and \"A Tale of Two Cities\" in the French Revolution.\nIn some works, the accuracy of the historical elements has been questioned, as in Alexandre Dumas' 1845 novel \"Queen Margot\". Postmodern novelists such as John Barth and Thomas Pynchon operate with even more freedom, mixing historical characters and settings with invented history and fantasy, as in the novels \"The Sot-Weed Factor\" (1960) and \"Mason &amp; Dixon\" (1997) respectively. A few writers create historical fiction without fictional characters. One example is the series \"Masters of Rome\" by Colleen McCullough.\nHistory.\nHistory up to 17th century.\nHistorical prose fiction has a long tradition in world literature. Three of the Four Classics of Chinese novels were set in the distant past: Shi Nai'an's 14th-century \"Water Margin\" concerns 12th-century outlaws; Luo Guanzhong's 14th-century \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\" concerns 3rd-century wars which ended the Han dynasty; Wu Cheng'en's 16th-century \"Journey to the West\" concerns the 7th-century Buddhist pilgrim Xuanzang. In addition to those, there was a wealth of historical novels that became popular in the literary circles during the Ming and Qing periods in Chinese history; they include Feng Menglong's \"Dongzhou Lieguo Zhi\" (\"Chronicles of the Eastern Zhou Kingdoms\"), 's \"Sanbao taijian xiyang ji\", Sun Gaoliang's \"Yu Shaobao cui zhong quanzhuan\", 's ' (\"Romance of the Sui and Tang dynasties\"), 's ' (\"Records of the Two Songs, South and North\") and ', 's ' (\"Romance of the Eastern and Western Jin dynasties\"), the anonymous \"\", and Qian Cai's \"The General Yue Fei\", etc.\nClassical Greek novelists were also \"very fond of writing novels about people and places of the past\". \"The Iliad\" has been described as historic fiction, since it treats historic events, although its genre is generally considered epic poetry. Pierre Vidal-Naquet has suggested that Plato laid the foundations for the historical novel through the myth of Atlantis contained in his dialogues \"Timaeus\" and \"Critias\". \"The Tale of Genji\" (written before 1021) is a fictionalized account of Japanese court life about a century prior and its author asserted that her work could present a \"fuller and therefore 'truer'\" version of history.\nOne of the early examples of the historical novel in Europe is \"La Princesse de Cl\u00e8ves\", a French novel published anonymously in March 1678. It is regarded by many as the beginning of the modern tradition of the psychological novel and as a great work. Its author generally is held to be Madame de La Fayette. The action takes place between October 1558 and November 1559 at the royal court of Henry II of France. The novel recreates that era with remarkable precision. Nearly every character \u2013 except the heroine \u2013 is a historical figure. Events and intrigues unfold with great faithfulness to documentary records. In the United Kingdom, the historical novel \"appears to have developed\" from \"La Princesse de Cl\u00e8ves\", \"and then via the Gothic novel\". Another early example is \"The Unfortunate Traveller\" by Thomas Nashe, published in 1594 and set during the reign of King Henry VIII.\n19th century.\nHistorical fiction rose to prominence in Europe during the early 19th century as part of the Romantic reaction to the Enlightenment, especially through the influence of the Scottish writer Sir Walter Scott, whose works were immensely popular throughout Europe. Among his early European followers we can find Willibald Alexis, Theodor Fontane, Bernhard Severin Ingemann, Mikl\u00f3s J\u00f3sika, M\u00f3r J\u00f3kai, Jakob van Lennep, Carl Jonas Love Almqvist, Victor Rydberg, Andreas Munch, Alessandro Manzoni, Alfred de Vigny, Honor\u00e9 de Balzac or Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e. Jane Porter's 1803 novel \"Thaddeus of Warsaw\" is one of the earliest examples of the historical novel in English and went through at least 84 editions, including translation into French and German. The first true historical novel in English was in fact Maria Edgeworth's \"Castle Rackrent\" (1800).\nIn the 20th century Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs argued that Scott was the first fiction writer who saw history not just as a convenient frame in which to stage a contemporary narrative, but rather as a distinct social and cultural setting. Scott's Scottish novels such as \"Waverley\" (1814) and \"Rob Roy\" (1817) focused upon a middling character who sits at the intersection of various social groups in order to explore the development of society through conflict. \"Ivanhoe\" (1820) gained credit for renewing interest in the Middle Ages.\nMany well-known writers from the United Kingdom published historical novels in the mid 19th century, the most notable include Thackeray's \"Vanity Fair\", Charles Dickens's \"A Tale of Two Cities\", George Eliot's \"Romola\", and Charles Kingsley's \"Westward Ho!\" and \"Hereward the Wake\". \"The Trumpet-Major\" (1880) is Thomas Hardy's only historical novel, and is set in Weymouth during the Napoleonic Wars, when the town was then anxious about the possibility of invasion by Napoleon.\nIn the United States, the first historical novelist was Samuel Woodworth, who wrote \"The Champions of American Freedom\" in 1816. James Fenimore Cooper was better known for his historical novels and was influenced by Scott. His most famous novel is \"\" (1826), the second book of the \"Leatherstocking Tales\" pentalogy. \"The Last of the Mohicans\" is set in 1757, during the French and Indian War (the Seven Years' War), when France and Great Britain battled for control of North America. Cooper's chief rival, John Neal, wrote \"Rachel Dyer\" (1828), the first bound novel about the 17th-century Salem witch trials. \"Rachel Dyer\" also influenced future American fiction set in this period, like \"The Scarlet Letter\" (1850) by Nathaniel Hawthorne which is one of the most famous 19th-century American historical novels. Set in 17th-century Puritan Boston, Massachusetts during the years 1642 to 1649, it tells the story of Hester Prynne, who conceives a daughter through an affair and struggles to create a new life of repentance and dignity.\nIn French literature, the most prominent inheritor of Scott's style of the historical novel was Balzac. In 1829 Balzac published \"Les Chouans\", a historical work in the manner of Sir Walter Scott. This was subsequently incorporated into \"La Com\u00e9die Humaine\". The bulk of \"La Com\u00e9die Humaine\", however, takes place during the Bourbon Restoration and the July Monarchy, though there are several novels which take place during the French Revolution and others which take place of in the Middle Ages or the Renaissance, including \"About Catherine de Medici\" and \"The Elixir of Long Life\".\nVictor Hugo's \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" (1831) furnishes another 19th-century example of the romantic-historical novel. Victor Hugo began writing \"The Hunchback of Notre-Dame\" in 1829, largely to make his contemporaries more aware of the value of the Gothic architecture, which was neglected and often destroyed to be replaced by new buildings, or defaced by replacement of parts of buildings in a newer style. The action takes place in 1482 and the title refers to the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, on which the story is centered. Alexandre Dumas also wrote several popular historical fiction novels, including \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" and \"The Three Musketeers\". George Saintsbury stated: \"\"Monte Cristo\" is said to have been at its first appearance, and for some time subsequently, the most popular book in Europe.\" This popularity has extended into modern times as well. The book was \"translated into virtually all modern languages and has never been out of print in most of them. There have been at least twenty-nine motion pictures based on it\u00a0... as well as several television series, and many movies [have] worked the name 'Monte Cristo' into their titles.\"\nTolstoy's \"War and Peace\" offers an example of 19th-century historical fiction used to critique contemporary history. Tolstoy read the standard histories available in Russian and French about the Napoleonic Wars, and used the novel to challenge those historical approaches. At the start of the novel's third volume, he describes his work as blurring the line between fiction and history, in order to get closer to the truth. The novel is set 60 years before it was composed, and alongside researching the war through primary and secondary sources, he spoke with people who had lived through war during the French invasion of Russia in 1812; thus, the book is also, in part, ethnography fictionalized.\n\"The Charterhouse of Parma\" by Marie-Henri Beyle (Stendhal) is an epic retelling of the story of an Italian nobleman who lives through the Napoleonic period in Italian history. It includes a description of the Battle of Waterloo by the principal character. Stendhal fought with Napoleon and participated in the French invasion of Russia.\n\"The Betrothed\" (1827) by Alessandro Manzoni has been called the most famous and widely read novel of the Italian language. \"The Betrothed\" was inspired by Walter Scott's \"Ivanhoe\" but, compared to its model, shows some innovations (two members of the lower class as principal characters, the past described without romantic idealization, an explicitly Christian message), somehow forerunning the realistic novel of the following decades. Set in northern Italy in 1628, during the oppressive years under Spanish rule, it is sometimes seen as a veiled attack on Austria, which controlled the region at the time the novel was written.\nThe critical and popular success of \"The Betrothed\" gave rise to a crowd of imitations and, in the age of unification, almost every Italian writer tried his hand at the genre; novels now almost forgotten, like \"Marco Visconti\" by Tommaso Grossi (Manzoni's best friend) or \"Ettore Fieramosca\" by Massimo D'Azeglio (Manzoni's son-in-law), were the best-sellers of their time. Many of these authors, such as Niccol\u00f2 Tommaseo, Francesco Domenico Guerrazzi and D'Azeglio himself, were patriots and politicians too, and in their novels, the veiled politic message of Manzoni became explicit (the hero of \"Ettore Fieramosca\" fights to defend the honor of the Italian soldiers, mocked by some arrogant Frenchmen). In them, the narrative talent not equaled the patriotic passion, and their novels, full of rhetoric and melodramatic excesses, are today barely readable as historical documents. A significant exception is \"The Confessions of an Italian\" by Ippolito Nievo, an epic about the Venetian republic's fall and the Napoleonic age, told with satiric irony and youthful brio (Nievo wrote it when he was 26 years old).\nIn Arabic literature, the Lebanese writer Jurji Zaydan (1861\u20131914) was the most prolific novelist of this genre. He wrote 23 historical novels between 1889 and 1914. His novels played an important in shaping the collective consciousness of modern Arabs during the Nahda period and educated them about their history. \"The Fleeing Mamluk\" (1891), \"The Captive of the Mahdi Pretender\" (1892), and \"Virgin of Quraish\" (1899) are some of his nineteenth-century historical novels.\n20th century.\nGermany.\nA major 20th-century example of this genre is the German author Thomas Mann's \"Buddenbrooks\" (1901). This chronicles the decline of a wealthy north German merchant family over the course of four generations, incidentally portraying the manner of life and mores of the Hanseatic bourgeoisie in the years from 1835 to 1877. Mann drew deeply from the history of his own family, the Mann family of L\u00fcbeck, and their milieu. This was Mann's first novel, and with the publication of the 2nd edition in 1903, \"Buddenbrooks\" became a major literary success. The work led to a Nobel Prize in Literature for Mann in 1929; although the Nobel award generally recognizes an author's body of work, the Swedish Academy's citation for Mann identified \"his great novel \"Buddenbrooks\"\" as the principal reason for his prize. Mann also wrote, between 1926 and 1943, a four-part novel \"Joseph and His Brothers\". In it Mann retells the familiar biblical stories of Genesis, from Jacob to Joseph (chapters 27\u201350), setting it in the historical context of the reign of Akhenaten (1353\u20131336 BC) in ancient Egypt.\nIn the same era, Lion Feuchtwanger was one of the most popular and accomplished writers of historical novels, with publications between the 1920s and 1950s. His reputation began with the bestselling work, \"Jud S\u00fc\u00df\" (1925), set in the eighteenth century, as well as historical novels written primarily in exile in France and California, including most prominently the \"Josephus trilogy\" set in Ancient Rome (1932 / 1935 / 1942), \"Goya\" (1951), and his novel \"Raquel: The Jewess of Toledo\" - set in Medieval Spain.\nBritain.\nRobert Graves of Britain wrote several popular historical novels, including \"I, Claudius\", \"King Jesus\", \"The Golden Fleece\" and \"Count Belisarius\". John Cowper Powys wrote two historical novels set in Wales, \"Owen Glendower\" (1941) and \"Porius\" (1951). The first deals with the rebellion of the Welsh Prince Owain Glynd\u0175r (AD 1400\u201316), while \"Porius\" takes place during the Dark Ages, in AD 499, just before the Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain. Powys suggests parallels with these historical periods and Britain in the late 1930s and during World War II.\nOther significant British novelists include Georgette Heyer, Naomi Mitchison and Mary Renault. Heyer essentially established the historical romance genre and its subgenre Regency romance, which was inspired by Jane Austen. To ensure accuracy, Heyer collected reference works and kept detailed notes on all aspects of Regency life. While some critics thought the novels were too detailed, others considered the level of detail to be Heyer's greatest asset; Heyer even recreated William the Conqueror's crossing into England for her novel \"The Conqueror\". Naomi Mitchison's finest novel, \"The Corn King and the Spring Queen\" (1931), is regarded by some as the best historical novel of the 20th century. Mary Renault is best known for her historical novels set in Ancient Greece. In addition to fictional portrayals of Theseus, Socrates, Plato, Simonides of Ceos and Alexander the Great, she wrote a non-fiction biography of Alexander. \"The Siege of Krishnapur\" (1973) by J. G. Farrell has been described as an \"outstanding novel\". Inspired by events such as the sieges of Cawnpore and Lucknow, the book details the siege of a fictional Indian town, Krishnapur, during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 from the perspective of the town's British residents. The main characters find themselves subject to the increasing strictures and deprivation of the siege, and the absurdity of maintaining the British class system in a town no one can leave becomes a source of comic invention, though the text is serious in intent and tone.\nIn Welsh literature, the major contributor to the genre in Welsh is William Owen Roberts (b. 1960). His historical novels include \"Y Pla\" (1987), set at the time of the Black Death; \"Paradwys\" (2001), 18th century, concerning the slave trade; and \"Petrograd\" (2008) and \"Paris\" (2013), concerning the Russian revolution and its aftermath. \"Y Pla\" has been much translated, appearing in English as \"Pestilence\", and \"Petrograd\" and \"Paris\" have also appeared in English. A contemporary of Roberts' working in English is Christopher Meredith (b. 1954), whose \"Griffri\" (1991) is set in the 12th century and has the poet of a minor Welsh prince as narrator.\nNobel Prize laureate William Golding wrote a number of historical novels. \"The Inheritors\" (1955) is set in prehistoric times, and shows \"new people\" (generally identified with \"Homo sapiens sapiens\") triumphing over a gentler race (generally identified with Neanderthals) by deceit and violence. \"The Spire\" (1964) follows the building (and near collapse) of a huge spire onto a medieval cathedral (generally assumed to be Salisbury Cathedral); the spire symbolizing both spiritual aspiration and worldly vanity. \"The Scorpion God\" (1971) consists of three novellas, the first set in a prehistoric African hunter-gatherer band (\"Clonk, Clonk\"), the second in an ancient Egyptian court (\"The Scorpion God\") and the third in the court of a Roman emperor (\"Envoy Extraordinary\"). The trilogy \"To the Ends of the Earth\", which includes the \"Rites of Passage\" (1980), \"Close Quarters\" (1987), and \"Fire Down Below\" (1989), describes sea voyages in the early 19th century. Anthony Burgess also wrote several historical novels; his last novel, \"A Dead Man in Deptford\", is about the murder of Christopher Marlowe in the 16th century.\nThough the genre has evolved since its inception, the historical novel remains popular with authors and readers to this day and bestsellers include Patrick O'Brian's \"Aubrey\u2013Maturin series\", Ken Follett's \"Pillars of the Earth\" and Dorothy Dunnett's \"Lymond Chronicles\". A development in British and Irish writing in the past 25 years has been a renewed interest in the First World War. Works include William Boyd's \"An Ice-Cream War\"; Sebastian Faulks' \"Birdsong\" and \"The Girl at the Lion d'Or\" (concerned with the War's consequences); Pat Barker's \"Regeneration Trilogy\" and Sebastian Barry's \"A Long Long Way\".\nUnited States.\nAmerican Nobel laureate William Faulkner's novel \"Absalom, Absalom!\" (1936) is set before, during and after the American Civil War. Kenneth Roberts wrote several books set around the events of the American Revolution, of which \"Northwest Passage\" (1937), \"Oliver Wiswell\" (1940) and \"Lydia Bailey\" (1947) all became best-sellers in the 1930s and 1940s. The following American authors have also written historical novels in the 20th century: Gore Vidal, John Barth, Norman Mailer, E. L. Doctorow and William Kennedy. Thomas Pynchon's historical novel \"Mason &amp; Dixon\" (1997) tells the story of the two English surveyors, Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, who were charged with marking the boundary between Pennsylvania and Maryland in the 18th century. More recently there have been works such as Neal Stephenson's \"Baroque Cycle\", and Grant Maierhofer's \"https://\", which imagines the life of Anatoli Bugorski, around the incident wherein he unwittingly stuck his head inside of a particle accelerator in 1978.\nItaly.\nIn Italy, the tradition of historical fiction has flourished in the modern age, the nineteenth century in particular having caught writers' interests. Southern Italian novelists like Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa (The Leopard), Francesco Iovine (\"Lady Ava\"), Carlo Alianello (\"The Heritage of the Prioress\") and more recently Andrea Camilleri (\"The Preston Brewer\") retold the events of the Italian Unification, at times overturning its traditionally heroic and progressive image. The conservative Riccardo Bacchelli in \"The Devil at the Long Point\" and the communist Vasco Pratolini in \"Metello\" described, from ideologically opposite points of view, the birth of Italian Socialism. Bacchelli also wrote \"The Mill on the Po\", a patchwork saga of a family of millers from the time of Napoleon to the First World War, one of the most epic novels of the last century.\nIn 1980, Umberto Eco achieved international success with \"The Name of the Rose\", a novel set in an Italian abbey in 1327 readable as a historical mystery, as an allegory of Italy during the Years of Lead, and as an erudite joke. Eco's work, like Manzoni's preceding it, relaunched Italian interest in historical fiction. Many novelists who till then had preferred the contemporary novel tried their hand at stories set in previous centuries. Among them were Fulvio Tomizza (\"The Evil Coming from North\", about the Reformation), Dacia Maraini (\"The Silent Duchess\", about the female condition in the eighteenth century), Sebastiano Vassalli (\"The Chimera\", about a witch hunt), Ernesto Ferrero (\"N\") and Valerio Manfredi (\"The Last Legion\").\nBulgaria.\nFani Popova\u2013Mutafova (1902\u20131977) was a Bulgarian author who is considered by many to have been the best-selling Bulgarian historical fiction author ever. Her books sold in record numbers in the 1930s and the early 1940s. However, she was eventually sentenced to seven years of imprisonment by the Bulgarian communist regime because of some of her writings celebrating Hitler, and though released after only eleven months for health reasons, was forbidden to publish anything between 1943 and 1972. Stoyan Zagorchinov (1889\u20131969) also a Bulgarian writer, author of \"Last Day, God's Day\" trilogy and \"Ivaylo\", continuing the tradition in the Bulgarian historical novel, led by Ivan Vazov. Yana Yazova (1912\u20131974) also has several novels that can be considered historical as \"\"Alexander of Macedon\", her only novel on non-Bulgarian thematic, as well as her trilogy \"Balkani\"\". Vera Mutafchieva (1929\u20132009) is the author of historical novels which were translated into 11 languages. Anton Donchev (1930\u2013) is an old living author, whose first independent novel, \"Samuel's Testimony\", was published in 1961. His second book, \"Time of Parting\", which dealt with the Islamization of the population in the Rhodopes during the XVII century was written in 1964. The novel was adapted in the serial movie \"Time of Violence\", divided into two parts with the subtitles (\"The Threat\" and \"The Violence\") by 1987 by the director Lyudmil Staykov. In June 2015, \"Time of Violence\" was chosen as the most beloved film of Bulgarian viewers in \"Laced Shoes of Bulgarian Cinema\", a large-scale consultation with the audience of Bulgarian National Television.\nScandinavia.\nOne of the best known Scandinavian historical novels is Sigrid Undset's \"Kristin Lavransdatter\" (1920\u20131922) set in medieval Norway. For this trilogy Undset was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1928. Johannes V. Jensen's trilogy \"Kongens fald\" (1900\u20131901, \"The Fall of the King\"), set in 16th century Denmark, has been called \"the finest historical novel in Danish literature\". The epic historical novel series \"Den lange rejse\" (1908\u20131921, \"The Long Journey\") is generally regarded as Jensen's masterpiece and he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1944 partly on the strength of it. The Finnish writer Mika Waltari is known for the historical novel \"The Egyptian\" (1945). Faroes\u2013Danish writer William Heinesen wrote several historical novels, most notably \"Det gode h\u00e5b\" (1964, \"Fair Hope\") set in the Faroe Islands in 17th century.\nHistorical fiction has long been a popular genre in Sweden, especially since the 1960s a huge number of historical novels has been written. Nobel laureates Eyvind Johnson and P\u00e4r Lagerkvist wrote acclaimed historical novels such as \"Return to Ithaca\" (1946) and \"Barabbas\" (1950). Vilhelm Moberg's \"Ride This Night\" (1941) is set in 16th century Sm\u00e5land and his widely read novel series \"The Emigrants\" tells the story of Sm\u00e5land emigrants to the United States in the 19th century. Per Anders Fogelstr\u00f6m wrote a hugely popular series of five historical novels set in his native Stockholm beginning with \"City of My Dreams\" (1960). Other writers of historical fiction in Swedish literature include Sara Lidman, Birgitta Trotzig, Per Olov Enquist and Artur Lundkvist.\nLatin America.\nThe historical novel was quite popular in 20th century Latin American literature, including works such as \"The Kingdom of This World\" (1949) by Alejo Carpentier, \"I, the Supreme\" (1974) by Augusto Roa Bastos, \"Terra Nostra\" (1975) by Carlos Fuentes, \"News from the Empire\" (1987) by Fernando del Paso, \"The Lightning of August\" (1964) by Jorge Ibarg\u00fcengoitia, \"The War of the End of the World\" (1981) by Mario Vargas Llosa and \"The Autumn of the Patriarch\" (1975) by Gabriel Garc\u00eda Marquez. Other writers of historical fiction include Abel Posse, Antonio Benitez Rojo, Jo\u00e3o Ubaldo Ribeiro, Jorge Amado, Homero Aridjis.\n21st century.\nIn the first decades of the 21st century, an increased interest for historical fiction has been noted. One of the most successful writers of historical novels is Hilary Mantel. Other writers of historical fiction include Philippa Gregory, Bernard Cornwell, Sarah Waters, Ken Follett, George Saunders, Shirley Hazzard and Julie Orringer. The historical novel \"The Books of Jacob\" set in 18th century Poland has been praised as the magnum opus by the 2018 Nobel Prize in Literature laureate Olga Tokarczuk.\nSubgenres.\nDocumentary fiction.\nA 20th-century variant of the historical novel is documentary fiction, which incorporates \"not only historical characters and events, but also reports of everyday events\" found in contemporary newspapers. Examples of this variant form of historical novel include \"U.S.A.\" (1938), and \"Ragtime\" (1975) by E.L. Doctorow.\nFictional biographies.\n\"Memoirs of Hadrian\" by the Belgian-born French writer Marguerite Yourcenar is about the life and death of Roman Emperor Hadrian. First published in France in French in 1951 as \"M\u00e9moires d'Hadrien\", the book was an immediate success, meeting with enormous critical acclaim. Margaret George has written fictional biographies about historical persons in \"The Memoirs of Cleopatra\" (1997) and \"Mary, called Magdalene\" (2002). Earlier examples are \"Peter I\" (1929\u201334) by Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy, and \"I, Claudius\" (1934) and \"King Jesus\" (1946) by Robert Graves. Other recent biographical novel series include \"Conqueror\" and \"Emperor\" by Conn Iggulden and \"Cicero Trilogy\" by Robert Harris.\nGothic fiction.\nThe gothic novel was popular in the late eighteenth century. Set in the historical past it has an interest in the mysterious, terrifying and haunting. Horace Walpole's 1764 novel \"The Castle of Otranto\" is considered to be an influential work.\nHistorical romance and family sagas.\nRomantic themes have also been portrayed, such as \"Doctor Zhivago\" by Boris Pasternak and \"Gone with the Wind\" by Margaret Mitchell. One of the first popular historical romances appeared in 1921, when Georgette Heyer published \"The Black Moth\", which is set in 1751. It was not until 1935 that she wrote the first of her signature Regency novels, set around the English Regency period (1811\u20131820), when the Prince Regent ruled England in place of his ill father, George III. Heyer's Regency novels were inspired by Jane Austen's novels of the late 18th and early 19th century. Because Heyer's writing was set in the midst of events that had occurred over 100 years previously, she included authentic period detail in order for her readers to understand. Where Heyer referred to historical events, it was as background detail to set the period, and did not usually play a key role in the narrative. Heyer's characters often contained more modern-day sensibilities, and more conventional characters in the novels would point out the heroine's eccentricities, such as wanting to marry for love.\nNautical and pirate fiction.\nSome historical novels explore life at sea, including C. S. Forester's Hornblower series, Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey\u2013Maturin series, Alexander Kent's The Bolitho novels, Dudley Pope's Lord Ramage's series, all of which all deal with the Napoleonic Wars. There are also adventure novels with pirate characters like Robert Louis Stevenson's \"Treasure Island\" (1883), Emilio Salgari's Sandokan (1895\u20131913) and \"Captain Blood\" (1922) by Rafael Sabatini. Recent examples of historical novels about pirates are \"The Adventures of Hector Lynch\" by Tim Severin, \"The White Devil (\u0411\u0435\u043b\u0438\u044f\u0442 \u0414\u044f\u0432\u043e\u043b)\" by Hristo Kalchev and \"The Pirate Devlin\" novels by Mark Keating.\nHistoriographic metafiction.\nHistoriographic metafiction combines historical fiction with metafiction. The term is closely associated with postmodern literature including writers such as Salman Rushdie and Thomas Pynchon.\nSeveral novels by Nobel Prize laureate Jos\u00e9 Saramago are set in historical times including \"Baltasar and Blimunda\", \"The Gospel According to Jesus Christ\" and \"The History of the Siege of Lisbon\". In a parallel plot set in the 12th and 20th century where history and fiction are constantly overlapping, the latter novel questions the reliability of historical sources and deals with the difference of writing history and fiction.\nChildren's historical fiction.\nA prominent subgenre within historical fiction is the children's historical novel. Often following a pedagogical bent, children's historical fiction may follow the conventions of many of the other subgenres of historical fiction. A number of such works include elements of historical fantasy or time travel to facilitate the transition between the contemporary world and the past in the tradition of children's portal fiction. Sometimes publishers will commission series of historical novels that explore different periods and times. Among the most popular contemporary series include the American Girl novels and the Magic Tree House series. A prominent award within children's historical fiction is the Scott O'Dell Award for Historical Fiction.\nComics and graphic novels.\nHistorical narratives have also found their way in comics and graphic novels. There are Prehistorical elements in jungle comics like Akim and Rahan. Ancient Greece inspired graphic novels are \"300\" created by Frank Miller, centered around Battle of Thermopylae, and \"Age of Bronze series\" by Eric Shanower, that retells Trojan War. Historical subjects can also be found in manhua comics like \"Three Kingdoms\" and \"Sun Zi's Tactics\" by Lee Chi Ching, \"Weapons of the Gods\" by Wong Yuk Long as well as \"The Ravages of Time\" by Chan Mou. There are also straight series like \"Path of the Assassin\", \"Vagabond\", \"Rurouni Kenshin\" and \"Azumi\". Several comics and graphic novels have been produced into anime series or a movie adaptations like \"Azumi\" and \"300\".\nThe performing arts.\nPeriod drama films and television series.\nHistorical drama film stories are based upon historical events and famous people. Some historical dramas are docudramas, which attempt an accurate portrayal of a historical event or biography, to the degree that the available historical research will allow. Other historical dramas are fictionalized tales that are based on an actual person and their deeds, such as \"Braveheart\", which is loosely based on the 13th-century knight William Wallace's fight for Scotland's independence. For films pertaining to the history of East Asia, Central Asia, and South Asia, there are historical drama films set in Asia, also known as Jidaigeki in Japan. like \"The Hidden Power of the Dragon Sabre\" (1984) and \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" (2000), based on novels by Jin Yong and Wang Dulu, have also been produced. Zhang Yimou has directed several acclaimed wuxia films like \"Hero\" (2002), \"House of Flying Daggers\" (2004) and \"Curse of the Golden Flower\" (2006). Although largely fictional some wuxia films are considered historical drama. Samurai films like Zatoichi and Lone Wolf and Cub series also fall under historical drama umbrella. Peplum films also known as sword-and-sandal, is a genre of largely Italian-made historical or biblical epics (costume dramas) that dominated the Italian film industry from 1958 to 1965. Most pepla featured a superhumanly strong man as the protagonist, such as Hercules, Samson, Goliath, Ursus or Italy's own popular folk hero Maciste. These supermen often rescued captive princesses from tyrannical despots and fought mythological creatures. Not all the films were fantasy-based, however. Many featured actual historical personalities such as Julius Caesar, Cleopatra, and Hannibal, although great liberties were taken with the storylines. Gladiators, pirates, knights, Vikings, and slaves rebelling against tyrannical kings were also popular subjects. There are also films based on Medieval narratives like Ridley Scott's historical epics \"Robin Hood\" (2010) and \"Kingdom of Heaven\" (2005) and the subgenred films based on the Arthurian legend such as \"\" (2008) and \"King Arthur\" (2004).\nMany historical narratives have been expanded into television series. Notable ancient history inspired TV series include: \"Rome\", \"Spartacus\", \"Egypt\", \"The Last Kingdom\" and \"I Claudius\". Tudor England is also a very prominent subject in television series like \"The Tudors\", \"The Virgin Queen\" and \"Elizabeth I\". Programs about the Napoleonic Wars have also been produced, like \"Sharpe\" and \"Hornblower\". Historical soap operas have also been popular, including the Turkish TV series \"The Magnificent Century\" and \"\". Chinese studios have also produced television series like \"The Legend and the Hero\", its \"sequel series\", \"King's War\" and \"The Qin Empire\". There have also been produced pure , many based on works by Jin Yong like \"Condor Trilogy\" and \"Swordsman\", also \"Lu Xiaofeng\" and \"Chu Liuxiang\" by Gu Long. They have been very popular in China, but largely unnoticed in Western media.\nThe theatre.\nHistory plays.\nHistory is one of the three main genres in Western theatre alongside tragedy and comedy, although it originated, in its modern form, thousands of years later than the other primary genres. For this reason, it is often treated as a subset of tragedy. A play in this genre is known as a history play and is based on a historical narrative, often set in the medieval or early modern past. History emerged as a distinct genre from tragedy in Renaissance England. The best known examples of the genre are the history plays written by William Shakespeare, whose plays still serve to define the genre. Shakespeare wrote numerous history plays, some included in the First Folio as histories, and other listed as tragedies, or Roman plays. Among the most famous histories are \"Richard III\", and \"Henry IV, Part 1\", \"Henry IV, Part 2\", and \"Henry V\". Other plays that feature historical characters, are the tragedy \"Macbeth\", set in the mid-11th century during the reigns of Duncan I of Scotland and Edward the Confessor, and the Roman plays \"Coriolanus\", \"Julius Caesar\", and \"Antony and Cleopatra\". Another tragedy \"King Lear\", is based on British legend, as is the romanc \"Cymbeline, King of Britain\", which is set in Ancient Britain.\nOther playwrights contemporary to Shakespeare, such as Christopher Marlowe, also dramatized historical topics. Marlowe wrote \"Edward the Second\" which deals with the deposition of King Edward II by his barons and the Queen, who resent the undue influence the king's favourites have in court and state affairs, and \"The Massacre at Paris\", which dramatizes the events of the Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre in France in 1572. Marlowe's \"Tamburlaine the Great\" (1587 or 1588) is a play in two parts, loosely based on the life of the Central Asian emperor, Timur \"the lame\".\nHistory plays also appear elsewhere in other western literature. The German authors Goethe and Schiller wrote a number of historical plays, including Goethe's \"Egmont\" (1788), which is set in the 16th century, and is heavily influenced by Shakespearean tragedy, and Schiller's \"Mary Stuart\", which depicts the last days of Mary, Queen of Scots (1800). This play formed the basis for Donizetti's opera \"Maria Stuarda\" (1834). Beethoven wrote incidental music for \"Egmont\".\nLater Irish author George Bernard Shaw wrote several histories, including \"Caesar and Cleopatra\" (1898) and \"Saint Joan\", which based on the life and trial of Joan of Arc. Published in 1924, not long after the canonization of Joan of Arc by the Roman Catholic Church, the play dramatises what is known of her life based on the substantial records of her trial. One of the most famous 20th-century history plays is \"The Life of Galileo\" by Bertolt Brecht which dramatises the latter period of the life of Galileo Galilei, the great Italian natural philosopher, who was persecuted by the Roman Catholic Church for the promulgation of his scientific discoveries; for details, see Galileo affair. The play embraces such themes as the conflict between dogmatism and scientific evidence, as well as interrogating the values of constancy in the face of oppression.\nMore recently British dramatist Howard Brenton has written several histories. He gained notoriety for his play \"The Romans in Britain\", first staged at the National Theatre in October 1980, which drew parallels between the Roman invasion of Britain in 54BC and the contemporary British military presence in Northern Ireland. Its concerns with politics were, however, overshadowed by controversy surrounding a rape scene. Brenton also wrote \"Anne Boleyn\" a play on the life of Anne Boleyn, which premiered at Shakespeare's Globe in 2010. Anne Boleyn is portrayed as a significant force in the political and religious in-fighting at court and a furtherer of the cause of Protestantism in her enthusiasm for the Tyndale Bible.\nOpera.\nOne of the first operas to use historical events and people is Claudio Monteverdi's L'incoronazione di Poppea, which was first performed in Venice during the 1643 carnival season. it describes how Poppaea, mistress of the Roman emperor Nero, is able to achieve her ambition and be crowned empress. The opera was revived in Naples in 1651, but was then neglected until the rediscovery of the score in 1888, after which it became the subject of scholarly attention in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1960s, the opera has been performed and recorded many times. George Frederick Handel also wrote several operas based on historical characters, including \"Giulio Cesare\" (1724), \"Tamerlano\" (1724) and \"Rodelinda\" (1725).\nHistorical subjects for operas also developed during the 19th century. Usually with 4 or 5 acts, they are large-scale casts and orchestras, and spectacular staging. Several operas by Gaspare Spontini, Luigi Cherubini, and Gioachino Rossini can be regarded as precursors to French grand opera. These include Spontini's \"La vestale\" (1807) and \"Fernand Cortez\" (1809, revised 1817), Cherubini's \"Les Abenc\u00e9rages\" (1813), and Rossini's \"Le si\u00e8ge de Corinthe\" (1827) and \"Mo\u00efse et Pharaon\" (1828). All of these have some of the characteristics of size and spectacle that are normally associated with French grand opera. Another important forerunner was \"Il crociato in Egitto\" by Meyerbeer, who eventually became the acknowledged king of the grand opera genre. Amongst the most important opera composers on historical topics are Giuseppe Verdi, and Richard Wagner.\nRussian composers also wrote operas based on historical figures, including \"Boris Godunov\" by Modest Mussorgsky (1839\u20131881), which was composed between 1868 and 1873, and is considered his masterpiece. Its subjects are the Russian ruler Boris Godunov, who reigned as Tsar (1598 to 1605). Equally famous is Alexander Borodin's \"Prince Igor\", the libretto for which the composer developed from the Ancient Russian epic \"The Lay of Igor's Host\", which recounts the campaign of Rus prince Igor Svyatoslavich against the invading Cuman (\"Polovtsian\") tribes in 1185.\nHistorical reenactment.\nHistorical reenactment is an educational or entertainment activity in which people follow a plan to recreate aspects of a historical event or period. This may be as narrow as a specific moment from a battle, such as the reenactment of Pickett's Charge presented during the Great Reunion of 1913, or as broad as an entire period, such as Regency reenactment or The 1920s Berlin Project.\nTheory and criticism.\nThe Marxist literary critic, essayist, and social theorist Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs wrote extensively on the aesthetic and political significance of the historical novel. In 1937's \"Der historische Roman\", published originally in Russian, Luk\u00e1cs developed critical readings of several historical novels by various authors, including Gottfried Keller, Charles Dickens, and Gustave Flaubert. He interprets the advent of the \"genuinely\" historical novel at the beginning of the 19th century in terms of two developments, or processes. The first is the development of a specific genre in a specific medium\u2014the historical novel's unique stylistic and narrative elements. The second is the development of a representative, organic artwork that can capture the fractures, contradictions, and problems of the particular productive mode of its time (i.e., developing, early, entrenched capitalism).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In France, Hugo is renowned for his poetry collections, such as and (\"The Legend of the Ages\"). Hugo was at the forefront of the Romantic literary movement with his play \"Cromwell\" and drama \"Hernani\". His works have inspired music, both during his lifetime and after his death, including the opera \"Rigoletto\" and the musicals \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\" and \"Notre-Dame de Paris\". He produced more than 4,000 drawings in his lifetime, and campaigned for social causes such as the abolition of capital punishment and slavery.\nAlthough he was a committed royalist when young, Hugo's views changed as the decades passed, and he became a passionate supporter of republicanism, serving in politics as both deputy and senator. His work touched upon most of the political and social issues and the artistic trends of his time. His opposition to absolutism, and his literary stature, established him as a national hero. Hugo died on 22 May 1885, aged 83. He was given a state funeral in the Panth\u00e9on of Paris, which was attended by over two million people, the largest in French history.\nEarly life.\nVictor-Marie Hugo was born on 26 February 1802 (7 Vent\u00f4se, year X of the Republic) in in Eastern France. He was the youngest son of Joseph L\u00e9opold Sigisbert Hugo, a general in the Napoleonic army, and Sophie Tr\u00e9buchet. The couple had two other sons: Abel Joseph and . The Hugo family came from Nancy in Lorraine, where Hugo's grandfather was a wood merchant. L\u00e9opold enlisted in the army of Revolutionary France at fourteen. He was an atheist and an ardent supporter of the Republic. Hugo's mother Sophie was loyal to the deposed dynasty but would declare her children to be Protestants. They met in Ch\u00e2teaubriant in 1796 and married the following year.\nSince Hugo's father was an officer in Napoleon's army, the family moved frequently from posting to posting. L\u00e9opold Hugo wrote to his son that he had been conceived on one of the highest peaks in the Vosges Mountains, on a journey from Lun\u00e9ville to Besan\u00e7on. \"This elevated origin,\" he went on, \"seems to have had effects on you so that your muse is now continually sublime.\" Hugo believed himself to have been conceived on 24 June 1801, which is the origin of Jean Valjean's prisoner number 24601.\nIn 1810, Hugo's father was made Count Hugo de Cogolludo y Sig\u00fcenza by then King of Spain Joseph Bonaparte, though it seems that the Spanish title was not legally recognized in France. Hugo later titled himself as a viscount, and it was as \"Vicomte Victor Hugo\" that he was appointed a peer of France on 13 April 1845.\nWeary of the constant moving required by military life, Sophie separated temporarily from L\u00e9opold and settled in Paris in 1803 with her sons. There, she began seeing General Victor Fanneau de La Horie, Hugo's godfather, who had been a comrade of General Hugo's during the campaign in Vendee. In October 1807, the family rejoined Leopold, now Colonel Hugo, Governor of the province of Avellino. There, Hugo was taught mathematics by Giuseppe de Samuele Cagnazzi, elder brother of Italian scientist Luca de Samuele Cagnazzi. Sophie found out that Leopold had been living in secret with an Englishwoman called Catherine Thomas.\nSoon, Hugo's father was called to Spain to fight the Peninsular War. Madame Hugo and her children were sent back to Paris in 1808, where they moved to an old convent, 12 , an isolated mansion in a deserted quarter of the left bank of the Seine. Hiding in a chapel at the back of the garden was de La Horie, who had conspired to restore the Bourbons and been condemned to death a few years earlier. He became a mentor to Hugo and his brothers.\nIn 1811, the family joined their father in Spain. Hugo and his brothers were sent to school in Madrid at the while Sophie returned to Paris on her own, now officially separated from her husband. In 1812, as the Peninsular War was turning against France, de La Horie was arrested and executed. In February 1815, Hugo and Eug\u00e8ne were taken away from their mother and placed by their father in the Pension Cordier, a private boarding school in Paris, where Hugo and Eug\u00e8ne remained for three years while also attending lectures at Lyc\u00e9e Louis le Grand.\nOn 10 July 1816, Hugo wrote in his diary: \"I shall be Chateaubriand or nothing.\" In 1817, he wrote a poem for a competition organised by the Academie Fran\u00e7aise, for which he received an honorable mention. The Academicians refused to believe that he was only fifteen. Hugo moved in with his mother to 18 the following year and began attending law school. Hugo fell in love and secretly became engaged, against his mother's wishes, to his childhood friend Ad\u00e8le Foucher. In June 1821, Sophie Trebuchet died, and L\u00e9opold married his long-time mistress Catherine Thomas a month later. Hugo married Ad\u00e8le the following year. In 1819, Hugo and his brothers began publishing a periodical called .\nCareer.\nHugo published his first novel (\"Hans of Iceland\", 1823) the year following his marriage, and his second three years later (\"Bug-Jargal\", 1826). Between 1829 and 1840, he published five more volumes of poetry: Les Orientales, 1829; Les Feuilles d'automne, 1831; Les Chants du cr\u00e9puscule, 1835; Les Voix int\u00e9rieures, 1837; and Les Rayons et les Ombres, 1840. This cemented his reputation as one of the greatest elegiac and lyric poets of his time.\nLike many young writers of his generation, Hugo was profoundly influenced by , the famous figure in the literary movement of Romanticism and France's pre-eminent literary figure during the early 19th century. In his youth, Hugo resolved to be \" or nothing\", and his life would come to parallel that of his predecessor in many ways. Like , Hugo furthered the cause of Romanticism, became involved in politics (though mostly as a champion of Republicanism), and was forced into exile due to his political stances. Along with Chateaubriand he attended the Coronation of Charles X in Reims in 1825.\nThe precocious passion and eloquence of Hugo's early work brought success and fame at an early age. His first collection of poetry () was published in 1822 when he was only 20 years old and earned him a royal pension from Louis XVIII. Though the poems were admired for their spontaneous fervor and fluency, the collection that followed four years later in 1826 () revealed Hugo to be a great poet, a natural master of lyric and creative song.\nVictor Hugo's first mature work of fiction was published in February 1829 by Charles Gosselin without the author's name and reflected the acute social conscience that would infuse his later work. (\"The Last Day of a Condemned Man\") would have a profound influence on later writers such as Albert Camus, Charles Dickens, and Fyodor Dostoyevsky. \"Claude Gueux,\" a documentary short story about a real-life murderer who had been executed in France, was published in 1834. Hugo himself later considered it to be a precursor to his great work on social injustice, .\nHugo became the figurehead of the Romantic literary movement with the plays \"Cromwell\" (1827) and \"Hernani\" (1830). \"Hernani\" announced the arrival of French romanticism: performed at the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise, it was greeted with several nights of rioting as romantics and traditionalists clashed over the play's deliberate disregard for neo-classical rules. Hugo's popularity as a playwright grew with subsequent plays, such as \"Marion Delorme\" (1831), \"Le roi s'amuse\" (1832), and \"Ruy Blas\" (1838). Hugo's novel (\"The Hunchback of Notre-Dame\") was published in 1831 and quickly translated into other languages across Europe. One of the effects of the novel was to shame the City of Paris into restoring the much neglected Cathedral of Notre Dame, which was attracting thousands of tourists who had read the popular novel.\nHugo began planning a major novel about social misery and injustice as early as the 1830s, but a full 17 years were needed for to be realised and finally published in 1862. Hugo had previously used the departure of prisoners for the Bagne of Toulon in \"Le Dernier Jour d'un condamn\u00e9\". He went to Toulon to visit the Bagne in 1839 and took extensive notes, though he did not start writing the book until 1845. On one of the pages of his notes about the prison, he wrote in large block letters a possible name for his hero: \"JEAN TR\u00c9JEAN\". When the book was finally written, Tr\u00e9jean became Jean Valjean.\nHugo was acutely aware of the quality of the novel, as evidenced in a letter he wrote to his publisher, Albert Lacroix, on 23 March 1862: \"My conviction is that this book is going to be one of the peaks, if not the crowning point of my work.\" Publication of \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\" went to the highest bidder. The Belgian publishing house and undertook a marketing campaign unusual for the time, issuing press releases about the work a full six months before the launch. It also initially published only the first part of the novel (\"Fantine\"), which was launched simultaneously in major cities. Installments of the book sold out within hours and had an enormous impact on French society.\nThe critical establishment was generally hostile to the novel; found it insincere, complained of its vulgarity, found within it \"neither truth nor greatness\", the brothers lambasted its artificiality, and \u2014despite giving favourable reviews in newspapers\u2014castigated it in private as \"repulsive and inept\". However, \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\" proved popular enough with the masses that the issues it highlighted were soon on the agenda of the National Assembly of France. Today, the novel remains his best-known work. It is popular worldwide and has been adapted for cinema, television, and stage shows.\nAn apocryphal tale has circulated, describing the shortest correspondence in history as having been between Hugo and his publisher Hurst and Blackett in 1862. Hugo was on vacation when was published. He queried the reaction to the work by sending a single-character telegram to his publisher, asking ?. The publisher replied with a single ! to indicate its success. Hugo turned away from social/political issues in his next novel, (\"Toilers of the Sea\"), published in 1866. The book was well received, perhaps due to the previous success of . Dedicated to the channel island of Guernsey, where Hugo spent 15 years of exile, the novel tells of a man who attempts to win the approval of his beloved's father by rescuing his ship, intentionally marooned by its captain who hopes to escape with a treasure of money it is transporting, through an exhausting battle of human engineering against the force of the sea and an almost mythical beast of the sea, a giant squid. Superficially an adventure, one of Hugo's biographers calls it a \"metaphor for the 19th century\u2013technical progress, creative genius and hard work overcoming the immanent evil of the material world.\"\nThe word used in Guernsey to refer to squid (, also sometimes applied to octopus) was to enter the French language as a result of its use in the book. Hugo returned to political and social issues in his next novel, (\"The Man Who Laughs\"), which was published in 1869 and painted a critical picture of the aristocracy. The novel was not as successful as his previous efforts, and Hugo himself began to comment on the growing distance between himself and literary contemporaries such as and , whose realist and naturalist novels were now exceeding the popularity of his own work.\nHis last novel, (\"Ninety-Three\"), published in 1874, dealt with a subject that Hugo had previously avoided: the Reign of Terror during the French Revolution. Though Hugo's popularity was on the decline at the time of its publication, many now consider \"Ninety-Three\" to be a work on par with Hugo's better-known novels.\nPolitical life and exile.\nAfter three unsuccessful attempts, Hugo was finally elected to the in 1841, solidifying his position in the world of French arts and letters. A group of French academicians, particularly , were fighting against the \"romantic evolution\" and had managed to delay Victor Hugo's election. Thereafter, he became increasingly involved in French politics.\nOn the nomination of King , Hugo entered the Upper Chamber of Parliament as a in 1845, where he spoke against the death penalty and social injustice, and in favour of freedom of the press and self-government for Poland.\nIn 1848, Hugo was elected to the National Assembly of the Second Republic as a conservative. In 1849, he broke with the conservatives when he gave a noted speech calling for the end of misery and poverty. Other speeches called for universal suffrage and free education for all children. Hugo's advocacy to abolish the death penalty was renowned internationally.\nWhen Louis Napoleon (Napoleon III) seized complete power in 1851, establishing an anti-parliamentary constitution, Hugo openly declared him a traitor to France. He moved to Brussels, then Jersey, from which he was expelled for supporting \"L'Homme\", a local newspaper that had published a letter to Queen Victoria by a French republican deemed treasonous. He finally settled with his family at Hauteville House in Saint Peter Port, Guernsey, where he would live in exile from October 1855 until 1870.\nWhile in exile, Hugo published his famous political pamphlets against Napoleon III, and . The pamphlets were banned in France but nonetheless had a strong impact there. He also composed or published some of his best work during his period in Guernsey, including and three widely praised collections of poetry (, 1853; , 1856; and , 1859).\nHowever, V\u00edctor Hugo said in \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The wretched moral character of Th\u00e9nardier, the frustrated bourgeois, was hopeless; it was in America what it had been in Europe. Contact with a wicked man is sometimes enough to rot a good deed and cause something bad to come out of it. With Marius's money, Th\u00e9nardier became a slave trader.\nLike most of his contemporaries, Hugo justified colonialism in terms of a civilizing mission and putting an end to the slave trade on the Barbary coast. In a speech delivered on 18 May 1879, during a banquet to celebrate the abolition of slavery, in the presence of the French abolitionist writer and parliamentarian Victor Sch\u0153lcher, Hugo declared that the Mediterranean Sea formed a natural divide between \"ultimate civilisation and... utter barbarism.\" Hugo declared that \"God offers Africa to Europe. Take it\" and \"in the nineteenth century the white man made a man out of the black, in the twentieth century Europe will make a world out of Africa\".\nThis might partly explain why, in spite of his deep interest and involvement in political matters, he remained silent on the Algerian issue. He knew about the atrocities committed by the French Army during the French conquest of Algeria as evidenced by his diary but he never denounced them publicly; however, in \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\", Hugo wrote: \"Algeria too harshly conquered, and, as in the case of India by the English, with more barbarism than civilization.\"\nAfter coming in contact with Victor Sch\u0153lcher, a writer who fought for the abolition of slavery and French colonialism in the Caribbean, he started strongly campaigning against slavery. In a letter to American abolitionist Maria Weston Chapman, on 6 July 1851, Hugo wrote: \"Slavery in the United States! It is the duty of this republic to set such a bad example no longer... The United States must renounce slavery, or they must renounce liberty.\" In 1859, he wrote a letter asking the United States government, for the sake of their own reputation in the future, to spare abolitionist John Brown's life, Hugo justified Brown's actions by these words: \"Assuredly, if insurrection is ever a sacred duty, it must be when it is directed against Slavery.\" Hugo agreed to diffuse and sell one of his best known drawings, \"Le Pendu\", an homage to John Brown, so one could \"keep alive in souls the memory of this liberator of our black brothers, of this heroic martyr John Brown, who died for Christ just as Christ.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Only one slave on Earth is enough to dishonour the freedom of all men. So the abolition of slavery is, at this hour, the supreme goal of the thinkers.\u2014\u200a\nAs a novelist, diarist, and member of Parliament, Victor Hugo fought a lifelong battle for the abolition of the death penalty. \"The Last Day of a Condemned Man\" published in 1829 analyses the pangs of a man awaiting execution; several entries in \"Things Seen\" (\"Choses vues\"), the diary he kept between 1830 and 1885, convey his firm condemnation of what he regarded as a barbaric sentence; on 15 September 1848, seven months after the Revolution of 1848, he delivered a speech before the Assembly and concluded, \"You have overthrown the throne. ... Now overthrow the scaffold.\" His influence was credited in the removal of the death penalty from the constitutions of Geneva, Portugal, and Colombia. He had also pleaded for Benito Ju\u00e1rez to spare the recently captured emperor Maximilian I of Mexico, but to no avail.\nAlthough Napoleon III granted an amnesty to all political exiles in 1859, Hugo declined, as it meant he would have to curtail his criticisms of the government. It was only after Napoleon III fell from power and the Third Republic was proclaimed that Hugo finally returned to his homeland in 1870, where he was promptly elected to the National Assembly and the Senate.\nHe was in Paris during the siege by the Prussian Army in 1870, famously eating animals given to him by the Paris Zoo. As the siege continued, and food became ever more scarce, he wrote in his diary that he was reduced to \"eating the unknown\".\nDuring the Paris Commune\u2014the revolutionary government that took power on 18 March 1871 and was toppled on 28 May\u2014Victor Hugo was harshly critical of the atrocities committed on both sides. On 9 April, he wrote in his diary, \"In short, this Commune is as idiotic as the National Assembly is ferocious. From both sides, folly.\" Yet he made a point of offering his support to members of the Commune subjected to brutal repression. He had been in Brussels since 22 March 1871 when in the 27 May issue of the Belgian newspaper \"l'Ind\u00e9pendance\" Victor Hugo denounced the government's refusal to grant political asylum to the Communards threatened with imprisonment, banishment or execution. This caused so much uproar that in the evening a mob of fifty to sixty men attempted to force their way into the writer's house shouting, \"Death to Victor Hugo! Hang him! Death to the scoundrel!\"\nHugo, who said \"A war between Europeans is a civil war,\" was a strong advocate for the creation of the United States of Europe. He expounded his views on the subject in a speech he delivered during the International Peace Congress which took place in Paris in 1849. Here he declared \"nations of the continent, will, without losing your distinctive qualities and glorious individuality, be blended into a superior unity and constitute a European fraternity, just as Normandy, Brittany, Burgundy, Lorraine, have been blended into France\", this new state would be administered by \"a great Sovereign senate which will be to Europe what the Parliament is to England\".\nBecause of his concern for the rights of artists and copyright, he was a founding member of the , which led to the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works. However, in 's published archives, he states strongly that \"any work of art has two authors: the people who confusingly feel something, a creator who translates these feelings, and the people again who consecrate his vision of that feeling. When one of the authors dies, the rights should totally be granted back to the other, the people.\" He was one of the earlier supporters of the concept of \"domaine public payant\", under which a nominal fee would be charged for copying or performing works in the public domain, and this would go into a common fund dedicated to helping artists, especially young people.\nReligious views.\nHugo's religious views changed radically over the course of his life. In his youth and under the influence of his mother, he identified as a Catholic and professed respect for Church hierarchy and authority. From there he became a non-practising Catholic and increasingly expressed anti-Catholic and anti-clerical views. He frequented spiritism during his exile (where he participated also in many s\u00e9ances conducted by Madame Delphine de Girardin) and in later years settled into a rationalist deism similar to that espoused by Voltaire. A census-taker asked Hugo in 1872 if he was a Catholic, and he replied, \"No. A Freethinker.\"\nAfter 1872, Hugo never lost his antipathy towards the Catholic Church. He felt the Church was indifferent to the plight of the working class under the oppression of the monarchy. Perhaps he also was upset by the frequency with which his work appeared on the Church's list of banned books. Hugo counted 740 attacks on \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\" in the Catholic press. When Hugo's sons Charles and died, he insisted that they be buried without a crucifix or priest. In his will, he made the same stipulation about his own death and funeral.\nYet he believed in life after death and prayed every single morning and night, convinced as he wrote in \"The Man Who Laughs\" that \"Thanksgiving has wings and flies to its right destination. Your prayer knows its way better than you do.\"\nHugo's rationalism can be found in poems such as \"Torquemada\" (1869, about religious fanaticism), \"The Pope\" (1878, anti-clerical), \"Religions and Religion\" (1880, denying the usefulness of churches) and, published posthumously, \"The End of Satan\" and \"God\" (1886 and 1891 respectively, in which he represents Christianity as a griffin and rationalism as an angel). \n\"The Hunchback of Notre-Dame\" also garnered attention due to its portrayal of the abuse of power by the church, even getting listed as one of the \"forbidden books\" by it. In fact, earlier adaptations had to change the villain, Claude Frollo from being a priest to avoid backlash.\nVincent van Gogh ascribed the saying \"Religions pass away, but God remains,\" actually by Jules Michelet, to Hugo.\nRelationship with music.\nAlthough Hugo's many talents did not include exceptional musical ability, he nevertheless had a great impact on the music world through the inspiration that his works provided for composers of the 19th and 20th centuries. Hugo himself particularly enjoyed the music of Gluck, Mozart, Weber and Meyerbeer. In , he calls the huntsman's chorus in Weber's \"Euryanthe\" \"perhaps the most beautiful piece of music ever composed\". He also greatly admired Beethoven and, rather unusually for his time, appreciated works by composers from earlier centuries such as Palestrina and Monteverdi.\nTwo famous musicians of the 19th century were friends of Hugo: Hector Berlioz and Franz Liszt. The latter played Beethoven in Hugo's home, and Hugo joked in a letter to a friend that, thanks to Liszt's piano lessons, he learned how to play a favourite song on the piano \u2013 with only one finger. \nHugo also worked with composer Louise Bertin, writing the libretto for her 1836 opera \"La Esmeralda\", which was based on the character in \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\". Although for various reasons the opera closed soon after its fifth performance and is little known today, it has enjoyed a modern revival, both in a piano/song concert version by Liszt at the 2007 and in a full orchestral version presented in July 2008 at . Nineteenth century French composer Eugenie Santa Coloma Sourget also used Hugo\u2019s texts in her songs. \nHugo was also on friendly terms with Frederic Chopin. He introduced him to Amantine de Francueil (known as \"George Sand\" despite being female) who became Chopin's lover. In 1849, Hugo attended Chopin's funeral. \nOn the other hand, he had low esteem for Richard Wagner, whom he described as \"a man of talent coupled with imbecility.\"\nWell over one thousand musical compositions have been inspired by Hugo's works from the 19th century until the present day. In particular, Hugo's plays, in which he rejected the rules of classical theatre in favour of romantic drama, attracted the interest of many composers who adapted them into operas. More than one hundred operas are based on Hugo's works and among them are Donizetti's \"Lucrezia Borgia\" (1833), Verdi's (1851) and \"Ernani\" (1844), and 's (1876).\nHugo's novels, as well as his plays, have been a great source of inspiration for musicians, stirring them to create not only opera and ballet but musical theatre such as and the ever-popular , London's West End's longest running musical. Moreover, Hugo's poems have attracted an exceptional amount of interest from musicians, and numerous melodies have been based on his poetry by composers such as , , , , , , , , Rachmaninoff, and .\nToday, Hugo's work continues to stimulate musicians to create new compositions. For example, Hugo's novel against capital punishment, \"The Last Day of a Condemned Man\", was adapted into an opera by , with a libretto by and premi\u00e8red by their brother, tenor , in 2007. In Guernsey, every two years, the Victor Hugo International Music Festival attracts a wide range of musicians and the premiere of songs specially commissioned from such composers as , , , and and based on Hugo's poetry.\nRemarkably, not only has Hugo's literary production been the source of inspiration for musical works, but also his political writings have received attention from musicians and have been adapted to music. For instance, in 2009, Italian composer Matteo Sommacal was commissioned by Festival \"Bagliori d'autore\" and wrote a piece for speaker and chamber ensemble entitled \"Actes et paroles\", with a text elaborated by Chiara Piola Caselli after Victor Hugo's last political speech addressed to the Assembl\u00e9e l\u00e9gislative, \"Sur la Revision de la Constitution\" (18 July 1851), and premiered in Rome on 19 November 2009, in the auditorium of the Institut fran\u00e7ais, Centre Saint-Louis, French Embassy to the Holy See, by Piccola Accademia degli Specchi featuring the composer Matthias Kadar.\nDeclining years and death.\nWhen Hugo returned to Paris in 1870, the country hailed him as a national hero. He was confident that he would be offered the dictatorship, as shown by the notes he kept at the time: \"Dictatorship is a crime. This is a crime I am going to commit,\" but he felt he had to assume that responsibility. Despite his popularity, Hugo lost his bid for re-election to the National Assembly in 1872.\nThroughout his life Hugo kept believing in unstoppable humanistic progress. In his last public address on 3 August 1879 he prophesied, in an over-optimistic way, \"In the twentieth century war will be dead, the scaffold will be dead, hatred will be dead, frontier boundaries will be dead, dogmas will be dead; man will live.\"\nWithin a brief period, he suffered a mild stroke, his daughter Ad\u00e8le was interned in an insane asylum, and his two sons died. (Ad\u00e8le's biography inspired the movie \"The Story of Adele H.\") His wife Ad\u00e8le had died in 1868.\nHis faithful mistress Juliette Drouet died in 1883, only two years before his own death. \nDespite his personal loss, Hugo remained committed to the cause of political change. On 30 January 1876, he was elected to the newly created Senate. This last phase of his political career was considered a failure. Hugo was a maverick and achieved little in the Senate. He suffered a mild stroke on 27 June 1878. To honour the fact that he was entering his 80th year, he received one of the greatest tributes to a living writer ever held. The celebrations began on 25 June 1881, when Hugo was presented with a vase, the traditional gift for sovereigns. On 27 June, one of the largest parades in French history was held.\nMarchers stretched from the , where the author was living, down the , and all the way to the centre of Paris. The paraders marched for six hours past Hugo as he sat at the window at his house. Every inch and detail of the event was for Hugo; the official guides even wore cornflowers as an allusion to Fantine's song in . On 28 June, the city of Paris changed the name of the Avenue d'Eylau to Avenue Victor-Hugo. Letters addressed to the author were from then on labelled \"To Mister Victor Hugo, In his avenue, Paris\". Two days before dying, he left a note with these last words: \"To love is to act.\"\nOn 20 May 1885, \"le Petit Journal\" published the official medical bulletin on Hugo's health condition. \"The illustrious patient\" was fully conscious and aware that there was no hope for him. They also reported from a reliable source that at one point in the night he had whispered the following , \"En moi c\u2019est le combat du jour et de la nuit.\"\u2014\"In me, this is the battle between day and night.\" \"Le Matin\" published a slightly different version: \"Here is the battle between day and night.\"\nHugo died on 22 May 1885, at 50 Avenue Victor Hugo (now number 124). His death, from pneumonia, generated intense national mourning. He was not only revered as a towering figure in literature, he was a statesman who shaped the Third Republic and democracy in France. All his life he remained a defender of liberty, equality and fraternity as well as an adamant champion of French culture. In 1877, aged 75, he wrote, \"I am not one of these sweet-tempered old men. I am still exasperated and violent. I shout and I feel indignant and I cry. Woe to anyone who harms France! I do declare I will die a fanatic patriot.\"\nAlthough he had requested a pauper's funeral, by decree of President Jules Gr\u00e9vy he was awarded a state funeral, an event described by Nietzsche as a \"veritable orgy of bad taste\". More than two million people joined Hugo's funeral procession in Paris from the to the , where he was buried. He shares a crypt within the with and . Most large French towns and cities have a street or square named after him.\nHugo left five sentences as his last will, to be officially published:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDrawings.\nHugo produced more than 4,000 drawings, with about 3,000 drawings still in existence. Originally pursued as a casual hobby, drawing became more important to Hugo shortly before his exile when he made the decision to stop writing to devote himself to politics. Drawing became his exclusive creative outlet between 1848 and 1851.\nHugo worked only on paper, and on a small scale; usually in dark brown or black pen-and-ink wash, sometimes with touches of white, and rarely with colour.\nPersonal life.\nFamily.\nMarriage.\nHugo married Ad\u00e8le Foucher in October 1822. Despite their respective affairs, they lived together for nearly 46 years until she died in August 1868. Hugo, who was still banished from France, was unable to attend her funeral in Villequier, where their daughter L\u00e9opoldine was buried. From 1830 to 1837, Ad\u00e8le had an affair with Charles-Augustin Sainte Beuve, a reviewer and writer.\nChildren.\nAd\u00e8le and Victor Hugo had their first child, L\u00e9opold, in 1823, but the boy died in infancy. On 28 August 1824, the couple's second child, L\u00e9opoldine, was born, followed by Charles on 4 November 1826, Fran\u00e7ois-Victor on 28 October 1828, and Ad\u00e8le on 28 July 1830.\nHugo's eldest and favourite daughter, L\u00e9opoldine, died in 1843 at the age of 19, shortly after her marriage to Charles Vacquerie. On 4 September, she drowned in the Seine at Villequier when the boat she was in overturned. Her young husband died trying to save her. The death left her father devastated; Hugo was travelling at the time, in the south of France, when he first learned about L\u00e9opoldine's death from a newspaper that he read in a caf\u00e9.\nHe describes his shock and grief in his famous poem \"\u00c0 Villequier\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nHe wrote many poems afterward about his daughter's life and death. His most famous poem is \"Demain, d\u00e8s l'aube\" (Tomorrow, at Dawn), in which he describes visiting her grave.\nExile.\nHugo decided to live in exile after Napoleon III's coup d'\u00e9tat at the end of 1851. After leaving France, Hugo lived in Brussels briefly in 1851, and then moved to the Channel Islands, first to Jersey (1852\u20131855) and then to the smaller island of Guernsey in 1855, where he stayed until Napoleon III's fall from power in 1870. Although Napoleon III proclaimed a general amnesty in 1859, under which Hugo could have safely returned to France, the author stayed in exile, only returning when Napoleon III was removed from power by the creation of the French Third Republic in 1870, as a result of the French defeat at the Battle of Sedan in the Franco-Prussian War. After the Siege of Paris from 1870 to 1871, Hugo lived again in Guernsey from 1872 to 1873, and then finally returned to France for the remainder of his life. In 1871, after the death of his son Charles, Hugo took custody of his grandchildren Jeanne and Georges-Victor.\nOther relationships.\nJuliette Drouet.\nFrom February 1833 until her death in 1883, Juliette Drouet devoted her whole life to Victor Hugo, who never married her even after his wife died in 1868. He took her on his numerous trips and she followed him in exile on Guernsey. There Hugo rented a house for her near Hauteville House, his family home. She wrote some 20,000 letters in which she expressed her passion or vented her jealousy on her womanizing lover.\nOn 25 September 1870 during the Siege of Paris (19 September 1870 \u2013 28 January 1871) Hugo feared the worst. He left his children a note reading as follows:\n\"J.D.\nShe saved my life in December 1851. For me she underwent exile. Never has her soul forsaken mine. Let those who have loved me love her. Let those who have loved me respect her.\nShe is my widow.\"\nV.H.\nL\u00e9onie d'Aunet.\nFor more than seven years, L\u00e9onie d'Aunet, who was a married woman, was involved in a love relationship with Hugo. Both were caught in adultery on 5 July 1845. Hugo, who had been a Member of the Chamber of Peers since April, avoided condemnation whereas his mistress had to spend two months in prison and six in a convent. Many years after their separation, Hugo made a point of supporting her financially.\nOthers.\nHugo gave free rein to his libido until a few weeks before his death. He sought a wide variety of women of all ages, be they courtesans, actresses, prostitutes, admirers, servants or revolutionaries like Louise Michel for sexual activity. He systematically reported his casual affairs using his own code, as Samuel Pepys did, to make sure they would remain secret. For instance, he resorted to Latin abbreviations (\"osc.\" for kisses) or to Spanish (\"Misma. Mismas cosas\": The same. Same things). Homophones are frequent: \"Seins\" (Breasts) becomes Saint; \"Po\u00eble\" (Stove) actually refers to \"Poils\" (Pubic hair). Analogy also enabled him to conceal the real meaning: A woman's \"Suisses\" (Swiss) are her breasts\u2014because Switzerland is renowned for its milk. After a rendezvous with a young woman named \"Laetitia\" he would write \"Joie\" (Happiness) in his diary. If he added \"t.n.\" (\"toute nue\") he meant she stripped naked in front of him. The initials \"S.B.\" discovered in November 1875 may refer to Sarah Bernhardt.\nNicknames.\nVictor Hugo acquired several nicknames. The first one originated from his own description of Shakespeare in the introduction to his eponymous work. In this introduction to \"William Shakespeare (essay)\", he tried to delve into what constituted the genius of certain artists and described Shakespeare as an \"Ocean Man\":There were indeed ocean men.&lt;br&gt;[...] all of this could exist within a mind, and then that mind is called genius, and you have Aeschylus, you have Isaiah, you have Juvenal, you have Dante, you have Michelangelo, you have Shakespeare, and it is the same thing to gaze upon these souls or to gaze upon the Ocean.During his lifetime and in the 1870s, the expression to describe him entered popular culture. It was later adopted by authors and literary critics, including Joseph Serre, who identified it with an expression he himself coined. This nickname became widespread during the 20th century and was used by the National Library of France when organizing an exhibition about him. Since then, it has been frequently used in research and literary critics. Alongside \"Ocean Man,\" the nickname \"Horizon Man\" was sometimes used during Hugo's lifetime as well. Finally, researchers and literary critics, such as Henri Meschonnic, proposed the nickname \"Century Man\" to refer to Victor Hugo.\nMemorials.\nHis legacy has been honored in many ways, including his portrait being placed on French currency.\nThe people of Guernsey erected a statue by sculptor Jean Boucher in Candie Gardens (Saint Peter Port) to commemorate his stay in the islands. The City of Paris has preserved his residences Hauteville House, Guernsey, and , Paris, as museums. The house where he stayed in Vianden, Luxembourg, in 1871 has also become a commemorative museum.\nThe Avenue Victor-Hugo in the 16th arrondissement of Paris bears Hugo's name and links the to the vicinity of the by way of the . This square is served by a Paris M\u00e9tro stop also named in his honour. In the town of there is a main street, a school, hospital and several caf\u00e9s named after Hugo, and a number of streets and avenues throughout France are named after him. The school was founded in his town of birth, in France. , located in Shawinigan, Quebec, was named to honour him. A street in San Francisco, Hugo Street, is named for him.\nIn the city of Avellino, Italy, Victor Hugo briefly stayed in what is now known as when reuniting with his father, , in 1808. Hugo would later write about his brief stay here, quoting (\"It was a palace of marble\").\nThere is a statue of Hugo across from the Museo Carlo Bilotti in Rome, Italy.\nVictor Hugo is the namesake of the city of Hugoton, Kansas.\nIn Havana, Cuba, there is a park named after him.\nA bust of Hugo stands near the entrance of the Old Summer Palace in Beijing honoring his opposition to its destruction by British and French Forces during the Second Opium War.\nA mosaic commemorating Hugo is located on the ceiling of the Thomas Jefferson Building of the Library of Congress.\nThe London and North Western Railway named a 'Prince of Wales' Class 4-6-0 No 1134 after Hugo. British Railways perpetuated this memorial, naming Class 92 Electric Unit 92001 after him.\nHugo is venerated as a saint in the Vietnamese religion of , a new religion established in Vietnam in 1926.\nA crater on the planet Mercury is named after him.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The film stars Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight, with supporting roles played by Sylvia Miles, John McGiver, Brenda Vaccaro, Bob Balaban, Jennifer Salt and Barnard Hughes. Set in New York City, \"Midnight Cowboy\" depicts the unlikely friendship between two lost and lonely hustlers: na\u00efve prostitute Joe Buck (Voight) and ailing con man Rico Rizzo (Hoffman), referred to as \"Ratso\".\nAt the 42nd Academy Awards, the film won three awards: Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay. \"Midnight Cowboy\" is the only X-rated film (equivalent of the current NC-17 rating) to win Best Picture and the only X-rated film ever to win an Academy Award. It placed 36th on the American Film Institute's 1998 list of the 100 greatest American films of all time, and 43rd on its 2007 updated version.\nIn 1994, \"Midnight Cowboy\" was deemed \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress, and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.\nPlot.\nYoung Texan Joe Buck quits his dishwashing job, and heads by bus to New York City in cowboy attire to become a male prostitute. Initially unsuccessful, he finally beds a middle-aged woman, Cass, in her Park Avenue apartment. She is insulted when he requests payment, and Joe ultimately gives money to her.\nJoe meets Rico \"Ratso\" Rizzo, an indigent con man with a limp who takes $20 for introducing him to a pimp. After discovering that the alleged pimp is actually an unhinged religious fanatic, Joe flees and unsuccessfully searches for Rico. Joe spends his days wandering the city, listening to his Zenith portable radio and sitting in his hotel room. When his money runs out, management locks Joe out and impounds his belongings.\nIn an attempt to make money, Joe receives oral sex from a meek young man in a movie theater, but the man cannot pay. Joe threatens him, but releases him unharmed. The next day, Joe spots Rico at a diner, and angrily confronts him. Rico manages to calm Joe, and invites him to share his squalid, condemned apartment squat. Joe reluctantly accepts, and the two begin a \"business relationship\" as hustlers. Rico asks Joe to call him \"Rico\" instead of \"Ratso\", but Joe does not oblige. They struggle with severe poverty, stealing food and failing to get work for Joe. Joe pawns his radio and sells his blood, while Rico's persistent cough worsens during a winter without heat in the freezing apartment.\nIn intermittent flashbacks, Joe's grandmother raises him after his mother abandons him. He has a tragic relationship with Annie, disclosed through hazy flashbacks in which they are attacked and raped by a cowboy gang. Annie shows signs of mental trauma and is taken into an ambulance.\nRico tells Joe his father was an illiterate Italian immigrant shoeshiner whose job yielded a bad back and lung damage from inhaling shoe polish. Rico learned shoeshining from his father, but considers it degrading and generally refuses to do it. When he breaks into a stand and shines Joe's cowboy boots to attract clients, two police officers arrive and sit with their dirty boots next to Joe's. Rico dreams of escaping to Miami, shown in fantasies in which he and Joe frolic on a beach and are pampered at a resort, including a boy polishing Rico's boots.\nA Warhol-like filmmaker and an extrovert female artist approach Joe in a diner, taking his photograph and inviting him to a Warhol-esque art event. Joe and Rico attend, but Rico's poor health and hygiene attract unwanted attention. After mistaking a joint for a cigarette and receiving uppers, Joe hallucinates. He leaves with Shirley, a socialite who pays him $20 for spending the night, but Joe cannot perform sexually. They play Scribbage, and the resulting wordplay leads Shirley to suggest that Joe may be gay; suddenly, he is able to perform. The next morning, she sets up her female friend as Joe's client, and at last his career appears to be progressing.\nWhen Joe returns to the apartment, Rico is severely feverish. He refuses medical help, and begs Joe to put him on a bus to Florida. Desperate for cash, Joe picks up an effeminate middle-aged man in an arcade. The two return to the man's hotel room, where Joe demands money. However, when the man refuses to give him more than $10, Joe brutally beats, robs, and apparently smothers him. Joe buys two bus tickets to Florida with the stolen cash. Rico again tells Joe that he wants to be called \"Rico\", not \"Ratso\", and Joe finally begins to oblige. During the bus trip, Rico's health worsens, and he suffers from urinary incontinence.\nJoe buys new clothing for Rico and himself at a rest stop, discarding his cowboy outfit and boots. Back on the bus, Joe muses that there must be an easier way to make money than hustling, and tells Rico that he will get a regular job in Miami. When he does not respond, Joe realizes that Rico has died. Joe alerts the bus driver, who asks Joe to close Rico's eyelids, saying that they will soon be in Miami. With tears in his eyes, Joe sits with his arm around his dead friend as the bus continues past rows of Floridian palm trees.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProduction.\nThe opening scenes were filmed in Big Spring, Texas, in 1968. A roadside billboard, stating, \"If you don't have an oil well...get one!\", was shown as the New York-bound bus carrying Joe Buck rolled through Texas. Such advertisements, common in the Southwestern United States in the late 1960s and through the 1970s, promoted Eddie Chiles' Western Company of North America.\nIn the film, Joe stays at the Hotel Claridge, at the southeast corner of Broadway and West 44th Street in Midtown Manhattan. His room overlooked the northern half of Times Square. The building, designed by D. H. Burnham &amp; Company and opened in 1911, was demolished in 1972. A motif featured three times throughout the New York scenes was the sign atop of the facade of the Mutual of New York (MONY) Building at 1740 Broadway. It was extended into the \"Scribbage\" scene with Shirley the socialite, when Joe's incorrect spelling of the word \"money\" matched that of the sign.\nDustin Hoffman, who played a grizzled veteran of New York's streets, is from Los Angeles. Despite his portrayal of Joe Buck, a character hopelessly out of his element in New York, Jon Voight is a native New Yorker, hailing from Yonkers. Voight was paid \"scale\" (the Screen Actors Guild minimum wage) for his portrayal of Joe Buck, a concession he willingly made to obtain the part. Harrison Ford auditioned for the role of Joe Buck. Michael Sarrazin, who was Schlesinger's first choice, was cast as Joe Buck, only to be fired when unable to gain release from his contract with Universal.\nThe line, \"I'm walkin' here!\", which reached number 27 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes, is subject to differing accounts. Producer Jerome Hellman disputes the notion that it was an ad-lib on the two-disc DVD set of \"Midnight Cowboy\". The scene, which originally had Ratso pretend to be hit by a taxi to feign an injury, is written into the first draft of the original script. Hoffman, however, on an installment of Bravo's \"Inside the Actors Studio\", stated that there were many takes, with the actors hoping to get to the crosswalk at a red light so as not to have to wait for traffic while talking. In that take, they were able to cross the road without waiting, but a cab unexpectedly ran the red light and nearly hit them. Hoffman wanted to say, \"We're doing a movie here!\" and can be heard beginning to say as such in the final film, but he ultimately changed his sentence halfway and stayed in character as he berated the driver. As such, the latter's angry response is also unscripted.\nOn initial review by the Motion Picture Association of America, \"Midnight Cowboy\" received an \"R\" (\"Restricted\") rating. However, after consulting with a psychologist, executives at United Artists were told to accept an \"X\" rating, due to the \"homosexual frame of reference\" and its \"possible influence on youngsters\". The film was released with an X rating. The MPAA later broadened the requirements for the \"R\" rating to allow more content, and raised the age restriction from 16 to 17. The film was later rated \"R\" for a reissue in 1971.\nIt took several hours to shoot the rape scene, and Jennifer Salt recalls the evening as a traumatic ordeal for her. The wardrobe crew had given Jennifer a nude-colored body suit to wear, but the night was so hot and sticky that she quickly stripped it off. \"I felt that the most horrible thing in the world was that people were seeing my bare ass, and that was so humiliating I could not even discuss it. And this kid was just on top of me and all over me and it hurt and no one gave a fuck and it was supposed to look like I was being raped. And I was screaming, screaming, and it was traumatic in some way that couldn't be acknowledged.\"\nReception.\nCritical response to the film has been largely positive. Vincent Canby's lengthy 1969 review in \"The New York Times\" was blunt: \"a slick, brutal (but not brutalizing) movie version of... Herlihy's 1965 novel. It is tough and good in important ways, although its style is oddly romantic and at variance with the laconic material... As long as the focus is on this world of cafeterias and abandoned tenements, of desperate conjunctions in movie balconies and doorways, of ketchup and beans and canned heat, \"Midnight Cowboy\" is so rough and vivid that it's almost unbearable... \"Midnight Cowboy\" often seems to be exploiting its material for sensational or comic effect, but it is ultimately a moving experience that captures the quality of a time and a place. It's not a movie for the ages, but, having seen it, you won't ever again feel detached as you walk down West 42nd Street, avoiding the eyes of the drifters, stepping around the little islands of hustlers and closing your nostrils to the smell of rancid griddles.\"\nGene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" said of the film: \"I cannot recall a more marvelous pair of acting performances in any one film.\"\nIn a 25th-anniversary retrospective in 1994, Owen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" wrote: \"\"Midnight Cowboy\"'s peep-show vision of Manhattan lowlife may no longer be shocking, but what is shocking, in 1994, is to see a major studio film linger this lovingly on characters who have nothing to offer the audience but their own lost souls.\"\nAs of 2022, \"Midnight Cowboy\" holds an 89% approval rating on online review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 8.50/10, based on 116 reviews. The website's critical consensus states: \"John Schlesinger's gritty, unrelentingly bleak look at the seedy underbelly of urban American life is undeniably disturbing, but Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight's performances make it difficult to turn away.\"\nThe Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited this movie as one of his 100 favorite films.\nBox office.\nThe film opened at the Coronet Theatre in New York City, and grossed a house record $61,503 in its first week. In its tenth week of release, the film became number one in the United States, with a weekly gross of $550,237, and was the highest-grossing movie in September 1969. The film earned $11 million in rentals in the United States and Canada in 1969, and added a further $5.3 million the following year when it won the Academy Award for Best Picture. It eventually earned rentals of $20.5 million in the United States and Canada. By 1975, it had earned rentals of over $30 million worldwide.\nTelevision premiere.\nMore than five years after its theatrical release, \"Midnight Cowboy\" premiered on television November 3, 1974. Twenty-five minutes were edited from the film due to censorship regulations and a desire for broader appeal. Although the cuts were approved by director John Schlesinger, critic Kay Gardella of the New York \"Daily News\" said the film was \"hacked up pretty badly\".\nSoundtrack.\nJohn Barry composed the score, winning a Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Theme, although he did not receive an on-screen credit. Fred Neil's song, \"Everybody's Talkin'\", won a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Vocal Performance, Male for Harry Nilsson. Schlesinger chose the song as its theme, and the song underscores the first act. Other songs considered for the theme included Nilsson's own \"I Guess the Lord Must Be in New York City\" and Randy Newman's \"Cowboy\". Bob Dylan wrote \"Lay Lady Lay\" to serve as the theme song, but did not finish it in time. The movie's main theme, \"Midnight Cowboy\", features harmonica by Toots Thielemans, but the album version is played by Tommy Reilly. The soundtrack album was released by United Artists Records in 1969.\nLegacy.\nThe song \"Crazy Annie\" from the album \"Any Way That You Want Me\" by Evie Sands and co-written by Chip Taylor was inspired by the film.\nThe final scene on the bus was parodied in the \"Seinfeld\" episode \"The Mom &amp; Pop Store\". Jon Voight guest stars in the episode as himself.\nAustralian singer-songwriter Vance Joy references the film in his song \"Riptide\".\nThe making of the film, as well as the time it was made, is subject of the 2022 documentary feature \"Desperate Souls, Dark City and the Legend of Midnight Cowboy\" by Nancy Buirski.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As one of the key actors in the formation of New Hollywood, Hoffman is known for his versatile portrayals of antiheroes and emotionally vulnerable characters. Among his numerous accolades are two Academy Awards, four BAFTA Awards, five Golden Globe Awards, and two Primetime Emmy Awards as well as a nomination for a Tony Award. He was honored with the Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1997, the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1999, and the Kennedy Center Honors Award in 2012.\nHoffman studied at the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music before he decided to go into acting, for which he trained at the Pasadena Playhouse. He made his film debut with the black comedy \"The Tiger Makes Out\" (1967). He went on to receive two Academy Awards for Best Actor playing a man going through a divorce in \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" (1979) and an autistic savant in \"Rain Man\" (1988). He was Oscar-nominated for \"The Graduate\" (1967), \"Midnight Cowboy\" (1969), \"Lenny\" (1974), \"Tootsie\" (1982), and \"Wag the Dog\" (1997). Other notable roles include in \"Little Big Man\" (1970), \"Papillon\" (1973), \"Marathon Man\" (1976), \"All the President's Men\" (1976), \"Ishtar\" (1987), \"Dick Tracy\" (1990), and \"Hook\" (1991).\nIn the 21st century, he acted in films such as \"Finding Neverland\" (2004), \"I Heart Huckabees\" (2004), and \"Stranger than Fiction\" (2006), as well as \"Meet the Fockers\" (2004) and the sequel \"Little Fockers\" (2010), \"The Meyerowitz Stories\" (2017), and \"Megalopolis\" (2024). Hoffman has voiced roles in \"The Tale of Despereaux\" (2008) and the \"Kung Fu Panda\" film series (2008\u2013present). In 2012, he made his directorial debut with \"Quartet\".\nHoffman made his Broadway debut in the 1961 play \"A Cook for Mr. General\". He subsequently starred as Willy Loman in the 1984 revival of \"Death of a Salesman\" and reprised the role a year later in a television film, earning a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Actor in a Limited Series or Movie. In 1989, he received a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play nomination for his role as Shylock in \"The Merchant of Venice\". He has received three Drama Desk Awards, for his performances in \"Eh?\" (1967), \"Jimmy Shine\" (1969), and \"Death of a Salesman\" (1984), respectively.\nEarly life and education.\nDustin Lee Hoffman was born on August 8, 1937, in Los Angeles, California, the younger of two sons of Harry Hoffman (1902\u20131990) and Lillian (n\u00e9e Gold; 1907\u20131982). His father worked as a prop supervisor (set decorator) at Columbia Pictures before becoming a furniture salesman.\nHoffman was named after stage and silent screen actor Dustin Farnum. He has an elder brother Ronald, who is a lawyer and economist. Hoffman is Jewish, from an Ashkenazi Jewish family of immigrants from Kiev, Russian Empire, and Ia\u0219i, Romania. The family's surname was spelled \u0413\u043e\u0439\u0445\u043c\u0430\u043d (\"Goikhman\") in the Russian Empire.\nHis upbringing was nonreligious, and he has said, \"I don't have any memory of celebrating holidays growing up that were Jewish\", and that he had \"realized\" he was Jewish at around the age of 10.\nHoffman graduated from Los Angeles High School in 1955 and enrolled at Santa Monica College with the intention of studying medicine. But he decided to become an actor, and left in the following year to join the Pasadena Playhouse, although when he told his family about his career goal, his Aunt Pearl warned him, \"You can't be an actor. You are not good-looking enough.\" He also studied with Lee Strasberg and has stated that he did not study with either Sanford Meisner or Stella Adler.\nHoffman initially hoped to become a classical pianist, having studied piano during much of his youth and in college. While at Santa Monica College, he also took an acting class, which he assumed would be easy, and \"caught the acting bug\". He recalls: \"I just was not gifted in music. I did not have an ear.\" Now an aspiring actor, he spent the next 10 years doing odd jobs, being unemployed, and struggling to get any available acting roles, a lifestyle he was later to portray in the comedy film \"Tootsie\". Hoffman composed a song called \"Shooting the Breeze\", alongside Bette Midler who wrote the words.\nFilm career.\n1960\u20131966: Early theatre roles.\nHoffman's first acting role was at the Pasadena Playhouse, alongside future Academy Award\u2013winner Gene Hackman. After two years there, Hackman headed for New York City, with Hoffman soon following. Hoffman, Hackman, and Robert Duvall lived together in the 1960s, whilst all three of them focused on finding acting jobs. Hackman remembers, \"The idea that any of us would do well in films simply didn't occur to us. We just wanted to work\". Hoffman's appearance\u2014Duvall described him as Barbra Streisand in drag\u2014and small size made him uncastable, \"Vanity Fair\" later wrote. During this period, Hoffman got occasional television bit parts, including commercials but, needing income, he briefly left acting in order to teach.\nHoffman then studied at Actors Studio and became a dedicated method actor. In 1960 Hoffman was cast in a role in an off-Broadway production and followed with a bit part in his Broadway debut in production, \"A Cook for Mr. General\" (1961). In 1962, he appeared in Rabbit Run Theatre's summer stock production of \"Write Me a Murder\" in Madison, Ohio and served as an assistant director to Ulu Grosbard on \"The Days and Nights of Beebee Fenstermaker\" at off-Broadway's Sheridan Square Playhouse. In 1964, Hoffman appeared in \"Three Men on a Horse\" at Princeton's McCarter Theatre and in 1965, in off-Broadway's \"Harry, Noon and Night\" with Joel Grey. On June 23, 1965, he played Mendy in a practice run of Philip Roth's abandoned off-Broadway play \"The Nice Jewish Boy\", directed by Gene Saks and co-starring Melinda Dillon. Grosbard and Hoffman reunited for a 1965 recording of \"Death of a Salesman\" starring Lee J. Cobb and Mildred Dunnock, with Hoffman playing Bernard. He was assistant director for Grosbard's 1965 off-Broadway production of \"A View from the Bridge\" starring Robert Duvall and Jon Voight, and in late 1965 stage-managed and appeared in Grosbard's \"The Subject Was Roses\" on Broadway. Hoffman's \"sharply outlined and vividly colored\" performance in off-Broadway's \"The Journey of the Fifth Horse\" in April 1966 was followed by another critical success in the play \"Eh?\", by Henry Livings, which had its U.S. premiere at the Circle in the Square Theatre on October 16, 1966. Sidney W. Pink, a producer and 3D-movie pioneer, discovered Hoffman in one of his off-Broadway roles and cast him in \"Madigan's Millions\". Through the early and mid-1960s, Hoffman made appearances in television shows and movies, including \"Naked City\", \"The Defenders\" and \"Hallmark Hall of Fame\".\nHoffman starred in the 1966 off-Broadway play \"Eh?\", for which he received a Drama Desk Award. He made his film debut in \"The Tiger Makes Out\" in 1967, alongside Eli Wallach. In 1967, immediately after wrapping up principal filming on \"The Tiger Makes Out\", Hoffman flew from New York City to Fargo, North Dakota, where he directed productions of William Gibson's \"Two for the Seesaw\" and William Saroyan's \"The Time of Your Life\" for the Fargo-Moorhead Community Theatre. The $1,000 he received for the eight-week contract was all he had to hold him over until the funds from the movie materialized.\n1967\u20131969: \"The Graduate\" and breakthrough.\nDirector Mike Nichols auditioned Hoffman in 1966 for a lead role in the Broadway musical \"The Apple Tree\" but rejected him because he could not sing well enough, and gave Alan Alda the part. However, Nichols was so impressed with Hoffman's overall audition that he cast him as the male lead in the movie \"The Graduate\" (1967). This role was that of Benjamin Braddock, a recent college graduate who has an affair with Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father's law partner. It was Hoffman's first major role; he received an Academy Award nomination for it, but lost to Rod Steiger for \"In the Heat of the Night\".\nAlthough \"Life\" magazine joked that \"if Dustin Hoffman's face were his fortune, he'd be committed to a life of poverty\", \"The Graduate\" was a gigantic box office hit for Embassy Pictures, making Hoffman a major new star at the same time. The film received near-unanimous good reviews. \"Time\" magazine called Hoffman \"a symbol of youth\" who represented \"a new breed of actors\". The film's screenwriter, Buck Henry, notes that Hoffman's character made conventional good looks no longer necessary on screen, \"A whole generation changed its idea of what guys should look like.\u00a0... I think Dustin's physical being brought a sort of social and visual change, in the same way people first thought of Bogart. They called \"him\" ugly\". Hoffman's success amazed friends from his early years as an actor, who told him \"You were the last one I expected to make it\". Biographer Jeff Lenburg wrote that \"newspapers across the country were deluged with thousands of letters from fans\", with one example published in \"The New York Times\": \"I identified with Ben.\u00a0... I thought of him as a spiritual brother. He was confused about his future and about his place in the world, as I am. It's a film one digs, rather than understands intellectually\".\n\"Turner Classic Movies\" critic Rob Nixon notes that Hoffman represented \"a new generation of actors\". He credits Hoffman with breaking \"the mold of the traditional movie star and brought to their roles a new candor, ethnicity, and eagerness to dive deep into complex, even unlikable characters.\" Nixon expands on the significance of the film to Hoffman's career: \"In \"The Graduate\", he created a lasting resonance as Ben Braddock that made him an overnight sensation and set him on the road to becoming one of our biggest stars and most respected actors.\" Hoffman, however, mostly credits director Mike Nichols for taking a great risk in giving him, a relative unknown, the starring role: \"I don't know of another instance of a director at the height of his powers who would take a chance and cast someone like me in that part. It took tremendous courage.\"\nCritic Sam Kashner observed strong similarities between Hoffman's character and that of Nichols when he previously acted with Elaine May in the comedy team of Nichols and May. \"Just close your eyes and you'll hear a Mike Nichols\u2014Elaine May routine in any number of scenes.\" Buck Henry also noticed that \"Dustin picked up all these Nichols habits, which he used in the character. Those little noises he makes are straight from Mike\", he says. After completing \"The Graduate\" Hoffman turned down most of the film roles offered to him, preferring to go back to New York and continue performing in live theater. He returned to Broadway to appear in the title role of the musical \"Jimmy Shine\". Hoffman won a Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Performance. \"I was a theater person. That's how my friends were, too, Gene Hackman and Bobby Duvall. I wasn't going to be a movie star. I wasn't going to sell out. We wanted to be really good actors. I told them, \"I'm going out to make this movie. Don't worry, I'm coming right back.\"\nHoffman was paid $20,000 for his role in \"The Graduate\", but netted just $4,000 after taxes and living expenses. After spending that money, Hoffman filed for New York State unemployment benefits, receiving $55 per week while living in a two-room apartment in the West Village of Manhattan. He was then offered the lead in \"Midnight Cowboy\" (1969), which he accepted partly to prove many critics were wrong about his acting range and the variety of characters he could portray. Peter Biskind wrote, \"it was the very contrast between his preppy character in \"The Graduate\", and Ratso Rizzo\" that appealed to Hoffman. 'I had become troubled,' recalls Hoffman, 'by the reviews that I read of \"The Graduate\", that I was not a character actor, which I like to think of myself as. It hurt me. Some of the stuff in the press was brutal.'\" Critics assumed that director Mike Nichols got lucky by finding a typical actor with average acting ability to play the part of Benjamin Braddock.\nJohn Schlesinger, who would direct \"Midnight Cowboy\" and was seeking lead actors, held that same impression. Hoffman's performance as a button-down college graduate and track star was so convincing to Schlesinger, \"he seemed unable to comprehend the fact that he was acting\", notes Biskind. To help the director, whom he had never met, overcome that false impression, Hoffman met him in Times Square dressed as a homeless person, wearing a dirty raincoat, his hair slicked back and with an unshaven face. Schlesinger was sold, admitting, \"I've only seen you in the context of \"The Graduate\", but you'll do quite well.\" \"Midnight Cowboy\" premiered in theaters across the United States in May 1969. For his acting, Hoffman received his second Oscar nomination and the film won Best Picture. In 1994 the film was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. Biskind considers Hoffman's acting a major accomplishment:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Midnight Cowboy makes us a gift of one of the landmark performances of movie history: Dustin Hoffman's Ratso Rizzo, with Jon Voight's Joe Buck a close second. From a cesspool of dark, foul, even taboo material,\u00a0... it rescues a true humanism that need not hide its name.\nAlso in 1969, Hoffman co-starred with Mia Farrow in the Peter Yates's romantic drama film \"John and Mary\". He received a 1970 British Academy Film Award for Best Actor for his performance in the film, although the film received mixed reviews. He was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy Motion Picture The film was made soon after the success of Farrow's performance in Roman Polanski's \"Rosemary's Baby\" (1968), and Hoffman's performance in \"The Graduate\", which prompted their being hailed on the cover of the February 27, 1969, \"Time\" magazine as stars of their generation.\n1970\u20131979: Film stardom and acclaim.\nThis was followed by his role in \"Little Big Man\" (1970), where Jack Crabb, his character, ages from teenager to a 121-year-old man. The film was widely praised by critics, but was overlooked for an award except for a supporting nomination for Chief Dan George. Hoffman continued to appear in major films over the next few years. \"Who Is Harry Kellerman and Why Is He Saying Those Terrible Things About Me?\" (1971), \"Straw Dogs\" (also 1971), and \"Papillon\" (1973). He returned to Broadway in 1974, directing \"All Over Town\". Hoffman next starred in \"Lenny\" (1974), for which he was again nominated for Best Actor. \"Lenny\" was based on the life of stand-up comedian Lenny Bruce, who died at the age of 40, and was known for his open, free-style and critical form of comedy which integrated politics, religion, sex, and vulgarity. Expectations were high that Hoffman would win an Oscar for his portrayal, especially after his similar role in \"Midnight Cowboy\". Film critic Katharine Lowry speculates that director Bob Fosse \"never gave him a chance\" to go far enough into developing the character. \"We never understand what, besides the drugs he injected, made him tick like a time bomb\", she says.\nHowever, notes author Paul Gardner, \"directing \"Lenny\", his most ambitious project, exhausted Fosse emotionally and physically. It turned his life inside out\", with shooting days often lasting 10 to 12 hours: \"The Lenny Bruce project, based on Julian Barry's play, had gone through two studios and three scripts, and was a problem child, like Lenny himself. But Fosse wanted to do it, and he wanted Dustin Hoffman\". Hoffman initially turned the part down, saying: \"I didn't think the script was strong enough and I wasn't sure I was the one to play the role.\" While considering the part, he read Lenny Bruce's autobiography and looked at films with Bruce performing stand-up to live audiences. In the same interview with \"Playboy\" he recounted: \"I began to feel an affinity with him, a realization that there was a lot of Lenny Bruce in me. My wife felt it too\u00a0... I realized that I'd have to make use of my own spontaneity because he was so spontaneous. And I admired his guts\u00a0... That intimacy is what an actor tries to get\u00a0... It occurred to me that if I had known him, I would have wanted us to be friends\u00a0... and he was a provocateur, and I love to provoke.\" Movie critic Judith Crist gave Hoffman credit for the ultimate success of the film:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What is important is that Bruce's routines are so artfully reconstructed, the juice of his creativity so carefully strained, that the claim to genius is justified. And for that Dustin Hoffman deserves full credit, vanishing into the Bruce persona to simply stunning effectiveness,\u2026 Hoffman captures the restlessness, the velocity of a man's mouth straining to keep pace with a jet-propelled intelligence\u2026\n\"Lenny\" was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Cinematography.\n\"All the President's Men\" (1976) was made less than two years after the Watergate scandal, and starred Hoffman and Robert Redford as the real-life journalists, Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, respectively. Based on actual events, Hoffman and Redford play \"Washington Post\" reporters who uncover a break-in at the Watergate Hotel and end up investigating a political scandal that reaches all the way to the presidency. The film, as earlier ones, had Hoffman take on a dramatically different character than his previous one (as Lenny Bruce), although both men, Bruce and Bernstein, set their faces against abuses of institutional power, and the tendency for society to ignore such abuses. Author James Morrison compares the two roles: \"As Lenny Bruce in \"Lenny\" (1974), Hoffman plays a martyr to the cause of establishment oppression, while in \"All the President's Men\", he plays a reporter exposing presidential malfeasance.\"\nVincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" described the film as \"a spellbinding detective story\". \"The strength of the movie\", he added, was \"the virtually day-to-day record of the way Bernstein and Woodward conducted their investigations.\" The characters portrayed by Hoffman and Redford shared the rank of No. 27 Hero on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains list, while \"Entertainment Weekly\" ranked \"All the President's Men\" as one of the 25 \"Powerful Political Thrillers\".\nHoffman next starred in \"Marathon Man\" (1976), a film based on William Goldman's novel of the same name, opposite Laurence Olivier and Roy Scheider. Its director, John Schlesinger also directed Hoffman in \"Midnight Cowboy\" in 1969. Described as \"Schlesinger's thriller\", by author Gene D. Phillips, Hoffman plays the hero, Babe Levy, a part-time long-distance runner and graduate student, who suddenly finds himself being pursued by a fugitive Nazi. To put himself in the mindset of someone under severe emotional distress, Hoffman did not sleep for days at a time and let his body become disheveled and unhealthy. Olivier was alarmed when Hoffman turned up on set for the dental torture scene. Hoffman explained what he had done, and Olivier replied: \"My dear boy, have you ever tried simply acting? It's much easier.\"\nGoldman describes his inspiration for the novel: \"What if someone close to you was something totally different from what you thought? In the story, Hoffman thinks his brother (Roy Scheider) is a businessman where the reality is that the man is a spy, who has been involved with the Nazi, Szell.\" However, Hoffman remembers a serious disagreement he had with Goldman, who also wrote the screenplay, about how the story ends:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I was called on, as the character, to fire point-blank at the Laurence Olivier character, Dr. Szell, and kill him in that last scene. And I said that I couldn't do it. Goldman was quite upset about it, because first of all, how dare I? He wrote the book. \"Your job isn't to rewrite \u2014 your job is to play it as written.\"\u00a0... it got nasty. I said, \"Go hire someone else.\"\nI remember Goldman saying: \"Why can't you do this? Are you such a Jew?\" I said, \"No, but I won't play a Jew who cold-bloodedly kills another human being.\"\u00a0... And that's important to me, that I didn't shoot him in the end. Being a Jew is not losing your humanity and not losing your soul.\nHoffman's next roles were also successful. He opted out of directing \"Straight Time\" (1978), but starred as a thief. His next film, Michael Apted's \"Agatha\" (1979), was with Vanessa Redgrave as Agatha Christie, focussing on the missing eleven days of the author's life. The part of Archie Christie was played by Timothy Dalton, then partner of Vanessa Redgrave, and later to star in James Bond movies. Dalton's depiction of cold indifference to his wife produced a perfect foil to Hoffman's portrayal of warm compassion, humor and sensitivity. The film had both romantic and comic moments whilst the overall plot cleverly mirrored one of Christie's detective novels. \"Agatha\" was generally very well received by critics, especially in the UK, and maintains an 82% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\nHoffman next starred in \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" (1979) co-starring Meryl Streep and directed by Robert Benton. The film tells the story of a married couple's divorce and its impact on everyone involved, including the couple's young son. Hoffman won his first Academy Award, and the film also received the Best Picture honor, plus the awards for Best Supporting Actress (Streep), Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay. The film required Hoffman to change his attitude, from being a \"desensitized advertising art director\" into becoming a \"responsive and concerned daddy\" after his wife (Streep) walks out on him and their six-year-old son, Billy. Hoffman, during the making of the movie, was also going through his own divorce after a ten-year first marriage. Hoffman has said, \"Giving myself permission not only to be present but to be a father was a kind of epiphany for me at that time, that I could get to through my work.\u00a0... I got closer to being a father by playing a father. That's very painful to say.\" The role also reminded him of his own love of children in general saying, \"Children are more interesting than anything. I walk my younger child to school every day and I don't like leaving the school. I would like to sit down on those little chairs, at those little tables, and play. And a child's love is like a drug. To have a child throw his arms about you\u2014it's instant stoned. People talk about the rush heroin gives you: I would say children give you that rush\".\nBenton's directing has been praised by Hoffman, who credits him for inspiring the emotional level supporting many scenes: \"Perfect directors make you emotional. On \"Kramer vs. Kramer\", Robert Benton made me emotional. He was pulling so hard for me. When I didn't think I could do a scene again I'd say, \"I can't give it to you, I haven't got it.\" Then he'd just get this look on his face and roll the camera and I'd say, \"Okay, this is yours.\" That's what he made you want to do for him\u2014to give him one.\"\n1980\u20131989: Career expansion.\nIn \"Tootsie\" (1982), Hoffman portrays Michael Dorsey, a struggling actor who finds himself dressing up as a woman to land a role on a soap opera. His co-star was Jessica Lange. \"Tootsie\" earned ten Academy Award nominations, including Hoffman's fifth nomination. Under direction by Sydney Pollack, Hoffman's role demanded \"a steady bombardment of opposites\u2014edgy then funny, romantic then realistic, soft then quivering.\" To film critic David Denby, Hoffman's character \"embodies vulnerability and drive in perfect proportion. He has the knack of making everything he does seem perilous, and so audiences feel protective of him and root for him.\" Hoffman's acting was made more difficult than necessary, however, as he was not given the rehearsal time Pollack promised, \"I like to be very prepared, and I feel that the success or failure of a film is many times determined before you start principal photography. I wanted rehearsal very much. I was promised two weeks and was grieved that I didn't get it. We also followed the risky course of starting to shoot with a screenplay that wasn't completed\".\nFellow actor Gary Oldman reported that, during a telephone conversation with Hoffman, the latter recalled having made comments toward a \"very powerful\" industry figure who ensured that he was unable to find work in Hollywood for some time following \"Tootsie\". In 1983, Hoffman became a Major Donor for The Mirror Theater Ltd, alongside Paul Newman and Al Pacino, matching a grant from Laurance Rockefeller. The men were inspired to invest by their connection with Lee Strasberg, as Lee's then daughter-in-law Sabra Jones was the Founder and Producing Artistic Director of The Mirror.\nIn 1983, Hoffman signed on to star in \"The Yellow Jersey\", which was to be a bicycle-racing drama set during the Tour de France. Hoffman was passionate about the project, considering several directors, firstly Michael Cimino whom he later fired due to the director's uncompromising way of working. The film's producers, however, failed to find a suitable replacement, so the film was not made.\nIn 1984, Hoffman starred as Willy Loman in the Broadway revival of Arthur Miller's play \"Death of a Salesman\". He reprised his role in a TV movie of the same name, for which he won the 1985 Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor along with a Golden Globe. Hoffman first read the play at the age of 16, but today considers the story much like his own: \"It was a blueprint of my family. I was the loser, the flunky, and my brother, a high-school varsity football player, was Biff.\" Author Marie Brenner notes that Hoffman \"has been obsessed with the play\" throughout his career: \"For years he has wanted to be Willy Loman; when he discovered that Arthur Miller was his neighbor in Connecticut, they began to talk about it in earnest.\" For Hoffman, the story also left a deep emotional impact from the time he first read it, \"I read that play, and I was just destroyed by it. It was like finding out something terrible about my family. I just shook. I felt like my family's privacy had been invaded. I couldn't even talk about it for weeks\". Hoffman rehearsed for three weeks with the play's original star, Lee J. Cobb, and remembers seeing his stage performance: \"I'll never forget that period in my life. It was so vivid, so intense, watching Lee J. Cobb and his sixteen-inch guns as Willy. God, how I think about what I saw on that stage!\" Brenner adds that Hoffman \"has been training like a boxer for the role that so exhausted Cobb he had to be replaced after four months.\" The original play was directed by Elia Kazan, who Hoffman considers \"the perfect director, the best there ever was.\u00a0... God, I would have done \"anything\" to have worked with Kazan.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n The thing I love about \"Ishtar\" \u2013 and I love it with all of its flaws \u2013 is that it has a statement to make. And that is: It is far, far better to spend a life being second rate in something that you're passionate about, than to spend a life being first-rate at that which you are not passionate about. I thought that was worth making a movie about. These guys want to be Simon &amp; Garfunkel, but they have no talent at all. They're middle-aged guys, and at the end of the movie they wind up singing \"That's Amore\" at a Holiday Inn in Morocco. It's fair. It's fair to make a movie about that.\n\u2014Hoffman on working on \"Ishtar\"\nHoffman's worst film failure was Elaine May's \"Ishtar\" (1987), co-starring Warren Beatty, who also produced it. Hoffman and Beatty play two down-and-out singer-songwriters who travel to Morocco for a nightclub gig and get caught up in foreign intrigue. Much of the movie was filmed in Africa. The film faced severe production problems, mostly related to its $55\u00a0million cost, and received overwhelmingly negative reviews. However, Hoffman and Beatty liked the film's final cut and tried to defend it. Hoffman and Beatty were unaffected by the flop, and \"Ishtar\" became a cult film. Quentin Tarantino, for one, has called it one of his favorite movies, partly due to the humorous lyrics of the songs written by Paul Williams.\nNext came director Barry Levinson's \"Rain Man\" (1988), where Hoffman starred as an autistic savant, opposite Tom Cruise. Levinson, Hoffman and Cruise worked for two years on the film, and Hoffman's performance gained him his second Academy Award. Behind Hoffman's motivation for doing the film, he has said, \"Deep inside, \"Rain Man\" is about how autistic we all are.\" In preparation for the part, Hoffman spent two years befriending autistic people, which included taking them bowling and to fast food restaurants. \"It fed my obsession\", he has stated. Hoffman worked at the New York Psychiatric Institute, affiliated with Columbia University, when he was 21. \"It was a great experience for me\", he said. \"All my life I had wanted to get inside a prison or a mental hospital.\u00a0... I wanted to get inside where behavior, human behavior, was so exposed. All the things the rest of us were feeling and stopping up were coming out of these people.\" He used that experience to help him develop the character of Raymond Babbitt, a high-functioning autistic savant, yet a person who critic David Denby described as \"a strangely shuttered genius\". Hoffman created certain character traits for Raymond. Denby noted: \"Hoffman, looking suddenly older and smaller, has developed a small shuffling walk for Raymond, with shoulder bent. His eyes don't make contact with anyone else's, and he flattens his voice to a dry nasal bark.\"\n\"Rain Man\" won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor for Hoffman, and Best Director for Barry Levinson. Having worked closely with Hoffman for two years on filming, Levinson offered some opinions about his skill as an actor:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;You can't define Dustin Hoffman, because he's unique. He's one of a kind and he's not one character. There is no Dustin Hoffman. He is many, many people.\u00a0... He can do comedy and he can do drama. He has an enormous range, and yet he's still Dustin somewhere in there. He's intelligent and has a great sense of how to connect with people, because he's very interesting. On a day-to-day basis, he's like an actor who's making his first movie, with the enthusiasm and energy to want to make things happen and try things and experiment.\nAfter \"Rain Man\", Hoffman appeared with Sean Connery and Matthew Broderick in \"Family Business\" (1989), directed by Sidney Lumet. The story centers on the estrangement between Vito (Hoffman), a middle-aged man trying to succeed in a legitimate business, and his \"hopelessly corrupt but charming father\", Jesse (Connery). Critics were mostly not impressed with the story, although the individual performances were praised, especially Connery's.\nBecause of their different acting styles and nationalities, some industry writers thought Connery and Hoffman might not work well together as close family members. \"To the surprise of many\", note Connery biographers Lee Pfeiffer and Lisa Philip, \"the two superstars developed an immediate rapport and chemistry that translates onto the screen.\" And Lumet remembered: \"Sean is extremely disciplined and Dustin is very improvisational, all over the place with his lines. I didn't know where it would end up, but Sean met Dustin improvisation for improvisation, and a great deal of richness and humor came out of it.\"\n1990\u20131999: Established actor.\nIn 1991, Hoffman voiced substitute teacher Mr. Bergstrom in \"The Simpsons\" episode \"Lisa's Substitute\". He was credited under the pseudonym Sam Etic, a play on \"Semitic\". Throughout the 1990s, Hoffman appeared in many large, studio films, such as \"Dick Tracy\" (1990) (where his \"Ishtar\" co-star Beatty plays the titular character), \"Hero\" (1992) and \"Billy Bathgate\" (1991) co-starring with Nicole Kidman (who was nominated for a Golden Globe). Hoffman also played the title role of Captain Hook in Steven Spielberg's \"Hook\" (also 1991), earning a Golden Globe nomination, and the narrator in Dr. Seuss Video Classics: \"Horton Hears a Who!\" (also 1992); in \"Hook\", Hoffman's costume was so heavy that he had to wear an air-conditioned suit under it. Hoffman played the lead role in \"Outbreak\" (1995), alongside Rene Russo, Kevin Spacey, Morgan Freeman, Cuba Gooding Jr. and Donald Sutherland. In the film, Hoffman is a medical doctor, serving as a Colonel in the U.S. Army Medical Corps., working at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), who uncovers a newly discovered Ebola-like virus which came to the U.S. from Africa in an infected monkey. Hoffman races to stop the virus's spread and find a vaccine before it becomes a worldwide pandemic with no cure. It was one of the films that was produced by his production banner, Punch Productions.\nThe movie is described by critic Roger Ebert as \"one of the great scare stories of our time, the notion that deep in the uncharted rain forests, deadly diseases are lurking, and if they ever escape their jungle homes and enter the human bloodstream, there will be a new plague the likes of which we have never seen.\" Critic David Denby credits Hoffman with giving the movie much of its thriller-like quality:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Tanks and men pour in to herd the terrified population here and there, and Dustin Hoffman, as the supersleuth Army doctor, gives such a lip-biting, anguished performance he absolves the movie of slickness. Hoffman isn't good, exactly; he's tense, edgy, and righteous, like a B-movie actor from the fifties.\nFollowing that, he appeared in the 1996 revenge drama/legal thriller \"Sleepers\" (1996) with Robert De Niro, Brad Pitt, Jason Patric, and Kevin Bacon. In the mid-1990s, Hoffman starred in\u2014and was deeply involved in the production of\u2014David Mamet's \"American Buffalo\" (also 1996), and an early effort of film editor Kate Sanford. In 1997, Hoffman starred opposite John Travolta in the Costa Gavras film \"Mad City\". Hoffman gained his seventh Academy Award nomination for his performance in \"Wag The Dog\" (1997), in a role that allowed Hoffman the chance to work with both Robert De Niro and Denis Leary. The movie is a black comedy film produced and directed by Barry Levinson, who also directed Hoffman in \"Rain Man\" in 1988. The story takes place a few days before a presidential election, where a Washington, D.C. spin doctor (De Niro) distracts the electorate from a sex scandal by hiring a Hollywood film producer (Hoffman) to construct a fake war with Albania. Hoffman, as a caricature of real life producer Robert Evans, according to some, \"gives the kind of wonderfully funny performance that is liable to win prizes, especially since its mixture of affection and murderous parody is so precise. Stanley (Hoffman) conducts business meetings in tennis clothes or in robe and slippers\", notes critic Janet Maslin.\nHe next appeared in another Barry Levinson film, the science fiction psychological thriller, \"Sphere\" (1998), opposite Sharon Stone. In 1999, Hoffman received the AFI Life Achievement Award and recalls the emotional impact that receiving the award had on him, \"There was this reel of pictures, me playing all these different roles. I had my first\u2014and only, thank God\u2014panic attack. What followed was depression.\u00a0... It had to do with a central core in me, which was that I never felt I deserved success\". Hoffman next appeared in \"Moonlight Mile\" (2002), followed by \"Confidence\" (2003) opposite Edward Burns, Andy Garc\u00eda and Rachel Weisz. Hoffman finally had a chance to work with Gene Hackman in Gary Fleder's \"Runaway Jury\" (also 2003), an adaptation of John Grisham's bestselling novel. Hoffman played theater owner Charles Frohman in the J. M. Barrie historical fantasia \"Finding Neverland\" (2004), costarring Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet. In director David O. Russell's \"I Heart Huckabees\" (also 2004), Hoffman appeared opposite Lily Tomlin as an existential detective team member. In 2001, his Punch Productions company went to a first look deal with The Walt Disney Studios.\nSeven years after his nomination for \"Wag the Dog\", Hoffman got another opportunity to perform again with Robert De Niro, co-starring with Streisand and Ben Stiller in the 2004 comedy \"Meet the Fockers\", a sequel to \"Meet the Parents\" (2000). Hoffman won the 2005 MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance. In 2005, he voiced a horse in \"Racing Stripes\", and appeared in cameo roles in Andy Garc\u00eda's \"The Lost City\" and on the final episode of HBO sitcom \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\"'s fifth season. Hoffman appeared in \"Stranger than Fiction\" (2006), played the perfumer Giuseppe Baldini in Tom Tykwer's film \"\" (also 2006). In 2007, he was featured in an advertising campaign for Australian telecommunications company Telstra's Next G network, appeared in the 50 Cent video \"Follow My Lead\" as a psychiatrist, and played the title character in the British family film \"Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium\" for which he was nominated for a BIFA for Best Performance by an Actor in a British Independent Film at the British Independent Film Awards 2007. In 2008, although he was reluctant to perform in an animated feature film (despite previously performing voices in a version of \"The Point!\" and in an episode of \"The Simpsons\"), Hoffman had a prominent role as Shifu in the film \"Kung Fu Panda\", which was praised in part for his comedic chemistry with Jack Black (whom he tutored in acting for an important scene) and his character's poignantly complex relationship with the story's villain. He later won the Annie Award for Voice Acting in an Animated Feature for his performance and has continued into the role in the franchise's subsequent filmed productions outside of the franchise's . He next voiced Roscuro in \"The Tale of Despereaux\".\nAs the title character in \"Last Chance Harvey\", Hoffman acted with co-star Emma Thompson in the story of two lonely people who tentatively forge a relationship over the course of three days. Director Joel Hopkins notes that Hoffman was a perfectionist and self-critical: \"He often wanted to try things stripped down, because less is sometimes more. He worries about every little detail.\"\n2010\u2013present.\nHe appears in \"Little Fockers\", the critically panned yet financially successful 2010 sequel to \"Meet the Fockers\". However, his character plays a significantly smaller role than in the previous installment. In 2011, Hoffman reprised his role as Master Shifu in the commercially and critically successful animated film \"Kung Fu Panda 2\". In 2012, Hoffman's audiobook recording of Jerzy Kosinski's \"Being There\" was released at Audible.com. Hoffman starred in the HBO horse racing drama \"Luck\", as a man involved in bookmaking and casino operations. \"Luck\" was canceled in March 2012 after three horses died on set.\nIn 2012, Hoffman made his directorial debut with \"Quartet\", starring Maggie Smith, Tom Courtenay, Pauline Collins, Billy Connolly, and Michael Gambon. The BBC comedy-drama premiered at the 2012 Toronto Film Festival where it earned respectable reviews from critics. Smith was nominated for Golden Globe for her performance. In 2015, Hoffman starred in \"Roald Dahl's Esio Trot\", a BBC television film adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic novel, adapted by Richard Curtis and co-starring Judi Dench. Hoffman received an Emmy Award for Best Performance by an Actor. In 2016, he once again lent his voice to Master Shifu in the animated feature \"Kung Fu Panda 3\".\nIn 2017, Hoffman starred in Noah Baumbach's Netflix film \"The Meyerowitz Stories\" alongside Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Elizabeth Marvel and Emma Thompson. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 21, 2017, where it received a four-minute standing ovation. In 2017, Hoffman was honored with the Gotham Awards Tribute alongside Sofia Coppola, Nicole Kidman, Edward Lachman. Hoffman was introduced by Elizabeth Marvel.\nIn 2020, it was announced that Hoffman would make his return to the Broadway stage in Scott Rudin's revival of \"Our Town\" as the Stage Manager. Hoffman's last appearance on stage was 30 years prior in \"The Merchant of Venice\" in 1989. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Broadway theaters remained shut until 2021. Hoffman appeared alongside Candice Bergen, Dianna Agron and Simon Helberg in \"As They Made Us\" directed by Mayim Bialik. He also starred alongside Sissy Spacek and his son Jake Hoffman in Darren Le Gallo's directorial film debut \"Sam &amp; Kate\" which began filming in February 2022. In September 2021, he was attached to feature comedy film \"Mr. Shaw Goes To Hollywood\" as MGM studio head, Louis B Mayer. Filming would tentatively commence fall 2021.\nIn October 2022, Hoffman was cast in Francis Ford Coppola's latest film, a dystopian science fiction epic \"Megalopolis\". The film reunited Hoffman with his \"Midnight Cowboy\" costar Jon Voight. The film premiered at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival. Hoffman is attached to Peter Greenaway's upcoming film \"Lucca Mortis\", which has started filming in the Tuscan city of Lucca. Most recently, he has reprised his role as Master Shifu in \"Kung Fu Panda 4\" (2024).\nStyle and reception.\nDavid Thomson of \"The Guardian\" described of Hoffman as a central figure of the late 60s, 70s and 80s\" adding, \"He is a part of what has turned out a very ambiguous vintage: it also includes Jack Nicholson, Robert Redford, Warren Beatty and Woody Allen, actors who cannot quite make up their minds whether they are adorable still or national treasures.\"\nIn 2017, the Gotham Awards announced that they would recognize Hoffman for his lifetime achievement in film. The director of the Independent Filmmaker Project (IFP) and Made in NY Media Center stated, \"We are thrilled to present Dustin Hoffman with the Actor Tribute. Starting with his breakthrough role in the timeless classic \"The Graduate\" to his highly praised turn in his upcoming film, \"The Meyerowitz Stories\", Dustin's wide range of roles \u2013 often portraying antiheroes or the marginalized \u2013 and the creative choices he has embodied in these complex characters, has firmly placed him amongst the most compelling actors to have graced the screen.\"\nActress Elizabeth Marvel introduced Hoffman where she talked about the influence he has had over her career and stated, \"His work is never anything less than extraordinary\".\nActing credits and accolades.\nIn 1999, Hoffman was honored by the American Film Institute, who celebrated him with the 27th Life Achievement Award. Those who praised him and celebrated his work included Edward Norton, Jon Voight, Goldie Hawn, Cuba Gooding Jr., and Kathy Bates. Jack Nicholson presented Hoffman with the award. Upon receiving the award he quoted the poet Emily Dickinson, \"Not knowing when the dawn will come, I open the door\".\nIn 2009, Hoffman received an Honorary Cesar Medal at the C\u00e9sar Awards. In 2012, Dustin Hoffman received Kennedy Center Honors, with the following commendation: \"Dustin Hoffman's unyielding commitment to the wide variety of roles he plays has made him one of the most versatile and iconoclastic actors of this or any other generation\". Those who honored him at the ceremony included Robert De Niro, Liev Schreiber, Naomi Watts, and Billy Connolly.\nPersonal life.\nMarriage and relationships.\nAfter meeting in 1963, Hoffman married Anne Byrne in May 1969. He adopted Karina (born 1967), Byrne's child from a previous marriage, and with Byrne had daughter Jenna (born October 15, 1969). In 1970, Hoffman and Byrne were living in Greenwich Village in a building next door to a townhouse occupied at the time by members of the Weathermen, when a bomb was accidentally detonated in the townhouse's basement, killing three. In the 2002 documentary \"The Weather Underground\", Hoffman can be seen standing in the street during the aftermath of the explosion. The couple divorced in 1980.\nAfter Hoffman's separation, he began seeing Lisa Gottsegen, their families having had a relationship together growing up. She was finishing her Juris Doctor degree, and the couple married on October 12, 1980. They have four children: Jacob Edward (born March 22, 1981), Rebecca Lillian (born March 17, 1983), Maxwell Geoffrey (born August 30, 1984) and Alexandra Lydia \"Ali\" (born October 27, 1987). Hoffman has a few grandchildren as of 2024.\nIn an interview, he said that all of his children from his second marriage had bar or bat mitzvahs and that he is a more observant Jew now than when he was younger. He has also lamented that he is not fluent in Hebrew.\nPolitical activism.\nHoffman has long supported the Democratic Party and Ralph Nader. In 1997 he was one of a number of Hollywood stars and executives to sign an open letter to the German chancellor Helmut Kohl protesting against the treatment of Scientologists in Germany, which was published as a newspaper advertisement in the \"International Herald Tribune\".\nCancer treatment.\nHoffman was successfully treated for cancer in 2013.\nSexual misconduct allegations.\nIn 2017, seven women accused Hoffman of sexual misconduct or assault. Anna Graham Hunter alleged that, while she was 17 and working as an intern on a TV production of \"Death of a Salesman\", Hoffman made inappropriate jokes and comments around her and asked her to give him foot massages. Hoffman released an apology to Hunter, saying \"I have the utmost respect for women and feel terrible that anything I might have done could have put her in an uncomfortable situation\", continuing, \"I am sorry. It is not reflective of who I am.\" Online magazine \"Slate\" reported in 2017 that Meryl Streep had differences with Hoffman which include him slapping her in a scene and him groping her breast. However, a representative for Meryl Streep responded to \"Slate\" saying it was not an accurate rendering of their 1979 meeting. Streep's representative stated \"there was an offense and it is something for which Dustin apologized. And Meryl accepted that.\"\nIn December 2017, comedian John Oliver unexpectedly questioned Hoffman about the allegations during the 20th anniversary screening of \"Wag the Dog\" at the 92nd Street Y. \"It's 'not reflective of who I am' \u2013 it's that kind of response to this stuff that pisses me off,\" Oliver said. \"Do you understand how that feels like a dismissal?\" Hoffman said he felt blindsided by the line of questioning, remarking \"You've made the case better than anyone else can. I'm guilty. Because someone has alleged something, I'm guilty. You push a button. It's all over the world: I'm a predator. I'm this and that, and it's not true.\" Hoffman has not publicly responded to the other six allegations.\nBill Murray, who costarred with Hoffman in \"Tootsie\" (1982) and \"The Lost City\" (2005), defended him, saying, \"I heard what happened to him, and Dustin Hoffman is a really decent person. He's crazy, a Borscht Belt flirt, has been his whole life. (But) he's a really sweet man.\" Actors \nChevy Chase and Liam Neeson also came to his defense.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "42152", "revid": "41840956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42152", "title": "Parashurama", "text": "Sixth avatar of Hindu god Vishnu\nParashurama (), also referred to as Rama Jamadagnya, Rama Bhargava and Virarama, is the sixth avatar among the Dashavatara of the preserver god Vishnu in Hinduism. Hindu tradition holds him to be the destroyer of evil on Earth. He liberates the Mother Earth from felons, ill-behaved men, extremists, demons and those blind with pride. He is described as one of the \"Chiranjivi\" (Immortals), who will appear at the end of the \"Kali Yuga\" to be the guru of Vishnu's tenth and last incarnation, Kalki.\nBorn to Jamadagni and Renuka, the Brahmin Parashurama was foretold to appear at a time when overwhelming evil prevailed on the earth. The Kshatriya caste, with weapons and power, had begun to abuse their power, take what belonged to others by force, and tyrannise people. He corrected the cosmic equilibrium by destroying these Kshatriyas twenty-one times (leaving some lineages). He is married to Dharani, an incarnation of Lakshmi, the wife of Vishnu.\nIn the epic \"Ramayana\", he arrives after Sita Swayamvara, upon hearing the loud noise when Rama uplifts and breaks the divine bow Pinaka. He later deduces that Rama is Vishnu himself, he himself asked Rama to destroy the fruits of his austerities. \nIn the Mahabharata, Parashurama, the formidable warrior-sage and sixth avatar of Vishnu, is renowned for his unparalleled martial prowess. While the epic does not explicitly state the exact number of days Parashurama would have taken to conclude the Kurukshetra war, his legendary feats suggest that he could have ended it swiftly.\nGiven these accounts, it's widely believed in various retellings and interpretations of the Mahabharata that Parashurama possessed the capability to end the Kurukshetra war in a single day. However, he chose not to participate in the battle, adhering to his vow of renunciation and neutrality.\nIn the epic \"Mahabharata\" he was the guru of Bhisma, Drona, Rukmi and Karna.\nParashurama is said to carry various traits including courage, aggression, and warfare along with serenity, patience and prudence. He was known to show his benevolence to Brahmins, children, women, old men and other weaker sections of the society.\nLegend.\nAccording to Hindu history, Parashurama was born to the sage Jamadagni and his Kshatriya wife, Renuka. In local tradition, it is believed they lived in a hut located at Janapav. They had a celestial cow called Surabhi, which gives them all that they desire. A king named Kartavirya Arjuna (not to be confused with Arjuna, the Pandava) learns about this cow of plenty and wants it. He asks Jamadagni to give it to him, but the sage refuses. While Parashurama is away from the hut, the king takes it by force. When Jamadagni pleads his case and seeks for the return of the cow, the king strikes him with his fist, killing him. Parashurama learns about this crime, and is upset. With his axe in his hand, he challenges the king to battle. They fight, and Parashurama defeats and kills the king, according to the \"Padma Purana\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The wicked-minded one lost his valour due to his own sin. The mighty son of Re\u1e47uk\u0101, being angry, cut off his head, as mighty Indra did the peak of a big mountain, and he who was brave and angry, killed Sahasrab\u0101hu and all the kings with his axe in the battle. Seeing R\u0101ma, the very fearful one, all kings on the earth, struck by fear, ran away as elephants do on seeing a lion. The angry R\u0101ma killed the kings even though they had fled due to the resentment against his father's murder, as the angry Garu\u1e0da killed the serpents. The valorous R\u0101ma made the entire [world] clear of the k\u1e63atriyas, but protected [i.e. spared] only the very great family of Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku, due to its being the family to which his maternal grandfather was related, and due to his mother's words.\u2014\u200a\nThe warrior class challenges him, and he slays every single member of the class, save for those belonging to the lineages of Manu and Ikshvaku. The mighty son of Jamadagni, having rid the world of the Kshatriyas, then performs the ashvamedha sacrifice. He grants the earth with the seven islands to principal rishis belonging to the Brahmin class. Having renounced the earth and his violent deeds, he retires to the hermitage of Nara-Narayana to engage in penance. The legend likely has roots in the ancient conflict between the Brahmin varna, with knowledge duties, and the Kshatriya varna, with warrior and enforcement roles.\nEpic Ramayana.\nIn the \"Ramayana\", following Rama's wedding to Sita at Mithila and during their homeward journey to Ayodhya, his party comes across a number of inauspicious signs. Amid an earthquake and a dust storm, Parashurama appears before the party. After accepting the libation offered to him, Parashurama challenges Rama to combat, on the condition that the prince show his strength to the sage by placing a bow within the string of the latter's bow, Sharanga, and discharging it. Ignoring Dasharatha's plea to spare Rama this task, Parashurama relays the divine origin of the bow and the history of its ownership, appealing to Rama's skills as a warrior. Rama seizes the bow from Parashurama and strings it, an act that causes the latter to become bereft of his divine power. Humbled, Parashurama acknowledges that Rama is an incarnation of Vishnu and requests the prince to allow him to return to the mountain Mahendra so that he could practice yoga and accrue merit. After circumambulating Rama in worship, Parashurama returns to his hermitage.\nEpic Mahabharata.\nBhishma.\nIn the \"Mahabharata\", Parashurama intercedes on the princess Amba's behalf, promising to command his disciple Bhishma to do his duty and marry her after her abduction. When Parashurama arrives with his retinue at Kurukshetra, he sends a message to Bhishma to inform him of his arrival. Bhishma comes to see his guru, offering him the traditional respects. Parashurama commands Bhishma to accept Amba as his wife. Bhishma refuses, restating that he had taken a vow of celibacy. An infuriated Parashurama threatens Bhishma with death. Bhishma tries to calm the sage, but in vain, and he finally agrees to battle his guru to safeguard his Kshatriya duty. Ganga tries stopping the battle by beseeching her son as well as the great sage, but fails. The great battle lasts for 23 days, without any result. On the 24th day, when Bhishma chooses to use a deadly weapon, at the behest of the divine sage Narada and the devas, Parashurama ends the conflict and the battle is declared a draw. Parashurama narrates the events to Amba and urges her to seek Bhishma's protection. However, Amba refuses to listen to Parashurama's advice and angrily declares that she would achieve her objective by asceticism.\nParshuram Kshetra.\nThere are legends dealing with the origins of the western coast geographically and culturally. One such legend is the retrieval of the west coast from the sea, by Parashurama. It proclaims that Parashurama, an incarnation of Mahavishnu, threw his battle axe into the sea. As a result, the land of the western coast arose, and thus was reclaimed from the waters. The place from which he threw his axe (or shot an arrow) is on Salher fort (the second highest peak and the highest fort in Maharashtra) in the Baglan taluka of Nashik district of Maharashtra. There is a temple on the summit of this fort dedicated to Parshuram and there are footprints in the rock four times the size of normal humans. This fort on a lower plateau has a temple of goddess Renuka, Parshuram's mother and also a Yagya Kunda with pits for poles to erect a shamiyana on the banks of a big water tank.\nAccording to the Sangam classic \"Purananuru\", the Chera king Senkuttuvan conquered the lands between Kanyakumari and the Himalayas. Lacking worthy enemies, he besieged the sea by throwing his spear into it. According to the 17th-century Malayalam work \"Keralolpathi\", the lands of Kerala were recovered from the sea by the axe-wielding warrior sage Parashurama, the sixth incarnation of Vishnu (hence, Kerala is also called \"Parashurama Kshetram\" 'The Land of Parashurama'). Parashurama threw his axe across the sea, and the water receded as far as it reached. According to legend, this new area of land extended from Gokarna to Kanyakumari. The land which rose from sea was filled with salt and unsuitable for habitation; so Parashurama invoked the snake king Vasuki, who spat holy poison and converted the soil into fertile lush green land. Out of respect, Vasuki and all snakes were appointed as protectors and guardians of the land. P. T. Srinivasa Iyengar has theorised that Senguttuvan may have been inspired by the Parashurama legend, which was brought by early Aryan settlers.\nIn present-day Goa (or Gomantak), which is a part of the Konkan, there is a temple in Canacona in South Goa district dedicated to Parashurama.\nShastras.\nParashurama is generally presented as the fifth son of Renuka and Rishi Jamadagni. The legends of Parashurama appear in many Hindu texts, in different versions:\nDevi Bhagvata Purana.\nIn Chapter 6 of the \"Devi Bhagavata Purana\", he is born from the thigh with intense light surrounding him that blinds all warriors, who then repent their evil ways and promise to lead a moral life if their eyesight is restored. The boy grants them the boon.\nParashurama retired in the Mahendra Mountains, according to chapter 2.3.47 of the \"Bhagavata Purana\".\nVishnu Purana.\nIn Chapter 4 of the \"Vishnu Purana\", Rcika prepares a meal for two women, one simple, and another with ingredients that if eaten would cause the woman to conceive a son with martial powers. The latter is accidentally eaten by Renuka, and she then gives birth to Parashurama.\nVayu Purana.\nIn Chapter 2 of the \"Vayu Purana\", he is born after his mother Renuka eats a sacrificial offering made to both Rudra (Shiva) and Vishnu, which gives him dual characteristics of Kshatriya and Brahmin.\nMahabharata.\nParashurama is described in some versions of the \"Mahabharata\" as the angry Brahmin who with his axe, killed a huge number of Kshatriya warriors because they were abusing their power. In some versions, he even kills his own mother because his father asks him to in order to test his obeisance. After Parashurama obeys his father's order to kill his mother, his father grants him a boon. Parashurama asks for the reward that his mother be brought back to life, and she is restored to life. Parashurama remains filled with sorrow after the violence, repents and expiates his sin. After his Mother comes back to life, he tries to clean the blood-stained axe but he finds a drop of blood which he was unable to clean and tries cleaning the blood drop in different rivers. This is when he moves towards the south of India in search of any holy river where he could clean his axe, finally, he reaches Tirthahalli village in Shimoga, Karnataka and tries to clean the axe and to his surprise, the axe gets cleaned in the holy river of Tunga. With respect towards the holy river, he constructs a Shiva linga and performs pooja and the temple is named as Rameshwara temple. The place where Parashurama cleaned his axe is called Ramakunda.\nHe plays important roles in the \"Mahabharata\" serving as mentor to Bhishma (chapter 5.178), Drona (chapter 1.121) and Karna (chapter 3.286), teaching weapon arts and helping key warriors in both sides of the war.\nIn the regional literature of Kerala, he is the founder of the land, the one who brought it out of the sea and settled a Hindu community there. He is also known as Rama Jamadagnya and Rama Bhargava in some Hindu texts. He is the only incarnation of Vishnu who never dies, never returns to abstract Vishnu and lives in meditative retirement. Further, he is the only incarnation of Vishnu that co-exists with other Vishnu incarnations Rama and Krishna in some versions of the \"Ramayana\" and \"Mahabharata\", respectively.\nSamanta Panchaka.\nAccording to the Sangraha Parva, after killing 21 generations of Kshatriyas, he filled their blood in five pools collectively known as the \"Samantha Panchaka\" (Sanskrit: ). He later atoned for his sin by severe penance. The five pools are considered to be holy.\nThe Anukramanika Parva says that the Samantha Panchaka is located somewhere around Kurukshetra. It also mentions that the Pandavas performed a few religious rites near the Samantha Panchaka before the Kurukshetra War.\nParashurama Kshetra.\nLegend tells that before retiring to Mahendragiri mount, Parashurama threw his axe in the Arabian Sea, and land rose out of it, called Parashurama Kshetra.\nThere is much interpretation of 'Parashurama Kshetra' (Land of Parashurama) mentioned in the Puranas.\nThe region on the western coast of India from Gokarna to Kanyakumari was known as Parashurama Kshetra.\nThe region of Konkan was also considered as Parashurama Kshetra.\nThe ancient Saptakonkana is a slightly larger region described in the Sahyadrikhanda which refers to it as Parashuramakshetra (Sanskrit for \"The Land Of Parashurama\"), Vapi to Tapi is an area of South Gujarat, India. This area is called \"Parshuram Ni Bhoomi\".\nIconography.\nThe Hindu literature on iconography such as the \"Vishnudharmottara Purana\" and \"Rupamandana\" describes him as a man with matted locks, with two hands, one carrying an axe. However, the \"Agni Purana\" portrays his iconography with four hands, carrying his axe, bow, arrow and sword. The \"Bhagavata Purana\" describes his icon as one with four hands, carrying his axe, bow, arrows and a shield like a warrior. Though a warrior, his representation inside Hindu temples with him in war scenes is rare (the Basohli temple is one such exception). Typically, he is shown with two hands, with an axe in his right hand either seated or standing.\nIn popular culture.\nThe Parashurama avatar symbolizes the strict and non-relinquishing aspect of showing \"daya\" (mercy), where he has to be harsh for the well being of the \"srushti\" (world).\nOn top of the hills of Janapav is a Shiva temple where Parashurama is believed to have worshipped Shiva, the ashram is known as Jamadagni Ashram, named after his father. The place also has a Kund (Pond) that is being developed by the state government.\nThe Bhumihar caste of eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar claim to be descendants of Parashuram. As Parashurama was a Brahmin who carried out warfare like a Kshatriya, Bhumihars thus claim the traits of both the varnas.\nIn Kannada folklore, especially in devotional songs sung by the Devdasis he is often referred to as a son of Yellamma. Parashurama legends are notable for their discussion of violence, the cycles of retaliations, the impulse of \"krodha\" (anger), the inappropriateness of \"krodha\", and repentance.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "42154", "revid": "196446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42154", "title": "Krishna", "text": "Major deity in Hinduism\nKrishna (; Sanskrit: \u0915\u0943\u0937\u094d\u0923, IAST: ) is a major deity in Hinduism. He is worshipped as the eighth avatar of Vishnu and also as the Supreme God in his own right. He is the god of protection, compassion, tenderness, and love; and is widely revered among Hindu divinities. Krishna's birthday is celebrated every year by Hindus on Krishna Janmashtami according to the lunisolar Hindu calendar, which falls in late August or early September of the Gregorian calendar.\nThe anecdotes and narratives of Krishna's life are generally titled as \"Krishna L\u012bl\u0101\". He is a central figure in the \"Mahabharata\", the \"Bhagavata Purana\", the \"Brahma Vaivarta Purana,\" and the \"Bhagavad Gita\", and is mentioned in many Hindu philosophical, theological, and mythological texts. They portray him in various perspectives: as a god-child, a prankster, a model lover, a divine hero, and the universal supreme being. His iconography reflects these legends and shows him in different stages of his life, such as an infant eating butter, a young boy playing a flute, a handsome youth with Radha or surrounded by female devotees, or a friendly charioteer giving counsel to Arjuna.\nThe name and synonyms of Krishna have been traced to 1stmillenniumBCE literature and cults. In some sub-traditions, like Krishnaism, Krishna is worshipped as the Supreme God and \"Svayam Bhagavan\" (God Himself). These sub-traditions arose in the context of the medieval era Bhakti movement. Krishna-related literature has inspired numerous performance arts such as Bharatanatyam, Kathakali, Kuchipudi, Odissi, and Manipuri dance. He is a pan-Hindu god, but is particularly revered in some locations, such as Vrindavan in Uttar Pradesh, Dwarka and Junagadh in Gujarat; the Jagannatha aspect in Odisha, Mayapur in West Bengal; in the form of Vithoba in Pandharpur, Maharashtra, Shrinathji at Nathdwara in Rajasthan, Udupi Krishna in Karnataka, Parthasarathy in Tamil Nadu, Aranmula and Guruvayoorappan (Guruvayoor) in Kerala.\nSince the 1960s, the worship of Krishna has also spread to the Western world, largely due to the work of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON).\nNames and epithets.\nThe name \"Krishna\" originates from the Sanskrit word \"\", which means \"black\", \"dark\" or \"dark blue\". The waning moon is called Krishna Paksha, relating to the adjective meaning \"darkening\". Some Vaishnavas also translate the word as \"All-Attractive\", though it lacks that meaning in Sanskrit.\nAs a name of Vishnu, Krishna is listed as the 57th name in the \"Vishnu Sahasranama\". Based on his name, Krishna is often depicted in idols as black- or blue-skinned. Krishna is also known by various other names, epithets, and titles that reflect his many associations and attributes. Among the most common names are \"Mohan\" \"enchanter\"; \"Govinda\" \"chief herdsman\", \"Keev\" \"prankster\", and \"Gopala\" \"Protector of the 'Go'\", which means \"soul\" or \"the cows\". Some names for Krishna hold regional importance; \"Jagannatha\", found in the Puri Hindu temple, is a popular incarnation in Odisha state and nearby regions of eastern India.\nHistorical and literary sources.\nThe tradition of Krishna appears to be an amalgamation of several independent deities of ancient India, the earliest of whom to be attested being V\u0101sudeva. V\u0101sudeva was a hero-god of the tribe of the Vrishnis, belonging to the Vrishni heroes, whose worship is attested from the 5th\u20136th century BCE in the writings of P\u0101\u1e47ini, and from the 2nd century BCE in epigraphy with the Heliodorus pillar. At one point in time, it is thought that the tribe of the Vrishnis fused with the tribe of the Yadavas, whose own hero-god was named Krishna. V\u0101sudeva and Krishna fused to become a single deity, which appears in the \"Mahabharata\", and they started to be identified with Vishnu in the \"Mahabharata\" and the \"Bhagavad Gita\". Around the 4th century CE, another tradition, the cult of Gopala-Krishna of the \u0100bh\u012bras, the protector of cattle, was also absorbed into the Krishna tradition.\nEarly epigraphic sources.\nDepiction in coinage (2nd century BCE).\nAround 180 BCE, the Indo-Greek king Agathocles issued some coinage (discovered in Ai-Khanoum, Afghanistan) bearing images of deities that are now interpreted as being related to Vaisnava imagery in India. The deities displayed on the coins appear to be Sa\u1e43kar\u1e63a\u1e47a-Balarama with attributes consisting of the gada mace and the plow, and V\u0101sudeva-Krishna with attributes of the shankha (conch) and the sudarshana chakra wheel. According to Bopearachchi, the headdress of the deity is actually a misrepresentation of a shaft with a half-moon parasol on top (chattra).\nInscriptions.\nThe Heliodorus Pillar, a stone pillar with a Brahmi script inscription, was discovered by colonial era archaeologists in Besnagar (Vidisha, in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh). Based on the internal evidence of the inscription, it has been dated to between 125 and 100BCE and is now known after Heliodorus \u2013 an Indo-Greek who served as an ambassador of the Greek king Antialcidas to a regional Indian king, Kasiputra Bhagabhadra. The Heliodorus pillar inscription is a private religious dedication of Heliodorus to \"V\u0101sudeva\", an early deity and another name for Krishna in the Indian tradition. It states that the column was constructed by \"the \"Bhagavata\" Heliodorus\" and that it is a \"\"Garuda\" pillar\" (both are Vishnu-Krishna-related terms). Additionally, the inscription includes a Krishna-related verse from chapter11.7 of the \"Mahabharata\" stating that the path to immortality and heaven is to correctly live a life of three virtues: self-temperance (\"damah\"), generosity (\"cagah\" or \"tyaga\"), and vigilance (\"apramadah\"). The Heliodorus pillar site was fully excavated by archaeologists in the 1960s. The effort revealed the brick foundations of a much larger ancient elliptical temple complex with a sanctum, \"mandapas\", and seven additional pillars. The Heliodorus pillar inscriptions and the temple are among the earliest known evidence of Krishna-Vasudeva devotion and Vaishnavism in ancient India.\nThe Heliodorus inscription is not isolated evidence. The Hathibada Ghosundi Inscriptions, all located in the state of Rajasthan and dated by modern methodology to the 1stcenturyBCE, mention Sa\u1e43kar\u1e63a\u1e47a and V\u0101sudeva, also mention that the structure was built for their worship in association with the supreme deity Narayana. These four inscriptions are notable for being some of the oldest-known Sanskrit inscriptions.\nA Mora stone slab found at the Mathura-Vrindavan archaeological site in Uttar Pradesh, held now in the Mathura Museum, has a Brahmi inscription. It is dated to the 1stcenturyCE and mentions the five Vrishni heroes, otherwise known as Sa\u1e43kar\u1e63a\u1e47a, V\u0101sudeva, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, and Samba.\nThe inscriptional record for V\u0101sudeva starts in the 2nd century BCE with the coinage of Agathocles and the Heliodorus pillar, but the name of Krishna appears rather later in epigraphy. At the Chilas II archaeological site dated to the first half of the 1st-century CE in northwest Pakistan, near the Afghanistan border, are engraved two males, along with many Buddhist images nearby. The larger of the two males held a plough and club in his two hands. The artwork also has an inscription with it in Kharosthi script, which has been deciphered by scholars as \"Rama-Krsna\", and interpreted as an ancient depiction of the two brothers, Balarama and Krishna.\nThe first known depiction of the life of Krishna himself comes relatively late, with found in Mathura, and dated to the 1st\u20132nd century CE. This fragment seems to show Vasudeva, Krishna's father, carrying baby Krishna in a basket across the Yamuna. The relief shows at one end a seven-hooded Naga crossing a river, where a \"makara\" crocodile is thrashing around, and at the other end a person seemingly holding a basket over his head.\nLiterary sources.\nMahabharata.\nThe earliest text containing detailed descriptions of Krishna as a personality is the epic \"Mahabharata\", which depicts Krishna as an incarnation of Vishnu. Krishna is central to many of the main stories of the epic. The eighteen chapters of the sixth book (\"Bhishma Parva\") of the epic that constitute the \"Bhagavad Gita\" contain the advice of Krishna to Arjuna on the battlefield.\nDuring the ancient times that the \"Bhagavad Gita\" was composed in, Krishna was widely seen as an avatar of Vishnu rather than an individual deity, yet he was immensely powerful and almost everything in the universe other than Vishnu was \"somehow present in the body of Krishna\". Krishna had \"no beginning or end\", \"fill[ed] space\", and every god but Vishnu was seen as ultimately him, including Brahma, \"storm gods, sun gods, bright gods\", light gods, \"and gods of ritual.\" Other forces also existed in his body, such as \"hordes of varied creatures\" that included \"celestial serpents.\" He is also \"the essence of humanity.\"\nThe \"Harivamsa\", a later appendix to the \"Mahabharata,\" contains a detailed version of Krishna's childhood and youth.\nOther sources.\nThe \"Chandogya Upanishad\" (verse III.xvii.6) mentions Krishna in \"Krishnaya Devakiputraya\" as a student of the sage Ghora of the Angirasa family. Ghora is identified with Neminatha, the twenty-second \"tirthankara\" in Jainism, by some scholars. This phrase, which means \"To Krishna the son of Devaki\", has been mentioned by scholars such as Max M\u00fcller as a potential source of fables and Vedic lore about Krishna in the \"Mahabharata\" and other ancient literature\u00a0\u2013 only potential because this verse could have been interpolated into the text, or the Krishna Devakiputra, could be different from the deity Krishna. These doubts are supported by the fact that the much later age \"Sandilya Bhakti Sutras\", a treatise on Krishna, cites later age compilations such as the \"Narayana Upanishad\" but never cites this verse of the Chandogya Upanishad. Other scholars disagree that the Krishna mentioned along with Devaki in the ancient Upanishad is unrelated to the later Hindu god of the \"Bhagavad Gita\" fame. For example, Archer states that the coincidence of the two names appearing together in the same Upanishad verse cannot be dismissed easily.\nY\u0101ska's \"Nirukta\", an etymological dictionary published around the 6thcenturyBCE, contains a reference to the Shyamantaka jewel in the possession of Akrura, a motif from the well-known Puranic story about Krishna. Shatapatha Brahmana and \"Aitareya-Aranyaka\" associate Krishna with his Vrishni origins.\nIn \"Ash\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b\", authored by the ancient grammarian P\u0101\u1e47ini (probably belonged to the 5th or 6thcenturyBCE), \"V\u0101sudeva\" and \"Arjuna\", as recipients of worship, are referred to together in the same \"sutra\".\nMegasthenes, a Greek ethnographer and an ambassador of Seleucus I to the court of Chandragupta Maurya towards the end of 4thcenturyBCE, made reference to Herakles in his famous work Indica. This text is now lost to history, but was quoted in secondary literature by later Greeks such as Arrian, Diodorus, and Strabo. According to these texts, Megasthenes mentioned that the Sourasenoi tribe of India, who worshipped Herakles, had two major cities named Methora and Kleisobora, and a navigable river named the Jobares. According to Edwin Bryant, a professor of Indian religions known for his publications on Krishna, \"there is little doubt that the Sourasenoi refers to the Shurasenas, a branch of the Yadu dynasty to which Krishna belonged\". The word Herakles, states Bryant, is likely a Greek phonetic equivalent of Hari-Krishna, as is Methora of Mathura, Kleisobora of Krishnapura, and the Jobares of Jamuna. Later, when Alexander the Great launched his campaign in the northwest Indian subcontinent, his associates recalled that the soldiers of Porus were carrying an image of Herakles.\nThe Buddhist Pali canon and the Ghata-J\u00e2taka (No. 454) polemically mention the devotees of V\u00e2sudeva and Baladeva. These texts have many peculiarities and may be a garbled and confused version of the Krishna legends. The texts of Jainism mention these tales as well, also with many peculiarities and different versions, in their legends about Tirthankaras. This inclusion of Krishna-related legends in ancient Buddhist and Jaina literature suggests that Krishna theology was existent and important in the religious landscape observed by non-Hindu traditions of ancient India.\nThe ancient Sanskrit grammarian Patanjali in his \"Mahabhashya\" makes several references to Krishna and his associates found in later Indian texts. In his commentary on P\u0101\u1e47ini's verse 3.1.26, he also uses the word \"Kamsavadha\" or the \"killing of Kamsa\", an important part of the legends surrounding Krishna.\nPuranas.\nMany Puranas tell Krishna's life story or some highlights from it. Two Puranas, the \"Bhagavata Purana\" and the \"Vishnu Purana\", contain the most elaborate telling of Krishna's story, but the life stories of Krishna in these and other texts vary, and contain significant inconsistencies. The \"Bhagavata Purana\" consists of twelve books subdivided into 332chapters, with a cumulative total of between 16,000 and 18,000 verses depending on the version. The tenth book of the text, which contains about 4,000 verses (~25%) and is dedicated to legends about Krishna, has been the most popular and widely studied part of this text.\nIconography.\nKrishna is represented in the Indian traditions in many ways, but with some common features. His iconography typically depicts him with black, dark, or blue skin, like Vishnu. But ancient and medieval reliefs and stone-based arts depict him in the natural color of the material out of which he is formed, both in India and in southeast Asia. In some texts, his skin is poetically described as the color of Jambul (\"Jamun\", a black-colored fruit).\nKrishna is often depicted wearing a peacock-feather wreath or crown, and playing the bansuri (Indian flute). In this form, he is usually shown standing with one leg bent in front of the other in the \"Tribhanga\" posture. He is sometimes accompanied by cows or a calf, which symbolise the divine herdsman \"Govinda\". Alternatively, he is shown as a romantic young boy with the gopis (milkmaids), often making music or playing pranks.\nIn other icons, he is a part of battlefield scenes of the epic \"Mahabharata\". He is shown as a charioteer, notably when he is addressing the Pandava prince Arjuna, symbolically reflecting the events that led to the \"Bhagavad Gita\"\u00a0\u2013 a scripture of Hinduism. In these popular depictions, Krishna appears in the front as the charioteer, either as a counsel listening to Arjuna or as the driver of the chariot while Arjuna aims his arrows in the battlefield of Kurukshetra.\nAlternate icons of Krishna show him as a baby (\"Bala Krishna\", the child Krishna), a toddler crawling on his hands and knees, a dancing child, or an innocent-looking child playfully stealing or consuming butter (\"Makkan Chor\"), holding Laddu in his hand (\"Laddu Gopal\") or as a cosmic infant sucking his toe while floating on a banyan leaf during the Pralaya (the cosmic dissolution) observed by sage Markandeya. Regional variations in the iconography of Krishna are seen in his different forms, such as Jaganatha in Odisha, Vithoba in Maharashtra, Shrinathji in Rajasthan and Guruvayoorappan in Kerala.\nGuidelines for the preparation of Krishna icons in design and architecture are described in medieval-era Sanskrit texts on Hindu temple arts such as \"Vaikhanasa agama\", \"Vishnu dharmottara\", \"Brihat samhita\", and \"Agni Purana\". Similarly, early medieval-era Tamil texts also contain guidelines for sculpting Krishna and Rukmini. Several statues made according to these guidelines are in the collections of the Government Museum, Chennai.\nKrishna iconography forms an important element in the figural sculpture on 17th\u201319th century terracotta temples of Bengal. In many temples, the stories of Krishna are depicted on a long series of narrow panels along the base of the facade. In other temples, the important Krishnalila episodes are depicted on large brick panels above the entrance arches or on the walls surrounding the entrance.\nLife and legends.\nThis summary is an account based on literary details from the \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\", the \"Harivamsa\", the \"Bhagavata Purana\", and the \"Vishnu Purana\". The scenes from the narrative are set in ancient India, mostly in the present states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Haryana, Delhi, and Gujarat. The legends about Krishna's life are called \"Krishna charitas\" (IAST: K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47acaritas).\nBirth.\nIn the \"Krishna Charitas\", Krishna is born to Devaki and her husband, Vasudeva, in Mathura. Devaki's brother is a tyrant named Kamsa. At Devaki's wedding, according to Puranic legends, Kamsa is told by fortune tellers that a child of Devaki would kill him. Sometimes, it is depicted as an akashvani announcing Kamsa's death. Kamsa arranges to kill all of Devaki's children. When Krishna is born, Vasudeva secretly carries the infant Krishna away across the Yamuna, and exchanges him with Yashoda's daughter. When Kamsa tries to kill the newborn, the exchanged baby appears as the Hindu goddess Yogamaya, warning him that his death has arrived in his kingdom, and then disappears, according to the legends in the Puranas. Krishna grows up with Nanda and his wife, Yashoda, near modern-day Mathura. Two of Krishna's siblings also survive, namely Balarama and Subhadra, according to these legends. The day of the birth of Krishna is celebrated as Krishna Janmashtami.\nChildhood and youth.\nThe legends of Krishna's childhood and youth describe him as a cow-herder, a mischievous boy whose pranks earn him the nickname \"Makhan Chor\" (butter thief), and a protector who steals the hearts of the people in both Gokul and Vrindavana. The texts state, for example, that Krishna lifts the Govardhana hill to protect the inhabitants of Vrindavana from devastating rains and floods.\nOther legends describe him as an enchanter and playful lover of the gopis (milkmaids) of Vrindavana, especially Radha. These metaphor-filled love stories are known as the \"Rasa lila\" and were romanticized in the poetry of Jayadeva, author of the Gita Govinda. They are also central to the development of the Krishna bhakti traditions worshiping Radha Krishna.\nKrishna's childhood illustrates the Hindu concept of \"Lila\", playing for fun and enjoyment and not for sport or gain. His interaction with the gopis at the rasa dance or Rasa-lila is an example. Krishna plays his flute and the gopis come immediately, from whatever they were doing, to the banks of the Yamuna River and join him in singing and dancing. Even those who could not physically be there join him through meditation. He is the spiritual essence and the love-eternal in existence, the gopis metaphorically represent the \"prak\u1e5bti\" matter and the impermanent body.\nThis \"Lila\" is a constant theme in the legends of Krishna's childhood and youth. Even when he is battling with a serpent to protect others, he is described in Hindu texts as if he were playing a game. This quality of playfulness in Krishna is celebrated during festivals as Rasa-Lila and Janmashtami, where Hindus in some regions such as Maharashtra playfully mimic his legends, such as by making human gymnastic pyramids to break open \"handis\" (clay pots) hung high in the air to \"steal\" butter or buttermilk, spilling it all over the group.\nAdulthood.\nKrishna legends then describe his return to Mathura. He overthrows and kills the tyrant king, his maternal uncle Kamsa/Kansa after quelling several assassination attempts by Kamsa. He reinstates Kamsa's father, Ugrasena, as the king of the Yadavas and becomes a leading prince at the court. In one version of the Krishna story, as narrated by Shanta Rao, Krishna after Kamsa's death leads the Yadavas to the newly built city of Dwaraka. Thereafter Pandavas rise. Krishna befriends Arjuna and the other Pandava princes of the Kuru kingdom. Krishna plays a key role in the \"Mahabharata\".\nThe Bhagavata Purana describes eight wives of Krishna that appear in sequence as Rukmini, Satyabhama, Jambavati, Kalindi, Mitravinda, Nagnajiti (also called Satya), Bhadra and Lakshmana (also called Madra). This has been interpreted as a metaphor where each of the eight wives signifies a different aspect of him. Vaishnava texts mention all Gopis as wives of Krishna, but this is understood as spiritual symbolism of devotional relationship and Krishna's complete loving devotion to each and everyone devoted to him.\nIn Krishna-related Hindu traditions, he is most commonly seen with Radha. All of his wives and his lover Radha are considered in the Hindu tradition to be the avatars of the goddess Lakshmi, the consort of Vishnu. Gopis are considered as Lakshmi's or Radha's manifestations.\nKurukshetra War and \"Bhagavad Gita\".\nAccording to the epic poem \"Mahabharata\", Krishna becomes Arjuna's charioteer for the Kurukshetra War, but on the condition that he personally will not raise any weapon. Upon arrival at the battlefield and seeing that the enemies are his family, his grandfather, and his cousins and loved ones, Arjuna is moved and says his heart will not allow him to fight and kill others. He would rather renounce the kingdom and put down his \"Gandiva\" (Arjuna's bow). Krishna then advises him about the nature of life, ethics, and morality when one is faced with a war between good and evil, the impermanence of matter, the permanence of the soul and the good, duties and responsibilities, the nature of true peace and bliss and the different types of yoga to reach this state of bliss and inner liberation. This conversation between Krishna and Arjuna is presented as a discourse called the \"Bhagavad Gita\".\nDeath and ascension.\nIt is stated in the Indian texts that the legendary Kurukshetra War led to the death of all the hundred sons of Gandhari. After Duryodhana's death, Krishna visits Gandhari to offer his condolences when Gandhari and Dhritarashtra visited Kurukshetra, as stated in Stree Parva. Feeling that Krishna deliberately did not put an end to the war, in a fit of rage and sorrow, Gandhari said, \"Thou were indifferent to the Kurus and the Pandavas whilst they slew each other. Therefore, O Govinda, thou shalt be the slayer of thy own kinsmen!\" According to the \"Mahabharata\", a fight breaks out at a festival among the Yadavas, who end up killing each other. Mistaking the sleeping Krishna for a deer, a hunter named Jara shoots an arrow towards Krishna's foot that fatally injures him. Krishna forgives \"Jara\" and dies. The pilgrimage (\"tirtha\") site of Bhalka in Gujarat marks the location where Krishna is believed to have died. It is also known as \"Dehotsarga\", states Diana L. Eck, a term that literally means the place where Krishna \"gave up his body\". The \"Bhagavata Purana\" in Book 11, Chapter 31 states that after his death, Krishna returned to his transcendent abode directly because of his yogic concentration. Waiting gods such as Brahma and Indra were unable to trace the path Krishna took to leave his human incarnation and return to his abode.\nVersions and interpretations.\nThere are numerous versions of Krishna's life story, of which three are most studied: the \"Harivamsa\", the \"Bhagavata Purana\", and the \"Vishnu Purana\". They share the basic storyline but vary significantly in their specifics, details, and styles. The most original composition, the \"Harivamsa\" is told in a realistic style that describes Krishna's life as a poor herder but weaves in poetic and allusive fantasy. It ends on a triumphal note, not with the death of Krishna. Differing in some details, the fifth book of the \"Vishnu Purana\" moves away from \"Harivamsa\" realism and embeds Krishna in mystical terms and eulogies. The \"Vishnu Purana\" manuscripts exist in many versions.\nThe tenth and eleventh books of the \"Bhagavata Purana\" are widely considered to be a poetic masterpiece, full of imagination and metaphors, with no relation to the realism of pastoral life found in the \"Harivamsa\". Krishna's life is presented as a cosmic play (\"Lila\"), where his youth is set as a princely life with his foster father Nanda portrayed as a king. Krishna's life is closer to that of a human being in \"Harivamsa\", but is a symbolic universe in the \"Bhagavata Purana\", where Krishna is within the universe and beyond it, as well as the universe itself, always. The \"Bhagavata Purana\" manuscripts also exist in many versions, in numerous Indian languages.\nProposed datings and historicity.\nThe date of Krishna's birth is celebrated every year as Janmashtami.\nAccording to Guy Beck, \"most scholars of Hinduism and Indian history accept the historicity of Krishna\u00a0\u2013 that he was a real male person, whether human or divine, who lived on Indian soil by at least 1000 BCE and interacted with many other historical persons within the cycles of the epic and puranic histories.\" Yet, Beck also notes that there is an \"enormous number of contradictions and discrepancies surrounding the chronology of Krishna's life as depicted in the Sanskrit canon\".\nSome scholars believe that, among others, the detailed description of Krishna's peace mission in the 5th Book of the Mahabharata (Udyogaparvan) is likely to be based on real events. The epic's translator J.A.B. van Buitenen in this context assumes \"that there was some degree of verisimilitude in the Mahabharata\u2019s depictions of life.\"\nPhilosophy and theology.\nA wide range of theological and philosophical ideas are presented through Krishna in Hindu texts. The teachings of the \"Bhagavad Gita\" can be considered, according to Friedhelm Hardy, as the first Krishnaite system of theology.\nRamanuja, a Hindu theologian and philosopher whose works were influential in Bhakti movement, presented Krishna in terms of qualified monism, or nondualism (namely Vishishtadvaita school). Madhvacharya, a philosopher whose works led to the founding of Haridasa tradition of Vaishnavism, presented Krishna in the framework of dualism (Dvaita). Bhedabheda\u00a0\u2013 a group of schools, which teaches that the individual self is both different and not different from the ultimate reality\u00a0\u2013 predates the positions of monism and dualism. Among medieval Bhedabheda thinkers are Nimbarkacharya, who founded the Kumara Sampradaya (Dvaitadvaita philosophical school), and Jiva Goswami, a saint from Gaudiya Vaishnava school, who described Krishna theology in terms of Bhakti yoga and Achintya Bheda Abheda. Krishna theology is presented in a pure monism (\"Shuddhadvaita\") framework by Vallabha Acharya, the founder of Pushti sect of Vaishnavism. Madhusudana Sarasvati, an India philosopher, presented Krishna theology in nondualism-monism framework (Advaita Vedanta), while Adi Shankara, credited with unifying and establishing the main currents of thought in Hinduism, mentioned Krishna in his early eighth-century discussions on Panchayatana puja.\nThe \"Bhagavata Purana\" synthesizes an Advaita, Samkhya, and Yoga framework for Krishna, but it does so through loving devotion to Krishna. Bryant describes the synthesis of ideas in Bhagavata Purana as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The philosophy of the Bhagavata is a mixture of Vedanta terminology, Samkhyan metaphysics, and devotionalized Yoga praxis. (...) The tenth book promotes Krishna as the highest absolute personal aspect of godhead\u00a0\u2013 the personality behind the term Ishvara and the ultimate aspect of Brahman.\u2014\u200a\nWhile Sheridan and Pintchman both affirm Bryant's view, the latter adds that the Vedantic view emphasized in the Bhagavata is non-dualist with a difference. In conventional nondual Vedanta, all reality is interconnected and one, the Bhagavata posits that the reality is interconnected and plural.\nAcross the various theologies and philosophies, the common theme presents Krishna as the essence and symbol of divine love, with human life and love as a reflection of the divine. The longing and love-filled legends of Krishna and the gopis, his playful pranks as a baby, as well as his later dialogues with other figures, are philosophically treated as metaphors for the human longing for the divine and for meaning, and the play between the universals and the human soul. Krishna's \"lila\" is a theology of love-play. According to John Koller, \"love is presented not simply as a means to salvation, it is the highest life\". Human love is God's love.\nOther texts that include Krishna such as the \"Bhagavad Gita\" have attracted numerous \"bhasya\" (commentaries) in the Hindu traditions. Though only a part of the Hindu epic \"Mahabharata\", the Bhagavad Gita has functioned as an independent spiritual guide. It allegorically raises the ethical and moral dilemmas of human life through Krishna and Arjuna. It then presents a spectrum of answers, addressing the ideological questions on human freedoms, choices, and responsibilities towards self and others. This Krishna dialogue has attracted numerous interpretations, from being a metaphor for inner human struggle that teaches non-violence to being a metaphor for outer human struggle that advocates a rejection of quietism and persecution.\nMadhusudana Sarasvati, known for his contributions to classical Advaita Vedanta, was also a devotee of Krishna and expressed his devotion in various verses within his works, notably in his Bhagavad Gita commentary, Bhagavad Gita Gudarthadipika. In his works, Krishna is identified as Supreme Deity and as Bhagavan, whom Madhusudana describes as nondual Self, embodying Being, Consciousness, and Bliss, the pure Existence underlying all. In his commentary on the Gita, Krishna is often interpreted as representing nirguna Brahman, thus presenting a transtheistic understanding of deity.\nInfluence.\nVaishnavism.\nThe worship of Krishna is part of Vaishnavism, a major tradition within Hinduism. Krishna is considered a full avatar of Vishnu, or one with Vishnu himself. However, the exact relationship between Krishna and Vishnu is complex and diverse, with Krishna of Krishnaite sampradayas considered an independent deity and supreme. Vaishnavas accept many incarnations of Vishnu, but Krishna is particularly important. Their theologies are generally centered either on Vishnu or an avatar such as Krishna as supreme. The terms Krishnaism and Vishnuism have sometimes been used to distinguish the two, the former implying that Krishna is the transcendent Supreme Being. Some scholars, as Friedhelm Hardy, do not define Krishnaism as a sub-order or offshoot of Vaishnavism, considering it a parallel and no less ancient current of Hinduism.\nAll Vaishnava traditions recognise Krishna as the eighth avatar of Vishnu; others identify Krishna with Vishnu, while Krishnaite traditions such as Gaudiya Vaishnavism, Ekasarana Dharma, Mahanam Sampraday, Nimbarka Sampradaya and the Vallabha Sampradaya regard Krishna not just as an avatar of Vishnu, but as the \"Svayam Bhagavan\", the original form of Lord or the same as the concept of Brahman in Hinduism. Gitagovinda of Jayadeva considers Krishna to be the supreme lord while the ten incarnations are his forms. Swaminarayan, the founder of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya, also worshipped Krishna as God himself. \"Greater Krishnaism\" corresponds to the second and dominant phase of Vaishnavism, revolving around the cults of the Vasudeva, Krishna, and Gopala of the late Vedic period. Today the faith has a significant following outside of India as well.\nEarly traditions.\nThe deity \"Krishna-Vasudeva\" (\"\" \"Krishna, the son of Vasudeva Anakadundubhi\") is historically one of the earliest forms of worship in Krishnaism and Vaishnavism. It is believed to be a significant tradition of the early history of Krishna religion in antiquity. Thereafter, there was an amalgamation of various similar traditions. These include ancient Bhagavatism, the cult of Gopala, of \"Krishna Govinda\" (cow-finding Krishna), of Balakrishna (baby Krishna) and of \"Krishna Gopivallabha\" (Krishna the lover). According to Andre Couture, the Harivamsa contributed to the synthesis of various figures as aspects of Krishna.\nAlready in the early Middle Ages, Jagannathism (a.k.a. Odia Vaishnavism) originated as the cult of the god Jagannath (lit.\u2009''Lord of the Universe'')\u00a0\u2013 an abstract form of Krishna. Jagannathism was a regional temple-centered version of Krishnaism, where Jagannath is understood as a principal god, Purushottama and Para Brahman, but can also be regarded as a non-sectarian syncretic Vaishnavite and all-Hindu cult. According to the \"Vishnudharma Purana\" (c. 4th century), Krishna is woshipped in the form of Purushottama in Odia (Odisha). The notable Jagannath temple in Puri, Odisha has been particularly significant within the tradition since about 800 CE.\nBhakti tradition.\nThe use of the term bhakti, meaning devotion, is not confined to any one deity. However, Krishna is an important and popular focus of the devotionalism tradition within Hinduism, particularly among the Vaishnava Krishnaite sects. Devotees of Krishna subscribe to the concept of \"lila\", meaning 'divine play', as the central principle of the universe. It is a form of bhakti yoga, one of three types of yoga discussed by Krishna in the \"Bhagavad Gita\".\nIndian subcontinent.\nThe bhakti movements devoted to Krishna became prominent in southern India in the 7th to 9thcenturies CE. The earliest works included those of the Alvar saints of Tamil Nadu. A major collection of their works is the \"Divya Prabandham\". Alvar Andal's popular collection of songs Tiruppavai, in which she conceives of herself as a gopi, is the most famous of the oldest works in this genre.\nThe movement originated in South India during the 7th century CE, spreading northwards from Tamil Nadu through Karnataka and Maharashtra; by the 15thcentury, it was established in Bengal and northern India. Early Krishnaite Bhakti pioneers included Nimbarkacharya (7thcentury CE), and his disciple Srinivasacharya but most emerged later, including Vallabhacharya (15thcentury CE) and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. They started their own schools, namely Nimbarka Sampradaya, Vallabha Sampradaya, and Gaudiya Vaishnavism, with Krishna and Radha as the supreme gods. In addition, since the 15th century, flourished Tantric variety of Krishnaism, Vaishnava-Sahajiya, is linked to the Bengali poet Chandidas.\nIn the Deccan, particularly in Maharashtra, saint poets of the Warkari sect such as Dnyaneshwar, Namdev, Janabai, Eknath, and Tukaram promoted the worship of Vithoba, a local form of Krishna, from the 13th to 18th century. Before the Warkari tradition, Krishna devotion became well established in Maharashtra due to the rise of the Mahanubhava Sampradaya founded by Sarvajna Chakradhara. The Pranami Sampradaya emerged in the 17th century in Gujarat, based on the Krishna-focussed syncretist Hindu-Islamic teachings of Devchandra Maharaj and his famous successor, Mahamati Prannath. In southern India, Purandara Dasa and Kanakadasa of Karnataka composed songs devoted to the Krishna image of Udupi. Rupa Goswami of Gaudiya Vaishnavism has compiled a comprehensive summary of bhakti called Bhakti-rasamrita-sindhu.\nIn South India, the acharyas of the Sri Sampradaya have written reverently about Krishna in most of their works, including the \"Tiruppavai\" by Andal and \"Gopalavimshati\" by Vedanta Desika.\nTamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Kerala states have many major Krishna temples, and Janmashtami is one of the widely celebrated festivals in South India.\nOutside Asia.\nBy 1965, the \"Krishna-bhakti\" movement had spread outside India after Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada (as instructed by his guru, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura) travelled from his homeland in West Bengal to New York City. A year later, in 1966, after gaining many followers, he was able to form the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), popularly known as the Hare Krishna movement. The purpose of this movement was to write about Krishna in English and to share the Gaudiya Vaishnava philosophy with people in the Western world by spreading the teachings of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. In the biographies of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, the mantra he received when he was given diksha or initiation in Gaya was the six-word verse of the \"Kali-Santarana Upanishad\", namely \"Hare Krishna Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna Hare Hare; Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama Hare Hare\". In the Gaudiya tradition, it is the \"maha-mantra\", or the great mantra of Krishna bhakti. The chanting of this \"maha-mantra\" is known as \"hari-nama sankirtana\".\nThe \"maha-mantra\" gained the attention of George Harrison and John Lennon of the Beatles fame, and Harrison produced a 1969 recording of the mantra by devotees from the London Radha Krishna Temple. Titled \"Hare Krishna Mantra\", the song reached the top twenty on the UK music charts and was also successful in West Germany and Czechoslovakia. The mantra of the Upanishad thus helped bring Bhaktivedanta and ISKCON ideas about Krishna into the West. ISKCON has built many Krishna temples in the West, as well as other locations such as South Africa.\nSoutheast Asia.\nKrishna is found in Southeast Asian history and art, but to a far lesser extent than Shiva, Durga, Nandi, Agastya, and Buddha. In temples (\"candi\") of the archaeological sites in hilly volcanic Java, Indonesia, temple reliefs do not portray his pastoral life or his role as the erotic lover, nor do the historic Javanese Hindu texts. Rather, either his childhood or the life as a king and Arjuna's companion have been more favored. The most elaborate temple arts of Krishna is found in a series of \"Krsnayana\" reliefs in the Prambanan Hindu temple complex near Yogyakarta. These are dated to the 9thcentury CE. Krishna remained a part of the Javanese cultural and theological fabric through the 14thcentury, as evidenced by the 14th-century Penataran reliefs along with those of the Hindu god Rama in east Java, before Islam replaced Buddhism and Hinduism on the island.\nThe medieval era arts of Vietnam and Cambodia feature Krishna. The earliest surviving sculptures and reliefs are from the 6th and 7thcenturies, and these include Vaishnavism iconography. According to John Guy, the curator and director of Southeast Asian arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Krishna Govardhana art from 6th/7th-century Vietnam at Danang, and 7th-century Cambodia at Phnom Da cave in Angkor Borei, are some of the most sophisticated of this era.\nKrishna's iconography has also been found in Thailand, along with those of Surya and Vishnu. For example, a large number of sculptures and icons have been found in the SiThep and Klangnai sites in the Phetchabun region of northern Thailand. These are dated to about the 7th and 8thcenturies, from both the Funan and Zhenla period archaeological sites.\nPerformance arts.\nDance and culture.\nIndian dance and music theatre traces its origins and techniques to the ancient \"Sama Veda\" and \"Natyasastra\" texts. The stories enacted and the numerous choreographic themes are inspired by the legends in Hindu texts, including Krishna-related literature such as \"Harivamsa\" and \"Bhagavata Purana\".\nThe Krishna stories have played a key role in the history of Indian theatre, music, and dance, particularly through the tradition of \"Rasaleela\". These are dramatic enactments of Krishna's childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. One common scene involves Krishna playing flute in Rasa Leela, only to be heard by certain gopis (cowherd maidens), which is theologically supposed to represent divine call only heard by certain enlightened beings. Some of the text's legends have inspired secondary theatre literature such as the eroticism in Gita Govinda.\nKrishna-related literature such as the \"Bhagavata Purana\" accords a metaphysical significance to the performances and treats them as a religious ritual, infusing daily life with spiritual meaning, thus representing a good, honest, happy life. Similarly, Krishna-inspired performances aim to cleanse the hearts of faithful actors and listeners. Singing, dancing, and performing any part of \"Krishna Lila\" is an act of remembering the dharma in the text, as a form of \"para bhakti\" (supreme devotion). To remember Krishna at any time and in any art, asserts the text, is to worship the good and the divine.\nClassical dance styles such as Kathak, Odissi, Manipuri, Kuchipudi and Bharatanatyam in particular are known for their Krishna-related performances. Krisnattam (Krishnattam) traces its origins to Krishna legends, and is linked to another major classical Indian dance form called Kathakali. Bryant summarizes the influence of Krishna stories in the \"Bhagavata Purana\" as, \"[it] has inspired more derivative literature, poetry, drama, dance, theatre and art than any other text in the history of Sanskrit literature, with the possible exception of the \"Ramayana\".\nThe Palliyodam, a type of large boat built and used by Aranmula Parthasarathy Temple in Kerala for the annual water processions of Uthrattathi Jalamela and Valla Sadhya has the legend that it was designed by Krishna and were made to look like Sheshanaga, the serpent on which Vishnu rests.\nOutside Hinduism.\nJainism.\nThe Jainism tradition lists 63 \"\u015aal\u0101k\u0101puru\u1e63a\" or notable figures which, amongst others, includes the twenty-four \"Tirthankaras\" (spiritual teachers) and nine sets of triads. One of these triads is Krishna as the \"Vasudeva\", Balarama as the \"Baladeva\", and Jarasandha as the \"Prati-Vasudeva\". In each age of the Jain cyclic time is born a \"Vasudeva\" with an elder brother termed the \"Baladeva\". Between the triads, \"Baladeva\" upholds the principle of non-violence, a central idea of Jainism. The villain is the \"Prati-vasudeva\", who attempts to destroy the world. To save the world, \"Vasudeva-Krishna\" has to forsake the non-violence principle and kill the \"Prati-Vasudeva\". The stories of these triads can be found in the \"Harivamsa Purana\" (8thcentury CE) of Jinasena (not be confused with its namesake, the addendum to \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\") and the \"Trishashti-shalakapurusha-charita\" of Hemachandra.\nThe story of Krishna's life in the \"Puranas\" of Jainism follows the same general outline as those in the Hindu texts, but in details, they are very different: they include Jain \"Tirthankaras\" as figures in the story, and generally are polemically critical of Krishna, unlike the versions found in the \"Mahabharata\", the \"Bhagavata Purana\", and the \"Vishnu Purana\". For example, Krishna loses battles in the Jain versions, and his \"gopis\" and his clan of Yadavas die in a fire created by an ascetic named Dvaipayana. Similarly, after dying from the hunter Jara's arrow, the Jaina texts state Krishna goes to the third hell in Jain cosmology, while his brother is said to go to the sixth heaven.\nVimalasuri is attributed to be the author of the Jain version of the \"Harivamsa Purana\", but no manuscripts have been found that confirm this. It is likely that later Jain scholars, probably Jinasena of the 8thcentury, wrote a complete version of Krishna legends in the Jain tradition and credited it to the ancient Vimalasuri. Partial and older versions of the Krishna story are available in Jain literature, such as in the \"Antagata Dasao\" of the \"Svetambara\" \"Agama\" tradition.\nIn other Jain texts, Krishna is stated to be a cousin of the twenty-second \"Tirthankara\", Neminatha. The Jain texts state that Neminatha taught Krishna all the wisdom that he later gave to Arjuna in the \"Bhagavad Gita\". According to Jeffery D. Long, a professor of religion known for his publications on Jainism, this connection between Krishna and Neminatha has been a historic reason for Jains to accept, read, and cite the \"Bhagavad Gita\" as a spiritually important text, celebrate Krishna-related festivals, and intermingle with Hindus as spiritual cousins.\nBuddhism.\nThe story of Krishna occurs in the Jataka tales in Buddhism. The \"Vidhurapandita Jataka\" mentions \"Madhura\" (Sanskrit: Mathura), the \"Ghata Jataka\" mentions Kamsa, Devagabbha (Sk: Devaki), Upasagara or Vasudeva, Govaddhana (Sk: Govardhana), Baladeva (Balarama), and Kanha or Kesava (Sk: Krishna, Keshava).\nLike the Jain versions of the Krishna legends, the Buddhist versions such as one in \"Ghata Jataka\" follow the general outline of the story, but are different from the Hindu versions as well. For example, the Buddhist legend describes Devagabbha (Devaki) to have been isolated in a palace built upon a pole after she is born, so no future husband could reach her. Krishna's father similarly is described as a powerful king, but who meets up with Devagabbha anyway, and to whom Kamsa gives away his sister Devagabbha in marriage. The siblings of Krishna are not killed by Kamsa, though he tries. In the Buddhist version of the legend, all of Krishna's siblings grow to maturity.\nKrishna and his siblings' capital becomes Dvaravati. The Arjuna and Krishna interaction is missing in the Jataka version. A new legend is included, wherein Krishna laments in uncontrollable sorrow when his son dies, and a Ghatapandita feigns madness to teach Krishna a lesson. The Jataka tale also includes internecine destruction among his siblings after they all get drunk. Krishna also dies in the Buddhist legend by the hand of a hunter named Jara, but while he is traveling to a frontier city. Mistaking Krishna for a pig, Jara throws a spear that fatally pierces his feet, causing Krishna great pain and then his death.\nAt the end of this \"Ghata-Jataka\" discourse, the Buddhist text declares that Sariputta, one of the revered disciples of the Buddha in the Buddhist tradition, was incarnated as Krishna in his previous life to learn lessons on grief from the Buddha in his prior rebirth:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Then he [Master] declared the Truths and identified the Birth: \"At that time, Ananda was Rohineyya, Sariputta was Vasudeva [Krishna], the followers of the Buddha were the other persons, and I myself was Ghatapandita.\"\u2014\u200a\nWhile the Buddhist Jataka texts co-opt Krishna-Vasudeva and make him a student of the Buddha in his previous life, the Hindu texts co-opt the Buddha and make him an avatar of Vishnu. In Chinese Buddhism, Taoism and Chinese folk religion, the figure of Krishna has been amalgamated and merged with that of Nalakuvara to influence the formation of the god Nezha, who has taken on iconographic characteristics of Krishna such as being presented as a divine god-child and slaying a n\u0101ga in his youth.\nOther.\nKrishna's life is written about in \"Krishna Avtar\" of the \"Chaubis Avtar\", a composition in Dasam Granth traditionally and historically attributed to Sikh Guru Gobind Singh.\nWithin the Sikh-derived 19th-century Radha Soami movement, the followers of its founder Shiv Dayal Singh used to consider him the Living Master and incarnation of God (Krishna/Vishnu).\nBah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds believe that Krishna was a \"Manifestation of God\", or one in a line of prophets who have revealed the Word of God progressively for a gradually maturing humanity. In this way, Krishna shares an exalted station with Abraham, Moses, Zoroaster, Buddha, Jesus, Muhammad, the B\u00e1b, and the founder of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h.\nAhmadiyya, a 20th-century Islamic movement, consider Krishna as one of their ancient prophets. Ghulam Ahmad stated that he was himself a prophet in the likeness of prophets such as Krishna, Jesus, and Muhammad, who had come to earth as a latter-day reviver of religion and morality.\nKrishna worship or reverence has been adopted by several new religious movements since the 19thcentury, and he is sometimes a member of an eclectic pantheon in occult texts, along with Greek, Buddhist, biblical, and even historical figures. For instance, \u00c9douard Schur\u00e9, an influential figure in perennial philosophy and occult movements, considered Krishna a \"Great Initiate\", while Theosophists regard Krishna as an incarnation of Maitreya (one of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom), the most important spiritual teacher for humanity along with Buddha.\nKrishna was canonised by Aleister Crowley and is recognised as a saint of Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica in the Gnostic Mass of Ordo Templi Orientis.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

There was intense rivalry during the 1990s among the best programmers, graphic artists and computer musicians to continually outdo each other's demos. Since the Amiga's hardware was more or less fixed (unlike today's PC industry, where arbitrary combinations of hardware can be put together), there was competition to test the limits of that hardware and perform theoretically \"impossible\" feats by refactoring the problem at hand. In Europe the Amiga was the undisputed leader of mainstream multimedia computing in the late 1980s and early 1990s, though it was eventually overtaken by PC architecture.\nSome Amiga demos, such as the RSI Megademo, Kefrens Megademo VIII or Crionics &amp; The Silents \"Hardwired\" are considered seminal works in the demo field. New Amiga demos are released even today, although the demo scene has firmly moved onto PC hardware. Many Amiga game developers were active in the demo scene.\nThe demo scene spearheaded development in multimedia programming techniques for the Amiga, such that it was de rigueur for the latest visual tricks, soundtrackers and 3D algorithms from the demo scene to end up being used in computer game development.\nDemo software.\nMost demos were written in 68000 assembly language, although a few were written in C and other languages. To utilize full hardware performance, Amiga demos were optimized and written entirely for one purpose in assembly (avoiding generic and portable code). Additional performance was achieved by utilizing several coprocessors, including a blitter, in parallel with the 68000. Most demos bypassed the operating system and addressed the hardware directly.\nFirst bigger demos were released in 1987, one of them was \"Tech Tech\" by Sodan &amp; Magician 42, it was released in November 1987 and is considered a classic by many.\nEric Schwartz produced a series of animated demos that ran with MoviePlayer, an animation software package similar to Toon Boom. The animated demos drew heavily on the whimsy and graphic style of comic strips.\nRed Sector Incorporated produced a piece of software called the RSI Demomaker, which allowed users to script their own demos, replete with scrolltext, vectorballs, plasma screens, etc.\nFull demos range from under 128 KB to several megabytes. There have been several thousand demos produced in many countries. Some active demo countries were Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, UK, Poland and others.\nIntros.\nSmaller demos are often known as \"intros\". They are typically limited to between 4 and 64KB in size. Intros were originally used as \"tags\" by cracking groups on computer games and other software. The purpose of the intro was to advertise cracking and distribution skill of a particular group. Later it developed into a stand-alone art form. Many demo and intro groups disassociated themselves from the cracking and copying scene, although the same people could still be involved in it.\nRipping.\nThe Amiga thrived on public domain, freeware and other not-for-profit development. The architecture provided no substantial mechanism for protecting software from inspection. In order to read the memory one simply performed a hot reset (which preserved the contents of RAM) and then booted to a dedicated floppy disk that could inspect and dump the memory's contents. It was therefore common for developers and hackers to \"rip\" music, graphics and code and then reuse it in their own productions. This led to intense competition in certain fields, for example, in the development of sound tracking software and \"Tetris\" clones, with each group of developers trying to outdo the current state of the art. In fact, some demos even featured their source code as part of the executable to save hackers the trouble of disassembly, though it came strewn with incendiary comments for those who would seek to improve on it."}

The three men come from different services with different ranks that do not correspond with their civilian social class backgrounds. It is one of the earliest films to address issues encountered by returning veterans in the post World War II era.\nThe film was a critical and commercial success. It won seven Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director (William Wyler), Best Actor (Fredric March), Best Supporting Actor (Harold Russell), Best Film Editing (Daniel Mandell), Best Adapted Screenplay (Robert E.

USAAF bombardier captain Fred Derry had been a drug store soda jerk who lived with his parents on the wrong side of the tracks. Before shipping out, Fred married a gold-digger named Marie after a whirlwind romance. Marie has since been working in a nightclub to fill her time (and her nightlife) in spite of Fred's generous combat pay as an Air Force officer. U.S. Army sergeant Al Stephenson is an executive at a bank whose wife Milly, and their teenage children, Peggy and Rob, live in a luxury apartment. U.S. Navy petty officer Homer Parrish was a star high school athlete living with his middle-class parents and younger sister and dating his next-door neighbor Wilma, whom he intended to marry upon his return from the war.\nEach man faces challenges integrating back into civilian life. Homer lost both hands in the war and though he has become functional in the use of his mechanical hooks, he cannot believe that Wilma will still want to marry him. Al, tired and jaded, returns to the bank and is given a promotion, but wrestles with alcohol. Fred suffers from PTSD flashbacks by night.\nFred arrives home and cannot locate his party girl wife, who does not expect him. The Stephensons and their daughter Peggy invite Fred along with them for the evening, bar hopping in celebration of Al's return. An inebriated Fred keeps asking Peggy who she is, and she reminds him that she is \"Al's daughter.\" When Fred is unable to get into his apartment, the Stephensons offer him a bed for the night. Later, Peggy calms Fred during a nightmare, and they develop a mutual attraction. When Peggy and her boyfriend invite Fred and Marie out to dinner, Peggy realizes how shallow and materialistic Marie is and determines to break up Fred's marriage.\nAlthough proficient in managing his disability, Homer is frustrated by his loss of independence. Concerned that Wilma doesn't fully understand the difficulties of being married to him with his disabilities, Homer demonstrates how she'll need to assist him at bedtime when he removes his prosthetic hands, leaving him helpless. Wilma reaffirms her love and vows her commitment for life.\nWidely respected by the bank's senior management for his past business acumen, Al is criticized after approving an unsecured loan to a farmer and fellow veteran without collateral. With inhibitions lowered by excessive drinking, Al gives a speech at a work banquet that satirizes requiring a veteran to provide collateral before risking his life to take a hill in battle.\nWith little work experience and unable to find a better job than soda jerk, Fred returns to the same drugstore. Fred and Peggy's attraction grows stronger, increasing tensions with her father Al. When Homer visits Fred at the drugstore, another customer criticizes US involvement in the war, telling Homer his injuries were unnecessary. Homer responds angrily, and Fred punches the customer, for which he's fired. Marie, frustrated with Fred's lack of financial success and missing her past nightlife, seeks a divorce.\nBitter and seeing no future in Boone City, particularly with Al telling him to stay away from Peggy, Fred decides to catch the next plane out. While waiting at the airport, Fred walks into an aircraft boneyard, climbing into the bombardier's seat of a decommissioned B-17 bomber. He's roused from a painful flashback by a work crew foreman, who tells him the planes are being demolished for use in the growing prefab housing industry. Fred asks if they need help in the budding business and is hired.\nAl, Milly, and Peggy attend Homer and Wilma's wedding, where Fred is best man. Now divorced, Fred reunites with Peggy and expresses his love but says things may be financially difficult if she stays with him. Peggy's smile expresses her joy and she and Fred kiss.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Myrna Loy as Milly Stephenson\nCasting brought together established stars as well as character actors and relative unknowns. Jazz drummer Gene Krupa was seen in archival footage, while Tennessee Ernie Ford, later a TV star, appeared as an uncredited \"hillbilly singer\" (in the first of his only three film appearances).\nBlake Edwards, later a film producer and director, appeared fleetingly as an uncredited \"Corporal\". Wyler's daughters, Catherine and Judy, were cast as uncredited customers seen in the drug store where Fred Derry works. Sean Penn's father, Leo, played the uncredited part of the soldier working as a scheduling clerk in the Air Transport Command Office at the beginning of the film.\nTeresa Wright was only 13 years younger than her on-screen mother, played by Myrna Loy.\nMichael Hall (1926\u20132020), who played Rob Stephenson, was the last surviving credited cast member at the time of his death. However, he is never seen after the first third of the film. Hall's contract with Goldwyn ended during filming, but the producer was reluctant to pay extra money to rehire him.\nProduction.\nSamuel Goldwyn was inspired to produce a film about veterans after reading an August 7, 1944, article in \"Time\" about the difficulties experienced by men returning to civilian life. Goldwyn hired former war correspondent MacKinlay Kantor to write a screenplay. His work was first published as a novella, \"Glory for Me\", which Kantor wrote in blank verse. Robert E. Sherwood then adapted the novella as a screenplay.\nDirector Wyler had flown combat missions over Europe in filming \"\" (1944), and worked hard to get accurate depictions of the combat veterans he had encountered. Wyler changed the original casting, which had featured a veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, and sought out Harold Russell, a non-actor, to take on the exacting role of Homer Parrish.\nFor \"The Best Years of Our Lives\", he asked the principal actors to purchase their own clothes, in order to connect with daily life and produce an authentic feeling. Other Wyler touches included constructing life-size sets, which went against the standard larger sets that were more suited to camera positions. The impact for the audience was immediate, as each scene played out in a realistic, natural way.\nRecounting the interrelated story of three veterans right after the end of World War II, \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" began filming just over seven months after the war's end, starting on April 15, 1946, at a variety of locations, including the Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden, Ontario International Airport in Ontario, California, Raleigh Studios in Hollywood, and the Samuel Goldwyn/Warner Hollywood Studios.\nIn \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" cinematographer Gregg Toland used deep focus photography, in which objects both close to and distant from the camera are in sharp focus. For the passage of Fred Derry's reliving a combat mission while sitting in the remains of a former bomber, Wyler used \"zoom\" effects to simulate Derry's subjective state.\nThe fictional Boone City was patterned after Cincinnati, Ohio. The \"Jackson High\" football stadium seen early in aerial footage of the bomber flying over the Boone City is Corcoran Stadium located at Xavier University in Cincinnati. A few seconds later Walnut Hills High School with its dome and football field can be seen along with the downtown Cincinnati skyline (Carew Tower and Fourth and Vine Tower) in the background.\nAfter the war, the combat aircraft featured in the film were being destroyed and disassembled for reuse as scrap material. The scene of Derry's walking among aircraft ruins was filmed at the Ontario Army Air Field in Ontario, California. The former training facility had been converted into a scrap yard, housing nearly 2,000 former combat aircraft in various states of disassembly and reclamation.\nReception.\nCritical response.\nUpon its release, \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" received extremely positive reviews from critics. Shortly after its premiere at the Astor Theater, New York, Bosley Crowther, film critic for \"The New York Times\", hailed the film as a masterpiece. He wrote,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is seldom that there comes a motion picture which can be wholly and enthusiastically endorsed not only as superlative entertainment, but as food for quiet and humanizing thought... In working out their solutions, Mr. Sherwood and Mr. Wyler have achieved some of the most beautiful and inspiring demonstrations of human fortitude that we have had in films.\" He also said the ensemble casting gave the \"'best' performance in this best film this year from Hollywood\".\nFrench film critic Andr\u00e9 Bazin used examples of Toland's and Wyler's deep-focus visual style to illuminate his theory of realism in film\u2014going into detail about the scene in which Fred uses the phone booth in the far background while Homer and Butch play piano in the foreground. Bazin explains how deep focus functions in this scene:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nProfessor and author Gabriel Miller discusses briefly the use of deep-focus in both the bar scene and the wedding scene at the end of the picture in an article written for the National Film Preservation Board. From \"The Nation\" in 1946, critic James Agee wrote, \"In fact, it would be possible, I don't doubt, to call the whole picture just one long pious piece of deceit and self-deceit, embarrassed by hot flashes of talent, conscience, truthfulness, and dignity. And it is anyhow more than possible, it is unhappily obligatory, to observe that a good deal which might have been very fine, even great, and which is handled mainly by people who could have done, and done perfectly, all the best that could have been developed out of the idea, is here either murdered in its cradle or reduced to manageable good citizenship in the early stages of grade school. Yet I feel a hundred times more liking and admiration for the film than distaste or disappointment.\"\nSeveral decades later, film critic David Thomson offered tempered praise: \"I would concede that \"Best Years\" is decent and humane... acutely observed, despite being so meticulous a package. It would have taken uncommon genius and daring at that time to sneak a view of an untidy or unresolved America past Goldwyn or the public.\" Pauline Kael wrote, \"Despite its seven Academy Awards, it's not a great picture; it's too schematic and it drags on after you get the points. However, episodes and details stand out and help to compensate for the soggy plot strands and there's something absorbing about the banality of its large-scale good intentions; it's compulsively watchable.\"\n\"The Best Years of Our Lives\" has a 97% \"Fresh\" rating at Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 8.9/10, based on 97 reviews. The critical consensus states: \"An engrossing look at the triumphs and travails of war veterans, \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" is concerned specifically with the aftermath of World War II, but its messages speak to the overall American experience.\" On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 93 out of 100 based on 17 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\n\"Chicago Sun-Times\" film critic Roger Ebert put the film on his \"Great Movies\" list in 2007, calling it \"... modern, lean, and honest\".\nPopular response.\n\"The Best Years of Our Lives\" was a massive commercial success. It opened to the public at the Astor Theatre in New York City on November 22, 1946, and grossed $52,236 in its first week. Its length restricted the film to six shows a day, cutting down on total ticket sales, and initially suffered by having a top midweek ticket price of $2.40, reducing gross revenue. It opened at the Woods Theatre in Chicago on December 18 before a roadshow theatrical release in Boston and Los Angeles, starting on the evening of Christmas Day. After 12 weeks at the Astor, the film had grossed $584,000 and at that point had grossed $1.37 million from 6 theatres in five cities from 45 play weeks.\nThe picture earned $7.65 million in theatrical rentals at the U.S. and Canadian box office during its initial theatrical run, ultimately benefiting from much larger admission prices (reflecting its exceptional length) than the majority of films released that year, which accounted for almost 70% of its earnings. When box office figures are adjusted for inflation, it remains one of the top 100 grossing films in U.S. history.\nAmong films released before 1950, only \"Gone With the Wind\", \"The Bells of St. Mary's\", \"The Big Parade\" and four Disney titles have done more total business, in part due to later re-releases. (Reliable box office figures for certain early films such as \"The Birth of a Nation\" and Charlie Chaplin's comedies are unavailable.)\nHowever, because of the distribution arrangement RKO had with Goldwyn, RKO recorded a loss of $660,000 on the film.\nAwards and honors.\nIn spite of his role, Harold Russell was not a professional actor. As the Academy Board of Governors considered him a long shot to win the Best Supporting Actor Oscar he had been nominated for, they gave him an Academy Honorary Award \"for bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans through his appearance\". When Russell in fact won as supporting actor there was an enthusiastic response. He is the only actor to have received two Academy Awards for the same performance. In 1992, Russell sold his Best Supporting Actor statuette at auction for $60,500 ($ today), to pay his wife's medical bills.\nRadio adaptations.\nThe picture received four half-hour radio adaptations during 1947 and 1949: on Hedda Hopper's \"This Is Hollywood\", \"The Screen Guild Theater\" (two) and \"Screen Directors Playhouse\". In each case various actors reprised their film roles.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "42160", "revid": "49089944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42160", "title": "Beaverton, Oregon", "text": "Beaverton is a city in the Tualatin Valley, located in Washington County in the U.S. state of Oregon, with a small portion bordering Portland. The city is among the main cities that make up the Portland metropolitan area. Its population was 97,494 at the 2020 census, making it the second most populous city in the county and the seventh-most populous city in Oregon. Beaverton is an economic center for Washington County along with neighboring Hillsboro.\nHistory.\nEarly settlement.\nAccording to \"Oregon Geographic Names\", Beaverton's name is derived from the settlement's proximity to a large body of water resulting from beaver dams.\nThe area of Tualatin Valley that became Beaverton was originally the home of a Native American tribe known as the \"Atfalati\", which settlers mispronounced as \"Tualatin\". The Atfalati population dwindled in the latter part of the 18th century, and the prosperous tribe was no longer dominant in the area by the 19th century when settlers arrived. The tribe named their village Chakeipi, which translates to \"place of the beaver\", which early settlers referred to as \"Beaverdam.\"\nEarly settlers include the Hall Family from Kentucky, the Denneys who lived on their claim near present-day Scholls Ferry Road and Hall Blvd, and Orin S. Allen, from western New York. Lawrence Hall purchased in Beaverdam in 1847 and built a grist mill with his brother near present-day Walker Road. His was the first land claim in the area. He was soon followed by Thomas Denney in 1848, who came to the area and built its first sawmill. In 1860, a toll plank road from Portland to Beaverton was completed over a trail called Canyon Road.\nAfter the American Civil War, numerous other settlers, including Joshua Welch, George Betts, Charles Angel, W. P. Watson, and John Henry, laid out what is now known as Beaverton hoping they could bring a railroad to an area once described as, \"mostly swamps &amp; marshes connected by beaver dams to create what looked like a huge lake.\" In 1872, Beaverton's first post office opened in a general store operated by Betts, who also served as the first postmaster of the community. Betts Street, where the current post office now stands, is named in honor of him. In 1893, Beaverton, which by that time had a population of 400, was officially incorporated. Alonzo Cady, a local businessman, served as the first mayor. Many major roads in Beaverton are named for these early settlers.\n20th century.\nBeaverton was an early home to automobile dealerships. A Ford Motor Company dealership was established there in 1915; it was purchased by Guy Carr in 1923 and over the years Carr expanded it into several locations throughout Beaverton. There are still several dealerships near the intersection of Walker and Canyon Roads.\nIn the early 1920s, Beaverton was home to Premium Picture Productions, a movie studio which produced about fifteen films. The studio site was later converted into Watt's Field and associated aircraft manufacturing facilities. A second Beaverton airport, Bernard's Airport, was later developed farther north, at the present location of the Cedar Hills Crossing mall.\nThe town's first library opened in 1925. Originally on the second floor of the Cady building, it has been moved repeatedly; in 2000 it was moved to its current location on Hall Boulevard and 5th Street. A branch location was opened for the first time in June 2010, when the Murray-Scholls location opened near the Murrayhill neighborhood. The Beaverton libraries and 15 other local libraries participate in the Washington County Cooperative Library Services.\n21st century.\nIn December 2004, the city and Washington County announced an \"interim plan\" which would lead to Beaverton becoming the second-largest city in Oregon, second only to Portland. The \"interim\" plan actually covered a period of more than ten years; from the county's perspective, the plan supported its strategy of having cities and special districts provide urban services. The city of Beaverton also attempted to annex certain businesses, including Nike, which responded with a legal and lobbying effort to resist the annexation. The lobbying effort succeeded quickly, with the Oregon Legislative Assembly enacting Senate Bill 887, which prohibited Beaverton from annexing Nike without the company's consent. The bill also applied to property owned by Electro Scientific Industries, Columbia Sportswear, and Tektronix, and in August 2008 the Oregon Land Use Board of Appeals ruled that the bill also barred the city from annexing property belonging to Leupold &amp; Stevens. (See below, under Economy.) Beaverton's legal efforts to annex Nike cost the city over one million dollars.\nThe Oregon State Legislature has also passed legislation which redetermined Washington County's urban growth boundary to include more development. In 2018, the Metro Council voted to once again expand the urban growth boundary to include the Cooper Mountain urban reserve area.\nIn 2016, voters approved a $35\u00a0million bond for a new Public Safety Center built to withstand a major earthquake. The center, which opened in fall of 2020, now houses the city's Emergency Management and Police Departments. Construction began in September 2018.\nThe city has tried to encourage transit-oriented development around the city's MAX Light Rail stations. The Round, a mixed-use development around Beaverton Central MAX Station on the site of a former sewer plant, was announced in 1996. In 2014, the City of Beaverton moved its city hall into The Beaverton Building, an office building in The Round. The Round currently consists of 24,000 square foot of retail space with 63 residential condominiums located above. BG's Food Cartel, Beaverton's first food cart pod, opened in 2018 and has 31 food carts, a speakeasy bar, and an event venue. Adjacent to The Round, the 550 seat Patricia Reser Center for the Arts opened in 2022, and was made possible by pledges from the Beaverton Arts Foundation and Pat Reser along with public sources. The groundbreaking was performed on November 13, 2019. In addition to the Reser Center, a new 125-room hotel opened next to The Round in February 2021. The performing arts center, apartments, city hall, hotel, MAX light rail station, plazas, food carts, and nearby businesses are collectively known as Downtown Beaverton.\nGeography.\nBeaverton covers a total area of , all of it land except for small creeks, ponds, and lakes. The city is located along the eastern edge of the Tualatin Valley just west of the Tualatin Mountains. It is bordered by Portland to the east, Hillsboro to the west, and Tigard to the south. Much of the remaining area surrounding Beaverton in the north and southwest constitutes unincorporated Washington County land. The elevation within city limits ranges from as high as above sea level to as low as above sea level. The city averages at above sea level.\nNeighborhoods.\nThe city of Beaverton is divided into 13 neighborhoods: Central Beaverton, Denney Whitford, Raleigh West, Five Oaks, Triple Creek, Greenway, Highland, Neighbors Southwest, Sexton Mountain, South Beaverton, Vose, West Beaverton, and West Slope. Each neighborhood runs a Neighborhood Association Committee (NAC) to discuss neighborhood affairs, with the exception of Five Oaks and Triple Creek, and Denney Whitford and Raleigh West each sharing a NAC.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2020 Census.\nAs of the census of 2020, there were 97,494 people.\nThe racial makeup of the city was 59% Non-Hispanic White, 2.9% African American, 1.0% Native American, 12.2% Asian, 0.5% Pacific Islander, 8.7% from other races, and 12.5% from two or more races.

Hall/Nimbus, the second station southbound on WES, is also located in Beaverton. Intercity bus services with stops in Beaverton include POINT and TCTD.\nOregon Electric and Red Electric interurban lines once served the city in the early 20th century. In the 1940s, Tualatin Valley Stages, a division of Portland Stages, Inc., provided limited bus transit service between the city and downtown Portland; it operated later as a separate company, Tualatin Valley Buses, Inc., through the 1960s. This was one of four privately owned bus companies that served the Portland metropolitan area and were collectively known as the \"Blue Bus\" lines. All four companies were replaced in 1970 by TriMet, which expanded bus service to cover more areas of Beaverton.\nThe city is the location of a major freeway interchange for U.S. Route 26 (US 26; Sunset Highway) and Oregon Route 217 (OR 217). The Sunset Highway connects Beaverton to Hillsboro and the Oregon Coast to the west and Portland to the east.

The term commonly refers to any form of financial instrument, but its legal definition varies by jurisdiction. In some countries and languages people commonly use the term \"security\" to refer to any form of financial instrument, even though the underlying legal and regulatory regime may not have such a broad definition. In some jurisdictions the term specifically excludes financial instruments other than equity and fixed income instruments. In some jurisdictions it includes some instruments that are close to equities and fixed income, e.g., equity warrants.\nSecurities may be represented by a certificate or, more typically, they may be \"non-certificated\", that is in electronic (dematerialized) or \"book entry only\" form. Certificates may be \"bearer\", meaning they entitle the holder to rights under the security merely by holding the security, or \"registered\", meaning they entitle the holder to rights only if they appear on a security register maintained by the issuer or an intermediary. They include shares of corporate capital stock or mutual funds, bonds issued by corporations or governmental agencies, stock options or other options, limited partnership units, and various other formal investment instruments that are negotiable and fungible.\nUnited Kingdom and United States.\nIn the United Kingdom, the Financial Conduct Authority functions as the national competent authority for the regulation of financial markets; the definition in its \"Handbook\" of the term \"security\" applies only to equities, debentures, alternative debentures, government and public securities, warrants, certificates representing certain securities, units, stakeholder pension schemes, personal pension schemes, rights to or interests in investments, and anything that may be admitted to the Official List.\nIn the United States, a \"security\" is a tradable financial asset of any kind. Securities can be broadly categorized into:\nThe company or other entity issuing the security is called the issuer. A country's regulatory structure determines what qualifies as a security. For example, private investment pools may have some features of securities, but they may not be registered or regulated as such if they meet various restrictions.\nSecurities are the traditional method used by commercial enterprises to raise new capital. They may offer an attractive alternative to bank loans - depending on their pricing and market demand for particular characteristics. A disadvantage of bank loans as a source of financing is that the bank may seek a measure of protection against default by the borrower via extensive financial covenants. Through securities, capital is provided by investors who purchase the securities upon their initial issuance. In a similar way, a government may issue securities when it chooses to increase government debt.\nDebt and equity.\nSecurities are traditionally divided into debt securities and equities.\nDebt.\nDebt securities may be called debentures, bonds, deposits, notes or commercial paper depending on their maturity, collateral and other characteristics. The holder of a debt security is typically entitled to the payment of principal and interest, together with other contractual rights under the terms of the issue, such as the right to receive certain information. Debt securities are generally issued for a fixed term and redeemable by the issuer at the end of that term. Debt securities may be protected by collateral or may be unsecured, and, if they are unsecured, may be contractually \"senior\" to other unsecured debt meaning their holders would have a priority in a bankruptcy of the issuer. Debt that is not senior is \"subordinated\".\nCorporate bonds represent the debt of commercial or industrial entities. Debentures have a long maturity, typically at least ten years, whereas notes have a shorter maturity. Commercial paper is a simple form of debt security that essentially represents a post-dated cheque with a maturity of not more than 270 days.\nMoney market instruments are short term debt instruments that may have characteristics of deposit accounts, such as certificates of deposit, Accelerated Return Notes (ARN), and certain bills of exchange. They are highly liquid and are sometimes referred to as \"near cash\". Commercial paper is also often highly liquid.\nEuro debt securities are securities issued internationally outside their domestic market in a denomination different from that of the issuer's domicile. They include eurobonds and euronotes. Eurobonds are characteristically underwritten, and not secured, and interest is paid gross. A euronote may take the form of euro-commercial paper (ECP) or euro-certificates of deposit.\nGovernment bonds are medium or long term debt securities issued by sovereign governments or their agencies. Typically they carry a lower rate of interest than corporate bonds, and serve as a source of finance for governments. U.S. federal government bonds are called \"treasuries.\" Because of their liquidity and perceived low risk, treasuries are used to manage the money supply in the open market operations of non-US central banks.\nSub-sovereign government bonds, known in the U.S. as municipal bonds, represent the debt of state, provincial, territorial, municipal or other governmental units other than sovereign governments.\nSupranational bonds represent the debt of international organizations such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, regional multilateral development banks like the African Development Bank and the Asian Development Bank, and others.\nEquity.\nAn equity security is a share of equity interest in an entity such as the capital stock of a company, trust or partnership. The most common form of equity interest is common stock, although preferred equity is also a form of capital stock. The holder of an equity is a shareholder, owning a share, or fractional part of the issuer. Unlike debt securities, which typically require regular payments (interest) to the holder, equity securities are not entitled to any payment. In bankruptcy, they share only in the residual interest of the issuer after all obligations have been paid out to creditors. However, equity generally entitles the holder to a pro rata portion of control of the company, meaning that a holder of a majority of the equity is usually entitled to control the issuer. Equity also enjoys the right to profits and capital gain, whereas holders of debt securities receive only interest and repayment of principal regardless of how well the issuer performs financially. Furthermore, debt securities do not have voting rights outside of bankruptcy. In other words, equity holders are entitled to the \"upside\" of the business and to control the business.\nHybrid.\nHybrid securities combine some of the characteristics of both debt and equity securities.\nPreference shares form an intermediate class of security between equities and debt. If the issuer is liquidated, preference shareholders have the right to receive interest or a return of capital prior to ordinary shareholders. However, from a legal perspective, preference shares are capital stocks and therefore may entitle the holders to some degree of control depending on whether they carry voting rights.\nConvertibles are bonds or preferred stocks that can be converted, at the election of the holder of the convertibles, into the ordinary shares of the issuing company. The convertibility, however, may be forced if the convertible is a callable bond, and the issuer calls the bond. The bondholder has about one month to convert it, or the company will call the bond by giving the holder the call price, which may be less than the value of the converted stock. This is referred to as a forced conversion.\nEquity warrants are options issued by the company that allow the holder of the warrant to purchase a specific number of shares at a specified price within a specified time. They are often issued together with bonds or existing equities, and are, sometimes, detachable from them and separately tradeable. When the holder of the warrant exercises it, he pays the money directly to the company, and the company issues new shares to the holder.\nWarrants, like other convertible securities, increases the number of shares outstanding, and are always accounted for in financial reports as fully diluted earnings per share, which assumes that all warrants and convertibles will be exercised.\nClassification.\nSecurities may be classified according to many categories or classification systems:\nType of holder.\nInvestors in securities may be retail, i.e., members of the public investing personally, other than by way of business. \nIn distinction, the greatest part of investment in terms of volume, is wholesale, i.e., by financial institutions acting on their own account, or on behalf of clients. \nImportant institutional investors include investment banks, insurance companies, pension funds and other managed funds. \nThe \"wholesaler\" is typically an underwriter or a broker-dealer who trades with other broker-dealers, rather than with the retail investor.\nThis distinction carries over to banking; compare Retail banking and Wholesale banking.\nInvestment.\nThe traditional economic function of the purchase of securities is investment, with the view to receiving income or achieving capital gain. Debt securities generally offer a higher rate of interest than bank deposits, and equities may offer the prospect of capital growth. Equity investment may also offer control of the business of the issuer. Debt holdings may also offer some measure of control to the investor if the company is a fledgling start-up or an old giant undergoing restructuring. In these cases, if interest payments are missed, the creditors may take control of the company and liquidate it to recover some of their investment.\nCollateral.\nThe last decade has seen an enormous growth in the use of securities as collateral. Purchasing securities with borrowed money secured by other securities or cash itself is called \"buying on margin\". Where A is owed a debt or other obligation by B, A may require B to deliver property rights in securities to A, either at inception (transfer of title) or only in default (non-transfer-of-title institutional). For institutional loans, property rights are not transferred but nevertheless enable A to satisfy its claims in case B fails to make good on its obligations to A or otherwise becomes insolvent. Collateral arrangements are divided into two broad categories, namely security interests and outright collateral transfers. Commonly, commercial banks, investment banks, government agencies and other institutional investors such as mutual funds are significant collateral takers as well as providers. In addition, private parties may utilize stocks or other securities as collateral for portfolio loans in securities lending scenarios.\nOn the consumer level, loans against securities have grown into three distinct groups over the last decade:\nOf the three, transfer-of-title loans have fallen into the very high-risk category as the number of providers has dwindled as regulators have launched an industry-wide crackdown on transfer-of-title structures where the private lender may sell or sell short the securities to fund the loan. Institutionally managed consumer securities-based loans on the other hand, draw loan funds from the financial resources of the lending institution, not from the sale of the securities.\nCollateral and sources of collateral are changing, in 2012 gold became a more acceptable form of collateral. By 2015, recently Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) previously seen by many as unpromising had started to become more readily available and acceptable.\nMarkets.\nPrimary and secondary market.\nPublic securities markets are either primary or secondary markets. In the primary market, the money for the securities is received by the issuer of the securities from investors, typically in an initial public offering (IPO). In the secondary market, the securities are simply assets held by one investor selling them to another investor, with the money going from one investor to the other.\nAn initial public offering is when a company issues public stock newly to investors, called an \"IPO\" for short. A company can later issue more new shares, or issue shares that have been previously registered in a shelf registration. These later new issues are also sold in the primary market, but they are not considered to be an IPO, and are often called a \"secondary offering\". Issuers usually retain investment banks to assist them in administering the IPO, obtaining regulatory approval of the offering filing, and selling the new issue. When the investment bank buys the entire new issue from the issuer at a discount to resell it at a markup, it is called a firm commitment underwriting. However, if the investment bank considers the risk too great for an underwriting, it may only assent to a best effort agreement, where the investment bank will simply do its best to sell the new issue.\nFor the primary market to thrive, there must be a secondary market, or aftermarket that provides liquidity for the investment security\u2014where holders of securities can sell them to other investors for cash. Otherwise, few people would purchase primary issues, and, thus, companies and governments would be restricted in raising equity capital (money) for their operations. Organized exchanges constitute the main secondary markets. Many smaller issues and most debt securities trade in the decentralized, dealer-based over-the-counter markets.\nIn Europe, the principal trade organization for securities dealers is the International Capital Market Association. In the U.S., the principal trade organization for securities dealers is the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, which is the result of the merger of the Securities Industry Association and the Bond Market Association. The Financial Information Services Division of the Software and Information Industry Association (FISD/SIIA) represents a round-table of market data industry firms, referring to them as Consumers, Exchanges, and Vendors. In India the equivalent organisation is the securities exchange board of India (SEBI).\nPublic offer and private placement.\nIn the primary markets, securities may be offered to the public in a public offering. Alternatively, they may be offered privately to a limited number of qualified persons in a private placement. Sometimes a combination of the two is used. The distinction between the two is important to securities regulation and company law. Privately placed securities are not publicly tradable and may only be bought and sold by sophisticated qualified investors. As a result, the secondary market is not nearly as liquid as it is for public (registered) securities.\nAnother category, sovereign bonds, is generally sold by auction to a specialized class of dealers.\nListing and over-the-counter dealing.\nSecurities are often listed in a stock exchange, an organized and officially recognized market on which securities can be bought and sold. Issuers may seek listings for their securities to attract investors, by ensuring there is a liquid and regulated market that investors can buy and sell securities in.\nGrowth in informal electronic trading systems has challenged the traditional business of stock exchanges. Large volumes of securities are also bought and sold \"over the counter\" (OTC). OTC dealing involves buyers and sellers dealing with each other by telephone or electronically on the basis of prices that are displayed electronically, usually by financial data vendors such as SuperDerivatives, Reuters, Investing.com and Bloomberg.\nThere are also eurosecurities, which are securities that are issued outside their domestic market into more than one jurisdiction. They are generally listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or admitted to listing in London. The reasons for listing eurobonds include regulatory and tax considerations, as well as the investment restrictions.\nSecurities services.\nSecurities Services refers to the products and services that are offered to institutional clients that issue, trade, and hold securities. The bank engaged in securities services are usually called a custodian bank. Market players include BNY Mellon, J.P. Morgan, HSBC, Citi, BNP Paribas, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale etc.\nMarket.\nLondon is the centre of the eurosecurities markets. There was a huge rise in the eurosecurities market in London in the early 1980s. Settlement of trades in eurosecurities is currently effected through two international central securities depositories, namely Euroclear Bank (in Belgium) and Clearstream Banking SA (formerly Cedel, in Luxembourg).\nThe main market for Eurobonds is the EuroMTS, owned by Borsa Italiana and Euronext. There are ramp up market in Emergent countries, but it is growing slowly.\nPhysical nature.\nCertificated securities.\nSecurities that are represented in paper (physical) form are called certificated securities. They may be \"bearer\" or \"registered\".\nDRS securities.\nSecurities may also be held in the Direct Registration System (DRS), which is a method of recording shares of stock in book-entry form. Book-entry means the company's transfer agent maintains the shares on the owner's behalf without the need for physical share certificates. Shares held in un-certificated book-entry form have the same rights and privileges as shares held in certificated form.\nBearer securities.\nBearer securities are completely negotiable and entitle the holder to the rights under the security (e.g., to payment if it is a debt security, and voting if it is an equity security). They are transferred by delivering the instrument from person to person. In some cases, transfer is by endorsement, or signing the back of the instrument, and delivery.\nRegulatory and fiscal authorities sometimes regard bearer securities negatively, as they may be used to facilitate the evasion of regulatory restrictions and tax. In the United Kingdom, for example, the issue of bearer securities was heavily restricted firstly by the \"Exchange Control Act\" 1947 until 1953. Bearer securities are very rare in the United States because of the negative tax implications they may have to the issuer and holder.\nIn Luxembourg, the law of 28 July 2014 concerning the compulsory deposit and immobilization of shares and units in bearer form adopts the compulsory deposit and immobilization of bearer shares and units with a depositary allowing identification of the holders thereof.\nRegistered securities.\nIn the case of registered securities, certificates bearing the name of the holder are issued, but these merely represent the securities. A person does not automatically acquire legal ownership by having possession of the certificate. Instead, the issuer (or its appointed agent) maintains a register in which details of the holder of the securities are entered and updated as appropriate. A transfer of registered securities is effected by amending the register.\nNon-certificated securities and global certificates.\nModern practice has developed to eliminate both the need for certificates and maintenance of a complete security register by the issuer. There are two general ways this has been accomplished.\nNon-certificated securities.\nIn some jurisdictions, such as France, it is possible for issuers of that jurisdiction to maintain a legal record of their securities electronically.\nIn the United States, the current \"official\" version of Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code permits non-certificated securities. However, the \"official\" UCC is a mere draft that must be enacted individually by each U.S. state. Though all 50 states (as well as the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands) have enacted some form of Article 8, many of them still appear to use older versions of Article 8, including some that did not permit non-certificated securities.\nGlobal certificates, book entry interests, depositories.\nTo facilitate the electronic transfer of interests in securities without dealing with inconsistent versions of Article 8, a system has developed whereby issuers deposit a single global certificate representing all the outstanding securities of a class or series with a universal depository. This depository is called The Depository Trust Company, or DTC. DTC's parent, Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC), is a non-profit cooperative owned by approximately thirty of the largest Wall Street players that typically act as brokers or dealers in securities. These thirty banks are called the DTC participants. DTC, through a legal nominee, owns each of the global securities on behalf of all the DTC participants.\nAll securities traded through DTC are in fact held, in electronic form, on the books of various intermediaries between the ultimate owner, e.g., a retail investor, and the DTC participants. For example, Mr. Smith may hold 100 shares of Coca-Cola, Inc. in his brokerage account at local broker Jones &amp; Co. brokers. In turn, Jones &amp; Co. may hold 1000 shares of Coca-Cola on behalf of Mr. Smith and nine other customers. These 1000 shares are held by Jones &amp; Co. in an account with Goldman Sachs, a DTC participant, or in an account at another DTC participant. Goldman Sachs in turn may hold millions of Coca-Cola shares on its books on behalf of hundreds of brokers similar to Jones &amp; Co. Each day, the DTC participants settle their accounts with the other DTC participants and adjust the number of shares held on their books for the benefit of customers like Jones &amp; Co. Ownership of securities in this fashion is called beneficial ownership. Each intermediary holds on behalf of someone beneath him in the chain. The ultimate owner is called the beneficial owner. This is also referred to as owning in \"Street name\".\nAmong brokerages and mutual fund companies, a large amount of mutual fund share transactions take place among intermediaries as opposed to shares being sold and redeemed directly with the transfer agent of the fund. Most of these intermediaries such as brokerage firms clear the shares electronically through the National Securities Clearing Corp. or \"NSCC\", a subsidiary of DTCC.\nOther depositories.\nBesides DTC in the US, central securities depositories (CSDs) exist on a national basis in most jurisdictions. In addition, two major international CSDs exist, both based in Europe, namely Euroclear Bank and Clearstream Banking SA.\nDivided and undivided security.\nThe terms \"divided\" and \"undivided\" relate to the proprietary nature of a security.\nEach divided security constitutes a separate asset, which is legally distinct from each other security in the same issue. Pre-electronic bearer securities were divided. Each instrument constitutes the separate covenant of the issuer and is a separate debt.\nWith undivided securities, the entire issue makes up one single asset, with each of the securities being a fractional part of this undivided whole. Shares in the secondary markets are always undivided. The issuer owes only one set of obligations to shareholders under its memorandum, articles of association and company law. A share represents an undivided fractional part of the issuing company. Registered debt securities also have this undivided nature.\nFungible and non-fungible securities.\nIn a fungible security, all holdings of the security are treated identically and are interchangeable.\nSometimes securities are not fungible with other securities, for example different series of bonds issued by the same company at different times with different conditions attaching to them.\nRegulation.\nIn the US, the public offer and sale of securities must be either registered pursuant to a registration statement that is filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or are offered and sold pursuant to an exemption therefrom. Dealing in securities is regulated by both federal authorities (SEC) and state securities departments. In addition, the brokerage industry is supposedly self policed by self-regulatory organizations (SROs), such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), formerly the National Association of Securities Dealers (or NASD), or the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB).\nWith respect to investment schemes that do not fall within the traditional categories of securities listed in the definition of a security (Sec. 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sec. 3(a)(10) of the 34 act) the US Courts have developed a broad definition for securities that must then be registered with the SEC. When determining if there is an \"investment contract\" that must be registered the courts look for an investment of money, a common enterprise and expectation of profits to come primarily from the efforts of others.

{"id": "42168", "revid": "11677590", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42168", "title": "Data communication", "text": "Transfer of data over a communication channel\nData communication is the transfer of data over a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint communication channel. Data communication comprises data transmission and data reception and can be classified as analog transmission and digital communications.\"\nAnalog data communication conveys voice, data, image, signal or video information using a continuous signal, which varies in amplitude, phase, or some other property. In baseband analog transmission, messages are represented by a sequence of pulses by means of a line code; in passband analog transmission, they are communicated by a limited set of continuously varying waveforms, using a digital modulation method. Passband modulation and demodulation is carried out by modem equipment.\nDigital transmission and digital reception are the transfer of either a digitized analog signal or a born-digital bitstream. Baseband digital transmission is regarded as comprising part of a digital signal, whereas passband transmission of digital data may also or alternatively be considered a form of digital-to-analog conversion.\nData communication channels include copper wires, optical fibers, wireless communication using radio spectrum, storage media and computer buses. The data are represented as an electromagnetic signal, such as an electrical voltage, radiowave, microwave, or infrared signal.\nDistinction between related subjects.\nDigital transmission or data transmission traditionally belongs to telecommunications and electrical engineering. Basic principles of data transmission may also be covered within the computer science or computer engineering topic of data communications, which also includes computer networking applications and communication protocols, for example routing, switching and inter-process communication. Although the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) involves transmission, TCP and other transport layer protocols are covered in computer networking but \"not\" discussed in a textbook or course about data transmission.\nIn most textbooks, the term analog transmission only refers to the transmission of an analog message signal (without digitization) by means of an analog signal, either as a non-modulated baseband signal or as a passband signal using an analog modulation method such as AM or FM. It may also include analog-over-analog pulse modulated baseband signals such as pulse-width modulation. In a few books within the computer networking tradition, \"analog transmission\" also refers to passband transmission of bit-streams using digital modulation methods such as FSK, PSK and ASK.\nThe theoretical aspects of data transmission are covered by information theory and coding theory.\nProtocol layers and sub-topics.\nCourses and textbooks in the field of data transmission typically deal with the following OSI model protocol layers and topics:\nIt is also common to deal with the cross-layer design of those three layers.\nApplications and history.\nData (mainly but not exclusively informational) has been sent via non-electronic (e.g. optical, acoustic, mechanical) means since the advent of communication. Analog signal data has been sent electronically since the advent of the telephone. However, the first data electromagnetic transmission applications in modern time were electrical telegraphy (1809) and teletypewriters (1906), which are both digital signals. The fundamental theoretical work in data transmission and information theory by Harry Nyquist, Ralph Hartley, Claude Shannon and others during the early 20th century, was done with these applications in mind.\nIn the early 1960s, Paul Baran invented \"distributed adaptive message block switching\" for digital communication of voice messages using switches that were low-cost electronics. Donald Davies invented and implemented modern data communication during 1965\u20137, including packet switching, high-speed routers, communication protocols, hierarchical computer networks and the essence of the end-to-end principle. Baran's work did not include routers with software switches and communication protocols, nor the idea that users, rather than the network itself, would provide the reliability. Both were seminal contributions that influenced the development of computer networks.\nData transmission is utilized in computers in computer buses and for communication with peripheral equipment via parallel ports and serial ports such as RS-232 (1969), FireWire (1995) and USB (1996). The principles of data transmission are also utilized in storage media for error detection and correction since 1951. The first practical method to overcome the problem of receiving data accurately by the receiver using digital code was the Barker code invented by Ronald Hugh Barker in 1952 and published in 1953. Data transmission is utilized in computer networking equipment such as modems (1940), local area network (LAN) adapters (1964), repeaters, repeater hubs, microwave links, wireless network access points (1997), etc.\nIn telephone networks, digital communication is utilized for transferring many phone calls over the same copper cable or fiber cable by means of pulse-code modulation (PCM) in combination with time-division multiplexing (TDM) (1962). Telephone exchanges have become digital and software controlled, facilitating many value-added services. For example, the first AXE telephone exchange was presented in 1976. Digital communication to the end user using Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) services became available in the late 1980s. Since the end of the 1990s, broadband access techniques such as ADSL, Cable modems, fiber-to-the-building (FTTB) and fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) have become widespread to small offices and homes. The current tendency is to replace traditional telecommunication services with packet mode communication such as IP telephony and IPTV.\nTransmitting analog signals digitally allows for greater signal processing capability. The ability to process a communications signal means that errors caused by random processes can be detected and corrected. Digital signals can also be sampled instead of continuously monitored. The multiplexing of multiple digital signals is much simpler compared to the multiplexing of analog signals. Because of all these advantages, because of the vast demand to transmit computer data and the ability of digital communications to do so and because recent advances in wideband communication channels and solid-state electronics have allowed engineers to realize these advantages fully, digital communications have grown quickly.\nThe digital revolution has also resulted in many digital telecommunication applications where the principles of data transmission are applied. Examples include second-generation (1991) and later cellular telephony, video conferencing, digital TV (1998), digital radio (1999), and telemetry.\nData transmission, digital transmission or digital communications is the transfer of data over a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint communication channel. Examples of such channels include copper wires, optical fibers, wireless communication channels, storage media and computer buses. The data are represented as an electromagnetic signal, such as an electrical voltage, radio wave, microwave, or infrared light.\nWhile analog transmission is the transfer of a continuously varying analog signal over an analog channel, digital communication is the transfer of discrete messages over a digital or an analog channel. The messages are either represented by a sequence of pulses by means of a line code (baseband transmission), or by a limited set of continuously varying waveforms (passband transmission), using a digital modulation method. The passband modulation and corresponding demodulation (also known as detection) is carried out by modem equipment. According to the most common definition of a digital signal, both baseband and passband signals representing bit-streams are considered as digital transmission, while an alternative definition only considers the baseband signal as digital, and passband transmission of digital data as a form of digital-to-analog conversion.\nData transmitted may be digital messages originating from a data source, for example, a computer or a keyboard. It may also be an analog signal, such as a phone call or a video signal, digitized into a bit-stream for example using pulse-code modulation (PCM) or more advanced source coding (analog-to-digital conversion and data compression) schemes. This source coding and decoding is carried out by codec equipment.\nSerial and parallel transmission.\nIn telecommunications, serial transmission is the sequential transmission of signal elements of a group representing a character or other entity of data. Digital serial transmissions are bits sent over a single wire, frequency or optical path sequentially. Because it requires less signal processing and fewer chances for error than parallel transmission, the transfer rate of each individual path may be faster. This can be used over longer distances, and a check digit or parity bit can be sent along with the data easily.\nParallel transmission is the simultaneous transmission of related signal elements over two or more separate paths. Multiple electrical wires are used that can transmit multiple bits simultaneously, which allows for higher data transfer rates than can be achieved with serial transmission. This method is typically used internally within the computer, for example, the internal buses, and sometimes externally for such things as printers. Timing skew can be a significant issue in these systems because the wires in parallel data transmission unavoidably have slightly different properties, so some bits may arrive before others, which may corrupt the message. This issue tends to worsen with distance, making parallel data transmission less reliable for long distances.\nCommunication channels.\nSome communications channel types include:\nAsynchronous and synchronous data transmission.\nAsynchronous serial communication uses start and stop bits to signify the beginning and end of transmission. This method of transmission is used when data is sent intermittently as opposed to in a solid stream.\nSynchronous transmission synchronizes transmission speeds at both the receiving and sending end of the transmission using clock signals. The clock may be a separate signal or embedded in the data. A continual stream of data is then sent between the two nodes. Due to there being no start and stop bits, the data transfer rate may be more efficient.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "42169", "revid": "92899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42169", "title": "Dual number", "text": "Real numbers adjoined with a nil-squaring element\nIn algebra, the dual numbers are a quadratic algebra first introduced in the 19th century. They are expressions of the form \"a\" + \"b\u03b5\", where a and b are real numbers, and \u03b5 is a symbol taken to satisfy formula_1 with formula_2.\nDual numbers can be added component-wise, and multiplied by the formula\n formula_3\nwhich follows from the property \"\u03b5\"2 = 0 and the fact that multiplication is a bilinear operation.\nThe dual numbers form a commutative algebra of dimension two over the reals, and also an Artinian local ring. They are one of the simplest examples of a ring that has nonzero nilpotent elements.\nHistory.\nDual numbers were introduced in 1873 by William Clifford, and were used at the beginning of the twentieth century by the German mathematician Eduard Study, who used them to represent the dual angle which measures the relative position of two skew lines in space. Study defined a dual angle as \"\u03b8\" + \"d\u03b5\", where \u03b8 is the angle between the directions of two lines in three-dimensional space and d is a distance between them. The n-dimensional generalization, the Grassmann number, was introduced by Hermann Grassmann in the late 19th century.\nModern definition.\nIn modern algebra, the algebra of dual numbers is often defined as the quotient of a polynomial ring over the real numbers formula_4 by the principal ideal generated by the square of the indeterminate, that is\nformula_5\nIt may also be defined as the exterior algebra of a one-dimensional vector space with formula_6 as its basis element.\nDivision.\nDivision of dual numbers is defined when the real part of the denominator is non-zero. The division process is analogous to complex division in that the denominator is multiplied by its conjugate in order to cancel the non-real parts.\nTherefore, to evaluate an expression of the form\nformula_7\nwe multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:\nformula_8\nwhich is defined when c is non-zero.\nIf, on the other hand, c is zero while d is not, then the equation\nformula_9\nThis means that the non-real part of the \"quotient\" is arbitrary and division is therefore not defined for purely nonreal dual numbers. Indeed, they are (trivially) zero divisors and clearly form an ideal of the associative algebra (and thus ring) of the dual numbers.\nMatrix representation.\nThe dual number formula_10 can be represented by the square matrix formula_11. In this representation the matrix formula_12 squares to the zero matrix, corresponding to the dual number formula_6.\nGenerally, if formula_6 is a nilpotent matrix, then \"B\" = {\"x\" I + \"y\" formula_6: \"x, y\" real} is a subalgebra isomorphic to the algebra of dual numbers. In the case of 2x2 real matrices M(2,R), formula_6 can be taken as any matrix of the form formula_17 with \"p\" = \"a\"2 + \"bc\" = 0.\nThe dual numbers are one of three isomorphism classes of real 2-algebras in M(2,R). When \"p\" &gt; 0 the subalgebra \"B\" is isomorphic to split-complex numbers, and when \"p\" &lt; 0, \"B\" is isomorphic to the complex plane.\nAutomatic differentiation.\nOne application of dual numbers is automatic differentiation. Any polynomial\nformula_18\nwith real coefficients can be extended to a function of a dual-number-valued argument,\nformula_19\nwhere formula_20 is the derivative of formula_21\nMore generally, any (analytic) real function can be extended to the dual numbers via its Taylor series:\nformula_22\nsince all terms involving \"\u03b5\"2 or greater powers are trivially 0 by the definition of \u03b5.\nBy computing compositions of these functions over the dual numbers and examining the coefficient of \u03b5 in the result we find we have automatically computed the derivative of the composition.\nA similar method works for polynomials of n variables, using the exterior algebra of an n-dimensional vector space.\nGeometry.\nThe \"unit circle\" of dual numbers consists of those with \"a\" \n \u00b11 since these satisfy \"zz\"* \n 1 where \"z\"* \n \"a\" \u2212 \"b\u03b5\". However, note that\n formula_23\nso the exponential map applied to the \u03b5-axis covers only half the \"circle\".\nLet \"z\" \n \"a\" + \"b\u03b5\". If \"a\" \u2260 0 and \"m\" \n , then \"z\" \n \"a\"(1 + \"m\u03b5\") is the polar decomposition of the dual number z, and the slope m is its angular part. The concept of a \"rotation\" in the dual number plane is equivalent to a vertical shear mapping since (1 + \"p\u03b5\")(1 + \"q\u03b5\") \n 1 + (\"p\" + \"q\")\"\u03b5\".\nIn absolute space and time the Galilean transformation\nformula_24\nthat is\nformula_25\nrelates the resting coordinates system to a moving frame of reference of velocity v. With dual numbers \"t\" + \"x\u03b5\" representing events along one space dimension and time, the same transformation is effected with multiplication by 1 + \"v\u03b5\".\nCycles.\nGiven two dual numbers p and q, they determine the set of z such that the difference in slopes (\"Galilean angle\") between the lines from z to p and q is constant. This set is a cycle in the dual number plane; since the equation setting the difference in slopes of the lines to a constant is a quadratic equation in the real part of z, a cycle is a parabola. The \"cyclic rotation\" of the dual number plane occurs as a motion of its projective line. According to Isaak Yaglom, the cycle \"Z\" \n {\"z\" : \"y\" \n \"\u03b1x\"2} is invariant under the composition of the shear\nformula_26\nwith the translation\nformula_27\nApplications in mechanics.\nDual numbers find applications in mechanics, notably for kinematic synthesis. For example, the dual numbers make it possible to transform the input/output equations of a four-bar spherical linkage, which includes only rotoid joints, into a four-bar spatial mechanism (rotoid, rotoid, rotoid, cylindrical). The dualized angles are made of a primitive part, the angles, and a dual part, which has units of length. See screw theory for more.\nAlgebraic geometry.\nIn modern algebraic geometry, the dual numbers over a field formula_28 (by which we mean the ring formula_29) may be used to define the tangent vectors to the points of a formula_28-scheme. Since the field formula_28 can be chosen intrinsically, it is possible to speak simply of the tangent vectors to a scheme. This allows notions from differential geometry to be imported into algebraic geometry.\nIn detail: The ring of dual numbers may be thought of as the ring of functions on the \"first-order neighborhood of a point\" \u2013 namely, the formula_32-scheme formula_33. Then, given a formula_32-scheme formula_35, formula_32-points of the scheme are in 1-1 correspondence with maps formula_37, while tangent vectors are in 1-1 correspondence with maps formula_38.\nThe field formula_28 above can be chosen intrinsically to be a residue field. To wit: Given a point formula_40 on a scheme formula_41, consider the stalk formula_42. Observe that formula_42 is a local ring with a unique maximal ideal, which is denoted formula_44. Then simply let formula_45.\nGeneralizations.\nThis construction can be carried out more generally: for a commutative ring R one can define the dual numbers over R as the quotient of the polynomial ring \"R\"[\"X\"] by the ideal (\"X\"2): the image of X then has square equal to zero and corresponds to the element \u03b5 from above.\nArbitrary module of elements of zero square.\nThere is a more general construction of the dual numbers. Given a commutative ring formula_46 and a module formula_47, there is a ring formula_48 called the ring of dual numbers which has the following structures:\nIt is the formula_46-module formula_50 with the multiplication defined by formula_51 for formula_52 and formula_53\nThe algebra of dual numbers is the special case where formula_54 and formula_55\nSuperspace.\nDual numbers find applications in physics, where they constitute one of the simplest non-trivial examples of a superspace. Equivalently, they are supernumbers with just one generator; supernumbers generalize the concept to n distinct generators \u03b5, each anti-commuting, possibly taking n to infinity. Superspace generalizes supernumbers slightly, by allowing multiple commuting dimensions.\nThe motivation for introducing dual numbers into physics follows from the Pauli exclusion principle for fermions. The direction along \u03b5 is termed the \"fermionic\" direction, and the real component is termed the \"bosonic\" direction. The fermionic direction earns this name from the fact that fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle: under the exchange of coordinates, the quantum mechanical wave function changes sign, and thus vanishes if two coordinates are brought together; this physical idea is captured by the algebraic relation\u00a0\"\u03b5\"2 \n 0.\nProjective line.\nThe idea of a projective line over dual numbers was advanced by Gr\u00fcnwald and Corrado Segre.\nJust as the Riemann sphere needs a north pole point at infinity to close up the complex projective line, so a line at infinity succeeds in closing up the plane of dual numbers to a cylinder.\nSuppose D is the ring of dual numbers \"x\" + \"y\u03b5\" and U is the subset with \"x\" \u2260 0. Then U is the group of units of D. Let \"B\" \n {(\"a\", \"b\") \u2208 \"D\" \u00d7 \"D\" : \"a\" \u2208 U or \"b\" \u2208 U}. A relation is defined on B as follows: (\"a\", \"b\") ~ (\"c\", \"d\") when there is a u in U such that \"ua\" \n \"c\" and \"ub\" \n \"d\". This relation is in fact an equivalence relation. The points of the projective line over D are equivalence classes in B under this relation: \"P\"(\"D\") \n \"B\"/~.

A member of the Democratic Party, he represented Minnesota in the United States Senate from 1964 to 1976, and was the Democratic nominee in the 1984 presidential election.\nMondale was born in the small municipality of Ceylon, Minnesota, and graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1951 after attending Macalester College. He then served in the U.S. Army during the Korean War before earning a law degree in 1956. He married Joan Mondale, who was the former Joan Adams, in 1955. Working as a lawyer in Minneapolis, Mondale was appointed Minnesota Attorney General in 1960 by Governor Orville Freeman and was elected to a full term as attorney general in 1962 with 60% of the vote. He was appointed to the U.S. Senate by Governor Karl Rolvaag upon the resignation of U.S. senator Hubert Humphrey following Humphrey's election as vice president in 1964. Mondale was elected to a full Senate term in 1966 and reelected in 1972, resigning in 1976 as he prepared to succeed to the vice presidency in 1977. While in the Senate, he supported consumer protection, fair housing, tax reform, and the desegregation of schools; he served on the Church Committee.\nIn 1976, Jimmy Carter, the Democratic presidential nominee, chose Mondale as his vice-presidential running mate. The Carter\u2013Mondale ticket narrowly defeated the Republican ticket of incumbent president Gerald Ford and his running mate Bob Dole from Kansas. The economy worsened during Carter and Mondale's time in office, and they lost the 1980 presidential election in a landslide to Republicans Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. In 1984, Mondale won the Democratic presidential nomination and campaigned for a nuclear freeze, the Equal Rights Amendment, an increase in taxes, and a reduction of U.S. public debt. His vice presidential nominee, U.S. representative Geraldine Ferraro from New York, was the first female vice-presidential nominee of any major party in U.S. history. Mondale and Ferraro lost the election to the incumbents Reagan and Bush, with Reagan winning 49 states and Mondale carrying only his home state of Minnesota and the Washington, D.C. (District of Columbia).\nAfter his defeat, Mondale joined the Minnesota-based law firm Dorsey &amp; Whitney and the National Democratic Institute (1986\u20131993). President Bill Clinton appointed Mondale United States ambassador to Japan in 1993; he retired from that post in 1996. In 2002, Mondale became the last-minute choice of the Minnesota Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor Party to run for Senate after Democratic U.S. Senate member Paul Wellstone was killed in a plane crash less than two weeks before the election. Mondale narrowly lost the race to mayor of Saint Paul, Minnesota Norm Coleman. He then returned to working at Dorsey &amp; Whitney and remained active in the Democratic Party. Mondale later took up a part-time teaching position at the University of Minnesota's Humphrey School of Public Affairs. He died in 2021 from natural causes.\nEarly life.\nWalter Frederick Mondale was born on January 5, 1928, in Ceylon, Minnesota, to Theodore Sigvaard Mondale, a Methodist minister, and his second wife Claribel Hope (n\u00e9e Cowan), a part-time music teacher. Mondale had two full brothers, Clarence, (known as Pete) and William (known as Mort). Their half-brother Lester Mondale became a Unitarian minister. The brothers' paternal grandparents were Norwegian immigrants, with some distant German ancestry, and their paternal grandfather Frederik Mundal had emigrated from Norway with his family in 1856, eventually settling in the southern part of Minnesota in 1864. The surname \"Mondale\" was Americanized from that of Mundal, a valley and village in the Fj\u00e6rland region of Norway. His mother was born in Iowa, the daughter of an immigrant father, Robert Cowan, who was born in Seaforth, Ontario; she was of Scottish and English descent.\nIn his youth, Mondale's family thought the names \"Walter\" and \"Frederick\" were too stilted for a boy, so they called him \"Fritz\", a common German and Scandinavian diminutive form of Friedrich or Frederick. Due to the Great Depression, Mondale grew up in poverty. His family moved from Ceylon to Heron Lake in 1934, and to Elmore in 1937. Throughout his youth, Mondale was influenced heavily by his father's religious beliefs, including support for the civil rights movement. In 1948, his father died of a stroke. Mondale attended public schools and then Macalester College for two years before transferring to the University of Minnesota, from which he graduated \"cum laude\" with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1951.\nAs Mondale could not afford to attend law school, he enlisted in the United States Army in 1951, shortly after graduating. He served with the 3rd Armored Division Artillery at Fort Knox, Kentucky, during the Korean War, first as an armored reconnaissance vehicle crewman, and later as an education programs specialist and associate editor of the unit's newsletter, \"Tanker's Dust\". He attained the rank of corporal and was discharged in 1953. Mondale enrolled at the University of Minnesota Law School, aided by the G.I. Bill, and graduated \"cum laude\" with a Bachelor of Laws in 1956. In law school, he served on the \"Minnesota Law Review\" and as a law clerk for Minnesota Supreme Court Justice Thomas F. Gallagher. In 1955, Mondale married Joan Adams, whom he met on a blind date. He then practiced law in Minneapolis for four years before entering politics.\nEntry into politics.\nMondale became involved in national politics in the 1940s. At age 20, he was visible in Minnesota politics by helping organize Hubert Humphrey's successful Senate campaign in 1948. Humphrey's campaign assigned Mondale to cover the staunchly Republican 2nd district. Mondale, who had grown up in the region, was able to win the district for Humphrey by a comfortable margin. After working with Humphrey, Mondale went on to work on several campaigns for Orville Freeman. Mondale worked on Freeman's unsuccessful 1952 campaign for the governorship as well as his successful campaign in 1954 and his 1958 reelection campaign. In 1960, Freeman appointed Mondale Minnesota Attorney General following the resignation of Miles Lord. At the time he was appointed, Mondale was 32 years old and had been practicing law for four years. He was elected to the post in his own right in 1962.\nDuring his tenure as Minnesota Attorney General, the case \"Gideon v. Wainwright\" (which ultimately established the right of defendants in state courts to have a lawyer) was being heard by the U.S. Supreme Court. When those opposed to the right to counsel organized a friend of the court brief representing several state attorneys general for that position, Mondale organized a countering friend of the court brief from many more state attorneys general, arguing that defendants must be allowed a lawyer. He also continued the investigation of former mayor of Minneapolis Marvin L. Kline and the mismanagement of the Courage Kenny Rehabilitation Institute. At the 1964 Democratic National Convention, Mondale played a major role in the proposed but ultimately unsuccessful compromise by which the national Democratic Party offered the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party two at-large seats. Mondale also served as a member of the President's Consumer Advisory Council from 1960 to 1964.\nU.S. Senate (1964\u20131976).\nOn December 30, 1964, Governor of Minnesota Karl Rolvaag appointed Mondale to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy created by Hubert Humphrey's resignation; Humphrey had stepped down after being elected Vice President of the United States. Mondale was elected to the Senate for the first time in 1966, defeating Republican Party candidate Robert A. Forsythe by a margin of 53.9% to 45.2%.\nIn 1972, Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern from South Dakota offered Mondale an opportunity to be his vice-presidential running mate; he declined. That year, Mondale was re-elected to the U.S. Senate with over 57% of the vote, even as Republican President Richard Nixon carried Minnesota. He served in the 88th United States Congress, the 89th United States Congress, the 90th United States Congress, the 91st United States Congress, the 92nd United States Congress, the 93rd United States Congress, and the 94th United States Congress.\nPolicies.\nMondale worked hard to build up the center of the party on economic and social issues. Unlike his father, a fervent liberal, he was not a crusader for the New Deal. Instead, he realized that the Democratic base (especially ethnic blue-collar workers) was gradually moving to the right, and he worked to keep their support. Mondale showed little or no interest in foreign policy until about 1974, when he realized that some foreign policy knowledge was necessary if he had loftier aspirations than the Senate. He developed a centrist position, avoiding alignment with either the party's hawks (such as Henry M. Jackson) or its doves (such as McGovern).\nMondale took a liberal position on civil rights, which proved acceptable in Minnesota, a state with \"a minuscule black population\". Mondale was a chief sponsor of the federal Fair Housing Act as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which prohibits discrimination in housing and created the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity as the primary enforcer of the law. During Lyndon B. Johnson's presidency, Mondale supported the Vietnam War. After Nixon became president in 1969, Mondale began to oppose the war and participated in legislation to restrict Nixon's ability to prolong it. Mondale supported abortion rights.\nCommittees.\nMondale rotated on and off numerous committees, including the United States Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences; the United States Senate Committee on Finance; the United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions; the United States Senate Committee on the Budget; and the United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. He also served as chairman of the Select Committee on Equal Education Opportunity and the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's Domestic Task Force. He additionally served as chairman of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee's subcommittee on Children and Youth and the Senate subcommittee on social security financing.\nIn 1975, Mondale served on the Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, chaired by U.S. Senate member Frank Church of Idaho, that investigated alleged abuses by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Documents declassified in 2017 show that the National Security Agency had created a file on Mondale as part of its monitoring of prominent U.S. citizens whose names appeared in signals intelligence.\nApollo 1 accident (1967).\nIn 1967, Mondale served on the Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committee, then chaired by Clinton Anderson, when astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger B. Chaffee were killed in a fire on January 27 while testing the Apollo 204 (later renumbered Apollo 1) spacecraft. NASA Administrator James E. Webb secured President Lyndon Johnson's approval for NASA to internally investigate the cause of the accident according to its established procedures, subject to Congressional oversight. NASA's procedure called for Deputy Administrator (and de facto general manager) Robert Seamans to appoint and oversee an investigative panel.\nIn February, a reporter leaked to Mondale the existence of a Phillips report issued in 1965 by Apollo program director Samuel C. Phillips, detailing management, cost, delivery, and quality problems of the Apollo prime contractor North American Aviation. In the February 27 hearing, Mondale asked Webb if he knew of such a report. Webb had not yet seen the December 1965 written report, so he responded in the negative. Seamans had passed along to Webb neither the written report nor the briefing presentation made to him in January 1966 by Phillips and Phillips's boss, Manned Space Flight Administrator George Mueller. Both Seamans and Mueller had also been called to testify at this session. Mueller denied the report's existence, though he must have been aware of it, as he had appended his own strongly worded letter to the copy sent to North American Aviation president John Leland Atwood.\nSeamans was afraid Mondale might be in possession of a copy (he was not), so he admitted that NASA often reviewed its contractors' performance, with both positive and negative results, but claimed that was nothing extraordinary. Under repeated questioning from Mondale, Webb promised that he would investigate whether the \"Phillips Report\" existed, and if so, whether a controlled release could be made to Congress. Immediately after the hearing, Webb saw the Phillips report for the first time. The controversy spread to both houses of Congress and grew (through the efforts of Mondale's fellow committee member, Republican U.S. Senate member Margaret Chase Smith from Maine to include the second-guessing of NASA's original selection in 1961 of North American as the prime Apollo spacecraft contractor, which Webb became forced to defend). The House NASA oversight committee, which was conducting its own hearings and had picked up on the controversy, was ultimately given a copy of the Phillips report.\nWhile the committee, as a whole, believed that NASA should have informed Congress of the Phillips review results in 1966, its final report issued on January 30, 1968, concluded (as had NASA's own accident investigation completed on April 5, 1967) that \"the findings of the [Phillips] task force had no effect on the accident, did not lead to the accident, and were not related to the accident\". Yet Mondale wrote a minority opinion accusing NASA of \"evasiveness... lack of candor, ... patronizing attitude exhibited toward Congress, ... refusal to respond fully and forthrightly to legitimate congressional inquiries, and ... solicitous concern for corporate sensitivities at a time of national tragedy\". Mondale explained his actions in a 2001 interview: \"I think that by forcing a public confrontation about these heretofore secret and deep concerns about the safety and the management of the program, it forced NASA to restructure and reorganize the program in a way that was much safer.\"\nVice presidency (1977\u20131981).\nWhen Jimmy Carter won the Democratic nomination for President of the United States in 1976, he chose Mondale as his running mate. Mondale campaigned for the ticket in various states. While campaigning in Toledo, Ohio he said that the country needed a strong president to stop inflation and added that President Gerald Ford did not have the guts to stand up to big businesses. The ticket was narrowly elected on November 2, 1976, and Mondale was inaugurated as Vice President of the United States on January 20, 1977. He also became the first vice president to live at Number One Observatory Circle.\nUnder Carter, Mondale traveled extensively throughout the nation and the world advocating the administration's foreign policy. His travels also included a visit to the , which was on station at the time in the Indian Ocean during the Iran hostage crisis. Mondale was the first vice president to have an office in the White House and established the concept of an \"activist Vice President\". He had weekly lunches with the president and expanded the vice president's role from figurehead to presidential advisor, full-time participant, and troubleshooter for the administration. Subsequent vice presidents have followed this model. In 1979, Twin Cities Public Television produced a documentary about his trip to Norway, titled \"Walter Mondale: There's a Fjord in Your Past\", a play on the well-known advertising slogan \"There's a Ford in Your Future\".\nMondale cast one tie-breaking vote in the U.S. Senate on November 4, 1977, allowing the Social Security financing bill to be passed.\n1980 election.\nCarter and Mondale were renominated at the 1980 Democratic National Convention, but soundly lost to the Republican ticket of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. That year, Mondale opened the 1980 Olympic Winter Games in Lake Placid, New York.\nCarter and Mondale were the longest-living post-presidential team in American history. On May 23, 2006, they had been out of office for 9,254 days (25 years, 4 months and 3 days), surpassing the former record established by President John Adams and Vice President Thomas Jefferson, both of whom died on July 4, 1826. On September 8, 2012, Carter surpassed Herbert Hoover as the president with the longest retirement from office. On April 23, 2014, Mondale surpassed Richard Nixon as the vice president with the longest retirement from office at 12,146 days (33 years, 3 months and 3 days). At the time of his death, Mondale was the oldest living U.S. vice president and Carter was the oldest living U.S. president.\nPost-vice presidency (1981\u20132021).\n1984 presidential campaign.\nAfter losing the 1980 election, Mondale returned briefly to the practice of law at Winston &amp; Strawn, a large Chicago-based law firm, but he intended to return to politics before long.\nMondale ran for the Democratic Party presidential nomination in the Democratic presidential primaries preceding the 1984 election, and was soon the front-runner. His opposition included Reverend Jesse Jackson and Senator Gary Hart from Colorado. Hart won the New Hampshire primary in March, but Mondale had much of the party leadership behind him. To great effect, Mondale used the Wendy's slogan \"Where's the beef?\" to describe Hart's policies as lacking depth. Jackson, widely regarded as the first serious African-American candidate for president, held on longer, but Mondale gained the nomination with the majority of delegates.\nAt the Democratic National Convention, Mondale chose United States House of Representatives member Geraldine Ferraro from New York as his running mate, making her the first woman nominated for that position by a major party. Aides later said that Mondale was determined to make a historic choice with his vice presidential candidate, having considered San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein (female and Jewish); Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, an African American; and San Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros, a Mexican American, as finalists. Others preferred U.S. Senate member Lloyd Bentsen of Texas because he would appeal to the Deep South, or even nomination rival Gary Hart. Ferraro, as a Catholic, was criticized by some Catholic Church leaders for being pro-choice. Much more controversy erupted over her changing positions about the release of her husband's tax returns, and her own ethics record in the House. Ferraro was on the defensive throughout much of the campaign, largely negating her breakthrough as the first woman on a major national ticket. She was also the first Italian American to reach that level in American politics.\nWhen Mondale made his acceptance speech at the Democratic Convention, he said: \"By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two\u2011thirds. Let's tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did.\" While this was meant to show that Mondale would be honest with voters, it was instead largely interpreted as a campaign pledge to raise taxes to spend on domestic programs, which was unappealing to many voters.\nMondale ran a liberal campaign, supporting a Nuclear Freeze campaign and the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA). He spoke against Reaganonomics and in support of reducing federal deficit spending. However, the incumbent was popular, and Mondale's campaign was widely considered ineffective. Mondale was also perceived as supporting the poor at the expense of the middle class. In the first televised debate he performed unexpectedly well, which led many to question Reagan's age and capacity to endure the grueling demands of the presidency (Reagan was the oldest person to serve as president\u201473 at the time\u2014while Mondale was 56). In the next debate on October 21, 1984, Reagan deflected the issue by quipping, \"I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.\"\nMondale was defeated in a landslide, receiving 37,577,352 votes (40.6% of the popular vote), and winning only the Washington, D.C. and his home state of Minnesota (even there his margin of victory was fewer than 3,800 votes), securing only 13 electoral votes to Reagan's 525. The result was the worst electoral college defeat for any Democratic Party candidate in history, and the worst for any major-party candidate since Alf Landon's loss to Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936.\nPrivate citizen and ambassador.\nMondale returned to private law practice with Dorsey &amp; Whitney in Minneapolis in 1987. From 1986 to 1993, he chaired the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs.\nHe was appointed by President Bill Clinton as United States Ambassador to Japan from 1993 to 1996 during which he would oversee the U.S. response to the 1995 Okinawa rape incident in which three US servicemen stationed in camp Hansen and Camp Kinser kidnapped, tortured, and raped a 12 year-old girl leading to months of widespread protest and political turmoil throughout the island and between the US and Japanese governments, Returning from a trip, Mondale quickly met with the Japanese Foreign Minister to apologize for the attack and the suffering it caused. This swift apology was seen as necessary to prevent further damage to the U.S.-Japan alliance. s well as his decision to reduce US military operations in Okinawa as a whole, in April 1996, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and Mondale announced the return of the land occupied by the Futenma base. though ultimately the demands of the Okinawan government and many activist would be declined in favor of US strategic goals and Tokyo's own discretion\nHe chaired a bipartisan group to study campaign finance reform, and was Clinton's special envoy to Indonesia in 1998. Until his appointment as Ambassador to Japan, Mondale was a Distinguished University Fellow in Law and Public Affairs at the Humphrey School of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota. In 1990, he established the Mondale Policy Forum at the Humphrey Institute. The forum has brought together leading scholars and policymakers for annual conferences on domestic and international issues.\nMondale spoke before the U.S. Senate on September 4, 2002, delivering a lecture on his service, with commentary on the transformation of the office of the vice president during the Carter administration, the Senate cloture rule for ending debate, and his view of the future of the Senate. The lecture was a part of a continuing Senate \"Leaders Lecture Series\" that ran from 1998 to 2002.\n2002 U.S. Senate election and beyond.\nIn 2002, Democratic Senator Paul Wellstone from Minnesota, who was running for reelection, died in a plane crash 11 days before the November 5 election. Mondale replaced Wellstone on the ballot at the urging of Wellstone's relatives. The Senate seat was the one Mondale had held before resigning to become vice president in 1977.\nDuring his debate with the Republican nominee, former mayor of Saint Paul, Minnesota Norm Coleman, Mondale emphasized his experience, while painting Coleman as right-wing partisan in-line with then-president Bush. Mondale unexpectedly lost the election, receiving 1,067,246 votes (47.34%) to Coleman's 1,116,697 (49.53%). Upon conceding defeat, Mondale said, \"At the end of what will be my last campaign, I want to say to Minnesota, you always treated me well, you always listened to me.\" Mondale's loss in this election made him the first major party candidate to lose an election in every state.\nIn 2004, Mondale became co-chairman of the Constitution Project's bipartisan Right to Counsel Committee. He endorsed U.S. Senate member Hillary Clinton of New York for president in 2008. On June 3, 2008, following the final primary contests, Mondale endorsed U.S. Senate member Barack Obama of Illinois, who had clinched the nomination the previous evening, and won the presidency.\nFollowing the presidential election of 2004 and the midterm elections of 2006, Mondale is seen in the documentary \"\" talking with Al Franken about the possibility of the latter running against Coleman for U.S. Senate in 2008. In the film, Mondale encourages Franken to run, but cautions him, saying that Coleman's allies and the Republican Party would look for anything they could use against him. Franken ultimately ran and won the 2008 Senate election by 312 votes, with Coleman contesting the election results until June 30, 2009. Mondale and U.S. Senate member Amy Klobuchar stood with Franken in the United States Senate chamber when Franken was sworn in on July 7, 2009.\nMondale then stood again with U.S. senator Klobuchar when Tina Smith was sworn in on January 3, 2018. He endorsed Klobuchar's unsuccessful campaign for president in February 2019.\nFamily and personal life.\nMondale's wife, Joan Mondale, was a national advocate for the arts and was the Honorary Chairman of the Federal Council on the Arts and Humanities during the Carter Administration. On February 3, 2014, she died at a hospice in Minneapolis surrounded by family members.\nThe Mondales' eldest son, Ted, is an entrepreneur and the CEO of Nazca Solutions, a technology fulfillment venture. He is also a former Minnesota state senator. In 1998, Ted Mondale unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for Minnesota governor, running as a fiscal moderate who had distanced himself from labor. The Mondales' daughter, Eleanor, was a television personality. She also had radio talk shows in Chicago and a long-running program on WCCO (AM) in Minneapolis. She died of brain cancer at her home in Minnesota on September 17, 2011, at the age of 51. Their younger son, William Hall Mondale, is a former assistant Attorney General of Minnesota.\nMondale had a residence near Lake of the Isles in Minneapolis. He was a Presbyterian. He enjoyed fishing, reading Shakespeare and historical accounts, barbecuing, skiing, watching \"Monty Python\", and playing tennis. Mondale was the recipient of numerous distinctions. He was inducted into Omicron Delta Kappa as an honoris causa initiate at the University of South Carolina in 1981. Mondale also maintained strong ties to the University of Minnesota Law School. In 2002 the school renamed its building Walter F. Mondale Hall. Mondale contributed cameo appearances to the law school's annual T.O.R.T. (\"Theater of the Relatively Talentless\") productions and allowed his name to be used as the nickname of the school's hockey team: the \"Fighting Mondales\".\nMondale had deep connections to his ancestral Norway. Upon entering the Senate in 1964, he took over the seat of vice president Hubert Humphrey, another Norwegian-American. In later years, Mondale served on the executive committee of the Peace Prize Forum, an annual conference co-sponsored by the Norwegian Nobel Institute. On December 5, 2007, Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re announced that Mondale would be named Honorary Consul-General of Norway, representing the Norwegian state in Minnesota. In 2015, Mondale was awarded the Public Leadership in Neurology Award from the American Academy of Neurology for raising awareness for brain health, having lost both his wife and daughter to brain diseases.\nDeath.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDear Team,Well my time has come. I am eager to rejoin Joan and Eleanor. Before I Go I wanted to let you know how much you mean to me. Never has a public servant had a better group of people working at their side!Together we have accomplished so much and I know you will keep up the good fight.Joe in the White House certainly helps.I always knew it would be okay if I arrived some place and was greeted by one of you!My best to all of you!Fritz\n\u2014Mondale's final message to his staff\nMondale died of natural causes in his sleep at his home in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on April 19, 2021, at the age of 93. At the time of his death, Mondale was the oldest living former U.S. vice president. On the day before his death, he had several phone conversations with Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Minnesota governor Tim Walz. Mondale also emailed a final message to his staff, as he and his family had come to the conclusion that \"his death was imminent\".\nCarter said in a statement: \"Today I mourn the passing of my dear friend Walter Mondale, who I consider the best vice president in our country's history ... Rosalynn and I join all Americans in giving thanks for his exemplary life, and we extend our deepest condolences to his family.\" Carter had last seen Mondale in person at the Carter Center in June 2019.\nPresident Biden paid tribute to Mondale in a public statement, calling him a \"dear friend and mentor\" who had \"defined the vice presidency as a full partnership, and helped provide a model for my service\". On April 20, 2021, Biden ordered all flags at government properties, office buildings and public grounds to be flown at half-staff until that Tuesday evening in honor of Mondale.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, funeral services for Mondale were delayed. Two public services were initially planned for September 2021, one in his home state of Minnesota and the other in Washington D.C.; both were later postponed. A memorial service was later held on May 1, 2022, at Northrop Auditorium on the Minneapolis campus of the University of Minnesota. Attendees included family, friends, state and national leaders, including President Joe Biden.\nLegacy.\nIn the \"Walter F.

It was founded in 1874. Its team compete in the Premier League, the top tier of English football, and have played at their home ground, Villa Park, since 1897. Aston Villa is one of the oldest and most successful clubs in England, having won the Football League First Division seven times, the FA Cup seven times, the League Cup five times, and the European Cup and European Super Cup once.\nAston Villa has been a leading English club since the 1880s, when it was a pioneer of the modern passing game. This short, slick combination passing style was introduced by Scotsman George Ramsay, who was appointed as the world's first professional football manager in 1886. The club was influential in the sport's move to professionalism in 1885, and it was a Villa director, William McGregor, who founded the world's first Football League in 1888.\nGeorge Ramsay's trophy haul of six League Championships and six FA Cups established Aston Villa as the most successful club in England, a position it held from the 1890s until the 1970s. Villa scored 128 goals in season 1930\u201331, which remains the all-time top-flight record, however the club began its first decline in the mid-1930s; the 1940s and 1950s were generally a period of mediocrity followed by a steep decline in the 1960s which culminated in a takeover of the club by Doug Ellis in 1968 and Villa's first and only relegation to the third tier of English football in 1969\u201370. Villa returned to the elite from the mid-1970s under manager Ron Saunders, who led the club to a seventh top-flight league title in 1980\u201381. They became only the fourth English club to win the European Cup, in 1981\u201382, followed by the European Super Cup in 1982.\nAston Villa were a founding member of the Premier League in 1992, one of just three clubs to have been a founding member of both the Football League and the Premier League. Throughout the 90s and early 00's, Villa regularly qualified for European football, but following a period of decline after the departure of Martin O'Neill the club suffered its first and only relegation from the Premier League in 2015\u201316. After three seasons in the EFL Championship and two ownership changes the club returned to the Premier League in 2019. Under Unai Emery in 2024, the club qualified for the UEFA Champions League for the first time since 1982\u201383.\nDuring their history Villa has spent 112 seasons in the top-flight, the second highest of any club, and provided 78 England internationals, also the second highest of any club. Aston Villa is currently ranked 5th in the all-time English top flight table, since its creation in 1888 and is the seventh most successful club in English football by competitive honours.\nVilla have a fierce local rivalry with Birmingham City and the Second City derby between the teams has been played since 1879. There is also a local rivalry with West Bromwich Albion, with matches between the sides known as the West Midlands derby. The club's traditional kit colours are claret shirts with sky blue sleeves, white shorts and sky blue socks. Their traditional club badge is of a rampant lion. The club is currently owned by V Sports, a company owned by the Egyptian billionaire Nassef Sawiris, the American billionaire Wes Edens, and American investment company Atairos.\nHistory.\nFormation and rise to prominence (1874\u22121886).\nAston Villa Football Club are believed to have formed on 21 November 1874, by members of the Villa Cross Wesleyan Chapel in Handsworth: which is now part of Birmingham. The four founders of Aston Villa were Jack Hughes, Frederick Matthews, Walter Price and William Scattergood, who were members of the chapel's cricket team looking for a way to stay fit during the winter months. Due to the lack of local football teams Aston Villa's first match was against the local Aston Brook St Mary's Rugby team. As a condition of the match, the Villa side had to agree to play the first half under Rugby rules and the second half under Association rules. Villa won their first game 1\u20130.\nThe infant club's fortunes changed forever when a young Scotsman called George Ramsay stumbled across the Villa players' practice match in Aston Park in 1876. He was asked to make up the numbers, and they were amazed by his skills; they had never seen such a display of close ball control before. When the game was over, the Villa players surrounded him and invited him to join the club and become their captain. Word spread about how fine a player Ramsay was, spectators began turning up to watch the little man nicknamed \u2018Scotty\u2019. He also took charge of training, Ramsay later described the newly formed club's approach to the game as 'a dash at the man and a big kick at the ball'.\nRamsay, on the other hand, had been influenced by the Scottish club Queen's Park, who pioneered what became known as 'combination football' in his native Glasgow. The intricate passing game he introduced was a revolutionary move for an English club in the late 1870s.\nVilla began to establish themselves as one of the best teams in the Midlands, winning their first honour, the Birmingham Senior Cup in 1880. The club went on to lift the trophy nine times in the next 12 seasons.\nVictorian and Edwardian golden age (1886\u20131914).\nFollowing the professionalisation of football in 1885, the club decided that it needed a full-time paid manager. The following advert was placed in the Birmingham Daily Gazette newspaper in June 1886:\nDuring the following season Aston Villa rose to national prominence, as the first Midlands team to win the FA Cup in 1887. Villa's captain, the powerful Scottish centre-forward Archie Hunter, became one of the game's first household names, being the first player to score in every round of the FA Cup. Aston Villa were one of the dozen teams that competed in the inaugural Football League in 1888 with one of the club's directors, William McGregor being the league's founder. Following the professionalisation of football in 1885, clubs needed regular income to pay their players' wages. Frequently friendlies were cancelled due to opponents' FA Cup or county cup matches or clubs simply failed to honour a fixture in favour of a more lucrative match elsewhere. McGregor took action after seeing Villa matches cancelled, to the increasing frustration of the club's fans, on five consecutive Saturdays. In March 1888, he wrote to the committee of his own club, Aston Villa, as well as to those of Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers, Preston North End and West Bromwich Albion, suggesting the creation of a league competition that would provide a number of guaranteed fixtures for its member clubs each season. Following two meetings between representatives of the leading clubs, the world's first Football League season began in September 1888 with 12 member clubs from the Midlands and north of England: Accrington, Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers, Burnley, Derby County, Everton, Notts County, Preston North End, Stoke, West Bromwich Albion and Wolverhampton Wanderers.\nDespite Villa founding the league, by 1893 they had yet to win it. Villa Committee Member Frederick Rinder was the instigator of a club meeting at Barwick Street in February 1893 that removed the committee running the club at the time. All fourteen committee members resigned and were replaced by a committee of five led by Rinder after he gave a rousing speech criticising the board's tolerance of ill discipline and players' drinking. On the pitch, manager George Ramsay was moulding a team that became renowned for its short, quick combination passing which saw Villa win its first league title in 1893\u201394; the season after that the club won its second FA Cup in 1894-95. This was followed by back-to-back League titles in 1895\u201396 and 1896\u201397.\nAston Villa emerged as the most successful English club of the Victorian era, winning no fewer than five League titles and three FA Cups by the end of Queen Victoria's reign in 1901. Villa's captain during this era was Birmingham-born forward John Devey, who enjoyed a successful partnership with the lightning-fast winger Charlie Athersmith and marshalling Villa's defence was the tough-tackling Scotsman James Cowan, who had an unrivalled sense of timing and anticipation. In 1897, the year Villa won The Double, they moved into their present home, the Aston Lower Grounds. Supporters coined the name \"Villa Park\"; no official declaration listed the ground as Villa Park.\nSuccess continued into the Edwardian era, with Villa lifting the FA Cup for the fourth time in 1904\u201305, and a sixth league title in 1909\u201310. A further FA Cup triumph was achieved on the eve of the First World War in 1913, with the club narrowly missing out on winning a second Double, finishing runners-up in the league. Star players during this era included Howard Spencer, the cultured defender who captained both Villa and England, and the prolific strike force of Joe Bache and Harry Hampton who between them scored 382 goals in claret and blue.\nRelative decline and first relegation (1920\u20131939).\nIn January 1920, Billy Walker scored twice on his Villa debut in a 2\u20131 FA Cup first-round win over QPR; the club won the FA Cup for the sixth time that season and Walker went on to establish himself as Villa's star player of the 1920s, scoring a record 244 goals in 531 appearances, captaining Villa and England. George Ramsay retired in 1926, at the age of 71, and his replacement Billy Smith was unable to continue Ramsay's success. In reality, several other football clubs had caught up with Aston Villa, most notably Arsenal, to which the club finished runners-up in the league in 1930\u201331 and 1932\u201333. Despite missing out on the league title, Villa Park crowds were entertained by attacking football; the 128 goals scored in the 1930\u201331 season remains the all-time top-flight record. A remarkable 49 of the league goals that season were scored by centre-forward Tom 'Pongo' Waring, with another 30 goals from winger Eric Houghton.\nThe club appointed Jimmy McMullan as manager in 1934, however, the move proved disastrous, resulting in Villa's first ever relegation in 1935\u201336 after 48 years in the top flight. Villa struggled largely due to a dismal defensive record: they conceded 110 goals in 42 games, 7 of them coming from Arsenal's Ted Drake in an infamous 1\u20137 defeat at Villa Park. The club made seven signings and spent a staggering sum for the time of \u00a335,500 trying to retain top-flight status at all costs, but were unable to buy their way out of trouble. Aston Villa, at the time one of the most famous and successful clubs in world football, was relegated in 1936 for the first time in its history.\nFollowing relegation to the Second Division, the Villa board brought back the ageing former club chairman Fred Rinder, who said on his return \"Villa have been a great club, are still a great club, and always will be a great club\". He was vocal in his criticism of the board for its \"almost total neglect of the reserve team, instead relying on paying big fees for ready made players\". He believed that this change in policy from scouting and developing young homegrown talent led to a decline in the club's culture and style of play, which alongside a tolerance of ill-discipline in the players led to Villa's relegation. Rinder's first act was to travel to Austria to recruit the progressive coach Jimmy Hogan as manager. Within two seasons, Hogan had guided Villa back to the top flight as Second Division champions playing attractive free-flowing football. Hogan outlined his philosophy: \"I am a teacher and lover of constructive football with every pass, every kick, every movement an object.\" He used to tell his players that \"football was like a Viennese waltz, a rhapsody. One-two-three, one-two-three, pass-move-pass, pass-move-pass.\" However, the Second World War ended Hogan's project to restore Aston Villa to the top of the English game.\nMediocrity and discontent (1945\u20131961).\nLike all English clubs, Villa lost seven seasons to the Second World War, and that conflict brought several careers to a premature end. Bumper crowds flocked to Villa Park following the war, 76,588 people attended the FA Cup quarter-final between Villa and Derby County in March 1946, which is the all-time record attendance at Villa Park. The team was rebuilt under the guidance of former player Alex Massie for the remainder of the 1940s. Star players of this era included the one-club man Harry Parkes, the Welsh centre forward Trevor Ford and inside-forward Johnny Dixon, however the club only achieved mid-table finishes throughout the forties and fifties, never finishing higher than 6th place in the league. The board came in for increasing criticism during this time, with the 1953 AGM described by the Sports Argus as \"the longest and liveliest Villa meeting\". Shareholders and supporters criticised the club's lack of youth development, recruitment and training methods. When Danny Blanchflower submitted a transfer request in 1954 he said that \"the club had grown fat and lazy on its old traditions and the decay was eating at the once solid foundations\".\nDespite narrowly avoiding relegation the season before, Aston Villa's first trophy for 37 years came in the 1956\u201357 season when another former Villa player, Eric Houghton led the club to a then record seventh FA Cup Final win, defeating the 'Busby Babes' of Manchester United 2\u20131 with Northern Irish winger Peter McParland scoring both goals. The team continued to struggle for consistency in the league though, which led to Eric Houghton being sacked in December 1958. His replacement Joe Mercer could not prevent the club being relegated for only the second time in their history in 1958-59. However, under the stewardship of Mercer, Villa returned to the top-flight in 1960 as Second Division Champions with a talented young side which became known as 'Mercer's Minors'. In the following season Aston Villa became the first team to win the Football League Cup, with England centre-forward Gerry Hitchens scoring an impressive 42 goals in 1960-61.\nDeep malaise and revival (1961\u20131974).\nHitchens' goals brought him to the attention of Italian club Inter Milan, who offered him a large financial incentive to sign. He was sold for \u00a385,000 in summer of 1961, his replacement, Derek Dougan was not a success and Villa slid backwards. Mercer's forced retirement from the club in July 1964, following a stress-induced stroke, signalled a period of deep turmoil and malaise. The most successful club in England had failed to keep pace with changes in the modern game; three of the five-man board of directors were over 70 years old, the club had neglected its scouting network and coaching structure and the club's finances were in a parlous state. This led to the club selling its top striker Tony Hateley to Chelsea for \u00a3100,000 in October 1966, without his goals Villa were relegated for the third time in its history, under manager Dick Taylor in 1967. The board even sold the club's training ground outside Villa Park for housing, leaving the team in the position of training on borrowed training pitches of local factory teams.\nThe following season the fans called for the board to resign as Villa finished 16th in the Second Division. With mounting debts and Villa lying at the bottom of Division Two, the board sacked Tommy Cummings (the manager brought in to replace Taylor), and within weeks the entire board resigned under overwhelming pressure from fans. After much speculation, control of the club was bought by London financier Pat Matthews, who brought in Doug Ellis as chairman in December 1968. Ellis later recalled that \"you could write your name in the dust, window frames were rotting, the smell of failure and imminent financial ruin hung in the air\"; one of their first acts was to raise \u00a3205,835 in a share issue which cleared the club's debts. Doug Ellis's first managerial appointment was the outspoken Scottish manager Tommy Docherty, who after initial success, was sacked after 13 months in charge with the club at the foot of Second Division. His replacement was former club captain and reserve team manager Vic Crowe, who could not prevent Villa being relegated to the Third Division for the first time in its history at the end of the 1969\u201370 season.\nThe following season Villa surprised everyone by beating Manchester United in the two-legged semi-final to reach the 1971 League Cup Final, in which the team played well but were defeated by two late Tottenham Hotspur goals. There was a renewed sense of optimism at Villa Park as the club was promoted to the Second Division as champions with average attendances of 30,000 and a record 70 points in 1971\u201372 season. Off the pitch, the board purchased the new 20-acre Bodymoor Heath Training Ground in December 1971, with a view to improving the club's youth development and coaching facilities.\nBack among the elite (1974\u20131992).\nFollowing a 14th-place finish in the Second Division, Crowe was replaced in August 1974 by Ron Saunders. He was a fitness fanatic, whose brand of no-nonsense man-management proved effective, with the club winning the League Cup the following season and, by the end of season 1974\u201375, he had taken Aston Villa back into the First Division and into Europe. One player who had been a mainstay of the Villa team throughout the rollercoaster of relegations and subsequent revival was fan-favourite Charlie Aitkin, who made 659 appearances at left back for the club between 1959 and 1976, making him Villa's all-time record appearance holder.\nAston Villa were back among the elite as Saunders continued to mould a winning team, finishing 4th in the league and winning a further League Cup in 1976\u201377, with the formidable strike partnership of Brian Little and Andy Gray, who became the first player to win both the PFA Young Player of the Year and PFA Players' Player of the Year in the same season.\nThe 1970s was an era of boardroom unrest at Villa Park. Ron Saunders had a strained relationship with Doug Ellis, resenting Doug's perceived interference in football matters. Over time Ellis became an isolated figure on the board, as the other directors sided with Saunders. He was ousted as chairman in 1975 to make way for Sir William Dugdale. He remained on the board until 1979, when he left the club after a protracted power struggle with majority shareholder Ron Bendall. With Ellis gone, Saunders became all-powerful as manager.\nVilla achieved a seventh top-flight league title in 1980\u201381, with players such as Gordon Cowans, Tony Morley and captain Dennis Mortimer leading the club to its first top-flight title in 71 years. Remarkably, they did so using just 14 players, with seven players being ever-presents. Villa's Birmingham-born forward Gary Shaw was named 1980-1981 PFA Young Player of the Year.\nTo the surprise of commentators and fans, Ron Saunders quit halfway through the 1981\u201382 season, with Villa in the quarter final of the European Cup. Saunders had expressed his exasperation with the board at the lack of funds available to him to strengthen the team and fell out with the chairman Ron Bendall over the terms of his contract. He was replaced by his softly-spoken assistant manager Tony Barton who guided the club to a 1\u20130 victory over Bayern Munich in the European Cup final in Rotterdam courtesy of a Peter Withe goal in the 67th minute. Ten minutes into the final, Villa's first choice goalkeeper, Jimmy Rimmer, was injured and young substitute keeper Nigel Spink was called into action, having only made one previous appearance in the first team. Spink performed superbly, keeping a clean sheet, and helping Villa become only the fourth English club to lift the European Cup. \nThe following season the defence of the European Cup ended in a quarter-final defeat to Juventus, but Villa won the European Super Cup, beating Barcelona 3\u20131 on aggregate. This marked a pinnacle though and Villa's fortunes declined sharply for most of the 1980s. Doug Ellis returned as chairman and majority shareholder in November 1982. The club was saddled with significant debts and questions had been raised by the police regarding fraudulent financial activity surrounding the building of the North Stand at Villa Park from 1980 to 1982. The cost of the work was \u00a31.3\u00a0million. An internal investigation found that \u00a3700,000 of the \u00a31.3\u00a0million worth of bills were unaccounted for. A later report by accountants Deloitte found that there were \"serious breaches of recommended codes of practice and poor site supervision\". Ellis immediately set about trying to reduce the club's overheads. He informed the players that they needed to take pay cuts and told the manager Tony Barton that there was a need to reduce the playing staff. Saunders' team was broken up and not adequately replaced, culminating in the club being relegated in 1987, just five years after Villa had been crowned European champions.\nHowever, Villa bounced back quickly, achieving promotion the following year under Graham Taylor and a runners-up position in the top-flight in the 1989\u201390 season with a fine side that included Paul McGrath, Tony Daley and David Platt. Following this success, Graham Taylor accepted the offer to take over as England manager in 1990.\n24 years in the Premier League (1992\u20132016).\nVilla were one of the founding members of the Premier League in 1992, one of just three clubs to have been founding members of both the Football League in 1888 and the Premier League, along with Blackburn Rovers and Everton. Villa finished runners-up to Manchester United in the inaugural season under manager Ron Atkinson. His side lifted the League Cup in 1994, beating Manchester United 3\u20131 in the final, with goals from Dalian Atkinson and Dean Saunders, but the team struggled for form in the league and Atkinson was replaced by former Villa striker Brian Little in November 1994. Little assembled a young side which included players as Gareth Southgate, Steve Staunton, Ian Taylor and Dwight Yorke, leading the club to a fifth League Cup triumph in 1996, beating Leeds United 3\u20130 at Wembley. Villa finished fourth in the league that season, and fifth the season after.\nFollowing a dip in form, Doug Ellis sacked Little and replaced him with another former Villa player John Gregory in February 1998. One of his first matches in charge was the UEFA Cup quarter-final against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, which Villa lost on away goals over two-legs. In the summer of 1998, Yorke was transferred to Manchester United for \u00a312.6 million. Gregory managed four top-eight finishes in the league and took the club to an FA Cup final in 2000 with a side that included David James, Dion Dublin, Paul Merson and Gareth Barry but was unable to assemble a team capable of challenging for Champions League places. At the end of the season Villa's captain Gareth Southgate handed in a transfer request, claiming that \"if I am to achieve in my career, it is time to move on\". Gregory's frustration at the lack of investment in the team led to him publicly accusing Ellis of being \"stuck a time warp\"; their relationship remained strained until Gregory resigned in January 2002.\nEllis appointed Graham Taylor for a second spell in February 2002, but a 16th-place finish in the league led to his replacement with David O'Leary in June 2003. After a sixth-place finish in his first season, Villa the finished 10th and 16th, leading to O'Leary leaving in the summer of 2006. \nAfter 23 years as chairman and single biggest shareholder (approximately 38%), Ellis sold his stake in Aston Villa due to ill-health at the age of 82. American businessman Randy Lerner, owner of NFL franchise the Cleveland Browns, completed his takeover in September 2006. The arrival of a new owner in Lerner and of manager Martin O'Neill marked the start of a new period of optimism at Villa Park and sweeping changes occurred throughout the club including a new badge, investment in state-of-the-art facilities at the Bodymoor Heath Training Ground and significant investment in the squad in the summer of 2007. The first Cup final of the Lerner era came in 2010 when Villa were beaten 2\u20131 in the League Cup Final.\nJust five days before the opening day of the 2010\u201311 season, O'Neill resigned as manager, despite three consecutive 6th-place finishes, due to frustration in the lack of investment in the squad, following the sale of star players Gareth Barry, James Milner and Ashley Young. His replacement G\u00e9rard Houllier stepped down due to ill-health in September 2011, to be replaced by Birmingham City manager Alex McLeish, despite fan protests against his appointment. McLeish's contract was terminated at the end of the 2011\u201312 season after Villa finished in 16th place, and he was replaced by Paul Lambert.\nIn February 2012, the club announced a financial loss of \u00a353.9\u00a0million, and Lerner put the club up for sale three months later. With Lerner still on board, but unwilling to spend following the stock market crash of 2008, the club was uncompetitive for several seasons, culminating in the 2014\u201315 season, when Lambert was sacked in February 2015 after the team managed just 12 goals in the first 25 league games, the lowest in Premier League history. Tim Sherwood succeeded him, and steered the club away from relegation while also leading them to the 2015 FA Cup Final. However, the club sold two of its star players Christian Benteke and captain Fabian Delph in the summer transfer window and did not adequately replace them. Villa struggled in the 2015\u201316 season, and Sherwood was sacked following six consecutive defeats. He was replaced by R\u00e9mi Garde, who left after just five months with Villa lying bottom of the table; his reign included a club-record 19 game winless run. The club was relegated at the end of the season, ending their 29-year stay in the top flight.\nChampionship to Champions League (2016\u2013present).\nIn June 2016, Chinese businessman Tony Xia bought the club for \u00a376 million. Former Chelsea boss Roberto Di Matteo was appointed as the club's new manager, but was dismissed after just 12 games following a poor start to the season. He was replaced by former Birmingham manager Steve Bruce. Bruce led the team to finish fourth in the 2017\u201318 season, but lost in the 2018 EFL Championship play-off final to Fulham.\nFollowing failure to secure promotion to the Premier League, the club faced significant financial difficulties. Following rumours that administration was imminent, Xia looked to sell the club. On 20 July 2018 it was announced that the NSWE Group, a consortium consisting of Egyptian billionaire Nassef Sawiris and the American billionaire Wes Edens, were to invest in the football club. They purchased a controlling 55% stake in the club, and Sawiris took over the role of club chairman, appointing Christian Purslow as CEO.\nIn October 2018, Bruce was dismissed after winning only once in a nine match stretch. He was replaced by Brentford manager and boyhood Villa fan Dean Smith, who led the team to fifth place, and reaching the playoffs again\u2014helped on by a club-record 10 league game winning streak. They reached the 2019 EFL Championship play-off final and defeated Derby County 2\u20131 to gain promotion back to the Premier League after a three-year absence.\nOn the eve of Villa's Premier League return, Recon Group's minority share ownership was bought out by NSWE, meaning Xia no longer had any stake in the club. Villa's first season back in the Premier League saw a significant overhaul of the squad, with 12 players signed during the summer transfer window. The team battled relegation for most of the season, but stayed up on the final day with a 17th-place finish. In Villa's second season back in the Premier League, Smith oversaw an 11th-place finish, but was unable to persuade star player and captain Jack Grealish to remain at the club after Manchester City's British-record \u00a3100 million bid triggered his release clause. Following a poor start to the 2021\u201322 season, which saw seven losses in the club's opening 11 games, Dean Smith was dismissed.\nAston Villa appointed former Liverpool and England captain Steven Gerrard as head coach on 11 November 2021. After a poor start to the 2022\u201323 season, in which Villa won just twice and scored only seven goals in their opening 11 games, Gerrard was sacked in October 2022, and replaced by four-time Europa League-winning Spanish manager Unai Emery. He led Villa to 7th place and qualification for the Europa Conference League in his first season. In the 2023\u201324 season, Emery led the club to the Conference League semi-finals, where they were knocked out by Olympiacos, and a fourth-place finish in the league, securing participation in the UEFA Champions League for the first time since 1982\u201383. In the following Champions League campaign, the team reached the quarter-finals before a 5\u20134 aggregate loss to eventual winners Paris Saint-Germain.\nColours and badge.\n \n Villa's proposed kit of 1886\nThe club colours are a claret shirt with sky blue sleeves, white shorts with claret and blue trim, and sky blue socks with claret and white trim. They were the original wearers of the claret and blue. Villa's colours at the outset were royal blue caps and stockings, royal blue and scarlet \"striped\" (in the context of the time, hooped) jerseys, and white knickerbockers, one of the club rules including a provision that \"no member can take part in a match without wearing the above uniform\". For a few years after that (1877\u201379) the team wore several different kits from all white, blue and black, red and blue to plain green. By 1880, black jerseys with a Scottish Lion Rampant embroidered on the chest were introduced by Villa's Scottish leaders William McGregor and George Ramsay. This remained the first choice strip for six years. On Monday, 8 November 1886, an entry in the club's official minute book states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;(i) Proposed and seconded that the colours be chocolate and sky blue shirts and that we order two dozen.\n(ii) Proposed and seconded that Mr McGregor be requested to supply them at the lowest quotation.\nThe chocolate colour later became claret. Nobody is quite sure why claret and blue became the club's adopted colours. Several other football teams adopted their colours, or also play in claret and blue, including West Ham United, Burnley, Scunthorpe United and Turkish club Trabzonspor. Crystal Palace also played in Villa's colours until the 1970s.\nA new badge was revealed in May 2007, for the 2007\u201308 season and beyond. The new badge includes a star to represent the European Cup win in 1982, and has a light blue background behind Villa's 'lion rampant'. The traditional motto \"Prepared\" remains in the badge, and the name Aston Villa has been shortened to AVFC, FC having been omitted from the previous badge. The lion is now unified as opposed to fragmented lions of the past. Randy Lerner petitioned fans to help with the design of the new badge.\nOn 6 April 2016, the club confirmed that it would be using a new badge from the 2016\u201317 season after consulting fan groups for suggestions. The lion in the new badge has claws added to it, and the word \"Prepared\" was removed to increase the size of the lion and club initials in the badge. In November 2022, following a fan-led vote, the club announced it would adopt a new badge for the following season. The new badge's usage was later clarified to be exclusive to on-field kits and training wear by club president of business operations, Chris Heck, with the existing badge continuing to be utilized as the primary in all other channels. In May 2024, the club reverted to a shield-shaped badge.\nKit manufacturers and sponsors.\nTables of kit suppliers and shirt sponsors appear below:\nAston Villa's kit was produced by local manufacturers until 1974, when Umbro became the first kit supplier to have its logo on a Villa shirt. Aston Villa's first shirt sponsor was Davenports Breweries in the 1982\u201383 season. Aston Villa forwent commercial kit sponsorship for the 2008\u201309 and 2009\u201310 seasons; instead advertising the charity Acorns Children's Hospice, the first deal of its kind in Premier League history. The partnership continued until 2010 when a commercial sponsor replaced Acorns, with the hospice becoming the club's Official Charity Partner. A shirt sleeve sponsor was used for the first time in the 2019\u201320 season with BR88 being displayed. In August 2025, Aston Villa announced a partnership with Red Bull, making the company the club's Official Energy Drink Partner.\nStadium.\nAston Villa's current home venue is Villa Park; the team previously played at Aston Park (1874\u20131876) and Wellington Road (1876\u20131897). Villa Park is the largest football stadium in the English Midlands, and the eighth largest stadium in England. It has hosted 16 England internationals at senior level, the first in 1899, and the most recent in 2005. Thus, it was the first English ground to stage international football in three different centuries. Villa Park is the most used stadium in FA Cup semi-final history, having hosted 55 semi-finals. In 2022, the club announced plans to rebuild the North Stand and part of the Trinity Road stand, which will take the maximum capacity over 50,000.\nThe current training ground is located at Bodymoor Heath near Kingsbury in north Warwickshire, the site for which was purchased by former chairman Doug Ellis in the early 1970s from a local farmer. Although Bodymoor Heath was state-of-the-art in the 1970s, by the late 1990s the facilities had started to look dated. In November 2005, Ellis and Aston Villa plc announced a state of the art \u00a313\u00a0million redevelopment of Bodymoor in two phases. The new training ground was officially unveiled on 6 May 2007, by then manager Martin O'Neill, then-team captain Gareth Barry and 1982 European Cup winning team captain Dennis Mortimer, with the Aston Villa squad moving in for the 2007\u201308 season.\nIt was announced on 6 August 2014, that Villa Park would appear in the FIFA video game from \"FIFA 15\", with all other Premier League stadiums also fully licensed from this game onwards.\nAston Villa operates under the guidance of the Safety Advisory Group (SAG), which is responsible for issuing safety certificates for matches held at Villa Park, taking into account both physical and security considerations. In 2023, ahead of a UEFA Europa Conference League match against Legia Warsaw, away supporters were barred from attending following clashes outside the stadium. Similarly, in November 2025, fans of Maccabi Tel Aviv F.C. were prohibited from attending a scheduled UEFA Europa League match at Villa Park mainly due to the threat of violence by Maccabi fans.\nOwnership.\nThe first shares in the club were issued towards the end of the 19th century as a result of legislation that was intended to codify the growing numbers of professional teams and players in the Association Football leagues. FA teams were required to distribute shares to investors as a way of facilitating trading among the teams without implicating the FA itself. This trading continued for much of the 20th century until Ellis started buying up many of the shares in the 1960s. He was chairman and substantial shareholder of \"Aston Villa F.C.\" from 1968 to 1975 and the majority shareholder from 1982 to 2006. The club were floated on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in 1996, and the share price fluctuated in the ten years after the flotation. In 2006, it was announced that several consortia and individuals were considering bids for Aston Villa.\nOn 14 August 2006, it was confirmed that Randy Lerner, then owner of the National Football League's Cleveland Browns, had reached an agreement of \u00a362.6\u00a0million with Aston Villa for a takeover of the club. Lerner took full control on 18 September with Ellis and his board replaced with a new board by Lerner on 19 September 2006. Lerner appointed himself chairman of the club with Charles Krulak as a non-executive director and Ellis awarded the honorary position of Chairman Emeritus. Lerner put the club up for sale in May 2014, valuing it at an estimated \u00a3200\u00a0million.\nOn 18 May 2016, Randy Lerner agreed the sale of Aston Villa to Recon Group, owned by Chinese businessman Tony Xia. The sale was completed on 14 June 2016 for a reported \u00a376 million, after being approved by the Football League. After a period of high expenditure and failing to secure promotion to the Premier League in the 2017\u201318 Championship playoff final, financial difficulties at the club began to mount. Amid rumours that Villa risked entering administration, Xia entered talks to sell the club in June 2018.\nOn 20 July 2018, it was announced that V Sports (at the time known as NSWE Group), a consortium consisting of Egyptian billionaire Nassef Sawiris and the American billionaire Wes Edens, were to invest in the football club. They purchased a controlling 55% stake in the club, and Sawiris took over the role of club chairman. On 9 August 2019, following Villa's promotion to the Premier League, Companies House revealed that the remainder of Xia's shares had been bought out, and that Xia no longer had any stake in the club.\nOn 15 December 2023, Aston Villa announced that Comcast-backed American investment firm Atairos would invest in V Sports, the ultimate parent company of the club. The agreement, which saw Atairos obtain a stake of approximately 20% in V Sports, valued Villa at more than \u00a3500 million. The deal with Atairos was finalised on 12 April 2024, with Atairos CEO and former Comcast CFO Michael Angelakis appointed to Villa's board of directors.\nSocial responsibility.\nAston Villa has a unique relationship with the Acorns Children's Hospice charity that is groundbreaking in English football. In a first for the Premier League, Aston Villa donated the front of its kit shirts, usually reserved for high-paying sponsorships, to Acorns Hospice so that the charity would gain significant additional visibility and more funds. Outside of the shirt sponsorship the club has paid for hospice care for the charity as well as regularly providing player visits to hospice locations.\nIn September 2010, Aston Villa launched an initiative at Villa Park called Villa Midlands Food (VMF) where the club will spend two years training students with Aston Villa hospitality and events in association with Birmingham City Council. The club opened a restaurant in the Trinity Road Stand staffed with 12 students recruited from within a 10-mile (16\u00a0km) radius of Villa Park with most of the food served in the restaurant sourced locally.\nAston Villa Foundation.\nIn 2016, Aston Villa created a registered charity, the Aston Villa Foundation. The aim of the charity is to deliver the social responsibility work of Aston Villa. Working alongside key local and national stakeholders, the Foundation delivers projects such as football in the community, disability, health and wellbeing, education, interventions and community relations.\nIn May 2021, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, met with members of the Foundation at Aston Villa's Bodymoor Heath Training Ground. This was following the Foundation providing 1000 hot meals a week to local organisations during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, as well as allowing a local NHS Trust to make use of Villa Park's facilities.\nSupporters and rivalries.\nAston Villa have a large fanbase and draw support from all over the Midlands and beyond, with supporters' clubs all across the world. Former Villa chief executive Richard Fitzgerald has stated that the ethnicity of the supporters is currently 98% white. When Randy Lerner's regime took over at Villa Park, they aimed to improve the support from ethnic minorities. A number of organisations have been set up to support the local community, including Aston Pride. A Villa in the Community programme has also been set up to encourage support among young people in the region. The new owners have also initiated several surveys aimed at gaining the opinions of Villa fans and to involve them in the decision-making process. Meetings also occur every three months where supporters are invited by ballot and are invited to ask questions to the board. In 2011, the club supported a supporter-based initiative for an official anthem to boost the atmosphere at Villa Park. The song \"The Bells Are Ringing\" is to be played before games.\nLike many English football clubs, Aston Villa has had several hooligan firms associated with it: Villa Youth, Steamers, Villa Hardcore and the C-Crew, the last mentioned being very active during the 1970s and 1980s. In 2004, several Villa firms were involved in a fight with QPR fans outside Villa Park in which a steward died. As can be seen across the whole of English football, due to incidents like the aforementioned, the hooligan groups have now been marginalised. The main groupings of supporters can now be found in a number of domestic and international supporters' clubs. This includes the Official Aston Villa Supporters Club which also has many smaller regional and international sections. There were several independent supporters clubs during the reign of Doug Ellis but most of these disbanded after his retirement. The supporter group My Old Man Said formed to stand up for Villa supporters' rights, as a direct result of Villa supporters' protest against the club's appointment of Alex McLeish. The club's supporters also publish fanzines such as \"Heroes and Villains\" and \"The Holy Trinity\".\nAston Villa's arch-rivals are Birmingham City, with games between the two clubs known as the Second City Derby. Historically though, West Bromwich Albion have arguably been Villa's greatest rivals, a view highlighted in a fan survey, conducted in 2003. The two teams contested three FA Cup finals in the late 19th century. Villa also enjoy less heated local rivalries with Wolverhampton Wanderers and Coventry City. Through the relegation of West Brom and Birmingham City, to the Football League Championship, in the 2005\u201306 season, at the start of 2006\u201307 Premiership season, Villa were the only Midlands club in that League. The nearest opposing team Villa faced during that season was Sheffield United, who played away in South Yorkshire. For the 2010\u201311 season, West Bromwich Albion were promoted and joined Aston Villa, Wolverhampton Wanderers, and Birmingham City in the Premier League. This marked the first time that the \"West Midlands' Big Four\" clubs were in the Premier League at the same time, and the first time together in the top flight since the 1983\u201384 season. Birmingham were relegated at the end of the 2010\u201311 season, ending this period.\nThe rivalry with Birmingham City was renewed in 2016\u201317 when Aston Villa suffered relegation from the Premier League. They were joined by West Brom two years later, but Villa won promotion back to the Premier League in 2019.\nIn 2024, a supporter group named 1897 Group \u2013 named after the year that the club first used Villa Park as their home stadium \u2013 formed with the stated intention of vocally and visually enhancing the atmosphere for the club's matches at Villa Park. Following a subsequent meeting with club officials, 1897 Group were allocated a section of seats in the stadium's Doug Ellis Stand for a Premier League match against A.F.C. Bournemouth. This launched the group's physical presence at matches. \n1897 Group also help to organise and carry out flag and tifo displays in Villa Park's Holte End stand and also in other sections of the stadium for some Villa home matches. Additionally, they have also organised and promoted Villa fan marches where Villa supporters are encouraged by the group to congregate at a designated point in the town or city that Villa are playing in and walk all together to the stadium.\nRecords and statistics.\nThe 2024\u201325 campaign is Aston Villa's 111th season in the top tier of English football. The only club to have spent longer in the top flight are Everton, with 122 seasons, making Aston Villa versus Everton the most-played fixture in English top-flight football. Aston Villa was relegated from the top tier of English football in 2016, having played in every Premier League season since its establishment in 1992\u201393, but was promoted back in 2018\u201319. They are ninth in the All-time Premier League table, and have the fifth-highest total of major honours (20) won by an English club.\nAston Villa currently holds the record number of league goals scored by any team in the English top flight; 128 goals were scored in the 1930\u201331 season, one more than Arsenal who won the league that season for the first time, with Villa runners-up. Villa forward Archie Hunter became the first player to score in every round of the FA Cup in Villa's victorious 1887 campaign. Villa's longest unbeaten home run in the FA Cup spanned 13 years and 19 games, from 1888 to 1901.\nAston Villa are one of six English teams to have won the European Cup. They did so on 26 May 1982 in Rotterdam, beating Bayern Munich 1\u20130 thanks to Peter Withe's goal. As of 2024[ [update]], Aston Villa are only surpassed by Tottenham Hotspur (79), for providing the most England internationals with 77 Villa players debuting for England since 1882.\nHonours.\nAston Villa have won both European and domestic league honours. The club's last English honour was in 1996 when they won the League Cup, and most recently they won the 2001 UEFA Intertoto Cup.\nDomestic.\nLeague\nCups\n \"As of 2 September 2025\"\nPlayers.\nFirst-team squad.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Football squad player/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOut on loan.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Football squad player/styles.css\" /&gt;\n \"As of 27 August 2025\", \"players under 21 who are listed in the official senior squad or have made their senior league debut are listed in the senior squad above, this list below includes all academy players to have been named in a competitive senior matchday squad\".\nUnder-21s and Academy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Football squad player/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOut on loan.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Football squad player/styles.css\" /&gt;\nClub captains.\nSince the foundation of the club in 1874, forty four players have been club captain of Aston Villa. John Devey who was captain from 1891 to 1898, is their most successful captain, leading Villa to five league titles and two FA Cup triumphs during the club's 'Golden Age'. The present captain is Scotland international John McGinn.\nNotable players.\nThere have been many players who can be called notable throughout Aston Villa's history. These can be classified and recorded in several forms. The Halls of Fame and PFA Players of the Year are noted below. Aston Villa have had several players who were one-club men, including inaugural club Hall of Fame inductee Billy Walker. In 1998, to celebrate the 100th season of League football, The Football League released a list entitled the Football League 100 Legends that consisted of \"100 legendary football players\". There were seven players included on the list who played for Villa: Danny Blanchflower, Trevor Ford, Archie Hunter, Sam Hardy, Paul McGrath, Clem Stephenson and Peter Schmeichel (who went on to play for Villa three seasons later). Schmeichel was later inducted into the Premier League Hall of Fame in 2022, with former Villa captain and coach John Terry inducted in 2024.\nAston Villa have had a number of players who have been successful on the international stage while they were at the club. Paul McGrath and Steve Staunton (Republic of Ireland), as well as Olof Mellberg (Sweden) all captained their national sides in the 1990, 2002 and 2006 World Cups respectively. McGrath appeared nine times at the World Cup while at Aston Villa, a record for an active Villa player. Emiliano Mart\u00ednez has won all his senior Argentina caps to date while at Aston Villa, having debuted in June 2021. He is currently the most decorated international player for Aston Villa having won the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica, the 2022 Finalissima, the 2022 FIFA World Cup, and the 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica; he was awarded the \"Golden Glove\" awards at the 2021 and 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica and the 2022 World Cup; he was twice named both the Best FIFA Goalkeeper and the Yashin Trophy winner between 2022 and 2024.\nThree Aston Villa players have won the PFA Players' Player of the Year award. In 1977 Andy Gray won the award. In 1990 it was awarded to David Platt, whilst Paul McGrath won it in 1993. The PFA Young Player of the Year, which is awarded to players under the age of 23, has been awarded to five players from Aston Villa: Andy Gray in 1977; Gary Shaw in 1981; Ashley Young in 2009, James Milner in 2010 and Morgan Rogers in 2025.\nThe National Football Museum administers the English Football Hall of Fame which currently contains one Villa team, five Villa players and one manager. The 1982 European Cup-winning team were inducted into the Hall of Fame in October 2011. Former Aston Villa players named in the Hall of Fame are Clem Stephenson, Danny Blanchflower, Peter Schmeichel, Cyrille Regis, and Paul McGrath; as well as former manager Joe Mercer.\nIn 2006, the club announced the creation of an Aston Villa Hall of Fame. This was voted for by fans and the inaugural induction saw 12 former players, managers and directors named. Former club captain Stiliyan Petrov was added to the list in May 2013. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSource:\nNon-playing staff.\nNotable managers.\nThe following managers have all won at least one trophy when in charge or have been notable for Villa in the context of the League, for example Jozef Venglo\u0161 who holds a League record.\nIn popular culture.\nAn Aston Villa team were the subject, together with that of Sunderland, of one of the earliest football paintings in the world \u2013 possibly the earliest \u2013 when in 1895 the artist Thomas M. M. Hemy painted a picture of a game between the teams at Sunderland's then ground Newcastle Road.\nA number of television programmes have included references to Aston Villa over the past few decades. In the sitcom \"Porridge\", the character Lennie Godber is a Villa supporter. When filming began on \"Dad's Army\", Villa fan Ian Lavender was allowed to choose Frank Pike's scarf from an array in the BBC wardrobe; he chose a claret and blue one \u2013 Aston Villa's colours. The character Nessa in the BBC sitcom \"Gavin &amp; Stacey\" was revealed as an Aston Villa fan in an episode screened in December 2009.\nIn the 1952 film \"The Card\", the main character Denry Machin (Alec Guinness) becomes a town councillor and purchases the rights to locally born Aston Villa player 'Callear', the \"greatest centre-forward in England\", for the failing local football club.\nVilla have also featured on several occasions in prose. Stanley Woolley, a character in Derek Robinson's Booker shortlisted novel \"Goshawk Squadron\" is an Aston Villa fan and names a pre-war starting eleven Villa side. Together with The Oval, Villa Park is referenced by the poet Philip Larkin in his poem about the First World War, MCMXIV. Aston Villa are also mentioned in Harold Pinter's play \"The Dumb Waiter\".\nThe club receive a passing mention in Aldous Huxley's debut novel \"Crome Yellow\".\nNotable supporters of Aston Villa include Prince William, former Prime Minister David Cameron, musicians Ozzy Osbourne and Geezer Butler of Black Sabbath, actor Tom Hanks, violinist Nigel Kennedy, golfer Justin Rose, and Harry Potter actors David Bradley and Oliver Phelps.\nAston Villa Women.\nAston Villa have a women's football side that compete in the Women's Super League having been promoted as champions of the 2019-20 FA Women's Championship. They were founded as Solihull F.C. in 1973 and affiliated to Aston Villa in 1989.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n Specific\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n Works cited"}
{"id": "42175", "revid": "40968262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42175", "title": "Population transfer", "text": "Movement of a large group of people from one region to another\nPopulation transfer or resettlement is a type of mass migration that is often imposed by a state policy or international authority. Such mass migrations are most frequently spurred on the basis of ethnicity or religion, but they also occur due to economic development. Banishment or exile is a similar process, but is forcibly applied to individuals and groups. Population transfer differs more than simply technically from individually motivated migration, but at times of war, the act of fleeing from danger or famine often blurs the differences.\nOften the affected population is transferred by force to a distant region, perhaps not suited to their way of life, causing them substantial harm. In addition, the process implies the loss of immovable property and substantial amounts of movable property when rushed. This transfer may be motivated by the more powerful party's desire to make other uses of the land in question or, less often, by security or disastrous environmental or economic conditions that require relocation.\nThe first known population transfers date back to the Middle Assyrian Empire in the 13th century BCE, with forced resettlement being particularly prevalent during the Neo-Assyrian Empire. The single largest population transfer in history was the Partition of India in 1947 that involved up to 12 million people in Punjab Province with a total of up to 20 million people across British India, with the second largest being the flight and expulsion of Germans after World War II, which involved more than 12 million people.\nBefore the forcible deportation of Ukrainians (including thousands of children) to Russia during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the last major population transfer in Europe was the deportation of 800,000 ethnic Albanians during the Kosovo War in 1999. Moreover, some of the largest population transfers in Europe have been attributed to the ethnic policies of the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin.\nPopulation transfers can also be imposed to further economic development, for instance China relocated 1.3 million residents in order to construct the Three Gorges Dam.\nHistorical background.\nThe earliest known examples of population transfers took place in the context of war and empire. As part of Sennacherib's campaign against King Hezekiah of Jerusalem (701 BCE) \"200,150 people great and small, male and female\" were transferred to other lands in the Neo-Assyrian Empire. Similar population transfers occurred under the Achaemenid and Byzantine Empires. Population transfers are considered incompatible with the values of post-Enlightenment European societies, but this was usually limited to the home territory of the colonial power itself and population transfers continued in European colonies during the 20th century.\nSpecific types of population transfer.\nPopulation exchange.\nPopulation exchange is the transfer of two populations in opposite directions at about the same time. In theory at least, the exchange is non-forcible, but the reality of the effects of these exchanges has always been unequal, and at least one half of the so-called \"exchange\" has usually been forced by the stronger or richer participant. Such exchanges have taken place several times in the 20th century:\nEthnic dilution.\nEthnic dilution is the practice of enacting immigration policies to relocate parts of an ethnically and/or culturally dominant population into a region populated by an ethnic minority or otherwise culturally different or non-mainstream group to dilute and eventually to transform the native ethnic population into the mainstream culture over time.\nChanges in international law.\nAccording to the political scientist Norman Finkelstein, population transfer was considered as an acceptable solution to the problems of ethnic conflict until around World War II and even for a time afterward. Transfer was considered a drastic but \"often necessary\" means to end an ethnic conflict or ethnic civil war. The feasibility of population transfer was hugely increased by the creation of railroad networks from the mid-19th century. George Orwell, in his 1946 essay \"Politics and the English Language\" (written during the World War II evacuation and expulsions in Europe), observed:\n\"In our time, political speech and writing are largely the defence of the indefensible. Things... can indeed be defended, but only by arguments which are too brutal for most people to face, and which do not square with the professed aims of political parties. Thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness... Millions of peasants are robbed of their farms and sent trudging along the roads with no more than they can carry: this is called \"transfer of population\" or \"rectification of frontiers\".\"\nThe view of international law on population transfer underwent considerable evolution during the 20th century. Prior to World War II, many major population transfers were the result of bilateral treaties and had the support of international bodies such as the League of Nations. The expulsion of Germans after World War II from Central and Eastern Europe after World War II was sanctioned by the Allies in Article 13 of the Potsdam communiqu\u00e9, but research has shown that both the British and the American delegations at Potsdam strongly objected to the size of the population transfer that had already taken place and was accelerating in the summer of 1945. The principal drafter of the provision, Geoffrey Harrison, explained that the article was intended not to approve the expulsions but to find a way to transfer the competence to the Control Council in Berlin to regulate the flow.\nThe tide started to turn when the Charter of the Nuremberg Trials of German Nazi leaders declared forced deportation of civilian populations to be both a war crime and a crime against humanity. That opinion was progressively adopted and extended through the remainder of the century. Underlying the change was the trend to assign rights to individuals, thereby limiting the rights of states to make agreements that adversely affect them.\nThere is now little debate about the general legal status of involuntary population transfers: \"Where population transfers used to be accepted as a means to settle ethnic conflict, today, forced population transfers are considered violations of international law.\" No legal distinction is made between one-way and two-way transfers since the rights of each individual are regarded as independent of the experience of others.\n of the Fourth Geneva Convention (adopted in 1949 and now part of customary international law) prohibits mass movement of protected persons out of or into territory under belligerent military occupation:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the Occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive... The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.\nAn interim report of the United Nations Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities (1993) says:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Historical cases reflect a now-foregone belief that population transfer may serve as an option for resolving various types of conflict, within a country or between countries. The agreement of recognized States may provide one criterion for the authorization of the final terms of conflict resolution. However, the cardinal principle of \"voluntariness\" is seldom satisfied, regardless of the objective of the transfer. For the transfer to comply with human rights standards as developed, prospective transferees must have an option to remain in their homes if they prefer.\nThe same report warned of the difficulty of ensuring true voluntariness:\n\"some historical transfers did not call for forced or compulsory transfers, but included options for the affected populations. Nonetheless, the conditions attending the relevant treaties created strong moral, psychological and economic pressures to move.\"\nThe final report of the Sub-Commission (1997) invoked numerous legal conventions and treaties to support the position that population transfers contravene international law unless they have the consent of both the moved population and the host population. Moreover, that consent must be given free of direct or indirect negative pressure.\n\"Deportation or forcible transfer of population\" is defined as a crime against humanity by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (Article 7). The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has indicted and sometimes convicted a number of politicians and military commanders indicted for forced deportations in that region.\nEthnic cleansing encompasses \"deportation or forcible transfer of population\" and the force involved may involve other crimes, including crimes against humanity. Nationalist agitation can harden public support, one way or the other, for or against population transfer as a solution to current or possible future ethnic conflict, and attitudes can be cultivated by supporters of either plan of action with its supportive propaganda used as a typical political tool by which their goals can be achieved.\nIn Europe.\nFrance.\nTwo famous transfers connected with the history of France are the banning of the religion of the Jews in 1308 and that of the Huguenots, French Protestants by the Edict of Fontainebleau in 1685. Religious warfare over the Protestants led to many seeking refuge in the Low Countries, England and Switzerland. In the early 18th century, some Huguenots emigrated to colonial America. In both cases, the population was not forced out but rather their religion was declared illegal and so many left the country.\nAccording to Ivan Sertima, Louis XV ordered all blacks to be deported from France but was unsuccessful. At the time, they were mostly free people of color from the Caribbean and Louisiana colonies, usually descendants of French colonial men and African women. Some fathers sent their mixed-race sons to France to be educated or gave them property to be settled there. Others entered the military, as did Thomas-Alexandre Dumas, the father of Alexandre Dumas.\nSome Algerians were also forcefully removed from their native land by France in the late 19th century, and moved to the Pacific, most notably to New Caledonia.\nIreland.\nAfter the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland and Act of Settlement in 1652, most indigenous Irish Catholic land holders had their lands confiscated and were banned from living in planted towns. An unknown number, possibly as high as 100,000 Irish were removed to the colonies in the West Indies and North America as indentured servants.\nIn addition, the Crown supported a series of population transfers into Ireland to enlarge the loyal Protestant population of Ireland. Known as the plantations, they had migrants come chiefly from Scotland and the northern border counties of England. In the late eighteenth century, the Scots-Irish constituted the largest group of immigrants from the British Isles to enter the Thirteen Colonies before the American Revolutionary War.\nScotland.\nThe enclosures that depopulated rural England in the British Agricultural Revolution started during the Middle Ages. Similar developments in Scotland have lately been called the Lowland Clearances.\nThe Highland Clearances were forced displacements of the populations of the Scottish Highlands and Scottish Islands in the 18th century. They led to mass emigration to the coast, the Scottish Lowlands and abroad, including to the Thirteen Colonies, Canada and the Caribbean.\nCentral Europe.\nHistorically, expulsions of Jews and of Romani people reflect the power of state control that has been applied as a tool, in the form of expulsion edicts, laws, mandates etc., against them for centuries.\nAfter the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact divided Poland during World War II, Germans deported Poles and Jews from Polish territories annexed by Nazi Germany, and the Soviet Union deported Poles from areas of Eastern Poland, Kresy to Siberia and Kazakhstan. From 1940, Adolf Hitler tried to get Germans to resettle from the areas in which they were the minority (the Baltics, South-Eastern and Eastern Europe) to the Warthegau, the region around Pozna\u0144, German \"Posen\". He expelled the Poles and Jews who formed there the majority of the population. Before the war, the Germans were 16% of the population in the area.\nThe Nazis initially tried to press Jews to emigrate and in Austria succeeded in driving out most of the Jewish population. However, increasing foreign resistance brought the plan to a virtual halt. Later on, Jews were transferred to ghettoes and eventually to death camps. Use of forced labor in Nazi Germany during World War II occurred on a large scale. Jews who had signed over properties in Germany and Austria during Nazism, although coerced to do so, found it nearly impossible to be reimbursed after World War II, partly because of the ability of governments to make the \"personal decision to leave\" argument.\nThe Germans abducted about 12 million people from almost twenty European countries; about two thirds of whom came from Eastern Europe.\nAfter World War II, when the Curzon line, which had been proposed in 1919 by the Western Allies as Poland's eastern border, was implemented, members of all ethnic groups were transferred to their respective new territories (Poles to Poland, Ukrainians to Soviet Ukraine). The same applied to the formerly-German territories east of the Oder-Neisse line, where German citizens were transferred to Germany. Germans were expelled from areas annexed by the Soviet Union and Poland as well as territories of Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania and Yugoslavia. From 1944 until 1948, between 13.5 and 16.5 million Germans were expelled, evacuated or fled from Central and Eastern Europe. The Statistisches Bundesamt (federal statistics office) estimates the loss of life at 2.1 million \nPoland and Soviet Ukraine conducted population exchanges. Poles residing east of the new Poland-Soviet border were deported to Poland (2,100,000 persons), and Ukrainians that resided west of the New border were deported to Soviet Ukraine. Population transfer to Soviet Ukraine occurred from September 1944 to May 1946 (450,000 persons). Some Ukrainians (200,000 persons) left southeast Poland more or less voluntarily (between 1944 and 1945). The second event occurred in 1947 under Operation Vistula.\nNearly 20 million people in Europe fled their homes or were expelled, transferred or exchanged during the process of sorting out ethnic groups between 1944 and 1951.\nSpain.\nIn 1492 the Jewish population of Spain was expelled through the Alhambra Decree. Some of the Jews went to North Africa; others east into Poland, France and Italy, and other Mediterranean countries.\nIn 1609, was the Expulsion of the Moriscos, the final transfer of 300,000 Muslims out of Spain, after more than a century of Catholic trials, segregation, and religious restrictions. Most of the Spanish Muslims went to North Africa and to areas of Ottoman Empire control.\nSoutheastern Europe.\nIn September 1940, with the return of Southern Dobruja by Romania to Bulgaria under the Treaty of Craiova, a population exchange was carried out. 103,711 Romanians, Aromanians and Megleno-Romanians were compelled to move north of the border, while 62,278 Bulgarians living in Northern Dobruja were forced to move into Bulgaria.\nAround 360,000 Bulgarian Turks fled Bulgaria during the Revival Process.\nDuring the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s, the breakup of Yugoslavia caused large population transfers, mostly involuntary. As it was a conflict fueled by ethnic nationalism, people of minority ethnicities generally fled towards regions that their ethnicity was the majority.\nThe phenomenon of \"ethnic cleansing\" was first seen in Croatia but soon spread to Bosnia. Since the Bosnian Muslims had no immediate refuge, they were arguably the hardest hit by the ethnic violence. United Nations tried to create \"safe areas\" for Muslim populations of eastern Bosnia but in the Srebrenica massacre and elsewhere, the peacekeeping troops failed to protect the \"safe areas\", resulting in the massacre of thousands of Muslims.\nThe Dayton Accords ended the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, fixing the borders between the two warring parties roughly to those established by the autumn of 1995. One immediate result of the population transfer after the peace deal was a sharp decline in ethnic violence in the region.\nA massive and systematic deportation of Serbia's Albanians took place during the Kosovo War of 1999, with around 800,000 Albanians (out of a population of about 1.5 million) forced to flee Kosovo. Albanians became the majority in Kosovo at the wars end, around 200,000 Serbs and Roma fled Kosovo. When Kosovo proclaimed independence in 2008, the bulk of its population was Albanian.\nA number of commanders and politicians, notably Serbia and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, were put on trial by the UN's International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia for a variety of war crimes, including deportations and genocide.\nGreece and Turkey.\nFollowing the Greco-Turkish War of 1919\u20131922, the League of Nations defined those to be mutually expelled as the \"Muslim inhabitants of Greece\" to Turkey and moving \"the Christian Orthodox inhabitants of Turkey\" to Greece. The plan met with fierce opposition in both countries and was condemned vigorously by a large number of countries. Undeterred, Fridtjof Nansen worked with both Greece and Turkey to gain their acceptance of the proposed population exchange. About 1.5 million Christians and half a million Muslims were moved from one side of the international border to the other.\nWhen the exchange was to take effect (1 May 1923), most of the prewar Orthodox Greek population of Aegean Turkey had already fled due to persecution and the Greek Genocide, and so only the Orthodox Christians of central Anatolia (both Greek and Turkish-speaking), and the Pontic Greeks were involved, a total of roughly 189,916. The total number of Muslims involved was 354,647.\nThe population transfer prevented further attacks on minorities in the respective states, and Nansen was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize. As a result of the transfers, the Muslim minority in Greece and the Greek minority in Turkey were much reduced. Cyprus and the Dodecanese were not included in the Greco-Turkish population transfer of 1923 because they were under direct British and Italian control respectively. For the fate of Cyprus, see below. The Dodecanese became part of Greece in 1947.\nItaly.\nIn 1939, Hitler and Mussolini agreed to give the German-speaking population of South Tyrol a choice (the South Tyrol Option Agreement): they could emigrate to neighbouring Germany (including the recently annexed Austria) or stay in Italy and accept to be assimilated. Because of the outbreak of World War II, the agreement was only partially consummated.\nCyprus.\nAfter the Turkish invasion of Cyprus and subsequent division of the island, there was an agreement between the Greek representative on one side and the Turkish Cypriot representative on the other side under the auspices of the United Nations on August 2, 1975. The Government of the Republic of Cyprus would lift any restrictions in the voluntary movement of Turkish Cypriots to the Turkish-occupied areas of the island, and in exchange, the Turkish Cypriot side would allow all Greek Cypriots who remained in the occupied areas to stay there and to be given every help to live a normal life.\nAround 150,000 people (amounting to more than one-quarter of the total population of Cyprus, and to one-third of its Greek Cypriot population) were displaced from the northern part of the island, where Greek Cypriots had constituted 80% of the population. Over the course of the next year, roughly 60,000 Turkish Cypriots, amounting to half the Turkish Cypriot population, were displaced from the south to the north.\nSoviet Union.\nShortly before, during and immediately after World War II, Joseph Stalin conducted a series of deportations on a huge scale, which profoundly affected the ethnic map of the Soviet Union. Over 1.5 million people were deported to Siberia and the Central Asian republics. Separatism, resistance to Soviet rule and collaboration with the invading Germans were cited as the main official reasons for the deportations. After World War II, the population of East Prussia was replaced by the Soviet one, mainly by Russians. Many Tartari Muslims were transferred to Northern Crimea, now Ukraine, while Southern Crimea and Yalta were populated with Russians.\nAt the conclusion of the Yalta Conference, the Allies made numerous promises, one of them was their promise to return all Soviet citizens who found themselves in the Allied zone to the Soviet Union (Operation Keelhaul). That policy immediately affected the Soviet prisoners of war who were liberated by the Allies, and it was extended to all Eastern European refugees. Outlining the plan to force refugees to return to the Soviet Union, the codicil was kept secret from the American and British people for over 50 years.\nUkraine.\nHundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have reportedly been forcibly deported to Russia during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Because of Russia's deporting of thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia, the international criminal court issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin the president of Russia and Maria Lvova-Belova Russia's commissioner for children's rights. As of 21 November 2023 there was 6,338,100 Ukrainian refugees fleeing the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Most (5,946,000) have gone to European countries but a minority (392,100) went to countries outside of Europe.\nIn the Americas.\nInca Empire.\nThe Inca Empire dispersed conquered ethnic groups throughout the empire to break down traditional community ties and force the heterogeneous population to adopt the Quechua language and culture. Never fully successful in the pre-Columbian era, the totalitarian policies had their greatest success when they were adopted, from the 16th century, to create a pan-Andean identity defined against Spanish rule. Much of the current knowledge of Inca population transfers comes from their description by the Spanish chroniclers Pedro Cieza de Le\u00f3n and Bernab\u00e9 Cobo.\nThe Spanish conquerors continued these Inca policies settling for example thousands of indigenous yanakuna from what is today Ecuador, Bolivia and Peru in the newly conquered central Chile. In 1666 the Spanish resettled the Quilmes people from the vicinity of San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n more than 1,000 km southeast in Quilmes next to Buenos Aires.\nCanada.\nDuring the French and Indian War (the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War between Great Britain and France), the British forcibly relocated approximately 8,000 Acadians from the Canadian Maritime Provinces, first to the Thirteen Colonies and then to France. Thousands died of drowning, starvation, or illness as a result of the deportation. Some of the Acadians who had been relocated to France then emigrated to Louisiana, where their descendants became part of the French-American cultural group known as Cajuns.\nBeginning with the Indian Act, but underlying federal and provincial policies towards Indigenous peoples throughout the 1800s and 1900s, the Canadian Government pursued a deliberate policy of forced relocation against hundreds of Indigenous communities. The Canadian Indian residential school system and the Indian reserve system (which forced Indigenous peoples off traditional territories and into small parcels of crown land in order to establish agricultural and industrial developments, and to begin the process of settler colonialism) are key to this history and have been seen by many scholars as evidence of the government's intent to \"extinguish Aboriginal title through administrative and bureaucratic means\". The efforts to displace Indigenous peoples from their traditional territories were also carried out by more brutal means. The Pass system, which controlled the supply of food and resources, movement in and out of reserve lands, and all other aspects of Indigenous peoples' lives, was implemented via the Indian Act in direct response to the 1885 North-West Rebellion, in which Cree, Metis, and other Indigenous peoples resisted the seizure of land and rights by the government. The North-West Mounted Police, precursor to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, were likewise established as a direct response to Indigenous resistance against colonialism. Their purview was to carry out John A. Macdonald's colonial and national policies, especially in Rupert's Land, what would become the Prairie provinces. \nThe High Arctic relocation took place during the Cold War in the 1950s, when 87 Inuit were moved by the Government of Canada to the High Arctic. The relocation has been a source of controversy, and is an understudied aspect of forced migration instigated by the Canadian federal government to assert its sovereignty in the Far North against the Soviet Union. Relocated Inuit peoples were not given sufficient support and were not given a say in their relocation.\nNumerous other indigenous peoples of Canada have been forced to relocate their communities to different reserve lands, including the 'Nak'waxda'xw in 1964.\nJapanese Canadian internment.\nJapanese Canadian Internment refers to the detainment of Japanese Canadians following the attack on Pearl Harbor and the Canadian declaration of war on Japan during World War II. The forced relocation subjected Japanese Canadians to government-enforced curfews and interrogations and job and property losses. The internment of Japanese Canadians was ordered by Prime Minister Mackenzie King, largely because of existing racism. However, evidence supplied by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Department of National Defence show that the decision was unwarranted.\nUntil 1949, four years after World War II had ended, all persons of Japanese heritage were systematically removed from their homes and businesses and sent to internment camps. The Canadian government shut down all Japanese-language newspapers, took possession of businesses and fishing boats, and effectively sold them. To fund the internment itself, vehicles, houses, and personal belongings were also sold.\nUnited States.\nIndependence.\nDuring and after the American Revolutionary War, many Loyalists were deprived of life, liberty or property or suffered lesser physical harm, sometimes under acts of attainder and sometimes by main force. Parker Wickham and other Loyalists developed a well-founded fear. As a result, many chose or were forced to leave their former homes in what became the United States, often going to Canada, where the Crown promised them land in an effort at compensation and resettlement. Most were given land on the frontier in what became Upper Canada and had to create new towns. The communities were largely settled by people of the same ethnic ancestry and religious faith. In some cases, towns were started by men of particular military units and their families.\nNative American relocations.\nIn the 19th century, the United States government removed an estimated number of 100,000 Native Americans to federally owned and federally designated Indian reservations. Native Americans were removed from the Eastern to the Western States. The most well-known removals were those of the 1830s from the Southeast, starting with the Choctaw people. Under the 1830 Indian Removal Act, the Five Civilized Tribes were relocated from their place, east of the Mississippi River, to the Indian Territory in the west. The process resulted in great social dislocation for all, numerous deaths, and the \"Trail of Tears\" for the Cherokee Nation. Resistance to Indian removal led to several violent conflicts, including the Second Seminole War in Florida.\nAs part of the California Genocide, in August 1863, all Konkow Maidu were to be sent to the Bidwell Ranch in Chico and then be taken to the Round Valley Reservation at Covelo in Mendocino County. Any Indians remaining in the area were to be shot. Maidu were rounded up and marched under guard west out of the Sacramento Valley and through to the Coastal Range. 461 Native Americans started the trek, 277 finished. They reached Round Valley on 18 September 1863.\nThe Long Walk of the Navajo refers to the 1864 relocation of the Navajo people by the US government in a forced walk from their land in what is now Arizona to eastern New Mexico. The Yavapai people were forcibly marched from Camp Verde Reservation to San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation, Arizona, on February 27, 1875, following the Yavapai War. The federal government restricted Plains Indians to reservations following several Indian Wars in which Indians and European Americans fought over lands and resources. Indian prisoners of war were held at Fort Marion and Fort Pickens in Florida.\nAfter the Yavapai Wars 375 Yavapai perished in Indian Removal deportations out of 1,400 remaining Yavapai.\nGeneral Order No. 11 (1863).\nGeneral Order No. 11 is the title of a Union Army decree which was issued during the American Civil War on 25 August 1863, forcing the evacuation of rural areas in four counties in western Missouri. That decree was issued in response to an extensive insurgency and widespread guerrilla warfare. The Army cleared the area in an attempt to deprive the guerrillas of local support. Union General Thomas Ewing issued the order, which affected all rural residents regardless of their loyalty. Those who could prove their loyalty to the Union were permitted to stay in the region but had to leave their farms and move to communities near military outposts. Those who could not do so had to vacate the area altogether.\nIn the process, Union forces caused considerable property destruction and a large number of deaths because of conflicts.\nJapanese American internment.\nIn the wake of the Empire of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, decades-long suspicions and antagonisms towards ethnic Japanese mounted, causing the US government to order the military to forcibly relocate approximately 110,000 Japanese Americans along with Japanese nationals who were residing in the United States to newly constructed \"War Relocation Camps,\" or internment camps, in 1942, where they were interned for the duration of the war. White Americans frequently bought their property at losses.\nJapanese nationals and Japanese Americans who were residing on the West Coast of the United States were all interned. In Hawaii, where more than 150,000 Japanese Americans composed nearly a third of that territory's population, officials only interned 1,200 to 1,800 Japanese Americans. In the late 20th century, the US government paid some compensation to the survivors of the internment camps.\nIn Asia.\nOttoman Empire.\nThe Ottoman Empire colonized newly conquered territories by deportation (\"s\u00fcrg\u00fcn\") and resettlement, often to populate empty lands and establish settlements in logistically useful places. The term \"s\u00fcrg\u00fcn\" is known to us from Ottoman documents and comes from the verb \"s\u00fcrmek\" (to displace). This type of resettlement primarily aimed to support daily governance of the Empire, but sometimes population transfers had ethnic or political concerns.\nDuring Mehmet I's reign Tatar and Turkmen subjects were moved to the Balkans to secure areas along the border with Christian Europe. Conquered Christians were moved to Anatolia and Thrace. These population transfers continued into the reigns of Murad II and Mehmet II.\nAfter Murad II's conquest of Salonika, Muslims were involuntarily relocated to Salonika, mostly from Anatolia and Yenice-i Vardar.\nMehmed the Conqueror resettled not only Muslims, but Christians and Jews as well, in his efforts to repopulate the city of Constantinople after its conquest in 1453.\nAccording to the deportation decree issued in newly conquered Cyprus on 24 September 1572, one family out of every ten in the provinces of Anatolia, Rum (Sivas), Karaman and Z\u00fclkadriye were to be sent to Cyprus. These deportees were craftsmen or peasants. In exchange for relocating they would be exempt from taxes for two years.\nFrom Bayezid II (d. 1512), the empire had difficulty with the heterodox Qizilbash movement in eastern Anatolia. The forced relocation of the Qizilbash continued until at least the end of the 16th century. Selim I (d. 1520) ordered merchants, artisans, and scholars transported to Constantinople from Tabriz and Cairo. The state mandated Muslim immigration to Rhodes and Cyprus after their conquests in 1522 and 1571, respectively, and resettled Greek Cypriots onto Anatolia's coast.\nKnowledge among Western historians about the use of \"s\u00fcrg\u00fcn\" from the 17th through the 19th century is somewhat unreliable. It appears that the state did not use forced population transfers as much as during its expansionist period.\nAfter the exchanges in the Balkans, the Great Powers and then the League of Nations used forced population transfer as a mechanism for homogeneity in the post-Ottoman Balkans to decrease conflict. The Norwegian diplomat Fridtjof Nansen, working with the League of Nations as a High Commissioner for Refugees in 1919, proposed the idea of a forced population transfer. That was modelled on the earlier Greek-Bulgarian mandatory population transfer of Greeks in Bulgaria to Greece and of Bulgarians in Greece to Bulgaria.\nPalestine.\nIn 1937 the British Peel Commission recommended partition of Mandatory Palestine which would have entailed a population transfer of Jews and Arabs, and the 1947 UN Partition Plan for Palestine also would have entailed a similar transfer of populations.\nThe 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight, also known as \"the Nakba\", was the displacement of an estimated 700,000-750,000 Palestinian Arabs during the 1948 Palestine war. Refugees resettled in the Gaza Strip (under Egyptian control) and the West Bank (under Jordanian control), Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. Population displacement in the 1948 war affected some Jewish communities as well such as in Gush Etzion and East Jerusalem following Jordan\u2019s annexation of the West Bank.\nThere were further expulsions of Palestinians from 1949 to 1956. And in the 1967 Six-Day War an additional 280,000\u2013325,000 Palestinians were expelled, many of them already refugees from 1948.\nPersia.\nRemoval of populations from along their borders with the Ottomans in Kurdistan and the Caucasus was of strategic importance to the Safavids. Hundreds of thousands of Kurds, along with large groups of Armenians, Assyrians, Azeris, and Turkmens, were forcibly removed from the border regions and resettled in the interior of Persia.That was a means of cutting off contact with other members of the groups across the borders as well as limiting passage of peoples. Under Tahmasp I the Safavids deported a huge portion of the Kurdish population in Anatolia to Khorasan, creating the modern Khorasani Kurds. Some Kurdish tribes were deported farther east, into Gharjistan in the Hindu Kush mountains of Afghanistan, about 1500 miles away from their former homes in western Kurdistan.\nAncient Assyria.\nIn the ancient world, population transfer was the more humane alternative to putting all the males of a conquered territory to death and enslaving the women and children. From the 13th century BCE, Assyria used mass deportation as a punishment for rebellions. By the 9th century BCE, the Assyrians regularly deported thousands of restless subjects to other lands. Assyria forcibly resettled the inhabitants of the Northern Kingdom of Israel in 720 BCE; these became known as the Ten Lost Tribes.\nIndian subcontinent.\nWhen British India was going through an independence movement prior to the Second World War, some pro-Muslim organisations (most notably the Muslim League) demanded a Muslim state consisting of two non-contiguous territories: East Pakistan and West Pakistan. To facilitate the creation of new states along religious lines (as opposed to racial or linguistic lines as people shared common histories and languages), population exchanges between India and Pakistan were implemented. More than 5 million Hindus and Sikhs moved from present-day Pakistan to present-day India, and the same number of Muslims moved the other way. A large number of people, more than a million by some estimates, died in the accompanying violence. Despite the movement of large number of Muslims to Pakistan, an equal number of Muslims chose to stay in India. However, most of the Hindu and Sikh population in Pakistan moved to India in the following years. The Muslim immigrants to Pakistan mostly settled in Karachi and became known as the Urdu speaking Muhajir community.\nFrom 1989 to 1992, the ethnic Hindu Kashmiri Pandit population was forcibly moved out of Kashmir by a minority Urdu-speaking Muslims. The imposition of Urdu led to a decline of usage of local languages such as Kashmiri and Dogri. The resultant violence led to the death of many Hindus and the exodus of nearly all Hindus.\nOn the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia between 1967 and 1973, the British government forcibly removed 2000 Chagossian islanders to make way for a U.S. Armed Forces base. Despite court judgments in their favour, they have not been allowed to return from their exile in Mauritius, but there are signs that financial compensation and an official apology are being considered by the British government.\nAfghanistan.\nIn the 1880s, Abdur Rahman Khan moved the rebellious Ghilzai Pashtuns from the southern part of the country to the northern part. In addition, Abdur Rahman and his successors encouraged Pashtuns, with various incentives, to settle into northern Afghanistan in the late 19th and 20th centuries.\nCambodia.\nOne of the Khmer Rouge's first acts was to move most of the urban population into the countryside. Phnom Penh, its population of 2.5 million people including as many as 1.5 million wartime refugees living with relatives or in urban area, was soon nearly empty. Similar evacuations occurred at Battambang, Kampong Cham, Siem Reap, Kampong Thom and throughout the country's other towns and cities. The Khmer Rouge attempted to turn Cambodia into a classless society by depopulating cities and forcing the urban population (\"New People\") into agricultural communes. The entire population was forced to become farmers in labor camps.\nCaucasia.\nIn the Caucasian region of the former Soviet Union, ethnic population transfers have affected many thousands of individuals in Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan proper; in Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Georgia proper and in Chechnya and adjacent areas within Russia.\nIn Africa.\nEthiopia.\nIn the context of the 1983\u20131985 famine in Ethiopia thousands of people were resettled from northern to southern Ethiopia. The official reason given by the government was that people would be moved from the drought-affected northern regions to the south and south-west, where arable land was plentiful. Others argued that resettlement was a ploy to depopulate areas of unrest in the Ethiopian Civil War.\nSouth Africa.\nAfrican people from across southern Africa were forced to move into 'homelands' or Bantustan, which were territories that the white National Party administration of South Africa set aside for black inhabitants of South Africa and South West Africa (now Namibia), as part of its policy of apartheid.\nMozambique.\nWhen Syrah Resources started the Balama mine, an open pit mine for graphite in Cabo Delgado Province in 2015, farmers has to be resettled. By 2025, farmers grievances still remained unsettled leading to protests that eventually led Syrah Resources to suspend operations.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "42178", "revid": "45444893", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42178", "title": "\u00c9amon de Valera", "text": "Irish statesman (1882\u20131975)\n\u00c9amon de Valera ( ; ; first registered as George de Valero; changed some time before 1901 to Edward de Valera; 14 October 1882 \u2013 29 August 1975) was an American-born Irish statesman and political leader. He served as the president of Ireland from 1959 to 1973, and three terms as prime minister (titled as President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State from 1932 to 1937 and as Taoiseach from 1937 to 1948, 1951 to 1954, and 1957 to 1959). He had a leading role in introducing the Constitution of Ireland in 1937, and was a dominant figure in Irish political circles from the early 1930s to the late 1960s, when he served terms as both the head of government and head of state.\nDe Valera was a commandant of the Irish Volunteers (Third Battalion) at Boland's Mill during the 1916 Easter Rising. He was arrested and sentenced to death, but released for a variety of reasons, including his American citizenship and the public response to the British execution of Rising leaders. He returned to Ireland after being jailed in England and became one of the leading political figures of the War of Independence. After the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, de Valera served as the political leader of Anti-Treaty Sinn F\u00e9in until 1926, when he, along with many supporters, left the party to set up Fianna F\u00e1il, a new political party which abandoned the policy of abstentionism from D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann in favour of republicanising the Irish Free State from within.\nFrom there, de Valera went on to be at the forefront of Irish politics until the turn of the 1960s. He took over as president of the Executive Council from W. T. Cosgrave and later became Taoiseach, with the adoption of the Constitution of Ireland in 1937. With a total of 21 years in office, he is the longest serving Irish head of government by total days served in the post. He resigned in 1959 upon his election as president of Ireland. By then, he had been the founding Leader of Fianna F\u00e1il for 33 years and he, along with older founding members, began to take a less prominent role relative to newer ministers such as Jack Lynch, Charles Haughey and Neil Blaney. De Valera served as President of Ireland from 1959 to 1973, two full terms in office.\nDe Valera's political beliefs evolved from militant Irish republicanism to strong social, cultural and fiscal conservatism. He has been characterised as having a stern and unbending, and also devious demeanour. His roles in the Civil War have also been interpreted as making him a divisive figure in Irish history. Biographer Tim Pat Coogan sees his time in power as being characterised by economic and cultural stagnation, while Diarmaid Ferriter argues that the stereotype of de Valera as an austere, cold, and even backward figure was largely manufactured in the 1960s and is misguided.\nEarly life.\n\u00c9amon de Valera was born on 14 October 1882 in Lenox Hill, New York. He was the son of Catherine Coll, who was originally from Bruree, County Limerick, and Juan Vivion de Valera, described on the birth certificate as a Spanish artist born in 1853. Some researchers have placed his father's place of birth in Cuba, while others have suggested other locations; according to Antonio Rivero Taravillo, he was born in Seville, while Ronan Fanning has him born in the Basque Country.\nHe was born at the Nursery and Child's Hospital, Lexington Avenue, a home for destitute orphans and abandoned children.\nHis parents were reportedly married on 18 September 1881 at St Patrick's Church in Jersey City, New Jersey, but archivists have not located any marriage certificate or any birth, baptismal, or death certificate information for anyone called Juan Vivion de Valera (nor for \"de Valeros\", an alternative spelling). On de Valera's original birth certificate, his name is given as George de Valero and his father is listed as Vivion de Valero. Although he was known as Edward de Valera before 1901, an amended birth certificate was issued, when de Valera was an adult, in which his first name was updated to Edward and his father's surname given as \"de Valera\". As a child, he was known as \"Eddie\" or \"Eddy\". An article, published in 2024 in the \"Journal of the Westmeath Archaeological and History Society\", suggested that de Valera's baptismal record and birth certificate were forged by Irish nationalists in New York City in 1916 as part of an effort to spare him from execution.\nAccording to Coll, Juan Vivion died in 1885 leaving Coll and her child in poor circumstances. \u00c9amon was taken to Ireland by his uncle Ned at the age of two. When his mother remarried in the mid-1880s, he was not brought back to live with her, but was reared by his grandmother, Elizabeth Coll, her son Patrick and her daughter Hannie, in Bruree, County Limerick. He was educated locally at Bruree National School, County Limerick, and C.B.S. Charleville, County Cork. Aged sixteen, he won a scholarship. He was not successful in enrolling at two colleges in Limerick, but was accepted at Blackrock College, Dublin, at the instigation of his local curate. Blackrock College has since named one of their six student houses after him.\nHe played rugby at Blackrock and Rockwell College, then for Munster around 1905. He remained a lifelong devotee of rugby, attending international matches even towards the end of his life when he was nearly blind.\nAt the end of his first year at Blackrock College, he was student of the year. He also won further scholarships and exhibitions and in 1903 was appointed teacher of mathematics at Rockwell College, County Tipperary. It was here that de Valera was first given the nickname \"Dev\" by a teaching colleague, Tom O'Donnell. In 1904, he graduated in mathematics from the Royal University of Ireland. He then studied for a year at Trinity College Dublin but, owing to the necessity of earning a living, did not proceed further and returned to teaching, this time at Belvedere College. In 1906, he secured a post as a teacher of mathematics at Carysfort Teachers' Training College for women in Blackrock, Dublin. His applications for professorships in colleges of the National University of Ireland were unsuccessful, but he obtained a part-time appointment at St Patrick's College, Maynooth and also taught mathematics at various Dublin schools, including Castleknock College (1910\u20131911; under the name Edward de Valera) and Belvedere College.\nHis interest in mathematics and science continued later in life, and he was involved in the foundation of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies in 1940, to which he invited scientists such as Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger. He also reportedly did mathematics, while jailed and awaiting possible execution, in 1916.\nThere were occasions when de Valera seriously contemplated the religious life like his half-brother, Fr. Thomas Wheelwright, but ultimately he did not pursue this vocation. As late as 1906, when he was 24 years old, he approached the President of Clonliffe Seminary in Dublin for advice on his vocation. De Valera was throughout his life portrayed as a deeply religious man, and in death asked to be buried in a religious habit. His biographer, Tim Pat Coogan, speculated that questions surrounding de Valera's legitimacy may have been a deciding factor in his not entering religious life. Being illegitimate would have ordinarily been a bar to receiving priestly orders as a secular priest, but not to becoming a priest or religious in some religious orders.\nAs a young \"Gaeilgeoir\" (Irish speaker), de Valera became an activist for the Irish language. In 1908, he joined the \u00c1rdchraobh of Conradh na Gaeilge (the Gaelic League), where he met Sin\u00e9ad Flanagan, a teacher by profession and four years his senior. They were married on 8 January 1910 at St Paul's Church, Arran Quay, Dublin.\nThe couple had five sons: Vivion (1910\u20131982), \u00c9amon (1913\u20131986), Brian (1915\u20131936), R\u00faaidhr\u00ed (1916\u20131978), and Terence (Terry; 1922\u20132007); and two daughters: M\u00e1ir\u00edn (1912\u20131984) and Emer (1918\u20132012). Brian de Valera predeceased his parents.\nEarly political activity.\nWhile he was already involved in the Gaelic revival, de Valera's involvement in the political revolution began on 25 November 1913, when he joined the Irish Volunteers. The organisation was formed to oppose the Ulster Volunteers and ensure the enactment of the Irish Parliamentary Party's Third Home Rule Act won by its leader John Redmond. After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, de Valera rose through the ranks and it was not long before he was elected captain of the Donnybrook branch. Preparations were pushed ahead for an armed revolt, and he was made commandant of the Third Battalion and adjutant of the Dublin Brigade. He took part in the Howth gun-running. He was sworn by Thomas MacDonagh into the oath-bound Irish Republican Brotherhood, which secretly controlled the central executive of the Volunteers. He opposed secret societies, but this was the only way he could be guaranteed full information on plans for the Rising.\nRevolutionary years.\n1916 Easter Rising.\nOn 24 April 1916, the Easter Rising began. Forces commanded by de Valera occupied Boland's Mill on Grand Canal Street in Dublin. His chief task was to cover the southeastern approaches to the city. After a week of fighting, the order came from P\u00e1draig Pearse to surrender. De Valera was court-martialled, convicted, and sentenced to death, but the sentence was immediately commuted to penal servitude for life.\nDe Valera was among the few republican leaders the British did not execute. It has been argued that his life was saved by four facts. First, he was one of the last to surrender and he was held in a different prison from other leaders, thus his execution was delayed by practicalities. Second, the US Consulate in Dublin made representations before his trial (i.e., was he actually a United States citizen and if so, how would the United States react to the execution of one of its citizens?) while the full legal situation was clarified. The UK was trying to bring the US into the war in Europe at the time, and the Irish American vote was important in US politics. Third, when Lt-Gen Sir John Maxwell reviewed his case he said, \"Who is he? I haven't heard of him before. I wonder would he be likely to make trouble in the future?\" On being told that de Valera was unimportant, he commuted the court-martial's death sentence to life imprisonment. De Valera had no Fenian family or personal background and his MI5 file in 1916 was very slim, detailing only his open membership in the Irish Volunteers. Fourth, by the time de Valera was court-martialled on 8 May, political pressure was being brought to bear on Maxwell to halt the executions; Maxwell had already told British Prime Minister H. H. Asquith that only two more were to be executed, Se\u00e1n Mac Diarmada and James Connolly, although they were court-martialled the day after de Valera. His late trial, representations made by the American Consulate, his lack of Fenian background and political pressure all combined to save his life, though had he been tried a week earlier he would probably have been shot.\nDe Valera's supporters and detractors argue about his bravery during the Easter Rising. His supporters claim he showed leadership skills and a capacity for meticulous planning. His detractors claim he suffered a nervous breakdown during the Rising. According to accounts from 1916, de Valera was seen running about, giving conflicting orders, refusing to sleep and on one occasion, having forgotten the password, almost getting himself shot in the dark by his own men. According to one account, de Valera, on being forced to sleep by one subordinate who promised to sit beside him and wake him if he was needed, suddenly woke up, his eyes \"wild\", screaming, \"Set fire to the railway! Set fire to the railway!\" Later in the Ballykinlar internment Camp, one de Valera loyalist approached another internee, a medical doctor, recounted the story, and asked for a medical opinion as to de Valera's condition. He also threatened to sue the doctor, future Fine Gael TD and Minister, Dr. Tom O'Higgins, if he ever repeated the story. The British reportedly, however, considered de Valera's forces the best-trained and best-led among the rebels. De Valera's latest biographer, Anthony J. Jordan, writes of this controversy, \"Whatever happened in Boland's Mills, or any other garrison, does not negate or undermine in any way the extraordinary heroism of \"Dev\" and his comrades\".\nAfter imprisonment in Dartmoor, Maidstone and Lewes prisons, de Valera and his comrades were released under an amnesty in June 1917. On 10 July 1917, he was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for East Clare (the constituency which he represented until 1959) in a by-election caused by the death of the previous incumbent Willie Redmond, brother of the Irish Party leader John Redmond, who had died fighting in World War I. In the 1918 general election he was elected both for that seat and Mayo East. As an abstentionist de Valera would not have gone to Westminster, but was not able to do so regardless because in early 1918 he was again arrested.\nBecause most other Irish rebellion leaders were dead, in 1917 de Valera had been elected President of Sinn F\u00e9in, the party which had been blamed incorrectly for provoking the Easter Rising.This party became the political vehicle through which the survivors of the Easter Rising channelled their republican ethos and objectives. The previous President of Sinn F\u00e9in, Arthur Griffith, had championed an Anglo-Irish dual-monarchy based on the Austro-Hungarian model, with independent legislatures for both Ireland and Britain.\nPresident of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.\nSinn F\u00e9in won a huge majority in the 1918 general election, largely thanks to the British executions of the 1916 leaders, the threat of conscription with the Conscription Crisis of 1918 and the first-past-the-post ballot. They won 73 out of 105 Irish seats, with about 47% of votes cast. 25 seats were uncontested. On 21 January 1919, 27 Sinn F\u00e9in MPs (the rest were imprisoned or impaired), calling themselves Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la (TDs), assembled in the Mansion House in Dublin and formed an Irish parliament, known as D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (translatable into English as the \"Assembly of Ireland\"). The Ministry of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann was formed, under the leadership of the Pr\u00edomh Aire (also called President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann) Cathal Brugha. De Valera had been re-arrested in May 1918 and imprisoned and so could not attend the January session of the D\u00e1il. He escaped from Lincoln Gaol, England in February 1919. As a result, he replaced Brugha as Pr\u00edomh Aire in the April session of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.\nIn the hope of securing international recognition, Se\u00e1n T. O'Kelly was sent as an envoy to Paris to present the Irish case to the Peace Conference convened by the great powers at the end of World War I. When it became clear by May 1919 that this mission could not succeed, de Valera decided to visit the United States. The mission had three objectives: to ask for official recognition of the Irish Republic, to float a loan to finance the work of the Government (and by extension, the Irish Republican Army), and to secure the support of the American people for the republic. His visit lasted from June 1919 to December 1920 and had mixed success, including a visit to Fenway Park in Boston in front of 50,000 supporters. One negative outcome was the splitting of the Irish-American organisations into pro- and anti-de Valera factions. He met the young Harvard-educated leader from Puerto Rico, Pedro Albizu Campos, and forged a lasting and useful alliance with him. It was during this American tour that he recruited his long-serving personal secretary, Kathleen O'Connell, an Irish emigrant who would return to Ireland with him. In October 1919, he visited the University of Notre Dame campus in Indiana, where he planted a tree and also laid a wreath by the statue of William Corby. He toured the university archives and spoke in Washington Hall about the cause of Ireland in front of twelve hundred students.\nDe Valera managed to raise $5,500,000 from American supporters, an amount that far exceeded the hopes of the D\u00e1il. Of this, $500,000 was devoted to the American presidential campaign in 1920, helping him gain wider public support there. In 1921, it was said that $1,466,000 had already been spent, and it is unclear when the net balance arrived in Ireland. Recognition was not forthcoming in the international sphere. He also had difficulties with various Irish-American leaders, such as John Devoy and Judge Daniel F. Cohalan, who resented the dominant position he established, preferring to retain their control over Irish affairs in the United States.\nWhile American recognition for the Republic had been his priority, in February 1921, De Valera redirected Patrick McCartan from Washington to Moscow. McCartan was told by Maxim Litvinov, that the opportunity of recognition and assistance had passed. The Soviet priority was a trade agreement with Britain (signed in March). In June the British government (with a view to both domestic and American opinion) published the proposed treaty between the D\u00e1il government and the Soviets, and related correspondence.\nMeanwhile, in Ireland, the conflict between the British authorities and the D\u00e1il (which the British declared illegal in September 1919), escalated into the Irish War of Independence. De Valera left day-to-day government, during his eighteen-month absence in the United States, to Michael Collins, his 29-year-old Minister for Finance. De Valera and Collins would later become opponents during the Irish Civil War.\nPresident of the Republic.\nIn January 1921, in his first appearance in the D\u00e1il, after his return to a country gripped by the War of Independence, de Valera introduced a motion calling on the IRA to desist from ambushes and other tactics that were allowing the British to successfully portray it as a terrorist group, and to take on the British forces with conventional military methods. This they strongly opposed, and de Valera relented, issuing a statement expressing support for the IRA, and claiming it was fully under the control of the D\u00e1il. He then, along with Cathal Brugha and Austin Stack, brought pressure to bear on Michael Collins to undertake a journey to the United States himself, on the pretext that only he could take up where de Valera had left off. Collins successfully resisted this move and stayed in Ireland. In the May 1921 elections, all candidates in Southern Ireland were returned unopposed, Nationalists and Sinn F\u00e9in secured 12 seats in Northern Ireland including leaders such as de Valera, Michael Collins, Eoin MacNeill and Arthur Griffith.\nFollowing the Truce of July 1921 that ended the war, de Valera went to see Prime Minister David Lloyd George in London on 14 July. No agreement was reached, and by then the Parliament of Northern Ireland had already met. It became clear that neither a republic nor independence for all 32 counties, was going to be offered; Lloyd George told de Valera he could \"put a soldier in Ireland for every man, woman and child in it\" if the IRA did not immediately agree to stop fighting. In August 1921, de Valera secured D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann's approval to change the 1919 D\u00e1il Constitution to upgrade his office from prime minister or chairman of the cabinet to a full President of the Republic. Declaring himself now the Irish equivalent of King George V, he argued that as Irish head of state, in the absence of the British head of state from the negotiations, he too should not attend the peace conference called the Treaty Negotiations (October\u2013December 1921) at which British and Irish government leaders agreed to the effective independence of twenty-six of Ireland's thirty-two counties as the Irish Free State, with Northern Ireland choosing to remain under British sovereignty. It is generally agreed by historians that whatever his motives, it was a mistake for de Valera not to have travelled to London.\nHaving effected these changes, the Irish Boundary Commission met in 1922-25 to redraw the Irish border. Nationalists expected its report to recommend that largely nationalist areas of Northern Ireland (South Armagh, South Down, Derry City and the Counties Tyrone and Fermanagh) become part of the Free State, and many hoped this would make Northern Ireland so small it would not be economically viable. A Council of Ireland was also provided in the Treaty as a model for an eventual all-Irish parliament. Hence neither the pro- nor anti-Treaty sides made many complaints about partition in the Treaty Debates.\nAnglo-Irish Treaty.\nThe Republic's delegates to the Treaty Negotiations were accredited by de Valera and his cabinet as plenipotentiaries (that is, negotiators with the legal authority to sign a treaty without reference back to the cabinet), but were given secret cabinet instructions by de Valera that required them to return to Dublin before signing the Treaty. The Treaty proved controversial in Ireland insofar as it replaced the Republic by a dominion of the British Commonwealth with the King represented by a Governor-General of the Irish Free State. The Irish delegates Arthur Griffith, Robert Barton and Michael Collins supported by Erskine Childers as Secretary-General set up their delegation headquarters at 22 Hans Place in Knightsbridge. It was there, at 11.15\u00a0am on 5 December 1921, that the decision was made to recommend the Treaty to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann. The Treaty was finally signed by the delegates after further negotiations which closed at 02:15 on 6 December 1921.\nDe Valera baulked at the agreement. His opponents claimed that he had refused to join the negotiations because he knew what the outcome would be and did not wish to receive the blame. De Valera claimed that he had not gone to the treaty negotiations because he would be better able to control the extremists at home, and that his absence would allow leverage for the plenipotentiaries to refer back to him and not be pressured into any agreements. Because of the secret instructions given to the plenipotentiaries, he reacted to news of the signing of the Treaty not with anger at its contents (which he refused even to read when offered a newspaper report of its contents), but with anger over the fact that they had not consulted \"him\", their president, before signing. His ideal drafts, presented to a secret session of the D\u00e1il during the Treaty Debates and publicised in January 1922, were ingenious compromises but they included dominion status, the \"Treaty Ports\", the fact of partition subject to veto by the parliament in Belfast, and some continuing status for the King as head of the Commonwealth. Ireland's share of the imperial debt and the payment of war pensions was to be paid.\nAfter the Treaty was narrowly ratified by 64 to 57, de Valera and a large minority of Sinn F\u00e9in TDs left D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann. He then resigned and Arthur Griffith was elected President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann in his place, though respectfully still calling him 'The President'. On a speaking tour of the more republican province of Munster, starting on 17 March 1922, de Valera made controversial speeches at Carrick on Suir, Lismore, Dungarvan and Waterford, saying that: \"\"If the Treaty were accepted,\" [by the electorate] \"the fight for freedom would still go on, and the Irish people, instead of fighting foreign soldiers, will have to fight the Irish soldiers of an Irish government set up by Irishmen.\" At Thurles, several days later, he repeated this imagery and added that the IRA: \"..would have to wade through the blood of the soldiers of the Irish Government, and perhaps through that of some members of the Irish Government to get their freedom.\"\" In a letter to the Irish Independent on 23 March de Valera accepted the accuracy of their report of his comment about \"wading\" through blood, but deplored that the newspaper had published it.\nDe Valera objected to the oath of allegiance to the King that the treaty required Irish parliamentarians to take. He also was concerned that Ireland could not have an independent foreign policy as part of the British Commonwealth when the British retained several naval ports (see Treaty Ports) around Ireland's coast. As a compromise, de Valera proposed \"external association\" with the British Empire, which would leave Ireland's foreign policy in her own hands and a republican constitution with no mention of the British monarch (he proposed this as early as April, well before the negotiations began, under the title \"Document No. 2\"). Michael Collins was prepared to accept this formula and the two wings (pro- and anti-Treaty) of Sinn F\u00e9in formed a pact to fight the 1922 Irish general election together and form a coalition government afterwards. Collins later called off the pact on the eve of the election. De Valera's opponents won the election and civil war broke out shortly afterwards in late June 1922.\nCivil War.\nRelations between the new Irish government, which was backed by most of the D\u00e1il and the electorate, and the anti-treatyites, under the nominal leadership of de Valera, now descended into the Irish Civil War (June 1922 to May 1923), in which the pro-treaty Free State forces defeated the anti-treaty IRA. Both sides had wanted to avoid civil war, but fighting broke out over the takeover of the Four Courts in Dublin by anti-treaty members of the IRA. These men were not loyal to de Valera and initially were not even supported by the executive of the anti-treaty IRA. However, Michael Collins was forced to act against them when Winston Churchill threatened to re-occupy the country with British troops unless action was taken. When fighting broke out in Dublin between the Four Courts garrison and the new Free State Army, republicans backed the IRA men in the Four Courts, and civil war broke out. De Valera, though he held no military position, backed the anti-treaty IRA, or \"irregulars\", and said that he was re-enlisting in the IRA as an ordinary volunteer. On 8 September 1922, he met in secret with Richard Mulcahy in Dublin to try to halt the fighting. However, according to de Valera, they \"could not find a basis\" for agreement.\nThough nominally head of the anti-treatyites, de Valera had little influence. He does not seem to have been involved in any fighting and had little or no influence with the revolutionary military leadership, headed by IRA Chief of Staff Liam Lynch. De Valera and the anti-treaty TDs formed a \"republican government\" on 25 October 1922 from anti-treaty TDs to \"be temporarily the Supreme Executive of the Republic and the State, until such time as the elected Parliament of the Republic can freely assemble, or the people being rid of external aggression are at liberty to decide freely how they are to be governed and what shall be their political relations with other countries\" . However, it had no real authority and was a pale shadow of the D\u00e1il government of 1919\u201321.\nIn March 1923, de Valera attended the meeting of the IRA Army Executive to decide on the future of the war. He was known to be in favour of a truce but he had no voting rights and it was narrowly decided to continue hostilities. The leader of the Free State, W. T. Cosgrave, insisted that there could be no acceptance of a surrender without disarming.\nOn 30 April 1923, the IRA's new chief of staff, Frank Aiken (Lynch had been killed), called a ceasefire. This was followed on 24 May by an order for volunteers to \"dump arms\". De Valera, who had wanted an end to the internecine fighting for some time, backed the ceasefire order with a message in which he called the anti-treaty fighters \"the Legion of the Rearguard\", saying that \"The Republic can no longer be successfully defended by your arms. Further sacrifice on your part would now be in vain and the continuance of the struggle in arms unwise in the national interest and prejudicial to the future of our cause. Military victory must be allowed to rest for the moment with those who have destroyed the republic. Other means must be sought to safeguard the nation's right.\"\nAfter this point, many of the republicans were arrested in Free State round-ups when they had come out of hiding and returned home. De Valera remained in hiding for several months after the ceasefire was declared; however, he emerged in August to stand for election in County Clare. Referring to the Clare electorate he said: \"If the people of Clare elect me as their candidate again, I will be with them and nothing but a bullet will stop me\". Making a campaign appearance in Ennis on 15 August, de Valera was arrested on the platform and interned at Kilmainham jail. He was moved to Arbour Hill barracks briefly prior to his release on 16 July 1924.\nFounding of Fianna F\u00e1il.\nAfter the IRA dumped their arms rather than surrender them or continue a now fruitless war, de Valera returned to political methods. In 1924, he was arrested in Newry for \"illegally entering Northern Ireland\" and later arrested in Derry. When at trial in Belfast on 1 November 1924 he refused to recognize the court saying that it was: \"a creature of a foreign power and therefore had not the sanction of the Irish people\". He was held in solitary confinement for a month in Crumlin Road Gaol, Belfast.\nDuring this time, de Valera came to believe that abstentionism was not a workable tactic in the long term. He now believed that a better course would be to try to gain power and turn the Free State from a constitutional monarchy into a republic. He tried to convince Sinn F\u00e9in to accept this new line. However, a vote to accept the Free State Constitution (contingent on the abolition of the Oath of Allegiance) narrowly failed. Soon afterwards, de Valera resigned from Sinn F\u00e9in and seriously considered leaving politics.\nHowever, one of his colleagues, Se\u00e1n Lemass, convinced de Valera to found a new republican party. In March 1926, with Lemass, Constance Markievicz and others, de Valera formed a new party, Fianna F\u00e1il (\"The Warriors of Destiny\"), a party that was to dominate 20th-century Irish politics. While Sinn F\u00e9in still held to an abstentionist line, Fianna F\u00e1il was dedicated to republicanising the Free State from within if it gained power.\nHaving attracted most of Sinn F\u00e9in's branches due to Lemass' organisational skill, the new party made swift electoral gains in the general election on 9 June 1927. In the process, it took much of Sinn F\u00e9in's previous support, winning 44 seats to Sinn F\u00e9in's five. It refused to take the Oath of Allegiance (portrayed by opponents as an 'Oath of Allegiance to the Crown' but actually an \"Oath of Allegiance to the Irish Free State\" with a secondary \"promise of fidelity to the King in his role in the Treaty settlement\").\nThe oath was largely the work of Collins and based on three sources: British oaths in the dominions, the oath of the Irish Republican Brotherhood and a draft oath prepared by de Valera in his proposed treaty alternative, \"Document No. 2\". De Valera began a legal case to challenge the requirement that members of his party take the Oath, but the assassination of the Vice-President of the Executive Council (deputy prime minister) Kevin O'Higgins on 10 July 1927 led the Executive Council under W. T. Cosgrave to introduce a Bill on 20 July requiring all D\u00e1il candidates to promise on oath that if they were elected they would take the Oath of Allegiance. Forced into a corner, and faced with the option of staying outside politics forever or taking the oath and entering, de Valera and his TDs took the Oath of Allegiance on 12 August 1927, though de Valera himself described the Oath as \"an empty political formula\".\nDe Valera never organised Fianna F\u00e1il in Northern Ireland and it was not until 7 December 2007 that Fianna F\u00e1il was registered there by the UK Electoral Commission.\nPresident of the Executive Council.\nIn the 1932 general election Fianna F\u00e1il secured 72 seats and became the largest party in the D\u00e1il, although without a majority. Some Fianna F\u00e1il members arrived at the first sitting of the new D\u00e1il carrying arms, amid fears that Cumann na nGaedheal would not voluntarily surrender power. However, the transition was peaceful. De Valera was elected President of the Executive Council \"(Prime Minister)\" by the D\u00e1il by a vote of 81\u201368, with the support of the Labour Party and Independent politicians, and took office on 9 March.\nHe at once initiated steps to fulfil his election promises to abolish the oath and withhold land annuities owed to the UK for loans provided under the Irish Land Acts and agreed as part of the 1921 Treaty. This launched the Anglo-Irish Trade War when the UK in retaliation imposed economic sanctions against Irish exports. De Valera responded in kind with levies on British imports. The ensuing \"Economic War\" lasted until 1938.\nAfter De Valera had urged King George V to dismiss McNeill as governor-general, the King suggested an alternative course of action: that McNeill, instead, carry on a while longer as viceroy and only then resign, which he did on 1 November 1932. Subsequently, a 1916 veteran, Domhnall Ua Buachalla, was appointed governor-general. To strengthen his position against the opposition in the D\u00e1il and Seanad, de Valera directed the Governor-General to call a snap election in January 1933 and de Valera's party won 77 seats, giving Fianna F\u00e1il an overall majority. Under de Valera's leadership, Fianna F\u00e1il won further general elections in 1937, 1938, 1943, and 1944.\nDe Valera took charge of Ireland's foreign policy as well by also acting as Minister for External Affairs. In that capacity, he attended meetings of the League of Nations. He was president of the Council of the League on his first appearance at the league in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1932 and, in a speech that made a worldwide impression, appealed for genuine adherence by its members to the principles of the covenant of the league. In 1934, he supported the admission of the Soviet Union into the league. In September 1938, he was elected the nineteenth president of the Assembly of the League, a tribute to the international recognition he had won by his independent stance on world questions.\nDe Valera's government followed the policy of unilaterally dismantling the treaty of 1921. In this way, he would be pursuing republican policies and lessening the popularity of republican violence and the IRA. De Valera encouraged IRA members to join the Irish Defence Forces and the Garda\u00ed. He also refused to dismiss from office those Cumann na nGaedheal, Cosgrave supporters, who had previously opposed him during the Civil War. He did, however, dismiss Eoin O'Duffy from his position as Garda Commissioner after a year. Eoin O'Duffy was then invited to be head of the Army Comrades Association (ACA) formed to protect and promote the welfare of its members, previously led by J.F. O'Higgins, Kevin O'Higgins's brother. This organisation was an obstacle to de Valera's power as it supported Cumann na nGaedheal and provided stewards for their meetings. Cumann na nGaedheal meetings were frequently disrupted by Fianna F\u00e1il supporters following the publication of the article: \"No Free Speech for Traitors\" by Peadar O'Donnell, an IRA member.\nThe ACA changed its name to the \"National Guard\" under O'Duffy and adopted the uniform of black berets and blue shirts, using the straight-armed salute, and were nicknamed the Blueshirts. They were outwardly fascist and planned a march in August 1933 through Dublin to commemorate Michael Collins, Kevin O'Higgins, and Arthur Griffith. This march struck parallels with Mussolini's march on Rome (1922), in which he had created the image of having toppled the democratic government in Rome. De Valera revived a military tribunal, which had been set up by the previous administration, to deal with the matter. O'Duffy backed down when the National Guard was declared an illegal organisation and the march was banned. Within a few weeks, O'Duffy's followers merged with Cumann na nGaedhael and the Centre Party to form \"United Ireland\", or Fine Gael, and O'Duffy became its leader. Smaller local marches were scheduled for the following weeks, under different names. Internal dissension set in when the party's TDs distanced themselves from O'Duffy's extreme views, and his movement fell asunder.\nTaoiseach (1937\u20131948).\nConstitution of Ireland.\nDuring the 1930s, de Valera systematically stripped the Irish Free State constitution \u2013 a constitution originally drafted by a committee under the nominal chairmanship of his rival, Collins \u2013 of features tying Ireland to the United Kingdom, limiting its independence and the republican character of its state. De Valera was able to carry out this program of constitutional change by taking advantage of three earlier modifications of constitutional arrangements. First, though the 1922 constitution originally required a public plebiscite for any amendment enacted more than eight years after its passage, the Free State government under W. T. Cosgrave had amended that period to sixteen years. This meant that, until 1938, the Free State constitution could be amended by the simple passage of a \"Constitutional Amendment Act\" through the Oireachtas. Secondly, while the Governor-General of the Irish Free State could reserve or deny Royal Assent to any legislation, from 1927, the power to advise the Governor-General to do so no longer rested with the British government in London but with His Majesty's Government in the Irish Free State, which meant that, in practice, the Royal Assent was automatically granted to legislation; the government was hardly likely to advise the governor-general to block the enactment of one of its own bills. Thirdly, though in its original theory, the constitution \"had\" to be in keeping with the provisions of the Anglo-Irish Treaty as the fundamental law of the state, that requirement had been abrogated a short time before de Valera gained power.\nThe Oath of Allegiance was abolished, as were appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The opposition-controlled Senate, when it protested and slowed down these measures, was also abolished. In 1931, the British Parliament passed the Statute of Westminster, which all but eliminated the UK Parliament's authority to legislate for the self-governing Dominions of the then British Commonwealth, including the Irish Free State, and gave them legislative equality with the United Kingdom. Though a few constitutional links between the Dominions and the United Kingdom remained, this is often seen as the moment at which the Dominions became fully sovereign states.\nShortly after the Statute passed, Cosgrave sought and received the right to have an Irish minister advise the king on matters related to the Free State to the exclusion of British ministers. This allowed the President of the Executive Council to directly advise the King in his capacity as His Majesty's Irish Prime Minister. in this capacity, De Valera wrote in July 1936 to King Edward VIII in London indicating that he planned to introduce a new constitution, the central part of which was to be the creation of an office de Valera provisionally intended to call \"President of Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann\" (), which would replace the governor-general. De Valera used the sudden abdication of Edward VIII as King to pass two bills: one amended the constitution to remove all mention of the monarch and governor-general, while the second brought the monarch back, this time through statute law, for use in representing the Irish Free State at a diplomatic level. With the implementation of the Constitution of Ireland (), the title ultimately given to the president was \"President of Ireland\" ().\nThe constitution contained reforms and symbols intended to assert Irish sovereignty. These included:\nCriticisms of some of the above constitutional reforms include that:\nAs Paul Bew concludes, in the constitution of 1937 de Valera was \"trying to placate left-wing Republicans with national phrases and pious people with expressly Catholic bits [and] patriarchal Catholicism\".\nThe Constitution was approved in a plebiscite on 1 July 1937 and came into force on 29 December 1937. With Fianna F\u00e1il having won the election held the same day as the plebiscite that ratified the constitution, de Valera continued as President of the Executive Council until 29 December 1937, when the new constitution was enacted. On that date, de Valera's post automatically became that of Taoiseach, which was a considerably more powerful office. Notably, he could advise the president to dismiss ministers individually \u2013 advice that the president was bound to follow by convention. The old executive council had to be dissolved and reformed if its president wanted to remove a minister. Additionally, he could request a parliamentary dissolution on his own authority. Previously, the right to seek a dissolution was vested with the council as a whole.\nIn social policy, de Valera's first period as taoiseach saw the introduction (in 1947) of means-tested allowances for people suffering from infectious diseases.\nAnglo-Irish Trade Agreement.\nWith the new constitution in place, de Valera determined that the changed circumstances made swift resolution to Ireland's ongoing trade war with the UK more desirable for both sides\u2014as did the growing probability of the outbreak of war across Europe. In April 1938, de Valera and British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain signed the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement, lifting all duties imposed during the previous five years and ending British use of the Treaty Ports it had retained in accordance with the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The return of the ports was of particular significance since it ensured Irish neutrality during the coming Second World War.\nThe Emergency (World War II).\nBy September 1939, a general European war was imminent. On 2 September, de Valera advised D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann that neutrality was the best policy for the country. This policy had overwhelming political and popular support, though some advocated Irish participation in the war on the Allied side, while others, believing that \"England's difficulty is Ireland's opportunity\", were pro-German. Strong objections to conscription in the North were voiced by de Valera. In June 1940, to encourage the neutral Irish state to join with the Allies, Winston Churchill indicated to de Valera that the United Kingdom would push for Irish unity, but believing that Churchill could not deliver, de Valera declined the offer. The day after the attacks on Pearl Harbor Churchill wired de Valera: \"Now is your chance. Now or never! A nation once again. I will meet you wherever you wish.\" The British did not inform the Government of Northern Ireland that they had made the offer to the Irish government, and De Valera's rejection was not publicised until 1970. \nThe government secured wide powers for the duration of the Emergency, such as internment, censorship of the press and correspondence, and government control of the economy. The \"Emergency Powers Act\" lapsed on 2 September 1946, though the State of Emergency declared under the constitution was not lifted until the 1970s. This status remained throughout the war, despite pressure from Chamberlain and Churchill. However, de Valera did respond to a request from Northern Ireland for fire tenders to assist in fighting fires following the 1941 Belfast Blitz. His 1943 St Patrick's Day radio address, now widely derided, showcased his traditionalist views, extolling an Ireland \"satisfied with frugal comfort\", populated by \"sturdy children\" and \"happy maidens\".\nControversially, de Valera visited and offered condolences to the German ambassador in Dublin on the death of Adolf Hitler in 1945, in accordance with diplomatic protocol of neutral nations. This did some damage to Ireland's international reputation, particularly in the United States \u2013 and soon afterwards de Valera had a bitter exchange of words with Churchill in two famous radio addresses after the end of the war in Europe. De Valera denounced reports of Bergen-Belsen concentration camp as \"anti-national propaganda\"; according to Bew, this was not out of disbelief but rather because the Holocaust undermined the main assumption underlying Irish neutrality: moral equivalence between the Allies and the Axis.\nThe de Valera government was reputedly harsh with Irish Army deserters who had enlisted to fight with the Allied armies against the Axis. The legislation in question was the Emergency Powers (No. 362) order which was passed in August 1945. On 18 October 1945, Thomas F. O'Higgins moved to annul the order. He did not condone desertion, but felt that the order was specifically harsh on those deserters who had served in the Allied forces. General Richard Mulcahy also spoke against the Order, disagreeing with the way in which it applied to enlisted men and not to officers. It was revoked with effect from 1 August 1946, but was in effect continued by section 13 of the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946.\nPost-war period: Taoiseach/Opposition leader.\nOpposition leader (1948\u20131951).\nAfter de Valera had spent sixteen years in power without answering the crucial questions of partition and republican status the public demanded a change from the Fianna F\u00e1il government. In the 1948 election, de Valera lost the outright majority he had enjoyed since 1933. It initially looked as if the National Labour Party would give Fianna F\u00e1il enough support to stay in office as a minority government, but National Labour insisted on a formal coalition agreement, something de Valera was unwilling to concede. However, while Fianna F\u00e1il was six seats short of a majority, it was still by far the largest party in the D\u00e1il, with 37 more TDs than the next largest party and rival, Fine Gael (the successor to Cumann na nGaedheal). Conventional wisdom held that de Valera would remain Taoiseach with the support of independent deputies.\nThis belief came to nought when (after the final votes were counted) the other parties realised that if they banded together, they would have only one seat fewer than Fianna F\u00e1il, and would be able to form a government with the support of at least seven independents. The result was the First Inter-Party Government, with John A. Costello of Fine Gael as its compromise candidate for Taoiseach. Costello was duly nominated, consigning de Valera to opposition for the first time in 16 years. The following year, Costello declared Ireland as a republic, leaving partition as the most pressing political issue of the day.\nDe Valera, now Leader of the Opposition, left the actual parliamentary practice of opposing the government to his deputy, Se\u00e1n Lemass, and himself embarked on a world campaign to address the issue of partition. He visited the United States, Australia, New Zealand and India, and in the latter country, was the last guest of the governor-general, Lord Mountbatten of Burma, before he was succeeded by the first Indian-born Governor-General. In Melbourne, Australia, de Valera was feted by the powerful Catholic Archbishop Daniel Mannix, at the centenary celebrations of the diocese of Melbourne. He attended mass meetings at Xavier College, and addressed the assembled Melbourne Celtic Club. In Brisbane, Australia, at the request of the influential and long-serving Archbishop Duhig, de Valera laid the foundation stone for the new High School building at Marist Brothers College Rosalie. In October 1950, just thirty years after his dramatic escape from Lincoln Gaol, he returned to Lincoln and received the freedom of the gaol. The Anti-Partition of Ireland League of Great Britain marked the occasion with a dinner in his honour and the toast was 'Anglo-Irish Friendship'. A key message in de Valera's campaign was that Ireland could not join the recently established North Atlantic Treaty Organization as long as Northern Ireland was in British hands; although Costello's government favoured alliance with NATO, de Valera's approach won more widespread support and prevented the state from signing the treaty.\nFinal years as taoiseach.\nReturning to Ireland during the Mother and Child Scheme crisis that racked the First Inter-Party Government, de Valera kept silent as Leader of the Opposition, preferring to stay aloof from the controversy. That stance helped return de Valera to power in the 1951 general election, but without an overall majority. His and Fianna F\u00e1il's popularity was short-lived, however; his government introduced severe, deflationary budgetary and economic policies in 1952, causing a political backlash that cost Fianna F\u00e1il several seats in the D\u00e1il in by-elections of 1953 and early 1954. Faced with a likely loss of confidence in the D\u00e1il, de Valera instead called an election in May 1954, in which Fianna F\u00e1il was defeated and a Second Inter-Party Government was formed with John A. Costello again as Taoiseach.\nOn 16 September 1953, de Valera met British Prime Minister Winston Churchill for the first and only time, at 10 Downing Street. (The two men had seen each other at a party in 1949, but without speaking). He surprised the UK Prime Minister by claiming that if he had been in office in 1948 Ireland would not have left the Commonwealth.\nIt was during this period that de Valera's eyesight began to deteriorate and he was forced to spend several months in the Netherlands, where he had six operations. In 1955, while in opposition, de Valera spoke against the formation of a European Parliament and European federalism, noting that Ireland \"did not strive to get out of that British domination [...] to get into a worse [position]\".\nLike the first coalition government, the second lasted only three years. At the general election of 1957, de Valera, then in his seventy-fifth year, won an absolute majority of nine seats, the greatest number he had ever secured. This was the beginning of another sixteen-year period in office for Fianna F\u00e1il. A new economic policy emerged with the First Programme for Economic Expansion. In July 1957, in response to the Border Campaign (IRA), Part II of the Offences Against the State Act was re-activated and he ordered the internment without trial of Republican suspects, an action which did much to end the IRA's campaign.\nDe Valera's final term as Taoiseach also saw the passage of numerous reforms in health and welfare. In 1952, unemployment insurance was extended to male agricultural employees, child allowances were extended to the second child, and a maternity allowance for insured women was introduced. A year later, eligibility for maternity and child services and public hospital services was extended to approximately 85% of the population.\nPresident of Ireland.\nWhile Fianna F\u00e1il remained popular among the electorate, 75-year-old de Valera had begun to be seen by the electorate as too old and out of touch to remain as head of government. At the urging of party officials, de Valera decided to retire from government and the D\u00e1il and instead seek the presidency of Ireland. He won the 1959 presidential election on 17 June 1959 and resigned as Taoiseach, Leader of Fianna F\u00e1il and a TD for Clare, six days later, handing over power to Se\u00e1n Lemass.\nDe Valera was inaugurated as President of Ireland on 25 June 1959. By that stage he was \"nearly blind\", according to Down GAA captain Kevin Mussen who met him after the 1960 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship final and considered him \"not a desperately warm sort of man\". De Valera was re-elected President in 1966 aged 84, which until 2013 was a world record for the oldest elected head of state. At his retirement in 1973 at the age of 90, he was the oldest head of state in the world. When he stepped down as president, he ended 55 consecutive years as an elected official.\nAs President of Ireland, de Valera received many state visits, including the 1963 visit of the US president John F. Kennedy. Five months later de Valera attended the state funeral for Kennedy in Washington, D.C., and accompanied a group of 24 Defence Forces cadets who performed a silent drill at his gravesite. In June 1964, he returned to Washington, D.C., as the second President of Ireland to address the United States Congress.\nIn 1966, the Dublin Jewish community arranged the planting and dedication of the \u00c9amon de Valera Forest in Israel, near Nazareth, in recognition of his support for Ireland's Jews.\nIn January 1969, de Valera became the first President of Ireland to address both houses of the Oireachtas, to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the foundation of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.\nIn 1969, seventy-three countries sent goodwill messages to NASA for the historic first lunar landing. These messages still rest on the lunar surface. De Valera's message on behalf of Ireland stated, \"May God grant that the skill and courage which have enabled man to alight upon the Moon will enable him, also, to secure peace and happiness upon the Earth and avoid the danger of self-destruction.\"\nDeath.\n\u00c9amon de Valera died from pneumonia and heart failure in Linden Convalescent Home, Blackrock, Dublin, on 29 August 1975, aged 92. His wife, Sin\u00e9ad de Valera, four years his senior, had died the previous January, on the eve of their 65th wedding anniversary. His body lay in state at Dublin Castle and was given a full state funeral on 3 September at St Mary's Pro-Cathedral, which was broadcast on national television. Over 200,000 people reportedly lined the three-mile funeral route from Dublin city centre to Glasnevin Cemetery. He is buried in Glasnevin alongside his wife and son Brian.\nLegacy.\nDe Valera's political creed evolved from militant republicanism to social and cultural conservatism.\nIreland's dominant political personality for many decades, de Valera received numerous honours. He was elected Chancellor of the National University of Ireland in 1921, holding the post until his death. Pope John XXIII bestowed on him the Order of Christ (KSC). He received honorary degrees from universities in Ireland and abroad. In 1968, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS), a recognition of his lifelong interest in mathematics. He also served as a member of the Parliament of Northern Ireland (for Down from 1921 to 1929 and for South Down from 1933 to 1937), although he held to the republican policy of abstentionism and did not take his seat in Stormont.\nDe Valera was criticised for becoming co-owner of one of Ireland's most influential group of newspapers, Irish Press Newspapers, funded by numerous small investors who received no dividend for decades. De Valera is alleged by critics to have helped keep Ireland under the influence of Catholic conservatism. De Valera rejected, however, demands by organisations like Maria Duce that Roman Catholicism be made the state religion of Ireland, just as he rejected demands by the Irish Christian Front for the Irish Free State to support Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War.\nDe Valera's preoccupation with his part in history, and his need to explain and justify it, are reflected in innumerable ways. His faith in historians as trustworthy guardians of his reputation was not absolute. He made many attempts to influence their views and to adjust and refine the historical record whenever he felt this portrayed him, his allies or his cause inaccurately or unfavourably to his mind, these could often mean the same thing. He extended these endeavours to encompass the larger Irish public. An important function of his newspaper group, the Irish Press group, was to rectify what he saw as the errors and omissions of a decade in which he had been the subject of largely hostile commentary.\nIn recent decades, his role in Irish history has no longer been unequivocally seen by historians as a positive one, and a biography by Tim Pat Coogan alleges that his failures outweigh his achievements, with de Valera's reputation declining while that of his great rival in the 1920s, Michael Collins, was rising. A more recent 2007 work on de Valera by historian Diarmaid Ferriter presents a more positive picture of de Valera's legacy.\nBertie Ahern, at a book launch for Diarmaid Ferriter's biography of de Valera, described de Valera's achievements in political leadership during the formative years of the state:\nOne of de Valera's finest hours was his regrouping of the Republican side after defeat in the civil war, and setting his followers on an exclusively peaceful and democratic path, along which he later had to confront both domestic Fascism and the IRA. He became a democratic statesman, not a dictator. He did not purge the civil service of those who had served his predecessors but made the best use of the talent available.\nA notable failure was his attempt to reverse the provision of the 1937 Constitution in relation to the electoral system. On retiring as Taoiseach in 1959, he proposed that the Proportional Representation system enshrined in that constitution should be replaced. De Valera argued that Proportional Representation had been responsible for the instability that had characterised much of the post-war period. A constitutional referendum to ratify this was defeated by the people.\nOne aspect of de Valera's legacy is that since the foundation of the state, a de Valera has nearly always served in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann. \u00c9amon de Valera served until 1959, and his son, Vivion de Valera, was a Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) from 1945 to 1981. \u00c9amon \u00d3 Cu\u00edv, his grandson, served as a member of the D\u00e1il from 1992 to 2024 (previously having served in the Seanad from 1989 to 1992) with one stint as deputy leader of Fianna F\u00e1il, while his granddaughter, S\u00edle de Valera, is also former TD, with both having served in ministries in the Irish Government.\nCatholic social policy.\nIn 1931, de Valera said in the D\u00e1il: \"I believe that every citizen in this country is entitled to his share of public appointments, and that there should not be discrimination on the ground of religion, discrimination, mind you, in the sense that because a person was of a particular religion, religion should not be made an excuse for denying a person an appointment for which he or she was fully qualified. Then there comes the question, what are qualifications? If I thought that the principle that the librarian in a Catholic community should be Catholic was a new principle, introduced merely to deny a Protestant an appointment, I would vote against it, but I know from my youth that it is not so. ... if I had a vote on a local body, and if there were two qualified people who had to deal with a Catholic community, and if one was a Catholic and the other a Protestant, I would unhesitatingly vote for the Catholic. Let us be clear and let us know where we are.\" Ryle Dwyer, writing in 2008, said \"If those were his honest views, one could also say without hesitation that the Long Fellow was a bigot. But, in fact, he was just playing the role of a political hypocrite. It was cynical, but it should be stressed that he behaved responsibly in this regard when he came to power.\"\nDe Valera led Fianna F\u00e1il to adopt conservative social policies since he believed devoutly that the Catholic church and the family were central to Irish identity. He added clauses to the new Constitution of Ireland (1937) to \"guard with special care the institution of marriage\" and prohibit divorce. His constitution also recognised \"the special position\" of the Catholic Church and recognised other denominations including the Church of Ireland and Jewish congregations, while guaranteeing the religious freedom of all citizens; however, he resisted an attempt to make Roman Catholicism the state religion and his constitution forbids the establishment of a state religion. His policies were welcomed by a largely devout, conservative and rural electorate. The unenforceable articles in the constitution which reinforced the traditional view that a woman's place was in the home further illustrate the direction in which Ireland was moving. An act of 1935 prohibited the importation or sale of contraceptives. The most rigorous censorship laws in Western Europe complete the picture.\nThe specific recognition of Roman Catholicism was deleted by the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland (1973) and the prohibition of divorce was removed by the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland (1996). Although the Irish Supreme Court declared in 1973 that the 1935 contraception legislation was not repugnant to the Constitution and therefore remained valid, subsequent laws have liberalised the use of contraception (see Contraception in the Republic of Ireland).\nIn popular culture.\nDe Valera's portrait illustrated the front cover of the 25 March 1940 issue of \"Time\" magazine accompanying the article \"Eire: Prime Minister of Freedom\".\nHe has been portrayed by:\nGovernments.\nThe following governments were led by de Valera:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It lies in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas and marks part of the China\u2013Nepal border at its summit. Its height was most recently measured in 2020 by Chinese and Nepali authorities as .\nMount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the standard route) and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall. As of May 2024, 340 people have died on Everest. Over 200 bodies remain on the mountain and have not been removed due to the dangerous conditions.\nClimbers typically ascend only part of Mount Everest's elevation, as the mountain's full elevation is measured from the geoid, which approximates sea level. The closest sea to Mount Everest's summit is the Bay of Bengal, almost away. To approximate a climb of the entire height of Mount Everest, one would need to start from this coastline, a feat accomplished by Tim Macartney-Snape's team in 1990. Climbers usually begin their ascent from base camps above . The amount of elevation climbed from below these camps varies. On the Tibetan side, most climbers drive directly to the North Base Camp. On the Nepalese side, climbers generally fly into Kathmandu, then Lukla, and trek to the South Base Camp, making the climb from Lukla to the summit about in elevation gain.\nThe first recorded efforts to reach Everest's summit were made by British mountaineers. As Nepal did not allow foreigners to enter the country at the time, the British made several attempts on the North Ridge route from the Tibetan side. After the first reconnaissance expedition by the British in 1921 reached on the North Col, the 1922 expedition on its first summit attempt marked the first time a human had climbed above and it also pushed the North Ridge route up to . On the 1924 expedition George Mallory and Andrew Irvine made a final summit attempt on 8 June but never returned, sparking debate as to whether they were the first to reach the top. Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary made the first documented ascent of Everest in 1953, using the Southeast Ridge route. Norgay had reached the previous year as a member of the 1952 Swiss expedition. The Chinese mountaineering team of Wang Fuzhou, Gonpo, and Qu Yinhua made the first reported ascent of the peak from the North Ridge on 25 May 1960.\nName.\nMount Everest's Nepali/Sanskrit name is \"Sagarm\u0101th\u0101\" (IAST transcription) or \"Sagar-Matha\" (\u0938\u0917\u0930-\u092e\u093e\u0925\u093e, , \"goddess of the sky\"), which means \"the head in the great blue sky\", being derived from \u0938\u0917\u0930 (sagar), meaning \"sky\", and \u092e\u093e\u0925\u093e (m\u0101th\u0101), meaning \"head\".\nThe Tibetan name for Everest is \"Qomolangma\" (, \u00a0\"holy mother\"). The name was first recorded (in a Chinese transcription) in the 1721 Kangxi Atlas, issued during the reign of Qing Emperor Kangxi; it first appeared in the West in 1733 as \"Tchoumour Lancma\", on a map prepared by the French geographer D'Anville and based on Kangxi Atlas. The Tibetan name is also popularly romanised as \"Chomolungma\" and (in Wylie) as \"Jo-mo-glang-ma\".\nThe official Chinese transcription is (\u00a0), or \"Zh\u016bm\u00f9l\u01cengm\u01ce F\u0113ng\" in pinyin. While other Chinese names have been used historically, including \"Sh\u00e8ngm\u01d4 F\u0113ng\" (\u00a0, \u00a0, \u00a0\"holy mother peak\"), these names were largely phased out after the Chinese Ministry of Internal Affairs issued a decree to adopt a sole name in May 1952. \nThe British geographic survey of 1849 attempted to preserve local names when possible (e.g., Kangchenjunga and Dhaulagiri). However, Andrew Waugh, the British Surveyor General of India, claimed that he could not find a commonly used local name, and that his search for one had been hampered by the Nepalese and Tibetan policy of exclusion of foreigners. Waugh argued that \u2013 because there were many local names \u2013 it would be difficult to favour one name over all others; he therefore decided that Peak XV should be named after British surveyor Sir George Everest, his predecessor as Surveyor General of India. Everest himself opposed the honour, and told the Royal Geographical Society in 1857 that \"Everest\" could neither be written in Hindi nor pronounced by \"the native of India\". Despite Everest's objections, Waugh's proposed name prevailed, and the Royal Geographical Society officially adopted the name \"Mount Everest\" in 1865. The modern pronunciation of Everest () is different from Sir George's pronunciation of his surname ( ).\nIn the late 19th century, many European cartographers incorrectly believed that a native name for the mountain was Gaurishankar, a mountain between Kathmandu and Everest.\nSurveys.\n19th century.\nIn 1802, the British began the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India to fix, among other things, the locations, heights, and names of the world's highest mountains. Starting in southern India, the survey teams moved northward using giant theodolites, each weighing and requiring 12 men to carry, to measure heights as accurately as possible. They reached the Himalayan foothills by the 1830s, but Nepal was unwilling to allow the British to enter the country due to suspicions of their intentions. Several requests by the surveyors to enter Nepal were denied.\nThe British were forced to continue their observations from Terai, a region south of Nepal which is parallel to the Himalayas. Conditions in Terai were difficult because of torrential rains and malaria. Three survey officers died from malaria while two others had to retire because of failing health.\nNonetheless, in 1847, the British continued the survey and began detailed observations of the Himalayan peaks from observation stations up to distant. Weather restricted work to the last three months of the year. In November 1847, Andrew Scott Waugh, the British Surveyor General of India, made several observations from the Sawajpore station at the east end of the Himalayas. Kangchenjunga was then considered the highest peak in the world, and with interest, he noted a peak beyond it, about away. John Armstrong, one of Waugh's subordinates, also saw the peak from a site farther west and called it peak \"b\". Waugh would later write that the observations indicated that peak \"b\" was higher than Kangchenjunga, but closer observations were required for verification. The following year, Waugh sent a survey official back to Terai to make closer observations of peak \"b\", but clouds thwarted his attempts.\nIn 1849, Waugh dispatched James Nicolson to the area, who made two observations from Jirol, away. Nicolson then took the largest theodolite and headed east, obtaining over 30 observations from five different locations, with the closest being from the peak.\nNicolson retreated to Patna on the Ganges to perform the necessary calculations based on his observations. His raw data gave an average height of for peak \"b\", but this did not consider light refraction, which distorts heights. However, the number clearly indicated that peak \"b\" was higher than Kangchenjunga. Nicolson contracted malaria and was forced to return home without finishing his calculations. Michael Hennessy, one of Waugh's assistants, had begun designating peaks based on Roman numerals, with Kangchenjunga named Peak\u00a0IX. Peak \"b\" now became known as Peak\u00a0XV.\nIn 1852, stationed at the survey headquarters in Dehradun, Radhanath Sikdar, an Indian mathematician and surveyor from Bengal was the first to identify Everest as the world's highest peak, using trigonometric calculations based on Nicolson's measurements. An official announcement that Peak\u00a0XV was the highest was delayed for several years as the calculations were repeatedly verified. Waugh began work on Nicolson's data in 1854, and along with his staff spent almost two years working on the numbers, having to deal with the problems of light refraction, barometric pressure, and temperature over the vast distances of the observations. Finally, in March 1856 he announced his findings in a letter to his deputy in Calcutta. Kangchenjunga was declared to be , while Peak\u00a0XV was given the height of . Waugh concluded that Peak\u00a0XV was \"most probably the highest in the world\". Peak\u00a0XV (measured in feet) was calculated to be exactly high, but was publicly declared to be in order to avoid the impression that an exact height of 29000\u00a0ft was nothing more than a rounded estimate. Waugh is sometimes playfully credited with being \"the first person to put two feet on top of Mount Everest\".\n20th century.\nIn 1856, Andrew Waugh announced Everest (then known as Peak XV) as high, after several years of calculations based on observations made by the Great Trigonometrical Survey. \nFrom 1952 to 1954, the Survey of India, using triangulation methods, determined that the height of Everest was . In 1975 it was subsequently reaffirmed by a Chinese measurement of . In both cases the snow cap, not the rock head, was measured.\nThe height given was officially recognised by Nepal and China. Nepal planned a new survey in 2019 to determine if the April 2015 Nepal earthquake affected the height of the mountain.\nIn May 1999, an American Everest expedition directed by Bradford Washburn anchored a GPS unit into the highest bedrock. A rock head elevation of , and a snow/ice elevation higher, were obtained via this device. Although as of 2001, it has not been officially recognised by Nepal, this figure is widely quoted. Geoid uncertainty casts doubt upon the accuracy claimed by both the 1999 and 2005 (see \u00a7 21st-century surveys) surveys.\nIn 1955, a detailed photogrammetric map (at a scale of 1:50,000) of the Khumbu region, including the south side of Mount Everest, was made by Erwin Schneider as part of the 1955 International Himalayan Expedition, which also attempted Lhotse.\nIn the late 1980s, an even more detailed topographic map of the Everest area was made under the direction of Bradford Washburn, using extensive aerial photography.\n21st century.\nOn 9 October 2005, after several months of measurement and calculation, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping announced the height of Everest as with accuracy of \u00b1, claiming it was the most accurate and precise measurement to date. This height is based on the highest point of rock and not the snow and ice covering it. The Chinese team measured a snow-ice depth of , which is in agreement with a net elevation of . An argument arose between China and Nepal as to whether the official height should be the rock height (8,844 m, China) or the snow height (8,848 m, Nepal). In 2010, both sides agreed that the height of Everest is 8,848 m, and Nepal recognises China's claim that the rock height of Everest is 8,844 m. On 8 December 2020, it was jointly announced by the two countries that the new official height is .\nIt is thought that the plate tectonics of the Main Himalayan Thrust and related faults, which form the convergent boundary between the Eurasian Plate and Indian Plate, are adding to the height and moving the summit northeastwards. Two accounts suggest the rates of change are per year vertically and per year horizontally, but another account mentions more lateral movement (), and even shrinkage has been suggested.\nComparisons.\nThe summit of Everest is the point at which Earth's surface reaches the greatest distance above sea level. Several other mountains are sometimes claimed to be the \"tallest mountains on Earth\". Mauna Kea in Hawaii is tallest when measured from its base; it rises over from its base on the mid-ocean floor, but only attains above sea level.\nBy the same measure of base to summit, Denali (also called Mount McKinley) in Alaska is taller than Everest as well. Despite its height above sea level of only , Denali sits atop a sloping plain with elevations from , yielding a height above base in the range of ; a commonly quoted figure is . By comparison, reasonable base elevations for Everest range from on the south side to on the Tibetan Plateau, yielding a height above base in the range of .\nThe summit of Chimborazo in Ecuador is farther from Earth's centre () than that of Everest (), because the Earth bulges at the equator. This is despite Chimborazo having a peak of above sea level versus Mount Everest's .\nContext and maps.\nMany of the highest mountains in the world are near Mount Everest, for example Lhotse, ; Nuptse, , Changtse, and Khumbutse, . On the southwest side, a major feature in the lower areas is the Khumbu icefall and glacier, an obstacle to climbers on those routes but also to the base camps.\npx;\"&gt;Southern and northern climbing routes as seen from the International Space Station (The names on the photo are links to corresponding pages.)\nGeology.\nGeologists have subdivided the rocks comprising Mount Everest into three units called formations. Each formation is separated from the other by low-angle faults, called detachments, along which they have been thrust southward over each other. From the summit of Mount Everest to its base these rock units are the Qomolangma Formation, the North Col Formation, and the Rongbuk Formation.\nThe Qomolangma Formation, also known as the Jolmo Lungama Formation, runs from the summit to the top of the Yellow Band, about above sea level. It consists of greyish to dark grey or white, parallel laminated and bedded, Ordovician limestone interlayered with subordinate beds of recrystallised dolomite with argillaceous laminae and siltstone. Gansser first reported finding microscopic fragments of crinoids in this limestone. Later petrographic analysis of samples of the limestone from near the summit revealed them to be composed of carbonate pellets and finely fragmented remains of trilobites, crinoids, and ostracods. Other samples were so badly sheared and recrystallised that their original constituents could not be determined. A thick, white-weathering thrombolite bed that is thick comprises the foot of the \"Third Step\", and base of the summit pyramid of Everest. This bed, which crops out starting about below the summit of Mount Everest, consists of sediments trapped, bound, and cemented by the biofilms of micro-organisms, especially cyanobacteria, in shallow marine waters. The Qomolangma Formation is broken up by several high-angle faults that terminate at the low angle normal fault, the Qomolangma Detachment. This detachment separates it from the underlying Yellow Band. The lower five metres of the Qomolangma Formation overlying this detachment are very highly deformed.\nThe bulk of Mount Everest, between , consists of the North Col Formation, of which the Yellow Band forms the upper part between . The Yellow Band consists of intercalated beds of Middle Cambrian diopside-epidote-bearing marble, which weathers a distinctive yellowish brown, and muscovite-biotite phyllite and semischist. Petrographic analysis of marble collected from about found it to consist as much as five per cent of the ghosts of recrystallised crinoid ossicles. The upper five metres of the Yellow Band lying adjacent to the Qomolangma Detachment is badly deformed. A thick fault breccia separates it from the overlying Qomolangma Formation.\nThe remainder of the North Col Formation, exposed between on Mount Everest, consists of interlayered and deformed schist, phyllite, and minor marble. Between , the North Col Formation consists chiefly of biotite-quartz phyllite and chlorite-biotite phyllite intercalated with minor amounts of biotite-sericite-quartz schist. Between , the lower part of the North Col Formation consists of biotite-quartz schist intercalated with epidote-quartz schist, biotite-calcite-quartz schist, and thin layers of quartzose marble. These metamorphic rocks appear to be the result of the metamorphism of Middle to Early Cambrian deep sea flysch composed of interbedded, mudstone, shale, clayey sandstone, calcareous sandstone, graywacke, and sandy limestone. The base of the North Col Formation is a regional low-angle normal fault called the \"Lhotse detachment\".\nBelow 7,000\u00a0m (23,000\u00a0ft), the Rongbuk Formation underlies the North Col Formation and forms the base of Mount Everest. It consists of sillimanite-K-feldspar grade schist and gneiss intruded by numerous sills and dikes of leucogranite ranging in thickness from 1\u00a0cm to 1,500\u00a0m (0.4\u00a0in to 4,900\u00a0ft). These leucogranites are part of a belt of Late Oligocene\u2013Miocene intrusive rocks known as the Higher Himalayan leucogranite. They formed as the result of partial melting of Paleoproterozoic to Ordovician high-grade metasedimentary rocks of the Higher Himalayan Sequence about 20 to 24\u00a0million years ago during the subduction of the Indian Plate.\nMount Everest consists of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks that have been faulted southward over continental crust composed of Archean granulites of the Indian Plate during the Cenozoic collision of India with Asia. Current interpretations argue that the Qomolangma and North Col formations consist of marine sediments that accumulated within the continental shelf of the northern passive continental margin of India before it collided with Asia. The Cenozoic collision of India with Asia subsequently deformed and metamorphosed these strata as it thrust them southward and upward. The Rongbuk Formation consists of a sequence of high-grade metamorphic and granitic rocks that were derived from the alteration of high-grade metasedimentary rocks. During the collision of India with Asia, these rocks were thrust downward and to the north as they were overridden by other strata; heated, metamorphosed, and partially melted at depths of over below sea level; and then forced upward to surface by thrusting towards the south between two major detachments. Mount Everest is rising by about 2\u00a0mm per year.\nIUGS geological heritage site.\nIn respect of the recognition of the \"highest rocks on the planet\" as fossiliferous, marine limestone, the Ordovician Rocks of Mount Everest were included by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) in its assemblage of 100 geological heritage sites around the world in a listing published in October 2022. The organisation defines an IUGS Geological Heritage Site as \"a key place with geological elements and/or processes of international scientific relevance, used as a reference, and/or with a substantial contribution to the development of geological sciences through history.\"\nFlora and fauna.\nThere is very little native flora or fauna on Everest. A type of moss grows at on Mount Everest and it may be the highest altitude plant species. An alpine cushion plant called \"Arenaria\" is known to grow below in the region. According to the study based on satellite data from 1993 to 2018, vegetation is expanding in the Everest region. Researchers have found plants in areas that were previously deemed bare.\nA minute black jumping spider of the genus \"Euophrys\" has been found at elevations as high as , possibly making it the highest confirmed non-microscopic permanent resident on Earth. Another Euophrys species, \"E. everestensis\", has been found at , and may feed on insects that have been blown there by the wind. There is a high likelihood of microscopic life at even higher altitudes.\nThe bar-headed goose migrates over the Himalayas and have been seen flying at the higher altitudes of the mountain. In 1953, George Lowe (part of the expedition of Tenzing and Hillary) said that he saw bar-headed geese flying over Everest's summit. Another bird species, the chough, have been spotted as high as the South Col at and yellow-billed choughs have been seen as high as .\nYaks are often used to haul gear for Mount Everest climbs. They can haul around 100\u00a0kg (220 pounds), have thick fur and large lungs. Other animals in the region include the Himalayan tahr, which is sometimes the prey of the snow leopard. The Himalayan black bear can be found up to about and the red panda is also present in the region. One expedition found a surprising range of species in the region including a pika and ten new species of ants.\nConservation.\nFrom the Nepalese side, Everest is protected as part of Sagarmatha National Park, while from the Chinese side the mountain is protected as part of Qomolangma National Nature Reserve.\nClimate.\nMount Everest has an ice cap climate (K\u00f6ppen \"EF\") with all months averaging well below freezing.\nClimate change.\nThe base camp for Everest expeditions based out of Nepal is located by Khumbu Glacier, which is rapidly thinning and destabilizing due to climate change, making it unsafe for climbers. As recommended by the committee formed by Nepal's government to facilitate and monitor mountaineering in the Everest region, Taranath Adhikari\u2014the director general of Nepal's tourism department\u2014said they have plans to move the base camp to a lower altitude. This would mean a longer distance for climbers between the base camp and Camp 1. Although officials had initially stated that the move might happen by 2024, resistance from the climbing and Sherpa communities resulted in the move being put on hold, in part because there is no viable alternative camp location that would allow climbers to pass through the icefall in the safer early morning hours.\nMeteorology.\nIn 2008, a new weather station at about elevation went online. The project was orchestrated by Stations at High Altitude for Research on the Environment (SHARE), which also placed the Mount Everest webcam in 2011. The solar-powered weather station is on the South Col.\nMount Everest extends into the upper troposphere and penetrates the stratosphere. The air pressure at the summit is generally about one-third what it is at sea level. The altitude can expose the summit to the fast and freezing winds of the jet stream. Winds commonly attain ; in February 2004, a wind speed of was recorded at the summit.\nThese winds can hamper or endanger climbers, by blowing them into chasms or (by Bernoulli's principle) by lowering the air pressure further, reducing available oxygen by up to 14 percent. To avoid the harshest winds, climbers typically aim for a 7- to 10-day window in the spring and fall when the Asian monsoon season is starting up or ending.\nMount Everest hosts several weather stations that collect important data on high-altitude weather conditions. Among them is the Balcony Station, the highest weather station on the planet, located at about above sea level. Set up by climate scientists Tom Matthews and Baker Perry in 2019, this station is positioned just below the summit of Everest, which is the highest point on Earth.\nAs of January 20, 2020, the Balcony Station ceased transmitting data.\nExpeditions.\nBecause Everest is the highest mountain in the world, it has attracted considerable attention and climbing attempts. Whether the mountain was climbed in ancient times is unknown. It may have been climbed in 1924, although this has never been confirmed, as neither man making the attempt returned. Climbing routes have been established over decades of expeditions.\nThe summit is first known to have been reached by humans in 1953. Despite the effort poured into expeditions, only about 200 people had summited by 1987. Everest remained a difficult climb for decades, even by professional climbers and large national expeditions, which were the norm until the commercial era began in the 1990s. As of December 2024[ [update]], The Himalayan Database recorded just under 13,000 total summits, by around 7,200 different people.\nAlthough lower mountains have longer or steeper climbs, Everest is so high the jet stream can hit it. Climbers can be faced with winds beyond when the weather shifts. At certain times of the year the jet stream shifts north, providing periods of relative calm at the mountain. Other dangers include blizzards and avalanches.\nEarly attempts.\nIn 1885, Clinton Thomas Dent, president of the Alpine Club, suggested climbing Everest was possible in his book \"Above the Snow Line\". The northern approach to the mountain was discovered by George Mallory and Guy Bullock on the initial 1921 British Reconnaissance Expedition. It was not equipped for a serious attempt to climb the mountain. With Mallory leading, and thus becoming the first European to set foot on Everest's flanks, they climbed the North Col to an altitude of . From there, Mallory espied a route to the top, but the party was unprepared to climb further and descended. The British returned for a 1922 expedition. On the first summit attempt Mallory, Col. Felix Norton, and Howard Somervell without supplemental oxygen reached , the first time a human reported to climb higher than . George Finch together with Geoffrey Bruce climbed using oxygen for the first time. They ascended at a remarkable speed\u2014 per hour\u2014and reached an altitude of .\nThe next expedition was in 1924. The initial attempt by Mallory and Geoffrey Bruce was aborted when weather conditions prevented the establishment of Camp\u00a0VI. The next attempt was by Norton and Somervell, who climbed without oxygen and in perfect weather, traversing the North Face into the Great Couloir. Norton managed to reach, though he ascended only or so in the last hour. Mallory used oxygen equipment for a last-ditch effort. He chose young Andrew Irvine as his partner. On 8 June 1924, George Mallory and Andrew Irvine made an attempt on the summit via the North Col-North Ridge-Northeast Ridge route from which they never returned. On 1 May 1999, the Mallory and Irvine Research Expedition found Mallory's body on the North Face in a snow basin below and to the west of the traditional site of Camp\u00a0VI. Controversy has raged in the mountaineering community whether one or both reached the summit 29\u00a0years before the first confirmed ascent and safe descent in 1953. Irvine's detached foot, still in a boot and sock, was found in 2024.\nIn 1933, Lady Houston, a British millionaire, funded the Houston Everest Flight of 1933, which saw a formation of two aeroplanes led by the Marquess of Clydesdale fly over the Everest summit.\nEarly expeditions\u2014such as Charles Bruce's in the 1920s and Hugh Ruttledge's two unsuccessful attempts in 1933 and 1936\u2014tried to ascend the mountain from Tibet, via the North Face. Access was closed from the north to Western expeditions in 1950 after China took control of Tibet. In 1950, Bill Tilman and a small party which included Charles Houston, Oscar Houston, and Betsy Cowles undertook an exploratory expedition to Everest through Nepal along the route which has become the standard approach to Everest from the south.\nThe 1952 Swiss Mount Everest expedition was granted permission to attempt a climb from Nepal. It established a route through the Khumbu icefall and ascended to the South Col at an elevation of . Raymond Lambert and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay were able to reach an elevation of about on the Southeast Ridge, setting a new climbing altitude record. Tenzing's experience was useful when he was hired to be part of the British expedition in 1953. The Swiss made another post-monsoon attempt in the autumn; they made it to the South Col but were driven back by winter winds and severe cold.\nFirst successful ascent by Tenzing and Hillary, 1953.\nIn 1953, a ninth British expedition, led by John Hunt, returned to Nepal. Hunt selected two climbing pairs to attempt the summit. The first, Tom Bourdillon and Charles Evans, came within of the summit on 26 May 1953, but turned back after running into oxygen problems. As planned, their work in routefinding, breaking trail and oxygen caches were of great aid to the following pair. Two days later, the expedition made its second assault with the second pair: New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, a Nepali Sherpa climber. They reached the summit at 11:30am local time on 29 May 1953 via the South Col route. At the time, both acknowledged it as a team effort by the whole expedition, but Tenzing revealed a few years later that Hillary had put his foot on the summit first. They took photos and buried sweets and a small cross in the snow before descending.\n1950s\u201360s.\nOn 23 May 1956, Ernst Schmied and Juerg Marmet ascended. Wang Fuzhou, Gonpo and Qu Yinhua of China made the first reported ascent of the peak from the North Ridge in May 1960. The first American to climb Everest, Jim Whittaker, joined by Nawang Gombu, reached the summit on 1 May 1963 on the American Mount Everest expedition and on 22 May on the same expedition Tom Hornbein and Willi Unsoeld were the first the traverse the mountain by climbing via the North Face and descending via the South Col.\n1970s.\nIn 1970, Japanese mountaineers conducted a major expedition. The centrepiece was a large \"siege\"-style expedition, working on finding a new route up the Southwest Face. Another element was an attempt to ski Everest. Despite a staff of over one hundred and a decade of planning, the expedition suffered eight deaths and failed to summit. However, Japanese expeditions enjoyed some successes. Yuichiro Miura became the first man to ski down Everest from the South Col\u2014he descended nearly from the South Col before falling with extreme injuries. Another success was an expedition that put four on the summit via the South Col route. Miura's exploits became the subject of film, and he went on to become the oldest person to summit Everest in 2003 aged 70 and in 2013 aged 80.\nIn 1975, Junko Tabei became the first woman to summit Everest. The 1975 British Mount Everest Southwest Face expedition led and organised by Chris Bonington made the first ascent of the Southwest Face from the Western Cwm. In 1978, Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler made the first ascent of Everest without supplemental oxygen.\n1979/1980: Winter Himalaism.\nThe Polish climber Andrzej Zawada headed the first winter ascent of Everest, the first winter ascent of an eight-thousander. On 15 January, the team managed to set up Camp III at above sea level, but further action was stopped by hurricane-force winds. The weather improved after 11 February, when Leszek Cichy, Walenty Fiut and Krzysztof Wielicki set up camp IV on South Col at . Cichy and Wielicki started the final ascent at 6:50am on 17 February. At 2:40pm Andrzej Zawada at base camp heard the climbers' voices over the radio \u2013 \"We are on the summit! The strong wind blows all the time. It is unimaginably cold.\" The successful winter ascent started a new decade of Winter Himalaism, which became a Polish specialisation. After 1980 Poles did ten first winter ascents on 8000 metre peaks.\nLho La tragedy, 1989.\nIn 1989, Polish climbers under the leadership of Eugeniusz Chrobak organised an international expedition to Everest on a difficult western ridge. Ten Poles and nine foreigners participated, but only the Poles remained in the attempt for the summit. On 24 May, Chrobak and Andrzej Marciniak, starting from camp V at , overcame the ridge and reached the summit. But on 27 May, during an avalanche from the side of Khumbutse near the Lho La pass, four climbers were killed: Miros\u0142aw D\u0105sal, Miros\u0142aw Gardzielewski, Zygmunt Andrzej Heinrich and Wac\u0142aw Otr\u0119ba. The following day, due to his injuries, Chrobak died. Marciniak, who was injured, was saved by a rescue expedition in which Artur Hajzer and New Zealanders Gary Ball and Rob Hall took part. The organisation of the rescue included Reinhold Messner, Elizabeth Hawley, Carlos Carsolio and the US consul.\n1996 disaster.\nOn 10 and 11 May 1996, eight climbers died after guided expeditions were caught in a blizzard during a summit attempt on 10 May. During the 1996 season, 15 people died. These were the highest death tolls for a single weather event, and season, until the 16 deaths in the 2014 Mount Everest ice avalanche. The guiding disaster gained publicity and raised questions about the commercialisation of climbing and the safety of guiding clients on Everest.\nJournalist Jon Krakauer, on assignment from \"Outside\" magazine, was in one of the affected guided parties, and published the bestseller \"Into Thin Air\", which related his experience. Krakauer was critical of guide Anatoli Boukreev. A year later, Boukreev co-authored \"The Climb\", in part as a rebuttal of Krakauer's portrayal. The dispute sparked debate within the climbing community. Boukreev was awarded The American Alpine Club's David Sowles Award for his rescue efforts on the expedition. In 2004 researchers from the University of Toronto told the \"New Scientist\" that analysis of conditions on 11 May suggested that weather caused oxygen levels to plunge about 14 per cent.\nOne survivor was Beck Weathers, left for dead about 275 metres (900 feet) from Camp 4 at 7,950 metres (26,085 feet). After spending a night on the mountain, Weathers made it back to Camp 4 with massive frostbite and vision impaired due to snow blindness. Fellow climbers considered his condition terminal and left him in a tent to die overnight. Weathers was lowered to Camp 2 and a helicopter rescue was organised by the Nepali Army. The storm's impact on climbers on the North Ridge, where several climbers also died, was detailed in a first-hand account by Matt Dickinson in his book \"The Other Side of Everest\". Sixteen-year-old Mark Pfetzer was on the climb and wrote about it in, \"Within Reach: My Everest Story\". The 2015 feature film \"Everest\" is based on the events of this guiding disaster.\n2006.\nIn 2006, 12 people died. David Sharp's death triggered debate and years of discussion about climbing ethics. The question was whether climbers had left a man to die and whether he could have been saved. He attempted to summit alone with two bottles of oxygen, compared to the standard five used by most climbers. He arranged his permit through Asian Trekking, a Kathmandu-based company that provided basic services to base camp, but not beyond that point. Sharp climbed without a radio or guide. Multiple climbing parties encountered Sharp in distress.\nDouble-amputee climber Mark Inglis said that on 15 May his climbing party, and many others, had passed Sharp, sheltering under a rock overhang below the summit, without attempting a rescue. Inglis said 40 people had passed by Sharp, but he might have been overlooked as climbers assumed Sharp was the corpse nicknamed \"Green Boots\", but Inglis was not aware that climbers had tried to help Sharp despite being in the process of helping an injured woman, Bur\u00e7ak \u00d6zo\u011flu Po\u00e7an, down. There has been discussion about Himex in the commentary on Inglis and Sharp. In regard to Inglis's initial comments, he later revised details because he had been interviewed while he was \"physically and mentally exhausted, and in much pain. He had suffered frostbite \u2013 he later had five fingertips amputated.\" It was estimated that Sharp summited on 14 May and began his descent, but on 15 May he was in trouble and being passed by climbers on their way up and down. It is believed he was suffering from hypoxia and was about from the summit on the North Side route.\n\"The Tribune\", India, quoted someone who described what happened to Sharp as \"the most shameful act in the history of mountaineering\". Much of this controversy was captured by the \"Discovery Channel\" while filming \"\". A crucial decision affecting Sharp is shown where a returning climber, adventurer Maxim Chaya, is descending and radios his base camp manager (Russell Brice) that he has found a frostbitten and unconscious climber in distress. Chaya is unable to identify Sharp, who had chosen to climb solo and did not identify himself to other climbers. The manager assumes Sharp is part of a group that has already calculated they must abandon him, and informs his lone climber there is no chance of him being able to help Sharp by himself. As Sharp's condition deteriorates and other descending climbers pass him, his opportunities for rescue diminish: his legs and feet curl from frostbite, preventing him walking; later descending climbers are lower on oxygen and lack the strength to offer aid; time runs out for Sherpas to return and rescue him. Sharp's body remained just below the summit on the Chinese side next to \"Green Boots\"; they shared a space in a rock cave that was an ad hoc tomb. Sharp's body was removed from the cave in 2007, and since 2014, Green Boots has been missing, presumably removed or buried.\nAs the Sharp debate started, on 26 May Australian climber Lincoln Hall was found alive after being left. He was found by a party of four climbers who, giving up their own attempt, stayed with Hall and descended with him and 11 Sherpas sent up to carry him down. Hall fully recovered. His team had assumed he had died from cerebral edema, and were instructed to cover him with rocks. There were no rocks to do this and he was abandoned. The erroneous information of his death was passed to his family.\n2007.\nOn 21 May 2007, Canadian climber Meagan McGrath initiated the successful high-altitude rescue of Nepali Usha Bista. McGrath was selected as a 2011 recipient of the Sir Edmund Hillary Foundation of Canada Humanitarian Award, which recognises a Canadian who has contributed a significant service in the Himalayan Region of Nepal.\nAscent statistics up to 2010 season.\nBy the end of 2010, there had been 5,104 summits by about 3,142 individuals, with 77 per cent accomplished since 2000. The summit was achieved in 7 of the 22 years from 1953 to 1974 and not missed between 1975 and 2014. An illustration of the explosion of popularity is provided by the number of daily ascents. Analysis of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster shows part of the blame was on the bottleneck caused by a large number of climbers (33 to 36) attempting to summit on the same day; this was unusually high at the time. By comparison, on 23 May 2010, the summit was reached by 169 climbers \u2013 more summits in a single day than in the 31 years from the first successful summit in 1953 to 1983. Nearly all attempts at the summit are done using one of two main routes. In 2005\u201307, more than half elected to use the more challenging, but cheaper northeast route. In 2008, the northeast route was closed by the Chinese government for the season, and the only people able to summit from the north that year were athletes carrying the Olympic torch for the 2008 Summer Olympics. The route was closed to foreigners in 2009 in the run-up to the 50th anniversary of the Dalai Lama's exile. These closures led to declining interest in the north route, and in 2010, two-thirds summitted from the south.\n2010s.\nThe 2010s were a time of new highs and lows for the mountain, with disasters in 2013 and 2014 causing record deaths. In 2015 there were no summits for the first time in decades. A record was set in 2019 with over 890 summiters.\n2014 avalanche.\nOn 18 April 2014, an avalanche hit the area just below Base Camp 2. 16 people were killed, all Nepali guides, and nine injured. In response, Sherpa climbing guides walked off the job and most climbing companies pulled out in respect for the Sherpa people mourning their loss.\n2015 avalanche and earthquake.\n2015 was set to be a record-breaking season of climbs, with hundreds of permits. However, on 25 April 2015, an earthquake measuring 7.8 Mw triggered an avalanche that hit Everest Base Camp, shutting down the season. 18 bodies were recovered by the Indian Army mountaineering team. The avalanche began on Pumori, moved through the Khumbu Icefall on the southwest side of Everest, and slammed into the South Base Camp. 2015 was the first time since 1974 with no spring summits, as all climbing teams pulled out. One reason for this was the high probability of aftershocks. Just weeks after the first quake, the region experienced a 7.3 quake and there were many aftershocks.\nThe quakes trapped hundreds of climbers above the Khumbu icefall, and they had to be evacuated by helicopter as they ran low on supplies. The quake shifted the route through the ice fall, making it impassable. Bad weather made helicopter evacuation difficult. There was a large impact overall on Nepal, with 9,000 dead. In Tibet, by 28 April at least 25 had died.\n2016 and 2017.\nHawley's database records 641 made it to the summit in early 2016. 2017 was the biggest season yet, yielding hundreds of summiters and a handful of deaths. On 27 May, Kami Rita made his 21st summit with the Alpine Ascents Everest Expedition, one of three people, along with Apa Sherpa and Phurba Tashi Sherpa to make it to the summit 21 times. The season had a tragic start with the death of Ueli Steck, who died from a fall during a warm-up climb. There was continued discussion about possible changes to the Hillary Step. Summiters for 2017 was tallied up to be 648.\n2018.\nA record 891 summited in 2018. One factor that aided this was an especially long and clear weather window of 11 days during the critical spring climbing season. Various records were broken, including a summit by double-amputee Xia Boyu, after winning a case in the Nepali Supreme Court. 7 climbers died. Although record numbers summitted, old-time summiteers that made expeditions in the 1980s lamented the crowding, feces, and cost.\n2019.\nThe spring or pre-monsoon window for 2019 witnessed the deaths of climbers. Images of hundreds queuing to reach the summit and reports of climbers stepping over dead bodies dismayed people around the world.\nThere was an announcement of an expedition to re-measure the height of Everest, particularly in light of the 2015 earthquakes. Among the climbing teams was a scientific expedition with a planned study of pollution, and how things like snow and vegetation influence the availability of food and water in the region. In the 2019 spring season, there were roughly 40 teams with almost 400 climbers and several hundred guides attempting to summit on the Nepali side. Nepal issued 381 climbing permits for 2019. For the northern routes in Chinese Tibet, several hundred more permits were issued. In May, Nepali mountaineering guide Kami Rita summited twice within a week, his 23rd and 24th ascents.\nBy 28 May, the death toll reached 11, when a climber died at about during the descent, and a 12th climber was missing and later declared dead. The deaths were possibly due to crowding leading to delays high on the mountain, and shorter weather windows. Someone who had summited previously noted that when the weather window opens, long lines form as everyone rushes to summit and get back down. Despite the number of deaths, reports indicated that a record 891 climbers summited in the spring 2019 climbing season. Although China has had permit restrictions, and Nepal requires a doctor to sign off on climbing permits, the natural dangers of climbing such as falls and avalanches combined with medical issues aggravated by Everest's extreme altitude led to 2019 being a year with a comparatively high death toll.\n2020s.\nBoth Nepal and China prohibited foreign climbing groups during the 2020 season, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 2020 saw no summits from the Nepal (South) Side.\nIn October 2025, blizzard-like conditions prompted Chinese authorities to evacuate nearly 350 people by October 6, with about 200 more stranded on the Everest Scenic Area.\nClimbing.\nPermits.\nIn 2014, Nepal issued 334 climbing permits, which were extended until 2019 due to the closure. In 2015, Nepal issued 357 permits, but the mountain was closed again because of the avalanche and earthquake, and these permits were given a two-year extension to 2017.\nIn 2017, a person who tried to climb Everest without the $11,000 permit was caught after he made it past the Khumbu icefall. He faced, among other penalties, a $22,000 fine and a possible four years in jail. In the end, he was allowed to return home but banned from mountaineering in Nepal for 10 years.\nThe number of permits issued each year by Nepal is:\nThe Chinese side in Tibet is also managed with permits for summiting Everest. They did not issue permits in 2008, due to the Olympic torch relay being taken to the summit of Mount Everest.\nIn March 2020, the governments of China and Nepal cancelled all climbing permits for Mount Everest due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2020, a group of Chinese mountaineers began an expedition from the Chinese side. The mountain remained closed on the Chinese side to all foreign climbers. On 10 May 2021, a separation line was announced by Chinese authorities to prevent the spread of coronavirus from climbers ascending Nepal's side.\nCommercial climbing.\nAccording to Jon Krakauer, the era of commercialisation of Everest started in 1985, when the summit was reached by a guided expedition led by David Breashears that included Richard Bass, a wealthy 55-year-old businessman and an amateur mountain climber with four years of climbing experience. By the early-1990s, several companies were offering guided tours to the mountain. Rob Hall, one of the mountaineers who died in the 1996 disaster, had successfully guided 39 clients to the summit before that incident.\nBy 2016, most guiding services cost between US$35,000 and US$200,000. Going with a \"celebrity guide\", usually a well-known mountaineer typically with decades of climbing experience and perhaps several Everest summits, can cost over \u00a3100,000 as of 2015. However, the services offered vary widely and it is \"buyer beware\" when doing deals in Nepal, one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world. Tourism contributed 7.9 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019 in a country with high unemployment, but an Everest porter can make nearly double the nation's average wage in a region in which other sources of income are lacking.\nCosts beyond the guiding service can vary widely. It is technically possible to reach the summit with minimal additional expenses, and there are \"budget\" travel agencies that offer logistical support for such trips. A limited support service, offering only some meals at base camp and bureaucratic overhead like a permit, can cost as little as US$7,000 as of 2007. However, this is considered difficult and dangerous (as illustrated by the case of David Sharp).\nClimbing gear required to reach the summit may cost in excess of US$8,000, and most climbers also use bottled oxygen, which adds around US$3,000. The permit to enter the Everest area from the south via Nepal costs US$10,000 to US$30,000 per person, depending on the size of the team. The ascent typically starts at one of the two base camps near the mountain, both of which are approximately from Kathmandu and from Lhasa (the two nearest cities with major airports). Transferring one's equipment from the airport to the base camp may add as much as US$2,000.\nMany climbers hire \"full service\" guide companies, which provide a wide spectrum of services, including the acquisition of permits, transportation to/from base camp, food, tents, fixed ropes, medical assistance while on the mountain, an experienced mountaineer guide, and even personal porters to carry one's backpack and cook one's meals. The cost of such a guide service may range from US$40,000 to $80,000 per person. Since most equipment is moved by Sherpas, clients of full-service guide companies can often keep their backpack weights under , or hire a Sherpa to carry their backpack for them. By contrast, climbers attempting less commercialised peaks, like Denali, are often expected to carry backpacks over and, occasionally, to tow a sled with of gear and food.\nThe degree of commercialisation of Mount Everest is a frequent subject of criticism. Jamling Tenzing Norgay, the son of Tenzing Norgay, said in a 2003 interview that his late father would have been shocked to discover that rich thrill-seekers with no climbing experience were now routinely reaching the summit, \"You still have to climb this mountain yourself with your feet. But the spirit of adventure is not there any more. It is lost. There are people going up there who have no idea how to put on crampons. They are climbing because they have paid someone $65,000. It is very selfish. It endangers the lives of others.\"\nOne example of this is Shriya Shah-Klorfine, who had to be taught how to put on crampons during her summit attempt in 2012. She paid at least US$40,000 to a new guiding company for the trip, and died when she ran out of oxygen during the descent after climbing for 27 hours straight.\nReinhold Messner concurred in 2004: You could die in each climb and that meant you were responsible for yourself. We were real mountaineers: careful, aware and even afraid. By climbing mountains we were not learning how big we were. We were finding out how breakable, how weak and how full of fear we are. You can only get this if you expose yourself to high danger. I have always said that a mountain without danger is not a mountain...High altitude alpinism has become tourism and show. These commercial trips to Everest, they are still dangerous. But the guides and organisers tell clients, 'Don't worry, it's all organised.' The route is prepared by hundreds of Sherpas. Extra oxygen is available in all camps, right up to the summit. People will cook for you and lay out your beds. Clients feel safe and don't care about the risks.\nBy 2015, Nepal was considering requiring that climbers have some experience, hoping this would both make the mountain safer and increase revenue. One barrier to this is that low-budget firms make money \"not\" taking inexperienced climbers to the summit. Those turned away by Western firms can often find another firm willing to take them for a price\u2014that they return home soon after arriving after base camp, or part way up the mountain.\nHowever, not all opinions on the subject among prominent mountaineers have been strictly negative. For example, Edmund Hillary stated in 2003 that while \"Having people pay $65,000 and then be led up the mountain by a couple of experienced guides...isn't really mountaineering at all\", he was pleased by the changes brought to Everest area by Westerners: I don't have any regrets because I worked very hard indeed to improve the condition for the local people. When we first went in there they didn't have any schools, they didn't have any medical facilities, all over the years we have established 27 schools, we have two hospitals and a dozen medical clinics and then we've built bridges over wild mountain rivers and put in fresh water pipelines so in cooperation with the Sherpas we've done a lot to benefit them.\nOne of the early guided summiters, Richard Bass (of Seven Summits fame) stated in 2003 that \"Climbers should have high altitude experience before they attempt the really big mountains. People don't realise the difference between a mountain and . It's not just arithmetic. The reduction of oxygen in the air is proportionate to the altitude alright, but the effect on the human body is disproportionate\u2014an exponential curve. People climb Denali [] or Aconcagua [] and think, 'Heck, I feel great up here, I'm going to try Everest.' But it's not like that.\"\nSpeed climbing.\nAltitude tents.\nSome expedition teams have clients use altitude tents to pre-acclimatise prior to leaving for the mountain. Compared to traditional Everest expeditions that last 50 to 60 days, altitude tents can reduce the expedition time frame to 30 to 35 days.\nXenon gas.\nIn 2025, four men climbed the mountain in one week. They claimed their inhalation of xenon gas 10 days prior to stimulate erythropoietin production had eliminated the need for altitude acclimatisation over several weeks. The International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation (UIAA) criticised the decision, citing that there is no evidence that the inhalation of xenon improves performance in high elevation environments. Furthermore, the UIAA warned that as an anesthetic, xenon gas could result in impaired brain function, respiratory compromise, and death if used in an unmonitored setting.\nSummiting with disabilities.\nSummiting Everest with disabilities has become popular in the 21st century. Sudarshan Gautam, a Canadian double-amputee, summited the mountain in 2013. In the same year, Eli Reimer, a teenager with Down syndrome, hiked to the South Base Camp as part of a fundraising effort for his father's foundation.\nRoutes.\nMount Everest has two main climbing routes, the Southeast Ridge from Nepal and the North Ridge from Tibet, as well as many other less frequently climbed routes. Of the two main routes, the Southeast Ridge is technically easier and more frequently used. It was the route used by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953 and the first recognised of 15 routes to the top by 1996. This was, however, a route decision dictated more by politics than by design, as the Chinese border was closed to the western world in the 1950s, after Annexation of Tibet by the People's Republic of China.\nMost attempts are made during May, before the summer monsoon season. As the monsoon season approaches, the jet stream shifts northward, thereby reducing the average wind speeds high on the mountain. While attempts are sometimes made in September and October, after the monsoons, when the jet stream is again temporarily pushed northward, the additional snow deposited by the monsoons and the less stable weather patterns at the monsoons' tail end makes climbing extremely difficult.\nSoutheast Ridge.\nThe ascent via the Southeast Ridge begins with a trek to Base Camp at on the south side of Everest, in Nepal. Expeditions usually fly into Lukla (2,860\u00a0m) from Kathmandu and pass through Namche Bazaar. Climbers then hike to Base Camp, which usually takes six to eight days, allowing for proper altitude acclimatisation in order to prevent altitude sickness. Climbing equipment and supplies are carried by yaks, dzopkyos (yak-cow hybrids), and human porters to Base Camp on the Khumbu Glacier. When Hillary and Tenzing climbed Everest in 1953, the British expedition they were part of (comprising over 400 climbers, porters, and Sherpas at that point) started from the Kathmandu Valley, as there were no roads further east at that time.\nClimbers spend a couple of weeks in Base Camp, acclimatising to the altitude. During that time, Sherpas and some expedition climbers set up ropes and ladders in the treacherous Khumbu Icefall.\nSeracs, crevasses, and shifting blocks of ice make the icefall one of the most dangerous sections of the route. Many climbers and Sherpas have been killed in this section. To reduce the hazard, climbers usually begin their ascent well before dawn, when the freezing temperatures glue ice blocks in place.\nAbove the icefall is Camp I at .\nFrom Camp I, climbers make their way up the Western Cwm to the base of the Lhotse Face, where Camp II or Advanced Base Camp (ABC) is established at . The Western Cwm is a flat, gently rising glacial valley, marked by huge lateral crevasses in the centre, which prevent direct access to the upper reaches of the Cwm. Climbers are forced to cross on the far right, near the base of Nuptse, to a small passageway known as the \"Nuptse corner\". The Western Cwm is also called the \"Valley of Silence\" as the topography of the area generally cuts off wind from the climbing route. The high altitude and a clear, windless day can make the Western Cwm unbearably hot for climbers.\nFrom Camp II, climbers ascend the Lhotse Face on fixed ropes, up to Camp III, located on a small ledge at . From there, it is another 500 metres to Camp IV on the South Col at .\nFrom Camp III to Camp IV, climbers are faced with two additional challenges: the Geneva Spur and the Yellow Band. The Geneva Spur is an anvil-shaped rib of black rock named by the 1952 Swiss expedition. Fixed ropes assist climbers in scrambling over this snow-covered rock band. The Yellow Band is a section of interlayered marble, phyllite, and semischist, which also requires about 100 metres of rope for traversing it.\nOn the South Col, climbers enter the death zone. Climbers making summit bids typically can endure no more than two or three days at this altitude. If the weather is not clear with low winds during these short few days, climbers are forced to descend, many all the way back down to Base Camp.\nFrom Camp IV, climbers begin their summit push around midnight, with hopes of reaching the summit (still another 1,000 metres above) within 10 to 12 hours. Climbers first reach \"The Balcony\" at , a small platform where they can rest and gaze at peaks to the south and east in the early light of dawn. Continuing up the ridge, climbers are then faced with a series of imposing rock steps which usually forces them to the east into the waist-deep snow, a serious avalanche hazard. At , a small table-sized dome of ice and snow marks the South Summit.\nFrom the South Summit, climbers follow the knife-edge Southeast Ridge along what is known as the \"Cornice traverse\", where snow clings to intermittent rock. This is the most exposed section of the climb, and a misstep to the left would send one down the Southwest Face, while to the immediate right is the Kangshung Face. At the end of this traverse is an imposing rock wall, the Hillary Step, at .\nHillary and Tenzing were the first climbers to ascend this step, and did so using primitive ice climbing equipment and ropes. Nowadays, climbers ascend using fixed ropes previously set up by Sherpas. Once above the step, it is a comparatively easy climb to the top on moderately angled snow slopes\u2014though the exposure on the ridge is extreme, especially while traversing large cornices of snow. With increasing numbers climbing the mountain, the Step has frequently become a bottleneck, with climbers forced to wait significant amounts of time for their turn on the ropes, leading to problems in getting climbers efficiently up and down the mountain.\nAfter the Hillary Step, climbers must traverse a loose and rocky section that has a large entanglement of fixed ropes that can be troublesome in bad weather. Climbers typically spend less than half an hour at the summit to allow time to descend to Camp IV before darkness sets in, to avoid serious problems with afternoon weather, or because supplemental oxygen tanks run out.\nNorth Ridge route.\nThe North Ridge route begins from the north side of Everest, in Tibet. Expeditions trek to the Rongbuk Glacier, setting up base camp at on a gravel plain just below the glacier. To reach Camp II, climbers ascend the medial moraine of the east Rongbuk Glacier up to the base of Changtse, at around . Camp III (ABC\u00a0\u2013 Advanced Base Camp) is situated below the North Col at . To reach Camp IV on the North Col, climbers ascend the glacier to the foot of the col where fixed ropes are used to reach the North Col at . From the North Col, climbers ascend the rocky North Ridge to set up Camp V at around . The route crosses the North Face in a diagonal climb to the base of the Yellow Band, reaching the site of Camp VI at . From Camp VI, climbers make their final summit push.\nClimbers face a treacherous traverse from the base of the First Step: ascending from , to the crux of the climb, the Second Step, ascending from . (The Second Step includes a climbing aid called the \"Chinese ladder\", a metal ladder placed semi-permanently in 1975 by a party of Chinese climbers. It has been almost continuously in place since, and ladders have been used by virtually all climbers on the route.) Once above the Second Step the inconsequential Third Step is clambered over, ascending from . Once above these steps, the summit pyramid is climbed by a snow slope of 50 degrees, to the final summit ridge along which the top is reached.\nSummit.\nThe summit of Everest has been described as \"the size of a dining room table\". The summit is capped with snow over ice over rock, and the layer of snow varies from year to year. The rock summit is made of Ordovician limestone and is a low-grade metamorphic rock. (See the Surveys section for more on its height and about the Everest rock summit.)\nBelow the summit, there is an area known as \"rainbow valley\", filled with dead bodies still wearing brightly coloured winter gear. Down to about is an area commonly called the \"death zone\", due to the high danger and low oxygen because of the low pressure.\nDeath zone.\nAt the higher regions of Mount Everest, climbers seeking the summit typically spend substantial time within the death zone (altitudes higher than ), and face significant challenges to survival. Temperatures can dip to very low levels, resulting in frostbite of any body part exposed to the air. Since temperatures are so low, snow is well-frozen in certain areas and death or injury by slipping and falling can occur. High winds at these altitudes on Everest are also a potential threat to climbers.\nAnother significant threat to climbers is low atmospheric pressure. The atmospheric pressure at the top of Everest is about a third of sea level pressure or , resulting in the availability of only about a third as much oxygen to breathe.\nA sea-level dweller exposed to the atmospheric conditions at the altitude above without acclimatisation would likely lose consciousness within two to three minutes. At sea level, blood oxygen saturation is generally 98 to 99 per cent. At base camp, blood saturation fell to between 85 and 87 per cent. Blood samples taken at the summit indicated very low oxygen levels in the blood. A side effect of low blood oxygen is a greatly increased breathing rate, often 80\u201390 breaths per minute as opposed to a more typical 20\u201330. Exhaustion can occur merely by attempting to breathe.\nLack of oxygen, exhaustion, extreme cold, and climbing hazards all contribute to the death toll. An injured person who cannot walk is in serious trouble, since rescue by helicopter is generally impractical and carrying the person off the mountain is very risky. People who die during the climb are typically left behind. As of 2015, over 200 bodies remain on the mountain.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Debilitating symptoms consistent with high altitude cerebral oedema commonly present during descent from the summit of Mount Everest. Profound fatigue and late times in reaching the summit are early features associated with subsequent death.\u2014\u200a\nA 2008 study noted that the \"death zone\" is indeed where most Everest deaths occur, but also noted that most deaths occur during descent from the summit. A 2014 article in \"The Atlantic\" about deaths on Everest noted that while falling is one of the greatest dangers the death zone presents for all 8000ers, avalanches are a more common cause of death at lower altitudes.\nDespite this, Everest is safer for climbers than a number of peaks by some measurements, but it depends on the period. Some examples are Kangchenjunga, K2, Annapurna, Nanga Parbat, and the Eiger (especially the \"nordwand\"). Some factors that affect total mountain lethality include the level of popularity of the mountain, the skill of those climbing, and the difficulty of the climb.\nAnother health hazard is retinal haemorrhages, which can damage eyesight and cause blindness. Up to a quarter of Everest climbers can experience retinal haemorrhages, and although they usually heal within weeks of returning to lower altitudes, in 2010 a climber went blind and died in the death zone.\nThe team made a huge effort for the next 12 hours to try to get him down the mountain, but to no avail, as they were unsuccessful in getting him through the difficult sections. Even for the able, Everest's Northeast Ridge is recognised as a challenge. It is hard to rescue someone who has become incapacitated and it can be beyond the ability of rescuers to save \"anyone\" in such a difficult spot. One way around this situation was pioneered by two Nepali men in 2011, who had intended to paraglide off the summit. They had no choice and were forced to go through with their plan anyway, because they had run out of bottled oxygen and supplies. They successfully launched off the summit and para-glided down to Namche Bazaar in just 42 minutes, without having to climb down the mountain.\nSupplemental oxygen.\nMost expeditions use oxygen masks and tanks above . Everest can be climbed without supplementary oxygen, but only by the most accomplished mountaineers and at increased risk. Low oxygen impairs cognition, and the combination of extreme weather, low temperatures, and steep slopes often requires quick, accurate decisions. While about 95 per cent of climbers who reach the summit use bottled oxygen in order to reach the top, about five per cent of climbers have summited Everest without supplemental oxygen. The death rate is double for those who attempt to reach the summit without supplemental oxygen. Travelling above altitude is a factor in cerebral hypoxia. One study found that Mount Everest may be the highest an acclimatised human could go, but also found that climbers may suffer permanent neurological damage despite returning to lower altitudes.\nThe use of bottled oxygen to ascend Mount Everest has been controversial. It was first used on the 1922 British Mount Everest Expedition by George Finch and Geoffrey Bruce who climbed up to at a spectacular speed of . Pinned down by a fierce storm, they escaped death by breathing oxygen from a jury-rigged set-up during the night. The next day they climbed to at \u2013 nearly three times as fast as non-oxygen users. Yet the use of oxygen was considered so unsportsmanlike that none of the rest of the Alpine world recognised this high ascent rate.\nGeorge Mallory described the use of such oxygen as unsportsmanlike, but he later concluded that it would be impossible for him to summit without it and consequently used it on his final attempt in 1924. When Tenzing and Hillary made the first successful summit in 1953, they also used open-circuit bottled oxygen sets, with the expedition's physiologist Griffith Pugh referring to the oxygen debate as a \"futile controversy\", noting that oxygen \"greatly increases subjective appreciation of the surroundings, which after all is one of the chief reasons for climbing.\" For the next twenty-five years, bottled oxygen was considered standard for any successful summit.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...although an acclimatised lowlander can survive for a time on the summit of Everest without supplemental oxygen, one is so close to the limit that even a modicum of excess exertion may impair brain function.\u2014\u200a\nReinhold Messner was the first climber to break the bottled oxygen tradition and in 1978, with Peter Habeler, made the first successful climb without it. In 1980, Messner summited the mountain solo, without supplemental oxygen or any porters or climbing partners, on the more difficult northwest route. Once the climbing community was satisfied that the mountain could be climbed without supplemental oxygen, many purists then took the next logical step of insisting that is how it \"should\" be climbed.\nThe aftermath of the 1996 disaster further intensified the debate. Jon Krakauer's \"Into Thin Air\" (1997) expressed the author's personal criticisms of the use of bottled oxygen. Krakauer wrote that the use of bottled oxygen allowed otherwise unqualified climbers to attempt to summit, leading to dangerous situations and more deaths. The disaster was partially caused by the sheer number of climbers (34 on that day) attempting to ascend, causing bottlenecks at the Hillary Step and delaying many climbers, most of whom summited after the usual 14:00 turnaround time. He proposed banning bottled oxygen except for emergency cases, arguing that this would both decrease the growing pollution on Everest\u2014many bottles have accumulated on its slopes\u2014and keep marginally qualified climbers off the mountain.\nThe 1996 disaster also introduced the issue of the guide's role in using bottled oxygen.\nGuide Anatoli Boukreev's decision not to use bottled oxygen was sharply criticised by Jon Krakauer. Boukreev's supporters (who include G. Weston DeWalt, who co-wrote \"The Climb\") state that using bottled oxygen gives a false sense of security. Krakauer and his supporters point out that, without bottled oxygen, Boukreev could not directly help his clients descend.\nThe low oxygen can cause a mental fog-like impairment of cognitive abilities described as \"delayed and lethargic thought process, clinically defined as bradypsychia\" even after returning to lower altitudes. In severe cases, climbers can experience hallucinations. Some studies have found that high-altitude climbers, including Everest climbers, experience altered brain structure.\nAutumn climbing.\nAlthough generally less popular than spring, Mount Everest has also been climbed in the autumn (also called the \"post-monsoon season\"). For example, in 2010 Eric Larsen and five Nepali guides summited Everest in the autumn for the first time in ten years. The autumn season, when the monsoon ends, is regarded as more dangerous because there is typically a lot of new snow which can be unstable. However, this increased snow can make it more popular with certain winter sports like skiing and snowboarding. Two Japanese climbers also summited in October 1973.\nChris Chandler and Bob Cormack summited Everest in October 1976 as part of the American Bicentennial Everest Expedition that year, the first Americans to make an autumn ascent of Mount Everest according to the \"Los Angeles Times\". By the 21st century, summer and autumn can be more popular with skiing and snowboard attempts on Mount Everest. During the 1980s, climbing in autumn was actually more popular than in spring. U.S. astronaut Karl Gordon Henize died in October 1993 on an autumn expedition, conducting an experiment on radiation. The amount of background radiation increases with higher altitudes.\nThe mountain has also been climbed in the winter, but that is not popular because of the combination of cold high winds and shorter days. By January the peak is typically battered by winds and the average temperature of the summit is around .\nThefts and crime.\nSome climbers have reported life-threatening thefts from supply caches. In May 2006, Vitor Negrete, the first Brazilian to climb Everest without oxygen and part of David Sharp's party, died during his descent, and theft of gear and food from his high-altitude camp may have contributed. In addition to theft, Michael Kodas describes in his book, \"High Crimes: The Fate of Everest in an Age of Greed\" (2008): unethical guides and Sherpas, prostitution and gambling at the Tibet Base Camp, fraud related to the sale of oxygen bottles, and climbers collecting donations under the pretense of removing trash from the mountain.\nThe Chinese side of Everest in Tibet was described as \"out of control\" in 2007 after one Canadian had all his gear stolen and was abandoned by his Sherpa. Another Sherpa helped the victim get off the mountain safely and gave him some spare gear. Other climbers have also reported missing oxygen bottles, which can be worth hundreds of dollars each. Hundreds of climbers pass by people's tents, making it hard to safeguard against theft. In the late 2010s, the reports of theft of oxygen bottles from camps became more common.\nTimeline.\nBy the end of the 2010 climbing season, there had been 5,104 ascents to the summit by about 3,142 individuals. Some notable \"firsts\" by climbers include:\nAviation.\n1933: Flight over Everest.\nLucy, Lady Houston, a British millionaire former showgirl, funded the Houston Everest Flight of 1933. A formation of airplanes led by the Marquess of Clydesdale flew over the summit in an effort to photograph the unknown terrain.\n1988: First climb and glide.\nOn 26 September 1988, having climbed the mountain via the Southeast Ridge, Jean-Marc Boivin made the first paraglider descent of Everest, in the process creating the record for the fastest descent of the mountain and the highest paraglider flight. Boivin said: \"I was tired when I reached the top because I had broken much of the trail, and to run at this altitude was quite hard.\" \n1991: Hot air balloon flyover.\nIn 1991, four men in two balloons achieved the first hot-air balloon flight over Mount Everest. In one balloon were Andy Elson and Eric Jones (cameraman), and in the other balloon Chris Dewhirst and Leo Dickinson (cameraman). Dickinson went on to write a book about the adventure called \"Ballooning Over Everest\". The hot-air balloons were modified to function at up to altitude. Reinhold Messner called one of Dickinson's panoramic views of Everest, captured on the now discontinued Kodak Kodachrome film, the \"best snap on Earth\", according to UK newspaper \"The Telegraph\". Dewhirst has offered to take passengers on a repeat of this feat for US$2.6\u00a0million per passenger.\n2005: Pilot summits with helicopter.\nIn May 2005, pilot Didier Delsalle of France landed a Eurocopter AS350 B3 helicopter on the summit of Mount Everest. He needed to land for two minutes to set the (FAI) official record, but he stayed for about four minutes, twice. In this type of landing the rotors stay engaged, which avoids relying on the snow to fully support the aircraft. The flight set rotorcraft world records, for highest of both landing and take-off.\nSome press reports suggested that the report of the summit landing was a misunderstanding of a South Col landing, but he had also landed on South Col two days earlier, with this landing and the Everest records confirmed by the FAI. Delsalle also rescued two Japanese climbers at while he was there. One climber noted that the new record meant a better chance of rescue.\n2011: Paraglide off summit.\nOn 21 May 2011, Nepalis Lakpa Tsheri Sherpa and Sano Babu Sunuwar paraglided from Everest's summit to Namche Bazaar in 42 minutes. After the flight they hiked, biked, and kayaked to the Indian Ocean, reaching the Bay of Bengal by 27 June 2011, thereby becoming the first people to complete a continuous summit-to-sea descent from Everest. They accomplished the ground-breaking feat despite Babu having never previously climbed, and Lakpa having never kayaked and not even knowing how to swim. The duo subsequently won National Geographic Adventurers of the Year for 2012 for their exploits. In 2013 footage of the flight was shown on the television news program \"Nightline\".\n2014: Helicopter-assisted ascent.\nIn 2014, a team financed and led by mountaineer Wang Jing used a helicopter to fly from South Base Camp to Camp II to avoid the Khumbu Icefall, and thence climbed to the Everest summit. This climb immediately sparked outrage and controversy in much of the mountaineering world over the legitimacy and propriety of her climb. Nepal ended up investigating Wang, who initially denied the claim that she had flown to Camp II, admitting only that some support crew were flown to that higher camp, over the Khumbu Icefall. In August 2014, however, she stated that she had flown to Camp II because the icefall was impassable. \"If you don't fly to Camp II, you just go home\", she said in an interview. In that same interview, she also insisted that she had never tried to hide this fact.\nHer team had had to use the south side because the Chinese had denied them a permit to climb. Ultimately, the Chinese refusal may have been beneficial to Nepal's interests, allowing the government to showcase improved local hospitals and providing the opportunity for a new hybrid aviation/mountaineering style, triggering discussions about helicopter use in the mountaineering world. National Geographic noted that a village festooned Wang with honours after she donated US$30,000 to the town's hospital. Wang won the International Mountaineer of the Year Award from the Nepal government in June 2014.\n2016: Helicopter business increases.\nIn 2016 the increased use of helicopters was noted for increased efficiency and for hauling material over the deadly Khumbu icefall. In particular it was noted that flights saved icefall porters 80 trips but still increased commercial activity at Everest. After many Nepalis died in the icefall in 2014, the government had wanted helicopters to handle more transportation to Camp 1 but this was not possible because of the 2015 earthquake closing the mountain, so this was then implemented in 2016 (helicopters did prove instrumental in rescuing many people in 2015 though). That summer Bell tested the 412EPI, which conducted a series of tests including hovering at and flying as high as altitude near Mount Everest.\nExtreme sports.\nMount Everest has been host to other winter sports and adventuring besides mountaineering, including snowboarding, skiing, paragliding, and BASE jumping.\nYuichiro Miura became the first man to ski down Everest in the 1970s. He descended nearly from the South Col before falling with extreme injuries. Stefan Gatt and Marco Siffredi snowboarded Mount Everest in 2001. Other Everest skiers include Davo Karni\u010dar of Slovenia, who completed a top to South Base Camp descent in 2000, Hans Kammerlander of Italy in 1996 on the north side, and Kit DesLauriers of the United States in 2006. Marco Siffredi died in 2002 on his second snow-boarding expedition.\nVarious types of gliding descents have slowly become more popular, and are noted for their rapid descents to lower camps. In 1986 Steve McKinney led an expedition to Mount Everest. Frenchman Jean-Marc Boivin made the first paraglider descent of Everest in September 1988, descending in minutes from the Southeast Ridge to a lower camp. In 2011, two Nepalis made a gliding descent from the Everest summit down in 45 minutes. \nReligious significance.\nThe southern part of Mount Everest is regarded as one of several \"hidden valleys\" of refuge designated by Padmasambhava, a ninth-century \"lotus-born\" Buddhist saint.\nNear the base of the north side of Everest lies Rongbuk Monastery, which has been called the \"sacred threshold to Mount Everest, with the most dramatic views of the world.\" For Sherpas living on the slopes of Everest in the Khumbu region of Nepal, Rongbuk Monastery is an important pilgrimage site, accessed in a few days of travel across the Himalayas through Nangpa La.\nMiyolangsangma, a Tibetan Buddhist \"Goddess of Inexhaustible Giving\", is believed to have lived at the top of Mount Everest. According to Sherpa Buddhist monks, Mount Everest is Miyolangsangma's palace and playground, and all climbers are only partially welcome guests, having arrived without invitation.\nThe Sherpa people also believe that Mount Everest and its flanks are blessed with spiritual energy, and one should show reverence when passing through this sacred landscape. Here, the karmic effects of one's actions are magnified, and impure thoughts are best avoided.\nWaste management.\nIn 2015, the president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association warned that pollution, especially human waste, has reached critical levels. As much as of human excrement each season is left behind on the mountain. Human waste is strewn across the verges of the route to the summit, making the four sleeping areas on the route up Everest's south side minefields of human excrement. Climbers above Base Camp\u2014for the 62-year history of climbing on the mountain\u2014have most commonly either buried their excrement in holes they dug by hand in the snow, or slung it into crevasses, or simply defecated wherever convenient, often within metres of their tents. The only place where climbers can defecate without worrying about contaminating the mountain is Base Camp. At approximately , Base Camp sees the most activity of all camps on Everest because climbers acclimate and rest there. In the late-1990s, expeditions began using toilets that they fashioned from blue plastic barrels fitted with a toilet seat and enclosed.\nThe problem of human waste is compounded by the presence of more anodyne waste: spent oxygen tanks, abandoned tents, empty cans and bottles. The Nepali government now requires each climber to pack out eight kilograms of waste when descending the mountain.\nIn February 2019, due to the mounting waste problem, China closed the base camp on its side of Everest to visitors without climbing permits. Tourists are allowed to go as far as the Rongbuk Monastery.\nIn April 2019, the Solukhumbu district's Khumbu Pasanglhamu Rural Municipality launched a campaign to collect nearly of garbage from Everest. Five years later, 2024, waste removal is receiving continuing attention.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

More than 1.5 million people are buried in the cemetery, including a number of notable historical figures.\nEstablished as a non-denominational garden cemetery by Daniel O'Connell in 1832, the cemetery is in size and contains the gravesites of a number of historical figures, including Charles Stewart Parnell, \u00c9amon de Valera, Constance Markievicz and Michael Collins.\nOverseen by Dublin Cemeteries Trust, Glasnevin remains an active cemetery and cremation site. The cemetery contains a visitor centre, the landmark O'Connell Tower, and runs guided tours of the grounds.\nHistory.\nFounding.\nPrior to the establishment of Glasnevin Cemetery, Irish Catholics had no cemeteries of their own in which to bury their dead and, as the repressive Penal Laws of the eighteenth century placed heavy restrictions on the public performance of Catholic services, it had become normal practice for Catholics to conduct a limited version of their own funeral services in Protestant churchyards or graveyards. \nThis situation continued until an incident at a funeral held at St. Kevin's Churchyard in 1823 provoked public outcry when a Protestant sexton reprimanded a Catholic priest for proceeding to perform a limited version of a funeral mass.\nThe outcry prompted Daniel O'Connell, champion of Catholic rights, to push for the opening of a burial ground in which both Irish Catholics and Protestants could give their dead dignified burial. Due to the limited space for burials at Goldenbridge Cemetery in Inchicore, the nine-acre plot of land was purchased at Glasnevin, subsequently consecrated and opened to the public for the first time on 21 February 1832. The first burial, that of eleven-year-old Michael Carey from Francis Street in Dublin, took place on the following day in a section of the cemetery known as Curran's Square.\n19th century.\nThe cemetery was initially known as Prospect Cemetery, a name chosen from the townland of Prospect, which surrounded the cemetery lands. Besides the famous interred at Glasnevin, nearly 800,000 people have been buried in Glasnevin in unmarked mass graves due to the death toll from the Great Famine of the 1840s and a later cholera epidemic.\nThe high wall with watchtowers surrounding the main part of the cemetery was built to deter bodysnatchers, who were active in Dublin in the 18th and early 19th centuries. The watchmen also had a pack of bloodhounds who roamed the cemetery at night.\nFollowing his death in 1847, Daniel O'Connell was initially buried in an area of the cemetery now known as the Old O'Connell Circle. In 1869, after the completion of the 55-metre tall O'Connell Tower, his remains were reinterred in a crypt located at the base of the monument. \nThroughout the 19th century, the cemetery played host to a number of large funerals and commemorations. This included the funeral of Charles Stewart Parnell in October 1891, which has subsequently been marked annually as \"Ivy Day\".\n20th century.\nOriginally covering nine acres of ground, the area of the cemetery expanded throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, to approximately 124 acres, including St. Paul's section on the southern side of the Finglas Road, which opened in 1908. \nDuring the Irish revolutionary period, Glasnevin Cemetery was the site of the funeral of Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa. The graveside oration, delivered by Patrick Pearse at O'Donovan Rossa's funeral on 1 August 1915, had an impact on the mobilisation of Irish republicans and set the stage for the Easter Rising eight months later.\nThe funeral procession of Michael Collins to Glasnevin Cemetery on 28 August 1922 was the largest in the cemetery's history, with an estimated 500,000 people, one-fifth of the population of Ireland, lining the streets of Dublin to pay tribute.\nIn January 1971, a gelignite bomb was planted at the base of the O'Connell Tower, demolishing the original staircase and causing minor damage to the structure and the O'Connell crypt. The bombing was later attributed to Ulster loyalists in retaliation for the destruction of Nelson's Pillar on O'Connell Street in 1966. \nIn March 1982, the first crematorium in the Republic of Ireland was opened within the grounds of the cemetery. In subsequent decades, cremation services have grown in popularity.\n21st century.\nOver the latter decades of the 20th century, due to lack of funding, the cemetery entered a period of decline, which was reversed following the beginning of a restoration project intended on restoring the cemetery as both a visitor attraction and a centre for national remembrance. As part of the restoration programme, Glasnevin Cemetery Museum, designed by A&amp;D Wejchert &amp; Partners Architects was opened in March 2010, hosting guided tours, themed exhibitions and support for genealogists and those studying family history. \nIn 2009, Glasnevin Trust in co-operation with the Commonwealth War Graves Commission began identifying the graves of Irish service personnel who died while serving in the Commonwealth forces during the two world wars. These names were inscribed on two memorials, rededicated and relocated in 2011 to near the main entrance. A Cross of Sacrifice was erected in the cemetery, in a joint Irish-British commemoration ceremony, to mark the First World War centenary. As of July 2019, there were 215 service personnel of the Commonwealth of both wars identified as buried here.\nGlasnevin Cemetery was a focal point of national commemoration during the decade of centenaries between 2012 and 2022, including a state ceremony marking the centenary of the Easter Rising, and a visit by then-Prince Charles in 2017 to acknowledge those buried in the cemetery who were killed in the World Wars and the struggle for Irish independence.\nAs part of the cemetery's restoration project, the staircase of the O'Connell Tower was rebuilt using the structure's original plans, and was officially reopened to visitors in April 2018.\nLocation.\nThe cemetery is located in Glasnevin, Dublin, in two parts. The main part, with its high walls and watchtowers, is located on one side of the road from Finglas to the city centre, while the other part, St. Paul's, is located across the road and beyond a green space, between two railway lines. A gateway into the National Botanic Gardens, adjacent to the cemetery, was reopened in recent years.\nFeatures.\nMemorials and graves.\nThe cemetery contains the graves of a number of Ireland's most prominent national figures. These include the graves of Daniel O'Connell, Charles Stewart Parnell, Michael Collins, \u00c9amon de Valera, Arthur Griffith, Maude Gonne, Kevin Barry, Roger Casement, Constance Markievicz, Se\u00e1n MacBride, Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa, James Larkin, Brendan Behan, Christy Brown and Luke Kelly of the Dubliners.\nThe grave of Michael Collins, the nationalist leader who was killed in the Irish Civil War in 1922, is among the most visited sites in Glasnevin. Around him were buried at least 183 soldiers of the Irish Free State. In 1967, their names were recorded on a memorial around Collin's grave.\nIn 1993, a mass grave at the site of a Magdalene laundry, institutions used to house \"fallen women\", was discovered after the convent which ran the laundry sold the land to a property developer. The remains were cremated and reburied in a mass grave at Glasnevin Cemetery, with the cost of the reburial split between the religious institutions involved and the developer who had bought the land.\nAngels plot.\nGlasnevin is one of a small number of cemeteries that allowed stillborn babies to be buried in consecrated ground and contains an area called the Angels Plot.\nCrematorium.\nIn 1982, a crematorium was constructed within the cemetery grounds by Glasnevin Trust. Since then, the service has been used for people of various religious denominations who wished to be cremated.\nReligious services.\nCatholic Mass is celebrated by members of the local parish clergy every Sunday. An annual blessing of the graves takes place each summer as it has done since the foundation of the cemetery in 1832.\nIn popular culture.\nGlasnevin Cemetery is the setting for the \"Hades\" episode in James Joyce's 1922 novel \"Ulysses\", and is mentioned by Idris Davies in his poem \"Eire\". Portions of the 1967 film \"Ulysses\", directed by Joseph Strick, were filmed at Glasnevin Cemetery.\nThe gate of the cemetery, as well as the nearby pub John Kavanagh's 'The Gravediggers', were featured in the 1970 comedy film \"Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx\".\nShane MacThomais, the cemetery's historian, was the author and contributor to a number of published works on the cemetery, prior to his death in March 2014.\nThe documentary \"One Million Dubliners\" was released in 2014, featuring stories about the history and operation of the cemetery.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Curry is best known for his work in combinatory logic, whose initial concept is based on a paper by Moses Sch\u00f6nfinkel, for which Curry did much of the development. Curry is also known for Curry's paradox and the Curry\u2013Howard correspondence. Named for him are three programming languages: Haskell, Brook, and Curry, and the concept of \"currying\", a method to transform functions, used in mathematics and computer science.\nLife.\nCurry was born on (1900--) 12, 1900 in Millis, Massachusetts, to Samuel Silas Curry and Anna Baright Curry, who ran a school for elocution. He entered Harvard University in 1916 to study medicine but switched to mathematics before graduating in 1920. After two years of graduate work in electrical engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), he returned to Harvard to study physics, earning a Master of Arts (M.A.) in 1924. Curry's interest in mathematical logic began during this period when he was introduced to the Principia Mathematica, the attempt by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell to ground mathematics in symbolic logic. Remaining at Harvard, Curry pursued a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in mathematics. While he was directed by George David Birkhoff to work on differential equations, his interests continued to shift to logic. In 1927, while an instructor at Princeton University, he discovered the work of Moses Sch\u00f6nfinkel in combinatory logic. Sch\u00f6nfinkel's work had anticipated much of Curry's own research, and as a consequence, he moved to University of G\u00f6ttingen where he could work with Heinrich Behmann and Paul Bernays, who were familiar with Sch\u00f6nfinkel's work. Curry was supervised by David Hilbert and worked closely with Bernays, receiving a Ph.D. in 1930 with a dissertation on combinatory logic.\nIn 1928, before leaving for G\u00f6ttingen, Curry married Mary Virginia Wheatley. The couple lived in Germany while Curry completed his dissertation, then, in 1929, moved to State College, Pennsylvania where Curry accepted a position at Pennsylvania State College. They had two children, Anne Wright Curry (July 27, 1930) and Robert Wheatley Curry (July 6, 1934). Curry remained at Penn State for the next 37 years. He spent one year at University of Chicago in 1931\u20131932 under a National Research Fellowship and one year in 1938\u20131939 at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. In 1942 he took a leave of absence to do applied mathematics for the United States government during World War II, notably at the Frankford Arsenal. Immediately after the war he worked on the ENIAC project, in 1945 and 1946. Under a Fulbright fellowship, he collaborated with Robert Feys in Louvain, Belgium. After retiring from Penn State in 1966, Curry accepted a position at the University of Amsterdam. In 1970, after finishing the second volume of his treatise on the combinatory logic, Curry retired from the University of Amsterdam and returned to State College, Pennsylvania.\nHaskell Curry died on , in State College, Pennsylvania.\nWork.\nThe focus of Curry's work were attempts to show that combinatory logic could provide a foundation for mathematics. Towards the end of 1933, he learned of the Kleene\u2013Rosser paradox from correspondence with John Rosser. The paradox, developed by Rosser and Stephen Kleene, had proved the inconsistency of a number of related formal systems, including one proposed by Alonzo Church (a system which had the lambda calculus as a consistent subsystem) and Curry's own system. However, unlike Church, Kleene, and Rosser, Curry did not give up on the foundational approach, saying that he did not want to \"run away from paradoxes.\"\nBy working in the area of Combinatory Logic for his entire career, Curry essentially became the founder and biggest name in the field. Combinatory logic is the foundation for one style of functional programming language. The power and scope of combinatory logic are quite similar to that of the lambda calculus of Church, and the latter formalism has tended to predominate in recent decades.\nDuring World War II, Curry worked at the Frankford Arsenal,\nwhere he developed a \"steepest descent\" algorithm, based on work by Cauchy.\nThis became a foundational example of modern gradient descent methods.\nIn 1947 Curry also described one of the first high-level programming languages and provided the first description of a procedure to convert a general arithmetic expression into a code for one-address computer.\nHe taught at Harvard, Princeton, and from 1929 to 1966, at the Pennsylvania State University. In 1942, he published Curry's paradox. In 1966 he became professor of logic and its history and philosophy of exact sciences at the University of Amsterdam, the successor of Evert Willem Beth.\nCurry also wrote and taught mathematical logic more generally; his teaching in this area culminated in his 1963 \"Foundations of Mathematical Logic\". His preferred philosophy of mathematics was formalism (cf. his 1951 book), following his mentor Hilbert, but his writings betray substantial philosophical curiosity and a very open mind about intuitionistic logic.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "42183", "revid": "196446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42183", "title": "Chiron", "text": "Centaur from Greek mythology\nIn Greek mythology, Chiron ( ; also Cheiron or Kheiron; ) was held to be the superlative centaur amongst his brethren since he was called the \"wisest and justest of all the centaurs\".\nBiography.\nChiron was notable throughout Greek mythology for his youth-nurturing nature. His personal skills tend to match those of his foster father Apollo, who taught the young centaur the art of medicine, herbs, music, archery, hunting, gymnastics, and prophecy, and made him rise above his beastly nature. Chiron was known for his knowledge and skill with medicine, and thus was credited with the discovery of botany and pharmacy, the science of herbs and medicine.\nLike satyrs, centaurs were notorious for being wild, lusty, overly indulgent drinkers and carousers, violent when intoxicated, and generally uncultured delinquents. Chiron, by contrast, was intelligent, civilized, and kind because he was not related directly to the other centaurs due to his parentage. He was the son of the Titan Cronus and the Oceanid Philyra, and thus possible brother to Dolops and Aphrus, the ancestor and eponym of the Aphroi, i.e. the native Africans. Chiron lived predominantly on Mount Pelion; there he married the nymph Chariclo who bore him three daughters, Hippe (also known as Melanippe meaning the \"black mare\" or Euippe, \"good mare\"), Ende\u00efs, and Ocyrhoe, and one son Carystus. A different source also stated that his wife was called Nais while a certain Aristaeus was called his son.\nLike the other centaurs, Chiron was later expelled by the Lapithae from his home; but sacrifices were offered to him there by the Magnesians until a very late period, and the family of the Cheironidae in that neighbourhood, who were distinguished for their knowledge of medicine, were regarded as his descendants.\nPhysical appearance.\nAlthough a centaur, Chiron's physical appearance often differs somewhat from other centaurs, demonstrating his status and heritage. In traditional Greek representations of Chiron his front legs are human, rather than equine. This is in contrast to the traditional representation of centaurs, which have the entire lower body of a horse. This clearly sets Chiron apart from the other centaurs, making him easily identifiable. This difference may also have highlighted Chiron's unique lineage, being the son of Cronus. Chiron is often depicted carrying a branch with dead hares he has caught hanging from it. Chiron is also often depicted wearing clothes, demonstrating he is more civilised and unlike a normal centaur (the only other occasional exceptions to this rule are the centaurs Nessus and Pholus).\nThe \"Education of Achilles\" wall painting, from the basilica in Herculaneum (top right), is one of the most common Roman depictions of Chiron, as he teaches Achilles the lyre. In this version we see Chiron with a fully equine lower body, in contrast to the ancient Greek representations. In addition to this reconfiguration, Chiron's appearance is further altered with his ears. Whereas previously human, Chiron's ears now match those of a satyr; folded over at the top. This rendering creates a more bestial version of Chiron, much more akin to a standard centaur. It may be possible that due to the rise of written sources, Roman artists were inspired by written descriptions of Chiron; simply using the word centaur, rather than having available traditional visual representations. This may, then, not be a deliberate reworking of the Chiron myth on the part of the Romans, but simply a lost nuance of the character in its migration from Greece to Rome. As F. Kelsey writes; \"The Chiron of our painting, ... has a body like that of the other centaurs, but the prominence of the human element in his nature is no less marked; he is the wise and gentle teacher, the instructor of an art\". Chiron has retained an element of clothing and gained a laurel wreath, suggesting the artist wished to portray nobility, or even divinity, more consistent with the traditional view. It has also been suggested that this fresco is a reproduction of an actual statue in the Roman forum.\nMythology.\nEarly years.\nAccording to an archaic myth, Chiron was sired by the Titan Cronus when he had taken the form of a horse and impregnated the nymph Philyra. In another version his mother was the nymph Na\u00efs.\nChiron's lineage was different from other centaurs, who were born from Ixion, consigned to a fiery wheel, and Nephele (\"cloud\"), which in the Olympian telling Zeus invented to look like Hera.\nSoon after giving birth to Chiron, Philyra abandoned her child out of shame and disgust. Chiron, effectively orphaned, was later found by the god Apollo, who took him under his wing and taught him the art of music, lyre, archery, medicine and prophecy. Apollo's twin sister, Artemis, trained him in archery and hunting. Chiron's uniquely peaceful character, kindness, and intelligence are attributed to Apollo and Artemis.\nSome sources speculate that Chiron was originally a Thessalian god, later subsumed into the Greek pantheon as a centaur.\nA great healer, astrologer, and respected oracle, Chiron was said to be the first among centaurs and highly revered as a teacher and tutor. Among his pupils were many culture heroes: Asclepius, Aristaeus, Actaeon, Achilles, Jason, Medus.\nThere is also a persistent link with Peleus throughout Chiron's myth. This can be explained that the latter was the grandfather of Peleus through his daughter Endeis who married the king of Aegina, Aeacus. Chiron saved the life of Peleus when Acastus tried to kill him by taking his sword and leaving him out in the woods to be slaughtered by the centaurs. Chiron retrieved the sword for Peleus. Chiron then explained to Peleus how to capture the nymph Thetis, leading to their marriage.\nChiron is also connected with the story of the Argonauts, whom he received kindly when they came to his residence on their voyage, for many of the heroes were his friends and pupils.\nStudents.\nChiron was a renowned mentor, and brought up some future heroes such as:\nAccording to Ptolemy Hephaestion (probably the same as Ptolemaeus Chennus), a writer and playwright whose works are now lost, Chiron was also the mentor of the god Dionysus (who became the centaur's eromenos, and learned from him chants and dances) and of a youth named Cocytus; the latter supposedly cured Adonis when he was wounded by a wild boar using the medical techniques learned from his teacher. It is worthy of note that Ptolemy's account only survived thanks to Photios I's summary of his works. Photios I, an ecumenical patriarch of the 9th century AD, harshly criticized Ptolemy, denouncing him for seemingly distorting, inventing and misinterpreting myths. Considering little is known about Ptolemy and his works are not preserved, it is unknown whether he was simply reporting alternative versions of myths or making them up.\nDeath.\nHis nobility is further reflected in the story of his death, as Prometheus sacrificed his life, allowing mankind to obtain the use of fire. As the son of Cronus he was immortal, so it was left to Heracles to arrange a bargain with Zeus to exchange Chiron's immortality for the life of Prometheus who had been chained to a rock where an eagle pecked out his regenerating liver for his transgressions. Chiron was pierced with an arrow belonging to Heracles that had been treated with the blood of the Hydra, or, in other versions, poison that Chiron had given to the hero when he had been under the honorable centaur's tutelage. According to a \"Scholium\" on Theocritus, this had taken place during the visit of Heracles to the cave of Pholus on Mount Pelion in Thessaly during his fourth labour, defeating the Erymanthian Boar. While they were at supper, Heracles asked for some wine to accompany his meal. Pholus, who ate his food raw, was taken aback. He had been given a vessel of sacred wine by Dionysus sometime earlier, to be kept in trust by the centaurs until the right time for its opening. At Heracles' prompting, Pholus was forced to produce the vessel of sacred wine. The hero, gasping for wine, grabbed it from him and forced it open. Thereupon the vapors of the sacred wine wafted out of the cave and intoxicated the wild centaurs led by Nessus who had gathered outside. They attacked with stones and fir trees the cave which was located in the neighbourhood of Malea. Heracles was forced to shoot many arrows (poisoned with the blood of the Hydra) to drive them back. During the assault, Chiron was hit in the thigh by one of the poisoned arrows. After the centaurs had fled, Pholus emerged from the cave to observe the destruction. Being of a philosophical frame of mind, he pulled one of the arrows from the body of a dead centaur and wondered how such a little thing as an arrow could have caused so much death and destruction. In that instant, he let slip the arrow from his hand and it dropped and hit him in the hoof, killing him instantly. This, however, is open to controversy, because Pholus shared the \"civilized centaur\" form with Chiron in some art images, and thus would have been immortal.\nIronically, Chiron, the master of the healing arts, could not heal himself and willingly gave up his immortality. For this reason, his half-brother Zeus took pity on him and thus placed him among the stars in the sky to be honored. The Greeks identified him as the constellation Centaurus.\nIn Ovid's poem \"Fasti\", Ovid has the hero Hercules visiting Chiron's home on Pelion while the child Achilles is there. While Chiron is examining Hercules' weapons, one of the arrows dipped in Lernaean hydra venom falls on Chiron's left foot and poisons him:\nAnd while the old man fingered the shafts clotted with poison, one of the arrows fell out of the quiver and stuck in his left foot. Chiron groaned and drew the steel from his body.\nChiron then tries to use herbs to heal himself, but fails. After nine days with a weeping Achilles looking on, Chiron passes into the stars becoming a constellation.\nThe \"Precepts of Chiron\".\nA didactic poem, \"Precepts of Chiron\", has been lost. However, fragments in heroic hexameters that survive in quotations are considered to belong to it. The common thread in the fragments, which may reflect in some degree the Acharnian image of Chiron and his teaching, is that it is expository rather than narrative, and suggests that, rather than recounting the inspiring events of archaic times as men like Nestor or Glaucus might do, Chiron taught the primeval ways of mankind, the gods and nature, beginning with the caution \"First, whenever you come to your house, offer good sacrifices to the eternal gods\".\nStatius' \"Achilleid\".\n\"The Achilleid\" was to be an epic poem on the life of Achilles. However, its author, Statius, died during the writing of the second book late in the first century AD during the reign of the Emperor Domitian. \"The Achilleid\" shows the relationship between Chiron and his charge, Achilles. During Book One, the close relationship between Chiron and Achilles is made clear when Thetis spends the evening with them in Chiron's cave on Mount Pelion, before leaving with Achilles. Chiron is shown in a paternal capacity, rather than that of merely a teacher, and is depicted as far from animal. Night draws to slumber. The huge Centaur collapses on stone and Achilles fondly twines himself about his shoulders, though his mother is there, preferring the familiar bosom. \"(\"1.195\u201397). Here, Statius is showing a loving relationship between the two characters, which the traditional view of Chiron never explored. Later, when describing what he ate when growing up, Achilles refers to Chiron as a parent; \"\"thus that father of mine used to feed me\" (\"2.102), the Latin used here is 'pater' so we may judge this an accurate translation. This further demonstrates the nature of the loving relationship between Chiron and Achilles. Statius here may be continuing a theme started by Ovid in \"Fasti\" several years earlier.\nIn \"Fasti\", on Chiron's death, Achilles says \"\"'Live, I beg you; don't leave me, dear father [pater]!'\"(\"5.412), this would suggest that in Rome the reconfiguration of Chiron's myth was as a loving and loved foster parent, rather than simply teacher. Chiron's relationship with his pupil is used to demonstrate a Roman longing for the father-son relationship.\nIn addition to Chiron's loving characteristics developed in Book One, Book Two of \"The Achilleid\" has Achilles describe many tasks Chiron would make him perform during his heroic education, including standing in fast flowing rivers;I stood, but the angry river and the mist of his broad rush took me back. He bore down on me with savage threats and scolded to shame me. I did not leave till ordered (2.146\u2013150). There is a clear contrast here in the hardship and insults Chiron is directing at his pupil compared to his previous kindness. However, this duality can be seen as a demonstration of a traditional Roman education, especially a noble one; learning both military and refined arts. Centaurs in antiquity were often remembered for their battle with the Lapiths. Statius deliberately disassociates Chiron from this story with his description of Chiron's cave on Pelion,Here are no darts that have tasted human blood, no ash trees fractured in festive combats, nor mixing bowls shattered upon kindred foes (1.111\u201315).Instead of combat, the emphasis is that Chiron's weapons are only used for hunting and there are no signs of savage behaviour. In addition to Achilles' descriptions of the physical lessons Chiron gives him he also refers to a more cultured education, He fixed in my mind the precepts of sacred justice (2.163\u20134). Statius creates an image of Chiron that is not only a loving father, but a strict and wise teacher, disassociated with the bestial aspects of centaurs.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Katowice is a central part of the Metropolis GZM, with a population of 2.3 million, and a part of a larger Katowice\u2013Ostrava metropolitan area that extends into the Czech Republic and has a population of around 5 million people, making it one of the most populous metropolitan areas in the European Union.\nKatowice was founded as a village in the 16th century, whereas several modern districts of Katowice were founded as villages in the Middle Ages. Throughout the mid-18th century, Katowice grew following the discovery of rich coal reserves in the area. In the first half of the 19th century, intensive industrialization transformed local mills and farms into industrial steelworks, mines, foundries and artisan workshops. The city has since reshaped its economy from a heavy industry-based one to professional services, education and healthcare. The entire metropolitan area is the 16th most economically powerful city by GDP in the European Union with an output amounting to $114.5\u00a0billion. Katowice Special Economic Zone is ranked fourth on the list of the TOP10 Global Free Zones.\nKatowice has been classified as a Gamma \u2013 global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network and is a centre of commerce, business, transportation, and culture in southern Poland, with numerous public companies headquartered in the city or in its suburbs including energy group Tauron and metal industry corporation Fasing, important cultural institutions such as Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra, award-winning music festivals such as Off Festival and , and transportation infrastructure such as Katowice Korfanty Airport. It also hosts the finals of Intel Extreme Masters, an Esports video game tournament. Katowice is also home to several institutions of higher learning, notably the University of Silesia, the Silesian University of Technology and the Karol Szymanowski Academy of Music. The city is a member of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network having been recognized as a City of Music.\nHistory.\nBefore the industrial revolution.\nThe area around Katowice, in Upper Silesia, has been inhabited by Lechitic Silesian tribes from its earliest documented history. While the name Katowice (\"Katowicze\") is mentioned for the first time in 1598, other villages and settlements that would eventually become parts of modern Katowice have been established earlier, with \"D\u0105b\" being the oldest, mentioned in 1299 for the first time in a document issued by Duke Casimir of Bytom. Bogucice, Ligota, Szopenice and Podlesie were all established in early 14th century. Aside from farming, people living in the area would also work in hammer mills: the first one, \"Ku\u017anica Bogucka\", is mentioned in 1397.\nThe area which would become Katowice was initially ruled by the Polish Silesian Piast dynasty until its extinction. From 1327, the region was under administration of the Kingdom of Bohemia under the Holy Roman Empire. As part of the Bohemian Crown, it was passed to the Habsburg monarchy of Austria in 1526. In 1742, along with most of Silesia, it was seized by Prussia following the First Silesian War. The two subsequent Silesian Wars left the area severely depopulated and with an economy in ruins. In 1838, Franz von Winckler bought Katowice from Karl Friedrich Lehmann and in 1841, he made it the headquarters of his estate.\nEmergence as an industrial centre.\nOn 3 October 1846, the works of the final stage of the Breslau-Myslowitz (\"Wroc\u0142aw-Mys\u0142owice\") rail line ended, built and operated by the Upper Silesian Railway. It was opened by king Frederick William IV of Prussia. A year later, on 6 August 1847, the first train arrived at the new Katowice station.\nThe railway connection with major European cities (Katowice gained connections to Berlin, Krak\u00f3w, Vienna and Warsaw, among others, between 1847 and 1848) fostered economic and population growth. The population grew enough to erect the first Lutheran church on 29 September 1858 (Church of the Resurrection), and the first Catholic church two years later, on 11 November 1860. Katowice (then called Kattowitz) gained city status on 11 September 1865 in the Prussian Province of Silesia, by the act of the king Wilhelm I Hohenzollern.\nThe city flourished due to large mineral (especially coal) deposits in the area. Extensive city growth and prosperity depended on the coal mining and steel industries, which took off during the Industrial Revolution. The city was inhabited mainly by Germans, Poles incl. Silesians, and Jews. In 1884, 36 Jewish Zionist delegates met here, forming the Hovevei Zion movement. Previously part of the Beuthen district, in 1873 it became the capital of the new Kattowitz district. On 1 April 1899, the city was separated from the district, becoming an independent city.\nIn 1882, the Upper Silesian Coal and Steelworks Company (\"Oberschlesischer Berg- und H\u00fcttenm\u00e4nnischer Verein\") moved its headquarters to Katowice, followed by creation of the Upper Silesian Coal Convention (\"Oberschlesische Kohlen-Konvention\") in 1898. Civic development followed industrial development: in 1851, the first post office opens in Katowice, and in 1893 the current regional post office headquarters have been opened; in 1871 the first middle school was opened (later expanded to high school); in 1889, Katowice got a district court; in 1895, the city bath opened and regional headquarters of the Prussian state railways has been established in the city; in 1907, the city theater (currently the Silesian Theatre) opened.\nUnder the Treaty of Versailles after World War I, the Upper Silesia plebiscite was organised by the League of Nations. Though Kattowitz proper voted 22,774 to remain in Germany and 3,900 for Poland, it was attached to Poland as the larger district voted 66,119 for Poland and 52,992 for Germany. Following the Silesian Uprisings of 1918\u201321 Katowice became part of the Second Polish Republic with some autonomy for the Silesian Parliament as a constituency and the Silesian Voivodeship Council as the executive body. In 1924, the surrounding villages and towns were incorporated into Katowice, and the number of inhabitants increased to over 112,000, since then the number of Poles exceeded the number of Germans \u2013 throughout the interwar period, the number of Germans decreased (in 1925 they constituted 12% of the inhabitants of Katowice, and in 1939 only 6%, while Poles constituted 93%). At the end of the interwar period, the number of inhabitants exceeded 134,000.\nFrom 1926 to 1933, Katowice and the Polish part of Upper Silesia were connected with Gdynia and the Polish part of Pomerania through the Polish Coal Trunk-Line ().\nWorld War II.\nDuring the early stages of World War II and the Poland Campaign, Katowice was essentially abandoned by the Polish Land Forces, which had to position itself around Krak\u00f3w. Nevertheless, the city was defended by local Poles, and the invading Germans immediately carried out massacres of captured Polish defenders. In the following weeks the German \"Einsatzkommando 1\" was stationed in the city, and its units were responsible for many crimes against Poles committed in the region.\nUnder German occupation many of the city's historical and iconic monuments were destroyed, most notably the Great Katowice Synagogue, which was burned to the ground on 4 September 1939. This was followed by the alteration of street names and the introduction of strict rules. Additionally, the use of Polish in public conversations was banned. The German administration was also infamous for organising public executions of civilians and by the middle of 1941, most of the Polish and Jewish population was expelled. The Germans established and operated a Nazi prison in the city, and multiple forced labour camps within present-day city limits, including two camps solely for Poles (\"Polenlager\"), four camps solely for Jews, two subcamps (E734, E750) of the Stalag VIII-B/344 prisoner-of-war camp, and a subcamp of the Auschwitz concentration camp. Eventually, Katowice was captured by the Red Army in January 1945. Significant parts of the downtown and inner suburbs were demolished during the occupation. As a result, the authorities were able to preserve the central district in its prewar character.\nPostwar period.\nThe postwar period of Katowice was characterised by the time of heavy industry development in the Upper Silesian region, which helped the city in regaining its status as the most industrialised Polish city and a major administrative centre. As the city developed so briskly, the 1950s marked a significant increase in its population and an influx of migrants from the Eastern Borderlands, the so-called \"Kresy\". The city area began to quickly expand by incorporating the neighbouring communes and counties. However, the thriving industrial city also had a dark period in its short but meaningful history. Most notably, between 7 March 1953 and 10 December 1956, Katowice was called \"Stalinogr\u00f3d\" in honour of Joseph Stalin, leader of the Soviet Union. The change was brought upon by an issued decree of the State Council. The date of the alteration of the city name was neither a coincidence or accidental as it happened on the day of Stalin's death. In this way, the Polish United Workers' Party and the socialist authority wanted to pay tribute to the dictator. The new name never got accepted by the citizens and in 1956 the former Polish name was restored.\nThe following decades were more memorable in the history of Katowice. Regardless of its industrial significance, it started to become an important cultural and educational centre in Central and Eastern Europe. In 1968, the University of Silesia in Katowice, the largest and most valued college in the area, was founded. Simultaneously the construction of large housing estates began to evolve. Furthermore, many representative structures were erected at that time, including the Silesian Insurgents' Monument (1967) and Spodek (1971), which have become familiar landmarks and tourist sights. The 1960s and 1970s saw the evolution of modernist architecture and functionalism. Katowice eventually developed into one of the most modernist post-war cities of Poland.\nOne of the most dramatic events in the history of the city occurred on 16 December 1981. It was then that 9 protesters died (7 were shot dead; 2 died from injury complications) and another 21 were wounded in the pacification of Wujek Coal Mine. The Special Platoon of the Motorized Reserves of the Citizens' Militia (\"ZOMO\") was responsible for the brutal handling of strikers protesting against Wojciech Jaruzelski's declaration of martial law and the arrest of Solidarity trade union officials. On the 10th anniversary of the event, a memorial was unveiled by the President of Poland Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa.\nIn 1990, the first democratic local elections that took place marked a new period in the city's history. The economy of Katowice has been transforming from the heavy industry of steel and coal mines into \"one of the most attractive investment areas for modern economy branches in Central Europe\".\n21st century.\nIn 2008, Katowice was awarded the Europe Prize by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe for having made exceptional efforts to spread the ideal of European unity.\nThe city's efficient infrastructure, rapid progress in the overall development and an increase in office space has made Katowice a popular venue for conducting business. The Katowice Expo Centre (\"Katowickie Centrum Wystawiennicze\") organises trade fairs or exhibitions and attracts investors from all over the world. In 2018, the city was the host of the 24th Session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC COP24). In 2022, the city hosted the 11th edition of the World Urban Forum, the world's most important conference on sustainable urbanization and development of cities.\nGeography.\nKatowice encompasses an area of . The city is situated in the Silesian Highlands, about north of the Silesian Beskids (part of the Carpathian Mountains). K\u0142odnica and Rawa (tributaries of the Oder and the Vistula respectively) are the largest rivers in Katowice, and the border between catchment areas of Oder and Vistula goes through the city. With a minimal elevation of and median elevation of above sea level, Katowice has the highest elevation among large cities in Poland.\nClimate.\nKatowice has a temperate, ocean-moderated humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: \"Dfb/Cfb\"). The average temperature is 8.2 \u00b0Celsius ( in January and up to in July). Yearly rainfall averages at . Characteristic weak winds blow at about from the southwest, through the Moravian Gate.\nNeighborhoods.\nKatowice has 22 officially recognized neighborhoods. \u015ar\u00f3dmie\u015bcie, Osiedle Paderewskiego-Muchowiec, Zawodzie and Koszutka form the dense central urban core where most cultural and educational institutions, businesses and administrative buildings are located.\nMost Northern and Eastern neighborhoods around the downtown core are more working-class and developed from worker's estates build around large industry such as coal mines, manufactures and steelworks. Each of these neighborhoods has its own dense commercial strip surrounded by mid-rise apartment buildings and some single-family homes. Szopienice, located between downtown Katowice and Mys\u0142owice, used to be a separate town until mid-1960s. Nikiszowiec, a former mine's town, has undergone strong gentrification in recent years, and emerged as a major tourist attraction in the region thanks to its unique architecture and art galleries.\nWestern and Southern neighborhoods (with the exception of Bryn\u00f3w-Za\u0142\u0119ska Ha\u0142da, which is a working-class neighborhood built around a coal mine) are more suburban in nature, concentrating the city's middle and upper middle classes. \nMetropolitan area.\nKatowice lies in the centre of the largest conurbation in Poland, one of the largest in the European Union, numbering about 2.7\u00a0million. The Katowice metropolitan area consists of about 40 adjacent cities and towns, the whole Katowice-Ostrava metropolitan area (mostly within the Upper Silesian Coal Basin) over 50 cities or towns and a population of 5,008,000. In 2006, Katowice and 14 adjacent cities united as the Metropolitan Association of Upper Silesia (predecessor to the current Metropolis GZM). Its population was 2 million and its area was . In 2006\u20132007 the union planned to unite these cities in one city under the name \"Silesia\", but this proved unsuccessful.\nThe Katowice conurbation comprises settlements which have evolved because of the mining of metal ores, coal and raw rock materials. The establishment of mining and heavy industry which have developed for the past centuries has resulted in the unique character of the cityscape; its typical aspects are the red brick housing estates constructed for the poorer working class, factory chimneys, manufacturing plants, power stations and quarries. The inhabitants of a large mining community like Katowice, and local administrations within the conurbation, which have only evolved due to mining, are a subject to overall decline after the liquidation of coal mines and factories. This is one of the reasons which led to the development of the service sector, including office spaces, shopping centres and tourism.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe Polish Statistical Office estimates Katowice's population to be 292,774 as of 2020,[ [update]] with a population density of . There were 139,274 males and 153,500 females. Age breakdown of people in Katowice is: 12.9% 0\u201314 years old, 13.7% 15\u201329 years old, 23.8% 30\u201344 years old, 19.5% 45\u201359 years old, 20.1% 60\u201374 years old, and 9.9% 75 years and older.\nKatowice is a centre of the Katowice-Ostrava metropolitan area, with a population of approx. 5.3 million. This metropolitan area extends into the neighboring Czechia, where the other centre is the city of Ostrava. 41 municipalities that constitute the core of the metropolitan area created the Metropolis GZM association, which has 2.3 million people as of 2019.[ [update]]\nHistorical population.\nKatowice's population grew very fast between 1845 and 1960, fueled by the expansion of heavy industry and administrative functions. In the 60s, 70s and 80s, the city grew by another 100,000 people, reaching a height of 368,621 in 1988. Since then, the decline of heavy industry, emigration, and suburbanization reversed the population development; Katowice lost approx. 75,000 people (20%) since the fall of communism in Poland.\nBefore World War II, Katowice was mainly inhabited by Poles and Germans. The 1905 Silesian demographic census has shown that Germans made up nearly 70\u201375% of the total population (including German Jews) and Poles constituted 25\u201330% of inhabitants of Katowice. After the plebiscite in Upper Silesia, Silesian uprisings and the incorporation of Katowice into Poland in 1922, and then the incorporation of several nearby villages and towns into the city, the number of inhabitants of Katowice increased significantly, but the number of Germans in Katowice fell to 12% in 1925 and to 6% in 1939 (most Germans left Poland, many ethnic Silesians who used to identify as Germans switched their identification to Poles, and areas with a Polish majority were incorporated). Thus, in 1939 the ethnic breakdown of the city was: 93% Poles, 6% Germans, and 1% Jews.\nAfter the German aggression against Poland in 1939, some Poles were displaced from Katowice and Germans were settled in their place. During the war, the Nazi occupiers committed severe crimes against the local Roma and Jewish communities, either killing them on the spot or transporting them to concentration camps such as Auschwitz for complete extermination. This led to a wartime population drop. In 1945, practically the entire German minority has either left fleeing the Red Army or was forced to leave after Poland regained control of the city, and Poles from Kresy (Eastern Borderlands of interwar Poland that were annexed by USSR after the war) and other parts of the country started to come to settle in the city. Katowice enjoyed a population boom after World War II, driven primarily by internal economic migration from less developed parts of the country.\nSince the late 1960s, Katowice and the surrounding area experiences low birth rates, which, paired with the decline of heavy industry and reduced job opportunities, caused the population of Katowice to start decreasing in the late 1980s. As of recent years, increased economic activity in the area has stopped outward migration but the negative natural change (more deaths than births) continues to fuel population decline.\nEthnic diversity.\nKatowice is one of the more diverse cities in Poland. In the 2021 census, 93.87% of inhabitants declared a Polish nationality while 19.38% declared a nationality other than Polish (in the Polish census, respondents are allowed to declare up to two nationalities or ethnicities). Indigenous Silesians were the largest minority, at 17.8%, followed by Germans (0.43%), Ukrainians (0.18%), the English (0.12%), Jews (0.07%) and Italians (0.07%).\nIn addition, Katowice is home to a large immigrant population that is largely unaccounted for in the official population data in Poland. According to the Polish Ministry of Development, Labor and Technology, there have been 20,527 foreigners (7% of official population figure) on a special worker permit for citizens of Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Russia, Serbia and Ukraine in Katowice in 2020, 19,003 of them from Ukraine. By the end of 2021, this number has increased to 26,990, with 23,207 of them from Ukraine. Additionally, as of \u00a02022,[ [update]] 11,568 refugees settled in Katowice since the start of the Russian invasion on Ukraine. By the December 2024, the number has increased to 11,894.\nSocioeconomics.\nAccording to the 2021 census, 32.3% of the population aged 13 and older had a college degree, 34.3% had a high school diploma or some college, 17.9% completed a vocational secondary school, 2.4% only completed a gimnazjum, 8.4% only completed a primary school while 2.1% did not complete primary school. In 2011, in the 25\u201334 age group, college graduates share is 44.9%, and an additional 31.8% has a high school degree. According to Eurostat data, Katowice and its surrounding Silesian region had one of the highest share of people who have attained at least an upper secondary level of education (more than 90%), and one of the lowest share of school dropouts in Europe (less than 5%).\nThere were 120,869 households in Katowice as of the 2021 census, a drop from 134,199 in the 2011 census. Average household size was 2.33, virtually unchanged from the 2.3 reported in the previous census. 32.4% households were single-person households, 31.2% had two people, 18.5% had three people, 11.5% had four people and 6.4% had five people or more. Compared to the 2011 census, the largest difference was an increase in households with 5 and more people (from 4.9%).\nAs of 2022, Katowice placed third in the country among cities with the highest average salaries, at PLN 8,017.49, behind Warsaw and Krak\u00f3w. Poverty rate places Katowice on average with other big cities in Poland, at 4.09% of inhabitants eligible for welfare benefits as of 2019.[ [update]]\nReligion.\nRoman Catholicism is the main religion in Katowice; as of the 2021[ [update]] Polish census, 60.52% (172,915 people) of Katowice residents declared to be Roman Catholic, representing a significant drop from the 2011 census when Roman Catholics were 82.43% of the population.\nNo other denomination had at least 1,000 followers as of the 2021 census. In the 2011 census, denominations with at least 1,000 worshippers included the Lutheran Church in Poland \u2013 0.43% (1,336 people) and Jehovah's Witnesses \u2013 0.42% (1,311 people). Other religions with presence and places of worship in the city include Judaism, Islam, and Buddhism, as well as other Protestant denominations.\nChristianity.\nKatowice is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese, with the suffragan bishoprics of Gliwice and Opole, and around 1,477,900 Catholics. The Cathedral of Christ the King, constructed between 1927 and 1955 in a classicist style, is the largest cathedral in Poland. There are 36 Catholic churches in Katowice (including two basilicas), as well as 18 monasteries. Katowice is also a seat of a diocesan Catholic seminary, as well as one of the Order of Friars Minor. Katowice Archdiocese owns several media companies headquartered in Katowice: \"Ksi\u0119garnia \u015bw. Jacka\", a Catholic publishing company, and \"Instytut Go\u015b\u0107 Media\", a multi-channeled media company that owns \"Radio eM\", a regional Catholic radio, and a few magazines. Go\u015b\u0107 Niedzielny, owned by \"Instytut Go\u015b\u0107 Media\" and published in Katowice, is currently the most-popular Catholic magazine in the country with approx. 120,000 copies sold weekly.\nKatowice is also the seat of a Lutheran Diocese which covers Upper Silesia, Lesser Poland and Subcarpathian region and has 12,934 adherents as of 2019.[ [update]] Lutherans have two churches in Katowice, including a cathedral, which is the oldest church built originally in Katowice, completed on 29 September 1858. Historically, Lutheran population in Katowice was mostly German, and with the expulsion of Germans from Poland after the Second World War, number of Lutherans dropped in Katowice.\nOther denominations with churches or praying houses in Katowice include Seventh Day Adventists, Baptists, Christ Church in Poland, Pentecostals and other evangelical groups.\nJudaism.\nJudaism has historically been present in Katowice since at least 1702. First synagogue, designed by a local architect Ignatz Gr\u00fcnfeld, was consecrated on 4 September 1862, while the Jewish cemetery was established in 1868. Dr. Jacob Cohn was the first rabbi of Katowice, appointed to this function on 6 January 1872 and holding it until 1920s. Zionism was strong in Katowice, and in 1884 the city was the place of the Katowice Conference, the first public Zionist meeting in history. On 12 September 1900, the Great Synagogue was opened.\nFollowing World War I and subsequent creation of the Polish state, most Katowice Jews, who identified with Germany, left the city and settled primarily in Bytom, a nearby city that was still part of Germany. They were partially replaced by Jews moving from the East, particularly the neighboring D\u0105browa Basin region that had a large Jewish population. In 1931, 60% of 5,716 Jews in Katowice were recent immigrants from other parts of Poland. On 1 September 1939, Poland was attacked by Nazi Germany, and Katowice, a border city, surrendered on 3 September. The Great Synagogue was burned by the German army the same day, and in the following months, Katowice Jews were deported to ghettos in D\u0105browa Basin (primarily Sosnowiec and B\u0119dzin) or directly to various concentration and death camps where most of them were murdered in the Holocaust. After the war, around 1,500 Jews were living in Katowice, but most of them left Poland and emigrated to the United States and other Western countries.\nCurrently, Katowice has one Qahal with approximately 200 members. It owns houses of prayer in Katowice (along with a kosher cafeteria) and nearby Gliwice, and the current rabbi is Yehoshua Ellis.\nOther religions.\nThere are two buddhist groups in Katowice: Kwan Um School of Zen, first registered in 1982, and the Diamond Road of Karma Kagyu line association. Jehovah's Witnesses maintain 13 houses of prayer and one Kingdom Hall in Katowice. Aside from Polish-language congregations, there is one for English speakers and one for Ukrainian speakers.\nArchitecture and urban design.\nLate 19th/early 20th century.\nUnlike most other large Polish cities, Katowice did not originate as a medieval town, therefore it does not have an old town with a street layout and architectural styles characteristic to cities founded on Magdeburg rights. Katowice's urban layout is a result of expansion and annexation of various towns, industrial worker estates, and villages.\nKatowice city centre has an axis design, along the main railway line, developed by an industrialist Friedrich Grundman in mid-19th century. Most of the city centre in Katowice developed in late 19th and early 20th century, when it was part of the Kingdom of Prussia and had a German-speaking majority. As a result, architectural styles of that era are similar to those in other Prussian cities such as Berlin or Wroc\u0142aw (then Breslau); primarily renaissance revival and baroque revival, with some buildings in gothic revival, romanesque revival, and art nouveau styles.\nInterwar architecture.\nIn 1922, Katowice and the eastern portion of Upper Silesia were reintegrated with reborn Poland, and an autonomous Silesian Voivodeship was established, with Katowice as its capital. This event has marked the beginning of a period of unprecedented architectural development in the city. Since most traditional styles, especially gothic and gothic revival, were perceived as connected to imperial Germany by the new Polish authorities, all new development was to be built in, at first in the neoclassical, and later in functionalist/Bauhaus style. The city, which needed to build administrative buildings for the new authorities and housing for people working in regional administration, began expansion southward creating one of the largest complexes of modern architecture in Poland, comparable to Warsaw and Gdynia (newly built port on the Baltic Sea) only.\nThe modernist district is centered around the monumental Silesian Parliament building (1923\u20131929), which architecture is mostly neoclassical, albeit with early modernist influences. During World War II, the building became headquarters of the Reichsgau Oberschlesien and part of the interior was redesigned by Albert Speer, Hitler's favorite architect, to resemble the interior of the Reich Chancellery. The nearby Cathedral of Christ the King (1927\u20131955, with dome lowered by 34 meters compared to original design) is also neoclassical but with an ascetic, modernist-inspired interior (including a tabernacle and a golden mosaic funded by future pope, Joseph Ratzinger). Other buildings, designed in mid-to-late 1920s and 1930s, are mostly modernist or functionalist. A symbol of the city in the interwar period, Drapacz Chmur (literally: \"The Skyscraper\"), was the first skyscraper built in Poland after World War I, and the first building in the country to be based on a steel frame.\nPost-war architecture.\nAfter World War II, Katowice again expected a period of rapid growth, particularly under the regional leadership of Marshall Jerzy Zi\u0119tek. Pa\u0142ac M\u0142odzie\u017cy (\"Youth Palace\") became the first major new building completed in Katowice after the war, erected in the socrealist style with elements of late modernism in 1949\u20131951. The largest development of the 1950s in Katowice was the expansion of the Koszutka neighborhood, also in the socialist realist style, in early 1950s.\nFollowing the death of Stalin in 1956, and the end of socrealism, Jerzy Zi\u0119tek and city authorities commissioned a group of young architects and urbanists to create a project of the new urban design of Katowice. The collective, named \"Miastoprojekt Katowice\", came up with a design heavily influenced by Le Corbusier's ideas. The project was centered around a grand avenue (current \"Aleja Korfantego\") surrounded by simple, modern blocks and monuments, scattered in distance to each other according to modernist ideals of preserving space and light for the masses. The most important buildings from that time include:\nContemporary architecture.\nFollowing the collapse of communism in Poland and other Eastern Bloc countries, and the centrally-planned economy with it, Poland's economy suffered a downturn, and construction slowed down. One of the most significant buildings of the 1990s was the new branch of the Silesian Library, in postmodernism style.\nThe situation changed in the early aughts, when several new notable developments were completed:\nAnother wave of architectural revival came after Poland joined the European Union in 2004. European cohesion funds, along with private capital investment, flew into the city resulting in a number of architecturally acclaimed buildings and complexes, including:\nTourist attractions.\nOther:\nEconomy.\nKatowice has been classified as a Gamma \u2013 global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network and is considered as an emerging metropolis. Katowice's metropolitan area is the 16th most economically powerful urban area in the European Union by GDP, with an output amounting to $114.5\u00a0billion. The city is one of the major industrial, commerce and financial hubs of Poland and has successfully transformed its economy from heavy industry-based to knowledge-based one.\nEmployment and incomes.\nAs of August 2024, 252,841 people are employed in Katowice, which makes the city the 7th largest job market in Poland, slightly ahead of Gda\u0144sk. Main sectors include professional services (including the IT sector and finance) at 15.8%, retail (13.7%), and government (12.6%). Unemployment rate is extremely low at 1%, as of June 2024.\nMedian monthly income for residents of Katowice stood at PLN 7,220.00 while median monthly income for those employed in Katowice was higher at PLN 8,053.30 as of August 2024, both above the country's median of PLN 6,697.52.\nBusiness and commerce.\nKatowice is a large business, convention and trade fair centre. As of 2012, 44,050 businesses were registered in Katowice. 13 of them are traded on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, with ING Bank \u015al\u0105ski being the largest one by far, while 11 are traded on the NewConnect floor. \nLargest private corporations headquartered in Katowice include Polska Grupa G\u00f3rnicza (coal mining and energy), Farmacol (pharmaceuticals), Famur (mining equipment manufacturing), Mistal (steel products manufacturing), Emiternet (renewable energy systems). Major international corporations with regional headquarters in Katowice include IBM, Unilever, PwC, Deloitte, Groupon, Eurofins, Capgemini, Sopra Steria, Accenture, Fujitsu, Citibank, HSBC, KPMG, RSM, Baker Tilly, and others.\nKatowice is also the seat of Katowice Special Economic Zone (Katowicka Specjalna Strefa Ekonomiczna).\nHeavy industry and manufacturing.\nSince its creation, Katowice's development was tightly connected to heavy industry, especially coal mining, steelworks and machine production. In 1931, 49.5% of inhabitants worked in industry, and 12.5% in coal mining alone. In 1989 industry accounted for 36% of all jobs in the city (112,000 employees). As of 2018, 34,294 people worked in industry in Katowice, 20.4% of total, below the national average.\nThe first reported coal mine in Katowice (\"Murcki\" coal mine) was established in 1740, and in 1769 construction on \"Emanuelssegen\" mine started. As the demand for coal kept rising in the Kingdom of Prussia, further mines were opened: \"Beata\" (1801), \"Ferdinand\" (1823), \"Kleofas\" (1845). Later in 19th and early 20th century additional mines were opened: \"Katowice\", \"Wujek\", \"Eminenz\" (later renamed \"Gottwald\" and merged with \"Kleofas\"), \"Wieczorek\", \"Bo\u017ce Dary\", \"Staszic\" and renewed \"Murcki\". Currently only one (\"Murcki-Staszic\") remains in operation. Katowice is also the seat of , the largest coal mining corporation in Europe. Metallurgy was another important part of Katowice's economy. In 1863 a dozen zinc metallurgy facilities were reported in Katowice, with \"Wilhelmina\" (founded in 1834) being the largest. In early 1900s, \"Wilhelmina\" (later renamed \"Huta Metali Niezale\u017cnych Szopienice\") was enlarged and became the largest Silesian producer of non-ferrous metals and world's largest producer of cadmium. Two major steelworks existed in the city: \"Huta Baildon\", established in 1823 by the Scottish engineer and industrialist John Baildon (declared bankruptcy in 2001), and \"Huta Ferrum\", established in 1874 and operating to this date in limited capacity.\nCulture.\nVibrant and progressive artistic communities, particularly around musical arts, make Katowice one of the leading cultural spots in Poland. Since mid-2000s, Katowice has established a strategy to redevelop the post-industrial areas using culture \u2013 the pinnacle of which was a massive development on the site of a former coal mine known as (the \"Zone of Culture\"), where numerous cultural and convention institutions are located.\nPerforming arts.\nKatowice's status as the UNESCO City of Music, designated when Katowice joined UNESCO Creative Cities Network in 2015, comes from a long and rich history of musical arts. Katowice is the seat of an internationally renowned Karol Szymanowski Academy of Music, whose faculty and graduates created the nationally important informal group called the Silesian school of composers. Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra has been located in Katowice since 1945 and has gotten a new internationally acclaimed concert hall in 2014, built on a site of a former coal mine near Katowice's city center. The Silesian Philharmonic also has its seat in Katowice. The city is a venue for numerous classical concerts and festivals, such as: the International Festival of Young Music Competition Laureates, Grzegorz Fitelberg International Competition for Conductors, Chamber Music Festival, Ars Cameralis Festival and Katowice's opera, operettas and most of all ballet.\nThere are currently 6 theater buildings in Katowice, and some theater groups without a permanent location. Teatr \u015al\u0105ski is the oldest still-functioning theater in Katowice, first opened for audience in 1907 and located on the main square. It was the first theater to give plays in Silesian dialect of Polish. Every first Monday of the month, the Silesian Opera singers from nearby Bytom give a performance there, as Katowice does not have an opera house of its own. Teatr Ateneum is an important puppetry theater, while Teatr Korez was one of the first non-public theaters in post-war Poland.\nKatowice is home to many nationally and internationally renowned popular music festivals. Rawa Blues, named after a stream that passes through Katowice's city center, is one of the largest blues festivals in Europe. Electronic music's Mayday Festival takes place every year in early November and is a sister event to its namesake in Dortmund. OFF Festival, dedicated to alternative music, moved to Katowice in 2010 and has been held every August. Tauron Nowa Muzyka festival, oriented more towards dance and techno has been named one of the major European festivals to attend. Other music festivals, such as the Silesian Jazz Festival, KatoHej (dedicated to chants and touristic music), and Gardens of Sound, are also organized. In 2019, 475,806 people attended various big cultural events such as concerts and festivals, which gave the city the third place in Poland, behind Warsaw and Krak\u00f3w. Nearby Chorz\u00f3w, with the Silesian Stadium right across the street from Katowice, gathered another 319,783 attendees.\nMuseums and art galleries.\nThe Silesian Museum is the largest and most-important museum in Katowice. It originally opened in 1929, and its radically modern, Bauhaus-style new building was demolished immediately after the Nazis seized Katowice in 1939, considering it too degenerate and too Polish. The museum has been placed in temporary buildings with its collections dispersed until 2015, when a new, mostly underground building has been constructed in the Zone of Culture. The museum exhibits works by famous and renowned Polish artists like J\u00f3zef Che\u0142mo\u0144ski, Artur Grottger, Tadeusz Makowski, Jacek Malczewski, Jan Matejko, J\u00f3zef Mehoffer and Stanis\u0142aw Wyspia\u0144ski.

The well-developed network supports over 200,000 cars registered in Katowice, and 49 percent of commuters that drive alone, a high share compared to other major cities in Poland. Several freeways in Katowice are among the busiest in Poland: expressway S86 between Sosnowiec and Katowice's city center and highway A4 between Murckowska and Miko\u0142owska interchanges both see over 100,000 cars passing each day.\nKatowice has a ring around its city center, consisting of highway A4, Murckowska freeway, Drogowa Trasa \u015arednicowa (a freeway-style road connecting downtowns of cities in the Katowice urban area) that partly goes in a tunnel underground and Boche\u0144skiego road. Many of the roads and freeways in Katowice expand radially from the city center and replaced old local roads.\nMain roads.\nEuropean route E40 passes through Katowice as highway A4. It enters the city from Chorz\u00f3w and continues eastward, with three lanes in each direction on the main road and two to three lanes in parallel access roads. It meets Boche\u0144skiego road and continues towards Miko\u0142owska interchange, which is one of the only combination interchanges in Poland and the main exit towards the city center. After that interchange, the highway loses its access roads due to lack of space in the dense urban area and continues east with four lanes in each direction. Access roads appear again (only on the south side, though) after around 500 meters and there is an exit towards Francuska Street. After another 1.5 kilometer, access roads appear again on the north side, too, and there is a tight exit towards Pu\u0142askiego Street. The highway then runs into Murckowska interchange, before exiting the city.\nNational road 79 (DK79) enters Katowice from Chorz\u00f3w and separates the Silesian Park and Osiedle Tysi\u0105clecia in Katowice. It then merges with Drogowa Trasa \u015arednicowa (DT\u015a) at the junction with Boche\u0144skiego road and Z\u0142ota Street.

In the Bryn\u00f3w neighborhood, Ko\u015bciuszki Street continues towards Katowice's city center while NR 81 turns east, to run through the forest towards the interchange with DK86.\nNational road 86 (DK86) enters Katowice from Sosnowiec as expressway S86 up until Ro\u017adzie\u0144skiego interchange where it meets DK79 and loses its expressway status. It then continues south as Murckowska freeway east of the city center. It meets highway A4 and then passes by Giszowiec neighborhood and continues through the woods southward, with exits towards Murcki neighborhood (from which it gets its name) and Kostuchna. It bypasses Murcki from the east and continues south towards Tychy.\nTempo 30 Zone.\nIn 2015, Katowice designated most of its city center as a zone, in an effort to curb traffic fatalities and crashes. Within 3 years of operation, the number of accidents dropped by 41 percent, including 37 percent drop in accidents involving pedestrians and cyclists. The accidents are also less severe: there was a 55 percent drop in injured pedestrians and cyclists.\nAirports.\nLocated approximately north of the city center, Katowice Airport is the main airport serving Katowice.

Katowice is also the second-largest cargo airport, after Warsaw Chopin. The airport is accessed through a metropolitan express bus line, running every 30 minutes between 4am and 9:30pm and every hour at night. A new train station at the airport is under construction, scheduled to be operational in 2023.\nKatowice is also within an hour drive from Krak\u00f3w Airport, which offers additional destinations and airlines such as Amsterdam (KLM), Paris (Air France), Helsinki (Finnair), Chicago and Newark (LOT Polish Airlines), Copenhagen and Stockholm (SAS) and Zurich (Swiss). The airport can be accessed through scheduled buses leaving from Katowice bus station every 30\u201360 minutes.\nSports.\nKatowice has a long sporting tradition and hosted the final of EuroBasket 2009 and 1975 European Athletics Indoor Championships, 1975 European Amateur Boxing Championships, 1976 World Ice Hockey Championships, 1957, 1985 European Weightlifting Championships, 1974, 1982 World Wrestling Championships, 1991 World Amateur Bodybuilding Championships, 2011 Women's European Union Amateur Boxing Championships, 2014 FIVB Men's World Championship and others.\nThe Stadion \u015al\u0105ski is between Chorz\u00f3w and Katowice.

{"id": "42194", "revid": "44474606", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42194", "title": "Vantaa", "text": "City in Uusimaa, Finland\nVantaa (; , ) is a city in Finland. It is located to the north of the capital, Helsinki, in southern Uusimaa. The population of Vantaa is approximately . It is the most populous municipality in Finland. Vantaa is part of the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, which has approximately \u00a0million inhabitants.\nThe administrative centre of Vantaa is located in the Tikkurila district. Vantaa lies in Southern Finland and shares borders with Helsinki, the Finnish capital, to the south, Espoo to the southwest, Nurmij\u00e4rvi to the northwest, Kerava and Tuusula to the north, and Sipoo to the east. The city covers a total area of , of which is water.\nVantaa's significant attractions include the Vantaa River (\"Vantaanjoki\"), which runs through the city before flowing into the Gulf of Finland. The Helsinki Airport, situated in Vantaa, serves as the largest airport in Finland and the primary airline hub for the Helsinki metropolitan area. Companies headquartered in Vantaa comprise Finnair, Finavia, R-kioski, Tikkurila Oyj, Veikkaus, and Mets\u00e4hallitus. Additionally, Vantaa is home to Heureka, a science center.\nVantaa is a bilingual municipality with Finnish and Swedish as its official languages. The population consists of Finnish speakers, Swedish speakers (the lowest percentage out of any bilingual municipality in Finland), and speakers of other languages, which is well above the national average. According to the 2025 disturbance index used by the Finnish Police, Vantaa is currently the most dangerous city in Finland, and Myyrm\u00e4ki its most dangerous district.\nHistory.\nVantaa has a rich history that dates back to the Stone Age. The area was inhabited by Tavastians and Finns proper until the so-called second crusade to Finland and Swedish colonisation of the area.\nAncient history.\nRemains of an ancient rectangular dwelling dating to 6700 to 6500 BCE have been discovered in Brunaberg in Vantaa. At the time, the dwelling was located at the seashore near the mouth of the Keravanjoki river. The dwelling had been used for decades, apparently mostly in wintertime. A graveyard-like dwelling dating to the Mesolithic has been discovered in J\u00f6nsas, which was located at the mouth of a seaside bay at the time. In the Stone Age, people in Vantaa sought their food mostly from the sea. Seals were an important quarry, but remains of harbour porpoises have also been found at the numerous Neolithic dwelling sites at Jokiniemi. Remains of permanent dwellings found from Stenkulla in Hakkila date from the same period.\nThere are considerably many findings from the Comb Ceramic culture in Vantaa. Many ancient clay figures representing humans have been found in Jokiniemi in Vantaa. They have been estimated to be of various ages from 5300 to 5500 years old. During the typical Comb Ceramic time, large amounts of flint were brought to Finland from the south and southeast, which was made into blades and points, as well as amber. The Comb Ceramic era humans also knew how to use bows and arrows as weapons.\nIron Age history in Vantaa is not very well known, but the entire Uusimaa area was still a sparsely populated backland of Tavastia at the end of the Iron Age. The most researched Iron Age dwelling in Vantaa is located at the same site as the earlier Stone Age dwellings of J\u00f6nsas and Palmu. Remains of Morby ceramics have been discovered at these sites, and iron slag has also been discovered in J\u00f6nsas. Remains of fireplaces dating to the Iron Age have also been researched in J\u00f6nsas. Remains of dwellings dating to the 10th century have been discovered in Gubbacka in L\u00e4nsisalmi as well as remains of smithies from the 12th and 13th centuries.\nInformation about ancient villages located in the Vantaa area can be found from concentration of soil visible in palynological analysis as well as retroactive reasoning based on nomenclature and historical documents. According to historian Saulo Kepsu, Finnish population has spread from Tavastia to the Helsinki and Vantaa area in the 11th to 14th centuries, possibly even earlier. The Tavastians had fishing places and other pleasure grounds in the area.\nSwedish rule.\nPrior to the name \"Vantaa\" being taken into use in 1974, the area was known as \"Helsingin pit\u00e4j\u00e4\" (; \"Socken of Helsinki\"). The rapids of river Vantaa were known as \"Helsingfors\", from which the current Swedish name of Helsinki derives. Early settlement in Vantaa was centered around the river, in Helsingin pit\u00e4j\u00e4n kirkonkyl\u00e4 (\"Helsinki Parish Village\"), and from it the city's current coat of arms derived its imagery.\nThe Swedish colonisation in Vantaa started in connection with the colonisation in the rest of Uusimaa in the late 13th century after the Second Swedish Crusade. The Swedes called the area \"Ny land\" (\"new land\"). There was permanent settlement in the area of the branching point of the rivers in the 14th century.\nThe history of \"Helsingin pit\u00e4j\u00e4\" stretches at least to the 14th century. For a long time it was thought that the earliest record of the area was as \"Helsinge\" in 1351 when king Magnus IV of Sweden granted salmon fishing rights on the river \"Helsingaa\" (now known as the river Vantaa) to the Estonian Padise Abbey. However, according to current knowledge, the first mention of Vantaa was in a document given by king Magnus IV in V\u00e4ster\u00e5s on 14 September 1331, describing episcopal tithes, requiring a pound of butter for the bishop from every citizen of age 7 years or older.\nSince the 14th century, the road between Turku and Vyborg, King's Road, has run through Vantaa. The road brought significant attention to the city, and its location on the salmon rich river led to a permanent population.\nThe river \"Helsingaa\" soon gave its name to the entire area, and also inspired the coat of arms of Vantaa. The Helsinki socken was born from the 1370s to the 1390s, and the Church of St. Lawrence was built there in 1460. The church was located in a transport hub near the rivers of Vantaa and Kerava. Many roads also ran through the clerical centre: the King's Road from Turku to Vyborg and the H\u00e4me road to the H\u00e4me Castle and to the coast in the south. The first vicar in \"Helsingin pit\u00e4j\u00e4\" was mentioned in 1395. \"Helsingin pit\u00e4j\u00e4\" is seen as have established itself as a clerical and administrative parish in the 15th century, and the first mention of a church dedicated to Saint Lawrence in the area is from 1401. A local \"fr\u00e4lse\" family donated a land worth one \"skattmark\" from Rekola to the church of St. Lawrence. The name \"Helsinge\" was first mentioned in 1428. In the same year, fishing rights in the area were moved over to the Archdiocese of Turku, which helped the construction of a stone church to replace the old wooden one.\nJustice in \"Helsingin pit\u00e4j\u00e4\" was the responsibility of its own district court. It is known that the parish had its own district court in the 16th century. The court could be held by deputies hired by high-ranking judges, so-called lawreaders. The use of lawreaders was common from the late 16th century to the 1680s.\nBecause of its poor location, Porvoo could not compete with the Hanseatic merchants in Tallinn, so in 1550 king Gustav Vasa decided to found the city of Helsinki at the site of \"Helsingin pit\u00e4j\u00e4\" at the mouth of the Helsingaa river. \"Helsingin pit\u00e4j\u00e4\" had already developed into a significant centre of marine trade in Uusimaa in the 1530s. However, the Vanhakaupunki area in Helsinki never became the city centre Gustav Vasa wanted during his lifetime.\nIn 1570, the 25-year Russian war also affected life in \"Helsingin pit\u00e4j\u00e4\". Increased stress, additional military tax and enemy attacks had their toll on the population and often led to farmsteads being deserted. In 1577 there were 51 farmsteads burned and raided by the enemy. Serving food to and accommodating the military departments was the responsibility of police chief Olof M\u00e5rtensson, who lived at the Malmi horsestead. The largest department served by the police chief consisted of 40 horsemen from the Uppland unit in January 1576. As well as the Malmi horsestead, \"Helsingin pit\u00e4j\u00e4\" was also home to the horsesteads of Pukinm\u00e4ki, Herttoniemi, Haltiala, Kirkonkyl\u00e4, Meilby, Kulosaari and Heickby.\nAfter the Treaty of Stolbovo, the Diet of Helsinki granted the rights of a staple town to Helsinki for foreign trade in 1617. The wars against Poland and Germany in the 1620s led to many large manors for the nobility being built in \"Helsingin pit\u00e4j\u00e4\" to support the cavalry, including Westerkulla and Hakunila. In autumn 1640, it was decided to move Helsinki from the Vanhakaupunki area to its current location at Vironniemi. The village of T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6 was annexed from \"Helsingin pit\u00e4j\u00e4\" to Helsinki proper in 1644, and in 1652 the parish congregation lost its independent status, and in order to support the economy of the Helsinki congregation, the entire church parish of Helsinki was annexed to the city congregation of Helsinki.\nThe Great Famine of 1695\u20131697 also had its toll on \"Helsingin pit\u00e4j\u00e4\". Successive years of crop loss caused famine and mortality was high. As well as the peasants, the famine also affected servants of the crown, both the noble and the common estates, and the bourgeoisie.\nDuring the Great Wrath Russian troops invaded \"Helsingin pit\u00e4j\u00e4\" in 1713. Some of the inhabitants fled to the mother country of Sweden or into nearby forests, some fought back against the invaders. As the invasion grew long, circumstances slowly settled and the Treaty of Nystad was made in autumn 1721. A second, shorter invasion, known as the Lesser Wrath, happened from 1742 to 1743.\nCircumstances in \"Helsingin pit\u00e4j\u00e4\" started improving in the 1720s, as it became one of the most important centres of early industry in Finland. Water-powered sawmills were built in the area, forming a significant concentration of export industry at the time. This export was directed both to central Europe and also far way to the Mediterranean Sea in the late 18th century. A significant export target for \"Helsingin pit\u00e4j\u00e4\" was located just near its coast: the construction of the Sveaborg fortress, started in 1748, required large amounts of workforce and agricultural and industrial products such as foodstuffs, wood, brick and lime.\n\"Helsingin pit\u00e4j\u00e4\" was a Swedish-speaking area. From the middle 18th century to the early 19th century, only about a tenth of the population of the parish spoke Finnish.\nGrand Duchy of Finland under Russian rule.\nOre deposits in \"Helsingin pit\u00e4j\u00e4\" had been discovered in the 1700s, but weren't utilized until Finland transferred to Russian control in the early 1800s. Ore extraction and processing lead to rapid industrialization in the area, with communities forming around locations like Tikkurila and Kerava. The industrial community in Tikkurila included an expeller pressing plant, which currently operates in the area as the paint manufacturer Tikkurila Oyj.\nThe capital of autonomous Finland was moved from Turku to Helsinki in the early 1800s and \"Helsingin pit\u00e4j\u00e4\" fell behind the growing population development of Helsinki proper. \"Helsingin pit\u00e4j\u00e4\" gained municipality rights in 1865 because of the first municipal law enacted in Finland, after which it was named \"Helsingin maalaiskunta/Helsinge kommun\" (\"Rural Municipality of Helsinki\"). In 1805 \"Helsingin pit\u00e4j\u00e4\" had 4840 inhabitants, Sveaborg had 4606 and Helsinki had 4337. After six decades \"Helsingin pit\u00e4j\u00e4\" had about 7000 inhabitants while Helsinki already had 23,000.\nThe parish assembly meeting in 1823 established the general order, which specified crimes and punishments they resulted in. One of the reasons the general order was made was the increase of rootless vagabonds in the society. The parish assembly meeting and participation of citizens in keeping up the order was needed, because the state officials failed to keep the poor-mannered part of the people under control. Crimes not resulting in a court session were handled in the parish assembly meeting by announcement from the fief holder.\nInterest towards a people's education increased in the early 19th century, when basic education still mostly depended on home tuition. By a suggestion from vicar Erik Crohns, a school was founded in Kirkonkyl\u00e4 in 1825 and a school master was hired.\nThe year 1865 is considered a significant year in the history of Vantaa, as municipal rule in Finland was established in that year and \"Helsingin pit\u00e4j\u00e4\" became \"Helsingin maalaiskunta\", the rural municipality of Helsinki. This also led to the congregation regaining its position as an independent vicar area. The railway centre of Malmi became the administrative centre of the rural municipality.\nIn 1862, the railway between Helsinki and H\u00e4meenlinna was constructed, and one of its seven stations was built in Tikkurila, on its intersection with King's Road. The Swedish architect Carl Albert Edelfelt designed a Renaissance Revival styled station building, which is the oldest extant station building in Finland and (as of 1978) has been adapted into the Vantaa City Museum. The old station building in Tikkurila is the only brick station building in Finland preserved in its original state. The building was designed by the provincial architect of the H\u00e4me Province, Carl Albert Edelfelt (1818-1869). The railway brought industry and induced population growth.\nThe Finnish famine of 1866\u20131868 decreased the population of Vantaa by 1300 people, and population growth was very slow for a whole decade. Only in the late 1870s Vantaa regained its population from 1865. The elementary school in Kirkonkyl\u00e4 was founded on 15 September 1869, four years later than originally planned. There were two teachers, one for boys and one for girls.\nFour important roads passed through \"Helsingin pit\u00e4j\u00e4\" in the late 19th century: H\u00e4meentie, the King's Road, Nurmij\u00e4rventie and Porvoontie. To the north of Kirkonkyl\u00e4, H\u00e4meentie leading north crossed the King's Road. The King's Road connected Turku with Vyborg and Saint Petersburg. The King's Road, leading northwest, started from Helsinki as an extension of L\u00e4ntinen Viertotie (now known as Mannerheimintie). Porvoontie connected H\u00e4meentie and the King's Road separating from H\u00e4meentie between Viikki and Malminkyl\u00e4 and connecting to the King's Road in eastern Hakkila.\nThe largest industrial facility in \"Helsingin maalaiskunta\" in the late 19th century was the Arabia porcelain factory. Its production value was greater than that of all the other factories in the municipality put together. The factory was active in the village of Koskela, to the north of Helsinki, and was named after the villa Arabia previously located at the site of the factory.\nThe growing city of Helsinki needed large amounts of building materials, brought from Uusimaa and Tavastia. Brick factories in \"Helsingin maalaiskunta\" were located in Tikkurila, Lauttasaari and Kulosaari.\nA brewery founded by J. K. Kr\u00f6ckell was active in Pit\u00e4j\u00e4nm\u00e4ki, producing several styles of beer, sparkling wine, lemon-flavoured mead and a type of alcohol-free juice called Sorbus. The brewery horses carried malt products both to Helsinki and to the nearby railway station, continuing all the way to Tampere. The Pit\u00e4j\u00e4nm\u00e4ki brewery remained in action until 1914.\nIn 1899, an edict about tightly populated communities came into force in Finland. During the next couple of decades, almost twenty tightly populated communities were founded in the area of \"Helsingin maalaiskunta\". Of these, Huopalahti separated into its own municipality in 1920, Oulunkyl\u00e4 in 1921 and Kulosaari in 1922. With the exception of Tikkurila, all these communities were discontinued in early 1946 as they were annexed to the city of Helsinki. The tightly populated community of Tikkurila was discontinued together with the rest of the tightly populated communities in Finland in early 1956.\n20th century to today.\nElectricity started replacing steam as an industrial power source in \"Helsingin maalaiskunta\" before World War I. The power station \"Oy Malmin S\u00e4hk\u00f6laitos Ab\" was founded in 1910, and another power station was founded in Oulunkyl\u00e4 in the following year. Malmin s\u00e4hk\u00f6laitos, which had reached a central position, bought a lot from Tapanila for its new power plant. Construction of the power plant and distribution grid, led by Gottfried Str\u00f6mberg, was finished by the end of the year 1910.\nThe Helsinki-Malmi Airport was built at Tattarinsuo in the Malmi area of \"Helsingin maalaiskunta\" in 1936. The soil in the area was very watery and converting it to an airfield was difficult. The airport was taken into use in December 1936. Before this, air traffic in Helsinki had been served by the Santahamina Airport in Santahamina, which was also part of \"Helsingin maalaiskunta\" at the time.\nDuring the great annexation of 1946 the municipalities of Huopalahti, Oulunkyl\u00e4 and Kulosaari as well as about a third of the area of \"Helsingin maalaiskunta\" were annexed to the city of Helsinki. The rural municipality lost two thirds of its population, including Malmi and Pit\u00e4j\u00e4nm\u00e4ki. In 1954 some of the areas of Korso in Tuusula and Kerava were annexed to the rural municipality of Helsinki, as well as a small part of Tuusula in 1959. Vuosaari was annexed to Helsinki in 1966.\nThe population development of \"Helsingin maalaiskunta\" grew rapidly after World War II. Tikkurila became the new municipal centre in the 1950s. New residential areas consisting mainly of detached houses developed among the main roads and new suburban centres developed along the railways running through the area, such as Rekola, Korso and Koivukyl\u00e4.\nIn 1952, the new international airport of Helsinki opened in \"Helsingin maalaiskunta\" for the 1952 Summer Olympics, leading to the rural municipality becoming an important transport hub. The new airport split the municipality in half and brought large amounts of traffic and industry to its surroundings. The airport has become a significant part of the cityscape of Vantaa, and even today Vantaa is known abroad as an aviation city.\nBecause of World War II, many new urban areas had been born in Vantaa already in the 1940s, populated mainly by evacuees from Finnish Karelia and frontline soldiers, as well as Helsinkians seeking a less densely populated area to live in. The first apartment building groups were built in Tikkurila, Satom\u00e4ki and Vaarala in the 1950s, after which rural flight sped up construction of apartment buildings. In the record year 1970, the population of Vantaa grew by ten thousand people.\nThe Keimola Motor Stadium was built in 1966 along Finnish National Road 3, opposite the residential area of Kivist\u00f6, and remained in operation until 1978. Construction of the new Keimolanm\u00e4ki residential area in place of the former race track started in the 2010s.\nIn the early 20th century, the majority of the population of \"Helsingin maalaiskunta\" was Swedish-speaking. Afterwards, the rapid increase in the population has brought much more primarily Finnish-speaking population to the city, and today only 3.1 percent of the population in Vantaa are Swedish-speaking.\nThe roads in Finland were widened in the 1960s and 1970s, and the Ring III beltway was built to connect five national roads with each other. Myyrm\u00e4ki became a second centre in the area after the construction of the Martinlaakso railway, which also sped up development in southwestern Vantaa. New residential suburbs were born along the main railway in the 1960s to 1980s, sped up by rural flight. Areas left outside the main traffic connections, such as Seutula in the west and Sotunki in the east, were left mainly unbuilt and rural-oriented.\nIn 1972, the municipality was renamed \"Vantaa\" () and promoted to a kauppala (market town) (i.e. \"Vantaan kauppala/Vanda k\u00f6ping\"). In 1974, the town got full city rights as \"Vantaan kaupunki/Vanda stad\" or \"City of Vantaa\". The name \"Vantaa\" comes from the river Vantaa running through the city, along which settlement in the Vantaa area was originally centred. The 650th anniversary of Vantaa was celebrated in 2001.\nThe city grew rapidly starting from 1960s and a railway line was built to the western side of the city in 1970s.\nSince the days of the rural municipality, Vantaa has rapidly developed to its current form because of rural flight and good traffic connections. Like the neighbouring city of Espoo, Vantaa has many suburban commuter towns and lacks a specific city centre. The Helsinki Airport, the busiest airport in Finland by far, is located in central Vantaa.\nIn 2015, an extension to the existing railway line, the Ring Rail Line opened, providing service to the airport and new residential and working districts. Along the ring road, new residential were constructed. The largest of these developments is the Kivist\u00f6 suburb followed by the residential districts of Leinel\u00e4 and Aviapolis. The Ring Rail Line connects the Vantaankoski railway to the Finnish Main Line via the Helsinki Airport at Hiekkaharju.\nThe annual Beer floating summer event started in Vantaa in 1997. On 11 October 2002, an explosion took place in the Myyrmanni shopping centre in Myyrm\u00e4ki. Negotiations to resolve the Aceh conflict, led by former President of Finland Martti Ahtisaari, were held in the K\u00f6ningstedt Manor in Vantaa in early 2005.\nTo connect the municipality on the west\u2013east, a new tramway is planned to open in 2030. This tramway will run from the Helsinki-Vantaa airport through districts of Pakkala, Aviapolis and Koivuhaka to the administrative centre of Tikkurila and further onward to Hakkila and L\u00e4nsim\u00e4ki in the east. The tram will also provide a link to the Helsinki metro at Mellunm\u00e4ki station. This tramline will be the first tram in Vantaa.\nHistory and etymology of nomenclature.\nColonists arriving from Sweden in the 14th century settled in the area what is now Vantaa and named the river in the area as \"Helsing\u00e5\" or \"Helsingaa\". The etymology of this name is not known for sure, but according to an old tradition it probably comes from colonists who originally arrived at the H\u00e4lsingland area in Sweden.\nThe same river has also been known as the river Vantaa (\"Vanda \u00e5\" in Swedish). Unlike the name \"Helsingaa\", the name Vantaa comes from the Finnish-speaking Tavastian inhabitants upstream of the river. There is a village named Vantaa near the source of the river, at the area which now belongs to the city of Riihim\u00e4ki. According to a theory, the name comes from the Finnish words \"vanan taka\", where \"vana\" means a riverbed and so Vantaa (possibly originally spelled \"Vanantaa\") means a place behind a riverbed. Only later did the name also came to use also downstream and replace the old name \"Helsingaa\".\nThe Vanhankaupunginkoski rapids at the mouth of the river Vantaa were originally known as \"Helsinge fors\" (\"Helsinki rapids\"), which also gave the name \"Helsingfors\" to the city founded along the rapids.\nThe Vantaa blast furnace founded at the shore of the Vantaankoski rapids in 1837 gave the name \"Vantaa\" to its entire environment.\nBy the new municipal law in 1865 the Finnish name of the municipality became \"Helsingin maalaiskunta\" (\"the rural municipality of Helsinki\"), when the concept of sockens in Finland was discontinued. The Swedish name remained as \"Helsinge\", in contrast to \"Helsingfors\", the Swedish name for Helsinki proper. When \"Helsingin maalaiskunta\" became a market town in 1972, proposed new names included \"Helsingin kauppala\", \"Helsinginjoen kauppala\" and \"Vantaanjoen kauppala\". The accepted name was \"Vantaan kauppala\" after the river Vantaa. Two years later Vantaa received city rights.\nGeography.\nLocation.\nVantaa is located in southern Finland, in the region of Uusimaa and the Helsinki sub-region. It is separated from the Gulf of Finland by Helsinki. Prior to the abolition of Finnish provinces in 2009, Vantaa was a part of the Southern Finland Province.\nThe city borders Helsinki, the Finnish capital, which is to the south and southwest. Other neighbouring municipalities are Espoo to the west; Nurmij\u00e4rvi, Kerava, and Tuusula to the north; and Sipoo to the east. Vantaa is a part of the Finnish Capital Region, which is the inner core of the Helsinki capital region.\nSubdivision.\nVantaa is divided into seven major regions (, ): Tikkurila \"(Dickursby)\", Hakunila \"(H\u00e5kansb\u00f6le)\", Koivukyl\u00e4 \"(Bj\u00f6rkby)\", Korso, Aviapolis, Myyrm\u00e4ki \"(Myrbacka)\", and Kivist\u00f6. These major regions are then divided into a total of 60 city districts, the most populated of which are Myyrm\u00e4ki, Martinlaakso, Hakunila, and Pakkala.\nFeatures.\nVantaa consists mostly of lowlands cut up by rivers. According to a survey done by the National Land Survey of Finland on 1 January 2022, Vantaa encompasses , of which is water. The city is mostly suburban and urban area with some rural landscape, notably in the districts of Sotunki and Seutula. Average population density is , which rises above in concentrated urban districts like Myyrm\u00e4ki and Tikkurila.\nThe river Vantaa runs through western Vantaa, and its tributary Keravanjoki runs through eastern Vantaa. In 1966, the rural municipality of Helsinki (now known as Vantaa) lost the district of Vuosaari to Helsinki proper, cutting it almost completely off from the sea. Up to 2008, Vantaa still reached the seashore at its southeastern corner at the Porvarinlahti bay, until the \"V\u00e4sterkulla wedge\" with its seashore was annexed into Helsinki together with part of Sipoo in 2009. Thus Vantaa formally became the second largest inland city in the Nordic countries after Tampere.\nFor its area, Vantaa has relatively few lakes. The city encompasses two natural lakes: \"Kuusij\u00e4rvi\" in Kuninkaanm\u00e4ki and \"Lammaslampi\" P\u00e4hkin\u00e4rinne, H\u00e4meenkyl\u00e4. In addition to these, there is an artificial lake, \"Silvolan tekoj\u00e4rvi\". Vantaa shares two lakes with Espoo: \"Odilampi\" and \"Pitk\u00e4j\u00e4rvi\". Of the lakes in the Sipoonkorpi National Park, Bisaj\u00e4rvi and most of Gumb\u00f6le tr\u00e4sk are located in Vantaa. Ponds formed in sand pits include Vetokannas, renovated into a swimming beach and the Vaaralanlammet ponds in Vaarala.\nThe easternmost districts of Vantaa, Rajakyl\u00e4 and L\u00e4nsim\u00e4ki, are located right next to the border to Helsinki and are connected to the Helsinki districts of Vesala and Mellunm\u00e4ki. Part of the turnstile of the Mellunm\u00e4ki metro station is located in Vantaa.\nVantaa exhibits frequent exposed granite bedrock ground, which is common in Finland. Resulting from erosion in the last glacial period (about 10,000 years ago), elevated surfaces often lack soil (superficial deposits), revealing bare stone unsuitable for most plant life. Other geological impacts of the last Ice Age include a series of eskers running through central Vantaa, which is one of the best sources of groundwater in the city. After the glacial period, most of the area of the current city of Vantaa was underwater except for the highest hills. As the land rose, bays stretching far inland were left behind, along with the river Vantaa, which changed its discharge from M\u00e4t\u00e4oja to Keravanjoki about two millennia ago. The bays flushed against the hills leaving shore formations still visibile today. They also formed flat deposits of clay at the bottom, which now form valleys especially along the rivers.\nFlora.\nVantaa belongs to the taiga zone and its flora represents the southern parts of the zone. Vantaa is located at the border between the southern boreal zone characteristic of inland southern Finland and the hemiboreal subzone characteristic of southwestern Finland.\nThe hemiboreal subzone is a transition subzone between coniferous and deciduous forests, and deciduous trees growing naturally in the subzone include oaks and elms. The river valleys running through Vantaa have previously been full of lush groves, but today most of them are farmed land. However, at some places they are connected to lush mixed forests, transitioning into shadowy spruce forests at some places.\nThere are prominent alder meadows along the river M\u00e4t\u00e4oja, which are home to various rare insect and plant species. The most common type of forest in Vantaa is a blueberry conifer forest with spruce and birch trees, whereas dry forests are only located at bare cliff areas.\nThe second most common forest type in Vantaa is the more lush grove-like forest. Its undergrowth includes blueberry, wood sorrel, herb Paris and lady fern, as well as wood anemone at some places.\nThere are lush groves growing mosaically among the forests, containing common southern grove plants such as the liverwort. The groves in Vantaa vary greatly, ranging from moist and shady spruce groves growing ostrich fern to dry groves growing liverwort and common hazel and hardwood groves. In springtime during the first weeks of May the wood anemone flowers very noticeably in almost all groves and grove-like forests, which is characteristic to the forest growth in southwestern and southern Finland.\nThere is a centuries-old oak forest in the district of Tammisto, which is considered to be the only natural oak forest in the Finnish capital area. The forest has been protected under the nature preservation law in 1946.\nAlthough Vantaa is a very urbanised area, a great deal of its surface area still remains as rural fields or forest. The city of Vantaa contains 12.41 square kilometres of nature preserved area (about 5% of the surface area of the city). The first nature preserve area in Vantaa was founded in 1946 in Tammisto. There are two especially protected species in the nature preserve areas in Vantaa, the beetle species \"Hylochares cruentatus\" and the orchid species \"Malaxis monophyllos\".\nClimate.\nVantaa has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfb). The city has four distinct seasons, the amount of precipitation is relatively uniform throughout the year. The driest season is spring. Summers are generally relatively warm and winters are cold. Although the city does not have a coastline along the Baltic Sea, it is close enough to experience the mitigating influence of the sea and the Gulf Stream. The record low temperature in Vantaa is and the record high temperature is .\nThe coldest month of the year is in February, when the average temperature based on measurements from 1981 to 2010 was -5.8 degrees Celsius. After this, the temperatures rise rapidly. The average temperature in April for the same period is +4.0 degrees and the one in May is +10.5 degrees. The warmest month of the year is in July, when the average temperature is +17.7 degrees. The second warmest month is in August with an average temperature of +15.7 degrees and the third warmest is June with an average temperature of +14.7 degrees. The average number of hot weather days in Vantaa is 17, of which over half occur in July on average. In sporadic years hot weather can extend to September. The summer thunderstorm period in Vantaa is very short and varying: it typically starts around Midsummer and ends in middle August, peaking at the end of July.\nThe temperatures lower in autumn slower than they rise in spring. The average day temperature in November is +0.3 degrees and the one in December is -3.3 degrees. In autumn and early winter low pressure storm fronts move eastwards from the Atlantic Ocean passing over Vantaa. Vantaa's location in Fennoscandia warmed by the Gulf Stream near the coast of the Gulf of Finland makes Vantaa a clearly more temperate area than the average based on its latitude. For example, the southern tip of Greenland is located south of Vantaa, as are the tundra areas of the Labrador Peninsula. The period when Vantaa is normally covered in snow is typically from late December to early April, after which the snow rapidly melts away.\nSpring in Vantaa experiences significantly less rain than autumn. The average monthly rainfall in February through May is only about 30 to 40 millimetres. In summer the weather becomes rainier, and the average monthly rainfall in July through November is 60 to 80 millimetres. The rainfall varies greatly throughout the year: in the late months of the year there are monthly rainfalls of less than 20 millimetres, as well as over 200 millimetres. Respectively, the weather becomes drier in the early months of the year. The total average rainfall in Vantaa in a year is 682.9 millimetres.\nDemographics.\nPopulation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe city of Vantaa has inhabitants, making it the most populous municipality in Finland. The city of Vantaa is part of the Helsinki metropolitan area, which is the largest urban area in Finland with inhabitants. The city of Vantaa is home to 4% of Finland's population. 29.2% of the population has a foreign background, which is three times higher than the national average.\nIn 2017, 69% of people aged 15 and over in Vantaa had completed higher education, meaning that 31% of the population had completed primary education at most. 38% had completed upper secondary education. Of the population with tertiary education (31%), 9% had the lowest degree, 12% had a lower degree and 9% had a higher degree.\nThe average income in Vantaa is lower than elsewhere in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, but still higher than in the rest of Finland. On the other hand, housing in Vantaa is on average cheaper than in Helsinki and Espoo. Income levels in Vantaa vary widely due to differences between suburbs and single-family areas. On average, women in Vantaa earn about 71% of men's income, which is slightly higher than the Finnish average (69%). Many families with children live in Vantaa, accounting for about 55% of all households. Women make up 50.2% of the population of Vantaa.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Bar chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLanguages.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe city of Vantaa is officially bilingual, with both Finnish and Swedish as official languages. As of 2024[ [update]], the majority of the population, , spoke Finnish as their first language. There are Swedish speakers in Vantaa, or of the population. This compares with in Helsinki and in Espoo. The number of Swedish speakers in Vantaa has remained more or less constant over the decades, but the proportion of Swedish speakers in the city has declined steadily as a result of immigration. In 1960, about ten per cent of the population of Vantaa spoke Swedish. In 1980, the proportion was about five per cent. Since the beginning of the 20th century, Vantaa has been a predominantly Finnish-speaking municipality.\nVantaa remains officially bilingual, as the Finnish Language Act states that a municipality must be declared bilingual if the number of speakers of the official minority language (Finnish or Swedish) is at least 8% of the population or 3,000 people. In relation to the total population, the proportion of Swedish speakers in Vantaa is the lowest of all bilingual municipalities in Finland. Among Vantaa's districts, the proportion of Swedish speakers was highest in Helsingin pit\u00e4j\u00e4n kirkonkyl\u00e4 (19.0%), Sotunki (16.6%) and Luhtaanm\u00e4ki (11.5%) in 2019.\nThe number of people who speak S\u00e1mi, Finland's third official language, is only inhabitants. In Vantaa, of the population speak a mother tongue other than Finnish or Swedish. As English and Swedish are compulsory school subjects, functional bilingualism or trilingualism acquired through language studies is not uncommon.\nThere are at least 100 different languages spoken in Vantaa. The most common foreign languages are Russian (4.3%), Estonian (3.4%), Arabic (2.4%), Albanian (2.0%), Somali (1.3%) and English (1.3%).\nImmigration.\nAs of 2024[ [update]], there were 73,487 people with a migrant background living in Vantaa, or 29% of the population. There were 61,603 residents who were born abroad, or 25% of the population. The number of foreign citizens living in Vantaa was 42,366.\nAmong the major Finnish cities, Vantaa has the highest proportion of immigrants \u2013 more than three times the national average. Moreover, the city's new residents are increasingly of foreign origin. This will increase the proportion of foreign residents in the coming years.\nReligion.\nIn 2023, the Evangelical Lutheran Church was the largest religious group with 47.0% of the population of Vantaa. Other religious groups accounted for 4.5% of the population. 48.6% of the population had no religious affiliation. The Finnish Orthodox Church had 1.2% of the population. The proportion of members of the Lutheran Church has steadily decreased in the 21st century, while the proportion of people with no religious affiliation has steadily increased.\nLutheran congregations.\nAccording to the 2018 division of Vantaa, the following congregations of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland are located in Vantaa:\nTogether these congregations form the Union of congregations in Vantaa (Finnish: \"Vantaan seurakuntayhtym\u00e4\", Swedish: \"Vanda kyrkliga samf\u00e4llighet\").\nSince 2016 Vantaa has been home to the Lutheran congregation of the Holy Trinity belonging to the Evangelical Lutheran Mission Diocese of Finland.\nOther congregations.\nOf the congregations of the Orthodox Church of Finland, the Orthodox congregation of Helsinki is active in Vantaa. The Tikkurila Orthodox Church is located near the Tikkurila sports park in Viertola\nOf the member congregations of the Pentecostal Church of Finland, the Myyrm\u00e4ki Pentecostal congregation, Vantaan Kotikirkko and Vantaan Minttukirkko are active in Vantaa. Independent Pentecostal congregations in Vantaa include the Credo church, the Korso Pentecostal congregation and Seutulan Betania.\nThe Vantaa free congregation, belonging to the Free Church of Finland, is located in Hiekkaharju, and the congregation has also founded the Free congregation of western Vantaa in Askisto in western Vantaa.\nThe Finnish branch office of the Jehovah's Witnesses, which is the highest level of the organisation in Finland, is located in Koivuhaka. There are two Kingdom Halls in Vantaa, in Koivuhaka and in Martinlaakso.\nEconomy.\nEconomy of the city of Vantaa.\nIn the latest years, Vantaa has stabilised its economy via an economy and debt program accepted in 2012. The growth of the loan stock was stopped by the end of the council term from 2013 to 2017. In 2016 the city managed to decrease its loan stock a little, which had grown to over one billion euro.\nVantaa has been in increasing debt since the early 2000s, due to a decrease in state funding and an increase in investments. A contributing factor to its situation is the high concentration of families with children, leading to comparatively larger social expenditure. According to the former mayor Juhani Paajanen, the worst expenditures have ended, and the city's gains are increasing.\nOn a nation-wide perspective, Vantaa has a high level of tax income, but in perspective of the capital region, the tax income of Vantaa is lower than those of Espoo and Helsinki. The state subsidy system and its stabilisation of tax income based on a nation-wide comparison have been seen as problematic because of special challenges of the cities in the capital region and because of constant rapid growth.\nThe municipal tax in Vantaa is 19.00%, which is clearly below the average in Finland and one of the lowest in the large cities. The last time Vantaa raised its municipal tax was in 2010. The state of Finland has raised the lower limit of the property tax because of new legislation.\nIn a comparison of characteristic figures of large cities Vantaa has developed positively in the latest years. In regard to municipal concerns and financing various investments, the differences in loan amounts in the cities have balanced out. In the early 2000s over half of the city's debt consisted of rental apartments owned by the city (managed by the company VAV Asunnot Oy). On the other hand, the city ended up in a crisis mainly because it had made large investments in its own balance with borrowed money. The city has hardly sold any of its property in the early 2000s.\nJobs and industry.\nBecause of good traffic connections, Vantaa has a large amount of food, HVAC and machinery industry as well as businesses. There are industrial areas along the Ring III beltway, particularly near the airport and in the neighbouring districts of Viinikkala, Veromies, Pakkala and Koivuhaka as well as in Hakkila, connected to the main railway line by a branch terminal line. The Aviapolis area has developed around the airport, containing many businesses in logistics and high technology. In 2000 74.6% of the jobs in the city were in services, 23.8% in refinery and only 0.5% in agriculture. In 2001 the rate of self-sufficiency in jobs in Vantaa had risen to 97.1%. In the 2000s the number of jobs in Vantaa had grown by about 15%.\nOf those employed, two thirds are in the private sector. The most common industries in Vantaa include the food, architectural engineering, and machine industries. In 2007, the unemployment rate was 6.3%.\nCompanies that have their headquarters in Vantaa (at the Helsinki Airport, in Aviapolis) include Finnair, Finavia and Nordic Regional Airlines. Companies with headquarters in Vantaa outside of Aviapolis include R-kioski, Tikkurila Oyj, Veikkaus Oy, and Mets\u00e4hallitus. Fujifilm Finland has its headquarters in Vantaa.\nAn interesting future possibility for Vantaa and for the entire capital region comes from the Ring Rail Line, which allows for significant increase in the number of apartments and jobs and provides a direct rail connection from the main railway line to the Helsinki Airport. The Ring Rail Line required an investment of over one hundred million euro from Vantaa. The city of Helsinki had been proposing the idea of joining the municipalities in the capital region, in order to better develop the area, for decades. The cities of Vantaa, Espoo and Kauniainen have rejected this idea each time, although Vantaa has done so a bit more slowly than the others. The municipal and city managers of Vantaa have repeatedly rejected Helsinki's proposal fearing Vantaa would become a \"backyard\" of Helsinki. Helsinki has been expanding towards Vantaa throughout the 20th century, including the great annexation in 1946 and the annexation of Vuosaari in 1966. Through the annexation of \u00d6stersundom in Sipoo and the V\u00e4sterkulla wedge to Helsinki in 2009, Vantaa lost its only connection to the sea, becoming the second-largest inland city in the Nordic countries, after Tampere.\nArts and culture.\nVantaa culture award.\nThe Vantaa culture award is awarded each year as a recognition of significant contributions to the arts and the artistic life in the city, to a person living in Vantaa or to a community active in the city. The award was first awarded in 1976.\nThe decision to award the Vantaa culture award is made by the city council. In 2015, the award was worth 10 thousand euro. Award winners include jazz musician Juhani Aaltonen, musicians Maarit and Sami Hurmerinta, sculptor Heikki H\u00e4iv\u00e4oja, director Matti Kassila, architect Alpo Halme, writer Virpi H\u00e4meen-Anttila together with here husband professor Jaakko H\u00e4meen-Anttila, actor Lasse P\u00f6ysti, the Raatikko dance theatre, entertainer Virve Rosti, writer Alpo Ruuth, opera singer Esa Runttunen and the Vantaa children's ballet.\nSymbols.\nThe signature animal of Vantaa is the salmon, also featured in the coat of arms of the city, the traditional dish is salmon soup and the signature plant is the common dog-violet.\nMusic.\nThere are about 20 choirs in Vantaa, like Vantaan Laulu and Vantaa Chamber Choir.

The \"Vantaan musiikkijuhlat\" festival was founded in 2010, continuing the previous festival's tradition in concentrating on older music. The newer festival covers a longer time period, and according to the artistic director Markku Luolajan-Mikkola the festival concentrates more on periodical instruments than any specific time period.\nThe \"Her\u00e4tt\u00e4j\u00e4juhlat\" festival of the Awakening movement was held in Vantaa in 2016.\nMuseums.\nTikkurila is home of the major science centre in Finland, Heureka, opened in April 1989. The purpose of the science centre is to develop the understanding of scientific information and to develop methods of scientific education. The name Heureka refers to the famous statement \"I have found it!\" by Archimedes.\nThe city museum of Vantaa is located in the old station building of the railway station in Tikkurila which has exhibitions with various themes on local history. The museum is housed in the oldest station building in Finland, designed by Carl Albert Edelfelt and completed in 1861. The museum moved to the building after it was renovated in autumn 1990. The first two floors of the red brick museum building host exhibits and the third floor hosts the offices of the museum staff.\nThe Finnish Aviation Museum is located in Vantaa, near Helsinki Airport.\nConcert house Martinus.\nThe concert house Martinus in Martinlaakso, built in 1987, offers premises for various events ranging from meetings and seminars to cultural events.\nBecause of its good acoustics, the concert hall has been used for many musical recordings.

Several key freeways and highways, such as Ring III, Tuusulanv\u00e4yl\u00e4 and Porvoonv\u00e4yl\u00e4, originate in or pass through the municipality. Other widely used connections in the direction of Helsinki include H\u00e4meenlinnanv\u00e4yl\u00e4, Lahdenv\u00e4yl\u00e4 and Vihdintie.\nPublic transport in Vantaa consists of a bus network and commuter rail, provided by HSL/HRT and VR. Since the introduction of the Ring Rail Line in 2015, Vantaa has had a total of 14 stations. Key railway stations also act as central bus stations.\nBus transport in Vantaa is extensive: there are over one hundred bus lines in Vantaa, of which the majority are internal lines in Vantaa and the rest are regional lines travelling to Helsinki, Espoo and Kerava.\nOf the express bus stops in Vantaa, the stops at Kaivoksela, Martinlaakso and Keimolanportti are located along H\u00e4meenlinnanv\u00e4yl\u00e4, while the stop at Tammisto is located along Tuusulanv\u00e4yl\u00e4 and the stops at Vantaanportti and Ilmakeh\u00e4 are located between Tuusulanv\u00e4yl\u00e4 and the Helsinki Airport. The stop at Tuupakka serves the express buses between the Helsinki Airport and Tampere. There are no express bus stops along Lahdenv\u00e4yl\u00e4 in Vantaa. However, the express buses between Lahti and the Helsinki Airport stop at Korso. The express buses from the Helsinki Airport to Porvoo and Kotka stop at the Tikkurila intersection on the Ring III beltway.\nTwo of the three railway lines exiting Helsinki pass through Vantaa, connecting the city's 14 stations. The Helsinki\u2013Riihim\u00e4ki railway passes through eastern Vantaa while the Ring Rail Line forms a loop throughout Vantaa, going from Helsinki via Myyrm\u00e4ki railway station in western Vantaa to the Helsinki Airport station and then continuing via Tikkurila railway station in eastern Vantaa back to Helsinki. All long-distance trains exiting Helsinki via the Helsinki\u2013Riihim\u00e4ki railway stop at Tikkurila railway station in Vantaa, including trains going to Russia.\nThe stations on the Vantaankoski railway are Myyrm\u00e4ki, Louhela, Martinlaakso and Vantaankoski. The stations on the Ring Rail Line are Vehkala, Kivist\u00f6, Aviapolis, Helsinki Airport and Leinel\u00e4. The stations on the main railway are Tikkurila railway station, Hiekkaharju, Koivukyl\u00e4, Rekola and Korso. There are also direct local bus connections to the Helsinki Airport from the Martinlaakso and Vantaankoski stations as well as the Korso and Koivukyl\u00e4 stops. There are preliminary plans for a new station at Vallinoja between Korso and Savio with the working name \"Urpia\". In 2004 a fourth track to Kerava was added to the main railway, so local trains and long-distance trains now run on separate tracks. The Ring Rail Line was completed in 2015, connecting the main railway with the Vantaankoski railway, also travelling via the Helsinki Airport. The completion of the Ring Rail Line has sped up development of new residential and office areas. For example, the number of jobs in the Vantaankoski area has doubled. An idea contest was held for new design ideas in the area.\nThe largest airport in Finland, and the primary airport of metropolitan area, Helsinki Airport, is located in Vantaa. It attracted a total of 17.1 million passengers in 2016 and a total of 18.9 million passengers in 2017. The airport has done well in international comparisons. The airport splits Vantaa roughly into an eastern and a western part: the administrative centre and the main concentration of population are mostly located in eastern Vantaa.\nOn 16 December 2019 the city council of Vantaa approved the investment of 400 million euro to the planning of the Vantaa light rail with votes 45 to 22. The planned route leads from Mellunm\u00e4ki via Hakunila, Tikkurila and Aviapolis to the Helsinki Airport.\nAs a major transport hub, Vantaa suffers from extensive noise and pollution caused by airplanes, railways and motorways. According to noise research, over 77,000 citizens of Vantaa live in an area experiencing over 55\u00a0dB of noise. Road noise in Vantaa is caused by the Ring III beltway, H\u00e4meenlinnanv\u00e4yl\u00e4, Tuusulanv\u00e4yl\u00e4, Lahdenv\u00e4yl\u00e4 and Porvoonv\u00e4yl\u00e4. About 7000 citizens of Vantaa live in an area experiencing noise from airplane traffic and about 9000 live in an area experiencing noise from railway traffic.\nWaste.\nThe largest waste incinerator in Finland, the Vantaa incinerator, is located at Vantaa.\nEducation.\nPrimary education.\nVantaa offers diverse opportunities in primary education. The city has a total of 50 Finnish-speaking, five Swedish-speaking, and one English-speaking primary and junior high schools. The schools come in various sizes, of which the smallest is the Swedish-speaking Kyrkoby skola, which has been located in the same school building since 1837. In contrast, the largest primary schools in Vantaa are Finnish-speaking schools of over 800 students such as the Mikkola and Lehtikuusi schools.\nSecondary and vocational education.\nVantaa has five Finnish-speaking upper secondary schools, including Tikkurila Upper Secondary, the largest upper secondary school in the Nordic Countries, as well as one Swedish-speaking upper secondary school. In addition, Vantaa has a Steiner school including primary and secondary education, online education at the Sotunki Upper Secondary and adult education at the Tikkurila Upper Secondary.\nFor vocational education, Vantaa has several vocational schools, such as the Varia vocational school, the Mercuria school of business economics, the Vocational school for probation, Ty\u00f6tehoseura and Edupoli, of which the latter two offer vocational training for youths and adults and hold vocational screening. Vocational education for special groups is offered by the Vantaa offices of the Vocational school Live and the Kiipula vocational school. It is also possible to take the Finnish matriculation examination in connection with vocational education (a double examination for example in the Varia vocational school).\nTertiary education.\nVantaa has two universities of applied sciences: Metropolia and Laurea. Metropolia has offices in Myyrm\u00e4ki (technical education and Metropolia Business School) and Tikkurila (institution for design). Laurea offers education in communications and social and healthcare in Tikkurila.\nEducational institutions.\nThe Vantaa institution for adult education is one of the largest educational institutions in Finland.

{"id": "42195", "revid": "390477", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42195", "title": "1948 Winter Olympics", "text": "Multi-sport event in St. Moritz, Switzerland\nThe 1948 Winter Olympics, officially known as the V Olympic Winter Games (; ; ; ) and commonly known as St. Moritz 1948 (; ), were a winter multi-sport event held from 30 January to 8 February 1948 in St. Moritz, Switzerland. The Games were the first to be celebrated after World War II; it had been twelve years since the last Winter Games in 1936.\nFrom the selection of a host city in a neutral country to the exclusion of Japan and Germany, the political atmosphere of the post-war world was inescapable during the 1948 Games. The organizing committee faced several challenges due to the lack of financial and human resources consumed by the war. These were the first of two winter Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of Sigfrid Edstr\u00f6m.\n28 nations marched in the opening ceremonies on 30 January 1948. Bibi Torriani played for the Switzerland men's national ice hockey team and became the first ice hockey player to recite the Olympic Oath on behalf of all athletes. Nearly 670 athletes competed in 22 events in four sports. The 1948 Games also featured two demonstration sports: military patrol, which later became the biathlon, and winter pentathlon, which was discontinued after these Games. Notable performances were turned in by figure skaters Dick Button and Barbara Ann Scott and skier Henri Oreiller. Most athletic venues have existed since St. Moritz first hosted the Winter Games in 1928. All the venues were outdoors, meaning the Games were heavily dependent on favorable weather conditions.\nHost city selection.\nThe IOC selected St. Moritz to host the 1948 Games by acclamation at the 40 general session in Lausanne, Switzerland, on 6 September 1946. The selection process consisted of two bids, and saw St. Moritz be selected ahead of Lake Placid, New York, United States. St. Moritz was chosen because all of the venues of the 1928 Winter Olympics were available, and the Swiss resort could organize the Games much quicker than any other city except for 1936 host Garmisch-Partenkirchen which was not considered. Despite the existence of many of the 1928 sites, it was still a difficult task to organize a Winter Olympic Games in less than 18 months.\nOrganizing.\nThe Comit\u00e9 Olympique (CO) was composed of local dignitaries and members of the Swiss National Olympic Committee (COS). They decided to separate into several sub-committees responsible for various aspects of the Games. These committees included housing and maintenance, venue construction, finances, and media and advertising. The local committees worked very closely with the Swiss federal government and the IOC to ensure that the organization of the Games proceeded without hindrance. Since no athletes' village existed from the previous Games, the athletes and officials were housed in hotels around the city. It was essential for the committees to draw upon their experiences from the 1928 Olympics. Their selection of locations for the various events was contingent on the weather conditions, as all the events were held outdoors.\nOver 800 people were involved in reporting the news of the Games to the world. Nearly 500 press credentials were issued by the Press Commission for the Games. Television would not make its Olympic debut until 1956. The coverage of the 1948 Games was split between newspapers and radio broadcasts. The organizing committee had to provide technology, such as long-distance telephone lines and telegraph services, to assist the press in communicating with their constituents.\nOver 2,200 people were needed to provide all the services for the press, officials, and athletes at the Games. These services included sanitation, security, and care of the venues. Accommodating the influx of people into St. Moritz was difficult for the organizing committee. It was complicated by the mountainous region in which the community was situated. A massive project to improve the village's transportation infrastructure had to be completed before the Games. This included building and widening roads for vehicular traffic. Several train stations were built to accommodate the increased demands for public transit. They also had to increase the capacity of the city's sewers. All of the projects had to be approved by the Swiss government and justified by its impact on the success of the Games. To aid the organizing committee, the IOC demanded that all participating nations provide lists of their athletes several months before the Games. Consequently, the Swiss knew exactly how many athletes and officials to plan for.\nPolitics.\nSince these Games were the first since World War II, they were named \"The Games of Renewal\". Japan and Germany were not invited to these Games because the international community still ostracized them for their role in World War II. Their absence was short-lived, though, as they returned to Olympic competition in 1952. The Soviet Union did not send athletes to the St. Moritz Games of 1948, but they did send ten delegates as observers of the Games to determine how successful the Soviet athletes would have been had they competed.\nImpact of World War II.\nSapporo, Japan had been the choice for the 1940 Winter Games. In 1938, the Japanese decided to decline the invitation to host the Games claiming that preparations for the Olympic Games were draining the country's resources. The IOC turned to the host of the 1936 Games, Garmisch-Partenkirchen, which would make it the only city to host consecutive Games. This became impractical when Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939; subsequently Germany withdrew its bid to host the Games. Finland believed it could host the Games and extended an invitation to the IOC, but the Soviet Union's invasion of Finland ended all hope of an Olympic Games in 1940. The 1944 Winter Olympics had been awarded to Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy in 1939. As the war continued, this proved impractical, and the second consecutive olympiad passed without celebrating the Games. The IOC was presented with two possible host cities for the first post-war Games: Lake Placid, United States and St. Moritz, Switzerland. The IOC decided to award the Games to Switzerland, a neutral country immediately following World War II, to avoid political posturing by former combatants.\nThe impact of World War II was still being felt in 1948. The lack of financial resources and human energy made the organization of the Games challenging. Athletes were also affected by a lack of resources. Many competitors arrived with little or no equipment. In one notable case, Norwegian skiers had to borrow skis from the American team to compete.\nEvents.\nMedals were awarded in 22 events contested in 4 sports (9 disciplines).\nThere were also two demonstration sports, military patrol and the winter pentathlon.\nBobsled.\nTwo sliding sports were contested at the 1948 Winter Games; the first was bobsled. A controversy erupted when it was alleged that the sleds of the United States team had been sabotaged. It was discovered that the steering wheels had been damaged. After news broke of the apparent improprieties a truck driver stepped forward and admitted to having accidentally backed into the shed housing the bobsleds. The accident, however, did not hinder the United States teams, who won a bronze in the two-man event and a gold and a bronze in the four-man event. The Swiss two-man teams placed first and second, which is the best possible result for the event since only two teams were allowed to enter. The driver of the first place team, Felix Endrich, beat his coach, the driver of the second place team, Fritz Feierabend.\nIce hockey.\nThe ice hockey tournament was won by Canada, with Czechoslovakia second and Switzerland third. This was the fifth Olympic gold medal for Canada in hockey. The only team to beat Canada since hockey was introduced at the 1920 Summer Olympics was Great Britain at the 1936 Winter Olympics. The tournament was almost canceled when rival teams representing the United States arrived. An Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) team was supported by the United States Olympic Committee (USOC), and an Amateur Hockey Association (AHA) team was supported by the Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace (LIHG). The International Olympic Committee ruled that neither team could compete. Still, the Swiss organizing committee allowed the AAU team to march in the opening ceremony and the AHA team to play unofficially without being eligible for medals.\nFigure skating.\nBarbara Ann Scott became the first and only Canadian woman to win an Olympic gold medal in figure skating when she won the competition at St. Moritz. Despite the distraction caused by a low-flying airplane during her compulsory routine, she could muster the focus to place first entering the free skate. The ice had been shredded the night before the free skate by two ice hockey games (the ice resurfacer had not yet been invented); nonetheless, she was able to adjust her routine to avoid the potholes and emerge victorious.\nEighteen-year-old American Dick Button completed the unprecedented North American sweep of the figure skating gold medals. He led the field after the compulsory skate and won the gold medal by becoming the first person to complete a double Axel in competition. Later in the 1952 Olympics, Dick Button would win gold a second time. Swiss world champion Hans Gerschwiler fell during the free skate, but rebounded to win the silver medal.\nSpeed skating.\nThe speed skating competition was held on the same rink that had hosted the events in 1928. At above sea level, the speed skating competition was held at the second-highest altitude in Olympic history; only Squaw Valley in 1960 was higher. The competition was dominated by the Scandinavian countries of Norway and Sweden who won nine out of the twelve possible medals. Scandinavians had done poorly in speed skating events up until the 1948 Games. Their success was because speed skating in Europe had reached a standstill during World War II. Only countries that were ancillary to the conflict had the resources to keep their speed skating programs intact. The 500\u00a0meter race was won by Finn Helgesen of Norway. There was a three-way tie for second place between Norwegian Thomas Byberg and Americans Robert Fitzgerald and Kenneth Bartholomew. All three had finished in exactly 43.2\u00a0seconds. Swede \u00c5ke Seyffarth won a gold medal in the 10,000\u00a0meter race and a silver medal in the 1,500\u00a0meter race. The 5,000\u00a0meter event was affected by weather. The twenty racers encountered wind, sun, and snow during the day's competition. Finally, long-distance specialist Reidar Liaklev from Norway prevailed.\nAlpine skiing.\nAlpine skiing made its Olympic debut at these Games. A few events had been held at the 1936 Games, but the St. Moritz Games featured a full slate of three men's and three women's alpine events. Frenchman Henri Oreiller won a medal in all three Alpine events: gold in the downhill and combined, and bronze in the slalom. He was one of only two athletes to win two gold medals at the 1948 Games, and he was also the only athlete to win three or more medals.\nAustria dominated the women's alpine events, winning five out of nine possible medals. Trude Beiser was a double-medal winner, earning gold in the combined event and silver in the downhill. She was not the only female skier to win two medals, though United States skier Gretchen Fraser won gold in the slalom and took silver behind Beiser in the combined. Austrian Erika Mahringer earned two medals by winning bronze medals in both the slalom and the combined.\nCross-country skiing.\nIn cross-country skiing, 106 skiers from 15 nations competed in three events. The events were the 50\u00a0kilometer race, the 18\u00a0kilometer race, and the 4\u00a0x\u00a010\u00a0kilometer relay. There were no women's events at the 1948 Games. Martin Lundstr\u00f6m of Sweden was the other athlete to win two gold medals when he won the 18\u00a0kilometer race and participated on the winning cross-country relay team. Sweden won seven out of fifteen possible medals in the Nordic events, including all three gold medals and a sweep of the 18\u00a0kilometer race. All fifteen medals were won by either Sweden, Norway, or Finland.\nSkeleton.\nSkeleton made its second appearance at the Olympics during these Games. It debuted in St. Moritz at the 1928 Winter Olympics. Skeleton was a form of luge that had originally appeared in the St. Moritz region at the end of the 19th century. American John Heaton won his second Olympic medal in the skeleton; he won his first 20\u00a0years earlier when he was 19\u00a0years old. Italian slider Nino Bibbia won the gold medal. It was the first of his 231 career wins on the Cresta Boblsed track. One of the curves at Cesana Pariol, where the bobsled, luge, and skeleton events took place at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, was named after Bibbia.\nNordic combined.\nThe Nordic combined event had been contested at each Winter Olympics since 1924. Nordic combined required athletes to first compete in the open 18\u00a0kilometer cross-country ski race alongside the other cross-country competitors. Their times would be assigned a point value. The athletes would take two jumps off the ski jump hill two days later. The jumps would be given a point value, and the longest jump would be combined with their cross-country time to create a score. Traditional Nordic combined power Norway was stunned at the 1948 Games when Finland's Heikki Hasu became the first non-Norwegian to win the event. Norway did not even make the podium. Hasu's teammate Martti Huhtala took the silver, and Sven Israelsson from Sweden won the bronze.\nSki jumping.\nThe Norwegians swept the ski jumping event. Birger Ruud had won the gold medal in the ski jumping event at both the 1932 and 1936 Winter Games. The twelve-year hiatus due to World War II meant that Ruud was 36 years old in 1948. He had retired from competition and was coaching the Norwegian team. However, when he arrived at the Games, he decided to come out of retirement and compete one last time. Despite not having competed for several years, he earned a silver medal. Norwegian Petter Hugsted won the gold and teammate Thorleif Schjelderup won the bronze.\nDemonstration sports.\nTwo demonstration sports were held at the 1948 Games. Military patrol had been a demonstration sport at the 1924, 1928, and 1936 Winter Olympic Games. It entailed a combination of cross-country skiing and shooting at targets. Eventually the competition would be renamed Biathlon and was made an official Olympic medal sport at the 1960 Games in Squaw Valley, United States. Winter pentathlon involved five competitions: 10\u00a0kilometer cross-country ski race, shooting, downhill skiing, fencing and horseback riding. This was the first and last time the event was held. Fourteen competitors took part in the event.\n\"All dates are in Central European Time (UTC+1)\"\nCalendar.\nThe opening ceremonies were held at 10:00 am on 30 January, along with the initial hockey games and the first two runs of the two-man bobsled. The closing ceremonies were held at 4:00 pm on 8 February. All of the medals were awarded at the closing ceremonies rather than immediately after the event, as current tradition dictates.\nVenues.\nThe Stad Olympique (Olympic Stadium) hosted the opening and closing ceremonies. The stadium was also used for speed skating, the figure skating competition, and the medal games for ice hockey. Most of the ice hockey games were held at the \"Suvretta\" and \"Kulm\" stadiums in St. Moritz. Bobsled was held at the St. Moritz-Celerina Olympic Bobrun. Skeleton was contested on the Cresta Run track. Olympia Bob Run was built in 1897 and modernized for the 1948 Games, while the Cresta Run was first constructed in 1885. The ski jump competitions were held at Olympiaschanze ski jump hill in St. Moritz. It was built in 1927 for the 1928 Games and remained in use until 2006. The alpine events were held on ski-runs in and around Piz Nair.\nParticipating nations.\nTwenty-eight nations competed in St. Moritz, the same number as the previous Winter Games in 1936. Chile, Denmark, Iceland, Korea, and Lebanon all made their Winter Olympic debut at these Games. Germany and Japan were not invited because of their involvement in World War II. Despite being an Axis power, Italy was allowed to send athletes after it defected to the Allies in 1943. Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania had been annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 and would not compete again as independent nations until 1992. Argentina returned to the Winter Games after missing the 1932 and 1936 Games, and Australia and Luxembourg did not compete in 1948, even though they had participated in 1936.\nMedal count.\nThese are the top ten nations that won medals at the 1948 Winter Games.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Following a twelve-year hiatus caused by the outbreak of World War II, these were the first Summer Olympics held since the 1936 Games in Berlin. The 1940 Olympic Games had been scheduled for Tokyo and then for Helsinki, while the 1944 Olympic Games had been provisionally planned for London. This was the second time London hosted the Olympic Games, having previously hosted them in 1908, making it the second city to host the Summer Olympics twice (after Paris). The Olympics would return again to London 64 years later in 2012, making London the first city to host the games thrice, and the only such city until Paris, who hosted their third games in 2024, and Los Angeles, who will host theirs in 2028. The 1948 Olympic Games were also the first of two summer Games held under the IOC presidency of Sigfrid Edstr\u00f6m. So far, the only Summer Olympics to be held in the 1940s as the 1940 and 1944 Summer Olympics were cancelled due to World War II\nThe 1948 Olympics came to be known as the \"Austerity Games\" due to the difficult economic climate and rationing imposed in the aftermath of World War II. No new venues were built for the games (with events taking place mainly at Wembley Stadium, also known as Empire Stadium, and the Empire Pool at Wembley Park), and athletes were housed in existing accommodation at the Wembley area instead of an Olympic Village, as were the 1936 Games and the subsequent 1952 Games in Helsinki. A record 59 nations were represented by 4,104 athletes, 3,714 men, and 390 women in 19 sport disciplines. Germany and Japan were not invited to participate in the games; the Soviet Union was invited but chose not to send any athletes, sending observers instead to prepare for the 1952 Olympics. Israel requested to participate (symbolically represented by Raya Bronstein and Frieda Berson-Lichtblau) but was denied as the International Olympic Committee did not yet recognize the country, while the Olympic mandate of Palestine expired. This in turn shifted the view of the Arab countries who had intended to boycott the event and now decided to take part.\nOne of the star performers at the 1948 Games was Dutch sprinter Fanny Blankers-Koen. Dubbed the \"Flying Housewife\", the thirty-year-old mother of two won four gold medals in athletics. In the decathlon, Bob Mathias of the United States became the youngest male ever to win an Olympic track and field gold medal at the age of seventeen. The most individual medals were won by Veikko Huhtanen of Finland, who took three golds, a silver and a bronze in men's gymnastics. The United States topped the medal table.\nElection as host city.\nIn June 1939, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) awarded the 1944 Olympic Summer Games to London, ahead of Rome, Detroit, Budapest, Lausanne, Helsinki, Montreal and Athens. World War II stopped the plans and the Games were cancelled so London again stood as a candidate for 1948. Great Britain almost handed the 1948 games to the United States due to post-war financial and rationing problems, but King George VI said that hosting the Olympics would help to restore Britain from World War II. The official report of the London Olympics shows that London was not pressed to run the Games against its will. It says:\nThe Games of 1944 had been allocated to London and so it was that in November 1945, the Chairman of the British Olympic Council, Lord Burghley, went to Stockholm and saw the president of the International Olympic Committee to discuss the question of London being chosen for this great event. As a result, an investigating committee was set up by the British Olympic Council to work out in some detail the possibility of holding the Games. After several meetings they recommended to the council that the Lord Mayor of London should be invited to apply for the allocation of the Games in 1948.\nIn June 1946 the IOC, through a postal vote, gave the summer Games to London and the winter competition to St Moritz. London was selected ahead of Baltimore, Minneapolis, Lausanne, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia.\nLondon, which had previously hosted the 1908 Summer Olympics, became the second city to host the Olympics twice; Paris hosted the event in 1900 and 1924. London later became the first city to host the Olympics for a third time when the city hosted the 2012 Summer Olympics.\nOrganization.\nLord Burghley, a gold medal winner at the 1928 Olympics, member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and president of the Amateur Athletics Association was named Chairman of the Organising and Executive Committees. The other members of the committees were: Colonel Evan Hunter, General Secretary of the British Olympic Association, and Chief de mission for Great Britain; Lord Aberdare, the other British member of the IOC; Sir Noel Curtis-Bennett; Alderman H.E. Fern; E.J. Holt; J. Emrys Lloyd, who became the committee's legal advisor; C.B. Cowley of the London Press and Advertising; R.B. Studdert, managing director of the Army &amp; Navy Stores; A.E. Porritt, a member of the IOC for New Zealand who resided in London; S.F. Rous, Secretary of The Football Association; and Jack Beresford.\nOlympic pictograms were introduced for the first time. There were twenty of them\u2014one for each Olympic sport and three separate pictograms for the arts competition, the opening ceremony and the closing ceremony. They were called \"Olympic symbols\" and intended for use on tickets. The background of each pictogram resembled an escutcheon. Olympic pictograms appeared again 16 years later, and were used at all subsequent Summer Olympics.\nAt the time of the Games, food, petrol and building were still subject to the rationing imposed during the war in Britain; because of this the 1948 Olympics came to be known as the \"Austerity Games\". Athletes were given the same increased rations as dockers and miners, 5,467 calories a day instead of the normal 2,600. Building an Olympic Village was deemed too expensive, and athletes were housed in existing accommodation. Male competitors stayed at RAF camps in Uxbridge and West Drayton, and an Army camp in Richmond Park; female competitors in London colleges. Lord Burghley unfurled the Olympic Flag at the Richmond Park camp at an opening ceremony in July as Minister of Works, Charles Key, declared the camp open.\nThese were the first games to be held following the death of Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the International Olympic Committee, in 1937. They were also the last to include an arts competition, which took place at the Victoria and Albert Museum.\nTorch relay.\nNicknamed \"relay of peace\" due to crossing through several countries in Europe to represent their union after the Second World War, the torch relay for these games took place from 17 to 29 July 1948, with a distance of and 1,416 torchbearers.\nThe torch was designed by Ralph Lavers. There were three types of torches: the standard one made of aluminium and powered by solid fuel, a special one powered by butane gas (used aboard ) and a third one used in the Wembley stadium, made of stainless steel and powered by a magnesium candle.\nThe journey began with the lighting of the flame in Olympia. Due to the civil war taking place in Greece, the Greek part of the relay went directly to Corfu, where HMS \"Whitesand Bay\" picked the flame to transport it to Bari. From there, the flame crossed Italy, Switzerland, France, Luxembourg and Belgium. After a boat trip from Calais to Dover (aboard of ), the flame traveled to several towns in Southeast England until the arrival at Wembley for the Opening ceremony.\nThe cities and towns visited by the Olympic flame were as follows:\nOpening ceremony.\nThe Games opened on 29 July. Army bands began playing at 2 pm for the 85,000 spectators in Empire Stadium at Wembley Park. The international and national organisers arrived at 2.35\u00a0pm and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, with Queen Mary and other members of the Royal Family, at 2.45\u00a0pm. Fifteen minutes later the competitors entered the stadium in a procession that took 50\u00a0minutes. The last team was that of the United Kingdom. When it had passed the saluting base, Lord Burghley began his welcome:\nYour Majesty: The hour has struck. A visionary dream has today become a glorious reality. At the end of the worldwide struggle in 1945, many institutions and associations were found to have withered and only the strongest had survived. How, many wondered, had the great Olympic Movement prospered?\nAfter welcoming the athletes to two weeks of \"keen but friendly rivalry\", he said London represented a \"warm flame of hope for a better understanding in the world which has burned so low.\"\nAt 4\u00a0pm, the time shown on the clock tower on the London Games symbol, the King declared the Games open, 2,500 pigeons were set free and the Olympic Flag raised to its flagpole at the end of the stadium. The Royal Horse Artillery sounded a 21-gun salute to welcome the last runner in the Torch Relay: John Mark, a British track and field sprinter and student at the University of Cambridge with impressive Olympian good looks. Mark ran a lap of the track \u2013 created with cinders from the domestic coal fires of Leicester \u2013 and climbed the steps to the Olympic cauldron. After saluting the crowd, he turned and lit the flame. After more speeches, Donald Finlay of the British team (given his RAF rank of Wing Commander) took the Olympic Oath on behalf of all competitors. The National Anthem was sung and the massed athletes turned and marched out of the stadium, led by Greece, tailed by Britain.\nThe 580-page official report concluded:\nThus were launched the Olympic Games of London, under the most happy auspices. The smooth-running Ceremony, which profoundly moved not only all who saw it but also the millions who were listening-in on the radio throughout the world, and the glorious weather in which it took place, combined to give birth to a spirit which was to permeate the whole of the following two weeks of thrilling and intensive sport.\nTelevision coverage.\nThe opening ceremony and over 60 hours of Games coverage was broadcast live on BBC television, which was then officially available only in the London area. However, the BBC's transmissions could be received much further away in the right conditions, and some of the Games were watched by at least one viewer in the Channel Islands. The BBC's official report on the coverage estimated that an average of half a million viewers watched each of their Olympic broadcasts. The BBC paid \u00a31,000 for the broadcasting rights.\nOf the live television coverage, only a small section of the opening ceremony broadcast still exists in the archives. However, various filmed reports shot for the BBC's \"Television Newsreel\" program do also still exist.\nSports.\nThe 1948 Summer Olympics featured 136 medal events, covering 23 disciplines in 17 different sports and in arts.\nIn the list below, the number of events in each discipline is noted in parentheses.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThese Games also included Lacrosse and Swedish (Ling) gymnastics as demonstration sports.\nAthletics.\nEmpire Stadium was the venue for 33 athletics events at the Games; 24 for men and nine for women. Of these, four were making their Olympic debut \u2013 the men's 10\u00a0km walk, and the women's 200\u00a0metres, long jump and shot put. A total of 754 athletes from 53 countries participated in athletics. Fanny Blankers-Koen of the Netherlands, a 30-year-old mother of two children nicknamed \"The Flying Housewife\", won four gold medals, in the 100\u00a0metres, 200\u00a0metres, 80\u00a0metre high hurdles, and 4\u00a0x\u00a0100\u00a0metre relay. As world record holder in the long jump and high jump Blankers-Koen may have been able to win further medals but, at this time, female athletes were limited to three individual events. Duncan White won the first medal of any kind for Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) when he finished second in the 400\u00a0metre hurdles. Arthur Wint became the first Jamaican to win an Olympic gold medal, in the men's 400\u00a0metres; he also won silver in the men's 800\u00a0metres. Audrey Patterson became the first African-American woman to win a medal, winning bronze in a track and field event. A few days later Alice Coachman became the first woman of colour in the world and the first African-American woman to win a gold medal in track and field in the history of the modern Olympics with a jump of 1.68\u00a0m (5' 6&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20444\"). She also was the only American woman to win an athletics gold medal during the 1948 Olympics.\nThe marathon saw a dramatic finish with the first man to enter the stadium, Etienne Gailly of Belgium, exhausted and nearly unable to run. While he was struggling, Argentinian athlete Delfo Cabrera and Tom Richards of Great Britain passed him, with Cabrera winning the gold medal and Richards obtaining the silver. Gailly managed to recover enough to cross the line for the bronze.\nThe decathlon was won by 17-year-old Bob Mathias of the United States. He became the youngest ever Olympic gold medallist in athletics and when asked how he would celebrate he replied: \"I'll start shaving, I guess.\"\nArts.\nCategories: sports-related architecture, literature, music, painting, and sculpture. These Olympics were the last time art competitions were considered Olympic events.\nBasketball.\nBasketball made its second appearance as a medal sport, appearing as an indoor competition for the first time after poor weather disrupted the matches at the 1936 Berlin Games. The event, for men only, was contested by 23 nations split into four pools for the preliminary round; the top two in each pool advanced to the quarterfinals with the other teams entering playoffs for the minor placings. The United States and France reached the final which was won by the Americans 65\u201321 to claim the gold medal. This was the second of the United States' seven consecutive gold medals in Olympic men's and women's basketball. Brazil defeated Mexico 52\u201347 to claim bronze.\nBoxing.\nEight different classifications were contested ranging from flyweight, for boxers weighing less than 51\u00a0kg, to heavyweight, for boxers over 80\u00a0kg. South Africa, Argentina and Hungary each won two gold medals.\nCanoeing.\nNine events were contested, eight for men and one for women. This marked the first time that a women's canoeing event had been contested in the Olympics. Sweden won four gold medals (two by Gert Fredriksson) and Czechoslovakia three.\nCycling.\nSix events were contested \u2013 two road bicycle racing events and four track cycling events. No women's cycling events were contested. France won three gold medals and Italy two, while Great Britain captured five medals overall, but none were gold.\nDiving.\nFour diving events were contested, two for men, and two for women. The events are labelled as 3\u00a0 metre springboard and 10\u00a0 metre platform by the International Olympic Committee but appeared on the 1948 Official Report as \"springboard diving\" and \"highboard diving\", respectively. All four gold medals, and 10 out of 12 awarded in total, were won by the United States. Victoria Manalo Draves, who won both gold medals in the women's events, and Sammy Lee, who took a gold and a bronze in the men's events, became the first Asian Americans to win gold medals at an Olympic Games.\nEquestrian.\nSix gold medals were awarded in equestrian, individual and team dressage, individual and team eventing and individual and team show jumping. Harry Llewellyn and Foxhunter, who would claim a gold medal in Helsinki, won bronze in the team jumping event.\nFencing.\nSeven events were contested, six for men and one for women. Ilona Elek, who had won the women's foil competition in Berlin, was one of only two competitors to successfully defend an Olympic title in London. Elek's sister, Margit, placed sixth in the same event. Edoardo Mangiarotti won three medals, two silver and a bronze, having previously won a gold medal in the 1936 Games. Throughout his career the Italian won 13 Olympic fencing medals and 27 world championship medals, both of which remain records.\nField hockey.\nThirteen nations participated in the field hockey competition. The tournament was ultimately won by India, who defeated Great Britain to claim the country's first gold medal as an independent nation under captain Kishan Lal and Vice-Captain Kunwar Digvijay Singh.\nFootball.\nEighteen teams entered the football competition at these Olympics. Due to the rise of the professional game during the 12 years since the Berlin Olympics the number of talented amateurs for teams to select from was reduced. The gold medal was won by Sweden, who defeated Yugoslavia 3\u20131 in the final. Denmark defeated hosts Great Britain, managed by Matt Busby of Manchester United, 5\u20133 to win the bronze medal. In the tournament's 18 matches a total of 102 goals were scored; an average 5.66 goals per match. The joint top scorers with seven goals each were Gunnar Nordahl of Sweden and Denmark's John Hansen. Nordahl and Swedish teammates Gunnar Gren and Nils Liedholm went on to play for A.C. Milan and together were nicknamed Gre-No-Li.\nThis was the first international football tournament ever to be broadcast on television, with the two semi-finals, the bronze medal match and the final all being shown live in full by the BBC.\nGymnastics.\nNine events were contested, eight for men, and one for women. In the men's pommel horse, a tie was declared between three competitors, all Finns, and no medals other than gold were awarded in this event. Finland won six gold medals overall, and Switzerland three.\nLacrosse.\nLacrosse was an exhibition sport at these Olympics. An English team composed of players from various universities played a U.S. team represented by Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute at the Empire Stadium.\nModern pentathlon.\nOnly one modern pentathlon event was contested, the five component sports\u2013 riding, fencing, shooting, swimming, and running- being held over six days. Scoring was by point-for-place system across the five phases with the winner being the athlete with the lowest combined ranking. The sport's international federation, the Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne was founded during the Games, on 3 August 1948. Sweden won two medals in the event; William Grut won the gold, with a final points total of 16, and G\u00f6sta G\u00e4rdin took bronze. American George Moore won the silver medal.\nRowing.\nSeven rowing events were contested, all open to men only. Great Britain and the United States each claimed two gold medals. The events were held on the River Thames at Henley, over the same course as the Henley Royal Regatta.\nSailing.\nThe sailing events at the Games took place in Torquay, in the southwest of Great Britain. Five events were contested, with the United States winning four total medals. One of host nation Great Britain's three gold medals at the Games came in the Swallow class from Stewart Morris and David Bond. In the Firefly class Danish sailor Paul Elvstr\u00f8m won gold the despite the Danish Olympic Committee having misgivings about sending him to compete as the 18-year-old could speak no English. This was the first of four consecutive Olympics with a gold medal for Elvstr\u00f8m.\nShooting.\nFour events were contested, all open to both men and women, although all medals were won by men. In the 50\u00a0metre rifle, prone position, only two points separated the top three competitors. K\u00e1roly Tak\u00e1cs had been a member of the Hungary's world champion pistol shooting team in 1938 when a grenade shattered his right hand \u2013 his pistol hand. Tak\u00e1cs taught himself to shoot with his left hand and, 10 years after his injury, he won an Olympic gold medal in the rapid-fire pistol event.\nSwimming.\nEleven events were contested, six for men and five for women. The United States won eight gold medals, including all six men's events, and 15 medals in total.\nWater polo.\nEighteen nations fielded a team in these games, which were ultimately won by Italy, who were undefeated throughout. The tournament was conducted in a mult-tier bracket, with the best four teams from the group stages participating in a final round-robin bracket. Silver was claimed by Hungary, and bronze by the Netherlands.\nWeightlifting.\nSix events were contested, all for men only. These games marked the addition of the bantamweight class to the Olympic programme, the first change to the programme since 1920. The United States won four gold medals, and eight overall; the remaining two gold medals were claimed by Egypt. Rodney Wilkes won the first medal for Trinidad and Tobago in an Olympic games, winning silver and Mohammad Jafar Salmasi won the first medal for Iran in an Olympic games, winning bronze in the featherweight division; gold medal was won by Egyptian Mahmoud Fayad, with a new Olympic and World record of 332.5\u00a0kg.\nWrestling.\nSixteen wrestling events were held, eight Greco-Roman and eight freestyle. All were open to men only. Both categories were dominated by two nations. Turkey was the most successful nation with six gold medals followed by Sweden receiving 5 gold medals. These two teams claimed 24 total medals, in other words half of the total medals given.\nPolitical defection.\nLondon was the first Olympics to have a political defection. Marie Provazn\u00edkov\u00e1, the 57-year-old Czechoslovak President of the International Gymnastics Federation, refused to return home, citing \"lack of freedom\" after the Czechoslovak coup in February led to the country's inclusion in the Soviet Bloc.\nMedia.\nFor the 1948 Olympics, the Technicolor Corporation devised a bipack colour filming process \u2013 dubbed \"Technichrome\" \u2013 whereby hundreds of hours of film documented the events in colour, without having to use expensive and heavy Technicolor cameras.\nSlightly over 2,000 journalists attended the 1948 Games.\nVenues.\nNo new venues were built for the Games. A cinder track was laid inside Empire Stadium and all other venues were adapted. For the first time at the Olympics swimming events were held undercover, at the 8000 capacity Empire Pool. As the pool was longer than the standard Olympic length of 50\u00a0metres a platform was constructed across the pool which both shortened it and housed officials. In 2010 one of the last remaining venues from the Games, the Herne Hill Velodrome where cycling events were staged, was saved when a new 15-year lease was agreed meaning that repairs could take place. Campaigners and users of the track had feared that it would be forced to close as it was in desperate need of refurbishment.\nParticipating National Olympic Committees.\nA total of 59 nations sent athletes. Thirteen made their first official appearance: British Guiana (now Guyana), Burma (now Myanmar), Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Iraq, Jamaica, Korea, Lebanon, Pakistan, Puerto Rico, Singapore, Syria, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela. It was the first time that Australia, New Zealand, Philippines, India and Pakistan competed as fully independent nations at the Olympic Games. Germany and Japan, under Allied military occupations, were not allowed to send athletes to the games. Due to continuing labour shortages, German prisoners of war were used for the construction of the facilities for the games, in particular Olympic Way. Italy, although originally an Axis power, had defected to the Allies in 1943 following Benito Mussolini being deposed, and was allowed to send athletes. The Soviet Union was invited but chose not to send any athletes, sending observers instead to prepare for the 1952 Olympics.\nThe nations that returned to the games were Cuba, Iran (The last participation of a Persian athlete was in Paris 1900), Ireland, Panama and Spain.\nOther nations, besides Germany and Japan, that participated in the previous games in Berlin 1936 but were absent in London 1948 were Bolivia, Bulgaria, Costa Rica, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. In the case of the Baltic nations, they had been occupied and annexed by the Soviet Union, only returning to the games many decades later. Bulgaria, Romania and Mandatory Palestine accepted invitations for the Games but withdrew a few days before it began.\nAthletes from Puerto Rico, an unincorporated territory and commonwealth of the United States, competed for the United States team. Bermuda, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Singapore and British Guyana were part of the British Empire.\nMedal count.\nThese are the top ten nations that won medals at the 1948 Summer Games, ranked by number of gold medals won. The host nation was 12th, with 27 medals, including four golds.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Schulz", "text": "American cartoonist (1922\u20132000)\nCharles Monroe \"Sparky\" Schulz ( ; November 26, 1922 \u2013 February 12, 2000) was an American cartoonist who created the long-running comic strip \"Peanuts\", featuring the characters Charlie Brown and Snoopy.\nSchulz was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and developed an interest in drawing while growing up in Saint Paul. He was conscripted in 1943 and served in the United States Army during the final years of World War II. After returning to Minnesota, Schulz began his comic strip career with \"Li'l Folks\" in 1947.\nIn 1950, Schulz redeveloped \"Li'l Folks\" as a four-panel comic strip and submitted it to United Features Syndicate, who renamed it \"Peanuts\" and began publishing that October. Schulz relocated to Northern California with his family in 1958. Beginning with \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\" in 1965, he helped write several animated television specials and four animated films based on his characters. He continued drawing \"Peanuts\" until his death in 2000.\nSchulz is regarded as one of the most influential cartoonists in history, influencing other cartoonists including Jim Davis, Murray Ball, Bill Watterson, Matt Groening and Dav Pilkey. He was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 1983 and the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1996, and was posthumously inducted into the United States Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 2007.\nEarly life and education.\nCharles Monroe Schulz was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on November 26, 1922, and grew up in nearby Saint Paul. He was the only child of the barber Carl Fredrich August Schulz and Dena Bertina (n\u00e9e Halverson), and was of German and Norwegian descent. His uncle called him \"Sparky\" after the horse Spark Plug in Billy DeBeck's comic strip \"Barney Google\", which Schulz enjoyed reading. Schulz attended Saint Paul Central High School.\nSchulz loved drawing and sometimes drew his family dog, Spike, who ate unusual things, such as pins and tacks. In 1937, Schulz drew a picture of Spike and sent it to \"Ripley's Believe It or Not!\". His drawing appeared in Robert Ripley's syndicated panel, captioned, \"A hunting dog that eats pins, tacks, and razor blades is owned by C. F. Schulz, St. Paul, Minn.\" and \"Drawn by 'Sparky'\". Schulz's drawings were rejected by his high school yearbook. A five-foot-tall statue of Snoopy was placed in the school's office 60 years later. After graduating, Schulz took a correspondence course from Art Instruction Schools.\nMilitary service and post-war positions.\nIn November 1942, Schulz was drafted into the United States Army. He served as a staff sergeant with the 20th Armored Division in Europe during World War II as a squad leader on a .50 caliber machine gun team. His unit saw combat at the very end of the war. Schulz said he had only one opportunity to fire his machine gun but forgot to load it, and that the German soldier he could have fired at surrendered. Years later, Schulz proudly spoke of his wartime service. For being under fire he received the Combat Infantry Badge, of which he was proud. \nIn February 1943, Schulz's mother died after a long illness from cervical cancer. Schulz was with her as she died at home and later described his sadness that she never saw his work published. In late 1945, Schulz returned to Minnesota, where he did lettering for a Roman Catholic comic magazine, \"Timeless Topix.\" In July 1946, Schulz took a job at Art Instruction, where he reviewed and graded students' work. He worked there for several years as he developed his career as a comic creator. At the school, he proposed marriage to a redhaired woman, Donna Johnson, who turned him down. Johnson inspired the Little Red-Haired Girl, Charlie Brown's unrequited love, in \"Peanuts\".\nCareer.\nThe anti-Communist propaganda comic book \"Is This Tomorrow\" (1947) featured some of Schulz's early work. Schulz's first group of regular cartoons, a weekly series of one-panel jokes called \"Li'l Folks\", was published from June 1947 to January 1950 in the \"St. Paul Pioneer Press,\" with Schulz usually doing four one-panel drawings per issue. It was in \"Li'l Folks\" that Schulz first used the name Charlie Brown for a character, although he applied the name in four gags to three different boys as well as one buried in sand. The series also had a dog that looked much like Snoopy. In May 1948, Schulz sold his first one-panel drawing to \"The Saturday Evening Post\"; within the next two years, a total of 17 untitled drawings by Schulz were published in the \"Post\", simultaneously with his work for the \"Pioneer Press\". Around the same time, he tried having \"Li'l Folks\" syndicated through the Newspaper Enterprise Association; Schulz would have been an independent contractor for the syndicate, unheard of in the 1940s, but negotiations broke down. \"Li'l Folks\" was dropped from the \"Pioneer Press\" in January 1950.\nLater that year, Schulz approached United Feature Syndicate (UFS) with \"Li'l Folks\", and the syndicate became interested. By that time, Schulz had also developed a comic strip, usually using four panels rather than one; to Schulz's delight, the syndicate preferred the longer version. However, to his consternation, the syndicate had to change the title for Schulz's strip for legal reasons. Schulz selected the name \"Peanuts\".\n\"Peanuts\" first appeared on October 2, 1950, in seven newspapers. The weekly Sunday page debuted on January 6, 1952. After a slow start, \"Peanuts\" eventually became one of the most popular comic strips in history, as well as one of the most influential. Schulz also had a short-lived sports-oriented comic strip, \"It's Only a Game\" (1957\u201359); however, he abandoned it after the success of \"Peanuts\". From 1956 to 1965 he contributed a gag cartoon, \"Young Pillars\", featuring teenagers, to \"Youth\", a publication associated with the Church of God.\nIn 1957 and 1961, Schulz illustrated two volumes of Art Linkletter's \"Kids Say the Darndest Things.\" In 1964, he illustrated a collection of letters, \"Dear President Johnson\", by Bill Adler.\n\"Peanuts\".\nAt its height, \"Peanuts\" was published daily in 2,600 papers in 75 countries, in 21 languages. Over nearly 50 years, Schulz drew 17,897 published \"Peanuts\" strips. The strips, plus merchandise and product endorsements, produced revenues of more than $1 billion per year, with Schulz earning an estimated $30\u201340 million annually. During the strip's run, Schulz took only one vacation, a five-week break in late 1997 to celebrate his 75th birthday; reruns of the strip ran during his vacation, the only time that occurred during Schulz's life.\nRinehart &amp; Company published the first collection of \"Peanuts\" strips in July 1952. Many more books followed, greatly contributing to the strip's increasing popularity. In 2004, Fantagraphics began their \"Complete Peanuts\" series. \"Peanuts\" also proved popular in other media; the first animated TV special, \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\", aired in December 1965 and won an Emmy award. Numerous TV specials followed, the latest being \"\" in 2024. Until his death, Schulz wrote or co-wrote the TV specials, as well as the films \"A Boy Named Charlie Brown\", \"Snoopy Come Home\", \"Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown\" and \"Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown (and Don't Come Back!!)\", and oversaw their production.\nCharlie Brown, the principal character of \"Peanuts\", was named after a co-worker at Art Instruction Inc. Schulz drew much from his own life. Some examples include:\nInfluences.\nThe Charles M. Schulz Museum cites Milton Caniff (\"Terry and the Pirates\") and Bill Mauldin as key influences on Schulz's work. In his own strip, Schulz regularly described Snoopy's annual Veterans Day visits with Mauldin, including mention of Mauldin's World War II cartoons. Schulz also credited George Herriman (\"Krazy Kat\"), Roy Crane (\"Wash Tubbs\"), Elzie C. Segar (\"Thimble Theatre\") and Percy Crosby (\"Skippy\") as influences. In a 1994 address to fellow cartoonists, Schulz discussed several of them. But according to his biographer Rheta Grimsley Johnson:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It would be impossible to narrow down three or two or even one direct influence on [Schulz's] personal drawing style. The uniqueness of \"Peanuts\" has set it apart for years ... That one-of-a-kind quality permeates every aspect of the strip and very clearly extends to the drawing. It is purely his with no clear forerunners and no subsequent pretenders.\nAccording to the museum, Schulz watched the 1941 film \"Citizen Kane\" 40 times. The character Lucy van Pelt also expresses a fondness for the film; in one strip, she cruelly spoils the ending for her younger brother.\nBiographer David Michaelis wrote that Schulz considered Jim Davis, the author of \"Garfield\", his greatest rival. Schulz disliked Davis's low, broad-appeal approach and was jealous when \"Garfield\" eclipsed \"Peanuts\" in popularity. However, Schulz frequently provided advice to the younger Davis, particularly in the realms of merchandising and franchising, by using the strategy he had developed for Snoopy and allowing Davis to develop it further for Garfield. Davis considered Schulz a valuable mentor. Davis credits Schulz with redesigning Garfield in his modern form; while Schulz and Davis were working on their \"Peanuts\" and \"Garfield\" television specials in adjacent rooms, Davis was struggling to work Garfield's obese, quadrupedal physique into physical gags and asked Schulz for ideas. Schulz sketched out a redesign\u2014bipedal and pot-bellied but slimmer\u2014that Davis has used in its basic form since.\nSchulz had a mutual respect for Robb Armstrong, the author of \"Jump Start\"; for the 1994 special \"You're in the Super Bowl, Charlie Brown\", Schulz gave Franklin the last name \"Armstrong\" in homage. Armstrong would later collaborate with Schulz's sons on the streaming special \",\" part of the Apple TV+ series \"Snoopy Presents\".\nPersonal life.\nIn April 1951, Schulz married Joyce Halverson, who was not related to his mother Dena Halverson Schulz. He also adopted Halverson's daughter, Meredith Hodges. Later the same year, they moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado. Their son, Monte, was born in February 1952; three more children, Craig, Amy and Jill, were born later in Minnesota.\nSchulz and his family moved to Minneapolis and stayed until 1958. They then moved to Sebastopol, California, where Schulz built his first studio. Until then, he had worked at home or in a small rented office room. It was there that Schulz was interviewed for the unaired television documentary \"A Boy Named Charlie Brown\". Some of the footage was eventually used in a later documentary, \"Charlie Brown and Charles Schulz\". Schulz's father died while visiting him in 1966, the same year Schulz's Sebastopol studio burned down. By 1969, Schulz had moved to Santa Rosa, California, where he lived and worked until his death. While briefly living in Colorado Springs, Schulz painted a mural on the bedroom wall of his daughter Meredith, featuring Patty with a balloon, Charlie Brown jumping over a candlestick, and Snoopy playing on all fours. The wall was removed in 2001, and donated and relocated to the Charles M. Schulz Museum in Santa Rosa.\nBy Thanksgiving of 1970, Schulz's marriage was strained, and the couple divorced in 1972. He married Jean Forsyth Clyde in September 1973, whom he had first met when she brought her daughter to his hockey rink. They were married for 27 years, until Schulz's death.\nSchulz's son Craig has served as president of the Charles M. Schulz Creative Associates licensing company, located at One Snoopy Place in Santa Rosa, and has had a prominent role in modern \"Peanuts\" adaptations, including \"The Peanuts Movie\" (2015). Schulz's daughter Jill starred in the 1988 live action and animation hybrid Peanuts special \"It's the Girl in the Red Truck, Charlie Brown\".\nKidnapping attempt.\nOn May 8, 1988, two gunmen in ski masks entered Schulz's home through an unlocked door, planning to kidnap Jean, but the attempt failed when Schulz's daughter Jill drove up to the house, prompting the would-be kidnappers to flee. Sonoma County Sheriff Dick Michaelsen said, \"It was obviously an attempted kidnap-ransom. This was a targeted criminal act. They knew exactly who the victims were.\" Neither Schulz nor Jean were hurt during the incident.\nSports.\nSchulz had a long association with ice sports, and both figure skating and ice hockey featured prominently in his cartoons. In Santa Rosa, he built and owned the Redwood Empire Ice Arena, which opened in 1969 and featured a snack bar called \"The Warm Puppy Caf\u00e9\". Schulz's daughter Amy served as a model for the figure skating in the television special \"She's a Good Skate, Charlie Brown\" (1980). Schulz also was very active in senior ice-hockey tournaments; in 1975, he formed Snoopy's Senior World Hockey Tournament at his Redwood Empire Ice Arena, and in 1981, he was awarded the Lester Patrick Trophy for outstanding service to the sport of hockey in the United States. Schulz also enjoyed golf and was a member of the Santa Rosa Golf and Country Club from 1959 to 2000.\nIn 1998, Schulz hosted the first Over-75 Hockey Tournament. In 2000, the Ramsey County Board in St. Paul, Minnesota, voted to rename the Highland Park Ice Arena the Charles M. Schulz\u2013Highland Arena in his honor.\nSchulz also used his hockey rink for tennis exhibitions after meeting Billie Jean King.\nArt.\nSchulz's favorite artist in his later years was Andrew Wyeth. As a young adult, Schulz also developed a passion for classical music. Although the piano-playing character Schroeder in \"Peanuts\" adored Ludwig van Beethoven, Schulz's personal favorite composer was Johannes Brahms. He had a strong personal respect for \"Footrot Flats\" creator Murray Ball; the two men influenced each other throughout their careers.\nReligion.\nAccording to a 2015 \"spiritual biography\", Schulz's faith was complex and personal. He often touched on religious themes in his work, including in the classic television cartoon \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\" (1965), which features Linus quoting Luke 2 to explain \"what Christmas is all about.\" Schulz said that Linus represented his spiritual side, and the spiritual biography points out a much wider array of religious references.\nBrought up in a Lutheran family, Schulz was active in the Church of God as a young adult and later taught Sunday school at a United Methodist Church. In the 1960s, Robert L. Short interpreted certain themes and conversations in \"Peanuts\" as consistent with parts of Christian theology, and used them as illustrations in his lectures on the Gospel, as explained in his book \"The Gospel According to Peanuts\", the first of several he wrote on religion, \"Peanuts\", and popular culture.\nSchulz's daughter, Amy, joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints during her relationship with a Latter-day Saint boyfriend. According to Amy, Schulz told her that the \"church is either true or it's a hoax. And I think it's a hoax.\" Although Schulz was disenchanted by Mormonism and his daughter's conversion, he continued to support her and, according to Amy, told her that he appreciated the bond between the two of them created by her belief \"in Christ and the scriptures.\"\nFrom the late 1980s, Schulz said in interviews that some people had described him as a \"secular humanist\" but that he did not know one way or the other:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I do not go to church anymore ... I guess you might say I've come around to secular humanism, an obligation I believe all humans have to others and the world we live in.\nIn 2013, Schulz's widow said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I think that he was a deeply thoughtful and spiritual man. Sparky was not the sort of person who would say \"oh that's God's will\" or \"God will take care of it.\" I think to him that was an easy statement, and he thought that God was much more complicated.\nWhen he came back from the army he was very lonely. His mother had died and he was invited to church by a pastor who had prepared his mother's service from the Church of God. Sparky's father was worried about him and was talking to the pastor and so the pastor invited Sparky to come to church. So Sparky went to church, joined the youth group and for a good 4\u20135 years he went to Bible study and went to church 3 times a week (2 Bible studies, 1 service). He said he had read the Bible through three times and taught Sunday school. He was always looking for what those passages REALLY might have meant. Some of his discussions with priests and ministers were so interesting because he wanted to find out what these people (who he thought were more educated than he) thought.\nWhen he taught Sunday school, he would never tell people what to believe. God was very important to him, but in a very deep way, in a very mysterious way.\nFailing health and retirement.\nIn July 1981, Schulz underwent heart bypass surgery. During his hospital stay, President Ronald Reagan phoned to wish him a quick recovery.\nIn the 1980s, Schulz complained that \"sometimes my hand shakes so much I have to hold my wrist to draw.\" This led to an erroneous impression that Schulz had Parkinson's disease. According to a letter from his physician, placed in the Archives of the Charles M. Schulz Museum by his widow, Schulz had essential tremor, a condition alleviated by beta blockers. Schulz still insisted on writing and drawing the strip by himself, resulting in noticeably shakier lines over time.\nIn November 1999, Schulz suffered several small strokes and a blocked aorta; he was later found to have colon cancer that had metastasized. Because of the chemotherapy and because he could not see clearly, he announced his retirement on December 14, 1999. The decision was difficult for Schulz, who told Al Roker on \"The Today Show\", \"I never dreamed that this was what would happen to me. I always had the feeling that I would probably stay with the strip until I was in my early eighties. But all of a sudden it's gone. It's been taken away from me. I did not take this away from me.\"\nSchulz was asked if, in his final \"Peanuts\" strip, Charlie Brown would finally get to kick the football after so many decades (one of the many recurring themes in \"Peanuts\" was Charlie Brown's attempts to kick a football while Lucy was holding it, only to have Lucy pull it back at the last moment, causing him to fall). His response, \"Oh, no. Definitely not. I couldn't have Charlie Brown kick that football; that would be a terrible disservice to him after nearly half a century.\" But in a December 1999 interview, holding back tears, Schulz recounted the moment when he signed his final strip, saying, \"All of a sudden I thought, 'You know, that poor, poor kid, he never even got to kick the football. What a dirty trick\u2014he never had a chance to kick the football.'\"\nDeath.\nSchulz died in his sleep of a heart attack in his Santa Rosa home on February 12, 2000, at the age of 77. He was suffering from colorectal cancer. The last original \"Peanuts\" strip was published the following day. He had predicted that the strip would outlive him because the strips were usually drawn weeks before their publication. Schulz was buried at Pleasant Hills Cemetery in Sebastopol, California, where he first lived after relocating from Minnesota.\nFamily and associates, including Jean Schulz, Lynn Johnston and Rick Kirkman, paid tribute to him via media outlets. Over 40 syndicated cartoonists in addition to Kirkman and Johnston paid homage to Schulz and \"Peanuts\" on May 27 by incorporating his characters into their over 100 comic strips that day, including \"Garfield\" by fellow associate Jim Davis and \"Dilbert\" by Scott Adams.\nWhile UFS retained ownership of the strip, Schulz requested that the syndicator allow no other artist to draw \"Peanuts\". UFS honored his wishes, instead syndicating reruns. Because Schulz considered other media separate from the strip, new television specials and comic books with the \"Peanuts\" characters have been made since his death.\nAwards.\nSchulz received the National Cartoonists Society's Humor Comic Strip Award in 1962 for \"Peanuts\" and the Society's Elzie Segar Award in 1980; he was the first two-time winner of their Reuben Award (for 1955 and 1964) and the winner of their Milton Caniff Lifetime Achievement Award in 1999. He was also an avid hockey fan; in 1981, Schulz was awarded the Lester Patrick Trophy for outstanding contributions to the sport of hockey in the United States, and he was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 1993.\nIn 1988, Schulz received the Silver Buffalo Award, the highest adult award given by the Boy Scouts of America, for his service to American youth. On June 28, 1996, Schulz received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, adjacent to Walt Disney's. A replica of this star appears outside his former Santa Rosa studio. On November 2, 2015, Snoopy was also honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nOn January 1, 1974, Schulz served as the Grand Marshal of the Rose Parade in Pasadena, California. This led to the only \"Peanuts\" strip in which he made any reference to himself: Lucy was watching the parade, and told Linus that the Grand Marshal was somebody \"you've never heard of\". The same year, he received the Inkpot Award. In 1980, Schulz received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement, presented by Awards Council member Judge John Sirica.\nSchulz was a keen bridge player, and \"Peanuts\" occasionally included bridge references. In 1997, the American Contract Bridge League (ACBL) awarded both Snoopy and Woodstock the honorary rank of Life Master, and Schulz was delighted.\nOn February 10, 2000, two days before Schulz's death, Congressman Mike Thompson introduced H.R. 3642, a bill to award Schulz the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian honor the United States legislature can bestow. The bill passed the House (with only Ron Paul voting no and 24 not voting) on February 15, and the bill was sent to the Senate, where it passed unanimously on May 2. The Senate also considered a related bill, S.2060 (introduced by Dianne Feinstein). President Bill Clinton signed the bill into law on June 20, 2000. On June 7, 2001, Schulz's widow Jean accepted the award on behalf of her late husband in a public ceremony.\nSchulz was inducted into the United States Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 2007.\nSchulz was the inaugural recipient of The Harvey Kurtzman Hall of Fame Award, accepted by Karen Johnson, Director of the Charles M. Schulz Museum, at the 2014 Harvey Awards, held at the Baltimore Comic Convention in Baltimore, Maryland.\nThe U.S. Postal Service commemorated the 100th anniversary of Schulz's birth with postage stamps honoring him \"alongside his beloved characters\".\nBiographies.\nMultiple biographies have been written about Schulz, including Rheta Grimsley Johnson's \"Good Grief: The Story of Charles M. Schulz\" (1989), which Schulz authorized.\nThe lengthiest biography, \"Schulz and Peanuts: A Biography\" (2007) by David Michaelis, was widely criticized by the Schulz family; Schulz's son Monte stated it has \"a number of factual errors throughout\u00a0 ... [including] factual errors of interpretation\", and he extensively documents these errors in a number of essays. However, Michaelis maintains that there is \"no question\" his work is accurate. Although cartoonist Bill Watterson (creator of \"Calvin and Hobbes\") feels the biography does justice to Schulz's legacy, while giving insight into the emotional impetus of the creation of the strips, cartoonist and critic R.C. Harvey regards the book as falling short both in describing Schulz as a cartoonist and in fulfilling Michaelis' stated aim of \"understanding how Charles Schulz knew the world\". Harvey believes that Michaelis' biography inductively bends the facts to a thesis rather than logically deducing a thesis from the facts. Dan Shanahan's review, in the \"American Book Review\" (vol 29, no. 6), of Michaelis' biography faults the biography not for factual errors, but for \"a predisposition\" to finding problems in Schulz's life to explain his art, regardless of how little the material lends itself to Michaelis' interpretations. Shanahan cites, in particular, such things as Michaelis' crude characterizations of Schulz's mother's family, and \"an almost voyeuristic quality\" to the hundred pages devoted to the breakup of Schulz's first marriage.\nIn light of Michaelis' biography and the controversy surrounding his interpretation of Charles Schulz's personality, responses from Schulz's family reveal some intimate details about Schulz's persona beyond that of a mere artist.\nIn August 2023, author and comic artist Francesco Matteuzzi and comic artist Luca Debus, both longtime \"Peanuts\" fans, wrote and illustrated \"Funny Things: A Comic Strip Biography of Charles M. Schulz\". In panels styled after his famous work, Schulz himself narrates the story of his own life. The biography received positive reviews, with \"The Comics Journal\" noting, \"at the end of 2023, it was welcomed by many critics and readers as one of the most interesting graphic novels of that year.\"\nLegacy.\nA proponent of crewed spaceflight, Schulz was honored with the naming of Apollo 10 command module \"Charlie Brown\" and lunar module \"Snoopy\", which launched on May 18, 1969. The Communications Carrier Assembly, a cloth cap containing headphones and microphones worn within the Apollo space suit, was nicknamed the Snoopy cap because it resembled Snoopy's white head and black ears. The Silver Snoopy award is given to NASA employees and contractors for outstanding achievements related to human flight safety or mission success. The award certificate states that it is in appreciation for \"professionalism, dedication and outstanding support that greatly enhanced space flight safety and mission success\".\nOn July 1, 1983, Camp Snoopy opened at Knott's Berry Farm; it is a forested, mountain-themed area featuring the \"Peanuts\" characters. It has rides designed for younger children and is one of the most popular areas of the amusement park. Since, similar Camp Snoopy and Planet Snoopy areas have opened at several Six Flags parks.\nWhen the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, opened in 1992, its amusement park had a \"Peanuts\" theme and was called Camp Snoopy, which was replaced by Nickelodeon Universe in 2006, when the mall lost the rights to use the characters.\nThe Jean and Charles Schulz Information Center at Sonoma State University opened in 2000 and now stands as one of the largest buildings in the California State University system, as well as in all of California, with a 400,000-volume general collection and a 750,000-volume automated retrieval system capacity. The $41.5 million building was named after Schulz, and his wife donated the $5 million needed to build and furnish the structure.\nIn 2000, the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors renamed the county airport the Charles M. Schulz\u2013Sonoma County Airport. The airport's logo features Snoopy in goggles and scarf, taking to the skies on top of his red doghouse.\nPeanuts on Parade has been St. Paul, Minnesota's tribute to its favorite native cartoonist. It began in 2000 with the placing of 101 statues of Snoopy throughout the city of St. Paul. Every summer for the following four years, statues of a different \"Peanuts\" character were placed on the sidewalks of St. Paul: \"Charlie Brown Around Town\" (2001), \"Looking for Lucy\" (2002), \"Linus Blankets St. Paul (2003)\" and Snoopy lying on his doghouse (2004). The statues were auctioned off at the end of each summer, so some remain around the city, but others have been relocated. The auction proceeds were used for artist's scholarships and for permanent bronze statues of the \"Peanuts\" characters, which are in Landmark Plaza and Rice Park in downtown St. Paul.\nThe Charles M. Schulz Museum and Research Center in Santa Rosa opened in August 2002, two blocks away from his former studio, celebrating his life's work and the art of cartooning. A bronze statue of Charlie Brown and Snoopy stands in Depot Park in downtown Santa Rosa.\nSanta Rosa, California, celebrated the 55th anniversary of the strip in 2005 by continuing the Peanuts on Parade tradition, beginning with \"It's Your Town, Charlie Brown\" (2005), \"Summer of Woodstock\" (2006), \"Snoopy's Joe Cool Summer\" (2007), and \"Look Out For Lucy\" (2008).\nIn 2006, \"Forbes\" ranked Schulz as the third-highest-earning deceased celebrity, for he had earned $35 million in the previous year. In 2009, he was ranked sixth. According to Tod Benoit, Schulz's income during his lifetime totaled more than $1.1 billion.\nWhen asked about Schulz's impact in a 2007 interview, cartoonist Bill Watterson said, \"\"Peanuts\" pretty much defines the modern comic strip, so even now it's hard to see it with fresh eyes. The clean, minimalist drawings, the sarcastic humor, the unflinching emotional honesty, the inner thoughts of a household pet, the serious treatment of children, the wild fantasies, the merchandising on an enormous scale\u00a0\u2013 in countless ways, Schulz blazed the wide trail that most every cartoonist since has tried to follow.\"\nSchulz's Santa Rosa home was destroyed by the Tubbs Fire, one of the October 2017 wildfires in California.\nOn November 26, 2022, over 75 American syndicated cartoonists honored Schulz on what would have been his 100th birthday.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "42200", "revid": "3116621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42200", "title": "Peanuts", "text": "Comic strip by Charles M. Schulz\nPeanuts (briefly subtitled featuring Good ol' Charlie Brown) is a syndicated daily and Sunday American comic strip written and illustrated by Charles M. Schulz. The strip's original run extended from 1950 to 2000, continuing in reruns afterward. \"Peanuts\" is regarded as one of the most popular and influential comic strips in history, with 17,897 strips published in all, making it \"arguably the longest story ever told by one human being\". At the time of Schulz's death in 2000, \"Peanuts\" ran in over 2,600 newspapers, with a readership of roughly 355\u00a0million across 75 countries, and had been translated into 21 languages. It helped to cement the four-panel gag strip as the standard in the United States, and together with its merchandise earned Schulz more than $1\u00a0billion. Following successful animated TV and stage-theatrical adaptations over the years, five animated theatrical films have been released.\n\"Peanuts\" focuses on a social circle of young children, where adults exist but are rarely seen or heard. The main character, Charlie Brown, is meek, nervous, and lacks self-confidence. He is unable to fly a kite, win a baseball game, or kick a football held by his irascible friend Lucy, who always pulls it away at the last instant. \"Peanuts\" is a literate strip with philosophical, psychological, and sociological overtones, which was innovative in the 1950s. Its humor is psychologically complex and driven by the characters' interactions and relationships.\nSchulz drew every strip, through nearly 50 years, with no assistants, including the lettering and coloring process.\nTitle.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n \"Peanuts\" was originally sold under the title of \"Li'l Folks\", but that had been used before, so they said we have to think of another title. I couldn't think of one and somebody at United Features came up with the miserable title \"Peanuts\", which I hate and have always hated. It has no dignity and it's not descriptive. [...] What could I do? Here I was, an unknown kid from St. Paul. I couldn't think of anything else. I said, why don't we call it \"Charlie Brown\" and the president said \"Well, we can't copyright a name like that.\" I didn't ask them about \"Nancy\" or \"Steve Canyon\". I was in no position to argue.\n\u2014Charles Schulz, in a 1987 interview with Frank Pauer in \"Dayton Daily News and Journal Herald Magazine\"\n\"Peanuts\" had its origin in \"Li'l Folks\", a weekly panel cartoon that appeared in Schulz's hometown newspaper, the \"St. Paul Pioneer Press\", from 1947 to 1950 as a precursor to \"Peanuts\". Elementary details of the cartoon shared similarities to \"Peanuts\". The name \"Charlie Brown\" was first used there. The series also had a dog that looked much like the early 1950s version of Snoopy.\nSchulz submitted his \"Li'l Folks\" cartoons to United Features Syndicate (UFS), who responded with interest. He visited the syndicate in New York City and presented a package of new comic strips he had worked on, rather than the panel cartoons he submitted. UFS found they preferred the comic strip. When UFS was preparing to syndicate the comic strip as \"Li'l Folk\", Tack Knight, who authored the retired 1930s comic strip \"Little Folks\", sought to claim exclusive rights to the title being used. Schulz argued in a letter to Knight that the contraction of \"Little\" to \"Li'l\" was intended to avoid this conflict, but conceded that the final decision would be for the syndicate. A different name for the comic strip became necessary after legal advice confirmed that \"Little Folks\" was a registered trademark. Meanwhile, the production manager of UFS noted the popularity of the children's program \"Howdy Doody\". The show featured an audience of children who were seated in the \"Peanut Gallery\", and were referred to as \"Peanuts\". This inspired the decided title that was forced upon Schulz, to his lifelong consternation.\nSchulz hated the title \"Peanuts\", which remained a source of irritation to him throughout his life. He accused the production manager at UFS of not having seen the comic strip before giving it a title, and he said that the title would only make sense if there was a character named \"Peanuts\". On the day it was syndicated, Schulz's friend visited a news stand in uptown Minneapolis and asked if there were any newspapers that carried \"Peanuts\", to which the newsdealer replied, \"No, and we don't have any with popcorn either\", which confirmed Schulz's fears concerning the title. Whenever Schulz was asked what he did for a living, he would evade mentioning the title and say, \"I draw that comic strip with Snoopy in it, Charlie Brown and his dog\". In 1997 Schulz said that he had discussed changing the title to \"Charlie Brown\" on multiple occasions in the past but found that it would ultimately cause problems with licensees who already incorporated the existing title into their products, with unnecessary expenses involved for all downstream licensees to change it.\nCharacters.\nCharlie Brown.\nCharlie Brown is a young boy. He is the main character, acting as the center of the strip's world and serving as an everyman. While seen as decent, considerate, and reflective, he is also awkward, deeply sensitive, and said to suffer from an inferiority complex. Charlie Brown is a constant failure: he can never win a ballgame; he can never successfully fly a kite. His sense of determination regardless of the certainty of failure can be interpreted as either self-defeating stubbornness or admirable persistence. When he fails, however, he experiences pain and anguish through self-pity. The journalist Christopher Caldwell observed this tension between Charlie Brown's negative and positive attitudes, stating: \"What makes Charlie Brown such a rich character is that he's not purely a loser. The self-loathing that causes him so much anguish is decidedly not self-effacement. Charlie Brown is optimistic enough to think he can earn a sense of self-worth.\" Schulz named Charlie Brown after a colleague of his while working at Art Instruction, whose full name was Charlie Francis Brown.\nReaders and critics have explored whether Schulz based Charlie Brown on himself. This question often carried the suggestion that the emotionally sensitive and depressed behavior of Charlie Brown drew from Schulz's own life or childhood experiences. Commenting on the tendency of these conclusions being drawn, Schulz said in a 1968 interview, \"I think of myself as Charles Schulz. But if someone wants to believe I'm really Charlie Brown, well, it makes a good story.\" He explained in another interview that the comic strip as a whole is a personal expression, and so it is impossible to avoid all the characters presenting aspects of his personality. Biographer David Michaelis made a similar conclusion, describing Charlie Brown as simply representing Schulz's \"wishy-washiness and determination\". Regardless, some profiles of Schulz confidently held that Charlie Brown was based on him.\nSnoopy.\nSnoopy is a dog, who later in the development of the strip would be described as a beagle. While generally behaving like a real dog and having a non-speaking role, he connects to readers through having human thoughts. Despite acting like a real dog some of the time, Snoopy possesses many different anthropomorphic traits. He frequently walks on his hind legs and is able to use tools, including his typewriter. He introduces fantasy elements to the strip by extending his identity through various alter egos. Many of these alter egos, such as a \"world-famous\" attorney, surgeon or secret agent were seen only once or twice, although others (such as the World War I flying ace, or the sunglasses-wearing \"Joe Cool\") were featured many times over a period of years. His character is a mixture of innocence and egotism; he possesses childlike joy, while on occasion being somewhat selfish. He has an arrogant commitment to his independence but is often shown to be dependent on humans. Schulz was careful in balancing Snoopy's life between that of a real dog and that of a fantastical character. While the exterior of Snoopy's doghouse is of small dimensions, the interior is described in the strip as having such things as a recreation room, a library, a pool table and being adorned with paintings of Andrew Wyeth and Van Gogh. However, it was never shown, as it would have demanded an inappropriate kind of suspension of disbelief from readers.\nLinus and Lucy.\nLinus and Lucy are siblings; Linus is the younger brother, and Lucy is the older sister.\nLucy is bossy, selfish and opinionated, and she often delivers commentary in an honest albeit offensive and sarcastic way. Schulz described Lucy as full of misdirected confidence, but having the virtue of being capable of cutting right down to the truth. He said that Lucy is mean because it is funny, particularly because she is a girl: he posited that a boy being mean to girls would not be funny at all, describing a pattern in comic strip writing where it is comical when supposedly weak characters dominate supposedly strong characters. Lucy at times acts as a psychiatrist and charges five cents for psychiatric advice to other characters (usually Charlie Brown) from her \"psychiatric booth\", a booth parodying the setup of a lemonade stand. Lucy's role as a psychiatrist has attracted attention from real-life individuals in the field of psychology; the psychiatrist Athar Yawar playfully identified various moments in the strip where her activities could be characterized as pursuing medical and scientific interests, commenting that \"Lucy is very much the modern doctor\".\nLinus is Charlie Brown's most loyal and uplifting friend and introduces intellectual, spiritual and reflective elements to the strip. He offers opinions on topics such as literature, art, science, politics and theology. He possesses a sense of morality and ethical judgment that enables him to navigate topics such as faith, intolerance, and depression. Linus acts as a philosopher and open ear to Charlie Brown's dilemmas and worries. Schulz enjoyed the adaptability of his character, remarking he can be \"very smart\" as well as \"dumb\". He has a tendency of expressing lofty or pompous ideas that are quickly rebuked. He finds psychological security from thumb sucking and holding a blanket for comfort. The idea of his \"security blanket\" originated from Schulz's own observation of his first three children, who carried around blankets. Schulz described Linus's blanket as \"probably the single best thing that I ever thought of\". He was proud of its versatility for visual humor in the strip, and with how the phrase \"security blanket\" entered the dictionary.\nPeppermint Patty and Marcie.\nPeppermint Patty and Marcie are two girls who are friends. They attend a different school than Charlie Brown, on the other side of town, and so represent a slightly different social circle from the other characters.\nPeppermint Patty is a tomboy who is forthright and loyal and has what Schulz described as a \"devastating singleness of purpose\". She frequently misunderstands things, to the extent that her confusion serves as the premise of many individual strips and stories; in one story she prepares for a \"skating\" competition, only to learn with disastrous results that it is for roller skating and not ice skating. She struggles at school and with her homework and often falls asleep in school. The wife of Charles Schulz, Jean Schulz, suggested that this is the consequence of how Peppermint Patty's single father works late; she stays awake at night waiting for him. In general, Charles Schulz imagined that some of her problems were from having an absent mother.\nMarcie is bookish and a good student. Schulz described her as relatively perceptive compared to other characters, stating that \"she sees the truth in things\" (although she perpetually addresses Peppermint Patty as \"sir\"). The writer Laura Bradley identified her role as \"the unassuming one with sage-like insights\".\nSupporting characters.\nIn addition to the core cast, other characters appeared regularly for a majority of the strip's duration:\nAs well as the above, several other characters were introduced and then faded out of prominence during the strip's run:\nHistory.\nEarly development: 1950-1955.\n\"Peanuts\" began as a daily strip on October 2, 1950, in seven newspapers: \"Minneapolis Tribune\", the hometown newspaper of Schulz; \"The Washington Post\"; \"Chicago Tribune\"; \"The Denver Post\"; \"The Seattle Times\"; and two newspapers in Pennsylvania, \"Evening Chronicle\" (Allentown) and \"Globe-Times\" (Bethlehem).\nSchulz was required to draw the strip in four equally sized panels, to allow editors to run the strip horizontally, vertically, or 2-by-2.\nBy October 1951, the strip appeared in 36 newspapers. Schulz sought to rival with other then-contemporary newspaper comics, such as \"Pogo\" which appeared 80 newspapers at the time, and \"Nancy\" which appeared in 400.\nSchroeder began playing his piano in September 1951, and revealed his love for Beethoven in November 26, 1951.\nSchulz began to draw a half-page format Sunday strip that first appeared in newspapers on January 6, 1952. The strip was in 40 newspapers in the US.\nThe design of the characters quickly developed in the first two years of the strip, with less exaggerated proportions and slightly more realistic postures.\nIn February 1952, Schulz indicated that the strip had reached a certain level stylistic maturity: Schulz recommended that very early strips should not be reprinted when book publisher Rinehart &amp; Company proposed that the strips from 1950 and 1951 be collected into a book, where \"characters were beginning to develop and the ideas were changing\".\nOver the course of four years the strip began to syndicate outside of the US, being translated into Spanish and syndicated in Latin American countries with the title \"Carlitos\".\nCultural success: 1956-1987.\nOn April 9, 1965, \"Peanuts\" became the subject of an edition of \"Time\" magazine; the characters appeared on the front cover along with the title \"The World According To Peanuts\", signalling the strip's ascension in American culture. The 1960s is generally considered to be the \"golden age\" for the strip.\nThe strip appeared in 1,480 newspapers in the US by 1975, and in 175 outside the US.\nChange of format: 1988-2000.\nBeginning Leap Day, February 29, 1988, the four-panel format for the daily strip was discontinued in favor of a free-form horizontal format that offered Schulz more creative freedom; Schulz began to regularly draw three-panel strips, as well as two panel and single panel strips. Schulz's pen lines during this period began to be rendered frazzled and wobbly due to him developing an essential tremor in his hand, resulting in the graphical style of strips being significantly different than earlier decades. While such a medical condition would normally justify hiring assistant artists, as was normal for other popular newspaper comic strips at the time, Schulz asserted his ideals of craftsmanship by continuing to draw the strip like this.\nSchulz announced his retirement on December 14, 1999.\nThe last daily strip appeared on January 2, 2000. The last Sunday strip, concluding the strip as a whole, appeared on February 13, 2000. Schulz died in his sleep in his Santa Rosa, California, home on February 12, the night before the last strip; commentators have noted the close timing of these two events as unusual. Michaelis surmised, \"To the very end, his life had been inseparable from his art. In the moment of ceasing to be a cartoonist, he ceased to be\".\nReception.\nSchulz received the National Cartoonists Society Humor Comic Strip Award for \"Peanuts\" in 1962, the Reuben Award in 1955 and 1964 (the first cartoonist to receive the honor twice), the Elzie Segar Award in 1980, and the Milton Caniff Lifetime Achievement Award in 1999. \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\" won a Peabody Award and an Emmy; \"Peanuts\" cartoon specials have received a total of two Peabody Awards and four Emmys. For his work on the strip, Schulz has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (as does Snoopy) and a place in the William Randolph Hearst Cartoon Hall of Fame. \"Peanuts\" was featured on the cover of \"Time\" on April 9, 1965, with the accompanying article calling it \"the leader of a refreshing new breed that takes an unprecedented interest in the basics of life.\"\nThe strip was declared second in a list of the \"greatest comics of the 20th century\" commissioned by \"The Comics Journal\" in 1999. The top-ranked comic was George Herriman's \"Krazy Kat\", a strip Schulz admired (and in fact was among his biggest inspirations), and he accepted the ranking in good grace, to the point of agreeing with it. In 2002 \"TV Guide\" declared Snoopy and Charlie Brown tied for 8th in its list of the \"Top 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time\", published to commemorate its 50th anniversary.\nSchulz was included in the touring exhibition \"Masters of American Comics\". His work was described as \"psychologically complex\", and his style as \"perfectly in keeping with the style of its times.\"\nDespite the widespread acclaim \"Peanuts\" has received, some critics have alleged a decline in quality in the later years of its run, as Schulz frequently digressed from the more cerebral socio-psychological themes that characterized his earlier work in favor of lighter, more whimsical fare. For example, in an essay published in the \"New York Press\" at the time of the final daily strip in January 2000, \"Against Snoopy\", Christopher Caldwell argued that Snoopy, and the strip's increased focus on him in the 1970s, \"went from being the strip's besetting artistic weakness to ruining it altogether\".\nLegacy.\nAmong cartoonists.\nMany cartoonists who came after Schulz have cited his work as an influence, including Lynn Johnston, Patrick McDonnell, and Cathy Guisewite, the latter of whom stated, \"A comic strip like mine would never have existed if Charles Schulz hadn't paved the way\".\nThe December 1997 issue of \"The Comics Journal\" featured an extensive collection of testimonials to \"Peanuts.\" Over 40 cartoonists, from mainstream newspaper cartoonists to underground, independent comic artists, shared reflections on the power and influence of Schulz's art. Gilbert Hernandez wrote, \"\"Peanuts\" was and still is for me a revelation. It's mostly from \"Peanuts\" where I was inspired to create the village of Palomar in \"Love and Rockets\". Schulz's characters, the humor, the insight ... gush, gush, gush, bow, bow, bow, grovel, grovel, grovel ...\" Tom Batiuk wrote: \"The influence of Charles Schulz on the craft of cartooning is so pervasive it is almost taken for granted.\" Batiuk also described the depth of emotion in \"Peanuts\": \"Just beneath the cheerful surface were vulnerabilities and anxieties that we all experienced, but were reluctant to acknowledge. By sharing those feelings with us, Schulz showed us a vital aspect of our common humanity, which is, it seems to me, the ultimate goal of great art.\"\nCartoon tributes have appeared in other comic strips since Schulz's death in 2000 and are often displayed at the Charles Schulz Museum. On May 27, 2000, many cartoonists collaborated to include references to \"Peanuts\" in their strips. Originally planned as a tribute to Schulz's retirement, after his death that February, it became a tribute to his life and career. Similarly, on October 30, 2005, several comic strips again included references to \"Peanuts\" and specifically the \"It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown\" television special. On November 26, 2022, over 100 cartoonists included references to Peanuts and Charles Schulz in their strips to celebrate his 100th birthday.\nIn broader culture.\nRobert L. Short interpreted certain themes and conversations in \"Peanuts\" as consistent with parts of Christian theology and used them as illustrations in his lectures on the gospel, as explained in his book \"The Gospel According to Peanuts\", the first of several he wrote on religion, \"Peanuts\", and popular culture.\nGiant helium balloons of Snoopy, Charlie Brown, and Woodstock have been featured in the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City since 1968. This was referred to in a 2008 Super Bowl XLII commercial for Coca-Cola, in which the Charlie Brown balloon snags a Coca-Cola bottle from two battling balloons (Underdog and Stewie Griffin). The Snoopy balloon appeared outside the window of Leonard Bernstein's Central Park West apartment in a scene in the movie Maestro, released in 2023.\nSnoopy has been the personal safety mascot for NASA astronauts since 1968, and NASA issues a Silver Snoopy award to its employees or contractors' employees who promote flight safety. The black-and-white communications cap carrying an audio headset worn since 1968 by the Apollo, Skylab, and Space Shuttle astronauts was commonly referred to as a Snoopy cap.\nThe Apollo 10 lunar module's call sign was \"Snoopy\", and the command module's call sign was \"Charlie Brown\". While not included in the mission logo, Charlie Brown and Snoopy became semi-official mascots for the mission. Charles Schulz drew an original picture of Charlie Brown in a spacesuit that was hidden aboard the craft to be found by the astronauts once they were in orbit. This drawing is now on display at the Kennedy Space Center.\nThe name of the Brazilian rock band Charlie Brown Jr., formed in 1992, is named after the character Charlie Brown. The idea came about when Chor\u00e3o, the band's lead singer, ran over a coconut water stand where there was an image of the character printed on the facade of the establishment.\n\"Peanuts on Parade\" is St. Paul, Minnesota's tribute to \"Peanuts\". It began in 2000, with the placing of 101 statues of Snoopy throughout the city of Saint Paul. The statues were later auctioned at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota. In 2001, there was \"Charlie Brown Around Town\", 2002 brought \"Looking for Lucy\", and in 2003, \"Linus Blankets Saint Paul\". Permanent bronze statues of the Peanuts characters are found in Landmark Plaza in downtown St. Paul.\nPeanuts characters, and Charles Schulz have been recognized several times in U.S. commemorative postage stamps. A Peanuts World War I Flying Ace U.S. stamp was released on May 17, 2001. The value was 34 cents, first class. A Charlie Brown Christmas forever stamp was issued on October 2, 2015. In 2022, the U.S. Postal Service commemorated the 100th anniversary of Schulz's birth with postage stamps honoring him \"alongside his beloved characters\".\nIn 2001, the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors renamed the Sonoma County Airport, located a few miles northwest of Santa Rosa, the Charles M. Schulz Airport in his honor. The airport's logo features Snoopy as the World War I Flying Ace (goggles/scarf), taking to the skies on top of his red doghouse (the \"Sopwith Camel\"). A bronze statue of Charlie Brown and Snoopy stands in Depot Park in downtown Santa Rosa.\nBooks.\nThe \"Peanuts\" characters have been featured in many books over the years. Some represented chronological reprints of the newspaper strip, while others were thematic collections such as \"Snoopy's Tennis Book\", or collections of inspirational adages such as \"Happiness Is a Warm Puppy\". Some single-story books were produced, such as \"Snoopy and the Red Baron.\" In addition, many of the animated television specials and feature films were adapted into book form.\nThe primary series of reprints was published by Rinehart &amp; Company (later Holt, Rinehart and Winston) beginning in 1952, with the release of a collection simply titled \"Peanuts\". This series, which presented the strips in rough chronological order (albeit with many strips omitted from each year) continued through the 1980s, after which reprint rights were handed off to various other publishers. Ballantine Books published the last original series of \"Peanuts\" reprints, including \"Peanuts 2000\", which collected the final year of the strip's run.\nCoinciding with these reprints were smaller paperback collections published by Fawcett Publications. Drawing material from the main reprints, this paperback series began with \"The Wonderful World of Peanuts\" in 1962 and continued through \"Lead On, Snoopy\" in 1992.\nCharles Schulz had always resisted republication of the earliest \"Peanuts\" strips, as they did not reflect the characters as he eventually developed them. However, in 1997 he began talks with Fantagraphics Books to have the entire run of the strip, which would end up with 17,897 strips in total, published chronologically in book form. In addition to the post-millennium \"Peanuts\" publications are BOOM! Studios restyling of the comics and activity books, and \"First Appearances\" series. Its content is produced by Peanuts Studio, subsequently an arm of Peanuts Worldwide LLC.\n\"The Complete Peanuts\".\nThe entire run of \"Peanuts\", covering nearly 50 years of comic strips, was reprinted in Fantagraphics' \"The Complete Peanuts\", a 26-volume set published over a 12-year period, consisting of two years per volume published every May and October. The first volume (collecting strips from 1950 to 1952) was published in May 2004; the volume containing the final newspaper strips (including all the strips from 1999 and seven strips from 2000, along with the complete run of \"Li'l Folks\") was published in May 2016, with a twenty-sixth volume containing outside-the-daily-strip \"Peanuts\" material by Schulz appeared in the fall of that year. A companion series, titled \"Peanuts Every Sunday\" and presenting the complete Sunday strips in color (as the main \"Complete Peanuts\" books reproduce them in black and white only), was issued in ten volumes published between December 2013 through November 2022.\nIn addition, almost all \"Peanuts\" strips are now also authoritatively available online at GoComics.com (there are some strips missing from the digital archive). \"Peanuts\" strips were previously featured on Comics.com.\nAnniversary books.\nSeveral books have been released to commemorate key anniversaries of \"Peanuts\":\nAdaptations.\nAnimation.\nThe strip was first adapted into animation in \"The Tennessee Ernie Ford Show\". A TV documentary, \"A Boy Named Charlie Brown\" (1963), featured newly animated segments, but it did not air due to not being able to find a channel willing to broadcast it. It did, however, shape the team for \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\" (1965), a half-hour Christmas special broadcast on CBS. It was met with extensive critical success. It was the first of a set of \"Peanuts\" television specials (second counting the 1963 documentary), and forms a selection of holiday-themed specials which are aired annually in the US to the present day, including \"It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown\" (1966), and \"A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving\" (1973). The animated specials were significant to the cultural impact of \"Peanuts\"; by 1972, they were remarked as being \"among the most consistently popular television specials\" and \"regularly have been in the top 10 in the ratings\". Many of the specials were acquired by Apple TV+ in 2020. The first feature-length film, \"A Boy Named Charlie Brown\", came in 1969, and was one of four which were produced before the comic strip ended. A Saturday morning television series, \"The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show\" aired in 1983, each episode consisting of three or four segments dealing with plot lines from the strip. An additional spin-off miniseries, \"This Is America, Charlie Brown\", aired in 1988, exploring the history of the United States.\nThe characters continue to be adapted into animation after the comic strip ended in 2000, with the latest television special \"Snoopy Presents: A Summer Musical\" made in 2025. A series of cartoon shorts premiered on iTunes in 2008, \"Peanuts Motion Comics\", which directly lifted themes and plot lines from the strip. In 2014, the French network France 3 debuted \"Peanuts by Schulz\", a series of episodes each consisting of several roughly one-minute shorts bundled together. The latest feature-length film, \"The Peanuts Movie\", was released in 2015 by 20th Century Fox and Blue Sky Studios. Three \"Peanuts\" Apple TV+ series, Snoopy in Space, \"The Snoopy Show\", and \"Camp Snoopy\" both premiered in 2019, 2021, and 2024, respectively. The characters also make a guest appearance in \"Mariah Carey's Magical Christmas Special\" in 2020. On November 6, 2023, a new feature film from WildBrain (the company behind the recent Peanuts content since 2018) and Peanuts Worldwide was announced by Apple TV+. Production started in 2024.\nMusic.\nThe album \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\" was recorded in 1965, the original soundtrack from the animated television special of the same name. It was performed by the jazz trio led by pianist Vince Guaraldi. It enjoys enduring critical, commercial, and cultural success; employing a sombre and whimsical style, songs such as \"Christmas Time Is Here\" evoke a muted and quiet melody, and arrangements such as the traditional carol \"O Tannenbaum\" improvised in a light, off-center pace. The album has continued popularity to the present day; writer Chris Barton for the \"Los Angeles Times\" praised it in 2013 as \"one of the most beloved holiday albums recorded\", and Al Jazeera described it as \"one of the most popular Christmas albums of all time\". The album was added to the national recording registry of the Library of Congress in 2012, being regarded as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically important\".\nThe American rock band The Royal Guardsmen recorded four novelty songs from 1966 to 1968 as tributes to Snoopy. The first song was released as the single \"Snoopy Vs. The Red Baron\" (1966), based on the storyline of Snoopy sitting atop his dog house imagining himself as a World War I pilot, battling the German flying ace The Red Baron. The band would later release two more similar songs in 1967, \"Return of The Red Baron\" and \"Snoopy's Christmas\". In 1968 they recorded \"Snoopy for President\".\nTheater.\nThe characters first appeared in live stage production in 1967 with the musical \"You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown\", scored by Clark Gesner. It is a collection of musical sketches, where the characters explore their identities and discover the feelings they have for each other. The play was performed off-broadway, as well as later being performed as a live telecast on NBC. The play continued to have other professional performances, in the London West End, and later a Broadway revival, while also being a popular choice of musical by amateur theater groups such as schools.\nA second musical premiered in 1975, \"Snoopy! The Musical\", scored by Larry Grossman with lyrics by Hal Hackady. A sequel to \"You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown\", \"Snoopy!\" is also a collection of musical sketches, though focused on Snoopy. It was first performed in San Francisco, and eventually off-Broadway for 152 performances.\n\"You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown\" and \"Snoopy!!! The Musical\" were both further adapted as animated television specials, respectively, in 1985 and in 1988. Going in the opposite direction from animation to live production, is the 2016 \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\", based on the 1965 animated television special. It is considered a generally faithful readaptation, although it features the additional characters Woodstock and Peppermint Patty who did not exist in the strip when the original was made.\nLicensing.\nAdvertising and retail.\nThe characters from the comic have long been licensed for use on merchandise, the success of the comic strip helping to create a market for such items. In 1958, the Hungerford Plastics Corporation created a set of five vinyl dolls of the most famous characters (Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Lucy, Linus, and Schroeder); they expanded this line in 1961 to make the dolls slightly larger and included Sally and Pig-Pen. An early example of the characters appearing in promotional material was strips and illustrations drawn by Schulz for the 1955 instructional booklet for the Kodak Brownie camera, \"The Brownie Book of Picture Taking\". Another early campaign was on behalf of Ford Motor Company; magazine illustrations, brochure illustrations, and animated television spots featuring the characters were used to promote the Ford Falcon from January 1960 into 1964. Schulz credited the Ford campaign as the first time where licensing the characters earned \"a lot of money\". However, he expressed a dislike of illustrating the adverts, describing it as \"hard work\" and would have preferred to dedicate equivalent effort to drawing the Sunday format strips.\nSome licensing relationships were maintained long-term. Hallmark began printing greetings cards and party goods featuring the characters in 1960. In the late 1960s, Sanrio held the licensing rights in Japan for Snoopy. Sanrio is best known for Hello Kitty and its focus on the kawaii segment of the Japanese market. Beginning in 1985, the characters were made mascots and served as spokespeople for the MetLife insurance company, with the intention to make the business \"more friendly and approachable\". Schulz justified the licensing relationship with MetLife as necessary to financially support his philanthropic work, although refused to openly describe the exact details of the work he was financing. In 2016, the 31-year licensing relationship with MetLife ended. The relationship resumed in 2023 with Snoopy returning as a mascot for pet insurance.\nIn 1999, it was estimated that there were 20,000 different new products each year adorning a variety of licensed items, such as: clothing, plush toys of Snoopy, Thermos bottles, lunch boxes, picture frames, and music boxes. The familiarity of the characters also proved lucrative for advertising material in both print and television, appearing on products such as Dolly Madison snack cakes, Chex Mix snacks, Bounty paper towels, Kraft macaroni cheese and A&amp;W Root Beer.\nThe sheer extent to which the characters are used in licensed material is a subject of criticism against Schulz. \"Los Angeles Times\" pointed out that \"some critics [say] Schulz was distracted by marketing demands, and his characters had become caricatures of themselves by shilling for Metropolitan Life Insurance, Dolly Madison cupcakes and others.\" Schulz reasoned that his approach to licensing was in fact modest, stating \"our [licensing] program is built upon characters who are figuratively alive\" and \"we're not simply stamping these characters out on the sides of products just to sell products\" while also adding \"Snoopy is so versatile he just seems to be able to fit into any role and it just works. It's not that we're out to clutter the market with products. In fact anyone saying we're overdoing it is way off base because actually we are underdoing it\".\nGames.\nThe Peanuts characters have appeared in several video games, such as \"Snoopy\" in 1984 by Radarsoft, \"Snoopy: The Cool Computer Game\" by The Edge, \"Snoopy and the Red Baron\" for the Atari 2600, \"Snoopy's Silly Sports Spectacular\" (1989, Nintendo Entertainment System), \"Snoopy's Magic Show\" (1990, Game Boy), \"Snoopy Tennis\" (2001, Game Boy Color), \"Snoopy Concert\" which was released in 1995 and sold to the Japanese market for the Super NES, and in October 2006, a second game titled \"Snoopy vs. The Red Baron\" by Namco Bandai for the PlayStation 2. In July 2007, the Peanuts characters appeared in the \"Snoopy the Flying Ace\" mobile phone game by Namco Networks. In November 2015, \"Snoopy's Town Tale\" was launched for mobile by Pixowl, featuring the entire Peanuts gang along with Snoopy and Charlie Brown.\nIn 1980 (with a new edition published in 1990), the Funk &amp; Wagnalls publishing house also produced a children's encyclopedia called the \"Charlie Brown's 'Cyclopedia\". The 15-volume set features many of the Peanuts characters.\nIn April 2002, board game was released by USAopoly. The game was created by Justin Gage, a friend of Charles and Jeannie Schulz. Gage dedicated the game to Schulz in memory of his passing.\nAmusement parks.\nIn 1983, Knott's Berry Farm, in Southern California, was the first theme park to license the \"Peanuts\" characters, creating the first Camp Snoopy area and making Snoopy the park's mascot. Knott's expanded its operation in 1992 by building an indoor amusement park in the Mall of America, called \"Knott's Camp Snoopy\". The Knott's theme parks were acquired by the national amusement park chain Cedar Fair LP in 1997, which continued to operate \"Knott's Camp Snoopy\" park until the mall took over its operation in March 2005. Cedar Fair had already licensed the \"Peanuts\" characters for use in 1992 as an atmosphere, so its acquisition of Knott's Berry Farm did not alter the use of those characters. In 2024, Cedar Fair merged with Six Flags, resulting in the latter inheriting the Peanuts characters license.\nSnoopy is currently one of the official mascots of the Six Flags parks, primarily in the former Cedar Fair operated areas. It was previously used in all of the park logos but it has since been removed. Before 2011, Cedar Fair also operated a Camp Snoopy area at Dorney Park &amp; Wildwater Kingdom, Worlds of Fun, and Valleyfair featuring various \"Peanuts\"-themed attractions. There is still a Camp Snoopy area at Cedar Point, Carowinds, Kings Island, Knott's Berry Farm and Michigan's Adventure.\nIn 2008, Cedar Point introduced Planet Snoopy, a children's area where Peanuts Playground used to be. This area consists of family and children's rides relocated from Cedar Point's sister park Geauga Lake after its closing. The rides are inspired by Peanuts characters. In 2010, the Nickelodeon Central and Nickelodeon Universe areas in the former Paramount Parks (California's Great America, Canada's Wonderland, Carowinds, Kings Dominion, and Kings Island) were replaced by Planet Snoopy. In 2011, Cedar Fair announced it would also add Planet Snoopy to Valleyfair, Dorney Park &amp; Wildwater Kingdom, and Worlds of Fun, replacing the Camp Snoopy areas. \u2033Carowinds\u2033 Planet Snoopy was rethemed to Camp Snoopy.\nAlso, the \"Peanuts\" characters can be found at Universal Studios Japan in the Universal Wonderland section along with the characters from \"Sesame Street\" and \"Hello Kitty\", and in the Snoopy's World in Hong Kong.\nExhibition.\nAn exhibition in partnership with the Charles M. Schulz Museum titled \"Good Grief, Charlie Brown! Celebrating Snoopy and the Enduring Power of Peanuts\" opened at Somerset House in London on 25 October 2018, running until 3 March 2019. The exhibition brought together Charles M. Schulz's original Peanuts cartoons with work from a wide range of acclaimed contemporary artists and designers inspired by the cartoon.\nThere is a trail called A Dog's Trail Across Cardiff, Caerphilly and Porthcawl. The trail features Snoopy from Peanuts.\nOwnership.\nOn June 3, 2010, United Media sold all its Peanuts-related assets, including its strips and branding, to a new company, Peanuts Worldwide LLC, a joint venture of the Iconix Brand Group (which owned 80 percent) and Charles M. Schulz Creative Associates (20 percent). In addition, United Media sold its United Media Licensing arm, which represents licensing for its other properties, to Peanuts Worldwide. United Feature Syndicate continued to syndicate the strip, until February 27, 2011, when Universal Uclick took over syndication, ending United Media's 60-plus-year stewardship of Peanuts.\nIn May 2017, Canada-based DHX Media (now WildBrain) announced that it would acquire Iconix's entertainment brands, including the 80% stake of Peanuts Worldwide and full rights to the Strawberry Shortcake brand, for $345\u00a0million. DHX officially took control of the properties on June 30, 2017.\nOn May 13, 2018, DHX announced it had reached a strategic agreement in which Sony Music Entertainment Japan (whose consumer products division has been a licensing agent for the Peanuts brand since 2010) would acquire 49% of its 80% stake in Peanuts Worldwide for $185\u00a0million, with DHX holding a 41% stake and SMEJ owning 39%. The transaction was completed on July 23. Two months after the sale's completion, DHX eliminated the rest of its debt by signing a five-year, multi-million-dollar agency agreement with CAA-GBG Global Brand Management Group (a brand management joint venture between Creative Artists Agency and Hong Kong-based Global Brands Group) to represent the Peanuts brand in China and the rest of Asia excluding Japan.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nBooks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPeriodicals.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOnline.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "42203", "revid": "26217667", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42203", "title": "Vince Guaraldi", "text": "American jazz pianist (1928\u20131976)\nVincent Anthony Guaraldi (; n\u00e9 Dellaglio, July 17, 1928 \u2013 February 6, 1976) was an American jazz pianist best known for composing music for animated television adaptations of the \"Peanuts\" comic strip. His compositions for this series included their signature melody \"Linus and Lucy\" and the holiday standard \"Christmas Time Is Here\". Guaraldi is also known for his performances on piano as a member of Cal Tjader's 1950s ensembles and for his own solo career. Guaraldi's 1962 composition \"Cast Your Fate to the Wind\" became a radio hit and won a Grammy Award in 1963 for Best Original Jazz Composition. He died of a heart attack on February 6, 1976, at age 47, moments after concluding the first half of a nightclub performance in Menlo Park, California.\nEarly life and career.\nVincent Anthony Dellaglio was born in San Francisco's North Beach, a neighborhood that later played a crucial role in his musical development.\nHis surname changed to \"Guaraldi\" after his mother, Carmella (n\u00e9e Marcellino), divorced his biological father, Vincenzo Dellaglio, and remarried Tony Guaraldi, who adopted him. Influenced by his maternal uncles, Joe and Maurice \"Muzzy\" Marcellino (both prominent jazz bandleaders in San Francisco) Guaraldi cultivated an early passion for music. He graduated from Lincoln High School, briefly attended San Francisco State College, and served as a cook in the U.S. Army during the Korean War.\nEarly career and first recordings.\nGuaraldi's first recording was an unreleased 1951 demo with Tom Hart. His official debut occurred in November of the same year with Cal Tjader's Mambo Trio, featuring tracks such as \"Chopsticks Mambo\" and \"Lullaby of the Leaves\", later released in 1953 on \"The Cal Tjader Trio\".\nBy mid-1954, he had formed his first trio with Eddie Duran (guitar) and Dean Reilly (double bass), performing regularly at the hungry i jazz club in San Francisco, often accompanying vocalist Faith Winthrop.\nCollaborations and early albums.\nGuaraldi made his debut as a bandleader in August 1955 during a live session at the Black Hawk, where he recorded original compositions \"Ginza\" and \"Calling Dr. Funk\". These tracks were included in \"Modern Music from San Francisco\", released by Fantasy Records in March 1956. Impressed with his work, Fantasy offered Guaraldi an exclusive contract, leading to the release of his first album, \"Vince Guaraldi Trio\", which featured Duran and Reilly but no drummer. Concurrently, he toured with Woody Herman's Third Herd, delivering dynamic performances that contrasted with his more subdued recordings.\nReuniting with Tjader in 1956, Guaraldi became a key member of two of the vibraphonist's ensembles. The first, focused on straight-ahead jazz, featured Al Torre (drums), Eugene Wright (bass), and Luis Kant (percussion). The second, formed in 1958, incorporated Latin influences and included Al McKibbon (bass), Mongo Santamar\u00eda (congas), Willie Bobo (drums), and reed players Paul Horn and Jos\u00e9 \"Chombo\" Silva for select performances.\nGuaraldi recorded his second album, \"A Flower Is a Lovesome Thing\", in April 1957, again with Duran and Reilly but without a drummer. Released in October 1957, the album struggled commercially, leading Fantasy Records to drop him.\nMainstream success.\nIn early 1959, Guaraldi left his group to focus on solo projects. While he may have remained a respected yet minor jazz figure, his 1962 album \"Jazz Impressions of Black Orpheus\" propelled him to prominence. Initially intended to complement covers of Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim and Luiz Bonf\u00e1 compositions, Guaraldi's original piece, \"Cast Your Fate to the Wind\", unexpectedly gained traction when radio DJs favored it over its A-side, \"Samba de Orpheus\". The song, a gentle and distinctive jazz instrumental, spent 19 weeks on the Top 100 chart, peaking at No. 22, an uncommon achievement for the genre. Guaraldi subsequently won the Grammy Award for Best Original Jazz Composition.\nHe embraced its popularity, remarking, \"It's like signing the back of a check\", and when asked if he had \"sold out\", he countered, \"I feel I bought in\".\nCapitalizing on this success, Fantasy Records released \"In Person\", a live album recorded at The Trident in Sausalito, followed by \"Vince Guaraldi, Bola Sete and Friends\", a collaboration with guitarist Bola Sete. This partnership led Guaraldi to explore bossa nova and the electric piano, gaining further attention through an appearance on Ralph J. Gleason's \"\" and the subsequent release of \"From All Sides\" (1965). A live performance at El Matador in 1965 was later issued as \"Live at El Matador\" (1966).\nIn 1964, Guaraldi experimented with Latin jazz and orchestral arrangements in \"The Latin Side of Vince Guaraldi\", enlisting arranger Jack Weeks. Around this time, Guaraldi was commissioned to compose a jazz-infused mass for San Francisco's Grace Cathedral. Incorporating Latin influences and waltz tempos, the performance was recorded on May 21, 1965, and released as \"At Grace Cathedral\".\nBy 1965, tensions with Fantasy Records escalated when Guaraldi discovered he was receiving only five per cent of record sales, a rate he later described as \"parsimonious\" and sometimes even lower. He initiated legal action to sever ties with Fantasy, prompting a countersuit. In 1967, after Fantasy was acquired by Saul Zaentz, both parties dropped their lawsuits, allowing Guaraldi to become an independent artist. Following the settlement, Guaraldi secured improved financial terms, including 50 per cent of the re-broadcast and publishing royalties for compositions recorded prior to the agreement, and 75 per cent for new works composed thereafter. Royalties were distributed quarterly, with Guaraldi's longtime associate Barry Mineah managing the accounting for the remainder of his career. (Decades later, in 2011, his children sued Fantasy's parent company, Concord Music, alleging financial misrepresentation and unpaid royalties exceeding $2 million between 2005 and 2010.)\nDuring this transitional period, Guaraldi launched his own label, D &amp; D Records, named after his children, David and Dia. In December 1967, he released his sole album under the imprint, \"Vince Guaraldi with the San Francisco Boys Chorus\".\nCompositions for Charles Schulz's \"Peanuts\".\n\"A Boy Named Charlie Brown\" and \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\".\nThe genesis of Guaraldi's association with the \"Peanuts\" franchise began in 1963 when television producer Lee Mendelson, searching for music for a planned \"Peanuts\" documentary titled \"A Boy Named Charlie Brown\", heard \"Cast Your Fate to the Wind\" on the radio. Recognizing its potential, Mendelson sought out Guaraldi, who enthusiastically accepted the offer to compose the documentary's score. Soon after, Guaraldi played an untitled composition over the phone for Mendelson, unable to contain his excitement. That piece, \"Linus and Lucy\", would become the defining musical theme of the \"Peanuts\" franchise. Reflecting on the moment, Mendelson remarked in 2008, \"It just blew me away. It was so right, and so perfect, for Charlie Brown and the other characters. I have no idea why, but I knew that song would affect my entire life. There was a sense, even before it was put to animation, that there was something very, very special about that music.\"\nAlthough the documentary was never aired due to Mendelson\u2019s inability to secure sponsorship, the music was recorded and released in 1964 as \"Jazz Impressions of A Boy Named Charlie Brown\". Encouraged by Guaraldi's work, Mendelson and Schulz retained him for the upcoming \"Peanuts\" holiday special, \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\" (1965). The soundtrack, recorded with the Vince Guaraldi Trio, featured enduring compositions such as \"Christmas Time Is Here\", \"Skating\", \"Christmas Is Coming\", and \"Linus and Lucy\". Both the television special and its soundtrack were immensely successful, establishing Guaraldi as an integral part of the \"Peanuts\" legacy.\nGuaraldi historian Derrick Bang underscored Guaraldi's impact, stating, \"Rarely has an entertainment icon been so quickly\u2014and firmly\u2014welded to a musical composition...Guaraldi defined the \"Peanuts\" sound, and it's just as true today as it was in the 1960s. The compositions themselves are uniformly sparkling; it's as if the jazz pianist and his trio were waiting for this precise inspiration\". Mendelson concurred, highlighting Guaraldi's jazz score as essential to \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\"'s widespread appeal. \"There's no doubt in my mind that if we hadn't had that Guaraldi score, we wouldn't have had the franchise we later enjoyed.\" Despite Guaraldi's inexperience in scoring and Mendelson\u2019s documentary background, their shared affinity for jazz facilitated a meticulous, iterative process of reviewing and refining each cue\u2014a method they applied across sixteen specials. While some material was repurposed or omitted, most of Guaraldi's compositions remained integral to the final productions.\n\"It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown\".\nFollowing the unexpected success of \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\", the creative team produced another special, \"Charlie Brown's All Stars!\" (1966), which was also well received. With confidence in their ability to replicate their initial success, Schulz, Mendelson, and animator Bill Melendez set their sights on another holiday-themed special, \"It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown\" (1966).\nGuaraldi composed the score throughout the summer of 1966, advocating for \"Linus and Lucy\" to become the franchise's unofficial theme. Recognizing this oversight in \"Charlie Brown's All Stars!\", he ensured that the piece was featured prominently in \"It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown\". Melendez responded by structuring the special's opening sequence around a dialogue-free montage, accompanied solely by Guaraldi's music. This version of \"Linus and Lucy\", recorded with a sextet that included bassist Monty Budwig, drummer Colin Bailey, trumpeter Emmanuel Klein, guitarist John Gray, and flautist Ronnie Lang, became the definitive rendition of the piece and solidified its place as the \"Peanuts\" musical identity.\nGuaraldi continued composing for \"Peanuts\", scoring twelve additional animated television specials, as well as the feature film \"A Boy Named Charlie Brown\" and the documentary \"Charlie Brown and Charles Schulz\" (both 1969).\nLater years and artistic evolution.\nAfter nearly two years of navigating legal and contractual complexities to extricate himself from his agreement with Fantasy Records, Guaraldi signed with Warner Bros.-Seven Arts in 1968. His first release under the new label, \"Oh Good Grief!\", featured reimagined renditions of eight of his most popular \"Peanuts\" compositions. His subsequent 1969 albums, \"The Eclectic Vince Guaraldi\" and \"Alma-Ville\", marked a departure from his earlier work, incorporating jazz fusion, electric keyboards, and more avant-garde styles. However, these experimental efforts received mixed critical and commercial reception, leading Warner Bros.-Seven Arts to decline a contract renewal.\nFollowing his work on the \"Peanuts\" feature film \"A Boy Named Charlie Brown\" and the release of \"Alma-Ville\", Guaraldi was unable to secure a new recording contract. Industry colleagues recalled that he had amassed several hours of unreleased studio material during this period, enough for at least two full albums, but ongoing disputes with record label executives and broader estrangements within the recording industry left him without viable institutional support. With fewer opportunities in the commercial recording sphere, he ceased releasing new material and redirected his focus toward live performances and television scoring. His later work blended jazz, rock, and funk, frequently featuring the Hammond B-3 and Fender Rhodes electric keyboards. His scores for \"A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving\" (1973) and \"You're a Good Sport, Charlie Brown\" (1975) incorporated elements of funk and disco, reflecting the shifting musical trends of the era. Beginning in late 1974 with the recording of the score to \"Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown\" (1975), he further expanded his sound with the use of the ARP String Ensemble synthesizer.\nAs rock 'n' roll surged in the 1960s, leading to the decline of jazz clubs and job losses for many jazz musicians, Guaraldi adapted by incorporating electric keyboards into his style rather than resisting the changing musical landscape. Despite shifting musical trends, Guaraldi remained a respected figure in the Northern California jazz scene.\nFinancially secure from \"Peanuts\" royalties, Guaraldi chose to remain in Mill Valley, California, performing at local clubs rather than seeking broader fame. Mendelson recalled, \"Once the \"Peanuts\" music became famous, Vince could have gone out and done a whole lot more, but he was very provincial. He loved San Francisco, and he liked hanging out and playing at the local clubs.\"\nDeath and impact.\nGuaraldi suffered a fatal heart attack on February 6, 1976, at the age of 47. The night before, he dined at Lee Mendelson's home and complained of chest discomfort resembling indigestion. Guaraldi had recently consulted a doctor, who suspected a diaphragmatic hernia, and had also sought medical attention for persistent stomach issues. However, he was prescribed medication for ulcers and dismissed without further examination.\nOn the morning of February 6, Guaraldi awoke feeling unwell and remained in bed. That afternoon, he completed his recording sessions for \"It's Arbor Day, Charlie Brown\" at Wally Heider Studios in San Francisco, alongside bassist Seward McCain and drummer Jim Zimmerman. Zimmerman recalled that although Guaraldi had recently been active, even skiing during a mountain concert trip, he began complaining of stomach pain once back in the studio.\nThat evening, after concluding the first set at Butterfield's Nightclub in Menlo Park, California, with his interpretation of the Beatles' \"Eleanor Rigby\", Guaraldi returned to his lodging at the adjacent Red Cottage Inn to rest before the next set. While in his room with Zimmerman, he collapsed while attempting to go to the bathroom. Attempts to revive him failed, and he was pronounced dead on arrival at Stanford Hospital at 11:07\u00a0p.m. Reflecting on Guaraldi\u2019s sudden passing, Zimmerman remarked in 2009, \"It is very romantic to think of someone going out just after they play. I wish he hadn't.\"\nFriends and colleagues later speculated that Guaraldi's persistent stomach pain may have been a sign of a more serious, undiagnosed condition, suggesting that an abdominal aortic aneurysm or another undetected ailment may have contributed to his heart attack.\nGuaraldi's death deeply affected those who knew him. Mendelson described it as \"totally unexpected\" and recalled the emotional impact of hearing \"Peanuts\" music played at the funeral, as requested by Guaraldi's mother, Carmella. \"It was not an easy day; he was so young,\" said Mendelson. \"It was one of the saddest days of my life\". Bill Melendez simply stated, \"He was a real good guy, and we miss him\".\nDrummer Mike Clark remembered being shocked by the news, as Guaraldi had always seemed full of energy and opportunity. \"I was in New York, and Vince Lateano told me. It was the last thing I could think of, that Guaraldi would die\". Rev. Charles Gompertz, who had invited Guaraldi to perform at Grace Cathedral in 1965, reflected that Guaraldi never prioritized his health, often pushing himself to extremes both musically and physically. His mother later remarked that he passed the way he would have wanted\u2014\"with the piano\".\nGuaraldi's funeral was held at Our Lady of Mercy Catholic Church in Daly City, California, and he was laid to rest at Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma.\nPersonal life.\nGuaraldi married his high school sweetheart, Shirley Moskowitz, on February 1, 1953. Their marriage produced two children, David Anthony Guaraldi (b. August 11, 1955) and Dia Lisa (b. February 16, 1960). Moskowitz initially filed for divorce on April 21, 1966, but later withdrew the petition. A second filing in June 1968 was finalized on December 8, 1970.\nGuaraldi maintained a long-term relationship with Gretchen Glanzer (later Katamay), who appeared on the cover of \"The Latin Side of Vince Guaraldi\". The two were also photographed together on the back cover of the Grateful Dead's 1969 album \"Aoxomoxoa\", among friends of the band.\nGuaraldi was a practicing Catholic.\nRevival, rediscovery, and posthumous releases.\nDespite Guaraldi's pivotal role in shaping \"Peanuts\" music, only three albums containing the music\u2014\"Jazz Impressions of A Boy Named Charlie Brown\", \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\", and \"Oh Good Grief!\" (featuring reimagined versions of his compositions)\u2014were released during his lifetime. The broader dissemination of his \"Peanuts\" work was hindered by the uncertain status of his original studio recordings, many of which were believed lost or misfiled after his passing, limiting commercial opportunities. Additionally, while \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\" was recorded in stereo for commercial distribution, the \"Peanuts\" television specials of the 1960s were produced in monaural sound, restricting their suitability for independent release.\nInterest in Guaraldi's oeuvre resurged in 1985 with David Benoit's rendition of \"Linus and Lucy\" on \"This Side Up\", reintroducing the distinctive sound of the \"Peanuts\" television specials to new audiences. This revival continued with tribute albums such as \"Happy Anniversary, Charlie Brown!\" (1989), Wynton Marsalis's \"Joe Cool's Blues\" (1995), and Cyrus Chestnut Christmas-themed recordings. By 1996, \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\" had achieved double-platinum status, with sales increasing after Concord Records acquired Fantasy Records in 2004.\nNew Age pianist George Winston further contributed to Guaraldi's resurgence with ' (1996), a solo piano tribute that included previously unreleased \"Peanuts\" compositions. Winston, who cited Guaraldi as a key influence, stated, \"I love his melodies and his chord progressions. He has a deeply personal way of voicing chords\". He added, \"His music is part of our culture, and we know it even if we don't know Vince. He had three bags: the Latin, the \"Peanuts\", and the impressionistic 'Cast Your Fate to the Wind' stuff. And those three bags are all his\". The album's success led to a second volume, ' (2010), and a planned third volume, \"Count the Ways: The Music of Vince Guaraldi, Volume 3\", unreleased following Winston's passing in June 2023.\nIn response to renewed interest, Guaraldi's son, David Guaraldi, began licensing unreleased material from his father's personal reel-to-reel tapes. This effort led to several archival releases, including \"The Charlie Brown Suite &amp; Other Favorites\" (2003), \"Oaxaca\" (2004), \"North Beach\" (2006), \"Vince Guaraldi and the Lost Cues from the Charlie Brown Television Specials\" (Volumes 1 and 2, 2007-2008), \"Live on the Air\" (2008) and \"An Afternoon with the Vince Guaraldi Quartet\" (2011). These releases offered deeper insight into Guaraldi's extensive yet under-documented body of work. However, the absence of a formal recording contract and his limited engagement with the industry resulted in a fragmented catalog. His decision not to tour further diminished institutional interest in preserving his music. Additionally, while widely celebrated by audiences, his \"Peanuts\" compositions were often regarded by jazz purists as overly commercial, which contributed to the industry's lack of urgency in cataloging and promoting his television soundtracks.\nA significant breakthrough in archival efforts occurred in 2017 with the rediscovery of Guaraldi's original master recordings for the 1969 feature film \"\". This led to Concord's 2018 announcement of a long-awaited \"It\u2019s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown\" soundtrack release under its Craft Recordings reissue label. However, as the original master tapes remained missing, the album had to be sourced from television broadcast audio, leading to some disappointment.\nDuring the COVID-19 lockdown, following Lee Mendelson's passing in December 2019, his children discovered the original 1966 analog session reels, which contained nearly all of Guaraldi's original music cues and alternate takes. This discovery enabled a more complete 2022 re-release of \"It's the Great Pumpkin...\", followed by remastered soundtracks produced by Jason and Sean Mendelson for \"A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving\" (2023), \"It Was a Short Summer...\", \"You're Not Elected...\" (both 2024), \"Be My Valentine...\", \"It's the Easter Beagle...\", and \"You're a Good Sport...\" (all 2025) on the Lee Mendelson Film Productions label. \"The Peanuts Collection, Vol. 1\" was released on October 17, 2025, as a limited edition box set compiling all six Lee Mendelson Film Productions-issued remasters in chronological order (\"It's the Great Pumpkin...\" was not included, as it remains under the Craft Recordings imprint). The availability of these materials addressed longstanding archival limitations that had previously hindered broader distribution of Guaraldi's \"Peanuts\" music. While most of his 1960s scores were recorded in mono for television broadcast, many of his later 1970s compositions were tracked in stereo, making them more suitable for modern remastering and commercial release.\nCapitalizing on renewed interest in Guaraldi's music sparked by the Mendelsons' discovery of numerous \"Peanuts\" soundtrack recordings, Craft launched a series of deluxe reissues beginning in 2022. These included \"Jazz Impressions of Black Orpheus\" and a five-disc edition of \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\", whose frequent vinyl reissues highlight its enduring appeal. An expanded edition of \"Jazz Impressions of A Boy Named Charlie Brown\" was released in April 2025.\nRecognition and cultural impact.\nOn November 18, 2021, \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\" was ranked as the No. 1 Greatest Holiday 200 Album of All Time by \"Billboard\". In May 2022, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album quintuple platinum, recognizing sales exceeding five million copies. This achievement established it as the second-best-selling jazz album of all time, surpassed only by Miles Davis's \"Kind of Blue\" (1959).\nLegacy.\nThe revival of Vince Guaraldi's music has been driven by tribute albums, archival rediscoveries, and growing recognition of his contributions to the \"Peanuts\" franchise, which established a musical identity that was both sophisticated and widely accessible. Although the absence of a formal recording contract, misplaced master tapes, and skepticism within the jazz community initially impeded preservation efforts, dedicated archival work and sustained public enthusiasm have ensured the survival of his compositions. Guaraldi's \"Peanuts\" scores remain among the most recognizable and influential works in television music history. His distinctive blend of jazz and lighthearted melodies became inseparable from Charles M. Schulz's iconic characters, shaping the franchise's sound for generations. With ongoing restoration projects and scheduled releases through 2025, Guaraldi's legacy remains deeply embedded in both jazz and popular culture.\nLee Mendelson reflected on Guaraldi's influence, remarking, \"Several generations have now grown up with Vince Guaraldi's music. If people hear just one or two bass notes of the intro to 'Linus and Lucy,' they cheer. The \"Peanuts\" programs and Vince's music were such a wonderful marriage. It's a shame it got cut off so soon.\"\nA book-length biography of Guaraldi, titled \"Vince Guaraldi at the Piano\" by author and Guaraldi archivist Derrick Bang, was originally published in March 2012, with a second edition released in May 2024. The biography chronicles Guaraldi's career and his contributions to the Northern California jazz scene, and includes a comprehensive discography and filmography, along with an appendix of quotations from Guaraldi's former sidemen.\nIn the original 1964 liner notes for \"Jazz Impressions of A Boy Named Charlie Brown\", Ralph J. Gleason observed that while self-expression is fundamental to art, a greater challenge lies in interpreting and responding to another artist's work while preserving one's own creative identity. He credited Guaraldi with successfully achieving this in his \"Peanuts\" compositions, noting that Guaraldi effectively translated Charles M. Schulz's artistic vision into music that was both empathetic to the imagery and unmistakably his own.\nIn his review of \"The Definitive Vince Guaraldi\" (2009), \"All About Jazz\" critic David Rickert credited Guaraldi with introducing many listeners to jazz, often before they consciously recognized the genre. Rickert highlighted Guaraldi's \"Peanuts\" television soundtracks as an innovative approach to cartoon scoring that seamlessly complemented the sophisticated yet accessible narratives of \"Peanuts\". He further praised Guaraldi's original compositions as among the finest jazz works to emerge from the West Coast scene, attributing their success to the fusion of artistic inspiration and compositional talent.\nDocumentary.\nThe 2010 documentary \"The Anatomy of Vince Guaraldi\" premiered at various jazz and film festivals, showcasing newly discovered and restored footage of Guaraldi\u2019s performances and recording sessions. The film featured new interpretations and commentary from artists including George Winston, Dave Brubeck, Dick Gregory, Jon Hendricks, Leonard Maltin, and Paul Krassner, as well as surviving Guaraldi collaborators Eddie Duran, Dean Reilly, and Jerry Granelli. Co-produced by Toby Gleason (son of Ralph J. Gleason) and filmmaker Andrew Thomas, the documentary received five \"Best Documentary\" awards and was a featured presentation at the Library of Congress and the Monterey Jazz Festival. Reflecting on Guaraldi's influence, Gleason remarked, \"Let\u2019s just agree that Vince Guaraldi re-invented the sound of the modern American Christmas.\"\nSidemen and trio configurations.\nThroughout his career, Guaraldi collaborated with a diverse array of sidemen, though he primarily favored performing in a trio. The ensemble occasionally expanded to accommodate specific musical demands, including live performances and \"Peanuts\" soundtracks. His largest recorded ensemble appeared in 1969 for the soundtracks of \"It Was a Short Summer, Charlie Brown\" (decet) and \"A Boy Named Charlie Brown\" (septet).\nFor bass and double bass, Guaraldi regularly worked with Monty Budwig, Dean Reilly, Fred Marshall, and Tom Beeson throughout the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1970s, he primarily performed with Seward McCain, alongside occasional collaborations with Koji Kataoka.\nGuitarist Eddie Duran was a frequent collaborator during the 1950s and 1960s, except between 1963 and 1965, when Guaraldi partnered with guitarist Bola Sete in a dual act. In the 1970s, Guaraldi occasionally played guitar himself but did not maintain a dedicated guitarist.\nGuaraldi's first two albums were recorded without a drummer. From 1961 onward, Colin Bailey assumed the role, followed by Jerry Granelli. During the 1970s, Mike Clark became Guaraldi's primary drummer for live performances. Other drummers included Lee Charlton, John Rae, Al Coster, Eliot Zigmund, Glenn Cronkhite, Vince Lateano, Mark Rosengarden, and Jim Zimmerman.\nThe original Vince Guaraldi Trio featured Dean Reilly (bass) and Eddie Duran (guitar) and appeared on his first two albums. The first of two \"classic\" trio configurations included Monty Budwig (bass) and Colin Bailey (drums), performing on \"Jazz Impressions of Black Orpheus\" and \"Jazz Impressions of A Boy Named Charlie Brown\". The second \"classic\" trio, featuring Fred Marshall (double bass) and Jerry Granelli (drums), recorded more albums than any other iteration, including \"Vince Guaraldi, Bola Sete and Friends\", \"\", \"The Latin Side of Vince Guaraldi\", \"From All Sides\", and \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\".\nDiscography.\nAs leader/co-leader.\nAdditional sources:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "42206", "revid": "10059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42206", "title": "Western Christianity", "text": "Religious category of the Latin Church, Protestantism, and their derivatives\nWestern Christianity is one of two subdivisions of Christianity (Eastern Christianity being the other). Western Christianity is composed of the Latin Church and Western Protestantism, together with their offshoots such as the Old Catholic Church, Independent Catholicism and Restorationism.\nThe large majority of the world's 2.3\u00a0billion Christians are Western Christians (about 2\u00a0billion: 1.3\u00a0billion Latin Catholic and 1.17 billion Protestant). One major component, the Latin Church, developed under the bishop of Rome. Out of the Latin Church emerged a wide variety of independent Protestant denominations, including Lutheranism and Anglicanism, starting from the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, as did Independent Catholicism in the 19th century. Thus, the term \"Western Christianity\" does not describe a single communion or religious denomination but is applied to distinguish all these denominations collectively from Eastern Christianity.\nThe establishment of the distinct Latin Church, a particular church \"sui iuris\" of the Catholic Church, coincided with the consolidation of the Holy See in Rome, which claimed primacy since Antiquity. The Latin Church is distinct from the Eastern Catholic Churches, also in full communion with the Pope in Rome, and from the Eastern Orthodox Church and Oriental Orthodox Churches, which are not in communion with Rome. These other churches are part of Eastern Christianity. The terms \"Western\" and \"Eastern\" in this regard originated with geographical divisions mirroring the cultural divide between the Hellenistic East and Latin West and the political divide between the Western and Eastern Roman empires. During the Middle Ages, adherents of the Latin Church, irrespective of ethnicity, commonly referred to themselves as \"Latins\" to distinguish themselves from Eastern Christians (\"Greeks\").\nWestern Christianity has played a prominent role in the shaping of Western civilization. With the expansion of European colonialism from the Early Modern era, the Latin Church, in time along with its Protestant secessions, spread throughout the Americas, much of the Philippines, Southern Africa, pockets of West Africa, and throughout Australia and New Zealand. Thus, when used for historical periods after the 16th century, the term \"Western Christianity\" does not refer to a particular geographical area but is used as a collective term for all these.\nToday, the geographical distinction between Western and Eastern Christianity is not nearly as absolute as in Antiquity or the Middle Ages, due to the spread of Christian missionaries, migrations, and globalisation. As such, the adjectives \"Western Christianity\" and \"Eastern Christianity\" are typically used to refer to historical origins and differences in theology and liturgy rather than present geographical locations.\nWhile the Latin Church maintains the use of the Latin liturgical rites, Protestant denominations and Independent Catholicism use various liturgical practices.\nThe earliest concept of Europe as a cultural sphere (instead of simply a geographic term) appeared during the Carolingian Renaissance of the 9th century, which included territories that practiced Western Christianity at the time.\nMajor in Christianity:&lt;br&gt;\n\"Western Christianity\" \n\"Eastern Christianity\" \nProtestantism\nAnabaptism \nAnglicanism \nLutheranism \nReformed \n(Latin Church) \nCatholic Church\n(Eastern Catholic Churches) \nEastern Orthodox Church\nOriental Orthodox Churches\nChurch of the East\nSchism \"(1552)\"\nAssyrian Church of the East \nAncient Church of the East \nProtestant Reformation\n\"(16th century)\"\nGreat Schism \"(1054)\"\nNestorian Schism \"(431)\"\nChalcedonian Schism \"(451)\"\n\"Early Christianity\" \n\"Great Church\"\n(Full communion) \n(Not shown are ante-Nicene, nontrinitarian, and restorationist denominations.)\nHistory.\nFor much of its history, the Christian church has been culturally divided between the Latin-speaking West, whose centre was Rome, and the Greek-speaking East, whose centre was Constantinople. Cultural differences and political rivalry created tensions between the two churches, leading to disagreement over doctrine and ecclesiology and ultimately to schism.\nLike Eastern Christianity, Western Christianity traces its roots directly to the apostles and other early preachers of the religion. In Western Christianity's original area, Latin was the principal language. Christian writers in Latin had more influence there than those who wrote in Greek, Syriac, or other languages. Although the first Christians in the West used Greek (such as Clement of Rome), by the fourth century Latin had superseded it even in the cosmopolitan city of Rome, as well as in southern Gaul and the Roman province of Africa. There is evidence of a Latin translation of the Bible as early as the 2nd century (see also Vetus Latina).\nWith the decline of the Roman Empire, distinctions appeared also in organization, since the bishops in the West were not dependent on the Emperor in Constantinople and did not come under the influence of the Caesaropapism in the Eastern Church. While the see of Constantinople became dominant throughout the Emperor's lands, the West looked exclusively to the see of Rome, which in the East was seen as that of one of the five patriarchs of the Pentarchy, \"the proposed government of universal Christendom by five patriarchal sees under the auspices of a single universal empire. Formulated in the legislation of the emperor Justinian I (527\u2013565), especially in his Novella 131, the theory received formal ecclesiastical sanction at the Council in Trullo (692), which ranked the five sees as Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem.\"\nOver the centuries, disagreements separated Western Christianity from the various forms of Eastern Christianity: first from East Syriac Christianity after the Council of Ephesus (431), then from that of Oriental Orthodoxy after the Council of Chalcedon (451), and then from Eastern Orthodoxy with the East-West Schism of 1054. With the last-named form of Eastern Christianity, reunion agreements were signed at the Second Council of Lyon (1274) and the Council of Florence (1439), but these proved ineffective.\nHistorian Paul Legutko of Stanford University said the Catholic Church is \"at the center of the development of the values, ideas, science, laws, and institutions which constitute what we call Western civilization\". The rise of Protestantism led to major divisions within Western Christianity, which still persist, and wars\u2014for example, the Anglo-Spanish War of 1585\u20131604 had religious as well as economic causes.\nIn and after the Age of Discovery, Europeans spread Western Christianity to the New World and elsewhere. Roman Catholicism came to the Americas (especially South America), Africa, Asia, Australia and the Pacific. Protestantism, including Anglicanism, came to North America, Australia-Pacific and some African locales.\nToday, the geographical distinction between Western and Eastern Christianity is much less absolute, due to the great migrations of Europeans across the globe, as well as the work of missionaries worldwide over the past five centuries. \nFeatures.\nOriginal sin.\nOriginal sin, also called ancestral sin, is a Christian belief in a state of sin in which humanity has existed since the fall of man, stemming from Adam and Eve's rebellion in the Garden of Eden, namely the sin of disobedience in consuming the forbidden fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Theologians have characterized this condition in many ways, seeing it as ranging from something as insignificant as a slight deficiency, or a tendency toward sin yet without collective guilt, referred to as a \"sin nature\", to something as drastic as total depravity or automatic guilt of all humans through collective guilt.\nFilioque clause.\nMost Western Christians use a version of the Nicene Creed that states that the Holy Spirit \"proceeds from the Father and the Son\", where the original text as adopted by the First Council of Constantinople had \"proceeds from the Father\" without the addition of either \"and the Son\" or \"alone\". This Western version also has the additional phrase \"God from God\" (), which was in the Creed as adopted by the First Council of Nicaea, but which was dropped by the First Council of Constantinople.\nDate of Easter.\nThe date of Easter usually differs between Eastern and Western Christianity, because the calculations are based on the Julian calendar and Gregorian calendar respectively. However, before the Council of Nicea, various dates including Jewish Passover were observed. Nicea \"Romanized\" the date for Easter and anathematized a \"Judaized\" (i.e. Passover date for) Easter. The date of observance of Easter has only differed in modern times since the promulgation of the Gregorian calendar in 1582; and further, the Western Church did not universally adopt the Gregorian calendar at once, so that for some time the dates of Easter differed between the Eastern Church and the Roman Catholic Church, but not necessarily as between the Eastern Church and the Western Protestant churches. For example, the Church of England continued to observe Easter on the same date as the Eastern Church until 1753.\nEven the dates of other Christian holidays often differ between Eastern and Western Christianity.\nLack of essence\u2013energies distinction.\nEastern Christianity, and particularly the Eastern Orthodox Church, has traditionally held a distinction between God's essence, or that which He is, with God's energies, or that which He does. They hold that while God is unknowable in His essence, He can be known (i.e. experienced) in His energies. This is an extension of Eastern Christianity's apophatic theology, while Western Christians tend to prefer a view of divine simplicity, and claim that God's essence can be known by its attributes.\nWestern denominations.\nToday, Western Christianity makes up close to 90% of Christians worldwide with the Catholic Church accounting for over half and various Protestant denominations making up another 40%.\nHussite movements of 15th century Bohemia preceded the main Protestant uprising by 100 years and evolved into several small Protestant churches, such as the Moravian Church. Waldensians survived also, but blended into the Reformed tradition.\nMajor figures.\nBishop of Rome or the pope.\nRelevant figures:\nThe Reformers.\nRelevant figures:\nArchbishop of Canterbury and primate of all England.\nRelevant figures:\nArchbishop of Lyon and primate of the Gauls.\nRelevant figures:\nPatriarch of Aquileia.\nRelevant figures:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "42207", "revid": "47179870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42207", "title": "Eastern Christianity", "text": "Christian traditions originating from Greek- and Syriac-speaking populations\nEastern Christianity comprises Christian traditions and church families that originally developed during classical and late antiquity in the Eastern Mediterranean region or locations further east, south or north. The term does not describe a single communion or religious denomination. Eastern Christianity is a category distinguished from Western Christianity, which is composed of those Christian traditions and churches that originally developed further west.\nMajor Eastern Christian bodies include the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Oriental Orthodox Churches, along with those groups descended from the historic Church of the East (also called the Assyrian Church), as well as the Eastern Catholic Churches (which are in communion with Rome while maintaining Eastern liturgies), and the Eastern Protestant churches. Most Eastern churches do not normally refer to themselves as \"Eastern\", with the exception of the Assyrian Church of the East and its offshoot, the Ancient Church of the East.\nThe Eastern Orthodox are the largest body within Eastern Christianity with a worldwide population of 220 million, followed by the Oriental Orthodox at 60 million. The Eastern Catholic Churches consist of about 16\u201318 million and are a small minority within the Catholic Church. Eastern Protestant Christian churches do not form a single communion; churches like the Ukrainian Lutheran Church and the Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church have under a million members. The Assyrian Church of the East and the Ancient Church of the East, descendant churches of the Assyria-based Church of the East, have a combined membership of approximately 400,000.\nHistorically, Eastern Christianity was centered in the Middle East and surrounding areas, where Christianity originated. However, after the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 7th century, the term Eastern Church increasingly came to be used for the Greek Church centered in Constantinople, in contrast with the (\"Western\") Latin Church, centered on Rome, which uses the Latin liturgical rites. The terms \"Eastern\" and \"Western\" in this regard originated with geographical divisions in Christianity mirroring the cultural divide between the Hellenistic East and the Latin West, and the political divide of 395 AD between the Western and Eastern Roman Empires. Since the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century, the term \"Eastern Christianity\" may be used in contrast with \"Western Christianity\", which contains not only the Latin Church but also forms of Protestantism and Independent Catholicism. Some Eastern churches have more in common historically and theologically with Western Christianity than with one another.\nBecause the largest church in the East is the body currently known as the Eastern Orthodox Church, the term \"Orthodox\" is often used in a similar fashion to \"Eastern\", to refer to specific historical Christian communions. However, strictly speaking, most Christian denominations, whether Eastern or Western, regard themselves as \"orthodox\" (meaning \"following correct beliefs\") as well as \"catholic\" (meaning \"universal\"), and as sharing in the Four Marks of the Church listed in the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed (381 AD): \"One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic\" ().\nEastern churches (excepting the non-liturgical dissenting bodies) utilize several liturgical rites: the Alexandrian Rite, the Armenian Rite, the Byzantine Rite, the East Syriac Rite (also known as Persian or Assyrian Rite), and the West Syriac Rite (also called the Antiochian Rite).\nFamilies of churches.\nEastern Christians do not all share the same religious traditions, but many do share cultural traditions. Christianity divided itself in the East during its early centuries both within and outside of the Roman Empire in disputes about Christology and fundamental theology, as well as through national divisions (Roman, Persian, etc.). It would be many centuries later that Western Christianity fully split from these traditions as its own communion. Major branches or families of Eastern Christianity, each holding a distinct theology and dogma, include the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox communion, the Eastern Catholic Churches and the Assyrian Church of the East.\nIn most Eastern churches, parish priests administer the sacrament of chrismation to infants after baptism, and priests are allowed to marry before ordination. The Eastern Catholic Churches recognize the authority of the Pope of Rome, but some of them who have originally been part of the Orthodox Church or Oriental Orthodox churches closely follow the traditions of Orthodoxy or Oriental Orthodoxy, including the tradition of allowing married men to become priests.\nThe Eastern churches' differences from Western Christianity have to do with theology, as well as liturgy, culture, language, and politics. For the non-Catholic Eastern churches, a definitive date for the commencement of schism cannot usually be given (see East\u2013West Schism). The Church of the East declared independence from the churches of the Roman Empire at its general council in 424, which was before the Council of Ephesus in 431, and so had nothing to do with the theology declared at that council. Oriental Orthodoxy separated after the Council of Chalcedon in 451 but did not immediately form separate patriarchates until 518 (in the case of the Syriac Patriarchate of Antioch) and 536 (in the case of the Coptic Patriarchate of Alexandria).\nSince the time of the historian Edward Gibbon, the split between the Church of Rome and the Orthodox Church has been conveniently dated to 1054, though the reality is more complex. This split is sometimes referred to as the \"Great Schism\", but is now more usually called the East\u2013West Schism. This final schism reflected a larger cultural and political division which had developed in Europe and Southwest Asia during the Middle Ages and coincided with Western Europe's re-emergence from the collapse of the Western Roman Empire.\nThe Ukrainian Lutheran Church developed within Galicia around 1926, with its rites being based on the Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom, rather than on the Western \"Formula Missae\".\nEastern Orthodox Church.\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church is a Christian body whose adherents are largely based in Western Asia (particularly Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, and Palestine) and Turkey, Eastern Europe, the Balkans and the Caucasus (Georgia), with a growing presence in the Western world. Eastern Orthodox Christians accept the decisions of the first seven ecumenical councils.\nEastern Orthodox Christianity identifies itself as the original Christian church (see early centers of Christianity) founded by Christ and the Apostles, and traces its lineage back to the early Church through the process of apostolic succession and unchanged theology and practice. Characteristics of the Eastern Orthodox Church include the Byzantine Rite (shared with some Eastern Catholic Churches) and an emphasis on the continuation of Holy Tradition, which it holds to be apostolic in nature.\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church is organized into self-governing jurisdictions along geographical, national, ethnic or linguistic lines. Eastern Orthodoxy is thus made up of fourteen or sixteen autocephalous bodies. Smaller churches are autonomous and each have a mother church that is autocephalous.\nAll Eastern Orthodox are united in doctrinal agreement with each other, though a few are not in communion at present, for non-doctrinal reasons. This is in contrast to the Catholic Church and its various churches. Members of the latter are all in communion with each other, parts of a top-down hierarchy (see ). The Eastern Orthodox reject the Filioque clause as contrast to Catholics. The Catholic Church was once in communion with the Eastern Orthodox Church, but the two split after the East\u2013West Schism and are no longer in communion.\nIt is estimated that there are approximately 240\u00a0million Eastern Orthodox Christians in the world. Today, many adherents shun the term \"Eastern\" as denying the church's universal character. They refer to Eastern Orthodoxy simply as the \"Orthodox Church\".\nOriental Orthodoxy.\nOriental Orthodoxy refers to the churches of Eastern Christian tradition that keep the faith of the first three ecumenical councils of the undivided Christian Church: the First Council of Nicaea (AD 325), the First Council of Constantinople (381) and the Council of Ephesus (431), while rejecting the dogmatic definitions of the Council of Chalcedon (451). Hence, these churches are also called the \"Old Oriental churches\". They comprise the Coptic Orthodox Church, the Malankara Orthodox Church (India), the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Syriac Orthodox Church and the Armenian Apostolic Church.\nOriental Orthodoxy developed in reaction to Chalcedon on the eastern limit of the Byzantine Empire and in Egypt, Syria and Mesopotamia. In those locations, there are also Eastern Orthodox patriarchs, but the rivalry between the two has largely vanished in the centuries since the schism.\nChurch of the East.\nHistorically, the Church of the East was the widest reaching branch of Eastern Christianity, at its height spreading from its heartland in Persian-ruled Assyria to the Mediterranean, India, and China. Originally the only Christian church recognized by Zoroastrian-led Sassanid Persia (through its alliance with the Lakhmids, the regional rivals to the Byzantines and its Ghassanid vassal), the Church of the East declared itself independent of other churches in 424 and over the next century became affiliated with Nestorianism, a Christological doctrine advanced by Nestorius, Patriarch of Constantinople from 428 to 431, which had been declared heretical in the Roman Empire. Thereafter it was often known in the West, possibly inaccurately, as the Nestorian Church. Surviving a period of persecution within Persia, the Church of the East flourished under the Abbasid Caliphate and branched out, establishing dioceses throughout Asia. After another period of expansion under the Mongol Empire, the church went into decline starting in the 14th century, and was eventually largely confined to its founding Assyrian adherent's heartland in the Assyrian homeland, although another remnant survived on the Malabar Coast of India.\nIn the 16th century, dynastic struggles sent the church into schism, resulting in the formation of two rival churches: The Chaldean Catholic Church, which entered into communion with Rome as an Eastern Catholic Church, and the Assyrian Church of the East. The followers of these two churches are almost exclusively ethnic Assyrians. In India, the local Church of the East community, known as the Saint Thomas Christians, experienced its own rifts as a result of Portuguese influence.\nAssyrian Church of the East.\nThe Assyrian Church of the East emerged from the historical Church of the East, which was centered in Mesopotamia/Assyria, then part of the Persian Empire, and spread widely throughout Asia. The modern Assyrian Church of the East emerged in the 16th century following a split with the Chaldean Church, which later entered into communion with Rome as an Eastern Catholic Church.\nThe Church of the East was associated with the doctrine of Nestorianism, advanced by Nestorius, Patriarch of Constantinople from 428 to 431, which emphasized the disunion between the human and divine natures of Jesus. Nestorius and his doctrine were condemned at the Council of Ephesus in 431, leading to the Nestorian Schism in which churches supporting Nestorius split from the rest of Christianity.\nMany followers relocated to Persia and became affiliated with the local Christian community there. This community adopted an increasingly Nestorian theology and was thereafter often known as the Nestorian Church. As such, the Church of the East accepts only the first two ecumenical councils of the undivided Church\u2014the First Council of Nicaea and the First Council of Constantinople\u2014as defining its faith tradition, and rapidly took a different course from other Eastern Christians.\nThe Church of the East spread widely through Persia and into Asia, being introduced to India by the 6th century and to the Mongols and China in the 7th century. It experienced periodic expansion until the 14th century, when the church was nearly destroyed by the collapse of the Mongol Empire and the conquests of Timur. By the 16th century it was largely confined to Iraq, northeast Syria, southeast Turkey, northwest Iran and the Malabar Coast of India (Kerala). The split of the 15th century, which saw the emergence of separate Assyrian and Chaldean Churches, left only the former as an independent sect. Additional splits into the 20th century further affected the history of the Assyrian Church of the East.\nSaint Thomas Syrian Christians.\nThe Saint Thomas Syrian Christians are an ancient body of Syrian Christians in Kerala, Malabar coast of India who trace their origins to the evangelical activity of Thomas the Apostle in the 1st century. Many Assyrian and Jewish communities like the Knanaya and the Cochin Jews assimilated into the Saint Thomas Syrian Christian community. By the 5th century the Saint Thomas Syrian Christians were part of the Church of the East (Nestorian Church). Until the middle of the 17th century and the arrival of the Portuguese, the Thomas Christians were all one in faith and rite. Thereafter, divisions arose among them, and consequently they are today of several different rites. The East Syriac Chaldean Rite (Edessan Rite) Churches among the Saint Thomas Syrian Christians are the Syro Malabar Church and the Chaldean Syrian Church. The West Syriac Antiochian Rite Churches among the Saint Thomas Syrian Christians are the Malankara Jacobite Syrian Church, the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, the Mar Thoma Syrian Church, the Syro Malankara Church and the Thozhiyur Church.\nEastern Catholic Churches.\nThe twenty-three Eastern Catholic Churches are in communion with the Holy See at the Vatican whilst being rooted in the theological and liturgical traditions of Eastern Christianity. Most of these churches were originally part of the Orthodox East, but have since been reconciled to the Latin Church.\nMany of these churches were originally part of one of the above families and so are closely related to them by way of ethos and liturgical practice. As in the other Eastern churches, married men may become priests, and parish priests administer the mystery of confirmation to newborn infants immediately after baptism, via the rite of chrismation; the infants are then administered Holy Communion.\nThe Syro-Malabar Church, which is part of the Saint Thomas Christian community in India, follows East Syriac traditions and liturgy. Other Saint Thomas Christians of India, who were originally of the same East Syriac tradition, passed instead to the West Syriac tradition and now form part of Oriental Orthodoxy (some from the Oriental Orthodox in India united with the Catholic Church in 1930 and became the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church). The Maronite Church claims never to have been separated from Rome, and has no counterpart Orthodox Church out of communion with the Pope. It is therefore inaccurate to refer to it as a \"Uniate\" Church. The Italo-Albanian Catholic Church has also never been out of communion with Rome, but, unlike the Maronite Church, it resembles the liturgical rite of the Eastern Orthodox Church.\nDissenting movements.\nIn addition to these four mainstream branches, there are a number of much smaller groups which originated from disputes with the dominant tradition of their original areas. Most of these are either part of the more traditional Old Believer movement, which arose from a schism within Russian Orthodoxy, or the more radical Spiritual Christianity movement. The latter includes a number of diverse \"low-church\" groups, from the Bible-centered Molokans to the anarchic Doukhobors to the self-mutilating Skoptsy. None of these groups are in communion with the mainstream churches listed above. There are also national dissidents, where ethnic groups want their own nation-church, such as the Macedonian Orthodox Church and the Montenegrin Orthodox Church; both are domiciles of the Serbian Orthodox Church. There are also some Reformed Churches which share characteristics of Eastern Christianity, to varying extents.\n\"True Orthodox\" churches.\nStarting in the 1920s, parallel hierarchies formed in opposition to local Orthodox churches over ecumenism and other matters. These jurisdictions sometimes refer to themselves as being \"True Orthodox\". In Russia, underground churches formed and maintained solidarity with the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia until the late 1970s. There are now traditionalist Orthodox in every area, though in Asia and Egypt their presence is negligible.\nEastern Protestant Churches.\nEastern Protestant Christianity comprises a collection of heterogeneous Protestant denominations which are mostly the result of Protestant Churches adopting Reformation variants of Orthodox Christian liturgy and worship. Some others are the result of reformations of Orthodox Christian beliefs and practices, inspired by the teachings of Western Protestant missionaries. Denominations of this category include the Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church ,\nUkrainian Lutheran Church, St. Thomas Evangelical Church of India, Evangelical Orthodox Church, etc.\nByzantine Rite Lutheranism.\nByzantine Rite Lutheranism arose in the Ukrainian Lutheran Church around 1926. It sprung up in the region of Galicia and its rites are based on the Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom. The church suffered persecution under the Communist r\u00e9gime, which implemented a policy of state atheism.\nCatholic\u2013Orthodox ecumenism.\nEcumenical dialogue since the 1964 meeting between Pope Paul VI and Orthodox Patriarch Athenagoras I has awoken the nearly 1,000-year hopes for Christian unity. Since the lifting of excommunications during the Paul VI and Athenagoras I meeting in Jerusalem there have been other significant meetings between Popes and Ecumenical Patriarchs of Constantinople. One of the most recent meetings was between Benedict XVI and Bartholomew I, who jointly signed the \"Common Declaration\". It states that \"We give thanks to the Author of all that is good, who allows us once again, in prayer and in dialogue, to express the joy we feel as brothers and to renew \"our commitment to move towards full communion\"\".\nIn 2013 Patriarch Bartholomew I attended the installation ceremony of the new Catholic Pope, Francis, which was the first time any Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople had ever attended such an installation.\nIn 2019, Primate of the OCU Metropolitan of Kyiv and All Ukraine Epiphanius stated that \"theoretically\" the Orthodox Church of Ukraine and the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church could in the future unite into a united church around the Kyiv throne. In 2019, the primate of the UGCC, Major Archbishop of Kyiv-Galicia Sviatoslav, stated that every effort should be made to restore the original unity of the Kyivan Church in its Orthodox and Catholic branches, saying that the restoration of Eucharistic communion between Rome and Constantinople is not a utopia.\nRejection of Uniatism.\nAt a meeting in Balamand, Lebanon, in June 1993, the Joint International Commission for the Theological Dialogue between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church declared that these initiatives that \"led to the union of certain communities with the See of Rome and brought with them, as a consequence, the breaking of communion with their Mother Churches of the East \u2026 took place not without the interference of extra-ecclesial interests\"; and that what has been called \"uniatism\" \"can no longer be accepted either as a method to be followed nor as a model of the unity our Churches are seeking\" (section 12).\nAt the same time, the Commission stated:\nMigration trends.\nThere has been a significant Christian migration in the 20th century from the Near East. Fifteen hundred years ago Christians were the majority population in today's Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine and Egypt. In 1914 Christians constituted 25% of the population of the Ottoman Empire. At the beginning of the 21st century Christians constituted 6\u20137% of the region's population: less than 1% in Turkey, 3% in Iraq, 12% in Syria, 39% in Lebanon, 6% in Jordan, 2.5% in Israel/Palestine and 15\u201320% in Egypt.\nAs of 2011 Eastern Orthodox Christians are among the wealthiest Christians in the United States. They also tend to be better educated than most other religious groups in America, having a high number of graduate (68%) and post-graduate (28%) degrees per capita.\nRole of Christians in Arabic culture.\nScholars and intellectuals agree Christians have made significant contributions to Arab and Islamic civilization since the introduction of Islam, and they have had a significant impact contributing the culture of the Middle East and North Africa and other areas. Byzantine science played an important and crucial role in the transmission of classical knowledge to the Islamic world.\nChristians, especially Nestorians, contributed to the Arab Islamic Civilization during the Umayyads and the Abbasids by translating works of Greek philosophers to Syriac and afterwards to Arabic. They also excelled in philosophy, science (such as Hunayn ibn Ishaq, Qusta ibn Luqa, Masawaiyh, Patriarch Eutychius, Jabril ibn Bukhtishu etc.) and theology (such as Tatian, Bar Daisan, Babai the Great, Nestorius, Toma bar Yacoub, etc.) and the personal physicians of the Abbasid Caliphs were often Assyrian Christians such as the long serving Bukhtishus. Many scholars of the House of Wisdom were of Christian background.\nA hospital and medical training center existed at Gundeshapur. The city of Gundeshapur was founded in AD 271 by the Sassanid king Shapur I. It was one of the major cities in Khuzestan province of the Persian empire in what is today Iran. A large percentage of the population was Syriacs, most of whom were Christians. Under the rule of Khusraw I, refuge was granted to Greek Nestorian Christian philosophers including the scholars of the Persian School of Edessa (Urfa), also called the academy of Athens, a Christian theological and medical university. These scholars made their way to Gundeshapur in 529 following the closing of the academy by Emperor Justinian. They were engaged in medical sciences and initiated the first translation projects of medical texts. The arrival of these medical practitioners from Edessa marks the beginning of the hospital and medical center at Gundeshapur. It included a medical school and hospital (bimaristan), a pharmacology laboratory, a translation house, a library and an observatory. Indian doctors also contributed to the school at Gundeshapur, most notably the medical researcher Mankah. Later after Islamic invasion, the writings of Mankah and of the Indian doctor Sustura were translated into Arabic at Baghdad. Daud al-Antaki was one of the last generation of influential Arab Christian writers.\nArab Christians and Arabic-speaking Christians, especially Maronites, played important roles in the Nahda, and because Arab Christians formed the educated upper and bourgeois classes, they have had a significant impact in politics, business and culture, and most important figures of the Nahda movement were Christian Arabs. Today Arab Christians still play important roles in the Arab world, and Christians are relatively wealthy, well educated, and politically moderate.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "42208", "revid": "50150496", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42208", "title": "Great Lent", "text": "Observance in Eastern Christianity\nGreat Lent, or the Great Fast (Greek: \u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7 \u03a4\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae, \"Megali Tessarakosti\" or \u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7 \u039d\u03b7\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1, \"Megali Nisteia\", meaning \"Great 40 Days\", and \"Great Fast\", respectively), is the most important fasting season of the church year within many denominations of Eastern Christianity. It is intended to prepare Christians for the greatest feast of the church year, Easter.\nGreat Lent shares its origins with the Lent of Western Christianity and has many similarities with it. There are some differences in the timing of Lent, besides calculating the date of Easter and how it is practiced, both liturgically in the public worship of the church and individually.\nOne difference between Eastern Christianity and Western Christianity is the calculation of the date of Easter (see Computus). Most years, the Eastern Pascha falls after the Western Easter, and it may be as much as five weeks later; occasionally, the two dates coincide. Like Western Lent, Great Lent itself lasts for forty days, but in contrast to the West, Sundays are included in the count while Holy Week is not.\nGreat Lent officially begins on Clean Monday, seven weeks before Pascha (Ash Wednesday is not observed in Eastern Christianity), and runs for 40 continuous days, concluding with the Presanctified Liturgy on Friday of the Sixth Week. The next day is called Lazarus Saturday, the day before Palm Sunday.\nFasting continues throughout the following week, known as Passion Week or Holy Week, and does not end until after the Paschal Vigil early in the morning of Pascha (Easter Sunday).\nPurpose.\nThe purpose of Great Lent is to prepare the faithful to not only commemorate, but to enter into the Passion and Resurrection of Jesus. The totality of the Byzantine Rite life centers around the Resurrection. Great Lent is intended to be a \"workshop\" where the character of the believer is spiritually uplifted and strengthened; where their life is rededicated to the principles and ideals of the Gospel; where fasting and prayer culminate in deep conviction of life; where apathy and disinterest turn into vigorous activities of faith and good works.\nLent is not for the sake of Lent itself, as fasting is not for the sake of fasting. Rather, these are means by which and for which the individual believer prepares himself to reach for, accept and attain the calling of their Savior. Therefore, the significance of Great Lent is highly appraised, not only by the monks who gradually increased the length of time of the Lent, but also by the lay people themselves. The Eastern Orthodox lenten rules are the monastic rules. These rules exist not as a Pharisaic law, \"burdens grievous to be borne\" , but as an ideal to be striven for; not as an end in themselves, but as a means to the purification of heart, the enlightening of mind, the liberation of soul and body from sin, and the spiritual perfection crowned in the virtue of love towards God and man.\nIn the Byzantine Rite, asceticism is not exclusively for the \"professional\" religious, but for each layperson as well, according to their strength. As such, Great Lent is a sacred Institute of the Church to serve the individual believer in participating as a member of the Mystical Body of Christ. It provides each person an annual opportunity for self-examination and improving the standards of faith and morals in their Christian life. The deep intent of the believer during Great Lent is encapsulated in the words of Saint Paul: \"forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus\" ().\nThrough spending more time than usual in prayer and meditation on the Holy Scripture and the Holy Traditions of the Church, the believer in Christ becomes through the grace of God more godlike. The emphasis towards this period differs somewhat from Western Christianity- the Eastern focus is less on repentance and more of an attempt to recapture humanity's original state.\nHistory.\nThe pattern of fasting and praying for 40 days is seen in the Christian Bible, on which basis the liturgical season of Lent was established. In the Old Testament, the prophet Moses went into the mountains for 40 days and 40 nights to pray and fast \"without eating bread or drinking water\" before receiving the Ten Commandments (cf. ). Likewise, the prophet Elijah went into the mountains for 40 days and nights to fast and pray \"until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God\" when \"the word of the Lord came to him\" (cf. ). The early Christian bishop Maximus of Turin wrote that as Elijah by \"fasting continuously for a period of forty days and forty nights...merited to extinguish the prolonged and severe dryness of the whole world, doing so with a stream of rain and steeping the earth's dryness with the bounty of water from heaven\", in the Christian tradition, this is interpreted as being \"a figure of ourselves so that we, also fasting a total of forty days, might merit the spiritual rain of baptism...[and] a shower from heaven might pour down upon the dry earth of the whole world, and the abundant waters of the saving bath might saturate the lengthy drought of the Gentiles.\" In the New Testament, Jesus went into the desert to fast and pray for 40 days and 40 nights; it was during this time that Satan tried to tempt him (cf. ). The 40-day and night fasts of Moses, Elijah, and Jesus prepared them for their work.\nEarly Christianity records the tradition of the Black Fast before Easter; for the meal of the day consumed after sunset (when the fast is broken), the Apostolic Constitutions permit the consumption of \"bread, vegetables, salt and water, in Lent\" with \"flesh and wine being forbidden.\" The Canons of Hippolytus authorize only bread and salt to be consumed during Holy Week. The practice of fasting and abstaining from alcohol, meat and lacticinia during Lent thus became established in the Church.\nObservance.\nSelf-discipline.\nObservance of Great Lent is characterized by fasting and abstinence from certain foods, intensified private and public prayer, self-examination, confession, personal improvement, repentance and restitution for sins committed, and almsgiving. Fasting is defined as not consuming food or liquids until evening (at sundown). In the Coptic Orthodox Church, the Black Fast is the normative way of fasting during Great Lent; these Oriental Orthodox Christians go without water and food from midnight to sunset; after that time, the consumption of water and one vegetarian meal is permitted.\nThe Lenten supper that is eaten after the fast is broken in the evening must not include certain foods. Foods most commonly abstained from are meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, wine, and oil. According to some traditions, only olive oil is abstained from; in others, all vegetable oils. While wine and oil are permitted on Saturdays, Sundays, and a few feast days, and fish is permitted on Palm Sunday as well as the Annunciation when it falls before Palm Sunday, and caviar is permitted on Lazarus Saturday, meat and dairy are prohibited entirely until the fast is broken on Easter (Pascha) Sunday. Additionally, married Eastern Orthodox Christians and Oriental Orthodox Christians traditionally abstain from sexual relations during Lent \"to give themselves time for fasting and prayer (1 Cor. 7: 5).\".\nBesides the additional liturgical celebrations described below, Christians are expected to pay closer attention to and increase their private prayer. According to Byzantine Rite theology, when asceticism is increased, prayer must be increased also. The Church Fathers have referred to fasting without prayer as \"the fast of the demons\" since the demons do not eat according to their incorporeal nature, but neither do they pray.\nLiturgical observances.\nGreat Lent is unique in that, liturgically, the weeks do not run from Sunday to Saturday, but rather begin on Monday and end on Sunday, and most weeks are named for the lesson from the Gospel which will be read at the Divine Liturgy on its concluding Sunday. This is to illustrate that the entire season is anticipatory, leading up to the greatest Sunday of all: Pascha.\nDuring the Great Fast, a special service book is used, known as the Lenten Triodion, which contains the Lenten texts for the Daily Office (Canonical Hours) and Liturgies. The Triodion begins during the Pre-Lenten period to supplement or replace portions of the regular services. This replacement begins gradually, initially affecting only the Epistle and Gospel readings, and gradually increases until Holy Week when it entirely replaces all other liturgical material. During the Triduum even the Psalter is eliminated, and all texts are taken exclusively from the Triodion. The Triodion is used until the lights are extinguished before midnight at the Paschal Vigil, at which time it is replaced by the Pentecostarion, which begins by replacing the normal services entirely (during Bright Week) and gradually diminishes until the normal services resume following the Afterfeast of Pentecost.\nOn the weekdays of Great Lent, the full Divine Liturgy is not celebrated, because the joy of the Eucharist (literally \"Thanksgiving\") is contrary to the attitude of repentance which predominates on these days. Since it is considered especially important to receive the Holy Mysteries (Holy Communion) during this season, the Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts\u2014also called the Liturgy of St. Gregory the Dialogist\u2014 may be celebrated on weekdays.\nThis service starts with Vespers during which a portion of the Body and Blood of Christ, which was reserved the previous Sunday, is brought to the prothesis table. This is followed by a solemn great entrance where the Holy Mysteries are brought to the altar table, and then, skipping the anaphora (eucharistic prayer), the outline of remainder of the divine liturgy is followed, including holy communion. Most parishes and monasteries celebrate this liturgy only on Wednesdays, Fridays and feast days, but it may be celebrated on any weekday of Great Lent.\nBecause the divine liturgy is not celebrated on weekdays, the Typica occupies its place in the canonical hours, whether or not a liturgy is celebrated at vespers. On Saturday and Sunday the Divine Liturgy may be celebrated as usual. On Saturdays, the usual Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom is celebrated; on Sundays the longer Divine Liturgy of St. Basil the Great is used.\nThe services of the Canonical Hours are much longer during Great Lent and the structure of the services is different on weekdays. The usual evening small compline is replaced by the much longer service of Great Compline. While in the Russian tradition Great Compline is used on Friday night (though some parts are read rather than sung and some Lenten material is replaced by non-Lenten hymns), in the Greek practice, ordinary Compline is used together with, on the first four weeks, a quarter of the Akathist to the Theotokos. On the fifth Saturday, known as the Saturday of the Akathist, everywhere, the entire Akathist is sung at Matins.\nIn \u201cThe Typikon Decoded\u201d, Archbishop Job Getcha offers this comparison of the commemorations associated with the Sundays of Great Lent in the \u201cAncient Triodion\u201d. These more ancient commemorations are retained in the hymnography still in use for the \u201cContemporary\u201d Sundays of St Gregory Palamas, St John of the Ladder, and St Mary of Egypt. \u00a0On each of these, the troparia of the 1st Canon at Matins reference the more ancient commemoration, the Prodigal Son, Good Samaritan, and the Rich Man and Lazarus respectively. \u00a0\nDuring Palm Week, between the Sunday of St Mary of Egypt and Lazarus Saturday, the 1st Canon at Matins on each weekday references the parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus as a parallel to the Lazarus of Bethany who falls ill and is raised from the dead after four days in the tomb (John 11:1\u201345).\nTheme of Lenten joy.\nA difference between the Eastern and Western observances is that while in the West the chanting of Alleluia ceases during Lent, in the East its use is increased. This is because for Christians, fasting should be joyous (cf. ), and the sense of unworthiness must always be tempered with hope in God's forgiveness.\nIn fact, days which follow the Lenten pattern of services are referred to as \"days with Alleluia\". This theme of \"Lenten joy\" is also found in many of the hymns of the Triodion, such as the stichera which begin with the words: \"The Lenten Spring has dawned!...\" (Vespers Aposticha, Wednesday of \"Maslenitsa\") and \"Now is the season of repentance; let us begin it joyfully, O brethren...\" (Matins, Second Canon, Ode 8, Monday of \"Maslenitsa\").\nThe making of prostrations during the services increases as well. The one prayer that typifies the Lenten services is the Prayer of Saint Ephrem, which is said at each service on weekdays, accompanied by full prostrations. One translation of it reads:\n&lt;poem&gt;\nO Lord and master of my life! a spirit of idleness, despondency, ambition and idle-talking, give me not. \nBut rather, a spirit of chastity, humble-mindedness, patience and charity, bestow upon me Thy servant. \nYea, my king and Lord, grant me to see my own failings and refrain from judging others: For blessed art Thou unto ages of ages. Amen. \n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe public reading of Scripture is increased during Great Lent. The Psalter (Book of Psalms), which is normally read through once a week, is read through twice each week for the six weeks prior to Holy Week. Readings from the Old Testament are also increased, with the Books of Genesis, Proverbs and Isaiah being read through almost in their entirety at the Sixth Hour and Vespers. During Cheesefare Week, the readings at these services are taken from Joel and Zechariah, while during Holy Week they are from Exodus, Ezekiel and Job.\nUniquely, on weekdays of Great Lent there is no public reading of the Epistles or Gospels. This is because the readings are particular to the divine liturgy, which is not celebrated on weekdays of Great Lent. There are, however, Epistles and Gospels appointed for each Saturday and Sunday.\nPrayer for the dead.\nDuring the Great Fast, the church also increases its prayer for the dead, not only reminding the believer of his own mortality, and thus increasing the spirit of penitence, but also to remind him of his Christian obligation of charity in praying for the departed. A number of Saturdays during Great Lent are Saturdays of the Dead, with many of the hymns of the Daily Office and at the Divine Liturgy dedicated to remembrance of the departed. These Saturdays are:\nIn addition, the Lity, a brief prayer service for the departed, may be served on each weekday of Great Lent, provided there is no feast day or special observance on that day.\nFeast days.\nSince the season of Great Lent is moveable, beginning on different dates from year to year, accommodation must be made for various feast days on the fixed calendar (Menaion) which occur during the season. When these feasts fall on a weekday of Great Lent, the normal Lenten aspect of the services is lessened to celebrate the solemnity.\nThe most important of these fixed feasts is the Great Feast of the Annunciation (March 25), which is considered to be so important that it is never moved, even if it should fall on the Sunday of Pascha itself, a rare and special occurrence which is known as \"Kyrio-Pascha\". The fast is also lessened, and the faithful are allowed to eat fish, unless it is Good Friday or Holy Saturday. Whereas on other weekdays of Great Lent, no celebration of the Divine Liturgy is permitted, there is a Liturgy (usually the Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom) celebrated on Annunciation\u2014even if it falls on Good Friday.\nWhen the feast day of the patron saint of the parish church or monastery falls on a weekday of Great Lent, there is no liturgy (other than the Presanctified), but fish is allowed at the meal. In some churches the feast of a patron saint is moved to the nearest Saturday (excluding the Saturday of the Akathist), and in other churches, it is celebrated on the day of the feast itself.\nWhen some other important feast occurs on a weekday, such as the First and Second Finding of the Head of John the Baptist (February 24), the Forty Martyrs of Sebaste (March 9), etc., it is usually combined with the Lenten service, and wine and oil are allowed at the meal.\nRegardless of the rank of the feast being celebrated, the Lenten hymns contained in the Triodion are never omitted, but are always chanted in their entirety, even on the feast of the Annunciation.\nOn the Saturdays, Sundays, and a number of weekdays during Great Lent, the service materials from the Triodion leave no room for the commemoration of the Saint of the day from the Menaion. In order that their services not be completely forgotten, a portion of them (their canon at Matins, and their stichera from \"Lord I Have Cried\" at Vespers) is chanted at Compline.\nReadings.\nIn addition to the added readings from Scripture, spiritual books by the Church Fathers are recommended during the Fast.\nOne book commonly read during Great Lent, particularly by monastics, is \"The Ladder of Divine Ascent\", which was written in about the 7th century by St. John of the Ladder when he was the Hegumen (Abbot) of Saint Catherine's Monastery on Mount Sinai. \"The Ladder\" is usually read in the trapeza (refectory) during meals, but it may alternatively be read during the Little Hours on weekdays so that everyone can hear. Many of the laity also read \"The Ladder\" privately during Great Lent.\nThe theme of \"The Ladder\" is not Great Lent itself, but rather it deals with the ascent of the soul from earth to heaven. That is, from enslavement to the passions to the building up of the virtues and its eventual theosis (union with God), which is the goal of Great Lent.\nBesides the \"Ladder\", in some monasteries the \"Paradise of the Holy Fathers\" by Palladius and the penitential sermons of St. Ephrem the Syrian are read during Matins.\nOutline.\nLiturgically, the period of the Triodion can be divided into three sections: (1) the Pre-Lenten period, (2) the Great Forty Days, and (3) Holy Week.\nPre-Lenten period.\nBefore the forty days of Great Lent commence, there is a three-week Pre-Lenten season, to prepare the faithful for the spiritual work they are to accomplish during the Great Fast. During this period many of the themes which will be developed in the liturgical texts of the forty days are introduced. Each week runs from Monday to Sunday and is named for the Gospel theme of the Sunday which concludes it.\nIn the Slavic tradition, with the addition of Zacchaeus Sunday, some regard the pre-Lenten period as lasting four weeks, but there are no liturgical indications that the week following the fifth Sunday before Lent (whether preceded by Zacchaeus Sunday or otherwise) is in any way Lenten, because Zacchaeus Sunday falls outside the \"Triodion\", the liturgical book which governs the pre-Lenten period and Lent itself.\nZacchaeus Sunday.\nIn the Slavic liturgical traditions, Zacchaeus Sunday occurs on the fifth Sunday before the beginning of Great Lent (which starts on a Monday). Though there are no materials provided in the Lenten Triodion for this day, it is the very first day that is affected by the date of the upcoming Pascha (all the preceding days having been affected by the previous Pascha). This day has one sole Pre-Lenten feature: the Gospel reading is always the account of Zacchaeus from , for which reason this Sunday is referred to as \"Zacchaeus Sunday\" (though the week before is not called \"Zacchaeus week\").\nThis reading actually falls at the end of the lectionary cycle, being assigned to the 32nd Week after Pentecost. However, depending upon the date of the upcoming Pascha, the readings of the preceding weeks are either skipped (if Pascha will be early) or repeated (if it will be late) so that the readings for the 32nd Sunday after Pentecost always occur on the Sunday preceding the Week of the Publican and the Pharisee.\nIn the Byzantine (\"Greek\") liturgical traditions, the Gospel reading for Zacchaeus remains in the normal lectionary cycle and does not always fall on the fifth Sunday before Lent. In fact, it usually falls a few weeks before, and the fifth Sunday before Lent is known as the Sunday of the Canaanite Woman after the story in .\nThe Lenten significance of the Gospel account of Zacchaeus is that it introduces the themes of pious zeal (Zacchaeus' climbing up the sycamore tree; Jesus' words: \"Zacchaeus, make haste\"), restraint (Jesus' words: \"come down\"), making a place for Jesus in the heart (\"I must abide at thy house\"), overcoming gossip (\"And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner\"), repentance and almsgiving (\"And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord: Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold\"), forgiveness and reconciliation (\"And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham\"), and the reason for the Passion and Resurrection (\"For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost\").\nThe Epistle reading for Zacchaeus Sunday is , which in and of itself has no Lenten theme, other than as an admonition to righteous behaviour.\nPublican and Pharisee.\nThe reading on the Sunday which concludes this week is the Parable of the Publican and the Pharisee (). The Sunday of the Publican and the Pharisee is the first day the Lenten Triodion is used (at Vespers or All-Night Vigil on Saturday night), though it is only used for the Sunday services, with nothing pertaining to weekdays or Saturday. The theme of the hymns and readings on this Sunday is dedicated to the lessons to be learned from the parable: that righteous actions alone do not lead to salvation, that pride renders good deeds fruitless, that God can only be approached through a spirit of humility and repentance, and that God justifies the humble rather than the self-righteous. The week which follows the Sunday of the Publican and the Pharisee is a fast-free week, to remind the faithful not to be prideful in their fasting as the Pharisee was ().\nThe Sunday of the Publican and the Pharisee is also the first day that \"structural\" changes (as opposed to simply substituting Lenten hymns for normal hymns from the octoechos or menaion) are made to the Sunday services. For example, there begins to be a significant 'split' after the Great Prokimenon at Vespers that night. \nProdigal Son.\nThe theme of this week is the Parable of the Prodigal Son (). Again, the Triodion does not give propers for the weekdays. The Gospel Reading on Sunday lays out one of the most important themes of the Lenten season: the process of falling into sin, realization of one's sinfulness, the road to repentance, and finally reconciliation, each of which is illustrated in the course of the parable.\nThe week following is the only week of the Triodion on which there is normal fasting (i.e. no meat, fish, wine, oil or animal products on Wednesday or Friday except if an important feast such as the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple or Forty Martyrs of Sebaste falls on that day, in which case certain foods are allowed).\nMeatfare Week.\nThe Saturday of this week is the first Saturday of the Dead observed during the Great Lenten season. The proper name in the typikon for the Sunday of this week is \"The Sunday of the Last Judgment\", indicating the theme of the Gospel of the day (). The popular name of \"Meatfare Sunday\" comes from the fact that this is the last day on which the laity are permitted to eat meat until Pascha (Byzantine Rite monks and nuns never eat meat).\nCheesefare Week.\nDuring Cheesefare Week the eating of dairy products is permitted on every day (even Wednesday and Friday, which are normally observed as fast days throughout the year), though meat may no longer be eaten any day of the week. On the weekdays of this week, the first Lenten structural elements are introduced to the cycle of services on weekdays (the chanting of \"Alleluia\", the Prayer of Saint Ephrem, making prostrations, etc.).\nWednesday and Friday are the most lenten, but some lenten elements are also observed on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. The office of Cheesefare Saturday celebrates the \"Holy Ascetic Fathers\".\nCheesefare Week is concluded on Cheesefare Sunday. The proper name for this Sunday is \"The Sunday of Forgiveness\", both because of the Gospel theme for the day () and because it is the day on which everyone asks forgiveness of their neighbor. The popular name of \"Cheesefare Sunday\" derives from the fact that it is the last day to eat dairy products before Pascha. On this Sunday, Eastern Christians identify with Adam and Eve, and forgive each other in order to obtain forgiveness from God, typically in a Forgiveness Vespers service that Sunday evening.\nDuring Forgiveness Vespers (on Sunday evening) the hangings and vestments in the church are changed to somber Lenten colours to reflect a penitential mood. At the end of the service comes the \"Ceremony of Mutual Forgiveness\" during which all of the people one by one ask forgiveness of one another, that the Great Fast may begin in a spirit of peace.\nThe Great Forty Days.\nThe forty days of Great Lent last from Clean Monday until the Friday of the Sixth Week. Each of the Sundays of Great Lent has its own special commemoration, though these are not necessarily repeated during the following week. However, during the Third, Fifth and Sixth Weeks, the idiomelon at Vespers is based on the same parable that the Canon at Matins the previous Sunday was (the Prodigal Son, the Good Samaritan and Lazarus and the Rich Man respectively). An exception is the Week of the Cross (the Fourth Week), during which the theme of the preceding Sunday\u2014the Veneration of the Cross\u2014is repeated throughout the week. The themes introduced in the Pre-Lenten period continue to be developed throughout the forty days.\nClean Week.\nThe first week of Great Lent starting on Clean Monday, the first day of Great Lent. The name \"Clean Week\" refers to the spiritual cleansing each of the faithful is encouraged to undergo through fasting, prayer, repentance, reception of the Holy Mysteries and begging forgiveness of his neighbor. It is also traditionally a time for spring cleaning so that one's outward surroundings matches his inward disposition.\nThroughout this week fasting is most strict. Those who have the strength are encouraged to fast completely, eating only on Wednesday and Friday evenings, after the Presanctified Liturgy. Those who are unable to keep such a strict fast are encouraged to eat only a little, and then only xerophagy (see Prodigal Son) once a day. On Monday, no food should be eaten at all and only uncooked food on Tuesday and Thursday. Meals are served on Saturday and Sunday, but these are fasting meals at which meat, dairy products and fish are forbidden.\nAt Great Compline during the first four days of the Fast (Monday through Thursday) the Great Canon of St. Andrew of Crete is divided into four parts and one part is chanted each night.\nThe First Saturday is called \"St. Theodore Saturday\" in honor of St. Theodore the Recruit, a 4th-century martyr. At the end of the Presanctified Liturgy on Friday (since, liturgically, the day begins at sunset) a special canon to St. Theodore, composed by St. John of Damascus, is chanted. Then the priest blesses kolyva (boiled wheat with honey and raisins) which is distributed to the faithful in commemoration of the following miracle worked by St. Theodore on the First Saturday of Great Lent.\nFifty years after the death of St Theodore, the emperor Julian the Apostate (361-363), as a part of his general policy of persecution of Christians, commanded the governor of Constantinople during the first week of Great Lent to sprinkle all the food provisions in the marketplaces with the blood offered to pagan idols, knowing that the people would be hungry after the strict fasting of the first week. St Theodore appeared in a dream to Archbishop Eudoxius, ordering him to inform all the Christians that no one should buy anything at the marketplaces, but rather to eat cooked wheat with honey (kolyva).\nThe First Sunday of Great Lent is the Feast of Orthodoxy, which commemorates the restoration of the veneration of icons after the Iconoclast controversy, which is considered to be the triumph of the Church over the last of the great heresies which troubled her (all later heresies being simply a rehashing of earlier ones). Before the Divine Liturgy on this day, a special service, known as the \"Triumph of Orthodoxy\" is held in cathedrals and major monasteries, at which the \"synodicon\" (containing anathemas against various heresies, and encomia of those who have held fast to the Christian faith) is proclaimed.\nThe theme of the day is the victory of the True Faith over heresy. \"This is the victory that overcomes the world, our faith\" (). Also, the icons of the saints bear witness that man, \"created in the image and likeness of God\" (), may become holy and godlike through the purification of himself as God's living image.\nThe First Sunday of Great Lent originally commemorated the Prophets such as Moses, Aaron, and Samuel. The Liturgy's Prokeimenon and alleluia verses as well as the Epistle (Hebrews 11:24-26,32-40) and Gospel () readings appointed for the day continue to reflect this older usage.\nSecond Week.\nThe Second Sunday of Great Lent commemorates St. Gregory Palamas, the great defender of the Church's doctrine of Hesychasm against its attack by Barlaam of Calabria. The Epistle is Hebrews 1:10-14; 2:1-3 and the Gospel is \nThroughout this week, and until the Sixth Friday in Lent, one meal may be taken a day with xerophagy. Until the Sixth Saturday in Lent, Saturday and Sunday fasting remains the same as in the First Week.\nThird Week.\nThe Veneration of the Cross is celebrated on the third Sunday. The veneration comes on this day because it is the midpoint of the forty days. The services for this day are similar to those on the Great Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross (September 14). During the All-Night Vigil the priest brings the cross out into the center of the church, where it is venerated by the clergy and faithful. It remains in the center of the church through Friday of the week following (the Fourth Week of Great Lent).\nThe Epistle is and the Gospel is .\nFourth Week.\nThis week is celebrated as a sort of afterfeast of the Veneration of the Cross, during which some of the hymns from the previous Sunday are repeated each day. On Monday and Wednesday of the Fourth Week, a Veneration of the Cross takes place at the First Hour (repeating a portion of the service from the All-Night Vigil of the previous Sunday). On Friday of that week, the veneration takes place after the Ninth Hour, after which the cross is solemnly returned to the sanctuary by the priest and deacon.\nThe Sunday which ends the fourth week is dedicated to St. John Climacus, whose work, \"The Ladder of Divine Ascent\" has been read throughout the Great Lenten Fast.\nFifth Week.\nOn Thursday of the Fifth Week, the Great Canon of St. Andrew of Crete is chanted in its entirety during Orthros. This is the longest Canon of the church year, and during the course of its nine Odes, most every person mentioned in the Bible is called to mind and tied to the theme of repentance. In anticipation of the Canon, Vespers on Wednesday afternoon is longer than normal, with special stichera added in honor of the Great Canon. While the Great Canon itself is recited during Matins for Thursday, this service is usually celebrated by anticipation on the prior Wednesday evening, so that more people can attend.\nAs a part of the Matins of the Great Canon, the \"Life of St. Mary of Egypt\" by St. Sophronius, Patriarch of Jerusalem (634 - 638) is read, for her example of repentance and overcoming temptation. On this day also is chanted the famous kontakion, \"My soul, my soul, why sleepest thou...\" by St. Romanos the Melodist. The next day (Thursday morning) a special Presanctified Liturgy is celebrated, and the fast is relaxed slightly (wine and oil are allowed) as consolation after the long service the night before.\nSaturday of the Fifth Week is dedicated to the Theotokos (Mother of God), and is known as the \"Saturday of the Akathist\" because the Akathist to the Theotokos is prescribed to be chanted during Matins on that day, though as with the Great Canon, usually done in anticipation on Friday evening to allow more people to attend. \nThe Fifth Sunday is dedicated to St. Mary of Egypt, whose \"Life\" was read earlier in the week during the Great Canon. At the end of the Divine Liturgy many churches celebrate a \"Blessing of Dried Fruit\", in commemoration of St. Mary's profound asceticism.\nSixth Week.\nDuring the Sixth Week the Lenten services are served as they were during the second and third weeks. However, the hymns of each day begin to take on a more narrative form (as they will during Holy Week) in anticipation of the celebration of Lazarus Saturday.\nGreat Lent ends at Vespers on the evening of the Sixth Friday, and the Lenten cycle of Old Testament readings is brought to an end. (Genesis ends with the account of the burial of Joseph, who is a type of Christ.) At that same service, the celebration of Lazarus Saturday begins. The resurrection of Lazarus is understood as a foreshadowing of the Resurrection of Jesus, and many of the Resurrection hymns normally chanted on Sunday (and which will be replaced the next day with hymns for Palm Sunday) are chanted at Matins on the morning of Lazarus Saturday.\nPalm Sunday differs from the previous Sundays in that it is one of the Great Feasts of the Orthodox Church. None of the normal Lenten material is chanted on Palm Sunday, and fish, wine and oil are permitted in the trapeza. The blessing of palms (or pussywillow) takes place at Matins on Sunday morning, and everyone stands holding palms and lit candles during the important moments of the service.\nThis is especially significant at the Great Entrance during the Divine Liturgy on Palm Sunday morning, since liturgically that entrance recreates the entry of Jesus into Jerusalem. The themes of Lazarus Saturday and Palm Sunday are tied together, and some of the same hymns (including one of the apolytikia) are chanted on both days. The Holy Week services begin on the night of Palm Sunday, and the liturgical colours are changed from the festive hues of Lazarus Saturday and Palm Sunday back to somber Lenten colours.\nHoly Week.\nAlthough technically, Holy Week is separate from Great Lent, its services mirror those of Great Lent and are contained in the same book, the \"Lenten Triodion\". Whereas, during Great Lent each week has its own theme, during Holy Week each day has its own theme, again based upon the Gospel readings for the day:\nNote that for the previous three days, one meal a day is taken a day with xerophagy.\nOne meal may be eaten on this day with wine and oil.\nNo food is to be eaten on this day.\nOne meal may be eaten with xerophagy.\nDuring Holy Week, the order of services is often brought forward by several hours: Matins being celebrated by anticipation the evening before, and Vespers in the morning. This \"reversal\" is not something mandated by the typicon but has developed out of practical necessity. Since some of the most important readings and liturgical actions take place at Matins, it is celebrated in the evening (rather than early in the morning before dawn, as is usual for Matins) so that more people can attend.\nSince during Holy Week Vespers is usually joined to either the Presanctified Liturgy or the Divine Liturgy, and since the faithful must observe a total fast from all food and drink before receiving Holy Communion, it is celebrated in the morning. Vespers on Good Friday is an exception to this, usually being celebrated in late morning or in the afternoon.\nThe Matins services for Holy Monday through Thursday are referred to as \"Bridegroom Prayer\" because the troparion of the day and the exapostilarion (the hymn that concludes the Canon) develop the theme of \"Christ the Bridegroom\". Thursday has its own troparion, but uses the same exapostilarion. The icon often displayed on these days depicts Jesus and is referred to as \"the Bridegroom\" because the crown of thorns and the robe of mockery are parallel to the crown and robe worn by a bridegroom on his wedding day.\nThis icon is often confused with the visually similar icon of Christ as the Man of Sorrows, which shows Him post-Crucifixion in the same pose but lacking the rod and robe, dead, showing the marks of the nails in his Hands and the spear wound in His side. Incidentally, Thursday has its own icon showing either the Mystical Supper or the Washing of Feet, or both. The Passion of Christ is seen as the wedding of the Saviour with his bride, the Church.\nHoly Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.\nThe first three days of Holy Week (Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday), the services all follow the same pattern and are nearly identical to the order followed on weekdays during the Great Forty Days; however, the number of Kathismata (sections from the Psalter) is reduced and the Old Testament readings are taken from different books. The Presanctified Liturgy is celebrated on each of the first three days, and there is a Gospel reading at each one (during the Forty Days there was no Gospel reading unless it was a feast day). There is also a Gospel reading at Matins on each day and the Canon chanted at Matins is much shorter, consisting of only three or four odes rather than the usual nine.\nIn addition to the Gospel readings at Matins and Vespers, there is a reading of all four Gospels which takes place during the Little Hours (Third Hour, Sixth Hour and Ninth Hour) on these first three days. Each Gospel is read in its entirety and in order, beginning with , and continuing through (the rest of the Gospel of John will be read during the remainder of Holy Week). The Gospels are divided up into nine sections with one section being read by the priest at each of the Little Hours.\nThe Prayer of Saint Ephrem is said for the last time at the end of the Presanctified Liturgy on Holy and Great Wednesday. From this moment on, there will be no more prostrations made in the church (aside from those made before the epitaphios) until Vespers on the afternoon of Pentecost.\nIn some churches, the Holy Mystery (Sacrament) of Unction is celebrated on Holy and Great Wednesday, in commemoration of the anointing of Jesus' feet in preparation for his burial ().\nThe remaining three days of Holy Week retain a smaller degree of Lenten character, but each has elements that are unique to it.\nHoly (Maundy) Thursday.\nHoly and Great Thursday is a more festive day than the others of Holy Week in that it celebrates the institution of the Eucharist. The hangings in the church and the vestments of the clergy are changed from dark Lenten hues to more festive colours (red, in the Russian tradition).\nWhereas the Divine Liturgy is forbidden on other Lenten weekdays, the Divine Liturgy of St. Basil (combined with Vespers) is celebrated on this day. Many of the standard hymns of the Liturgy are replaced with the Troparion of Great Thursday. In some churches, the Holy Table (altar) is covered with a simple white linen cloth, in commemoration of the Mystical Supper (Last Supper).\nDuring this Divine Liturgy, the reserved Mysteries are renewed (a new Lamb being consecrated, and the old Body and Blood of Christ being consumed by the deacon after the Liturgy). Also, when the supply of Chrism runs low, it is at this Liturgy that the heads of the autocephalous churches will Sanctify new Chrism, After the Little Entrance the Gospel reading is a concatenation of the four Evangelists' accounts of the Crucifixion and the Descent from the Cross. At the point during the reading which mentions Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, two clergymen approach the large cross in the center of the church, remove the \"soma\", wrap it in a piece of white linen, and carry it into the sanctuary.\nLater, during the Troparion, the clergy carry the epitaphios (a cloth icon symbolizing the winding sheet in which Jesus was prepared for burial) into the center of the church, where it is venerated by all the faithful. Special chants and prayers and chanted along with biblical readings and psalms chanted.\nThat night, the Matins of Lamentation is normally celebrated in the evening. At this service, special hymns and prayers are chanted. The Lamentations of Great and Holy Friday are the main chants of the service. The Lamentation Praises are chanted to very movingly beautiful ancient tones and words which reflect the lament of the Theotokos over her son Christ. The epitaphios is placed on a beautifully ornate and decorate catafalque or bier before the Lamentations representing the tomb of Christ.\nThe priest then sprinkles rosewater and fresh rose petals all over the tomb, the congregation, and the temple/church. A procession with the ornate tomb then takes place around the church and back into the church where it will be venerated by everyone. As more special prayers and chants are sung especially the chant: \"The Noble Joseph...\" as the service finishes.\nHoly Saturday.\nHoly and Great Saturday (known also as the Great Sabbath, because on it Jesus \"rested\" from his labours on the Cross) combines elements of deep sorrow and exultant joy. This, like Good Friday is also a day of strict fasting, though a meal may be served after the Divine Liturgy at which wine (but not oil) may be used.\nThe Matins of Lamentation (usually celebrated on Friday evening) resembles the Byzantine Rite funeral service, in that its main component is the chanting of Psalm 118 (the longest Psalm in the Bible), each verse of which is interspersed with laudations (\"ainoi\") of the dead Christ. The service takes place with the clergy and people gathered around the epitaphios in the center of the church. Everyone stands holding lighted candles during the psalm. Next are chanted the \"Evlogitaria of the Resurrection\", hymns which are normally chanted only on Sundays.\nThis is the first liturgical mention of the impending Resurrection of Jesus. At the end of the Great Doxology the epitaphios is carried in procession around the outside of the church, as is the body at a priest's funeral, and then is brought back in. By local custom, the clergy may raise the epitaphios at the door so that all may pass under it as they enter in, symbolically entering into the death and resurrection of Jesus. The Gospel () is not read at its usual place during Matins, but rather, following readings of the vision in Ezekiel of the dry bones returning to life and an Epistle, near the end of the service, in front of the epitaphios. This positioning is a remnant of a pre-Byzantine rite celebrated at Jerusalem.\nThe next morning (Saturday), the Divine Liturgy of St. Basil is celebrated (combined with Vespers). At the beginning of the service, the hangings and vestments are still black. The service is much longer than usual, and includes 15 Old Testament readings recounting the history of salvation, including two canticles, the Song of Moses and the Song of the Three Holy Children, and showing types of the death and resurrection of Jesus.\nMany parts of the liturgy which are normally performed in front of the Holy Doors are instead done in front of the epitaphios. Just before the Gospel reading, the hangings and vestments are changed to white, and the entire atmosphere of the service is transformed from sorrow to joy. In the Greek practice, the priest strews the entire church with fresh bay leaves, symbolizing Christ's victory over death. This service symbolizes the descent of Christ into Hades and the Harrowing of Hell.\nThus, according to Byzantine Rite theology, Jesus' salvific work on the Cross has been accomplished, and the righteous departed in the Bosom of Abraham have been released from their bondage; however, the Good News of the Resurrection has not yet been proclaimed to the living on earth, the celebration of which commences at midnight with Matins. For this reason, neither is the fast broken nor the Paschal greeting exchanged.\nAt the end of the Divine Liturgy, the priest blesses wine and bread which are distributed to the faithful. This is different from the Sacred Mysteries (Holy Communion) which were received earlier in the service. This bread and wine are simply blessed, not consecrated. They are a remnant of the ancient tradition of the church (still observed in some places) whereby the faithful did not leave the church after the service, but were each given a glass of wine, and some bread and dried fruit to give them strength for the vigil ahead. They would listen to the reading of the Acts of the Apostles, read in full, and await the beginning of the Paschal Vigil. However, this is not usually done nowadays.\nThe last liturgical service in the Lenten Triodion is the Midnight Office which forms the first part of the Paschal Vigil. During this service the Canon of Great Saturday is repeated, near the end of which, during the ninth ode, the priest and deacon take the epitaphios into the sanctuary through the Holy Doors and lay it on the Holy Table (altar), where it remains until the feast of the Ascension. After the concluding prayers and a dismissal, all of the lights and candles in the church are extinguished, and all wait in silence and darkness for the stroke of midnight, following which the Pentecostarion replaces the Lenten Triodion, commencing with the resurrection of Christ being proclaimed.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The illegal trade of small arms, unlike other organized crime commodities, is more closely associated with exercising power in communities instead of achieving economic gain. Scholars estimate illegal arms transactions amount to over US$1 billion annually.\nTo keep track of imports and exports of several of the most dangerous armament categories, the United Nations, in 1991, created a Register for Conventional Arms. Participation, however, is not compulsory, and lacks comprehensive data in regions outside of Europe. Africa, due to a prevalence of corrupt officials and loosely enforced trade regulations, is a region with extensive illicit arms activity. In a resolution to complement the Register with legally binding obligations, a Firearms Protocol was incorporated into the UN Convention on Transnational Organized Crime, which requires states to improve systems that control trafficked ammunition and firearms.\nThe 1999 Report of the UN Panel of Governmental Experts on Small Arms provides a more refined and precise definition, which has become internationally accepted. This distinguishes between small arms (revolvers and self-loading pistols, rifles and carbines, submachine guns, assault rifles, and light machine guns), which are weapons designed for personal use, and light weapons (heavy machine guns, hand-held under-barrel and mounted grenade launchers, portable anti-aircraft guns, portable anti-tank guns, recoilless rifles, portable launchers of anti-aircraft missile systems, and mortars of calibres less than 100\u00a0mm), which are designed for use by several persons serving as a unit. Ammunition and explosives also form an integral part of small arms and light weapons used in conflict.\nImpact.\nAreas.\nAlthough arms trafficking is widespread in regions of political turmoil, it is not limited to such areas, and for example, in South Asia, an estimated 63 million guns have been trafficked into India and Pakistan.\nThe suppression of gunrunning is one of the areas of interest in the context of international law. In the United Nations, there has been widespread support to implement international legislation to prevent arms trafficking, however, it has been difficult to implement, due to many different factors that allow for arms trafficking to occur.\nAsia.\nArms trafficking in Asia is a multifaceted issue, deeply intertwined with regional conflicts, organized crime, and governance challenges. In Southeast Asia, porous borders and post-conflict zones facilitate the smuggling of firearms, often linked to non-state actors, including separatists, criminal syndicates, and terrorist groups. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has recognized the gravity of this problem and has initiated cooperative measures, such as the ASEAN Plan of Action in Combating Transnational Crime, to enhance information exchange and law enforcement capacity building.\nIn South Asia, countries like India face significant challenges due to the influx of illegal small arms, which exacerbate internal security issues and insurgencies. The United Nations has facilitated regional workshops to address gun violence and illicit small arms trafficking, emphasizing the need for a gender perspective in policy formulation.\nWestern Asia, particularly the Middle East, has become a hotspot for arms trafficking, with weapons often recycled from past conflicts. This proliferation fuels ongoing instability and empowers organized crime groups, leading to a cycle of violence and insecurity. Efforts to combat arms trafficking in Asia are further complicated by the involvement of transnational organized crime groups, which operate across borders and engage in various illicit activities, including arms smuggling. International initiatives, like the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime and its protocols, aim to provide a framework for cooperation and legal measures to address these challenges.\nIsrael and Palestine.\nPrior to the founding of Israel, law enforcement of the British Mandate of Palestine uncovered a cache of weapons in 359 drums of cement during the 1935 Cement Incident. Although no arrests were made, the listed recipient was a Jewish merchant named J. Katan. The incident led to a series of protests from Arab communities, and violent reprisals by armed groups loyal to Sheikh Izz ad-Din al-Qassam.\nShortly after the State of Israel was declared on May 14, 1948, the Arab-Israeli war broke out. During the war, the United States and later the United Nations imposed an arms embargo targeting all sides. Both Israel and the Arab League bought weapons from the black market to supply their forces. Notably, Czechoslovakia supplied Israel during Operation Balak and Operation Velvetta. Czechoslovakia also attempted to supply weapons to Syria on behalf of the Arab Liberation Army.\nThroughout the Cold War, Israel still smuggled military equipment on a small scale. One example was the acquisition of five Sa'ar 3-class missile boat in the Cherbourg Project. These vessels were purchased from France, but were not delivered due to an arms embargo. Meanwhile, the Palestine Liberation Organization and other Palestinian armed groups secretly received weapons from the Warsaw Pact before official relations began.\nPost-Cold War, groups such as Hamas smuggle weaponry via underground tunnels and boats. Other weapons are acquired through purchasing from corrupt Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers or theft from Israeli settlements in the West Bank.\nAhmed Jibril, the leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command claimed responsibility for attempting to smuggle weapons into the Gaza Strip using the Santorini fishing boat. The IDF claimed to disrupt other smuggling runs in the Karine A affair, Francop Affair, the Klos C cargo ship seizure, and the Victoria Affair.\nIran.\nIran's arms trafficking operations are primarily orchestrated by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' (IRGC) Quds Force, notably through its specialized units, Unit 190 and Unit 700. These units are responsible for clandestine weapons transfers to Iranian-aligned groups across the Middle East, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza, the Houthis in Yemen, and various militias in Syria and Iraq.\nUnit 190 specializes in smuggling weapons by land, sea, and air, employing covert methods such as disguising arms shipments as civilian goods and using front companies to obscure the true nature of their operations. Unit 700, led by Ali Naji Gal Farsat, focuses on logistics and maritime smuggling routes, facilitating arms deliveries to Hezbollah via the Port of Beirut. These operations have adapted to regional dynamics, shifting from overland routes through Syria to maritime channels to evade detection.\nIn Yemen, Iran's support has significantly enhanced the military capabilities of the Houthi rebels, enabling them to conduct attacks on international shipping and regional adversaries. Despite international sanctions and efforts to curb these activities, Iran continues to provide advanced weaponry and training to the Houthis, contributing to ongoing instability in the region.\nIran has also been implicated in attempts to smuggle weapons into the West Bank, aiming to arm Palestinian factions and foment unrest against Israel. Israeli security forces have intercepted multiple shipments of Iranian-made weapons, including advanced arms intended for terror operatives in the region.\nMyanmar (Burma).\nSince the end of World War II, both the Myanmar military juntas and various rebel groups relied on smuggled arms to equip themselves. During the Cold War, weapons for anti-communist groups (such as the Kuomintang remnants) and the Communist Party of Burma were smuggled with indirect CIA and CCP support via Thailand and China, respectively. After the end of the Vietnam War, AK-47s, M-79 grenade launchers, and M16s began flowing into the hands of rebel groups such as U Nu's Parliamentary Democracy Party.\nMeanwhile, the authoritarian government under Ne Win imported G3 rifles and MG3 machine guns from West Germany in 1962 after student protests were violently suppressed. The State Administration Council junta under Min Aung Hlaing bought weapons and spare parts via Thai and Singapore intermediaries.\nDuring the post-Cold War conflict, smuggled weaponry primarily consists of small arms cloned from the Chinese Type 56 and Type 81 platforms by the Kachin Independence Army and United Wa State Army. After the UWSA announced a restriction of weapons supply on August 28, 2025, speculation arose that this announcement contributed to a spike in black market arms prices. However, various factions still source their weapons from neighboring countries such as Thailand or India.\nNorth Korea.\nNorth Korea, via Room 39, engages in weapons smuggling to increase its foreign currency reserves. One alleged recipient of North Korean weaponry was the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. According to Professor Rohan Gunaratna, several LTTE members claimed that weapons were purchased with payments concluding at the Embassy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in Beijing. Around the same time, the former Sri Lanka Minister of Finance, Basil Rajapaksa supposedly admitted in a newspaper interview that the government bought weapons from North Korea during the Sri Lankan Civil War. Rajapaksa denied making those remarks.\nWhen Panama detained the North Korean cargo ship, Chong Chon Gang, in mid-2013, it carried missile parts and MiG 21 planes from Cuba\nPhilippines.\nDuring the rule of Ferdinand Marcos, the New People's Army attempted to smuggle weapons from China in the MV \"Karagatan\" incident.\nAside from internal theft and cross-border smuggling, criminals and insurgents in the Philippines source weapons from unlicensed workshops making firearms ranging from imitations of the 1911 pistol to single-shot .50 BMG long guns.\nAmericas.\nArgentina.\nUnder the presidency of Carlos Menem, 6,500 tons of weapons, including FAL rifles and howitzers, were smuggled to Croatia and Ecuador during the Yugoslav Wars and Cenepa War, respectively. The end-user certificates listed the destinations as Panama and Venezuela. These arms transfers violated UN arms embargos and peace treaties.\nColombia.\nIn the 1980s Guns for Antigua scandal, the Medellin drug cartel used dubious end-user certificates purportedly meant for the Antigua and Barbuda Defence Force to equip itself with Israeli-made weapons.\nAccording to a 2004 CIA report, FARC acquires its weapons both from Cold War stockpiles in neighboring countries and stolen Colombian Armed Forces inventory.\nUnited States.\nDuring the American Civil War (1861\u20131865), the Confederacy lacked the financial and manufacturing capacity to wage war against the industrial and prosperous North. The Union Navy was enforcing the blockade along 3,500 miles of coast in the Southeast and Gulf of Mexico to prevent the smuggling of any material from or into the South. In order to increase its arsenal, the Confederacy looked to Britain as a major source of arms. British merchants and bankers funded the purchase of arms and construction of ships being outfitted as blockade runners which later carried war supplies bound for Southern ports. The chief figures for these acts were Confederate foreign agents James Dunwoody Bulloch and Charles K. Prioleau and Fraser, Trenholm and Co. based in Liverpool, England and merchants in Glasgow, Scotland. The smuggling of arms into the South by blockade runners carrying British supplies were easily facilitated using ports in the British colonies of Canada and the Bahamas, where the Union Navy could not enter. A British publication in 1862 summed up the country's involvement in blockade running:\nScore after score of the finest, swiftest British steamers and ships, loaded with British material of war of every description, cannon, rifles by the hundreds of thousand, powder by the thousand of tons, shot, shell, cartridges, swords, etc, with cargo after cargo of clothes, boots, shoes, blankets, medicines and supplies of every kind, all paid for by British money, at the sole risk of British adventurers, well insured by Lloyds and under the protection of the British flag, have been sent across the ocean to the insurgents by British agency.\nIt was estimated the Confederates received thousands of tons of gunpowder, half a million rifles, and several hundred cannons from the blockade runners. American politician Charles Sumner claimed after the war that these supplies lengthened the war by two more years.\nUlysses S. Grant III, President of the American Civil War Centennial in 1961, remarked for example:\n[B]etween October 26, 1864 and January 1865, it was still possible for 8,632,000 lbs of meat, 1,507,000 lbs of lead, 1,933,000 lbs of saltpeter, 546,000 pairs of shoes, 316,000 blankets, half a million pounds of coffee, 69,000 rifles, and 43 cannon to run the blockade into the port of Wilmington alone, while cotton sufficient to pay for these purchases was exported[. I]t is evident that the blockade runners made an important contribution to the Confederate effort to carry on.\nIn the United States, the term \"Iron Pipeline\" is sometimes used to describe Interstate Highway 95 and its connector highways as a corridor for arms trafficking into the New York City Metro Area.\nMexico.\nDuring the Mexican Revolution, gunrunning into Mexico reached rampant levels with the majority of the arms being smuggled from the United States. As Mexico manufactured no weapons of its own, acquiring arms and ammunition were one of the main concerns of the various rebels, intent on armed revolution. Under American law at the time, arms smugglers into Mexico could be prosecuted only if one was caught \"in flagrante delicto\" crossing the border as merely buying arms with the intention of gunrunning into Mexico was not a criminal offense. Given the length and often rugged terrain of the American-Mexican border, the undermanned American border service simply could not stop the massive gunrunning into Mexico.\nIn February 1913-February 1914, President Woodrow Wilson imposed an arms embargo on both sides of the Mexican civil war, and not until February 1914 was the embargo lifted on arms sales to the Constitutionalist rebels. Despite the arms embargo, there was much gunrunning into Mexico, as one American official complained in 1913: \"our border towns are practically their commissary and quartermaster depots\". Guns were smuggled into Mexico via barrels, coffins, and false bottoms of automobiles. General Huerta avoided the American arms embargo by buying weapons from Germany.\nIn the Mexican drug war, the primary foreign sources for weaponry are the United States and various countries in Central and South America. In March 1997, customs agents discovered \"two truckloads\" of grenade launchers and M2 carbines in a warehouse at the Port of Long Beach. These weapons were purportedly imported from Vietnam and law enforcement speculated that drug cartels were the recipient. During the controversial Operation Fast and Furious, the ATF attached GPS trackers to firearms before they were straw-purchased to cartels in order to arrest leading figures. Many of the tracking systems were lost, resulting in multiple firearms ending up in the hands of criminal groups.\nAfrica.\nSomalia.\nFrom 1992 to 2023, the United Nations imposed a widespread arms embargo on Somalia after full-scale civil war followed the fall of the Siad Barre regime. In spite of the embargo, weapons were openly sold in markets such as the Bakaara Market; many of the weapons primarily originated from either Transitional Federal Government stocks or Yemen. These firearms ended up in the hands of warlords, the Islamic Courts Union, and Al-Shabaab.\nTomislav Damnjanovi\u0107, a Serbian businessman connected to former president, Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, allegedly sold weapons to the ICU as he was simultaneously contracted to supply US-led Coalition forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nLiberia and Sierra Leone conflicts.\nThe civil war in Sierra Leone lasted from 1991 to 2002, and left 75,000 people dead.\u00a0Gunrunning played a significant role in this conflict.\u00a0Weapons of all sorts were shipped to all sides in both Sierra Leone, and Liberia from abroad.\u00a0These included small arms, such as, pistols, assault rifles, grenades, Claymores, knives, machetes, etc.\u00a0Larger weapons such as missiles, light machine guns, mortars, anti-tank missiles, tanks, and planes were also used. During this time a civil war was occurring in nearby Liberia.\u00a0The Liberian Civil Wars took place from 1989 through 1997.\u00a0The war was between the existing government and the National Patriotic Front.\u00a0Leader of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia, Charles Taylor, helped to create the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) in Sierra Leone.\u00a0Taylor was the recipient of thousands of illegally trafficked arms from eastern Europe (mostly Ukraine).\u00a0Taylor then sold some of these weapons to the RUF in exchange for diamonds. President of Burkina Faso, Blaise Compaore, \"directly facilitated Liberia's arms-for-diamonds trade\" with Liberia and Sierra Leone.\u00a0Compaore would give guns to Taylor, who would then sell them to the RUF in exchange for diamonds.\u00a0These blood diamonds would then be sold back to Compaore for more guns.\u00a0The cyclical exchange allowed Compaore the ability to deny directly sending arms to Sierra Leone.\nThe Liberian government received arms through an elaborate front company in Guinea.\u00a0The arms were intended to be shipped (legally) from Uganda to Slovakia. However, the arms were diverted to Guinea as a part of \"an elaborate bait and switch\". Additionally the British government \"encouraged Sandline International, a private security firm and non state entity, to supply arms and ammunitions to the loyal forces of the exiled government of President Kabbah.\"\u00a0Sandline proceeded 35 tons of arms from Bulgaria, to Kabbah's forces.\nThe South Sudanese civil war.\nEver since the South Sudanese civil war began in December 2013, gunrunning into that nation has reached rampant levels. As South Sudan has hardly any electricity and no manufacturing, both sides were entirely dependent upon buying arms from abroad to fight their war. President Salva Kiir Mayardit used shadowy networks of arms dealers from China, Uganda, Israel, Egypt and Ukraine to arm his forces. As oil companies paid rent for their concessions in South Sudan, the government was able to afford to buy arms on a lavish scale. In June 2014, the government's National Security Service signed a deal worth $264 million US dollars with a Seychelles-based shell company to buy 30 tanks, 50,000 AK-47 assault rifles and 20 million bullets. The owner of the shell company currently remains unknown. In July 2014, the Chinese arms manufacturer Norinco delivered a shipment to South Sudan of 95,000 assault rifles and 20 million rounds of ammunition, supplying enough bullets to kill every person in South Sudan twice over. The American arms dealer and private military contractor, Erik Prince, sold to the government for $43 million three Mi-24 attack helicopters and two L-39 jets together with the services of Hungarian mercenary pilots to operate the aircraft. The majority of the arms supplied to South Sudan from Uganda originated from Romania, Bulgaria and Slovakia, all which are members of the European Union (EU), and were supposed to abide by an EU arms embargo placed on South Sudan in 2011.\nLess is known about the very secretive arms dealers supplying the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Movement-in-Opposition (SPLM-IO) led by Riek Machar other than that the majority of the gunrunners appeared to be European. A rare exception was with the Franco-Polish arms dealer Pierre Dadak who was arrested on 14 July 2016 at his villa in Ibiza on charges of gunrunning into South Sudan. At his villa, the Spanish National Police Corps allege that they found documents showing he was negotiating to sell Machar 40,000 AK-47 assault rifles, 30,000 PKM machine guns and 200,000 boxes of ammunition.\nThe United Nations Panel of Experts on South Sudan in a 2017 report declared: \"Reports from independent sources indicate that the border areas between South Sudan and the Sudan and Uganda remain key entry points for arms, with some unsubstantiated reports of smaller numbers of weapons also crossing into South Sudan from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. There are also persistent reports and public accusations of shipments to forces affiliated with the leadership in Juba from further afield, specifically from Egypt\". The same report stated that a Ukrainian Air Force IL-76 transport jet flew in two L-39 jets to Uganda on 27 January 2017 in the full knowledge the L-39 jets were intended to go on to South Sudan, thereby violating the arms embargo Ukraine had placed on arms sales to South Sudan. In 2018, the United Nations Security Council imposed a worldwide arms embargo on South Sudan, but the embargo has been widely ignored where despite a ceasefire signed the same year, both sides have continued to import arms on a massive scale, suggesting that they are preparing for another bout of the civil war.\nEurope.\nSince 1996, countries throughout Europe have taken notice of arms trafficking. Europe has been an overall large exporter of illicit weapons with the United Kingdom, Germany, and France in the national lead for the most exports. Imports to Europe from 2004 to 2013 have decreased by 25%, with the United Kingdom importing the most overall in Europe. The firearms that are imported and passed around are commonly small arms and lighter weapons (SALW) compared to large machinery, such as tanks and aircraft. The SALW bought in Europe tends to be secondhand weapons that are cheap and regularly available. Gun cultures, such as in Germany, where the \"taken-for-granted cultural practice of carrying a handgun,\" increases illicit SALW because guns are viewed as a way to enhance masculinity and status. In 2000, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) started on regional solutions and security measures to address the firearms trafficking problem.\nNorthern Ireland.\nDuring and after the early 20th-century Irish revolutionary period, both Republican and Unionist factions clandestinely acquired arms from multiple sources. Prior to the Easter Rising , the Imperial German government attempted to smuggle Mosin-Nagant rifles to Irish rebels using the SS Libau ship in 1916, but failed. The more successful 1914 Howth gun-running operation yielded obsolete Mauser M1871 black-powder rifles. During The Troubles, the Provisional IRA implemented a sophisticated weapons smuggling network where small arms were primarily acquired from American sympathisers and the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.\nBefore World War I, the Ulster Unionist Council initiated the Larne gun-running operation in April 1914 where they successfully brought in weapons and weapons from the German Empire using motor vehicles to transport the cargo inland. However, the Unionist arms procurement network during The Troubles faced less success in contrast to the PIRA networks. Although they acquired some weapons from South African arms dealers and sympathizers from abroad, internal theft and improvisation remained a primary source of small arms logistics.\nHezbollah's Europe smuggling network.\nIn 2024-2025 European authorities investigated Hezbollah's drone smuggling network in Europe. This network, developed and operated by Hezbollah with support from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), involved the transnational procurement and logistics of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) components. The smuggling operation spanned several countries, including Spain, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. The investigation resulted in multiple arrests and prosecutions.\nGlobal market value.\nThough one of the least profitable illegal trades, arms trafficking made an estimated $1.7-3.5 billion in 2014, making it the 9th largest criminal market, which was valued at $1.6-2.2 trillion.\nThe AK-47 is one of the most appealing weapons in the illegal weapons trade due to its low cost and reliability. In Iraq, a smuggled AK-47 typically costs $150\u2013300. In the first sixth months of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the influx of new weapons lowered the AK-47's price, to the point the weapon was sold for as low as $25, or sometimes, nothing. Comparatively, AK-47s sold on the Dark web in the United States can cost as much as $3,600, as the price of illegal arms is increased greatly by the distance it must travel, due to the induced risk. A handgun trafficked from the United States to Canada can have its price increase by 560% from just crossing the border. Weapons smuggled overseas will usually take several, short trips with multiple companies to mask the country of origin and the original sellers.\nIn the United States, biker gangs have been connected to arms trafficking. United States law enforcement agencies started investigating bike gangs in the late 90s, and started classifying them as organized criminal organizations. This was mainly due to the fact that they were able to get control of the prostitution market and the smuggling of stolen goods such as weapons, motorcycles, and car parts.\nRegulation.\nProsecuting arms traffickers and brokers has proven difficult due to loopholes in national laws. In 2000, Israeli arms dealer Leonid Minin was arrested in Italy for drug possession, and while serving his sentence, Italian police found over 1,500 pages of forged end-user certificates and transfers of money which implicated him in trafficking arms to the Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone. Minin was released in December 2002, as according to Italian law, he could not be tried because the weapons he had sold had never reached Italy. Additionally, some arms dealers will operate in countries where they cannot be extradited. Arms traffickers are also able to evade capture due to a lack of co-operation between nations, especially in Africa and ex-Soviet states.\nRelated theories.\nIn the international criminal scholarly community, rational choice theory is commonly referenced in explanations as to why individuals engage in and justify criminal activity. According to Jana Arsovska and Panos Kostakos, leading scholars on organized crime, the causes of arms trafficking are not solely based on rational choice theory but rather have been more closely linked to the intimacy of one's personal social networks as well as the \"perception of risks, effort and rewards in violating criminal laws.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He shared the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physics for the development of the semiconductor heterojunction for optoelectronics. He also became a politician in his later life, serving in the lower house of the Russian parliament, the State Duma, as a member of the Communist Party from 1995.\nEarly life and education.\nAlferov was born in Vitebsk, Byelorussian SSR, Soviet Union, to a Russian father, Ivan Karpovich Alferov, a factory manager, and a Jewish mother, Anna Vladimirovna Rosenblum. He was named after French socialist Jean Jaur\u00e8s while his older brother was named Marx after Karl Marx. Alferov graduated from secondary school in Minsk in 1947 and enrolled in the Belarusian Polytechnic Academy. In 1952, he received his B.S. from the V. I. Ulyanov (Lenin) Electrotechnical Institute (LETI) in Leningrad. Starting in 1953, Alferov worked in the Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union. From the institute, he earned several scientific degrees: a Candidate of Sciences in Technology in 1961 and a Doctor of Sciences in Physics and Mathematics in 1970.\nAlferov then served as the director of the Ioffe Institute from 1987 to 2003. He was elected a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union in 1972, and a full member in 1979. From 1989, he was Vice-President of the USSR Academy of Sciences and President of its Saint Petersburg Scientific Center. \nResearch.\nStarting at Ioffe Institute in 1953, Alferov worked with a group led by Vladimir Tuchkevich, who became director of the Ioffe Institute in 1967, on planar semiconductor amplifiers for use in radio receivers. These planar semiconductor amplifiers would be referred to as transistors in the present day. Alferov's contribution included work on germanium diodes for use as a rectifier.\nIn the early 1960s, Alferov organized an effort at Ioffe Institute to develop semiconductor heterostructures. Semiconductor heterojunctions transistors enabled higher frequency use than their homojunction predecessors, and this capability plays a key role in modern mobile phone and satellite communications. Alferov and colleagues worked on GaAs and AlAs III-V heterojunctions. A particular focus was the use of heterojunctions to create semiconductor lasers capable of lasing at room temperature. In 1963, Alferov filed a patent application proposing double-heterostructure lasers; Herbert Kroemer independently filed a US patent several months later. In 1966, Alferov's lab created the first lasers based on heterostructures, although they did not lase continuously. Then in 1968, Alferov and coworkers produced the first continuous-wave semiconductor heterojunction laser operating at room temperature. This achievement came a month ahead of Izuo Hayashi and Morton Panish of Bell Labs also producing a continuous-wave room-temperature heterojunction laser.\nIt was for this work that Alferov received the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physics together with Herbert Kroemer, \"for developing semiconductor heterostructures used in high-speed- and optoelectronics\".\nIn the 1960s and 1970s Alferov continued his work on the physics and technology of semiconductor heterostructures in his lab at the Ioffe Institute. Alferov's investigations of injection properties of semiconductors and his contributions to the development of lasers, solar cells, LEDs, and epitaxy processes, led to the creation of modern heterojunction physics and electronics. The development of semiconductor heterojunctions revolutionized semiconductor design, and had a range of immediate commercial applications including LEDs, barcode readers and CDs. Hermann Grimmeiss of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards Nobel prizes, said: \"Without Alferov, it would not be possible to transfer all the information from satellites down to the Earth or to have so many telephone lines between cities.\"\nAlferov had an almost messianic conception of heterostructures, writing: \"Many scientists have contributed to this remarkable progress, which not only determines in large measure the future prospects of solid state physics but in a certain sense affects the future of human society as well.\"\nScientific administration.\nIn 1987, Alferov became the fifth director of the Ioffe Institute. In 1989, Alferov gained the administrative position of chairman of the Leningrad Scientific Center, now referred to as the St. Petersburg Scientific Center. In the Leningrad region, this scientific center is an overarching organization comprising 70 institutions, organizations, enterprises, and scientific societies.\nAlferov worked to foster relationships between early educational institutions and scientific research institutions to train the next generation of scientists, citing Peter the Great's vision for the Russian Academy of Sciences to be organized with a scientific research core in close contact with a gymnasium (secondary school). In 1987, Alferov and colleagues at the Ioffe Institute established a secondary school in Saint Petersburg, the School of Physics and Technology, under the umbrella of the Ioffe charter. In 1997 Alferov founded the Research and Education Center at the Ioffe Institute and in 2002, this center officially became the Saint Petersburg Academic University after gaining a charter to award masters and PhD degrees.\nIn the 2000s, through his role in academic administration and in parliament, Alferov advocated for and worked to advance Russia's nanotechnology sector. The primary research charter of the Saint Petersburg Academic University, which Alferov founded, was the development of nanotechnology. Alferov provided a consistent voice in parliament in favor of increased scientific funding. In 2006, Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov announced the creation of a federal agency, Rosnanotekh to pursue nanotechnology applications.\nPolitical activity.\nAlferov was elected to the Russian Parliament, the State Duma, in 1995 as a deputy for the political party Our Home \u2013 Russia, generally considered to be supportive of the policies of President Boris Yeltsin. In 1999 he was elected again, this time on the list of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. He was re-elected in 2003 and again in 2007, when he was placed second on the party's federal electoral list behind Gennady Zyuganov and ahead of Nikolai Kharitonov, even though he was not a member of the party.\nNon-profit service.\nAlferov served on the advisory council of CRDF Global.\nIllness and death.\nSince November 2018, Alferov suffered from hypertensive emergency. He died at the age of 88 on 1 March 2019. \nPersonal life.\nAlferov's wife was named Tamara Darskaya. Together they had two children, a son Ivan and a daughter Olga.\nAlferov was an atheist and expressed objections to religious education. He was one of the signers of the open letter to President Vladimir Putin from members of the Russian Academy of Sciences against clericalisation of Russia.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Yaroslav ruled the northern lands around Rostov before being transferred to Novgorod in 1010. He had a strained relationship with his father and refused to pay tribute to Kiev in 1014. Following Vladimir's death in 1015, Yaroslav waged a complicated war for the Kievan throne against his half-brother Sviatopolk, ultimately emerging victorious in 1019.\nAs the Grand Prince of Kiev, Yaroslav focused on foreign policy, forming alliances with Scandinavian countries and weakening Byzantine influence on Kiev. He successfully captured the area around present-day Tartu, Estonia, establishing the fort of Yuryev, and forced nearby regions to pay tribute. Yaroslav also defended his state against nomadic tribes such as the Pechenegs by constructing a line of forts. He was a patron of literary culture, sponsoring the construction of Saint Sophia Cathedral in 1037 and promoting the first work of Old East Slavic literature by Hilarion of Kiev.\nYaroslav married Ingegerd Olofsdotter in 1019 and had several children who married into foreign royal families. His children from his second marriage went on to rule various parts of Kievan Rus'. Yaroslav was known for promoting unity among his children and emphasizing the importance of living in peace. After his death, his body was placed in a sarcophagus within Saint Sophia's Cathedral, but his remains were later lost or stolen. Yaroslav's legacy includes founding several towns and having numerous monuments and institutions named after him.\nRise to the throne.\nThe early years of Yaroslav's life are mostly unknown. He was one of the numerous sons of Vladimir the Great, presumably his second by Rogneda of Polotsk, although his actual age (as stated in the \"Primary Chronicle\" and corroborated by the examination of his skeleton in the 1930s) would place him among the youngest children of Vladimir.\nIt has been suggested that he was a child begotten out of wedlock after Vladimir's divorce from Rogneda and marriage to Anna Porphyrogenita, or even that he was a child of Anna Porphyrogenita herself. French historian argues that he was indeed Anna's son, as this would explain his interference in Byzantine affairs in 1043. William Humphreys also favors a reconstruction making Yaroslav the son, rather than the step-son, of Anna, by invoking onomastic arguments. It is curious that Yaroslav named his elder son Vladimir (after his own father) and one of his daughters Anna (as if after his own mother). There is a certain pattern in his sons having Slavic names, and his daughters having Greek names only. Furthermore, Yaroslav's maternity by Rogneda of Polotsk had been questioned by Mykola Kostomarov in the 19th century. \nYaroslav figures prominently in the Norse sagas under the name Jarisleif the Lame; his legendary lameness (probably resulting from an arrow wound) was corroborated by the scientists who examined his remains.\nIn his youth, Yaroslav was sent by his father to rule the northern lands around Rostov. He was transferred to Veliky Novgorod, as befitted a senior heir to the throne, in 1010. While living there, he founded the town of Yaroslavl (literally, \"Yaroslav's\") on the Volga River. His relations with his father were apparently strained, and grew only worse on the news that Vladimir bequeathed the Kievan throne to his younger son, Boris. Yaroslav refused to pay tribute to Kiev in 1014 and brought over Varangians from overseas, with only Vladimir's illness and subsequent death in July 1015 preventing a war.\nDuring the next four years Yaroslav waged a complicated and bloody war for Kiev against his half-brother Sviatopolk I of Kiev, who was supported by his father-in-law, Duke Boles\u0142aw I the Brave (King of Poland from 1025). During the course of this struggle, several other brothers (Boris, Gleb, and Svyatoslav) were brutally murdered.&lt;/ref&gt; The \"Primary Chronicle\" accused Sviatopolk of planning those murders. The saga is often interpreted as recounting the story of Boris' assassination by the Varangians in the service of Yaroslav.\nHowever, the victim's name is given there as \"Burizaf\", which is also a name of Boleslaus I in the Scandinavian sources. It is thus possible that the Saga tells the story of Yaroslav's struggle against Sviatopolk (whose troops were commanded by the Polish duke), and not against Boris.\nYaroslav defeated Sviatopolk in their first battle, in 1016, and Sviatopolk fled to Poland. Sviatopolk returned in 1018 with Polish troops furnished by his father-in-law, seized Kiev, and pushed Yaroslav back into Novgorod. Yaroslav prevailed over Sviatopolk, and in 1019 firmly established his rule over Kiev. One of his first actions as a grand prince was to confer on the loyal Novgorodians, who had helped him to gain the Kievan throne, numerous freedoms and privileges.\nThus, the foundation of the Novgorod Republic was laid. For their part, the Novgorodians respected Yaroslav more than they did other Kievan princes; and the princely residence in their city, next to the marketplace (and where the often convened) was named Yaroslav's Court after him. It probably was during this period that Yaroslav promulgated the first code of laws in the lands of the East Slavs, the .\nReign.\nPower struggles between siblings.\nLeaving aside the legitimacy of Yaroslav's claims to the Kievan throne and his postulated guilt in the murder of his brothers, Nestor the Chronicler and later Russian historians often presented him as a model of virtue, styling him \"the Wise\". A less appealing side of his personality is revealed by his having imprisoned his youngest brother Sudislav for life. In response, another brother, Mstislav of Chernigov, whose distant realm bordered the North Caucasus and the Black Sea, hastened to Kiev.\nDespite reinforcements led by Yaroslav's brother-in-law King Anund Jacob of Sweden (as \"Yakun\" - \"blind and dressed in a gold suit\" or \"handsome and dressed in a gold suit\") Mstislav inflicted a heavy defeat on Yaroslav in 1024. Yaroslav and Mstislav then divided Kievan Rus' between them: the area stretched east from the Dnieper River, with the capital at Chernigov, was ceded to Mstislav until his death in 1036.\nAllies along the Baltic coast.\nIn his foreign policy, Yaroslav relied on a Scandinavian alliance and attempted to weaken the Byzantine influence on Kiev. According to \"Heimskringla\", Olaf the Swede made an alliance with Yaroslav, even though the alliance was not liked in Sweden, in order to declare war against Olaf II of Norway. This was sealed in 1019 when King Olof of Sweden married his daughter to Yaroslav instead of the Norwegian king. That led to protests in Sweden because the Swedes wanted to reestablish control over their lost eastern territories and bring in tribute from Kievan Rus', as his father Eric the Victorious had, but after years of war against Norway, Sweden no longer had the power to collect regular tributes from Kievan Rus', according to \"Heimskringla\". In 1022 Olaf was deposed and forced to give power to his son Anund Jakob.\nHe defended the Eastern countries from invaders, ensuring Swedish military interests.\nIn a successful military raid in 1030, he captured Tartu, Estonia and renamed it Yuryev (named after Yury, Yaroslav's patron saint) and forced the surrounding Ugandi County to pay annual tribute.\nIn 1031, he conquered Cherven cities from the Poles followed by the construction of Sutiejsk to guard the newly acquired lands. In c.1034 Yaroslav concluded an alliance with Polish King Casimir I the Restorer, sealed by the latter's marriage to Yaroslav's sister, Maria.\nYaroslav's eldest son, Vladimir, ruled in Novgorod from 1034 and supervised relations in the north.\nLater in Yaroslav's reign, around c.1035, Ingvar the Far-Travelled, Anund Jakob's jarl, sent Swedish soldiers into Kievan Rus due to Olof's son wanting to assist his father's ally Yaroslav in his wars against the Pechenegs and Byzantines. Later, in c.1041 Anund Jakob tried to reestablish Swedish control over the Eastern trade routes and reopen them. The Georgian annals report 1000 men coming into Georgia but the original force was likely much larger, around 3,000 men.\nIngvar's fate is unknown, but he was likely captured in battle during the Byzantine campaigns or killed, supposedly in 1041. Only one ship returned to Sweden, according to the legend.\nCampaign against Byzantium.\nYaroslav presented his second direct challenge to Constantinople in 1043, when a Rus' flotilla headed by one of his sons appeared near Constantinople and demanded money, threatening to attack the city otherwise. Whatever the reason, the Byzantines refused to pay and preferred to fight. The Rus' flotilla defeated the Byzantine fleet but was almost destroyed by a storm and came back to Kiev empty-handed.\nProtecting the inhabitants of the Dnieper from the Pechenegs.\nTo defend his state from the Pechenegs and other nomadic tribes threatening it from the south he constructed a line of forts, composed of Yuriev, Bohuslav, Kaniv, Korsun, and Pereyaslavl. To celebrate his decisive victory over the Pechenegs in 1036, who thereafter were never a threat to Kiev, he sponsored the construction of the Saint Sophia Cathedral in 1037.\nIn 1037 the were built, named after patron saints of Yaroslav and his wife. Some mentioned and other celebrated monuments of his reign such as the Golden Gate of Kiev were destroyed during the Mongol invasion of Rus', but later restored.\nEstablishment of law.\nYaroslav was a notable patron of literary culture and learning. In 1051, he had a Slavic monk, Hilarion of Kiev, proclaimed the metropolitan bishop of Kiev, thus challenging the Byzantine tradition of placing Greeks on the episcopal sees. Hilarion's discourse on Yaroslav and his father Vladimir is frequently cited as the first work of Old East Slavic literature.\nFamily life and posterity.\nIn 1019, Yaroslav married Ingegerd Olofsdotter, daughter of Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung, the king of Sweden. He gave Ladoga to her as a marriage gift.\nSaint Sophia's Cathedral in Kiev houses a fresco representing the whole family: Yaroslav, Irene (as Ingegerd was known in Rus'), their four daughters and six sons. Yaroslav had at least three of his daughters married to foreign princes who lived in exile at his court:\nYaroslav had one son from the first marriage (his Christian name being Ilya (?\u20131020)), and six sons from the second marriage. Apprehending the danger that could ensue from divisions between brothers, he exhorted them to live in peace with each other. The eldest of these, Vladimir of Novgorod, best remembered for building the Cathedral of St. Sophia, Novgorod, predeceased his father. Vladimir succeeded Yaroslav as prince of Novgorod in 1034.\nThree other sons\u2014Iziaslav I, Sviatoslav II, and Vsevolod I\u2014reigned in Kiev one after another. The youngest children of Yaroslav were Igor Yaroslavich (1036\u20131060) of Volhynia and Vyacheslav Yaroslavich (1036\u20131057) of the Principality of Smolensk. There is almost no information about Vyacheslav. Some documents point out the fact of him having a son, Boris Vyacheslavich, who challenged Vsevolod I sometime in 1077\u20131078.\nGrave.\nFollowing his death, the body of Yaroslav the Wise was entombed in a white marble sarcophagus within Saint Sophia's Cathedral. In 1936, the sarcophagus was opened and found to contain the skeletal remains of two individuals, one male and one female. The male was determined to be Yaroslav. The identity of the female was never established, though some believe them to be those of Yaroslav's spouse Ingegerd. The sarcophagus was again opened in 1939 and the remains removed for research, not being documented as returned until 1964.\nIn 2009, the sarcophagus was opened and surprisingly found to contain only one skeleton, that of a female. It seems the documents detailing the 1964 reinterment of the remains were falsified to hide the fact that Yaroslav's remains had been lost. Subsequent questioning of individuals involved in the research and reinterment of the remains seems to point to the idea that Yaroslav's remains were purposely hidden prior to the German occupation of Ukraine and then either lost completely or stolen and transported to the United States, where many ancient religious artifacts were placed to avoid \"mistreatment\" by the communists.\nLegacy.\nFour towns in four countries were named after Yaroslav, three of which he also founded: Yaroslavl (in today's Russia), Jaros\u0142aw in Poland, Yuryev (now Bila Tserkva, Ukraine), and another Yuryev in place of conquered Tarbatu (now Tartu) between 1030 and 1061 in Estonia. Following the Russian custom of naming military objects such as tanks and planes after historical figures, the helmet worn by many Russian soldiers during the Crimean War was called the \"Helmet of Yaroslav the Wise\". It was the first pointed helmet to be used by a modern army, even before German troops wore pointed helmets.\nIn 2008 Yaroslav was placed first (with 40% of the votes) in their ranking of \"our greatest compatriots\" by the viewers of the TV show . Afterwards, one of the producers of The Greatest Ukrainians claimed that Yaroslav had only won because of vote manipulation and that (if that had been prevented) the real first place would have been awarded to Stepan Bandera.\nIn 2003, a monument to Yaroslav the Wise was erected in Kyiv, Ukraine. The creators of the monument are Boris Krylov and Oles Sydoruk. Various streets are named after the prince in cities throughout Ukraine including Yaroslavska Street and Yaroslaviv Val in Kyiv.\nThe Yaroslav Mudryi National Law University in Kharkiv is named after him.\n\"Iron Lord\" was a 2010 feature film based on Yaroslav's early life as a regional prince on the frontier.\nOn December 12, 2022, on the Constitution Day of the Russian Federation, a monument to Yaroslav the Wise was unveiled at the site near the Novgorod Technical School. The author of the monument is sculptor Sergey Gaev.\nVeneration.\nYaroslav was at the earliest named a saint by Adam of Bremen in his \"Deeds of Bishops of the Hamburg Church\" in 1075, but he was not formally canonized. On 9 March 2004, on his 950th death anniversary he was included in the calendar of saints of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate). On 8 December 2005, Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow added his name to the Menologium as a local saint. On 3 February 2016, the Council of Bishops of the Russian Orthodox Church held in Moscow established church-wide veneration of \"Saint Blessed Knyaz Yaroslav the Wise\", noticing that he was one of the saints widely venerated in the Russian Orthodox Church, but missing from the official church-wide veneration.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This Estrid was the maternal grandmother of the chieftain Jarlabanke of the Jarlabanke clan. The family were rich landowners and belonged to the higher echelons of Swedish society. Her family saga has been the centre of a dramatisation at the Stockholm County Museum. \nIt is safe to assume that five of the 11 runestones that mention an Estrid in eastern Svealand refer to this Estrid because of the locations of the runestones and the people who are mentioned on them.\nA sixth runestone, U 329, deals with an Estrid who is only mentioned as the sister of a Ragnfast and a Gyrid. This Ragnfast appears on the Hillersj\u00f6 stone and the Snottsta and Vreta stones as the husband of Inga and the son-in-law of Gerl\u00f6g. Since Fot, the runemaster of U 329, also made runestones for the Jarlabanke clan, and Gerl\u00f6g and Inga also belonged to the same regional elite, it is probable that U 329 refers to the same Estrid as the five other runestones. This would mean that Estrid was born in Snottsta (also spelled Sn\u00e5ttsta) as the daughter of the rich landowner Sigfast. \nThe Broby bro Runestones tell that Estrid and her husband \u00d6sten had a son by the name Gag, who died while \u00d6sten still was alive, and three other sons named Ingefast, \u00d6sten and Sven. The runestones further tell that a barrow and a bridge were built and that two of the runestones were raised by the brothers Ingefast, \u00d6sten and Sven in memory of their father \u00d6sten, who had gone to Jerusalem and died in the Byzantine Empire.\nThe story of her life is continued on the Hargs bro runic inscriptions, where we learn that Estrid had married a man named Ingvar, and this Ingvar had a son prior to marrying Estrid whose name was Ragnvald. It also appears that Estrid and Ingvar had three sons named Sigvid, Ingvar and Jarlabanke. We further learn that Estrid had a bridge constructed, which apparently was a tradition in her family.\nShe appears to have become quite old and moved back to T\u00e4by where she had family, because the last chapter of her life is documented on two runestones in south-western T\u00e4by. They tell that Estrid cleared a road and built bridges together with her grandson Jarlabanke (by her son Ingefast) and his family, and she dedicated the constructions to her sons Ingvar (her son with Ingvarr at Harg) and Ingefast (her son with \u00d6sten at Broby bro).\nWhen Stockholm County Museum made an archaeological excavation at Broby bro, in 1995, they found three graves. The three were buried in Christian manner, i.e. with the head towards the west, they were not burned and there were few gifts. Some coins that were found helped to date the graves to the 11th century. One of the graves was located just beside \u00d6sten's barrow and it was for a rich and very old woman. The buried woman was probably Estrid."}

The method is generally not considered suitable for no trump or misfit hands; also, the trump suit is generally considered to require at least eight cards in length with no partner holding fewer than three.\nHowever, the LTC method of hand evaluation has been used successfully to evaluate unbalanced and balanced opening hands, and overcalls, since 1938 (combined with \u2018quick trick\u2019 evaluation and defined biddable suits), and by itself since 2017, before a fit and trump suit have been established based on the premise that a fit could usually be found later.\nBased on a set of empirical rules, the number of \"losing tricks\" held in each of the partnership's hands is estimated and their sum deducted from either 24 (the result is the number of tricks the partnership can expect to take when playing in their established suit, assuming normal suit distributions and assuming required finesses work about half the time) or 18 (the result is the bidding level the partnership can expect to make their contract when playing in their established suit, assuming normal suit distributions and assuming required finesses work about half the time). F. Dudley Courtenay originally referred to the latter option as the \u201cRule of 18\u201d.\nHistory.\nThe origins of the Losing Trick Count (LTC)\u2014without that name\u2014can be traced back at least to 1910 in Joseph Bowne Elwell's book \"Elwell on Auction Bridge\" wherein he sets out, in tabular form, a scheme for counting losers in trump contracts similar to the basic counting method given below.\nThe term \"Losing Trick Count\" was originally put forward by the American F. Dudley Courtenay in his 1934 book \"The System the Experts Play\" (which ran to at least 21 printing editions). Among various acknowledgments, the author writes: 'To Mr. Arnold Fraser-Campbell the author is particularly indebted for permission to use material and quotations from his manuscript in which is described his method of hand valuation by counting losing tricks, and from which the author has developed the Losing Trick Count described herein.'\nThe Englishman George Walshe and Courtenay edited the American edition and retitled it \"The Losing Trick Count\" for the British market; first published in London in 1935, the ninth edition came out in 1947. Subsequently, it has been republished by print-on-demand re-publishers.\nThe LTC was also popularised by Maurice Harrison-Gray in \"Country Life\" magazine in the 1950s and 1960s. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In its original British edition of years before, it had not been very lucidly presented, and it seemed to suffer from a certain wooliness of definition of some of its concepts... With the blessing of Mr. Courtenay, Gray sharpened up the definitions, plugged some holes in the logic, and made the whole conception intelligible to the average player.\u2014\u200a\nIn recent decades, others have suggested refinements to the basic counting method.\nThe original LTC.\nThe underlying premise of LTC is that if a suit is evenly distributed, i.e. three players hold three cards in the suit and one player holds four, a maximum of three losers can be assumed in any one suit held by the partnership and, in turn, the maximum number of losers held by the partnership in all four suits is 24 (three in each of the four suits in each of two hands, i.e. 3 x 4 x 2 = 24). The LTC method estimates the total number of losers held by the partnership and deducts that total from either 24 to estimate the number of tricks which the partnership may expect to win or 18 to estimate the bidding level the partnership may expect to make their contract. Using either of the LTC method options thus provides guidance as to how high to bid in the auction.\nMethodology.\nThe basic LTC methodology consists of three steps:\nExample.\nYou hold and partner opens 1&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2665. If playing five-card majors, you know you have at least an 8 card heart fit.\nAt this stage in the bidding, one estimates that the partnership can take at least 10 tricks and bid to the 4 level.\nRefinements.\nThinking that the method tended to overvalue unsupported queens and undervalue supported jacks, Eric Crowhurst and Andrew Kambites refined the scale, as have others:\nIn his book \"The Modern Losing Trick Count\", Ron Klinger advocates adjusting the number of losers based on the control count of the hand believing that the basic method undervalues an ace but overvalues a queen and undervalues short honor combinations such as Qx or a singleton king. Also it places no value on cards jack or lower.\nNew Losing-Trick Count (NLTC).\nA \"New\" Losing-Trick Count (NLTC) was introduced in \"The Bridge World\", May 2003, by Johannes Koelman. Designed to be more precise than LTC, the NLTC method of hand evaluation utilizes the concept of \"half-losers\", and it distinguishes between 'missing-Ace losers', 'missing-King losers' and 'missing-Queen losers.' NLTC intrinsically assigns greater value to Aces than it assigns to Kings, and it assigns greater value to Kings than it assigns to Queens. Some users of LTC make adjustments to the loser count to compensate for the imbalance of Aces and Queens held. Koelman argues that adjusting a hand's value for the imbalance between Aces and Queens \"held\" isn't the same as correcting for the imbalance between Aces and Queens \"missing\". Because of singletons and doubletons [and because losing-trick counts assign losers for the first three rounds of a suit], the number of losers from missing Aces tends to be greater than the number of losers from missing Queens.\nNLTC differs from LTC in two significant ways. First, NLTC uses a different method to count losers (explanation and loser-count lists below). Consequently, with NLTC, the number of losers in a singleton or doubleton suit can exceed the number of cards in the suit. Second, with NLTC the number of combined losers between two hands is subtracted from 25, not from 24 (explanation below), to predict the number of tricks the two hands will produce when declarer plays the hand in the agreed trump suit. As with LTC, the NLTC formula assumes normal suit breaks, it assumes that required finesses work about half the time, and it must only be applied after an 8-card trump fit or better is discovered. When counting NLTC losers in a hand, consider only the three highest ranking cards in each suit:\nThe following hands highlight the differences between the LTC and NLTC methods:\n - 8 LTC losers, but only 6 NLTC losers&lt;br&gt; \n - 8 LTC losers, and also 8 NLTC losers&lt;br&gt;\n - only 8 LTC losers, but 10 NLTC losers\nHere is the basic NLTC list. For simplicity, cards below the rank of Queen are represented by \"x\":\nAll singletons, except singleton A, are initially counted as 1.5 losers, and all doubletons that are missing both the A and K are initially counted as 2.5 losers. Professional bridge player, Kevin Wilson, explains this concept of a suit that contains more losers than it contains cards: \"Think about how much of declarer play is about timing. When you're missing an Ace, you're losing more than just a trick; you're losing \"timing\" because the King, Queen and Jack that you might hold can't score immediate tricks. First you must force out the Ace [and when the opponents win their Ace, they might immediately score more tricks, or they might establish winning tricks for later in the play]. The idea of 1.5 losers for a singleton [and 2.5 losers for a doubleton] should be within your grasp.\" In Kevin's article, he coins the term \"modified\" losing-trick count, or MLTC.\nAs with LTC, players seeking greater accuracy can also make adjustments to the NLTC. While the LTC normally uses only whole numbers and players who adjust with LTC commonly adjust in \u00bd-loser increments, because NLTC uses fractions already, adjustments are usually made in \u00bc-loser increments or smaller. Players might prefer to adjust for the presence of Jacks and Tens, as these honor cards are assigned no value in the NLTC, but they're valuable holdings, particularly when they're together in the same suit, and especially when they're together and they support higher honors in the suit. Similarly, players might prefer to consider a singleton King as being more valuable than a singleton 2. As with other methods of evaluation, players can upgrade or downgrade the value of a given holding based on the ensuing auction.\nAs previously stated, NLTC uses a value of 25 (instead of 24 with LTC) in the formula for determining the trick-taking potential for two hands. Here's a basic pair of hands that helps illustrate why:\n\u2660 xxxx\n\u2665 xxx\n\u2666 xxx\n\u2663 xxx\n\u2660 xxxx\n\u2665 xxx\n\u2666 xxx\n\u2663 xxx\nWith both LTC and NLTC, the combined loser count with these two very weak and flat-shaped hands is 24 (12 losers in each hand). According to the LTC formula, there is no trick-taking potential with these hands (24-24 combined losers = 0 winning tricks). We must remember, however, that both forms of the losing-trick count are used only after the partnership knows it has an 8-card fit or better. In addition, losing-trick count predictions assume that all suits will break normally. In this example, given we possess an 8-card spade fit, and assuming the outstanding spades (trumps) split 3-2, the defenders can't prevent the (hypothetical) declarer from scoring one trump trick with these otherwise worthless hands. A losing-trick count formula that doesn't predict one winning trick with these two hands poses a theoretical concern. With NLTC we deduct the total combined losers from 25, not from 24, so the NLTC formula accurately predicts the trick-taking potential of these two hands (25-24 losers = 1 winner).\nIt's worth noting that these two example hands are flat shaped and are therefore poorly suited to considering losing trick counts, as losing-trick counts are not designed for notrump hand evaluation. Instead, losing-trick counts are intended primarily for suit contract evaluations, particularly when one or both hands are unbalanced. Indeed, when one partner has 12 losers - which can only occur with 4333 shape - basic LTC can't predict 13 tricks. NLTC however can predict a grand slam with balanced hands (examples below). For more information about NLTC, including new losing-trick counts in balanced hands, refer to Lawrence Diamond's \"Mastering Hand Evaluation\".\nAlso similar to basic LTC, NLTC users may employ an alternate formula to determine the appropriate contract level for two fitting hands. The NLTC alternate formula is: 19 (instead of 18 with LTC) minus the sum of the losers in the two hands = the projected safe contract level when declarer plays the hand in the agreed trump suit. So, 7.5 losers opposite 7.5 losers leads to: 19-(7.5+7.5) = 19-15 = 4 (4-level contract). Players who use the basic LTC variation of this formula (i.e. 18 - total combined losers = suggested safe contract level) will recognize the difference between 25 and 19 as the number of tricks required by declarer to secure a \"book\", which is 6.\nSo, with 6.5 losers opposite 9.5 losers, we would calculate (19-16) = 3-level contract, or (25-16) = 9 tricks. With 4.5 losers opposite 7.5 losers: (19-12) = 7-level contract, or (25-12) = 13 tricks. This can help guide the bidding, as a standard opening hand typically has no more than 7.5 losers, and a typical hand with enough strength to respond typically has no more than 9.5 losers. So, when an 8-card or longer major-suit fit has been established, if the opening bidder holds a hand that has one less loser than a minimum opening hand, then opener can safely invite to game and bid to the three-level. If opener holds a hand that has two fewer losers than a minimum opening hand, then opener can force to game.\nIf an uncontested auction has proceeded as 1D-1H, then opener with four-card heart support would act according to the following guidelines:\nNext consider responder's hand. Opposite partner's 1H or 1S opening, with 3-card support, responder knows an 8+ fit exists and can bid according to the following table:\nN.B. since this response system focuses on major-fits, it can be seen that to reach a minor-suit game at the 5-level, the hand must have one less loser for each of the above-listed actions.\nThe NLTC solves the problem that the LTC method underestimates the trick taking potential by one on hands with a balance between 'ace-losers' and 'queen-losers'. For instance, the LTC can never predict a grand slam when both hands are 4333 distribution:\nwill yield 13 tricks when played in spades on around 95% of occasions (failing only on a 5:0 trump break or on a ruff of the lead from a 7-card suit). However this combination is valued as only 12 tricks using the basic method (24 minus 4 and 8 losers = 12 tricks); whereas using the NLTC it is valued at 13 tricks (25 minus 12/2 and 12/2 losers = 13 tricks). Note, if the west hand happens to hold a small spade instead of the jack, both the LTC as well as the NLTC count would remain unchanged, whilst the chance of making 13 tricks falls to 67%.\nThe NLTC also helps to prevent overstatement on hands which are missing aces. For example: \nwill yield 10 tricks. The NLTC predicts this accurately (13/2 + 17/2 = 15 losers, subtracted from 25 = 10 tricks); whereas the basic LTC predicts 12 tricks (5 + 7 = 12 losers, subtracted from 24 = 12).\nFurther bidding.\nWhichever method is being used, utilizing LTC evaluation need not stop after the opening bid and the response. Assuming opener bids 1&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2665 and partner responds 2&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2665; opener will know from this bid that partner has 9 losers (using basic LTC), if opener has 5 losers rather than the systemically assumed 7, then the calculation changes to (5 + 9 = 14 deducted from 24 = 10) and game becomes apparent!\nA small number of modern bidding systems systemically utilize multiple responses and rebids after the opening bid to refine LTC evaluation and to allow further adjustments to be made based on combined suit length, shortages found, and high cards held. The Imperspicuity losing trick count bridge bidding system uses the Law of Total Losers, shape asking relay bidding, loser asking relay bidding, CROSS and CRO relay bidding, and LTC techniques, to systemically determine the final bidding level, after opening bids and overcalls are initially made based on LTC evaluation methods.\nLimitations of the method.\nAll LTC methods are only valid if trump fit (4-4, 5-3 or better) is evident and, even then, care is required to avoid counting double values in the same suit e.g. KQxx (1 loser in LTC) opposite a singleton x (also 1 loser in LTC).\nRegardless which hand evaluation is used (HCP, LTC, NLTC, etc.) without the partners exchanging information about specific suit strengths and suit lengths, a suboptimal evaluation of the trick taking potential of the combined hands will often result. Consider the examples:\nBoth layouts are the same, except for the swapping of West's minor suits. So in both cases East and West have exactly the same strength in terms of HCP, LTC, NLTC etc. Yet, the layout on the left may be expected to produce 10 tricks in spades, whilst on a bad day the layout to the right would even fail to produce 9 tricks.\nThe difference between the two layouts is that on the left the high cards in the minor suits of both hands work in combination, whilst on the right hand side the minor suit honours fail to do so. Obviously on hands like these, it does not suffice to evaluate each hand individually. When inviting for game, both partners need to communicate in which suit they can provide assistance in the form of high cards, and adjust their hand evaluations accordingly. Conventional agreements like helpsuit trials and short suit trials are available for this purpose.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The fair, registered under the Bureau International des Expositions (BIE), celebrated the city's centennial. Designed largely in Art Deco style, the theme of the fair was technological innovation, and its motto was \"Science Finds, Industry Applies, Man Conforms\", trumpeting the message that science and American life were wedded. Its architectural symbol was the Sky Ride, a transporter bridge perpendicular to the shore on which one could ride from one side of the fair to the other.\nOne description of the fair noted that the world, \"then still mired in the malaise of the Great Depression, could glimpse a happier not-too-distant future, all driven by innovation in science and technology\". Fair visitors saw the latest wonders in rail travel, automobiles, architecture and even cigarette-smoking robots. The exposition \"emphasized technology and progress, a utopia, or perfect world, founded on democracy and manufacturing.\"\nContext.\nA Century of Progress was organized as an Illinois nonprofit corporation in January 1928 for the purpose of planning and hosting a World's Fair in Chicago in 1934. City officials designated three and a half miles of newly reclaimed land along the shore of Lake Michigan between 12th and 39th streets on the Near South Side for the fairgrounds. Held on a portion of Burnham Park, the $37,500,000 (equal to $ today) exposition was formally opened on May 27, 1933, by U.S. Postmaster General James Farley at a four-hour ceremony at Soldier Field. The fair's opening night began with a nod to the heavens. Lights were automatically activated when the rays of the star Arcturus were detected. The star was chosen as its light had started its journey at about the time of the previous Chicago world's fair\u2014the World's Columbian Exposition\u2014in 1893. The rays were focused on photoelectric cells in a series of astronomical observatories and then transformed into electrical energy which was transmitted to Chicago.\nExhibits.\nThe fair buildings were multi-colored, to create a \"Rainbow City\" as compared to the \"White City\" of Chicago's earlier World's Columbian Exposition. The buildings generally followed Moderne architecture in contrast to the neoclassical themes used at the 1893 fair. One famous feature of the fair were the performances of fan dancer Sally Rand. Hal Pearl then known as \"Chicago's Youngest Organist\" and later \"The King of the Organ\" was the official organist of the fair. Mary Ann McArdle and her sister Isabel (from the UK) performed Irish Dancing. Other popular exhibits were the various auto manufacturers, the Midway (filled with nightclubs such as the Old Morocco, where future stars Judy Garland, the Cook Family Singers, and the Andrews Sisters performed), and a recreation of important scenes from Chicago's history. The fair also contained exhibits that may seem shocking to modern audiences, including offensive portrayals of African Americans, a \"Midget City\" complete with \"sixty Lilliputians\", and an exhibition of incubators containing real babies.\nThe fair included an exhibit on the history of Chicago. In the planning stages, several African American groups from the city's newly growing population campaigned for Jean Baptiste Point du Sable to be honored at the fair. At the time, few Chicagoans had even heard of Point du Sable, and the fair's organizers presented the 1803 construction of Fort Dearborn as the city's historical beginning. The campaign was successful, and a replica of Point du Sable's cabin was presented as part of the \"background of the history of Chicago\". Also on display was the \"Lincoln Group\" of reconstructions of buildings associated with the biography of Abraham Lincoln, including his birth cabin, the Lincoln-Berry General Store, the Chicago Wigwam (in reduced scale), and the Rutledge Tavern which served as a restaurant.\nAdmiral Byrd's polar expedition ship the \"City of New York\" was visited by President Franklin D. Roosevelt when he came to the fair on October 2, 1933. The \"City\" was on show for the full length of the exhibition.\nOne of the highlights of the 1933 World's Fair was the arrival of the German airship \"Graf Zeppelin\" on October 26, 1933. After circling Lake Michigan near the exposition for two hours, Commander Hugo Eckener landed the 776-foot airship at the nearby Curtiss-Wright Airport in Glenview. It remained on the ground for twenty-five minutes (from 1 to 1:25\u00a0pm) then took off ahead of an approaching weather front, bound for Akron, Ohio.\nThe \"dream cars\" which American automobile manufacturers exhibited at the fair included Rollston bodywork on a Duesenberg chassis, and was called the \"Twenty Grand\" ultra-luxury sedan; Cadillac's introduction of its V-16 limousine; Nash's exhibit had a variation on the vertical (i.e., paternoster lift) parking garage\u2014all the cars were new Nashes; Lincoln presented its rear-engined \"concept car\" precursor to the Lincoln-Zephyr, which went on the market in 1936 with a front engine; Pierce-Arrow presented its modernistic Pierce Silver Arrow for which it used the byline \"Suddenly it's 1940!\" But it was Packard which won the best of show with the reintroduction of the Packard Twelve.\nAn enduring exhibit was the 1933 Homes of Tomorrow Exhibition that demonstrated modern home convenience and creative practical new building materials and techniques with twelve model homes sponsored by several corporations affiliated with home decor and construction.\nMarine artist Hilda Goldblatt Gorenstein painted twelve murals for the Navy's exhibit in the Federal Building for the fair. The frieze was composed of twelve murals depicting the influence of sea power on America, beginning with the settlement of Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607 when sea power first reached America and carrying through World War I. Another set of murals, painted for the Ohio State Exhibit by William Mark Young, was relocated afterwards to the Ohio Statehouse. Young also painted scenes of the exhibition buildings.\nThe first Major League Baseball All-Star Game was held at Comiskey Park (home of the Chicago White Sox) in conjunction with the fair.\nIn May 1934, the Union Pacific Railroad exhibited its first streamlined train, the M-10000, and the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad its famous \"Zephyr\" which, on May 26, made a record-breaking dawn-to-dusk run from Denver, Colorado, to Chicago in 13 hours and 5 minutes, called the \"Dawn-to-Dusk Dash\". To cap its record-breaking speed run, the \"Zephyr\" arrived dramatically on-stage at the fair's \"Wings of a Century\" transportation pageant. The two trains launched an era of industrial streamlining. Both trains later went into successful revenue service, the Union Pacific's as the \"City of Salina\", and the Burlington \"Zephyr\" as the first \"Pioneer Zephyr\". The \"Zephyr\" is now on exhibit at Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry.\nFrank Buck furnished a wild animal exhibit, Frank Buck's Jungle Camp. Over two million people visited Buck's reproduction of the camp he and his native assistants lived in while collecting animals in Asia. After the fair closed, Buck moved the camp to a compound he had created at Amityville, New York.\nArchitecture.\nPlanning for the design of the Exposition began over five years prior to Opening Day. According to an official resolution, decisions regarding the site layout and the architectural style of the exposition were relegated to an architectural commission, which was led by Paul Cret and Raymond Hood. Local architects on the committee included Edward Bennett, John Holabird, and Hubert Burnham. Frank Lloyd Wright was specifically left off the commission due to his inability to work well with others, but did go on to produce three conceptual schemes for the fair. Members of this committee ended up designing most of the large, thematic exhibition pavilions.\nFrom the beginning, the commission members shared a belief that the buildings should not reinterpret past architectural forms \u2013 as had been done at earlier fairs, such as Chicago's 1893 World's Columbian Exposition\u2014but should instead reflect new, modern ideas, as well as suggest future architectural developments. Because the fairgrounds was on new man-made land that was owned by the state and not the city, the land was initially free from Chicago's strict building codes, which allowed the architects to explore new materials and building techniques. This allowed the design and construction of a wide array of experimental buildings, that eventually included large general exhibition halls, such as the Hall of Science (Paul Cret) and the Federal Building (Bennet, Burnham, and Holabird); corporate pavilions, including the General Motors Building (Albert Kahn) and the Sears Pavilion (Nimmons, Carr, and Wright); futuristic model houses, most popular was the twelve-sided House of Tomorrow (George Frederick Keck); as well as progressive foreign pavilions, including the Italian Pavilion (Mario de Renzi and Adalberto Libera); and historic and ethnic entertainment venues, such as the Belgian Village (Burnham Brothers with Alfons De Rijdt), and the Streets of Paris (Andrew Rebori and John W. Root) where fan dancer Sally Rand performed. These buildings were constructed out of five-ply Douglas fir plywood, ribbed-metal siding, and prefabricated boards such as Masonite, Sheetrock, Maizewood, as well as other new man-made materials. The exhibited buildings were windowless (but cheerfully lighted) buildings. Structural advances also filled the fairgrounds. These included the earliest catenary roof constructed in the United States, which roofed the dome of the Travel and Transport Building (Bennet, Burnham and Holabird) and the first thin shell concrete roof in the United States, on the small, multi-vaulted Brook Hill Farm Dairy built for the 1934 season of the fair.\nLater history.\nAmoebic dysentery outbreak.\nFrom June to November 1933, there was an outbreak of amoebic dysentery associated with the fair. There were more than a thousand cases, resulting in 98 deaths. Joel Connolly of the Chicago Bureau of Sanitary Engineering brought the outbreak to an end when he found that defective plumbing permitted sewage to contaminate drinking water in two hotels.\nExtension.\nOriginally, the fair was scheduled only to run until November 12, 1933, but it was so successful that it was opened again to run from May 26 to October 31, 1934. The fair was financed through the sale of memberships, which allowed purchases of a certain number of admissions once the park was open. More than $800,000 (equal to $ today) was raised in this manner as the country was in the Great Depression. A $10\u00a0million bond was issued on October 28, 1929, the day before the stock market crashed. By the time the fair closed in 1933, half of these notes had been retired, with the entire debt paid by the time the fair closed in 1934. For the first time in American history, an international fair had paid for itself. In its two years, it had attracted 48,769,227 visitors. According to James Truslow Adams's \"Dictionary of American History\", during the 170 days beginning May 27, 1933, there were 22,565,859 paid admissions; during the 163 days beginning May 26, 1934, there were 16,486,377; a total of 39,052,236.\nLegacy.\nMuch of the fair site is now home to Northerly Island park (since the closing of Meigs Field) and McCormick Place. The Balbo Monument, given to Chicago by Benito Mussolini to honor General Italo Balbo's 1933 trans-Atlantic flight, still stands near Soldier Field. The city added a third red star to its flag in 1933 to commemorate the Century of Progress Exposition (the Fair is now represented by the fourth of four stars on the flag). In conjunction with the fair, Chicago's Italian-American community raised funds and donated a statue of Genoese navigator and explorer Christopher Columbus. It was placed at the south end of Grant Park, near the site of the fair.\nThe Polish Museum of America possesses the painting of \"Pulaski at Savannah\" by Stanis\u0142aw Kaczor-Batowski, which was exhibited at the Century of Progress fair and where it won first place. After the close of the fair, the painting went on display at The Art Institute of Chicago where it was unveiled by Eleanor Roosevelt on July 10, 1934. The painting was on display at the Art Institute until its purchase by the Polish Women's Alliance on the museum's behalf.\nThe U.S. Post Office Department issued a special fifty-cent Air Mail postage stamp, (Scott catalogue number C-18) to commemorate the visit of the German airship depicting the fair's Federal Building, the \"Graf Zeppelin\" in flight, and its home hangar in Friedrichshafen, Germany. This stamp is informally known as the \"Baby Zep\" to distinguish it from the much more valuable 1930 Graf Zeppelin stamps (C13\u201315). Separate from this issue, for the Fair the Post Office also printed 1 and 3 cent commemorative postage stamps, showing respectively Fort Dearborn and the modernistic Federal Building. These were also printed in separate souvenir sheets as blocks of 25 (catalog listings 728\u201331). In 1935 the sheets were reprinted (Scott 766\u201367).\nFrom October 2010 through September 2011, the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C. opened an exhibition titled \"Designing Tomorrow: America's World's Fairs of the 1930s\". This exhibition prominently featured the Century of Progress fair in Chicago.\nResources.\nThe major archive for the Century of Progress International Exposition, including the official records from the event and the papers of Lenox Lohr, general manager of the fair, are housed in Special Collections at the University of Illinois, Chicago. A collection of materials including images is held by the Ryerson &amp; Burnham Libraries at the Art Institute of Chicago. The Century of Progress Collection includes photographs, guidebooks, brochures, maps, architectural drawings, and souvenir items. Specific collections with material include the Chicago Architects Oral History Project; the Daniel H. Burnham Jr. and Hubert Burnham Papers; Edward H. Bennett Collection; Voorhees, Gmelin, and Walker photographs.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It received positive reviews and grossed $27 million worldwide.\nPlot.\nNew York jazz pianist Willie returns to his hometown of Knight's Ridge, Massachusetts for his 10-year high school reunion, staying with his widower father and younger brother.\nWillie reunites with three old friends: Mo is a successful family man, while Paul and Tommy, who own a snowplowing business, have relationship issues. Paul was recently dumped by his longtime girlfriend Jan because he refused her ultimatum of marriage. Believing that she is now seeing Victor the meat cutter, he vindictively blocks her driveway with snow every night. Tommy is cheating on his girlfriend Sharon with his married high school sweetheart Darian.\nWillie meets 13-year-old neighbor girl Marty, and they strike up a witty rapport. She presses him about his relationship: he has been with his girlfriend Tracy for a year but is unsure if he wants to marry her. He is considering taking a steady job as a salesman, but Mo urges him not to quit his music.\nPaul desperately proposes to Jan, but she turns him down. Sharon argues with Tommy about his infidelity and seeks advice from her girlfriends. The outspoken Gina advises her to break up with Tommy, but Sharon tries to salvage the relationship by planning a surprise birthday party.\nWhen the attractive Andera comes to town from Chicago, the guys compete for her attention. The next day, Gina lectures Willie and Tommy about men's unrealistic expectations of women set by supermodels and pornography. Willie feels jealous when he sees that Marty has a boyfriend.\nDarian shows up at Tommy's surprise party drunk and openly tries to seduce him, causing Sharon to leave, heartbroken. Tommy drives Darian home but refuses her advances, and unsuccessfully tries to patch things up with Sharon. Willie tells Mo about his feelings for Marty but is reminded how young she is and says that he just doesn't want to grow up.\nWillie again encounters Marty, who says she has broken up with her boyfriend because she is interested in him, asking him to wait five years until she is 18 and they can be together. Willie declines, saying that she will outgrow her feelings for him as she matures.\nPaul takes Andera out, trying to make Jan jealous.

Tommy breaks things off with Darian, but she states her intent to win him back at the reunion.\nAndera approaches Willie, turning down his flirtations but accompanying him to Paul's ice shanty, where they discuss their respective relationships. He misses the emotional rush of new love, but she feels truly happy with her boyfriend and returns to Chicago the next day. Tracy arrives from New York, and Willie's feelings for her are rekindled. Marty is downhearted by this, but Willie assures her that she will grow up to do amazing things.\nAt the reunion, Darian is confronted by a former classmate who she bullied; he tells her that she was beautiful, but \"mean as a snake\". Tommy skips the reunion to avoid Darian but encounters her husband Steve and his friends at a bar. Steve reveals he knows about the affair; a fight ensues, and Tommy is badly beaten. Learning of this, the guys rush to Steve's house to confront him. Steve calls his friends, but Willie pushes their car into a snowbank using Paul's snowplow.

He said in an interview, \"It was the worst winter ever in this small hometown. Snow plows were coming by, and I was just tired of writing these movies with people getting shot and killed. So I said, 'There is more action going on in my hometown with my friends dealing with the fact that they cannot deal with turning 30 or with commitment'\u2014all that became \"Beautiful Girls\".\"\nOriginally, James L. Brooks was interested in directing the film, according to actress Leslie Mann, who auditioned for a role but was not cast.\nTed Demme had the entire cast come to Minneapolis and live together for two to three weeks so that they could bond. Filming took place in the Twin Cities Metro Area communities of Edina, Marine-on-St. Croix and Stillwater, with Demme wanting to make sure that the setting was a character unto itself. He \"wanted to make it look like it's Anytown USA, primarily East Coast. And I also wanted it to feel like a real working-class town\". To this end, Demme drew inspiration from Michael Cimino's \"The Deer Hunter\" (1978). \"The first third of the film is really an amazing buddy movie with those five actors. You could tell they were best friends, but they all had stuff amongst them that was personal to each one of them\".\nPrincipal photography took place between February and May 1995.\nReception.\nBox office.\nThe film was released on February 9, 1996, in 752 theaters in the United States and Canada, grossing $2.7 million on its opening weekend. It went on to gross $10.5 million in the United States and Canada and $27 million worldwide.\nCritical response.\nThe film received fairly positive reviews and has a 77% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 48 reviews. The site's consensus reads: \"A warm, thoughtful dramedy about male insecurity, \"Beautiful Girls\" is buoyed by an excellent cast - particularly Natalie Portman in a stunning early role\". Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" wrote: \"What's nicest about the film is the way it treasures the good feelings people can have for one another.\" In \"The Washington Post\", Desson Howe praised Natalie Portman's performance: \"As a self-described 'old soul' who connects spiritually with Hutton (they're both existential searchers), she's the movie's most poignant and witty presence.\"\nHowever, Jack Mathews, in the \"Los Angeles Times\", wrote that the film was \"about as much fun as a neighborhood bar on a Tuesday night. Its crisis: not much happening.\" In her \"New York Times\" review Janet Maslin wrote that Natalie Portman got the film's \"archest dialogue\", and called her \"a budding knockout, and scene-stealingly good even in an overly showy role.\"\n\"October Road\".\nScott Rosenberg co-produced and co-wrote for the 2007-2008 TV series \"October Road\". The show is loosely based on what happened after \"Beautiful Girls\" came out and how his friends reacted to a movie about their lives. Both \"Beautiful Girls\" and \"October Road\" take place in the fictional Massachusetts town of Knight's Ridge, and have similar characters, jobs, plot lines.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He grew up in Rockville Centre, New York on Long Island and attended South Side Senior High School. He graduated from SUNY-Cortland in 1985. He was the nephew of film producer and director Jonathan Demme.\nCareer.\nDemme's media career may have begun with a radio show at WSUC-FM (SUNY-Cortland), a mix of comedy and talk radio with the usual sidekick, as well as some music and was widely listened to on and off campus. He began his career as a production assistant at MTV. He later became a producer in the On-Air Promotions Department, created the cable network's hip-hop show \"Yo! MTV Raps\" (with Peter Dougherty), and directed other projects for MTV, including the black-and-white rants starring then-unknown comedian Denis Leary.\nOver the course of his career, he established a group of actors that he chose to work with on more than one occasion. The most frequently used of these was Leary, whom he directed as a lead or star in Leary's stand-up specials \"No Cure for Cancer\" and \"Lock n' Load\", as well as the films \"Who's the Man?\", \"The Ref\", and \"Monument Ave.\" Leary produced the 2001 crime drama film \"Blow\", which starred Johnny Depp as George Jung and was directed by Demme.\nPersonal life.\nDemme was married to Amanda Scheer, with whom he had two children. Scheer later opened several popular Los Angeles bars, including Teddy's at the Roosevelt Hotel, named in honor of her late husband. He was a fan of the Green Bay Packers.\nDeath.\nOn January 13, 2002, while playing a celebrity basketball game, Demme collapsed and died of a heart attack which may have been related to cocaine later found in his system during an autopsy. Demme was cremated and his ashes were given to his family.\nTributes.\nMuch of one edition of the IFC program \"Dinner for Five\" was given over to a description of Demme's last night and fond reminiscences about his life, mostly by Denis Leary and the show's host Jon Favreau. This touched on Demme's being a fan of the Green Bay Packers and his fondness for playing practical jokes.\nAt the 2002 Golden Globe awards show, one week following Demme's death, Kevin Spacey wore a picture of Demme on his suit jacket. He was also in the 74th Academy Awards In Memoriam tribute that was also presented by Kevin Spacey.\n\"The Truth About Charlie\", his uncle Jonathan Demme's remake of \"Charade\", was dedicated in his memory.\nThe 2003 album \"Blackberry Belle\" by The Twilight Singers led by Greg Dulli, was written in tribute to Demme, Dulli's close friend. Dulli had been working on another project, titled \"Amber Headlights\" (which would later see the light of day in 2005), but abandoned those sessions due to Demme's death. The recordings which followed, fueled in part by the memory of Demme, resulted in \"Blackberry Belle\".\nThe 2002 film \"Punch-Drunk Love\", written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, is dedicated to Demme.\nFilmography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The project stalled for nearly a decade until 20th Century Fox revived it and cast Susan Sarandon as the lead. Natalie Portman became attached to star as the co-lead and left her role on Broadway's \"The Diary of Anne Frank\" to commit to the film. However, Portman, who was then 17, said she would not do the film if it required her to do a love scene with nudity. Sarandon, who had co-star approval, made Portman's casting a condition of her own participation. Alvin Sargent did a rewrite of the scene, enabling Portman's involvement.\nDirector Wayne Wang initially kept some of the book's darker elements in the film, such as a suggestion of domestic abuse. Test audiences reacted negatively to this version, so Wang and Sargent went with a version that softened the dynamics of Adele and Ann's relationship.\nThe film was primarily shot in Los Angeles locations, including Beverly Hills High School, the Beverly Hills Hotel, LAX Airport, and Westwood Village.\nRelease.\n\"Anywhere But Here\" was slated for a spring of 1999 release, but Fox deemed the film not ready for release until that September. Fox then set an October 22 release date, which ultimately changed to November 12.\nBox office.\nThe film opened at #5 at the North American box office and made $5.6 million USD in its opening weekend.\nCritical reception.\nThe film received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a score of 63% based on reviews from 89 critics. The website's consensus reads: \"The strong chemistry between Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman as a mother and daughter trying to make a fresh start in L.A. helps to elevate \"Anywhere But Here\" above its occasional forays into melodrama.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the a score of 59 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating .\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film three stars and noted \"The movie's interest is not in the plot, which is episodic and 'colorful,' but in the performances. Sarandon bravely makes Adele into a person who is borderline insufferable. Sarandon's role is trickier and more difficult, but Portman's will get the attention. In 'Anywhere But Here,' she gets yanked along by her out-of-control mother, and her best scenes are when she fights back, not emotionally, but with incisive observations.\"\nAccolades.\nGolden Globe Awards\nYoung Artist Awards\nHollywood Makeup Artist and Hair Stylist Guild Awards\nSoundtrack.\nA soundtrack to the film was released on November 2, 1999, ten days before the theatrical release.

It stars Alan Alda, Allen, Drew Barrymore, Lukas Haas, Goldie Hawn, Gaby Hoffmann, Natasha Lyonne, Edward Norton, Natalie Portman, Julia Roberts, Tim Roth, and David Ogden Stiers. Set in New York City, Venice, and Paris, it features singing by actors not usually known for musical roles. The film was a box-office bomb, but is among the more critically successful of Allen's films, with \"Chicago Sun-Times\" critic Roger Ebert even ranking it as one of Allen's best.\nThe emotions of an extended upper-class family in Manhattan are followed in song in New York City, Paris, and Venice. Many characters act, interact, and sing in each city. They include young lovers Holden and Skylar, Skylar's parents Bob and Steffi, Steffi's ex-husband Joe, Steffi and Joe's daughter Djuna \"DJ\", a lady Joe meets named Von, and recently released prison inmate Charles Ferry.\nPlot.\nSkylar and Holden are an upper-class Manhattan couple (\"Just You, Just Me\"). Holden enlists DJ, Skylar's younger sister, to help him choose an expensive diamond engagement ring (\"My Baby Just Cares for Me\"). Skylar wants a \"take-charge\" kind of guy (\"I'm a Dreamer, Aren't We All\"). Holden's romantic gesture, at DJ's urging, backfires when Skylar swallows the ring he slipped into her parfait, resulting in a trip to the ER (\"Makin' Whoopee\").\nBob and Steffi Dandridge, liberal Democratic lawyers (\"Looking at You\") who have a blended family from previous marriages, are aghast at having a Republican son, Scott, who wants criminals taken off the street and disapproves of Steffi's work rehabilitating felons. Steffi, who volunteers with the American Civil Liberties Union (\"He was an abused child who made one mistake.\"), brings to the engagement party one of her causes, Charles, who scares guests with accounts of prison stabbings. Initially alarmed by Charles's aggressive passes (\"If I Had You\"), Skylar eventually falls under his spell (\"I've never been kissed by a sociopath before.\"), breaking up with Holden.\nSteffi and Bob are friendly with Steffi's neurotic ex-husband Joe, who lives in Paris, and has just broken up with his latest drug-using nymphomaniac girlfriend (\"I'm through with Love\"). Steffi wants to fix Joe up with a more suitable woman, but Joe is still hung up on Steffi.\nOn vacation with her father Joe in Venice, Italy, DJ and her friend, whose mother is a psychologist, listen through a hole in the wall on the clientele's therapy sessions. Von, an art historian, relates to the therapist that she is discontented with her husband, longing for romance and discussing her fantasies. DJ suggests Joe \"run into\" Von jogging and then coaches Joe on how to woo her by faking interest in art, music, travel, African daisies, and a hastily bought Parisian garret, and by setting up \"coincidental\" meetings at a museum and a concert. Convinced she has met the man of her dreams (\"All My Life\"), the unsuspecting Von leaves her husband for Joe.\nDJ falls for a gondolier and plans to drop out of college to marry him until she meets her next \"flame\": a student at Columbia University (\"Cuddle up a Little Closer, Lovey Mine\"). She then falls for a rapper in New York, and finally falls in love with a dashing Parisian.\nCompetitive sisters Lane and Laura, DJ's half-sisters, both have crushes on a local lad, heir to the Vandermost millions, but 14-year-old Laura is heartbroken when Vandermost falls for Lane (\"I'm Through with Love\").\nGrandpa, an 88-year-old with dementia, occasionally wanders off, corralled by Freda the maid, who DJ jokingly claims was Hitler's maid at Berchtesgaden. (\"It's Bavarian pasta, it doesn't need any sauce; Italian pasta needs sauce. The Italians were weak!\") At foot fetishist Grandpa's funeral, the corpses at the chapel sing and dance to \"Enjoy Yourself (It's Later than You Think)\".\nSkylar encourages ex-con Charles to study law, but he has other plans, involving the unwitting Skylar in a grocery store robbery with his gang. Begging to be let out of the getaway car, Skylar successfully escapes and eventually reconciles at a Halloween Party with a forgiving Holden (\"Chiquita Banana\"). This time Skylar swallows the engagement ring Holden has slipped in a box of Cracker Jack.\nScott is diagnosed with a blockage in an artery that has restricted the flow of oxygen to his brain, but it successfully resolves. He immediately resigns from the Young Republicans Club and starts to espouse left-wing causes.\nHaving lived out all her fantasies with \"the man of her dreams\", Von no longer yearns for them; she leaves Joe to return to her husband.\nThe family goes to Paris for Christmas and attends a Groucho Marx-themed New Years party (\"Hooray for Captain Spaulding\"). When Bob comes down with a cold, Steffi reunites with Joe and they reminisce, acknowledging that although their marriage didn't work out (\"I'm Through With Love\"), they still have feelings for each other. Although Steffi loves Bob \"wholeheartedly\", she and Joe kiss while accepting the boundaries of their mutually supportive relationship. Steffi encourages Joe to find someone who will make him happy. The family dances to \"Everyone Says I love You\" as DJ falls for a dance partner in a Harpo Marx costume.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;*Alan Alda as Bob Dandridge\nMusic.\nThe film uses classic songs for each scene, in some cases with unexpected dance routines. \nMost of the performers sing in their own voices, with the exception of Drew Barrymore, who convinced Allen that her singing was too awful even for the \"realistic singing voice\" concept he was going for. Her voice was dubbed by Olivia Hayman. Allen asked Goldie Hawn, a gifted singer, to sing \"poorly\" in order to achieve the \"realistic\"\nsound he was going for.\nThe title song was written by Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby and was used as a recurring theme song in the Marx Brothers film \"Horse Feathers\" (1932). Allen is a well-known Groucho Marx fan. Marx's theme song from \"Animal Crackers\" (1930) \"Hooray for Captain Spaulding\" is featured, sung in French by a chorus of Groucho Marxes. The songs, film score, and subsequent album were recorded, mixed, and co-produced by Dick Hyman and Roy Yokelson.\nReception.\nBox office.\nOn its opening weekend, the film grossed $131,678 from three theaters, with an average of $43,892 per theater. It ended its run with $9.8 million.\nCritical response.\nThe film was well received. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 77% based on 44 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"A likable, infectious musical, Woody Allen's \"Everyone Says I Love You\" is sometimes uneven but always toe-tapping and fun.\" Janet Maslin wrote a strongly positive review in \"The New York Times\", describing the film as \"a delightful and witty compendium of [Allen's] favorite things.\" Among the film's strongest detractors was Jonathan Rosenbaum, who described it as \"creepy\" and claimed, \"in this characterless world of Manhattan-Venice-Paris, where love consists only of self-validation, and political convictions of any kind are attributable to either hypocrisy or a brain condition, the me-first nihilism of Allen's frightened worldview is finally given full exposure, and it's a grisly thing to behold.\"\nAccolades.\nThe film was nominated for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy at the 54th Golden Globe Awards.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
