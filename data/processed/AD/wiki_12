The service was established in 1791 and chain ferry operations were introduced by James Meadows Rendel in 1832.\nCurrent operations.\nThe route is currently served by three ferries, built by Ferguson Shipbuilders Ltd at Port Glasgow and named after three rivers in the area: \"Tamar II\", \"Lynher II\" and \"Plym II\". Each ferry carries 73 cars and operates using its own set of slipways and parallel chains, with a vehicle weight limit of . The ferry boats are propelled across the river by pulling themselves on the chains; the chains then sink to the bottom to allow shipping movements in the river. An intensive service is provided, with service frequencies ranging from every 10 minutes (three ferries in service) at peak times, to half-hourly (one ferry in service) at night. Services operate 24 hours a day, every day (including throughout Christmas and all other holiday periods), with service frequency never falling below half-hourly.\nThe ferries, along with the nearby Tamar Bridge, are operated by the Tamar Bridge and Torpoint Ferry Joint Committee, which is jointly owned by Plymouth City Council and Cornwall Council.\nTolls are payable in the Torpoint to Devonport eastbound direction only, except for motorcyclists, who pay westbound only. The toll is \u00a33 for cars and motorcycle riders are charged \u00a31; there is no additional charge for a pillion passenger. Frequent users can reduce the fare by half by purchasing top-ups online for a machine-readable windscreen-mounted digital payment tag, called TamarTag, which is also usable on the bridge. The toll increase of 50% in March 2010 was the first rise for nearly 15 years before a further increase in November 2019.\nThe ferry takes around 10 minutes as opposed to a 20-mile, 30-minute trip around the mainland; rush hour times differ.\nTechnical information.\nThe fully loaded weight of each ferry is given as 1,000 tonnes, powered by up to three 12-litre diesel engines with generators feeding the two electric motors each driving its chainwheel of nearly 2 m diameter. Normally one generator suffices; the extra two provide redundancy and extra power in bad weather or for extra speed. Each chain is 650 m long and weighs 23 t. There are eight guiding pulleys per chain and rubbing plates where the chains enter and leave the hull. The chains are replaced every three years.\nUnlike most chain ferries with the chain ends attached directly to the shores, the chains of the Torpoint ferries are attached with a system of falling weights and pulleys on each shore and for each ferry. This keeps a minimum tension of 3 tonnes force on each chain, but also a maximum tension of this amount, plus some friction, as long as the weights are free to fall and rise in their pits.\nHistory.\nA ferry route between Torpoint and Plymouth Dock (now called Devonport) was created by an act of Parliament, the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Plymouth Dock to Torpoint Ferry Act 1790 (30 Geo. 3. c. 61) and the Earl of Mount Edgcumbe began to run ferries the following year. In 1826 the ferry operations were taken over by the Torpoint Steamboat Company, which built landing piers on both sides of the Tamar. The company also built the steam ferry \"Jemima\" which entered service in 1831. The steamer was unable to hold a course in the strong tidal flow of the Hamoaze, so it was soon withdrawn and the older ferryboats returned to service.\nThe steamboat company approached James Meadows Rendel in 1832 and asked him to design a steam-powered floating bridge for the route. Two ferries were built in 1834 and 1835 and provided a continuous service, operating in alternate months. The tolls varied between 2d for a horse and 5s for a coach with four horses, with a double fare charged on Sundays.\nThe original ferries were replaced by two new ferries built in 1871 and 1878. As a result of increasing traffic, the ferry company investigated twin ferry operations in 1905. Both the Admiralty and Devonport Corporation opposed this as the company would need to expand the landing beach in Devonport. An experimental two ferry service with the existing shore installations had to be abandoned due to the strain on the equipment. A supplementary steamer service was also introduced in 1902, with the \"Volta\" and \"Lady Beatrice\" linking Torpoint to two locations in Devonport on a triangular route.\nCornwall County Council acquired both the ferry and the steamers in 1922 for \u00a342,000. The \"Volta\" was immediately sold for breaking and two new ferries were ordered, which entered service in 1925 and 1926. These were the first ferries on the route designed to carry motor vehicles and could carry 800 passengers and 16 cars. Land was acquired on both sides of the rivers to lay a second set of chains and expand the landing beaches. A third, reserve, ferry was ordered and modern shore facilities were also built and twin-ferry operation began in July 1932. These changes made the supplementary steamer redundant and the \"Lady Beatrice\" was sold.\nIn July 1923 it was reported that an Asian elephant, named Julia, a part of the Bostock and Wombwell Menagerie, had swum across the river after she had broken loose and \"launched herself from the ferry\". She was encouraged to swim by her trainer who finally managed to loop a chain around her neck and she arrived safely at the other side.\nMotor traffic using the route increased rapidly after World War II, and two new ferries with a capacity of 30 cars each were introduced by 1961. A third ferry entered service in 1966 and a marshalling area was built on the Torpoint foreshore, relieving congestion in the centre of Torpoint. The landing beaches were expanded further in 1972, allowing all three ferries to operate simultaneously. The three ferries were refitted in the 1980s and were stretched so that they could carry approximately 50 cars.\nAfter the refit, they were named the \"Tamar\", \"Lynher\" and \"Plym\". These remained in service until 2005 when they were replaced by the current ferries.\nAll three ferries, \"Lynher\", \"Plym\" and \"Tamar\", were sold in 2004 for recycling by the company Smedegaarden located at Esbjerg in Denmark. They had the vessels towed across the North Sea and recycled in 2005.\nIn April 2022, a campaign pressure group known as the Tamar Toll Action Group was formed. Their stated goal is to seek an end to tolls on both Tamar crossings.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31178", "revid": "49836368", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31178", "title": "Tarot", "text": "Cards used for games or divination\nTarot (, first known as \"trionfi\" and later as tarocchi or tarocks) is a set of playing cards used in tarot games and in fortune-telling or divination. From at least the mid-15th century, the tarot was used to play trick-taking card games such as Tarocchini. From their Italian roots, tarot games spread to most of Europe, evolving into new forms including German Grosstarok and modern examples such as French Tarot and Austrian K\u00f6nigrufen. \nTarot is commonly found in many countries, especially in English and Spanish speaking countries where tarot games are not as widely played, in the form of specially designed cartomantic decks used primarily for tarot card reading, in which each card corresponds to an assigned archetype or interpretation for divination, fortune-telling or for other non-gaming uses.\nThe emergence of custom decks for use in divination via tarot card reading and cartomancy began after French occultists made elaborate, but unsubstantiated, claims about their history and meaning in the late 18th century. Thus, there are two distinct types of tarot packs in circulation: those used for card games and those used for divination. However, some older patterns, such as the Tarot de Marseille and the Swiss 1JJ Tarot, originally intended for playing card games, are also used for cartomancy. \nTarot has four suits that vary by region: French suits are used in western, central and eastern Europe, and Latin suits in southern Europe. Each suit has 14 cards: ten pip cards numbering from one (or Ace) to ten; and four face cards: King, Queen, Knight, and Jack/Knave/Page. In addition, the tarot also has a separate 21-card trump suit and a single card known as the Fool. Depending on the game, the Fool may act as the top trump or may be played to avoid following suit. These tarot cards are still used throughout much of Europe to play trick-taking card games.\nDistribution.\nThe use of tarot for trick-taking games was at one time widespread across the whole of Europe except the British Isles, the Iberian Peninsula, and the Balkans. Having fallen into decline by the 20th century, the games later experienced a renaissance in some countries and regions. For example, French Tarot was largely confined to Provence in the 18th century, but took off in the 1950s to such an extent that, in 1973, the French Tarot Association (\"F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise de Tarot\") was formed and French Tarot itself is now the second most popular card game in France. Tarock games like K\u00f6nigrufen have experienced significant growth in Austria where international tournaments are held with other nations, especially those from eastern Europe that still play such games, including Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. \nDenmark appears to be the only Scandinavian country that still plays tarot games, Danish Tarok being a derivative of historical German Grosstarock. The game of Cego has grown in popularity again in the south German region of Baden. Italy continues to play regionally popular games with their distinctive Tarot packs. These include: Ottocento in Bologna and Sicilian Tarocchi in parts of Sicily. Meanwhile Troccas and Troggu are still played locally in parts of Switzerland.\nHistory.\nPlaying cards and early tarot-like games.\nTarot cards, then known as \"tarocchi\" (Italian), first appeared in Ferrara and Milan in northern Italy, with the Fool and 21 trumps (then called \"trionfi\") being added to the standard Italian pack of four suits: batons, coins, cups and swords. Scholarship has established that early European playing cards were probably based on the Egyptian Mamluk deck invented in or before the 14th century, which followed the introduction of paper from Asia into Western Europe. By the late 1300s, Europeans were producing their own cards, the earliest patterns being based on the Mamluk deck but with variations to the suit symbols and court cards.\nThe first records of playing cards in Europe date to 1367 in Bern and they appear to have spread very rapidly across the whole of Europe, as may be seen from the records, mainly of card games being banned. Little is known about the appearance and number of these cards, the only significant information being provided by a text by John of Rheinfelden in 1377 from Freiburg im Breisgau, who, in addition to other versions, describes the basic pack as containing the still-current 4 suits of 13 cards, the courts usually being the King, Ober and Unter (\"marshals\"), although Dames and Queens were already known by then.\nAn early pattern of playing cards used the suits of batons or clubs, coins, swords, and cups. These suits are still used in traditional Italian, Spanish and Portuguese playing card decks, and are also used in modern (occult) tarot divination cards that first appeared in the late 18th century.\nA lost tarot-like pack was commissioned by Duke Filippo Maria Visconti and described by Martiano da Tortona, probably between 1418 and 1425 since the painter he mentions, Michelino da Besozzo, returned to Milan in 1418, while Martiano himself died in 1425. He described a 60-card deck with 16 cards having images of the Roman gods and suits depicting four kinds of birds. The 16 cards were regarded as \"trumps\" since, in 1449, Jacopo Antonio Marcello recalled that the now deceased duke had invented a \"novum quoddam et exquisitum triumphorum genus\", or \"a new and exquisite kind of triumphs.\" Other early decks that also showcased classical motifs include the Sola-Busca and Boiardo-Viti decks of the 1490s.\nEarly tarot decks.\nThe first documented tarot decks were recorded between 1440 and 1450 in Milan, Ferrara, Florence and Bologna, when additional trump cards with allegorical illustrations were added to the common four-suit pack. These new decks were called \"carte da trionfi\", triumph cards, and the additional cards known simply as trionfi, which became \"trumps\" in English. The earliest documentation of \"trionfi\" is found in a written statement in the court records of Florence, in 1440, regarding the transfer of two decks to Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta.\nThe oldest surviving tarot cards are the 15 or so decks of the Visconti-Sforza Tarot painted in the mid-15th century for the rulers of the Duchy of Milan. In 15th century Italy, the set of cards that was included in tarot packs, including trumps, seems to have been consistent, even if naming and ordering varied. There are two main exceptions:\nAlthough a Dominican preacher inveighed against the evil inherent in playing cards, chiefly because of their use in gambling, in a sermon in the 15th century, no routine condemnations of tarot were found during its early history.\nPropagation.\nBecause the earliest tarot cards were hand-painted, the number of the decks produced is thought to have been small. It was only after the invention of the printing press that mass production of cards became possible. The expansion of tarot outside of Italy, first to France and Switzerland, occurred during the Italian Wars. The most prominent tarot deck version used in these two countries was the Tarot of Marseilles, of Milanese origin.\nWhile the set of trumps was generally consistent, their order varied by region, perhaps as early as the 1440s. Michael Dummett placed them into three categories. In Bologna and Florence, the highest trump is the Angel, followed by the World. This group spread mainly southward through the Papal States, the Kingdom of Naples, and finally down to the Kingdom of Sicily but was also known in the Savoyard states. In Ferrara, the World was the highest, followed by Justice and the Angel. This group spread mainly to the northeast to Venice and Trento where it was only a passing fad. By the end of the 16th century, this order became extinct. In Milan, the World was highest, followed by the Angel; this ordering is used in the Tarot of Marseilles. Dummett also wrote about a possible fourth lineage that may have existed along the Franco-Italian border. It spread north through France until its last descendant, the Belgian Tarot, went extinct around 1800.\nIn Florence, an expanded deck called \"Minchiate\" was later used. This deck of 97 cards includes astrological symbols and the four elements, as well as traditional tarot motifs. The earliest known mention of this game, under the name of \"germini\", dates to 1506.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"tarot\" and German \"Tarock\" derive from the Italian \"Tarocchi\", the origin of which is uncertain, although \"taroch\" was used as a synonym for foolishness in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. The decks were known exclusively as \"Trionfi\" during the fifteenth century. The new name first appeared in Brescia around 1502 as \"Tarocho\". During the 16th century, a new game played with a standard deck but sharing a very similar name (Trionfa) was quickly becoming popular. This coincided with the older game being renamed \"tarocchi\". In modern Italian, the singular term is \"Tarocco\", which, as a noun, is a cultivar of blood orange. The attribute \"Tarocco\" and the verb \"Taroccare\" are used regionally to indicate that something is fake or forged. This meaning is directly derived from the tarocchi game as played in Italy, in which \"tarocco\" indicates a card that can be played in place of another card.\nPlaying card decks.\nThe original purpose of tarot cards was to play games. A very cursory explanation of rules for a tarot-like deck is given in a manuscript by Martiano da Tortona before 1425. Vague descriptions of game play or game terminology follow for the next two centuries until the earliest known complete description of rules for a French variant in 1637. The game of tarot has many regional variations. Tarocchini has survived in Bologna and there are still others played in Piedmont and Sicily, but in Italy the game is generally less popular than elsewhere.\nThe 18th century saw tarot's greatest revival, during which it became one of the most popular card games in Europe, played everywhere except Ireland and Britain, the Iberian peninsula, and the Ottoman Balkans. French tarot experienced another revival, beginning in the 1970s, and France has the strongest tarot gaming community. Regional tarot games\u2014often known as \"tarock\", \"tarok\", or \"tarokk\"\u2014are widely played in central Europe within the borders of the former Austro-Hungarian empire.\nItalian-suited decks.\nItalian-suited decks were first devised in the 15th century in northern Italy. Three decks of this category are still used to play certain games:\nItalo-Portuguese-suited deck.\nThe Tarocco Siciliano is the only deck to use the so-called Portuguese suit system, which uses Spanish pips but intersects them like Italian pips. Some of the trumps are different such as the lowest trump, \"Miseria\" (destitution). It omits the Two and Three of coins, and numerals one to four in clubs, swords and cups: it thus has 64 cards, but the ace of coins is not used, being the bearer of the former stamp tax. The cards are quite small and not reversible.[9]\nSpanish-suited deck.\nThe sole surviving example of a Spanish-suited deck was produced around 1820 by Giacomo Recchi of Oneglia, Liguria and destined for Sardinia. The plain suit cards are copied from the Sardinian pattern designed just ten years earlier by Jos\u00e9 Martinez de Castro for Clemente Roxas in Madrid but with the addition of 10s and queens. The trumps are largely copied from an early version of the Tarocco Piemontese. At that time, Liguria, Sardinia, and Piedmont were all territories of the Savoyard state.\nFrench-suited decks.\nFrench suited tarot cards use the suit signs of clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades. With the exception of novelty decks, French-suited tarot cards are almost exclusively used for card games.\nThe earliest French-suited tarot decks were made by the de Poilly family of engravers, beginning with a Minchiate deck by Fran\u00e7ois de Poilly in the late 1650s. Aside from these early outliers, the first generation of French-suited tarots depicted scenes of animals on the trumps and were thus called \"Tiertarock\" (\"Tier\" being German for \"animal\") and first appeared around 1740. Around 1800, a greater variety of decks were produced, mostly with genre art or veduta. The German states used to produce a variety of 78-card tarot packs using Italian suits, but later switching to French suited cards; some were imported to France. There remain only two French-suited patterns of Cego packs - the Cego Adler pack manufactured by ASS Altenburger and one with genre scenes by F.X. Schmid, which may reflect the mainstream German cards of the 19th century. Current French-suited tarot decks come in these patterns:\nGerman-suited Tarock cards.\nFrom the late 18th century, in addition to producing their own true Tarot packs, the south German states manufactured German-suited packs labeled \"Taroc\", \"Tarock\" or \"Deutsch-Tarok\". These survive as \"Schafkopf/Tarock\" packs of the Bavarian and Franconian pattern. These are not true tarot packs, but standard 36-card German-suited decks for games like German Tarok, Bauerntarock, W\u00fcrttemberg Tarock and Bavarian Tarock. Until the 1980s there were also Tarock packs in the W\u00fcrttemberg pattern. There are 36 cards; the pip cards ranging from 6 to 10, Under Knave (\"Unter\"), Over Knave (\"Ober\"), King, and Ace. These use ace\u2013ten ranking, like klaverjas, where ace is the highest followed by 10, king, Ober, Unter, then 9 to 6. The heart suit is the default trump suit. The Bavarian pack is also used to play Schafkopf by excluding the Sixes.\nCartomancy.\nIn countries where tarot trick taking games are not widely played, such as English speaking countries, only specially designed cartomantic tarot cards, used primarily for novelty and divination, are readily available. The early French occultists claimed that tarot cards had esoteric links to ancient Egypt, Kabbalah, the Indic Tantra, or I Ching, claims that have been frequently repeated by authors on card divination. However, scholarly research has demonstrated that tarot cards were invented in northern Italy in the mid-15th century and confirmed that there is no historical evidence of any significant use of tarot cards for divination until the late 18th century. The tarot's esoteric ties and obscured origins proposed in theories by freemasons and occultists during this period led to the implied authority of the deck and its users. Historians such as Michael Dummett have described the Tarot pack as \"the subject of the most successful propaganda campaign ever launched [...] An entire false history and false interpretation of the Tarot pack was concocted by the occultists and it is all but universally believed.\"\nThe earliest evidence of a tarot deck used for cartomancy comes from an anonymous manuscript from around 1750 which documents rudimentary divinatory meanings for the cards of the Tarocco Bolognese. The popularization of esoteric tarot started with Antoine Court and Jean-Baptiste Alliette (Etteilla) in Paris during the 1780s, using the Tarot of Marseilles. French tarot players abandoned the Marseilles tarot in favor of the Tarot Nouveau around 1900, with the result that the Marseilles pattern is now used mostly by cartomancers.\nEtteilla was the first to produce a bespoke tarot deck specifically designed for occult purposes around 1789. In keeping with the unsubstantiated belief that such cards were derived from the Book of Thoth, Etteilla's tarot contained themes related to ancient Egypt.\nIn the occult tradition, tarot cards are referred to as \"arcana\", with the Fool and 21 trumps being termed the Major Arcana and the suit cards the Minor Arcana, terms not used by players of tarot card games.\nThe 78-card tarot deck used by esotericists has two distinct parts:\nThe terms \"Major Arcana\" and \"Minor Arcana\" were first used by Jean-Baptiste Pitois (also known as Paul Christian), but are never used in relation to tarot card games. Some decks exist primarily as artwork, and such art decks sometimes contain only the 22 Major Arcana.\nThe three most common decks used in esoteric tarot are the Tarot of Marseilles (a playing card pack), the Rider\u2013Waite Tarot, and the Thoth Tarot.\nAleister Crowley, who devised the Thoth deck along with Lady Frieda Harris, stated of the tarot: \"The origin of this pack of cards is very obscure. Some authorities seek to put it back as far as the ancient Egyptian Mysteries; others try to bring it forward as late as the fifteenth or even the sixteenth century ... [but] The only theory of ultimate interest about the tarot is that it is an admirable symbolic picture of the Universe, based on the data of the Holy Qabalah.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Although he came from a peasant background, his immense power earned him the rank and title of and , the highest official position and title in the nobility class. He was the first person in history to become a \"Kampaku\" who was not born a noble. He then passed the position and title of \"Kampaku\" to his nephew, Toyotomi Hidetsugu. He remained in power as , the title of retired \"Kampaku\", until his death. It is believed, but not certain, that the reason he refused or could not obtain the title of , the leader of the warrior class, was because he was of peasant origin.\nHideyoshi rose from a peasant background as a retainer of the prominent lord Oda Nobunaga to become one of the most powerful men in Japanese history. He distinguished himself in many of Nobunaga's campaigns. After Nobunaga's death in the Honn\u014d-ji Incident in 1582, Hideyoshi defeated his assassin Akechi Mitsuhide at the Battle of Yamazaki and became Nobunaga's successor. He then continued the campaign to unite Japan that led to the closing of the Sengoku period. Hideyoshi became the \"de facto\" leader of Japan and acquired the prestigious positions of \"daij\u014d-daijin\" and \"kampaku\" by the mid-1580s. He conquered Shikoku in 1585 and Ky\u016bsh\u016b in 1587, and completed the unification by winning the Siege of Odawara in 1590 and crushing the Kunohe rebellion in 1591. With the unification of Japan complete, Hideyoshi launched the Japanese invasions of Korea in 1592 to initial success, but eventual military stalemate damaged his prestige before his death in 1598. Hideyoshi's young son and successor Toyotomi Hideyori was displaced by Tokugawa Ieyasu at the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600 which would lead to the founding of the Tokugawa Shogunate.\nHideyoshi's rule covers most of the Azuchi\u2013Momoyama period of Japan, partially named after his castle, Momoyama Castle. Hideyoshi left an influential and lasting legacy in Japan, including Osaka Castle, the Tokugawa class system, the restriction on the possession of weapons to the samurai (the sword hunt), and the construction and restoration of many temples, some of which are still visible in Kyoto.\nEarly life (1537\u20131558).\nAccording to tradition, Hideyoshi was born on February 16, 1537, according to the lunar Japanese calendar (March 17, 1537, according to the Julian calendar; March 27, 1537 (Proleptic Gregorian calendar)) in Nakamura, Owari Province (present-day Nakamura Ward, Nagoya), in the middle of the chaotic Sengoku period under the collapsed Ashikaga Shogunate. Hideyoshi had no traceable samurai lineage, and his father Kinoshita Yaemon was an \"ashigaru\" \u2013 a peasant employed by the samurai as a foot soldier. Hideyoshi had no surname, and his childhood given name was although variations exist. Yaemon died in 1543 when Hideyoshi was seven years old.\nContemporary writings from Ankokuji Ekei and Kakukane Ue, a retainer of the Shimazu clan, confirm Hideyoshi's poor background, with Ekei noting that Hideyoshi even had to beg on the street.\nMany legends describe Hideyoshi being sent to study at a temple as a young man, but he rejected temple life and went in search of adventure. Under the name , he first joined the Imagawa clan as a servant to a local ruler named Matsushita Yukitsuna .\nService under Nobunaga (1558\u20131582).\nIn 1558, Hideyoshi became an \"ashigaru\" for the powerful Oda clan, the rulers of his home province of Owari, now headed by the ambitious Oda Nobunaga.\nHideyoshi soon became Nobunaga's sandal-bearer, a position of relatively high status. According to his biographers, Hideyoshi also supervised the repair of Kiyosu Castle, a claim described as \"apocryphal\", and managed the kitchen.\nIn 1561, Hideyoshi married One, the adopted daughter of Asano Nagakatsu, a descendant of Minamoto no Yorimitsu. Hideyoshi carried out repairs on Sunomata Castle with his younger half-brother, Hashiba Koichir\u014d, along with Hachisuka Masakatsu, and Maeno Nagayasu. Hideyoshi's efforts were well-received because Sunomata was in enemy territory, and according to legend Hideyoshi constructed a fort in Sunomata overnight and discovered a secret route into Mount Inaba, after which much of the local garrison surrendered.\nIn 1564, Hideyoshi found success as a negotiator. He managed to convince a number of Mino warlords to desert the Sait\u014d clan, mostly with liberal bribes. This included the Sait\u014d clan's strategist, Takenaka Shigeharu.\nNobunaga's easy victory at the siege of Inabayama Castle in 1567 was largely due to Hideyoshi's efforts, and despite his peasant origins. In 1568, Hideyoshi became one of Nobunaga's most distinguished generals, eventually taking the name . The new surname included two characters, one each from Oda's right-hand men and , and the new given name included characters from and .\nIn 1570, Hideyoshi protected Nobunaga's retreat from Azai-Asakura forces at Kanegasaki. Later, in June 1570, Nobunaga allied with Tokugawa Ieyasu at the Battle of Anegawa to lay siege to two fortresses of the Azai and Asakura clans, and Hideyoshi was assigned to lead Oda troops into open battle for the first time.\nIn 1573, after victorious campaigns against the Azai and Asakura, Nobunaga appointed Hideyoshi \"daimy\u014d\" of three districts in the northern part of \u014cmi Province. Initially, Hideyoshi stayed at the former Azai headquarters at Odani Castle, but moved to Kunitomo town and renamed it \"Nagahama\" in tribute to Nobunaga. Hideyoshi later moved to the port at Imahama on Lake Biwa, where he began work on Imahama Castle and took control of the nearby Kunitomo firearms factory that had been established some years previously by the Azai and Asakura. Under Hideyoshi's administration, the factory's output of firearms increased dramatically. Later, Hideyoshi participated in the 1573 siege of Nagashima.\nIn 1574, Hideyoshi and Araki Murashige captured Itami Castle, and later in 1575, he fought in the Battle of Nagashino against the Takeda clan.\nIn 1576, he took part in the Siege of Mitsuji, part of the eleven-year Ishiyama Hongan-ji War. Later, Nobunaga sent Hideyoshi to Himeji Castle to conquer the Ch\u016bgoku region from the Mori clan. Hideyoshi then fought in the Battle of Tedorigawa (1577), the siege of Miki (1578), the siege of Tottori (1581) and the siege of Takamatsu (1582).\nDeath of Nobunaga.\nOn June 21, 1582, during the Siege of Takamatsu, Oda Nobunaga and his eldest son and heir Nobutada were both killed in the Honn\u014d-ji incident. Their assassination ended Nobunaga's quest to consolidate centralised power in Japan under his authority. Hideyoshi, seeking vengeance for the death of his lord, made peace with the M\u014dri clan and thirteen days later met Akechi Mitsuhide and defeated him at the Battle of Yamazaki, avenging Nobunaga and taking his authority and power for himself.\nMeanwhile, the H\u014dj\u014d clan and the Uesugi clan invaded Kai and Shinano province when they heard of Nobunaga's death, beginning the Tensh\u014d-Jingo war. When the Oda clan learned of the defeat of Takigawa Kazumasu at the Battle of Kanagawa by the H\u014dj\u014d clan, Hideyoshi sent a letter to Ieyasu on July 7 giving him authorization to lead military operations to secure the two provinces from the H\u014dj\u014d and Uesugi clans. As the war turned in Ieyasu's favor and Sanada Masayuki defected to the Tokugawa side, the H\u014dj\u014d clan negotiated a truce. H\u014dj\u014d Ujinobu and Ii Naomasa were the H\u014dj\u014d and Tokugawa representatives for the preliminary meetings. Representatives from the Oda clan such as Oda Nobukatsu, Oda Nobutaka, and Hideyoshi himself mediated the negotiation until the truce officially took effect in October with both Ieyasu and H\u014dj\u014d Ujinao exchanging family members as hostages as a sign of goodwill.\nRise to power (1582\u20131585).\nIn 1582, Hideyoshi began construction of Osaka Castle. Built on the site of the temple Ishiyama Hongan-ji, which was destroyed by Nobunaga, construction was completed in 1597. The castle would become the last stronghold of the Toyotomi clan after Hideyoshi's death.\nConflict with Katsuie.\nIn late 1582, Hideyoshi was in a very strong position. He summoned the powerful \"daimy\u014d\" to Kiyosu Castle so that they could determine Nobunaga's heir. Oda Nobukatsu and Oda Nobutaka quarreled, causing Hideyoshi to instead choose Nobunaga's infant grandson Oda Hidenobu.\nShibata Katsuie initially supported Hideyoshi's decision, but later supported Nobunaga's third son Nobutaka, for whom Katsuie had performed the genpuku ritual. He allied with Nobutaka and Takigawa Kazumasu against Hideyoshi. Tension quickly escalated between Hideyoshi and Katsuie, and at the Battle of Shizugatake in the following year, Hideyoshi destroyed Katsuie's forces. Hideyoshi had thus consolidated his own power, dealt with most of the Oda clan, and now controlled some 30 provinces.\nConflict with Ieyasu.\nIn 1584, Nobukatsu allied himself with Tokugawa Ieyasu, and the two sides fought at the inconclusive Battle of Komaki and Nagakute. This ultimately resulted in a stalemate, although Hideyoshi's forces were delivered a heavy blow. Ieyasu and Hideyoshi never fought against each other in person, but the former managed to check the advance of the latter's allies. After Hideyoshi and Ieyasu heard the news of Ikeda Tsuneoki and Mori Nagayoshi's deaths, both withdrew their troops.\nFollowing this, Ieyasu's general Sakakibara Yasumasa circulated a derogatory manifesto condemning Hideyoshi's conduct as betrayal towards the will of Oda Nobunaga and also insulting Hideyoshi's origins. This infuriated Hideyoshi, who offered a reward of 100,000 \"Kan\" (Japanese gold ingot) to anyone who could bring him Yasumasa's head.\nLater, Hideyoshi made peace with Nobukatsu and Ieyasu, ending the pretext for war between the Tokugawa and Hashiba clans. However, Ieyasu continued to refuse to become Hideyoshi's vassal. Hideyoshi had begun to move towards attacking Ieyasu, but the 1586 Tensh\u014d earthquake caused extensive damage to Osaka, causing Hideyoshi to abandon the campaign against Ieyasu. Hideyoshi sent his younger sister Asahi no kata and mother \u014cmandokoro to Tokugawa Ieyasu as hostages. In response, Ieyasu finally traveled to Osaka and expressed his intention to submit to Hideyoshi.\nToyotomi clan and Imperial Court appointment.\nLike Oda Nobunaga before him, Hideyoshi never achieved the title of \"sh\u014dgun\". Instead, he arranged to have himself adopted by Konoe Sakihisa, one of the noblest men belonging to the Fujiwara clan, and secured a succession of high court titles. These included Chancellor (Daij\u014d-daijin), and in 1585, the prestigious position of Imperial Regent (kampaku). Also in 1585, Hideyoshi was formally given the new clan name Toyotomi (instead of Fujiwara) by the Imperial Court. He built a lavish palace in 1587, the Jurakudai, and entertained the reigning Emperor Go-Y\u014dzei the following year.\nUnification of Japan (1585\u20131592).\nAlso in 1585, Hideyoshi launched the siege of Negoro-ji and subjugated Kii Province. The Negoro-gumi, the warrior monks of Negoro-ji, were allied with the Ikk\u014d-ikki and with Tokugawa Ieyasu, whom they supported in the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute the previous year. After attacking a number of other outposts in the area, Hideyoshi's forces attacked Negoro-ji from two sides. Many of the Negoro-gumi had already fled to \u014cta Castle by this time, which Hideyoshi later besieged. The complex was set aflame, beginning with the residences of the priests, and Hideyoshi's samurai cut down monks as they escaped the blazing buildings.\nIn the 1585 Invasion of Shikoku, Toyotomi forces seized Shikoku island, the smallest of Japan's four main islands, from Ch\u014dsokabe Motochika. Toyotomi's forces arrived 113,000 strong under Toyotomi Hidenaga, Toyotomi Hidetsugu, Ukita Hideie and the M\u014dri clan's \"Two Rivers\", Kobayakawa Takakage and Kikkawa Motoharu. Opposing them were 40,000 men of Ch\u014dsokabe's. Despite the overwhelming size of Hideyoshi's army, and the suggestions of his advisors, Motochika chose to fight to defend his territories.\nDuring the late summer of August 1585, Hideyoshi launched an attack on Etch\u016b Province and Hida Province where he besieged Toyama Castle.\n1586-1588 activities.\nIn 1586 Hideyoshi conquered Ky\u016bsh\u016b, wresting control from the Shimazu clan. Toyotomi Hidenaga, Hideyoshi's half-brother, landed to the south of Bungo province on Ky\u016bsh\u016b's eastern coast. Meanwhile, Hideyoshi took his own forces down a more western route, in Chikuzen province. Later that year, with a total of 200,000 soldiers against the 30,000 men of the Shimazu forces, the two brothers met in Satsuma province. They besieged Kagoshima castle, the Shimazu clan's home. The Shimazu surrendered.\nIn 1588, Hideyoshi implemented Sword hunt, where he forbade ordinary peasants from owning weapons and started a sword hunt to confiscate all weapons owned by peasants. The weapons were melted down into building material for the Hall of the Great Buddha at the H\u014dk\u014d-ji temple in Kyoto, that was built by Hideyoshi. This measure effectively stopped peasant revolts, and ensured greater stability at the expense of freedom of the individual \"daimy\u014d\".\nOdawara Campaign.\nIn 1590, Hideyoshi carried out the Odawara Campaign against the H\u014dj\u014d clan in the Kant\u014d region, in what historian Stephen Turnbull refers to as \"the most unconventional siege lines in samurai history\". The samurai were entertained by everything from concubines, prostitutes, and musicians to acrobats, fire-eaters, and jugglers. The defenders slept on the ramparts with their arquebuses and armor; despite their smaller numbers, they discouraged Hideyoshi from attacking. Hideyoshi had Ishigakiyama Ichiya Castle secretly constructed in a nearby forest.\nDuring the siege, Hideyoshi offered Ieyasu the eight H\u014dj\u014d-ruled provinces in the Kant\u014d region, in exchange for the submission of Ieyasu's five provinces, which Ieyasu accepted.\nIn late\u00a0September of the same year, an uprising broke out in\u00a0the Yokote Basin, Senboku district (Senboku District, Akita in post-Meiji era), in opposition to\u00a0the Taiko land survey\u00a0conducted\u00a0by\u00a0the Toyotomi government. Although the Senboku rebellion was suppressed later, the result was a disaster for the Onodera clan.\n1591 activities.\nIn February 1591, Hideyoshi ordered Sen no Riky\u016b to commit suicide, likely in one of his angry outbursts. Following Riky\u016b's death, Hideyoshi turned his attention from tea ceremony to Noh, which he had been studying since becoming Imperial Regent. During his brief stay in Nagoya Castle in what is today Saga Prefecture, on Ky\u016bsh\u016b, Hideyoshi memorised the \"shite\" (lead role) parts of ten Noh plays, which he then performed, forcing various \"daimy\u014d\" to accompany him onstage as the \"waki\" (secondary, accompanying role). He even performed before the emperor.\nThe Kunohe rebellion, an insurrection that occurred in Mutsu Province from March 13 to September 4, 1591, began when Kunohe Masazane, a claimant to daimyo of the Nanbu clan, launched a rebellion against his rival Nanbu Nobunao which spread across Mutsu Province. Nobunao was backed by Hideyoshi, who along with sent a large army into the T\u014dhoku region in mid-1591 which quickly defeated the rebels. Hideyoshi's army arrived at Kunohe Castle in early September. Masazane, outnumbered, surrendered Kunohe Castle and was executed with the castle defenders. The Kunohe rebellion was the final battle in Hideyoshi's campaigns during the Sengoku period and completed the unification of Japan.\nTaik\u014d (1592\u20131598).\nThe future stability of the Toyotomi dynasty after Hideyoshi's eventual death was put in doubt when his only son, three-year-old Tsurumatsu, died in September 1591, which followed his half-brother Hidenaga's death from illness earlier that year in February. Hideyoshi subsequently named his nephew Hidetsugu his heir, adopting him in January 1592. Hideyoshi resigned as \"kampaku\" to take the title of \"taik\u014d\" (retired regent), and Hidetsugu succeeded him as \"kampaku\".\nHideyoshi adopted Oda Nobunaga's dream of a Japanese conquest of China, and launched the conquest of the Ming dynasty by way of Korea (at the time known as Koryu or Joseon).\nIn 1592, Hideyoshi began an invasion of Korea with the intent of conquering Korea and eventually Ming China.99 In 1593, he attempted but failed at compelling Taiwan into a tributary relationship.60 Hideyoshi's explicit war goal was for Japan to replace China at the top of the international order.92 Hideyoshi wrote to his adopted son Hidetsugu that \"it is not Ming China alone that is destined to be subjugated by us, but India, the Philippines, and many islands in the South Sea will share a like fate.\"\nFirst campaign against Korea.\nIn the first campaign, Hideyoshi appointed Ukita Hideie as field marshal, and had him go to the Korean peninsula in April 1592. Konishi Yukinaga occupied Seoul, which was the capital of the Joseon dynasty of Korea, on June 19. After Seoul fell, Japanese commanders held a war council there in June and determined targets of subjugation called \"Hachidokuniwari\", literally . Each targeted province was attacked by one of the army's eight divisions:\nWithin four months, Hideyoshi's forces had a route into Manchuria and had occupied much of Korea. The Korean king Seonjo of Joseon escaped to Uiju and requested military intervention from China. In 1593, the Wanli Emperor of Ming China sent an army under general Li Rusong to block the planned Japanese invasion of China and recapture the Korean peninsula. On January 7, 1593, the Ming relief forces recaptured Pyongyang and surrounded Seoul, but Kobayakawa Takakage, Ukita Hideie, Tachibana Muneshige and Kikkawa Hiroie were able to win the Battle of Byeokjegwan north of Seoul, in modern day Goyang City. At the end of the first campaign, Japan's entire navy was destroyed by Admiral Yi Sun-sin of Korea, whose base was located in a part of Korea the Japanese could not control. This destroyed Japan's ability to resupply their troops in Seoul, effectively ending the invasion.\nSuccession dispute.\nFollowing Hideyoshi's appointment of his nephew Hidetsugu to the position of \"kampaku,\" tensions started to develop due to the dual power structure between Hidetsugu, who led the court system, and Hideyoshi, who retained actual military power as retired regent. Although Hideyoshi orchestrated Hidetsugu's rise, the regent's position was governed by established court frameworks, limiting Hideyoshi's ability to bypass precedents. This led to the formation of two factions: the \"\"Taiko\" (Hideyoshi's) group\" and the \"\"Kampaku\" (Hidetsugu's) group,\" which clashed over political and military issues.\nThe birth of Hideyoshi's second son in 1593, Hideyori, exacerbated these tensions, as it introduced another potential heir to the Toyotomi dynasty. In July 1595, amidst suspicions of treason and the ongoing Korean invasion, Hidetsugu was stripped of his titles, exiled to Mount K\u014dya, and then ordered to commit suicide in August 1595. Hidetsugu's family members who did not follow his example, including 31 women and several children, were then beheaded in Kyoto. In the aftermath, Hideyoshi solidified his authority by securing loyalty oaths, signed in blood, from magistrates and daimyos including influential damiyo like Tokugawa Ieyasu, Maeda Toshiie, Ukita Hideie, Mori Terumoto, and Kobayakawa Takakage.\nSecond campaign against Korea.\nAfter several years of negotiations, broken off because envoys of both sides falsely reported that the opposition had surrendered, Hideyoshi appointed Kobayakawa Hideaki to lead a renewed invasion of Korea. This invasion met with less success than the first; Japanese troops remained pinned down in Gyeongsang Province, and although the Japanese forces turned back several Chinese offensives in Suncheon and Sacheon in June 1598, they were unable to make further progress as the Ming army prepared for a final assault. While Hideyoshi's battle at Sacheon led by Shimazu Yoshihiro was a major Japanese victory, all three parties to the war were exhausted. He told his commander in Korea, \"Don't let my soldiers become spirits in a foreign land.\".\nDeath.\nToyotomi Hideyoshi died at Fushimi Castle on September 18, 1598 (Keich\u014d 3, 18th day of the 8th month). His last words, delivered to his closest \"daimy\u014d\" and generals, were \"I depend upon you for everything. I have no other thoughts to leave behind. It is sad to part from you.\" His death was kept secret by the Council of Five Elders to preserve morale, and they ordered Japanese forces in Korea to return to Japan.\nAccording to the \"Tokugawa Jikki\" record, Hideyoshi held a secret meeting with Koide Hidemasa and Katagiri Katsumoto where he shared his regret of launching invasions of Korea. Hideyoshi also instructed Hidemasa and Katsumoto to guide Hideyori into making an alliance with Ieyasu, as he predicted the power of the Tokugawa clan would grow unchecked after his death, and the only solution for the Toyotomi clan to survive was to not oppose Ieyasu.\nAfter Hideyoshi's death, the other members of the Council of Five Elders were unable to keep Ieyasu's ambitions in check. Two of Hideyoshi's top generals, Kat\u014d Kiyomasa and Fukushima Masanori, had fought bravely during the war but returned to find the Toyotomi clan castellan Ishida Mitsunari in power. He held the generals in contempt, and they sided with Ieyasu. Hideyori lost the power his father once held, and Ieyasu's power was consolidated when his Eastern Army defeated the Mitsunari's Western Army at the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. Ieyasu, who was appointed as a shogun in 1603 and established the Tokugawa shogunate, attacked Osaka Castle twice in 1614 and 1615 (the Siege of Osaka), forcing Hideyoshi's concubine Yodo-dono and Hideyori to commit suicide, destroying the Toyotomi clan.\nIt is now believed that Hideyoshi's loss of all his adult heirs, leaving only the five-year-old Hideyori as his successor, was the primary reason for the weakening of the Toyotomi regime and its eventual downfall.\nCharacter and policy analysis.\nDescribed as a \"hitotarashi\" (a person with natural charisma or a master charmer), Hideyoshi was skilled at winning people over and mastering human psychology. This resulted in favorable views from both his superiors and his subordinates, and for some opposing warlords to open up to him and agree to surrender after meeting him in person. According to Japanese historian , Hideyoshi had a deep inferiority complex which influenced his behavior after he became regent, as he often toyed with or pranked his vassals. This behavior may have stemmed from his humble origin and experiences during Nobunaga's lifetime, such as not being permitted to ride alongside other generals who hailed from samurai class and being required to dismount before bowing.\nReligious policy.\nIn 1587, while trying to establish control in some parts of Kyushu, Hideyoshi encountered Buddhist temples that had been sacked by Catholic forces attempting to forcibly convert the island. In response, he issued the Bateren Edict on June 19, 1587, which ordered the expulsion of Christian missionaries from Japan. Promulgated during Hideyoshi's campaign to unify Kyushu, the edict was a response to several perceived threats posed by Christianity, to exert greater control over the \"Kirishitan\" \"daimy\u014d\" or to prohibit human trafficking. Around that time, at least 50,000 Japanese people were sold overseas as slaves, mainly by Portuguese merchants. This stance was further shown in Hideyoshi's letter sent in 25 July 1590 to Alessandro Valignano, which content are similar the contents of a letter he sent to the ruler of Joseon. In those letters, Hideyoshi expressed his unique religious view that Indian Buddhism, Chinese Confucianism, and Japanese Shinto are fundamentally one unit, while also warned that he would no longer tolerate the propagation of Christianity (\"evil religion\" in Hideyoshi's letter), and he would no longer allow Christian missionaries to enter the country, albeit he still allowed merchants from Europe (Nanban) to enter and trade.\nIn January 1597, Toyotomi Hideyoshi had twenty-six Christians arrested as an example to Japanese who wanted to convert to Christianity. They are known as the Twenty-six Martyrs of Japan. They included five European Franciscan missionaries, one Mexican Franciscan missionary, three Japanese Jesuits and seventeen Japanese laymen including three young boys. They were tortured, mutilated, and paraded through towns across Japan. On February 5, they were executed in Nagasaki by public crucifixion.\nLegacy.\nBy 18 August 1915 Hideyoshi was given posthumous rank of Senior First Rank.\nToyotomi Hideyoshi changed Japanese society in many ways. These include the imposition of a rigid class structure, restrictions on travel, and surveys of land and production.\nClass reforms affected commoners and warriors. During the Sengoku period, it had become common for peasants to become warriors, or for samurai to farm due to the constant uncertainty caused by the lack of centralised government and always tentative peace. Upon taking control, Hideyoshi decreed that all peasants be disarmed completely. Conversely, he required samurai to leave the land and take up residence in the castle towns.\nFurthermore, he ordered comprehensive surveys and a complete census of Japan. Once this was done and all citizens were registered, he required all Japanese to stay in their respective \"han\" (fiefs) unless they obtained official permission to go elsewhere. This ensured order in a period when bandits still roamed the countryside and peace was still new. The land surveys formed the basis for systematic taxation.\nIn 1590, Hideyoshi completed construction of the Osaka Castle, the largest and most formidable in all Japan, to guard the western approaches to Kyoto. In that same year, Hideyoshi banned \"unfree labour\" or slavery in Japan, but forms of contract and indentured labour persisted alongside the period penal codes' forced labour.\nHideyoshi also influenced the material culture of Japan. He lavished time and money on the Japanese tea ceremony, collecting implements, sponsoring lavish social events, and patronizing acclaimed masters. As interest in the tea ceremony rose among the ruling class, so too did the demand for fine ceramic implements, and during the course of the Korean campaigns, not only were large quantities of prized ceramic ware confiscated but many Korean artisans were forcibly relocated to Japan.\nInspired by the dazzling Golden Pavilion in Kyoto, he had the Golden Tea Room constructed, which was covered with gold leaf and lined inside with red gossamer. Using this mobile innovation, he was able to practice the tea ceremony wherever he went, displaying his power and status at all times.\nPolitically, he set up a governmental system that balanced out the most powerful Japanese warlords (or \"daimy\u014d\"). A council was created to include the most influential lords. At the same time, a regent was designated to be in command.\nJust before his death, Hideyoshi hoped to set up a system stable enough to survive until his son grew old enough to become the next leader.\nIeyasu left in place the majority of Hideyoshi's decrees and built his shogunate upon them. This ensured that Hideyoshi's cultural legacy remained. In a letter to his wife, Hideyoshi wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I mean to do glorious deeds and I am ready for a long siege, with provisions and gold and silver in plenty, so as to return in triumph and leave a great name behind me. I desire you to understand this and to tell it to everybody.\nNames.\nThe Catholic sources of the time referred to him as (from and the honorific \"-dono\") and \"emperor \" (from \"taik\u014d\", a retired \"kampaku\" (see Sessh\u014d and Kampaku), and the honorific \"-sama\").\nIn popular culture.\nFilms.\nIn the 1949 Mexican hagiographic film \"Philip of Jesus\", Luis Aceves Casta\u00f1eda plays a character corresponding to Hideyoshi but named \"Emperor Iroyoshi Taikosama\".\nIn the 2009 Japanese historical fantasy film \"Goemon\", Toyotomi Hideyoshi (played by Eiji Okuda) features as the principal antagonist to the film's protagonist, Ishikawa Goemon. This is based on the tradition that Goemon was executed for his failed attempt to assassinate Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1594, but the film otherwise bears little resemblance to either historical events or the received tradition. In the film, Goemon murders Hideyoshi's stand-in, avoids his execution by boiling (being replaced by an associate), succeeds in murdering Hideyoshi on a later occasion, and survives to intervene in the Battle of Sekigahara. Goemon is portrayed as the faithful retainer and avenger of Oda Nobunaga, unhistorically depicted as the victim of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. All of this is counter to historical facts; tradition credits Goemon with serving Nobunaga's enemies the Miyoshi clan and his murderer, Akechi Mitsuhide, as well as with failed murder attempts on both Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi.\nHideyoshi is portrayed by actor/director Takeshi Kitano in his 2023 film \"Kubi\".\nAnime.\nIn the anime series \"Great Pretender\" (2020), Hideyoshi is referenced many times by Laurent Thierry, one of the central protagonists of the series.\nDocumentary.\nIn the Netflix documentary series \"\" (2021), Hideyoshi is portrayed by Masami Kosaka. The show depicts his life and rise to power.\nTelevision.\nActor Naoto Takenaka portrays Toyotomi Hideyoshi in the 1996 NHK drama \"Hideyoshi\", which shows his life from his time under Oda Nobunaga to his rise as a leader himself who helped to unify Japan. It earned an average TV rating of 30.5% running from January 7 \u2013 December 22, 1996. He would reprise this role again in Nioh 2. Additionally, actor Yukijir\u014d Hotaru plays The Taik\u014d (Nakamura Hidetoshi), a character based on Toyotomi Hideyoshi, in the 2024 miniseries \"Sh\u014dgun\".\nAppendix.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the third of the three \"Great Unifiers\" of Japan, along with his former lord Oda Nobunaga and fellow Oda subordinate Toyotomi Hideyoshi. The son of a minor daimyo, Ieyasu once lived as a hostage under daimyo Imagawa Yoshimoto on behalf of his father. He later succeeded as daimyo after his father's death, serving as ally, vassal, and general of the Oda clan, and building up his strength under Oda Nobunaga.\nAfter Oda Nobunaga's death, Ieyasu was briefly a rival of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, before declaring his allegiance to Toyotomi and fighting on his behalf. Under Toyotomi, Ieyasu was relocated to the Kanto plains in eastern Japan, away from the Toyotomi power base in Osaka. He built his castle in the fishing village of Edo (now Tokyo). He became the most powerful daimyo and the most senior officer under the Toyotomi regime. Ieyasu preserved his strength during Toyotomi's failed attempts to conquer Korea. After Hideyoshi's death and the Battle of Sekigahara, Ieyasu seized power in 1600.\nHe received appointment as \"sh\u014dgun\" in 1603, and voluntarily resigned from his position in 1605, although he still held the de facto control of government until his death in 1616. He implemented a set of careful rules known as the \"bakuhan\" system. This system used precisely graded rewards and punishments to encourage (or compel) the daimyo and samurai to live in peace with each other under the Tokugawa shogunate.\nEarly life (1543\u20131561).\nTokugawa Ieyasu was born in Okazaki Castle on the 26th day of the twelfth month of the eleventh year of Tenbun, according to the Japanese calendar, January 31, 1543 according to the Western calendar. Originally named , he was the son of , the daimyo of Mikawa of the Matsudaira clan, and , the daughter of a neighbouring samurai lord, . His mother and father were step-siblings. They were 17 and 15 years old, respectively, when Takechiyo was born.\nDuring the Muromachi period, the Matsudaira clan controlled a portion of Mikawa Province (the eastern half of modern Aichi Prefecture). Ieyasu's father, Matsudaira Hirotada, was a minor local warlord based at Okazaki Castle who controlled a portion of the T\u014dkaid\u014d highway linking Kyoto with the eastern provinces. His territory was surrounded by stronger and predatory neighbors, including the Imagawa clan based in Suruga Province to the east and the Oda clan to the west. Hirotada's main enemy was Oda Nobuhide, the father of Oda Nobunaga.\nIn the year of Takechiyo's birth, the Matsudaira clan split. Hirotada's uncle, Matsudaira Nobutaka defected to the Oda clan. This gave Oda Nobuhide the confidence to attack Okazaki. Soon afterwards, Hirotada's father-in-law died, and his heir, Mizuno Nobumoto, revived the clan's traditional enmity against the Matsudaira and declared allegiance to Oda Nobuhide as well. As a result, Hirotada divorced Odai-no-kata and sent her back to her family. Hirotada later remarried to different wives, and Takechiyo eventually had 11 half-brothers and sisters.\nHostage life.\nAs Oda Nobuhide continued to attack Okazaki, Hirotada turned to his powerful eastern neighbor, Imagawa Yoshimoto, for assistance. Yoshimoto agreed to an alliance under the condition that Hirotada send his young heir to Sunpu Domain as a hostage. Oda Nobuhide learned of this arrangement and had Takechiyo abducted. Takechiyo was five years old at the time. Nobuhide threatened to execute Takechiyo unless his father severed all ties with the Imagawa clan. However, Hirotada refused, stating that sacrificing his own son would show his seriousness in his pact with the Imagawa. Despite this refusal, Nobuhide chose not to kill Takechiyo, but instead held him hostage for the next three years at the Honsh\u014dji Temple in Nagoya. It was rumored that Oda Nobunaga met Takechiyo at the temple, when Takechiyo was six years old, and Nobunaga was 14. However, Katsuhiro Taniguchi reported there is no concrete historical records about this story of first meeting between Takechiyo with Nobunaga.\nIn 1549, when Takechiyo was six, his father Hirotada died of unknown causes. There was a popular theory that he was murdered by his vassals, who had been bribed by the Oda clan. However, a scholarly article published by Muraoka Mikio in 2015 states that the assassination theory is unreliable and Hirotada's death may have been caused by a natural illness.\nAround the same time, Oda Nobuhide died during an epidemic. Nobuhide's death dealt a heavy blow to the Oda clan.\nIn 1551, an army under the command of Imagawa Sessai laid siege to the castle where Oda Nobuhiro, Nobuhide's illegitimate eldest son, was living. Nobuhiro was trapped by the Imagawa clan but was saved through negotiation by Oda Nobunaga, Nobuhide's second son and heir. Sessai made an agreement with Nobunaga to take Takechiyo back to Imagawa, and he agreed. Takechiyo, now nine years old, was taken as a hostage to Sunpu.\nAt Sunpu, he was treated fairly well as a potentially useful ally of the Imagawa clan until 1556 when he was 14 years old. Yoshimoto decided that the Matsudaira clan's territory would be inherited by Takechiyo in the future, with the aim that the Imagawa clan could rule the area by extensions of their Matsudaira clan as their vassal, including Zuien-in (the daughter of Matsudaira Nobutada and Takechiyo's great-aunt), who was the only member of the Anjo Matsudaira clan left in Okazaki Castle.\nService under Imagawa clan.\nIn 1556, Takechiyo officially came of age, with Imagawa Yoshimoto presiding over his \"genpuku\" ceremony. Following tradition, he changed his name from Matsudaira Takechiyo to . He was also briefly allowed to visit Okazaki to pay his respects to the tomb of his father, and receive the homage of his nominal retainers, led by the \"kar\u014d\" Torii Tadayoshi.\nOne year later, at the age of 15 (according to East Asian age reckoning), he married his first wife, Lady Tsukiyama, a relative of Imagawa Yoshimoto, and changed his name again to . A year later, their son, Matsudaira Nobuyasu, was born. He was then allowed to return to Mikawa Province. There, the Imagawa ordered him to fight against the Oda clan in a series of battles.\nMotoyasu fought his first battle in 1558 at the siege of Terabe. The lord of Terabe, Suzuki Shigeteru (or Suzuki Shigetatsu), betrayed the Imagawa by defecting to Oda Nobunaga. This was nominally within Matsudaira territory, so Imagawa Yoshimoto entrusted the campaign to Motoyasu and his retainers from Okazaki. Motoyasu led the attack in person, but after taking the outer defences, he burned the main castle and withdrew. As anticipated, the Oda forces attacked his rear lines, but Motoyasu was prepared and drove off the Oda army.\nHe then succeeded in delivering supplies during the siege of Odaka Castle a year later. Odaka was one of five disputed frontier forts under attack by the Oda clan, and the only one that still remained under Imagawa control. Motoyasu launched diversionary attacks against the two neighboring forts and, when the garrisons of the other forts came to assist, Motoyasu's supply column was able to reach Odaka.\nBy 1559, the leadership of the Oda clan had passed to Oda Nobunaga. In 1560, Imagawa Yoshimoto, leading a large army of 25,000 men, invaded Oda territory. Motoyasu was assigned a separate mission to capture the stronghold of Marune in the Siege of Marune operation. As a result, he and his men were not present at the Battle of Okehazama where Yoshimoto was killed in a surprise assault by Nobunaga, In the end, Motoyasu managed to capture Marune castle.\nLater, in response to the news of Yoshimoto's death, Motoyasu sent lookouts to check the state of the battle and then retreated from Odaka Castle at midnight. After leaving Odaka Castle, Motoyasu's forces headed for Okazaki with Asai Michitada as their guide. On the way, they were stopped by the Mizuno clan's forces at Chiryu, but because Asai Michitada was with them, they were not attacked. Having escaped from danger, Motoyasu entered Daijuji Temple outside Okazaki Castle the following day.\nWith Imagawa Yoshimoto dead, and the Imagawa clan in a state of confusion, Motoyasu used the opportunity to assert his independence and marched his men back into the abandoned Okazaki Castle and reclaimed his ancestral seat. Motoyasu then decided to ally with Oda Nobunaga. Motoyasu's wife, Lady Tsukiyama, and infant son, Matsudaira Nobuyasu, were held hostage in Sunpu by Imagawa Ujizane, Yoshimoto's heir, so the deal was secret.\nIn 1561, Motoyasu openly ended his allegiance to the Imagawa clan and captured Kaminog\u014d castle. Kaminog\u014d was held by Udono Nagamochi. Resorting to stealth, Motoyasu forces under Hattori Hanz\u014d attacked under cover of darkness, setting fire to the castle and capturing two of Udono's sons. He then used them as hostages to exchange for his wife and son.\nIn September 13 1561, Motoyasu send his commanders to the battle of Fujinami Nawate,\u00a0one\u00a0of a series of battles between the Kira clan and Matsudaira clan over\u00a0Tojo\u00a0Castle, the residence of\u00a0the Tojo branch of the Kira clan. In this battle,\u00a0Kira Yoshiaki's chief\u00a0retainer, Tominaga Tadamoto, was killed by Honda Hirotaka at Fujinami\u00a0Nawate near the castle (near Seto Fujinami,\u00a0Kira-cho, Nishio City,\u00a0Aichi Prefecture\u00a0). Yoshiaki surrendered afterwards. However, Motoyasu also lost one of his commander, Okubo Tadah\u014d, who was killed by Tadatomo during the battle.\nIeyasu-Nobunaga Alliance (1562\u20131582).\nSometime in the aftermath of the Okehazama battle where Imagawa Yoshimoto was slain, Motoyasu formed the Kiyosu Alliance with Oda Nobunaga, daimyo lord of Owari Province and the head of the Oda clan.\nIn 1563, Matsudaira Nobuyasu, the first son of Motoyasu, was married to Oda Nobunaga's daughter Tokuhime. In February, Matsudaira Motoyasu changed his name to Matsudaira Ieyasu. Some historians believe that these actions provoked the pro-Imagawa faction, including the Sakurai and Okusa Matsudaira families, which led to the simultaneous uprising against Ieyasu in the following year.\nUnification of Mikawa.\nDuring this period, the Matsudaira clan faced a threat from the Ikk\u014d-ikki movement, in which peasants banded together with militant monks under the J\u014ddo Shinsh\u016b sect, and rejected the traditional feudal social order. Ieyasu undertook several battles to suppress this movement in his territories, including the Battle of Azukizaka (1564).\nSome of Ieyasu's vassals were in the Ikk\u014d-ikki ranks, notably Honda Masanobu and Natsume Yoshinobu, who had deserted him for the Ikk\u014d-ikki rebellion out of religious sympathy. However, many of Ieyasu's core vassals who were also followers of the sect, such as Ishikawa Ienari and Honda Tadakatsu, quickly abandoned the Ikk\u014d faith of J\u014ddo Shinsh\u016b and stayed loyal to Ieyasu in order to confront the rebels.\nOn January 15, 1564, Ieyasu decided to concentrate his forces to attack and eliminate the Ikk\u014d-ikki from Mikawa. In the Battle of Azukizaka, Ieyasu was fighting on the front lines and was nearly killed when he was struck by several bullets, but survived because they did not penetrate his armor. Both sides were using new gunpowder weapons which the Portuguese had introduced to Japan 20 years earlier. At the end of battle, the Ikk\u014d-ikki were defeated. By 1565, Ieyasu had become the master of all of Mikawa Province.\nIn 1566, as Ieyasu declared his independence from the Imagawa clan, he reformed the order of Mikawa province, starting with the Matsudaira clan, after he pacified Mikawa. This decision was made after he was counseled by his senior vassal Sakai Tadatsugu to abandon the clan's allegiance to the Imagawa clan. He also strengthened his power base by creating a military government system for the Tokugawa clan in Mikawa which was based on his hereditary vassals, the Fudai daimy\u014d. The system which was called \"Sanbi no gunsei\" (\u4e09\u5099\u306e\u8ecd\u5236) divided governance into three sections: Hatamoto-Senshi, Higashi (western) Mikawa, and Nishi (eastern) Mikawa.\nTokugawa clan.\nIn 1567, Ieyasu started the family name \"Tokugawa\", changing his name to the well-known Tokugawa Ieyasu. As a member of the Matsudaira clan, he claimed descent from the Seiwa Genji branch of the Minamoto clan. As there was no proof that the Matsudaira clan were descendants of Emperor Seiwa, the Emperor initially did not approve the appointment, citing the lack of a precedent for the Serada clan of the Seiwa Genji clan to be appointed as \"Mikawa-no-kami\" (Lord of Mikawa).\nIeyasu then consulted with imperial noble Konoe Motohisa through the mediation of a Mikawa native and the abbot of the Kyo Seiganji Temple. Due to Motohisa's efforts, Yoshida Kaneyoshi discovered a genealogical document in the \"Manri-koji\" family that was precedent, saying, \"Tokugawa (belongs) to Minamoto clan, as another offshoot of the Fujiwara clan,\" and a copy was transferred to him and used for the application. Ieyasu then gained the permission of the Imperial Court and he was bestowed the courtesy title \"Mikawa-no-kami\" and the court rank of .\nThough the Tokugawa clan could claim some modicum of freedom, they were very much subject to the requests of Oda Nobunaga. Ieyasu remained an ally of Nobunaga and his Mikawa soldiers were part of Nobunaga's army which captured Kyoto in 1568.\nIn 1568, at the same time, Ieyasu was eager to expand eastward to T\u014dt\u014dmi Province. Ieyasu and Takeda Shingen, the head of the Takeda clan in Kai Province, made an alliance for the purpose of conquering all the Imagawa territory. It is said that the Tokugawa clan had made an agreement with the Takeda clan when dividing the territory that the eastern Suruga Province would become Takeda territory and the western T\u014dt\u014dmi province would be Tokugawa territory, with the \u014ci River as the border.\nOn January 8, 1569, the Takeda vassal Akiyama Nobutomo invaded the T\u014dt\u014dmi province from Shinano Province. The Takeda clan, through Oda Nobunaga, with whom they had a friendly relationship, asked Ieyasu, who was Nobunaga's ally, to reconsider cooperation with the Takeda, but Ieyasu rejected the idea, demonstrating a degree of independence from Nobunaga.\nT\u014dt\u014dmi campaign.\nIn 1568, Ieyasu besieged the Horikawa Castle in T\u014dt\u014dmi and captured it in 1569. Ieyasu then ordered Ishikawa Hanzaburo to massacre the castle prisoners and residents, including women and children. It was recorded that around 700 people were beheaded on the banks of the Miyakoda River. \u014ckubo Tadachika, who witnessed this massacre testified in his personal journal, \"Mikawa Monogatari\", that \"... both men and women can be cut into pieces [\"sic\"]...\".\nLater the same year, Ieyasu's troops penetrated T\u014dt\u014dmi Province. Meanwhile, Takeda Shingen's troops captured Suruga Province, including the Imagawa capital of Sunpu. Imagawa Ujizane fled to Kakegawa Castle, which led Ieyasu to lay siege to Kakegawa.\nIeyasu then negotiated with Ujizane, promising that if Ujizane surrendered himself and the remainder of T\u014dt\u014dmi, Ieyasu would assist Ujizane in regaining Suruga. Ujizane had nothing left to lose, and Ieyasu immediately ended his alliance with Takeda, instead making a new alliance with Takeda's enemy to the north, Uesugi Kenshin of the Uesugi clan. Through these political manipulations, Ieyasu gained the support of the samurai of T\u014dt\u014dmi Province. Furthermore, Ieyasu also placed the \"Iinoya's trio\" (Iinoya-Sanninshu) of clans under the command of his trusted vassal, Ii Naomasa. The Iinoya trio were powerful clans that originated from the eastern side of Mikawa who greatly contributed to Ieyasu's expansion during his conquest of the former Imagawa territories in T\u014dt\u014dmi Province.\nIn 1570, Ieyasu established Hamamatsu as the capital of his territory, placing his son Matsudaira Nobuyasu in charge of Okazaki.\nCampaign against Asakura-Azai clan.\nAsakura Yoshikage, the head of the Asakura clan and regent of Ashikaga Yoshiaki, refused to come to Ky\u014dto. This caused Nobunaga to declare both of them rebels. Several reports from \"Mikawa Monogatari\", \"Nobunaga Koki\", \"Tokugawa Jikki\", and a supplement from \"Ietada Nikki\" recorded that Ieyasu and his forces also participated in Oda's punitive campaign against Asakura, in which they captured Mount Tenzutsu castle. The Oda-Tokugawa forces managed to kill 1,370 enemies on April 25.\nThey continued the next day by besieging Kanegasaki castle. However the Azai clan sent reinforcements to relieve the siege so Nobunaga retreated without contacting Ieyasu. After dawn, Ieyasu withdrew from battle guided by Kinoshita Tokichi (later named Toyotomi Hideyoshi), an Oda vassal.\nLater, in July 1570, the brother-in-law of Nobunaga, Azai Nagamasa, who had broken his alliance with the Oda clan during the siege of Kanegasaki, and Asakura combined to fight the combined armies of Nobunaga and Ieyasu, who led 5,000 of his men to support Nobunaga at the battle. As the Oda clan engaged the Azai clan army on the right, Tokugawa's forces engaged the Asakura clan's army on the left. At first, Asakura's army gained the advantage as they steadily pushed back the Tokugawa army. However, Honda Tadakatsu suddenly launched a lone, suicidal charge, while Sakakibara Yasumasa launched his force in a timely counterattack on Asakura's flank; together they managed to beat Asakura's forces. Since Ieyasu's army was now free to move, they exploited the gap between Asakura and Azai's forces and sent Tadakatsu and Yasumasa to attack the flank of Azai's formation, which allowed the Oda-Tokugawa forces to win the battle.\nSuruga campaign against Takeda clan.\nIn October 1571, Takeda Shingen broke the alliance with the Oda-Tokugawa forces and allied with the Odawara H\u014dj\u014d clan. He decided to make a drive for Kyoto at the urging of the sh\u014dgun Ashikaga Yoshiaki, starting by invading Tokugawa lands in T\u014dt\u014dmi. Takeda Shingen's first objectives in his campaign against Ieyasu were Nishikawa Castle, Yoshida Castle and Futamata Castle.\nIn 1572, after besieging Futamata, Shingen would press on past Futamata towards the major Tokugawa home castle at Hamamatsu. Ieyasu asked for help from Nobunaga, who sent him some 3,000 troops. Early in 1573, the two armies met at the Battle of Mikatagahara, north of Hamamatsu. The considerably larger Takeda army, under the expert direction of Shingen, overwhelmed Ieyasu's troops and caused heavy casualties. Despite his initial reluctance, Ieyasu was convinced by his generals to retreat. Later in his fortress Ieyasu brazenly ordered the men in his castle to light torches, sound drums, and leave the gates open, to properly receive the returning warriors. To the surprise and relief of the Tokugawa army, this spectacle made the Takeda generals suspicious that they were being led into a trap, so they did not besiege the castle and instead made camp for the night. This error allowed a band of Tokugawa soldiers to raid the camp in the ensuing hours, further upsetting the already disoriented Takeda army, and ultimately resulting in Shingen's decision to call off the offensive altogether. Takeda Shingen would not get another chance to advance on Hamamatsu, much less Kyoto, since he died from unknown causes shortly after the siege of Noda Castle later that same year.\nAround 1572 or 1573, according to various ptimary sources such as \"Shinch\u014d K\u014dki\", \"Mikawa Monogatari\" (\u4e09\u6cb3\u7269\u8a9e), \"Ietada nikki\"\u00a0(\u5bb6\u5fe0\u65e5\u8a18) and \"Mikawa T\u014ddai-ki\"\u00a0(\u4e09\u6cb3\u6771\u5927\u8a18), Nobunaga sent a letter to The authorities in Suruga Province that he assigned Ieyasu as the controller of the province.\nIn 1574, Shingen was succeeded by his son Takeda Katsuyori and the conflict continued as the Tokugawa forces under Honda Tadakatsu and Sakakibara Yasumasa seized many of the Takeda clan's castles, including Komyo Castle. At some point, Ieyasu tried to capture Inui Castle in T\u014dt\u014dmi Province, but strong resistance from its garrison commander, Amano Kagehira, forced Ieyasu to abort the siege. During their retreat, Kagehira launched a counterattack to pursue Ieyasu, but this was repelled by Mizuno Tadashige and Torii Mototada, who led the rearguard.\nIn April 1575, \u014cga Yashir\u014d, a deputy governor of over 20 villages in Oku district of Mikawa under Matsudaira Nobuyasu, was arrested by \u014ckubo Tadayo and paraded around Hamamatsu Castle. According to the investigation, Yashir\u014d was implicated in allegations of colluding with Takeda Katsuyori to betray Ieyasu and invade the Tokugawa clan's territory. According to a letter, Yashiro had teamed up with Takeda Katsuyori of Kai to seize Okazaki Castle. However, one of Yashiro's colleagues, Yamada Hachiz\u014d, betrayed Yashiro and passed this information to Nobuyasu. Meanwhile, Ieyasu himself also learned about Yashir\u014d's further crimes of corruption in governance through a vassal's report. Yashir\u014d was then executed by being mutilated alive with a saw, while Tadayo crucified his wife and children.\nIn June, during Takeda Katsuyori's raid on Mikawa Province when he attacked Yoshida Castle and besieged Nagashino Castle, Ieyasu appealed to Nobunaga for help; Nobunaga came personally with 30,000 men. The Oda-Tokugawa forces 38,000 strong won a great victory and successfully defended Nagashino Castle. Though the Takeda forces had been destroyed, Katsuyori survived the battle and retreated to Kai Province. For the next seven years, Ieyasu and Katsuyori fought a series of small battles through which Ieyasu's troops managed to wrest control of Suruga Province from the Takeda clan.\nNobuyasu Incident.\nIn 1579, Lady Tsukiyama, Ieyasu's wife, and his heir Matsudaira Nobuyasu were accused by Nobunaga of conspiring with Takeda Katsuyori to assassinate Nobunaga, whose daughter Tokuhime was married to Nobuyasu. Ieyasu ordered his wife to be executed and forced his son to commit \"seppuku\" because of these accusations.\nThere are various theories regarding this incident. According to the \"Mikawa Monogatari'\", which was written by \u014ckubo Tadachika, Tokuhime, wife of Nobuyasu, who was not on good terms with her mother-in-law Tsukiyama-dono, wrote in a letter to her father, Nobunaga, that her mother-in-law and her husband were secretly conspiring with Takeda Katsuyori.\nHowever, this hypothesis has been considered implausible by various historians in the modern era. According to Katsuhiro Taniguchi, the more plausible theory was that there was friction within the house of Tokugawa clan between two factions with conflicting ideals, as proposed by the writer Tenkyu Goro. One faction, dubbed the \"Hamamatsu Castle Faction,\" was active on the front lines and had many opportunities to advance their careers. The other faction was the \"Okazaki Castle Faction,\" which consisted of Tokugawa vassals responsible for logistical support due to past injuries and other factors that caused them to play a lesser role in the politics of Tokugawa clan. According to this theory, the conflict between these two factions eventually led to a conflict between Ieyasu, representing the Hamamatsu faction, and his son Nobuyasu, representing the Okazaki faction, finally ending with Nobuyasu's death in prison. Nobuyasu planned to exile Ieyasu with the help of the Okazaki Castle faction. Before and after his son's execution, Ieyasu punished or executed many of those who worked at Okazaki Castle, although some escaped. Taniguchi theorized that Tsukiyama also participated in the coup d'\u00e9tat that was going on in Okazaki Castle. Furthermore, Sakai Tadatsugu, the most prominent general of Ieyasu, also may have played a role in confirming Oda Nobunaga's suspicion of the alleged betrayal against the Oda clan being planned by Nobuyasu Tsukiyama. Ieyasu may have concluded that if a high-ranking fudai daimy\u014d such as Tadatsugu had confirmed the accusations against Lady Tsukiyama, then they must be true.\nAnother theory has said that Tadatsugu was actually conspiring with the Ieyasu's mother, Odai no Kata, to get rid of Lady Tsukiyama. Arthur Lindsay Sadler theorized this was a deliberate act of spite from Tadatsugu due to many senior Tokugawa clan generals' dislike of Nobuyasu.\nIn the same year, Ieyasu named his third son, Tokugawa Hidetada, as his heir, since his second son had been adopted by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who would later become a powerful daimyo.\nTakeda clan annihilation.\nIn 1580, Ieyasu built five fortresses in order to isolate Takatenjin Castle from external supplies and reinforcements. In addition to those five new fortresses, Ieyasu renovated an old castle named Ogasayama fort, which had originally been built by Ieyasu far before the conquest of T\u014dt\u014dmi Province against Imagawa clan to capture Kakegawa Castle. With the six fortresses, which were referred to as the \"six fortresses of Takatenjin\", completed, Ieyasu assigned Ishikawa Yasumichi to the Ogasayama fort, Honda Yasushige to the Nogasaka fort, Osuga Yasutaka to the Higamine, Shishigahana, and Nakamura forts, while Sakai Ietada was appointed to garrison the Mitsuiyama fort.\nThe Takatenjin castle which was defended by Okabe Motonobu, immediately suffered from a period of starvation as the siege by Oda-Tokugawa forces intensified. In response, Motonobu tried to negotiate a truce with Ieyasu by offering Takisakai and Koyama Castle in exchange for Takatenjin castle being spared from the siege. After Ieyasu consulted with Nobunaga on this matter, he refused Motonobu's plea. Nobunaga stated his reason in a letter saying that if Takeda Katsuyori sent his forces to assist Motonobu, then there would be an opportunity to bait the Takeda army into coming outside the castle and annihilate them on the field. Meanwhile, Nobunaga also stated that if Katsuyori neglected helping Motonobu at all, it would damage the Takeda clan's credibility because they could not save their own vassals.\nIn 1581, Ieyasu forces managed to subdue Tanaka castle, and recapture Takatenjin castle, where Okabe Motonobu was killed during the fight.\nThe end of the war with Takeda Katsuyori came in 1582, when a combined Oda-Tokugawa force attacked and conquered Kai Province, where Katsuyori was cornered and defeated at the Battle of Tenmokuzan, and then committed \"seppuku\". With the Takeda clan practically annihilated as political entity, Nobunaga gave Ieyasu the right to govern Suruga Province in recognition of his service in the fight against the Takeda clan.\nTokugawa expansions (1582\u20131584).\nIn late June 1582, before the incident at Honn\u014d-ji temple, Oda Nobunaga invited Ieyasu to tour the Kansai region in celebration of the demise of the Takeda clan. Before the meeting could take place, Ieyasu learned that Nobunaga had killed himself at Honn\u014d-ji temple after being surrounded and overwhelmed by the forces of Akechi Mitsuhide.\n\"Shinkun Iga-goe\" journey.\nWhen Ieyasu heard that Nobunaga had been killed by Akechi Mitsuhide he had only a few companions with him, notably Sakai Tadatsugu, Ii Naomasa, Honda Tadakatsu, Sakakibara Yasumasa and some others. The Iga provincial route was dangerous because of the \"Ochimusha-gari\", or \"Samurai hunters\" gangs. Ieyasu and his party, therefore, chose the shortest route back to Mikawa Province by crossing Iga Province. The exact route differs in many versions according to primary sources \"Tokugawa Nikki\" or \"Mikawa Todai-Hon\":\nRegardless which theory was true, historians agreed that when his path ended at Kada (a mountain pass between Kameyama and Iga), the Tokugawa group suffered one last attack by Ochimusha-gari outlaws as they reached the territory of K\u014dka ikki clans of Jizamurai who were friendly to the Tokugawa clan. The Koka ikki samurais assisted Ieyasu in eliminating the threat of the Ochimusha-gari outlaws and escorted them until they reached Iga Province, where they were further protected by other allied clans from Iga ikki who accompanied Ieyasu and his group until they safely reached Mikawa.\nPortuguese missionary Lu\u00eds Fr\u00f3is recorded in his work \"History of Japan\" that during this journey, Tokugawa retainers including Sakai Tadatsugu, Ii Naomasa and Honda Tadakatsu fought their way out of raids and harassment from Ochimusha-gari outlaws while escorting Ieyasu, while paying bribes of gold and silver to those Ochimusha-gari outlaws that could be bribed. Matsudaira Ietada recorded in his journal, \"Ietada nikki\" (\u5bb6\u5fe0\u65e5\u8a18), the Ieyasu's escorts suffered around 200 casualties during their journey, and when they arrived at Ietada's residence in Mikawa, they only had about 34 personnel left, including high-ranking Tokugawa generals including Tadatsugu, Naomasa, Tadakatsu, Sakakibara, \u014ckubo Tadayo, Hattori Hanz\u014d, and others.\nTensh\u014d-Jingo war.\nAfter Ieyasu reached Mikawa, he immediately moved to shift his focus to former Takeda clan territory as he expected unrest there. As a preemptive measure, Ieyasu dispatched Honda Nobutoshi to contact Kawajiri Hidetaka, who ruled Suwa District as a vassal of the Oda clan, to request cooperation.\nMeanwhile, Ieyasu had Yoda Nobushige, the former Takeda clan governor of the Saku district who had been hidden in the Tokugawa territory and had maintained contact with Ieyasu, organize contacts with the other remaining vassals of the Takeda clan to restore order in the chaos following the death of Nobunaga. At that moment, Nobushige was settled in the secluded village of Osawa. At the same time, Uesugi and the H\u014dj\u014d clans also mobilized their forces to invade Shinano Province, K\u014dzuke Province, and Kai Province (currently Gunma Prefecture), which were ruled by the remnants of the many small clans that formerly served the Takeda clan, when they learned of the death of Nobunaga. This caused a triangular conflict between those three factions known as the .\nPreliminary movements.\nAt first, the H\u014dj\u014d clan, who ruled the Kant\u014d region, led an army of 55,000 men to invade the Shinano Province through Usui, as they aimed to prevent a Tokugawa incursion of Kai. By June 13, 1582, the H\u014dj\u014d clan had captured Iwadono Castle in Tsuru District and instructed Watanabe Shozaemon, a local magistrate from the Tsuru District, to assist them in their conquest. Subsequently, Sanada Masayuki led his army and captured the Numata Castle for the Uesugi clan.\nMeanwhile, Ieyasu immediately marched his 8,000 soldiers to the disputed regions and then split his army into two parts, with the separate detachment led by Sakai Tadatsugu and Ogasawara Nobumine going to pacify the Shinano Province, while Ieyasu took the main force to pacify Kai. Tadatsugu and Nobumine met with unexpected resistance from Suwa Yoritada, a former Takeda vassal who was now allied with the H\u014dj\u014d clan. They were beaten by Yoritada, who were then reinforced by the H\u014dj\u014d clan, forcing Tadatsugu to retreat. As Tadatsugu's forces retreated, they were pursued by 43,000 men of the H\u014dj\u014d clan army. Okabe Masatsuna, a member of the Suruga clan samurai who once served under Baba Nobuharu, took the initiative to defend the rear of Tadatsugu's army from the enemy charges and repelled them. As they successfully retreated without further losses, they rejoined Ieyasu's main forces in the area of Wakamiko in Suwamachi (modern day Yamanashi Prefecture).\nOn June 5, Ieyasu instructed Orii Tsugumasa and Yonekura Tadatsugu, two members of Takekawa clan from Kai who were hiding in Kiriyama, T\u014dt\u014dmi Province, to proceed with the work of enticing the Kai samurai to the Tokugawa side. The next day, Ieyasu also sent a letter to Masatsuna instructing him to begin the construction of a castle at Shimoyama, Minobu Town in the Kai Kawachi domain, the former base of Anayama Nobutada, one of Tokugawa's retainers who was killed by outlaws during his escape after the Honn\u014d-ji Incident. Suganuma Castle (Terazawa, Minobu Town) was built along the Fuji River and the Suruga Highway (Kawachi Road). After the death of Nobutada and the senior members of the Obikane clan, to which they had pledged loyalty, the Anayama clan was left leaderless, so they decided to pledge allegiance to Ieyasu.\nIeyasu then dispatched , formerly one of Shingen Takeda's three most prominent generals, to the Erinji area with 500 men to confront a H\u014dj\u014d force that numbered 3,000 men. Masatada managed to defeat them and inflicted between 600 and 700 casualties. On June 12, Masatada joined forces with another former Takeda vassal, , and a senior Tokugawa general, Osuga Yasutaka. The same day, Yoda Nobushige set off to Saku District and rallied around 3,000 Takeda clan retainers as Ieyasu instructed.\nLater on June 28, Ieyasu also dispatched the Anayama clan to resist the H\u014dj\u014d clan. He also sent his generals \u014ckubo Tadayo, Ishikawa Yasumichi and Honda Hirotaka along with his son Yasushige as reinforcements for them to resist the H\u014dj\u014d.\nAt some point during this war, the Tokugawa clan also gained support from the .\nUesugi Kagekatsu of the Uesugi clan also made his move by supporting former Takeda clan forces under the leadership of Ogasawara D\u014dsetsusai from the Ogasawara clan and Yashiro Hidemasa at Chikuma and the Nishina clan of Azumino. They defeated and expelled Kiso Yoshimasa, who had been granted the control of both Chikuma and Azumino by Oda Nobunaga. They then faced another branch of Ogasawara clan which was led by Ogasawara Sadayoshi and his retainers which opposed the steps taken by D\u014dsetsusai. Sadayoshi's group appealed to the Tokugawa clan and offered their allegiance to Ieyasu. On June 24, Kagekatsu advanced into northern Shinano and entered Naganuma castle.\nAs the triangular battle was underway between the three factions, order was restored in Owari province as the rebellion of Akechi Mitsuhide had already been suppressed in the Battle of Yamazaki. Ieyasu also informed the Oda clan of the developments in Shinano and Kai. In response, on July 7, as the Oda clan learned of the defeat of Takigawa Kazumasu by the H\u014dj\u014d clan at the Battle of Kanagawa, Toyotomi Hideyoshi sent a letter to Ieyasu to give him authorization to lead military operations to secure the two provinces of Kai and Shinano from the H\u014dj\u014d and Uesugi clans.\nAftermath of Tensh\u014d-Jingo war.\nThe problems for the H\u014dj\u014d clan increased by the day as Ieyasu established contact with daimyo lords from north-east Japan including the Satake, Yuki, and Utsunomiya clans, who threatened to invade the H\u014dj\u014d from behind while the H\u014dj\u014d were still engaging Ieyasu in battle. As the war turned in favor of Ieyasu, combined with the defection of Sanada Masayuki to the Tokugawa side, the H\u014dj\u014d negotiated a truce with Ieyasu.\nThe H\u014dj\u014d clan sent H\u014dj\u014d Ujinobu as representative, while the Tokugawa sent Ii Naomasa as representative for the preliminary meetings. Representatives from the Oda clan, Oda Nobukatsu, Oda Nobutaka, and Toyotomi Hideyoshi who mediated the negotiation from October 1582, also assisted the ratification of the truce. Sanada Nobutada, a younger brother of Sanada Masayuki, was given 5,000 koku of territory by Ieyasu, and Okabe Masatsuna was rewarded with a 7,600 koku domain in between Kai and Shinano provinces. In the aftermath of the war, Ieyasu once again sent Tadatsugu to subdue Suwa Yoritada at Suwa in Shinano in December, where Tadatsugu defeated Yoritada and secured his surrender to the Tokugawa clan.\nIn March 1583, according to the record, after the destruction of the Takeda clan in the Tenmokuzan, Ieyasu with many samurai clans, local lords, low rank officials, ninja mercenaries, and even noble ladies that were formerly vassals of the Takeda clan in order to put them under the command of Tokugawa clan retainers. Since the ritual took place after the Tensh\u014d-Jingo war and in the same location, this oath taking ritual was named \"Tensh\u014d-Jingo kish\u014dmon\". During the process of the oath-taking Tokugawa, Ieyasu planned to give control of most of the former Takeda samurai to Ii Naomasa to command, having consulted and reached agreement with Sakai Tadatsugu, a senior Tokugawa clan vassal. However, Ieyasu's decision garnered protest from Sakakibara Yasumasa, who went so far as to threaten Naomasa. Tadatsugu immediately defended Ieyasu's decision in response and warned Yasumasa that if he did any harm to Naomasa, Tadatsugu would personally slaughter the Sakakibara clan; Yasumasa backed down and did not protest further. As there were no more protests, Ieyasu decided to assign the new recruits to various commands, as following: \nAside from the already established workforces from the former Takeda clan, Ieyasu also established new offices such as the Hachi\u014dji sen'nin-d\u014dshin, which formed from a patchwork membership of nine small clans of Takeda retainers. This group continued to serve the Tokugawa clan faithfully until they were disbanded during the Meiji Restoration in 1868.\nIn 1583, Ieyasu had a detachment of Ii Naomasa's troops conquer the Takat\u014d area of Shinano, which had still not submitted to the Tokugawa clan. Meanwhile, Nobushige led the attack against the Tomono clan, and defeated them.\nIn the middle of operation, Yoda Nobushige was killed in action. Yoda Yasukuni, who succeeded him as head of the Yoda clan, was given the surname Matsudaira and Komoro Castle. The territory he was allowed to inherit was 60,000 koku, one of the largest for any of Ieyasu's vassals at the time. Yashiro Hidemasa, who surrendered to Ogasawara Sadayoshi, also joined the Tokugawa clan later on April 1, 1584, together with his younger brother Ogasawara Mitsutoshi.\nIeyasu did not take a side during the Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Shibata Katsuie conflict, where Hideyoshi defeated Katsuie at the Battle of Shizugatake.\nIeyasu and Hideyoshi (1584\u20131598).\nEarthquakes and conflict with Hideyoshi.\nAs the Tokugawa clan's territory expanded, many of their regions were hit by earthquakes and heavy rains from 1583 to 1584. In particular, from May to July, heavy rains fell constantly from the Kant\u014d region to the T\u014dkai region, in what was dubbed the \"heaviest flood in 50 years\" in the historical record of \"Ietada-nikki\". It was under these circumstances that the Tokugawa clan was forced to fight against the H\u014dj\u014d clan and the Toyotomi government, because in 1584 Ieyasu had decided to support Oda Nobukatsu, the eldest surviving son and heir of Oda Nobunaga, against Toyotomi Hideyoshi. The \"Ryumonji Kojiki\", written by successive chief priests at Ryumonji Temple in Tahara, Mikawa Province, records that in 1582 many people were mobilized in the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute, which led to the devastation of farmland and famine.\nThe devastation of the Tokugawa clan's territory made it difficult to continue fighting against the Toyotomi government and they were forced to rebuild their country. This was a dangerous situation for the Tokugawa clan which could have resulted in their annihilation due to the Oda clan collapsing after Nobunaga's death.\nTokugawa troops took the traditional Oda stronghold of Owari. Hideyoshi responded by sending an army into Owari. Ieyasu decided to confront Hideyoshi's forces in Komaki because his general, Sakakibara Yasumasa, suggested the area was favorable for the Tokugawa force to fight incoming enemies from the west. Additionally, Ieyasu and Nobukatsu formed an anti-Hideyoshi alliance with Ch\u014dsokabe Motochika, through contact with K\u014dsokabe Chikayasu.\nAt first, Ieyasu ordered his generals Mizuno Tadashige and Mizuno Katsunari to capture Hoshizaki Castle. Then, as the Toyotomi army vanguard under the command of Toyotomi Hidetsugu started entering the area of Komaki, Ieyasu sent Yasumasa and Osuga Yasutaka in for a surprise attack and inflicted heavy losses on the Hidetsugu army before they were stopped by Hori Hidemasa. Hidemasa decided to retreat when Ieyasu brought his main forces forward.\nLater, as another Toyotomi vanguard led by Mori Nagayoshi entered the area, Ieyasu had his senior generals, Sakai Tadatsugu, Okudaira Nobumasa, and Matsudaira Ietada, beat Nagayoshi's troops, forcing him to retreat. In the last phase of this series of engagements, Nagayoshi returned with another Toyotomi general Ikeda Tsuneoki. However, both of them were repeatedly beaten on the field at Nagakute by Mizuno Katsunari, and later, Ii Naomasa, caused the Toyotomi forces to suffer heavy losses with both Tsuneoki and Nagayoshi killed in action.\nFurious with the decimation of Nagayoshi's and Tsuneoki's forces, Hideyoshi mobilized his main army to crush Ieyasu's army in Nagakute. However, Ieyasu had already retreated before Hideyoshi's main forces arrived.\nAfter the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute in April, the front line in northern Owari reached a stalemate. At this time, Kanie Castle was located about three miles between Ieyasu's Kiyosu Castle and Nobuo's Nagashima Castle, and was connected to the Mie moat and three castles: Ono Castle, Shimojima Castle, and Maeda Castle. At that time, Kanie Castle was facing the sea and was one of the leading ports in Owari, along with Atsuta and Tsushima. Then on June 18, Ieyasu and Nobuo led 20,000 soldiers and besieged three castles: Kanie Castle, Maeda Castle, and Shimojima Castle. Kanie Castle was defended by Maeda Nagatane and Takigawa Kazumasu. Tadatsugu, Okanabe Mori, and Yamaguchi Shigemasa spearheaded the attack towards Shimojima castle, while Sakakibara Yasumasa, Osuga Yasutaka were deployed to capture any fleeing defenders.\nDuring this siege, Ieyasu's hatamoto retainers, including Mizuno Katsunari, blockaded the port of the castle and hijacked two ships belonging to Kuki Yoshitaka to prevent any outside help for Kanie Castle. After the fall of Shimojima castle on June 22, Oda Nobuo and Tokugawa Ieyasu launched an all-out attack on Kanie Castle. The soldiers led by Tadatsugu, who had been deployed at the main gate, were exhausted after days of fierce fighting, and in the evening, the soldiers of Yasumasa Sakakibara and Ietada Matsudaira entered Kaimonjiguchi in their place. On June 23, Ieyasu entered the castle with Sakakibara Yasumasa, subduing the castle.\nBecoming a vassal of the Toyotomi Regency.\nThe conflict with Hideyoshi was long, and lasted until Nobukatsu decided to surrender to Hideyoshi. With this, Ieyasu lost his motivation to further oppose Hideyoshi and decided to also submit. After peace negotiations between Tokugawa Ieyasu and Toyotomi Hideyoshi in the aftermath of the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute, Naomasa, Tadakatsu, and Yasumasa gained fame in Kyoto. The following month, the three of them were joined by Tadatsugu Sakai while accompanying Ieyasu on a trip to Kyoto, where the four of them became famous.\nHowever, on November 13, 1585, Ishikawa Kazumasa defected from Ieyasu to Hideyoshi. Ogasawara Sadayoshi, who also defected and followed Kazumasa, led over 3,000 troops to attack Takato. In Takato Castle there were only 40 cavalrymen and 360 soldiers other than the elderly Hoshina Masatoshi, but Masatoshi himself took command and defeated the Ogasawara forces in open battle. This prevented the collapse of Tokugawa rule in Shinano and Ieyasu awarded Masanao with the sword of Tsunehisa on December 24 in recognition of his military achievements.\nThese incidents caused Ieyasu to undertake massive reforms of the Tokugawa clan governmental structure by incorporating more Takeda clan vassals into his administrations, both civil and military. At first, Ieyasu ordered Torii Mototada, who served as the county magistrate of Kai, to collect military laws, weapons, and military equipment from the time of Takeda Shingen and bring them to Hamamatsu Castle in Hamamatsu City, Shizuoka Prefecture. Later, he appointed two former Takeda vassals, Naruse Masakazu and Okabe Masatsuna, as magistrates under authority of Ii Naomasa and Honda Tadakatsu. He ordered all former Takeda vassals who served him to impart any military doctrines and structures they knew from their service to the Takeda clan., He ordered three of his prime generals, Ii Naomasa, Honda Tadakatsu, and Sakakibara Yasumasa, to serve as the supreme commanders of these new military regiments. The same year, Hideyoshi forced his younger sister Asahi no kata to divorce her husband, who then committed suicide, and sent her to Ieyasu with the offer of marrying her.\nIn 1586, in response to Ishikawa Kazumasa's defection from the Tokugawa clan, former Takeda clan vassals from Kai and Shinano province, including Yonekura Tadatsugu, sought to reaffirm their loyalty to Ieyasu by presenting their family members as hostages.\nLater the same year, Hideyoshi sent his own mother as a hostage to Ieyasu. If Ieyasu continued to refuse to go to Kyoto after such a gesture, it would give Hideyoshi a just cause for war. Ieyasu finally decided to become Hideyoshi's vassal.\nRuling Kant\u014d and suppressing rebellions.\nIn 1590 May, Ieyasu participated in the campaign against the H\u014dj\u014d clan. Odawara, which was the last H\u014dj\u014d clan stronghold, saw almost no significant military action, with the exception of Ii Naomasa's night raid attack. This happened after a group of miners from Kai Province dug under the castle walls, allowing troops under Naomasa to enter and engage the enemy. After the surrender of the H\u014dj\u014d clan, Ieyasu sent Naomasa and Sakakibara Yasumasa with 1,500 soldiers to witness the seppuku of the defeated enemy generals, H\u014dj\u014d Ujimasa and H\u014dj\u014d Ujiteru. As result of his distinguished service during the campaign, Naomasa was awarded with an increase in his domain to 120,000 koku. Daid\u014dji Masashige, a senior H\u014dj\u014d clan retainer, was also forced to commit seppuku by Hideyoshi, however, his children were spared from execution at the behest of Ieyasu. The eldest son, Daid\u014dji Naoshige, became Ieyasu's vassal after the death of Ujinao.\nOn October 28 of the same year, a massive revolt against the Toyotomi government in Mutsu Province was incited by Hienuki Hirotada and Waga Yoshitada. In response, Hideyoshi sent a punitive expedition with an army 30,000 strong led by Ieyasu Tokugawa, Toyotomi Hidetsugu, Date Masamune, Ishida Mitsunari, \u014ctani Yoshitsugu, Gam\u014d Ujisato, Uesugi Kagekatsu, Satake Yoshishige, and Maeda Toshiie in order to pacify the rebellion.\nIn 1591, Ieyasu gave up control of his five provinces (Mikawa, T\u014dt\u014dmi, Suruga, Shinano, and Kai) and moved all his soldiers and vassals to his eight new provinces in the Kant\u014d region. The proclamation of this decision happened on the same day as Hideyoshi entered Odawara castle after the H\u014dj\u014d clan formally surrendered. The moment Ieyasu was appointed to rule Kant\u014d, he immediately assigned his premier vassals, including Ii Naomasa, Honda Tadakatsu, Sakakibara Yasumasa, and Sakai Ietsugu, the son of Sakai Tadatsugu, to each control a large area of the former H\u014dj\u014d clan territories in Kant\u014d. Historians saw this step as aimed at bringing order to the newly subdued population of the area, while also guarding the eastern domains from any influence or threat from the Satomi clan, which had not yet submitted to Toyotomi rule at that time. Meanwhile, Ieyasu himself established his personal seat of power in Edo town, which at that time was an underdeveloped town in Kant\u014d.\nHistorian Adam Sadler saw this step as the riskiest Ieyasu ever made\u2014to leave his home province and rely on the uncertain loyalty of the former H\u014dj\u014d clan samurai in Kant\u014d. In the end, it worked out brilliantly for Ieyasu. He reformed the Kant\u014d region, controlled and pacified the H\u014dj\u014d samurai, and improved the underlying economic infrastructure. Also, because Kant\u014d was somewhat isolated from the rest of Japan, Ieyasu was able to ally with daimyo of north-eastern Japan including Date Masamune, Mogami Yoshiaki, Satake Yoshishige and Nanbu Nobunao; he was also able to maintain a unique level of autonomy from Toyotomi Hideyoshi's rule. Within a few years, Ieyasu had become the second most powerful daimyo in Japan. An anecdotal proverb says, \"Ieyasu won the Empire by retreating.\"\nModern Japanese historians reject that this was a deliberate move by Ieyasu since it was an order from Hideyoshi. Nevertheless, stated that, while the general opinion was that Ieyasu was reluctant about his transfer to Kant\u014d, this perception was unfounded. Instead, Daimon suspected that Ieyasu actually responded to this transfer positively as he saw potential in making undeveloped Edo into his seat of power.\nSimilarly, And\u014d Y\u016bichir\u014d viewed this transfer as an advantage for the Tokugawa regime in the long run, as this move was not only doubled the territory that he controlled, but it further added numerous new vassals in Kant\u014d to the already impressive political and military power of the Tokugawa regime, which had already absorbed the armies of the Imagawa and Takeda clans before. Y\u016bichir\u014d added that aside from the samurai from Imagawa, Takeda, and H\u014dj\u014d, the Mikawa samurai clans who were traditional followers of the Tokugawa clan also lost their sense of independence after being transferred into a new unfamiliar territory, which increased their sense of dependence on Ieyasu, in effect further minimizing the possibility of them going renegade and betraying Ieyasu, as Ishikawa Kazumasa had done several years earlier.\nAfter the Waga-Hienuki rebellion, the Kunohe rebellion led by Kunohe Masazane broke out on March 13, 1591. This caused the punitive expedition army to split their forces as Ieyasu, Naomasa, Ujisato, and some commanders changed their focus to suppress Masazane's rebellion first. Ieyasu, who at that time was also busy suppressing rebellions with his main commanders, including Sakakibara Yasumasa, Ii Naomasa, and Honda Tadakatsu, arrived at Iwatesawa, Tamazukuri district, Mutsu (modern day Iwadeyama, Miyagi Prefecture) on August 18, where he camped until October and led the troops.\nDuring the operation against the Kunohe clan rebels, Naomasa Ii became the vanguard with Nanbu Nobunao. As they advanced towards Kunohe castle, they faced a small force of Kunohe rebels which they easily defeated. Naomasa suggested to besiege the castle until they surrendered, which was met with agreement.\nOn 4 September, the rebels executed the prisoners inside the castle and incited mass suicide after setting fire to the castle. The castle burned for three days and nights killing all within. The rebellions were suppressed by June 20, with Waga Yoshitada being slain in battle, while Hienuki Hirotada was sentenced to \"\" which stated that his and his clan's status and rights as samurai were stripped.\nAs the operation ended, Ieyasu returned to Edo on October 29 and began managing his new territory in the Kant\u014d region. Ieyasu managed to establish his home base in Kant\u014d, and built sustainable economic infrastructure in the region. Ieyasu also employed , head of the gold mining and metal industries of the Sengoku period, to mint gold coins and establish a bank-like institution for the Tokugawa clan's government.\nIn 1592, Toyotomi Hideyoshi invaded Korea as a prelude to his plan to attack China. The Tokugawa clan samurai didn't take part in this campaign, as Hideyoshi had ordered the eastern provinces' daimyo including Ieyasu, Uesugi Kagekatsu, and Date Masamune to maintain logistical support for the war effort in Nagoya Castle.\nIn 1593, Toyotomi Hideyoshi fathered a son and heir, Toyotomi Hideyori. Later, though still in early 1593, Ieyasu himself was summoned to Hideyoshi's court in Nagoya (in Kyushu, not the similarly spelled city in Owari Province) as a military advisor and was given command of troops meant as reserves for the Korean campaign. Ieyasu stayed in Nagoya intermittedly for the next five years.\nIn July 1595, the \"Toyotomi Hidetsugu Incident\" occurred. In response to this major incident shaking the Toyotomi government, Hideyoshi ordered various daimyo to come to Kyoto in an attempt to calm the situation. Ieyasu also came to Kyoto on Hideyoshi's orders. From this point on, Ieyasu spent longer and longer periods in Fushimi Castle than in his underdeveloped residence, Edo Castle. Due to this chain of events, Ieyasu's position in the Toyotomi government had risen, but by being at the center of the government, Ieyasu was able to learn directly about the central government's political system.\nRuler of Japan (1598\u20131603).\nIn 1598, with his health clearly failing, Hideyoshi called a meeting that would determine the Council of Five Elders, who would be responsible for ruling on behalf of his son after his death. The five that were chosen as tair\u014d (regents) for Hideyori were Maeda Toshiie, M\u014dri Terumoto, Ukita Hideie, Uesugi Kagekatsu, and Ieyasu, who was the most powerful of the five. This change in the pre-Sekigahara power structure became pivotal as Ieyasu turned his attention towards Kansai; at the same time, other ambitious (albeit ultimately unrealized) plans, such as the Tokugawa initiative establishing official relations with New Spain (modern-day Mexico), continued to unfold and advance.\nDeath of Hideyoshi and Toshiie.\nToyotomi Hideyoshi, after three more months of deteriorating health, died on September 18, 1598. He was nominally succeeded by his young son Hideyori but as he was just five years old, the real power was in the hands of the regents. There were several incidents involving Ieyasu after the death of Hideyoshi:\nThe next day, the seven generals surrounded Fushimi Castle with their soldiers as they knew Mitsunari was hiding there. Ieyasu, who was in charge of political affairs in Fushimi Castle at that moment, attempted to arbitrate the situation. The seven generals requested Ieyasu hand over Mitsunari, which Ieyasu refused. Ieyasu then negotiated a promise to let Mitsunari retire and to review the assessment of the Battle of Ulsan Castle in Korea. Ieyasu had his second son, Y\u016bki Hideyasu, escort Mitsunari to Sawayama Castle.\nIeyasu also gained support from Mogami Yoshiaki, brother-in-law of Masamune and a powerful eastern daimyo, who had held a grudge against the Toyotomi clan since Hideyoshi executed his daughter in the Hidetsugu Incident of 1595. Hidetsugu had been accused of treason and forced to commit seppuku at Mount K\u014dya. In the aftermath of this incident, his entire family was also executed at Sanjogawara. Yoshiaki's daughter, Komahime, who was only 15 years old and had recently married Hidetsugu, was executed as a result. Yoshiaki begged for her life to be spared as she hadn't even met Hidetsugu yet, but his request was refused. Komahime was beheaded along with the others, and her body dumped in the Sanjogawara River. As result of the execution, Yoshiaki's wife, Osaki-dono, was struck with deep grief by the sudden death of her daughter and died on August 16. After this, Yoshiaki grew closer to Ieyasu and became one of his strongest supporters.\nConflict with Mitsunari.\nMeanwhile, opposition to Ieyasu centered around Ishida Mitsunari, one of Hideyoshi's \"Go-Bugy\u014d\", or top administrators of Hideyoshi's government, and a powerful daimyo who was not one of the regents. Mitsunari plotted Ieyasu's death and news of this plot reached some of Ieyasu's generals. They attempted to kill Mitsunari but he fled and gained protection from Ieyasu. It is not clear why Ieyasu protected a powerful enemy from his own men, but Ieyasu was a master strategist and may have concluded that he would be better off with Mitsunari leading the enemy army rather than one of the more legitimate regents.\nNearly all of Japan's daimyo and samurai were now split into two factions; the Western Army (Mitsunari's group) and the Eastern Army (Ieyasu's group). Ieyasu had the support of the anti-Mitsunari group, and formed them into his potential allies. Ieyasu's allies were Kat\u014d Kiyomasa, Fukushima Masanori, Mogami Yoshiaki, Hachisuka Iemasa, the Kuroda clan, the Hosokawa clan and many daimyo from eastern Japan. Mitsunari had allied himself with three other regents: Ukita Hideie, M\u014dri Terumoto, and Uesugi Kagekatsu, as well as with \u014ctani Yoshitsugu, the Chosokabe clan, the Shimazu clan and many daimyo from the western end of Honsh\u016b.\nWar became imminent when Uesugi Kagekatsu, one of Hideyoshi's appointed regents, defied Ieyasu by building up his military at Aizu. When Ieyasu officially condemned him and demanded that he come to Kyoto to explain himself, Kagekatsu's chief advisor, Naoe Kanetsugu, responded with a counter-condemnation that mocked Ieyasu's abuses and violations of Hideyoshi's rules. This infuriated Ieyasu.\nIn July 1600, Ieyasu was back in Edo and his allies moved their armies to defeat the Uesugi clan, which were accused of planning to revolt against the Toyotomi administration. On September 8, Ieyasu received information that Mitsunari had captured Fushimi castle and his allies had moved their army against Ieyasu. Ieyasu held a meeting with the Eastern Army daimyo, and they agreed to follow Ieyasu. Later, on September 15, Mitsunari's Western army arrived at Ogaki Castle. On September 29, Ieyasu's Eastern Army took Gifu Castle. On October 7, Ieyasu and his allies marched along the T\u014dkaid\u014d, while his son Hidetada went along through Nakasend\u014d with 38,000 soldiers (a battle against Sanada Masayuki in Shinano Province delayed Hidetada's forces, and they did not arrive in time for the main Battle of Sekigahara).\nBattle of Sekigahara.\nThe Battle of Sekigahara was the biggest battle as well as one of the most important in Japanese feudal history. It began on October 21, 1600. The Eastern Army led by Tokugawa Ieyasu initially numbered 75,000 men, with the Western Army at a strength of 120,000 men under Ishida Mitsunari. Ieyasu had also secretly acquired a supply of arquebuses.\nKnowing that the Tokugawa forces were heading towards Osaka, Mitsunari decided to abandon his positions and marched to Sekigahara. Even though the Western Army had tremendous tactical advantages, Ieyasu had already been in contact with many of the daimyo in the Western Army for months, promising them land and leniency after the battle should they switch sides. Ieyasu had also secretly communicated with Toyotomi Hideyoshi's nephew, Kobayakawa Hideaki. With a total of 170,000 soldiers facing each other, the Battle of Sekigahara ensued and ended with an overwhelming Tokugawa victory. At the conclusion of the battle, Ieyasu marched to Osaka castle, where M\u014dri Terumoto, the grand commander of Western army, surrendered to him.\nThe Western bloc quickly collapsed, and over the next few days Ishida Mitsunari and other western leaders such as Konishi Yukinaga and Ankokuji Ekei were captured and executed. However, Ieyasu was angry at his son Hidetada, whose army was late to arrive, leading to an unexpectedly long siege against Ueda castle. Sakakibara Yasumasa offered an explanation and testified in defense of Hidetada. Meanwhile, Ieyasu pardoned his enemies who defended Ueda castle, including Sanada Masayuki and Sanada Yukimura, at the behest of Ii Naomasa and Sanada Nobuyuki.\nAftermath of Sekigahara battle.\nIeyasu redistributed the domain fiefs of all the daimyo lords who supported him during the war, such as increasing Ii Naomasa domain to 180,000 koku. Ikeda Terumasa's to 520,000 Koku. T\u014dd\u014d Takatora got a new domain which was assessed at a total of 200,000 koku, Yuki Hideyasu went from 101,000 to 569,000 koku, Matsudaira Tadayoshi went from 100,000 to 520,000 koku, Gam\u014d Hideyuki increased from 180,000 to 600,000 koku, Maeda Toshinaga went from 835,000 to 1,100,000 koku, Kat\u014d Kiyomasa's domain grew from 195,000 to 515,000 koku, and Kuroda Nagamasa's grew from 180,000 to 523,000 koku. Meanwhile, Fukushima Masanori had his 200,000 koku domain increased to 498,000 in Aki, Hiroshima. Ieyasu also promoted many of his own hereditary vassals to domains of at least 10,000 koku for their stipends. After the battle, Ieyasu left some Western Army daimyo unharmed, such as the Shimazu clan, but others were completely destroyed. Toyotomi Hideyori (the son of Hideyoshi) lost most of his territory which was under management of western daimyo, and was degraded to an ordinary daimyo, rather than a Sessh\u014d or Kampaku (regent) of the Japanese empire. In later years, the vassals who had pledged allegiance to Ieyasu before Sekigahara became known as the \"fudai daimy\u014d\", while those who pledged allegiance to him after the battle (after his power was unquestioned) were known as \"tozama daimy\u014d\". \"Tozama daimy\u014d\" were considered inferior to \"fudai daimy\u014d\". This redistribution of domains was done verbally, instead of by formal letter of intent. Historian Watanabe Daimon suspected this was because Ieyasu was still wary of the existence of Toyotomi clan which had been inherited by Toyotomi Hideyori.\nOn September 20, Ieyasu entered Otsu castle, where he welcomed and met with Ky\u014dnyo, the head of Hongan-ji temple at that time, with Kanamori Nagachika as an intermediary. He met Ieyasu again the following year (1601), and Ieyasu visited Ky\u014dnyo on July 5 and August 16. However, for the rest of 1601, the relationship between them grew worse as Ky\u014dnyo was accused of pro-Mitsunari sympathy. It was only in February 1602 that the communication between Ieyasu with Ky\u014dnyo opened again. This was after the intercession from aide Honda Masanobu, where the three of them discussed the condition of the Hongan-ji temple development after the split of the sect into two factions. Ieyasu worried the strife within the temple could affect the stability of Japan after the Sekigahara war.\nIn 1602, Ieyasu changed his surname from \"Minamoto\" to \"Fujiwara\". The reason for this changing was because Emperor Go-Y\u014dzei wanted to appoint Ieyasu to be a court noble. However, there was no precedent in the Tokugawa bloodline as the Minamoto clan which Ieyasu ancestry claimed, was a samurai clan rather than a noble family. To resolve this problem, a fabrication was made that said the Tokugawa clan also descended from Fujiwara clan, which was a noble family. By changing his name to Fujiwara, Ieyasu was able to be appointed to the rank of Junior Fifth Rank.\nEstablishment of the Tokugawa shogunate (1603\u20131616).\nOn March 24, 1603, Tokugawa Ieyasu received the title of \"sh\u014dgun\" from Emperor Go-Y\u014dzei. In the same day, he also appointed as Minister of the Right, \"Overall Head of the Minamoto-Genji clan\" (), and also \"Chief Attendant of the Bullock-cart Proclamation\".\nIeyasu was 60 years old and had outlasted all the other great men of his times: Oda Nobunaga, Takeda Shingen, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and Uesugi Kenshin. As \"sh\u014dgun\", he used his remaining years to create and solidify the Tokugawa shogunate, which ushered in the Edo period, and was the third shogunal government (after the Kamakura and the Ashikaga). He claimed descent from the Minamoto clan who had founded the Kamakura shogunate, by way of the Nitta clan. His descendants would marry into the Taira clan and the Fujiwara clan.\nFollowing a well established Japanese pattern, Ieyasu abdicated his official position as \"sh\u014dgun\" in 1605. His successor was his son and heir, Tokugawa Hidetada. There may have been several factors that contributed to his decision, including his desire to avoid being tied up in ceremonial duties, to make it harder for his enemies to attack his real power center, and to secure a smoother succession for his son.\nIn 1604, T\u014dd\u014d Takatora and Date Masamune advised the shogunate government to introduce a rule across Japan that each feudal lord was obliged to maintain a residence in Edo, the capital of the shogunate, which Ieyasu immediately accepted and implemented officially.\n\"\u014cgosho\" (1605\u20131616).\nFrom 1605 onwards, Ieyasu, who had retired from the official position of shogun and became a , remained the effective ruler of Japan until his death. Ieyasu retired to Sunpu Castle in Sunpu, but he also supervised the building of Edo Castle, a massive construction project which lasted for the rest of Ieyasu's life. The result was the largest castle in all of Japan. The cost of building the castle was borne by all the other daimyo, while Ieyasu reaped the benefits. The central donjon, or \"tenshu\", burned in the 1657 \"Meireki\" fire. Today, the Imperial Palace stands on the site of the castle.\nEdo became the center of political power and the \"de facto\" capital of Japan, although the historic capital of Kyoto remained the \"de jure\" capital as the seat of the emperor. Furthermore, Ieyasu had the Imperial Court appoint his eldest remaining son, Hidetada, as Shogun, announcing to the world that the position of shogun would be hereditary to the Tokugawa clan from then on. At the same time, he requested Toyotomi Hideyori meet the new shogun, but Hideyori refused. In the end, the matter was resolved by sending his sixth son, Matsudaira Tadateru to Osaka Castle. At the same time, the next generation of Tokugawa clan vassals, including Ii Naotaka and Itakura Shigemasa, were also appointed.\nIn 1608, Ieyasu assigned control of the Tsu Domain to Takatora. It was reported that the landholdings which Takatora received in Iga province had previously belonged to a lord named Tsutsui Sadatsugu. Ieyasu stripped Tsutsui Sadatsugu of ownership rights before giving them to Takatora. The initial pretext was Sadatsugu's sloppy governance of the domain however, historians have argued that the real reason was because Sadatsugu behaved suspiciously by visiting Toyotomi Hideyori at Osaka Castle, without approval of the shogun, while the land which Sadatsugu occupied was considered to be an important military strategic location. Furthermore, it is thought that Ieyasu expropriated the land and gave it to the Todo clan as political strategy against the Toyotomi clan, even though he was a patron of the Toyotomi family, T\u014dd\u014d Takatora was considered a close ally of Ieyasu. Thus by putting him in control of portions of Iga province, the influence of the shogunate could be expanded to more strategic locations without directly provoking the Toyotomi faction in Osaka.\nIn 1611, (Keicho 16), Ieyasu, at the head of 50,000 men, visited Kyoto to witness the enthronement of Emperor Go-Mizunoo. While in Kyoto, Ieyasu ordered the remodeling of the Imperial Court, buildings, and forced the remaining western daimyo to sign an oath of fealty to him. On April 12, Ieyasu presented three articles of legislation to the daimyo in Kyoto. These Three Laws, as they were called, referred to the first shogun's set of laws and those that signed would strictly abide by the laws issued by the shogunate from then on. Second, the lords swore to not conceal those who disobeyed the shogun's orders, and third: to not hide or give shelter to any enemy of the state. 22 daimyo from the Hokuriku region and Western provinces agreed to the three articles of legislation and submitted an oath. Daimyo from Oshu and Kanto were not included in this list, because they were engaged in the construction of Edo Castle and did not come to Kyoto. In January of the following year, 11 major feudal lords from Oshu and Kanto swore to the Three Laws. 50 small and medium-sized fudai and tozama feudal lords also swore to the Three Laws, and Ieyasu succeeded in making all the feudal lords in the country his vassals.\nIeyasu did not have Hideyori work on national construction, nor did he have him swear to the Three Laws. Watanabe Daimon saw that the Three Laws issued by Ieyasu was a maneuver to isolate Hideyori politically by making all other influential daimyo lords obey him.\nIn 1613, he composed the , a document which put the court daimyo under strict supervision, leaving them as mere ceremonial figureheads.\nIn 1615, Ieyasu prepared the , a document setting out the future of the Tokugawa regime.\nRelations with Catholics.\nAs \u014cgosho, Ieyasu also supervised diplomatic affairs with the Netherlands, Spain, and England. Ieyasu chose to distance Japan from European influence starting in 1609, although the shogunate still granted preferential trading rights to the Dutch East India Company and permitted them to maintain a \"factory\" for trading purposes.\nFrom 1605 until his death, Ieyasu frequently consulted English shipwright and pilot, William Adams. Adams, a Protestant fluent in Japanese, assisted the shogunate in negotiating trading relations, but was cited by members of the competing Jesuit and Spanish-sponsored mendicant orders as an obstacle to improved relations between Ieyasu and the Roman Catholic Church.\nIn 1612, the Nossa Senhora da Gra\u00e7a incident occurred in Nagasaki, where the bugy\u014d official of Sakai Hasegawa Fujihiro had trouble with Portuguese captain Andr\u00e9 Pessoa. The conflict escalated when Pessoa and the merchants from Macau petitioned Ieyasu directly to complain about Hasegawa and Murayama T\u014dan, a magistrate of Ieyasu. When the Jesuits learned of this affair, they were horrified when they found out about Pessoa's petition as they knew that Hasegawa's sister Onatsu was a favorite concubine of Ieyasu.\nLater, Pessoa withdrew his petition when he learned of the internal politics of the shogunate. However, Fujihiro refused to forgive Pessoa's petition. Fujihiro encouraged Arima Harunobu, who wanted to retaliate for the prior Macau incident, to petition Ieyasu for the capture of Pessoa and the seizure of his merchant ship. Ieyasu, who had entrusted Harunobu with the purchase of agarwood, was initially concerned that a retaliatory act would cut off trade with Portuguese ships. Thus, the shogunate took a lenient attitude to Pessoa, as Honda Masazumi, with authorization from Ieyasu, gave Pessoa's envoy written assurances that Japanese sailors would be forbidden to travel to Macau, and any who did could be handled according to Portuguese laws. However, Ieyasu later gave Harunobu permission to capture Pessoa after he had been guaranteed that Manila ships of Spanish merchants would be able to replenish raw silk and other goods carried by Portuguese ships and also expected Dutch ships to continue arriving. Then Ieyasu gave authorization to Hasegawa and Arima Harunobu.\nAfter several days of battle, which resulted in Pessoa's death, the remaining Portuguese merchants and missionaries were increasingly concerned about their fates, especially since Ieyasu had personally ordered their execution. Harunobu, who was Catholic, interceded on behalf of the Jesuits. Ieyasu changed his decision and the merchants were allowed to leave for Macau with their property. Ieyasu's Jesuit translator, Jo\u00e3o Rodrigues T\u00e7uzu, was replaced by William Adams. Ieyasu then expelled Jo\u00e3o Rodrigues from Japan.\nIn 1612, the Okamoto Daihachi incident occurred where Okamoto Daihachi (\u5ca1\u672c\u5927\u516b, baptismal name Paulo), a Christian aide to the r\u014dj\u016b Honda Masazumi, and Arima Harunobu, were implicated in series of crimes including bribery, conspiracy, forgery, and attempt to murder Hasegawa Fujihiro. Ieyasu was angered when he heard that Catholic followers had gathered at Okamoto's execution to offer prayers and sing hymns.\nin 1614, Ieyasu was sufficiently concerned about Spanish territorial ambitions and signed the Christian Expulsion Edict. The edict banned the practice of Christianity and led to the expulsion of all foreign missionaries although some smaller Dutch trading operations remained in Nagasaki.\nConflict with Hideyori.\nThe last remaining threat to Ieyasu's rule was Toyotomi Hideyori, the son and rightful heir to Hideyoshi. He was now a young daimyo living in Osaka Castle. Many samurai who opposed Ieyasu rallied around Hideyori, claiming that he was the rightful ruler of Japan. Ieyasu found fault with the opening ceremony of a temple (Great Buddha of Kyoto) built by Hideyori; it was as if he prayed for Ieyasu's death and the ruin of the Tokugawa clan. Ieyasu ordered Hideyori to leave Osaka Castle, but those in the castle refused and summoned samurai to gather within the castle. Then in 1614, Ieyasu besieged Osaka Castle.\nTokugawa forces, with a huge army led by Ieyasu and \"sh\u014dgun\" Tokugawa Hidetada, laid siege to Osaka Castle in what is now known as \"the Winter Siege of Osaka\". Eventually, the Tokugawa were able to force negotiations and an armistice after cannon fire threatened Hideyori's mother, Yodo-dono. However, once the treaty had been agreed on, the Tokugawa filled in the castle's outer moats with sand so their troops could walk across. Through this ploy, Tokugawa gained a huge tract of land through negotiation and deception that they could not have gained through siege and combat. Ieyasu returned to Sunpu Castle, but after Toyotomi Hideyori refused another order to leave Osaka, Ieyasu and his allied army of 155,000 soldiers attacked Osaka Castle again in \"the Summer Siege of Osaka\".\nIn late 1615, Osaka Castle fell and nearly all the defenders were killed, including Hideyori, his mother (Toyotomi Hideyoshi's widow, Yodo-dono), and his infant son. His wife, Senhime (a granddaughter of Ieyasu), pleaded to save Hideyori and Yodo-dono's lives. Ieyasu refused and either required them to commit seppuku, or killed both of them. Eventually, Senhime was sent back to the Tokugawa clan alive. With the Toyotomi line finally extinguished, no threats remained to the Tokugawa clan's domination of Japan.\nFinal year &amp; death.\nAfter the conflict with Toyotomi Hideyori, Ieyasu implemented the Buke shohatto code, which stated that each daimyo lord was only allowed to possess one castle.\nIn 1616, Tokugawa Ieyasu died at the age of 73. The cause of death is thought to have been cancer or syphilis. The first Tokugawa \"sh\u014dgun\" was posthumously deified with the name T\u014dsh\u014d Daigongen (), the \"Great Gongen, Light of the East\". (A \"Gongen\" is believed to be a buddha who has appeared on Earth in the shape of a \"kami\" to save sentient beings). In life, Ieyasu had expressed the wish to be deified after his death to protect his descendants from evil. His remains were buried at the Gongens' mausoleum at Kun\u014dzan, Kun\u014dzan T\u014dsh\u014d-g\u016b (). Many people believe that after the first anniversary of his death, his remains were reburied at Nikk\u014d Shrine, Nikk\u014d T\u014dsh\u014d-g\u016b (), and that his remains are still there. Neither shrine has offered to open the graves, and the location of Ieyasu's physical remains is still a mystery. The mausoleum's architectural style became known as \"gongen-zukuri\", that is \"gongen\"-style.\nHe was first given the Buddhist name Tosho Dai-Gongen (), then, after his death, it was changed to Hogo Onkokuin (). During this time, the chief physician who cared for him, Sotetsu Katayama, diagnosed Ieyasu with stomach cancer. However, Ieyasu misinterpreted Katayama's diagnosis of his illness as a tapeworm infestation. Thus, he did not take the medicine Sotetsu had prepared, and instead continued his own method of therapy which he believed could cure his perceived tapeworm problem. This resulted in Ieyasu's health continually deteriorating.\nAlthough his son, Hidetada, also warned him about his medical method, this only served to anger Ieyasu, who arrogantly overvalued his own knowledge in the medical field. This conflict over his medical care ended when Ieyasu exiled Sotetsu to the Shinshu Takashima Domain.\nAt the time of his death, Ieyasu had an estimated personal wealth of about 4 million koku, which extended to 8 million koku for the total of the Tokugawa clan. He also possessed about 42 tons of gold as the Tokugawa shogunate had implemented the centralization of gold and silver mine ownership, unlike previous eras of government in Japan, in which possession of mine ownership was managed by local lords through the shogunate authorization.\nThe Tokugawa shogunate would rule Japan for the next 260 years.\nPersonal information.\nA historical evaluation of Ieyasu by , a historian on the faculty at Kyushu University, has compared Ieyasu's upbringing to that of another Sengoku era leader, M\u014dri Terumoto. Mitsunari contrasted Terumoto's upbringing in the comfortable and stable domains of the M\u014dri clan, as opposed to the hardships Ieyasu faced during his childhood, in which he experienced instability in Mikawa province, spending much his youth as a hostage of other warlords; in his view these differences formed each leader's character, as reflected in the Sekigahara battle, where the indecisiveness of Terumoto cost the Western army greatly, while Ieyasu's bold decisions and his willingness to take risks gave him the edge during the war.\nJohn T. Kuehn saw Ieyasu as being capable of complex long game strategies, both politically and militarily, as shown during his conflict against Ishida Mitsunari. Kuehn saw the Siege of Fushimi Castle as Ieyasu's deliberate strategy to sacrifice the castle and to bait Mitsunari into a set-piece battle, where his battle-hardened forces had an advantage over Mitsunari's forces.\nOn the other hand, Kazuto Hong\u014d has compared Ieyasu to Nobunaga as Ieyasu had insight to ensure the stability of the nation by the optimization and utilization of the abilities of his vassals rather than relying on the power of single individuals, as well as establishing succession systems. Tetsuo Owada personally praised how Ieyasu managed to be quickly accepted by the citizens of the Kant\u014d region and his ability to rule there without unrest after he transferred there, by continuing the lenient tax policies of the H\u014dj\u014d clan in order to gain sympathy.\nHamada Koichiro from Himeji Dokkyo University has recorded that there is a systematic attempt of historiography studies in the aftermath of the Meiji Restoration to portray Ieyasu in a negative light as a \"cunning old man\" who used the temple's bell of Hokoji as casus belli to wage war against Hideyori. Koichiro saw this tendency of Ieyasu to resort to underhanded tactics as being quite justified to some extent for different reasons. One example was his attempt at suppressing the Mikawa Ikk\u014d-ikki rebellion by breaking his promise of leniency to J\u014ddo Shinsh\u016b's followers in exchange for their surrender. However, Koichiro also points out that Ieyasu was also capable of bravery as showed by personally entering the battlefield during the rebellion, while also pointing out several anecdotes about Ieyasu as a youth showing promise as a capable military tactician when he still under the wing of the Imagawa clan.\nTokugawa also known for his vindictiveness. It is said that Ieyasu once executed a man who came within his power because he had insulted him when Ieyasu was young.\nAccording to professor Watanabe Daimon, one of the biggest strengths of Ieyasu's policies was his benevolence towards his subordinates and his capability to forgive his enemies and even his own generals who betrayed him during the Mikawa Ikk\u014d-ikki uprising. This allowed him to gain the loyalty of the Mikawa samurai clans. As an example, during the battle of Mikatagahara, those who shielded Ieyasu and even gave their lives to allow his retreat were the ones who once fought against Ieyasu in the past and had been pardoned.\nAt the same time, he was also ruthless when crossed. For example, he ordered the executions of his first wife and his eldest son, a son-in-law of Oda Nobunaga; Nobunaga was also an uncle of Hidetada's wife Oeyo. According to George Sansom, Ieyasu was cruel, relentless and merciless in the elimination of Toyotomi survivors after the Siege of Osaka. For days, scores of men and women were hunted down and executed, including an eight-year-old son of Toyotomi Hideyori by a concubine, who was beheaded. However, Ieyasu also known to be capable of forgiveness, such as how he gave pardon to Watanabe Moritsuna after he rebelled against Ieyasu during the Ikk\u014d-ikki uprisings in Mikawa.\nUnlike Toyotomi Hideyoshi, he harbored no desires to conquer outside of Japan, only wanting to bring order, an end to open warfare, and to rule Japan.\nIeyasu's favorite pastime was falconry. He regarded it as excellent training for a warrior.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"When you go into the country hawking, you learn to understand the military spirit and also the hard life of the lower classes. You exercise your muscles and train your limbs. You have any amount of walking and running and become quite indifferent to heat and cold, and so you are little likely to suffer from any illness.\"\nIeyasu swam often; even late in his life he is reported to have swum in the moat of Edo Castle.\nArmors &amp; weapons.\nMany sets of armors are said to have been used by Ieyasu, and at least 10 pieces of armor were used by Ieyasu during his life and recorded in history.\nWhile warlords at the time preferred flashy armor and frontlets to show off their presence, the 'Hada Gusoku' armor used by Ieyasu in the Siege of Osaka is a jet black armor with very few decorations, and is said to represent Ieyasu's frugal personality.\nLike Hideyoshi, Ieyasu also presented armor to Europe, and there is a record of the \"Moji-i Domaru Armor\" at Ambras Castle in Austria being a gift from \"the Emperor and Empress of Japan to Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II.\" This armor has the same characteristics as the aforementioned \"Hanairo Hinomaru-i Domaru Armor\" and armor presented by Hidetada to King James I of England in 1613, and is believed to have been presented by Ieyasu between 1608 and 1612. The armor has the characters for on the front of the torso and left sleeve, and on the back of the torso and right sleeve, woven with red thread.\nQuotes.\nLife is like unto a long journey with a heavy burden. Let thy step be slow and steady, that thou stumble not. Persuade thyself that imperfection and inconvenience are the lot of natural mortals, and there will be no room for discontent, neither for despair. When ambitious desires arise in thy heart, recall the days of extremity thou hast passed through. Forbearance is the root of all quietness and assurance forever. Look upon the wrath of thy enemy. If thou only knowest what it is to conquer, and knowest not what it is to be defeated; woe unto thee, it will fare ill with thee. Find fault with thyself rather than with others.\nThe strong manly ones in life are those who understand the meaning of the word patience. Patience means restraining one's inclinations. There are seven emotions: joy, anger, anxiety, adoration, grief, fear, and hate, and if a man does not give way to these he can be called patient. I am not as strong as I might be, but I have long known and practiced patience. And if my descendants wish to be as I am, they must study patience.\nIt is said that he fought, as a warrior or a general, in 90 battles.\nHe was interested in various kenjutsu skills, was a patron of the Yagy\u016b Shinkage-ry\u016b school, and also had them as his personal sword instructors.\nReligion.\nTokugawa Ieyasu was known for his devotion to the J\u014ddo-sh\u016b school of Buddhism throughout his life, having been born into the Matsudaira clan which followed J\u014dd\u014d Buddhism. As a way of demonstrating his constant favor towards the sect, he moved his familial temple to the Z\u014dj\u014d-ji Temple in Edo and funded massive renovations to older J\u014ddo temples, including the head temple of Chion-in in Kyoto, while also financing the creation of several new temples. After confiding in the abbot of Z\u014dj\u014d-ji temple about wanting to become a deity to protect his country, he was given advice to regularly recite the nembutsu for the purpose of being born into Amida Buddha's Pure Land of Sukhavati, where he would be able to easily attain Buddhahood and protect his descendants and the entire nation of Japan. Ieyasu readily accepted this advice, and constantly repeated the nembutsu until the day he died. Despite his personal devotion to J\u014ddo-sh\u016b, Ieyasu was not a strict sectarian, placing his secretary Dench\u014dr\u014d, a Rinzai Zen monk, in charge of all religious affairs in Japan, Buddhist and Shinto alike.\nLater in life he also took to scholarship and Confucianism, patronizing scholars like Hayashi Razan.\nWhile at first tolerant of Christianity, his attitude changed after 1613, and persecution of Christians sharply increased, with Ieyasu completely banning Catholicism in 1614. The hostility of Ieyasu towards Catholics was shown when he replaced Jesuit translator Jo\u00e3o Rodrigues T\u00e7uzu with William Adams in his court. This change of attitude is believed to be due to the Okamoto Daihachi incident, where a Catholic daimyo and shogun's official were accused of a series of crimes. After the execution of Daihachi, Ieyasu reportedly said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If they see a condemned fellow, they run to him with joy, bow to him, and do him reverence. This they say is the essence of their belief. If this is not an evil law, what is it? They truly are the enemies of the Gods and of Buddha.\nIn popular culture.\nIeyasu's life and accomplishments were used as a model for the Japanese statesman Lord Yoshi Toranaga, portrayed in James Clavell's historical novel \"Sh\u014dgun\". The 1980 television miniseries adaptation of the novel, starring Toshiro Mifune as Toranaga, and the 2024 miniseries, starring Hiroyuki Sanada as Toranaga, both used Ieyasu as a key reference.\n2019 Netflix documentary Age of Samurai: Battle for Japan discusses the infighting in Japan during the late 16th century, or the Sengoku period, in detail. It starts with the ascension of Oda Nobunaga to how finally Ieyasu became the Shogun of Japan in 1600.\nThe NHK show is a Japanese historical drama television series depicting a semi-fictional history of Tokugawa Ieyasu which starred Jun Matsumoto as Ieyasu.\nTokugawa Ieyasu appears as a leader of Japan in every \"Civilization\" game except \"Civilization V\".\nThe \"\" expansion pack has a Japanese campaign which focuses on the unification of Japan and the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate with a fictional protagonist Sakuma Kichiro serving under Tokugawa Ieyasu.\nTokugawa Ieyasu appears in episode 63 of season 2 of \"Dinosaur King\".\nAppendix.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a non-SI unit accepted for use with SI. It is also referred to as a metric ton in the United States to distinguish it from the non-metric units of the short ton (United States customary units) and the long ton (British imperial units). It is equivalent to approximately 2,204.6 pounds, 1.102 short tons, and 0.984 long tons. The official SI unit is the megagram (Mg), a less common way to express the same amount.\nSymbol and abbreviations.\nThe BIPM symbol for the tonne is t, adopted at the same time as the unit in 1879. Its use is also official for the metric ton in the United States, having been adopted by the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). It is a symbol, not an abbreviation, and should not be followed by a period. Use of lower case is significant, and use of other letter combinations can lead to ambiguity. For example, T, MT, mT, are the SI symbols for the tesla, megatesla, and millitesla, respectively, while Mt and mt are SI-compatible symbols for the megatonne (one teragram) and millitonne (one kilogram). If describing TNT equivalent units of energy, one megatonne of TNT is equivalent to approximately 4.184 petajoules.\nOrigin and spelling.\nIn English, \"tonne\" is an established spelling alternative to \"metric ton\". In American English and British English, tonne is usually pronounced the same as ton (), but the final \"e\" can also be pronounced, i.e. \"tunnie\" (). In Australian English, the common and recommended pronunciation is . In the United States, \"metric ton\" is the name for this unit used and recommended by NIST; an unqualified mention of a \"ton\" typically refers to a short ton of 2,000 lb (907.2 kg) and to a lesser extent to a long ton of 2,240 lb (1,016 kg), with the term \"tonne\" rarely used in speech or writing. Both terms are acceptable in Canadian English.\n\"Ton\" and \"tonne\" are both derived from a Germanic word in general use in the North Sea area since the Middle Ages (cf. Old English and Old Frisian , Old High German and Medieval Latin , German and French ) to designate a large cask, or \"tun\". A full tun, standing about a metre high, could easily weigh a tonne. See also the common German word (lit.\u2009'garbage drum').\nThe spelling \"tonne\" pre-dates the introduction of the SI in 1960; it has been used with this meaning in France since 1842, when there were no metric prefixes for multiples of 106 and above, and is now used as the standard spelling for the metric mass measurement in most English-speaking countries. In the United States, the unit was originally referred to using the French words or , but these terms are now obsolete. The British imperial and United States customary units are comparable to the \"tonne\" and the spelling of \"ton\" in English is the same, though they differ in mass.\nFrench pre-metric tonne.\nPrior to metrification the French tonne consisted of 2000 French pounds (livres). Therefore a French tonne of that era weighed 979 kg compared to an English ton of 1016 kg. Prior to the use of tonne for this weight tonneau (plural: tonneaux) was used.\nConversions.\nOne tonne is equivalent to:\nA tonne is the mass of one cubic metre of pure water at .\nDerived units.\nAs a non-SI unit, the use of SI metric prefixes with the tonne does not fall within the SI standard. For multiples of the tonne, it is more usual to speak of thousands or millions of tonnes. Kilotonne, megatonne, and gigatonne are more usually used for the energy of nuclear explosions and other events in equivalent mass of TNT, often loosely as approximate figures. When used in this context, there is little need to distinguish between metric and other tons, and the unit is spelled either as \"ton\" or \"tonne\" with the relevant prefix attached.\nAlternative usages.\nMetric ton units.\nA metric ton unit (mtu) can mean within metal trading, particularly within the United States. It traditionally referred to a metric ton of ore containing 1% (i.e. 10\u00a0kg) of metal.\nThe following excerpt from a mining geology textbook describes its usage in the particular case of tungsten:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Tungsten concentrates are usually traded in metric tonne units (originally designating one tonne of ore containing 1% of WO3, today used to measure WO3 quantities in 10 kg units. One metric tonne unit (mtu) of tungsten (VI) contains 7.93 kilograms of tungsten.\u2014\u200a\nIn the case of uranium, \"MTU\" is sometimes used in the sense of \"metric ton of uranium\" ().\nUse of mass as proxy for energy.\nThe \"tonne of trinitrotoluene (TNT)\" is used as a proxy for energy, usually of explosions (TNT is a common high explosive). Prefixes are used: kiloton(ne), megaton(ne), gigaton(ne), especially for expressing nuclear weapon yield, based on a specific combustion energy of TNT of about 4.2\u00a0MJ/kg (or one thermochemical calorie per milligram). Hence, 1 t TNT = approx. 4.2\u00a0GJ, 1 kt TNT = approx. 4.2\u00a0TJ, 1\u00a0Mt TNT = approx. 4.2\u00a0PJ.\nThe SI unit of energy is the joule. One tonne of TNT is approximately equivalent to 4.2 gigajoules.\nIn the petroleum industry, the tonne of oil equivalent (toe) is a unit of energy: the amount of energy released by burning one tonne of crude oil, approximately 42\u00a0GJ. There are several slightly different definitions. This is ten times as much as a tonne of TNT because atmospheric oxygen is used.\nUnit of force.\nLike the gram and the kilogram, the tonne gave rise to a (now obsolete) force unit of the same name, the tonne-force, equivalent to about 9.8 kilonewtons. The unit is also often called simply \"tonne\" or \"metric ton\" without identifying it as a unit of force. In contrast to the tonne as a mass unit, the tonne-force is not accepted for use with SI.\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31187", "revid": "13286072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31187", "title": "TrueType", "text": "File format\nTrueType is an outline font standard developed by Apple in the late 1980s as a competitor to Adobe's Type 1 fonts used in PostScript. It has become the most common format for fonts on the classic Mac OS, macOS, and Microsoft Windows operating systems.\nThe primary strength of TrueType was originally that it offered font developers a high degree of control over precisely how their fonts are displayed, right down to particular pixels, at various font sizes. With widely varying rendering technologies in use today, pixel-level control is no longer certain in a TrueType font.\nHistory.\nDuring its development, TrueType was first known by the codename \"Bass\" and later by \"Royal\". The system was developed and eventually released as TrueType with the launch of Mac System 7 in May 1991. The initial TrueType outline fonts, four-weight families of \"Times Roman\", \"Helvetica\", \"Courier\", and the pi font \"Symbol\" replicated the original PostScript fonts of the Apple LaserWriter. Apple also replaced some of their bitmap fonts used by the graphical user-interface of previous Macintosh System versions (including Geneva, Monaco and New York) with scalable TrueType outline-fonts. For compatibility with older systems, Apple shipped these fonts, a TrueType Extension and a TrueType-aware version of Font/DA Mover for System 6. For compatibility with the Laserwriter II, Apple developed fonts like ITC Bookman and ITC Chancery in TrueType format.\nAll of these fonts could now scale to all sizes on screen and printer, making the Macintosh System 7 the first OS to work without any bitmap fonts. The early TrueType systems\u00a0\u2014 being still part of Apple's QuickDraw graphics subsystem\u00a0\u2014 did not render Type 1 fonts on-screen as they do today. At the time, many users had already invested considerable money in Adobe's still proprietary Type 1 fonts. As part of Apple's tactic of opening the font format versus Adobe's desire to keep it closed to all but Adobe licensees, Apple licensed TrueType to Microsoft. When TrueType and the license to Microsoft was announced, John Warnock, co-founder and then CEO of Adobe, gave an impassioned speech in which he claimed Apple and Microsoft were selling snake oil, and then announced that the Type 1 format was open for anyone to use.\nMeanwhile, in exchange for TrueType, Apple got a license for TrueImage, a PostScript-compatible page-description language owned by Microsoft that Apple could use in laser printing. This was never actually included in any Apple products when a later deal was struck between Apple and Adobe, where Adobe promised to put a TrueType interpreter in their PostScript printer boards. Apple renewed its agreements with Adobe for the use of PostScript in its printers, resulting in lower royalty payments to Adobe, who was beginning to license printer controllers capable of competing directly with Apple's LaserWriter printers.\nPart of Adobe's response to learning that TrueType was being developed was to create the Adobe Type Manager software to scale Type 1 fonts for anti-aliased output on-screen. Although ATM initially cost money, rather than coming free with the operating system, it became a \"de facto\" standard for anyone involved in desktop publishing. Anti-aliased rendering, combined with Adobe applications' ability to zoom in to read small type, and further combined with the now open PostScript Type 1 font format, provided the impetus for an explosion in font design and in desktop publishing of newspapers and magazines.\nApple extended TrueType with the launch of TrueType GX in 1994, with additional tables in the sfnt which formed part of QuickDraw GX. This offered powerful extensions in two main areas. First was font axes (today known as variations), for example allowing fonts to be smoothly adjusted from light to bold or from narrow to extended\u00a0\u2014 competition for Adobe's \"multiple master\" technology. Second was Line Layout Manager, where particular sequences of characters can be coded to flip to different designs in certain circumstances, useful for example to offer ligatures for \"fi\", \"ffi\", \"ct\", etc. while maintaining the backing store of characters necessary for spell checkers and text searching. However, the lack of user-friendly tools for making TrueType GX fonts meant there were no more than a handful of GX fonts.\nMuch of the technology in TrueType GX, including variations and substitution, lives on as AAT (Apple Advanced Typography) in macOS. Few font-developers outside Apple attempt to make AAT fonts; instead, OpenType has become the dominant sfnt format, and all of the font variation technology is the de facto standard today in OpenType Variations.\nAdoption by Microsoft.\nTo ensure its wide adoption, Apple licensed TrueType to Microsoft for free. Microsoft added TrueType into the Windows 3.1 operating environment. In partnership with their contractors, Monotype Imaging, Microsoft put a lot of effort into creating a set of high quality TrueType fonts that were compatible with the core fonts being bundled with PostScript equipment at the time. This included the fonts that are standard with Windows to this day: Times New Roman (compatible with Times Roman), Arial (compatible with Helvetica) and Courier New (compatible with Courier). In this context, \"compatible\" means two things. On an aesthetic level, it means that the fonts are similar in appearance. On a functional level, it means that the fonts have the same character widths. This allows documents which have been typeset in one font to be changed to the other, without reflow.\nMicrosoft and Monotype technicians used TrueType's hinting technology to ensure that these fonts did not suffer from the problem of illegibility at low resolutions, which had previously forced the use of bitmapped fonts for screen display. Subsequent advances in technology have introduced first anti-aliasing, which smooths the edges of fonts at the expense of a slight blurring, and more recently subpixel rendering (the Microsoft implementation goes by the name ClearType), which exploits the pixel structure of LCD based displays to increase the apparent resolution of text. Microsoft has heavily marketed ClearType, and sub-pixel rendering techniques for text are now widely used on all platforms.\nMicrosoft also developed a \"smart font\" technology, named \"TrueType Open\" in 1994, later renamed to OpenType in 1996 when it merged support of the Adobe Type 1 glyph outlines. Opentype now contains all of the same functionality of Apple TrueType and Apple TrueType GX.\nPlatform support.\nMacintosh and Microsoft Windows.\nTrueType has long been the most common format for fonts on classic Mac OS, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows, although Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows also include native support for Adobe's Type 1 format and the OpenType extension to TrueType (since Mac OS X 10.0 and Windows 2000). While some fonts provided with the new operating systems are now in the OpenType format, most free or inexpensive third-party fonts use plain TrueType.\nIncreasing resolutions and new approaches to screen rendering have reduced the requirement of extensive TrueType hinting. Apple's rendering approach on macOS ignores almost all the hints in a TrueType font, while Microsoft's ClearType ignores many hints, and according to Microsoft, works best with \"lightly hinted\" fonts.\nLinux and other platforms.\nThe FreeType project of David Turner has created an independent implementation of the TrueType standard (as well as other font standards in FreeType 2). FreeType is included in many Linux distributions.\nUntil May 2010, there were potential patent infringements in FreeType 1 because parts of the TrueType hinting virtual machine were patented by Apple, a fact not mentioned in the TrueType standards. (Patent holders who contribute to standards published by a major standards body such as ISO are required to disclose the scope of their patents, but TrueType was not such a standard.) FreeType 2 included an optional automatic hinter to avoid the patented technology, but these patents have now expired so FreeType 2.4 now enables these features by default.\nOutlines.\nThe outlines of the characters (or glyphs) in TrueType fonts are made of straight line segments and quadratic B\u00e9zier curves. These curves are mathematically simpler and faster to process than cubic B\u00e9zier curves, which are used both in the PostScript-centered world of graphic design and in Type 1 fonts. However, most shapes require more points to describe with quadratic curves than cubics. This difference also means that it is not possible to convert Type 1 losslessly to the TrueType format, although in practice it is often possible to do a lossless conversion from TrueType to Type 1.\nHinting language.\nTrueType systems include a virtual machine that executes programs inside the font, processing the \"hints\" of the glyphs, in TrueType called \u201cinstructions\u201d. These distort the control points which define the outline, with the intention that the rasterizer produce fewer undesirable features on the glyph. Each glyph's instruction set takes account of the size (in pixels) at which the glyph is to be displayed, as well as other less important factors of the display environment.\nAlthough incapable of receiving input and producing output as normally understood in programming, the TrueType instruction language does offer the other prerequisites of programming languages: conditional branching (IF statements), looping an arbitrary number of times (FOR- and WHILE-type statements), variables (although these are simply numbered slots in an area of memory reserved by the font), and encapsulation of code into functions. Special instructions called delta instructions are the lowest level control, moving a control point at just one pixel size.\nThe hallmark of effective TrueType glyph programming techniques is that it does as much as possible using variables defined just once in the whole font (e.g., stem widths, cap height, x-height). This means avoiding delta instructions as much as possible. This helps the font developer to make major changes (e.g., the point at which the entire font's main stems jump from 1 to 2 pixels wide) most of the way through development.\nCreating a very well-instructed TrueType font remains a significant amount of work, despite the increased user-friendliness of programs for adding instructions to fonts. Many TrueType fonts therefore have only rudimentary instructions, or have them automatically applied by the font editor, with results of various quality.\nEmbedding protection.\nThe TrueType format allows for the most basic type of digital rights management\u00a0\u2013 an \"embeddable flag field\" that specifies whether the author allows embedding of the font file into things like PDF files and websites. Anyone with access to the font file can directly modify this field, and simple tools exist to facilitate modifying it (obviously, modifying this field does not modify the font license and does not give extra legal rights). These tools have been the subject of controversy over potential copyright issues.\nEmoji.\nApple has implemented a proprietary extension to allow color .ttf files for its emoji font Apple Color Emoji.\nFile formats.\nBasic.\nA basic font is composed of multiple tables specified in its header. A table name can have up to 4 letters.\nA codice_1 extension indicates a regular TrueType font or an OpenType font with TrueType outlines. Windows end user defined character editor (EUDCEDIT.EXE) creates TrueType font with name EUDC.TTE. An OpenType font with PostScript outlines must have an .otf extension. In principle, an OpenType font with TrueType outlines may have an .otf extension, but this has rarely been done in practice.\nIn classic Mac OS and macOS, OpenType is one of several formats referred to as data-fork fonts, as they lack the classic Mac resource fork.\nCollection.\nTrueType Collection (TTC) is an extension of TrueType format that allows combining multiple fonts into a single file, creating substantial space savings for a collection of fonts with many glyphs in common. They were first available in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean versions of Windows, and supported for all regions in Windows 2000 and later. Classic Mac OS included support of TTC starting with Mac OS 8.5.\nA TrueType Collection file begins with a codice_2 table that allows access to the fonts within the collection by pointing to individual headers for each included font. The fonts within a collection share the same glyph-outline table, though each font can refer to subsets within those outlines in its own manner, through its codice_3, codice_4 and codice_5 tables. Collection files bear a codice_6 filename extension. In classic Mac OS and macOS, TTC has file type codice_2.\nSuitcase.\nThe suitcase format for TrueType is used on classic Mac OS and macOS. It adds additional Apple-specific information.\nLike TTC, it can handle multiple fonts within a single file. But unlike TTC, those fonts need not be within the same family.\nSuitcases come in resource-fork and data-fork formats. The resource-fork version was the original suitcase format. Data-fork-only suitcases, which place the resource fork contents into the data fork, were first supported in macOS. A suitcase packed into the data-fork-only format has the extension \"dfont\".\nPostScript.\nIn the PostScript language, TrueType outlines are handled with a PostScript wrapper as Type 42 for name-keyed or Type 11 for CID-keyed fonts.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It does not represent all marine species, just those that are readily fossilized. The labels of the traditional \"Big Five\" extinction events and the more recently recognised Capitanian mass extinction event are clickable links; see Extinction event for more details. \"()\"\nThe Triassic\u2013Jurassic (Tr-J) extinction event (TJME), often called the end-Triassic extinction, marks the boundary between the Triassic and Jurassic periods, https://\u00a0million years ago. It represents one of five major extinction events during the Phanerozoic, profoundly affecting life on land and in the oceans. \nIn the seas, about 23\u201334% of marine genera disappeared; corals, bivalves, brachiopods, bryozoans, and radiolarians suffered severe losses of diversity and conodonts were completely wiped out, while marine vertebrates, gastropods, and benthic foraminifera were relatively unaffected. On land, all archosauromorph reptiles other than crocodylomorphs, dinosaurs, and pterosaurs became extinct. Crocodylomorphs, dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and mammals were left largely untouched, allowing them to become the dominant land animals for the next 135 million years. Plants were likewise significantly affected by the crisis, with floral communities undergoing radical ecological restructuring across the extinction event.\nThe cause of the TJME is generally considered to have been extensive volcanic eruptions in the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP), a large igneous province whose emplacement released large amounts of carbon dioxide into the Earth's atmosphere, causing profound global warming and ocean acidification, and discharged immense quantities of toxic mercury into the environment. Older hypotheses have proposed that gradual changes in climate and sea levels may have been the cause, or perhaps one or more asteroid strikes.\nResearch history.\nThe earliest research on the TJME was conducted in the mid-20th century, when events in earth history were widely assumed to have been gradual, a paradigm known as uniformitarianism, while comparatively rapid cataclysms as causes of extinction events were dismissed as catastrophism, which had been associated with biblical creationism. Consequently, most researchers believed gradual environmental changes were the best explanation of the extinction; prominent vertebrate palaeontologist Edwin H. Colbert suggested gradual changes in the seasonality of rainfall and eustatic sea level rise that decreased the available land area above sea level were the culprit. In the 1980s, Jack Sepkoski identified the Triassic-Jurassic boundary drop in biodiversity as one of the \"Big 5\" mass extinction events. After the discovery that the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event was caused by an impact event, the TJME had also been suggested to have been caused by such an impact in the 1980s and 1990s. The theory that the TJME was caused by massive volcanism in the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) first emerged in the 1990s after similar research examining the Permian-Triassic extinction event found it to have been caused by volcanic activity and the emplacement of the CAMP was found to have occurred around the time of the Triassic-Jurassic transition. Despite some early objections, this paradigm remains the scientific consensus in the present day.\nEffects.\nMarine invertebrates.\nThe Triassic-Jurassic extinction completed the transition from the Palaeozoic evolutionary fauna to the Modern evolutionary fauna that continues to dominate the oceans in the present, a change that began in the aftermath of the end-Guadalupian extinction and continued following the Permian-Triassic extinction event (PTME). Between 23% and 34.1% of marine genera went extinct. Plankton diversity dropped suddenly, but it was relatively mildly impacted at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, although extinction rates among radiolarians rose significantly. Early Hettangian radiolarian communities became depauperate as a result of the TJME and consisted mainly of spumellarians and entactiniids. Benthic foraminifera suffered relatively minor losses of diversity. Some opportunistic foraminifera such as \"Triasina hantkeni\" increased in abundance as they thrived in oxygen-depleted waters. Ammonites were affected substantially by the Triassic-Jurassic extinction and were nearly wiped out. Ceratitidans, the most prominent group of ammonites in the Triassic, became extinct at the end of the Rhaetian after having their diversity reduced significantly in the Norian, while other ammonite groups such as the Ammonitina, Lytoceratina, and Phylloceratina diversified from the Early Jurassic onward. Bivalves suffered heavy losses, although the extinction was highly selective, with some bivalve clades escaping substantial diversity losses. The Lilliput effect, a term coined to describe a phenomenon wherein organisms shrink in size following a mass extinction, affected megalodontid bivalves, whereas file shell bivalves experienced the Brobdingnag effect, the reverse of the Lilliput effect. There is some evidence of a bivalve cosmopolitanism event during the mass extinction. Additionally, following the TJME, mobile bivalve taxa outnumbered stationary bivalve taxa. Gastropod diversity was barely affected at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, although gastropods gradually suffered numerous losses over the late Norian and Rhaetian, during the leadup to the TJME. Brachiopods declined in diversity at the end of the Triassic before rediversifying in the Sinemurian and Pliensbachian; the dielasmatoid, athyridoid, and spondylospiroid brachiopods experienced particularly severe declines. Bryozoans, particularly taxa that lived in offshore settings, had already been in decline since the Norian and suffered further losses in the TJME. Ostracods also suffered significant losses, although opportunistic ostracod forms thrived in the eutrophic conditions of the TJME. Conulariids seemingly completely died out at the end of the Triassic. Around 96% of coral genera died out, with integrated corals being especially devastated. Corals practically disappeared from the Tethys Ocean at the end of the Triassic except for its northernmost reaches, resulting in an early Hettangian \"coral gap\". There is good evidence for a collapse in the reef community, which was likely driven by ocean acidification resulting from CO2 supplied to the atmosphere by the CAMP eruptions.\nMost evidence points to a relatively fast recovery from the mass extinction. Benthic ecosystems recovered far more rapidly after the TJME than they did after the PTME. British Early Jurassic benthic marine environments display a relatively rapid recovery that began almost immediately after the end of the mass extinction despite numerous relapses into anoxic conditions during the earliest Jurassic. In the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin, recovery began in the late early Hettangian and lasted until a new biodiversity equilibrium in the late Hettangian. Also despite recurrent anoxic episodes, large bivalves began to reappear shortly after the extinction event. Siliceous sponges dominated the immediate aftermath interval thanks to the enormous influx of silica into the oceans, a consequence of the aerial extent of the CAMP basalts that were exposed to surficial weathering processes. In some regions, recovery was slow; in the northern Tethys, carbonate platforms in the TJME's aftermath became dominated by microbial carbonate producers and r-selected calcitic taxa such as \"Thaumatoporella parvovesiculifera\", while dasycladacean algae did not reappear until the Sinemurian stage.\nMarine vertebrates.\nFish did not suffer a mass extinction at the end of the Triassic. The Late Triassic in general did experience a gradual drop in actinopterygiian diversity after an evolutionary explosion in the Middle Triassic. Though this may have been due to falling sea levels or the Carnian Pluvial Event, it may instead be a result of sampling bias considering that Middle Triassic fish have been more extensively studied than Late Triassic fish. Despite the apparent drop in diversity, neopterygiians (which include most modern bony fish) suffered less than more \"primitive\" actinopterygiians, indicating a biological turnover where modern groups of fish started to supplant earlier groups. Pycnodontiform fish were insignificantly affected. Conodonts, which were prominent index fossils throughout the Paleozoic and Triassic, finally became extinct at the T-J boundary following declining diversity.\nLike fish, marine reptiles experienced a substantial drop in diversity between the Middle Triassic and the Jurassic. However, their extinction rate at the Triassic\u2013Jurassic boundary was not elevated. The highest extinction rates experienced by Mesozoic marine reptiles actually occurred at the end of the Ladinian stage, which corresponds to the end of the Middle Triassic. The only marine reptile families which became extinct at or slightly before the Triassic\u2013Jurassic boundary were the placochelyids (the last family of placodonts), making plesiosaurs the only surviving sauropterygians, and giant ichthyosaurs such as shastasaurids. Some authors have argued that the end of the Triassic acted as a genetic \"bottleneck\" for ichthyosaurs, which never regained the level of anatomical diversity and disparity which they possessed during the Triassic, although analysis of ichthyosaurian and eosauropterygian disparity across the Triassic-Jurassic transition has shown no evidence for such a bottleneck. The high diversity of rhomaelosaurids immediately after the TJME points to a gradual extinction of marine reptiles rather than an abrupt one.\nTerrestrial animals.\nTerrestrial fauna was affected by the TJME much more severely than marine fauna. One of the earliest pieces of evidence for a Late Triassic extinction was a major turnover in terrestrial tetrapods such as amphibians, reptiles, and synapsids. Edwin H. Colbert drew parallels between the system of extinction and adaptation between the Triassic\u2013Jurassic and Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundaries. He recognized how dinosaurs, lepidosaurs (lizards and their relatives), and crocodyliforms (crocodilians and their relatives) filled the niches of more ancient groups of amphibians and reptiles which were extinct by the start of the Jurassic. Olsen (1987) estimated that 42% of all terrestrial tetrapods became extinct at the end of the Triassic, based on his studies of faunal changes in the Newark Supergroup of eastern North America. In contrast to the end-Cretaceous extinction, the TJME substantially affected freshwater ecosystems, and it further differed from the former in that body size did not affect extinction risk. More modern studies have debated whether the turnover in Triassic tetrapods was abrupt at the end of the Triassic, or instead more gradual.\nDuring the Triassic, amphibians were mainly represented by large, crocodile-like members of the order Temnospondyli. Although the earliest lissamphibians (modern amphibians like frogs and salamanders) did appear during the Triassic, they would become more common in the Jurassic while the temnospondyls diminished in diversity past the Triassic\u2013Jurassic boundary. Although the decline of temnospondyls did send shockwaves through freshwater ecosystems, it was probably not as abrupt as some authors have suggested. Brachyopoids, for example, survived until the Cretaceous according to new discoveries in the 1990s. Several temnospondyl groups did become extinct near the end of the Triassic despite earlier abundance, but it is uncertain how close their extinctions were to the end of the Triassic. The last known metoposaurids (\"Apachesaurus\") were from the Redonda Formation, which may have been early Rhaetian or late Norian. \"Gerrothorax\", the last known plagiosaurid, has been found in rocks which are probably (but not certainly) Rhaetian, while a capitosaur humerus was found in Rhaetian-age deposits in 2018. Therefore, plagiosaurids and capitosaurs were likely victims of an extinction at the very end of the Triassic, while most other temnospondyls were already extinct.\nTerrestrial reptile faunas were dominated by archosauromorphs during the Triassic, particularly phytosaurs and members of Pseudosuchia (the reptile lineage which leads to modern crocodilians). In the Early Jurassic and onwards, dinosaurs and pterosaurs became the most common land reptiles, while small reptiles were mostly represented by lepidosauromorphs (such as lizards and tuatara relatives). Among pseudosuchians, only small crocodylomorphs did not become extinct by the end of the Triassic, with both dominant herbivorous subgroups (such as aetosaurs) and carnivorous ones (rauisuchids) having died out. Phytosaurs, drepanosaurs, trilophosaurids, tanystropheids, and procolophonids, which were other common reptiles in the Late Triassic, had also become extinct by the start of the Jurassic. However, pinpointing the extinction of these different land reptile groups is difficult, as the last stage of the Triassic, the Rhaetian, and the first stage of the Jurassic, the Hettangian, each have few records of large land animals; some paleontologists have considered only phytosaurs and procolophonids to have become extinct at the Triassic\u2013Jurassic boundary, with other groups having become extinct earlier. However, it is likely that many other groups survived up until the boundary according to British fissure deposits from the Rhaetian. Aetosaurs, kuehneosaurids, drepanosaurs, thecodontosaurids, \"saltoposuchids\" (like \"Terrestrisuchus\"), trilophosaurids, and various non-crocodylomorph pseudosuchians are all examples of Rhaetian reptiles which may have become extinct at the Triassic\u2013Jurassic boundary.\nIn the TJME's aftermath, dinosaurs experienced a major radiation, filling some of the niches vacated by the victims of the extinction. Crocodylomorphs likewise underwent a very rapid and major adaptive radiation. Surviving non-mammalian synapsid clades similarly played a role in the post-TJME adaptive radiation during the Early Jurassic.\nHerbivorous insects were minimally affected by the TJME; evidence from the Sichuan Basin shows they were overall able to quickly adapt to the floristic turnover by exploiting newly abundant plants. Odonates suffered highly selective losses, and their morphospace was heavily restructured as a result.\nTerrestrial plants.\nThe extinction event marks a floral turnover as well, with estimates of the percentage of Rhaetian pre-extinction plants being lost ranging from 17% to 73%. Though spore turnovers are observed across the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, the abruptness of this transition and the relative abundances of given spore types both before and after the boundary are highly variable from one region to another, pointing to a global ecological restructuring rather than a mass extinction of plants. Overall, plants suffered minor diversity losses on a global scale as a result of the extinction, but species turnover rates were high and substantial changes occurred in terms of relative abundance and growth distribution among taxa. Evidence from Central Europe suggests that rather than a sharp, very rapid decline followed by an adaptive radiation, a more gradual turnover in both fossil plants and spores with several intermediate stages is observed over the course of the extinction event. Extinction of plant species can in part be explained by the suspected increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as a result of CAMP volcanic activity, which would have created photoinhibition and decreased transpiration levels among species with low photosynthetic plasticity, such as the broad leaved Ginkgoales which declined to near extinction across the Tr\u2013J boundary.\nFerns and other species with dissected leaves displayed greater adaptability to atmosphere conditions of the extinction event, and in some instances were able to proliferate across the boundary and into the Jurassic. The species \"Lepidopteris ottonis\" evolved a reliance on asexual reproduction amidst the environmental chaos of the TJME. In the Jiyuan Basin of North China, \"Classopolis\" content increased drastically in concordance with warming, drying, wildfire activity, enrichments in isotopically light carbon, and an overall reduction in floral diversity. In the Sichuan Basin, relatively cool mixed forests in the late Rhaetian were replaced by hot, arid fernlands during the Triassic\u2013Jurassic transition, which in turn later gave way to a cheirolepid-dominated flora in the Hettangian and Sinemurian. The abundance of ferns in China that were resistant to high levels of aridity increased significantly across the Triassic\u2013Jurassic boundary, though ferns better adapted for moist, humid environments declined, indicating that plants experienced major environmental stress, albeit not an outright mass extinction. In some regions, however, major floral extinctions did occur, with some researchers challenging the hypothesis of there being no significant floral mass extinction on this basis. Evidence from Jameson Land in East Greenland indicates that more than half of plant genera perished in the TJME. In the Newark Supergroup of the United States East Coast, about 60% of the diverse monosaccate and bisaccate pollen assemblages disappear at the Tr\u2013J boundary, indicating a major extinction of plant genera. Early Jurassic pollen assemblages are dominated by \"Corollina\", a new genus that took advantage of the empty niches left by the extinction. The site of St. Audrie's Bay displays a shift from diverse gymnosperm-dominated forests to Cheirolepidiaceae-dominated monocultures. The Danish Basin saw 34% of its Rhaetian spore-pollen assemblage, including \"Cingulizonates rhaeticus\", \"Limbosporites lundbladiae\", \"Polypodiisporites polymicroforatus\", and \"Ricciisporites tuberculatus\", disappear, with the post-extinction plant community being dominated by pinacean conifers such as \"Pinuspollenites minimus\" and tree ferns such as \"Deltoidospora\", with ginkgos, cycads, cypresses, and corystospermous seed ferns also represented. Along the margins of the European Epicontinental Sea and the European shores of the Tethys, coastal and near-coastal mires fell victim to an abrupt sea level rise. These mires were replaced by a pioneering opportunistic flora after an abrupt sea level fall, although its heyday was short lived and it died out shortly after its rise. The opportunists that established themselves along the Tethyan coastline were primarily spore-producers. In the Eiberg Basin of the Northern Calcareous Alps, there was a very rapid palynomorph turnover. The palynological and palaeobotanical succession in Queensland shows a \"Classopolis\" bloom after the TJME. Polyploidy may have been an important factor that mitigated a conifer species' risk of going extinct.\nPossible causes.\nCentral Atlantic Magmatic Province.\nThe leading and best evidenced explanation for the TJME is massive volcanic eruptions, specifically from the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP), the largest known large igneous province by area, and one of the most voluminous, with its flood basalts extending across parts of southwestern Europe, northwestern Africa, northeastern South America, and southeastern North America. The coincidence and synchrony of CAMP activity and the TJME is indicated by uranium\u2013lead dating, argon-argon dating, and palaeomagnetism. The isotopic composition of fossil soils and marine sediments near the boundary between the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic has been tied to a large negative \u03b413C excursion, with values as low as -2.8%. Carbon isotopes of hydrocarbons (\"n\"-alkanes) derived from leaf wax and lignin, and total organic carbon from two sections of lake sediments interbedded with the CAMP in eastern North America have shown carbon isotope excursions similar to those found in the mostly marine St. Audrie's Bay section, Somerset, England; the correlation suggests that the TJME began at the same time in marine and terrestrial environments, slightly before the oldest basalts in eastern North America but simultaneous with the eruption of the oldest flows in Morocco, with both a critical CO2 greenhouse and a marine biocalcification crisis. Furthermore, chemostratigraphic analysis in the Junggar Basin has shown that the negative \u03b413C excursions associated with CAMP volcanism corresponded in time to biotic turnovers in the palynomorph record, strongly suggesting a causal relationship between the two. Contemporaneous CAMP eruptions, mass extinction, and the carbon isotopic excursions are shown in the same places, making the case for a volcanic cause of a mass extinction. The observed negative carbon isotope excursion is lower in some sites that correspond to what was then eastern Panthalassa because of the extreme aridity of western Pangaea limiting weathering and erosion there. The negative \u03b413C excursion associated with CAMP volcanism lasted for approximately 20,000 to 40,000 years, or about one or two of Earth's axial precession cycles, although the carbon cycle was so disrupted that it did not stabilise until the Sinemurian. Mercury anomalies from deposits in various parts of the world have further bolstered the volcanic cause hypothesis, as have anomalies from various platinum-group elements. Nickel enrichments are also observed at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary coevally with light carbon enrichments, providing yet more evidence of massive volcanism.\nSome scientists initially rejected the volcanic eruption theory because the Newark Supergroup, a section of rock in eastern North America that records the Triassic\u2013Jurassic boundary, contains no ash-fall horizons and because its oldest basalt flows were estimated to lie around 10\u00a0m above the transition zone, which they estimated to have occurred 610 kyr after the TJME. Also among their objections was that the Triassic-Jurassic boundary was poorly defined and the CAMP eruptions poorly constrained temporally. However, updated dating protocol and wider sampling has confirmed that the CAMP eruptions started in Morocco only a few thousand years before the extinction, preceding their onset in Nova Scotia and New Jersey, and that they continued in several more pulses for the next 600,000 years. Volcanic global warming has also been criticised as an explanation because some estimates have found that the amount of carbon dioxide emitted was only around 250 ppm, not enough to generate a mass extinction. In addition, at some sites, changes in carbon isotope ratios have been attributed to diagenesis and not any primary environmental changes.\nGlobal warming.\nThe flood basalts of the CAMP released gigantic quantities of carbon dioxide, a potent greenhouse gas causing intense global warming. Before the TJME, carbon dioxide levels were around 1,000 ppm as measured by the stomatal index of \"Lepidopteris ottonis\", but this quantity jumped to 1,300 ppm at the onset of the extinction event. During the TJME, carbon dioxide concentrations increased fourfold. The record of CAMP degassing shows several distinct pulses of carbon dioxide immediately following each major pulse of magmatism, at least two of which amount to a doubling of atmospheric CO2. Carbon dioxide was emitted quickly and in enormous quantities compared to other periods of Earth's history, rate of carbon dioxide emissions was one of the most meteoric rises in carbon dioxide levels in Earth's entire history. It is estimated that a single volcanic pulse from the large igneous province would have emitted an amount of carbon dioxide roughly equivalent to projected anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions for the 21st century. In addition, the flood basalts intruded through sediments that were rich in organic matter and combusted it, as evidenced by low \u0394199Hg values showing elevated levels of organic matter-derived mercury in the environment. The degassing of volatiles resulting from volcanic intrusions into organic-rich sediments further enhanced the volcanic warming of the climate. Thermogenic carbon release through such contact metamorphism of carbon-rich deposits has been found to be a sensible hypothesis providing a coherent explanation for the magnitude of the negative carbon isotope excursions at the terminus of the Triassic. Global temperatures rose sharply by 3 to 4\u00a0\u00b0C. In some regions, the temperature rise was as great as 10 \u00b0C. Kaolinite-dominated clay mineral spectra reflect the extremely hot and humid greenhouse conditions engendered by the CAMP. Soil erosion occurred as the hydrological cycle was accelerated by the extreme global heat.\nThe catastrophic dissociation of gas hydrates as a positive feedback resulting from warming, which has been suggested as one possible cause of the PTME, the largest mass extinction of all time, may have exacerbated greenhouse conditions, although others suggest that methane hydrate release was temporally mismatched with the TJME and thus not a cause of it.\nGlobal cooling.\nBesides the carbon dioxide-driven long-term global warming, CAMP volcanism had shorter term cooling effects resulting from the emission of sulphur dioxide aerosols. The extremely voluminous emission of this gas caused sharp drops in Earth's albedo and induced severe volcanic winters. High latitudes had colder climates with evidence of mild glaciation during the extinction interval. Cold periods induced by volcanic ejecta clouding the atmosphere might have favoured endothermic animals, with dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and mammals being more capable at enduring these conditions than large pseudosuchians due to insulation. \nMetal poisoning.\nCAMP volcanism released enormous amounts of toxic mercury. The appearance of high rates of mutagenesis of varying severity in fossil spores during the TJME coincides with mercury anomalies and is thus believed by researchers to have been caused by mercury poisoning. \u03b4202Hg and \u0394199Hg evidence suggests that volcanism caused the mercury loading directly at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, but that there were later bouts of elevated mercury in the environment during the Early Jurassic caused by eccentricity-forced enhancement of hydrological cycling and erosion that resulted in remobilisation of volcanically injected mercury that had been deposited in wetlands.\nWildfires.\nThe intense, rapid warming is believed to have resulted in increased storminess and lightning activity as a consequence of the more humid climate. The uptick in lightning activity is in turn implicated as a cause of an increase in wildfire activity. The combined presence of charcoal fragments and heightened levels of pyrolytic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Polish sedimentary facies straddling the Triassic-Jurassic boundary indicates wildfires were extremely commonplace during the earliest Jurassic, immediately after the Triassic-Jurassic transition. Elevated wildfire activity is also known from the Junggar Basin. In the Jiyuan Basin, two distinct pulses of drastically elevated wildfire activity are known: the first mainly affected canopies and occurred amidst relatively humid conditions while the second predominantly affected ground cover and was associated with aridity. At the Winterswijk quarry in the Netherlands, a surge in wildfire activity has been suggested to correspond to and have caused the sudden decline in coniferous vegetation. Frequent wildfires, combined with increased seismic activity from CAMP emplacement, led to apocalyptic soil degradation.\nAnoxia and euxinia.\nAnoxia was another mechanism of extinction; the end-Triassic extinction was coeval with an uptick in black shale deposition and a pronounced negative \u03b4238U excursion, indicating a major decrease in marine oxygen availability. Additional evidence for anoxia during the TJME comes from pyrite framboids, which grow in anoxic conditions. Evidence of anoxia has been discovered at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary across the world's oceans; the western Tethys, eastern Tethys, and Panthalassa were all affected by a precipitous drop in seawater oxygen, although at a few sites, the TJME was associated with fully oxygenated waters. Positive \u03b415N excursions have also been interpreted as evidence of anoxia concomitant with increased denitrification in marine sediments in the TJME's aftermath.\nIn northeastern Panthalassa, episodes of anoxia were already occurring during the Rhaetian before the TJME, making its marine ecosystems unstable even before the main crisis began. This early phase of environmental degradation in eastern Panthalassa may have been caused by an early phase of CAMP activity. Anoxic, reducing conditions were likewise present in western Panthalassa off the coast of what is now Japan for about a million years prior to the TJME. During the TJME, the rapid warming led to the stagnation of ocean circulation in many ocean regions, enabling the development of catastrophic anoxia; in what is now northwestern Europe, shallow seas became salinity stratified, enabling easy development of anoxia. Another factor contributing to anoxia was the increase in continental weathering driven by intense warming that delivered vast quantities of nutrients to the ocean surface and engendered eutrophication; this uptick in weathering is evidenced by positive \u03b456Fe excursions. A combination of negative \u03b466Zn excursions, positive \u03b426Mg excursions, and a lack of significant change in \u03b465Cu provides further evidence of increased chemical weathering resulting from increased temperature and humidity on land at high latitudes. Increased influx of terrestrial organic matter, in conjunction with reduced salinity, has been directly shown to have enkindled anoxia in the Eiberg Basin. Persistent low \u03b4238U ratios indicate prolonged global oxygen depletion continued into the Hettangian, with 87Sr/86Sr values showing that high influxes of terrestrial nutrients likely continued to eutrophicate the oceans well after the Triassic-Jurassic boundary. The persistence of anoxia into the Hettangian age may have helped delay the recovery of marine life in the extinction's aftermath.\nEuxinia, a form of anoxia defined by not just the absence of dissolved oxygen but high concentrations of hydrogen sulphide, also developed in the oceans, as indicated by findings of increased isorenieratane. The increase in concentration of this substance reveals that populations of green sulphur bacteria, which photosynthesise using hydrogen sulphide instead of water, grew significantly across the Triassic-Jurassic boundary. A meteoric shift towards positive sulphur isotope ratios in reduced sulphur species indicates a complete utilisation of sulphate by sulphate reducing bacteria. Off the shores of the Wrangellia Terrane, the onset of photic zone euxinia was preceded by an interval of limited nitrogen availability and increased nitrogen fixation in surface waters while euxinia developed in bottom waters. Recurrent hydrogen sulphide poisoning following the TJME had retarding effects on biotic rediversification.\nOcean acidification.\nOceanic uptake of volcanogenic carbon and sulphur dioxide would have led to a significant decrease of seawater pH known as ocean acidification, which is discussed as a relevant driver of marine extinction, acting in conjunction with marine anoxia. Additionally, acidification was enhanced and exacerbated by widespread photic zone euxinia, which caused increased rates of organic matter respiration and carbon dioxide release. Direct evidence of ocean acidification in the former of \u03b411B ratios in fossil oysters is known from the TJME interval. Further evidence for ocean acidification as an extinction mechanism comes from the preferential extinction of marine organisms with thick aragonitic skeletons and little biotic control of biocalcification (e.g., corals, hypercalcifying sponges), which resulted in a coral reef collapse and an early Hettangian \"coral gap\". The decline of megalodontoid bivalves is also attributed to increased seawater acidity. Extensive fossil remains of malformed calcareous nannoplankton, a common sign of significant drops in pH, have also been extensively reported from the Triassic-Jurassic boundary. Global interruption of carbonate deposition at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary has been cited as additional evidence for catastrophic ocean acidification. Upwardly developing aragonite fans in the shallow subseafloor may also reflect decreased pH, these structures being speculated to have precipitated concomitantly with acidification. In some studied sections, the TJME biocalcification crisis is masked by emersion of carbonate platforms induced by marine regression.\nOzone depletion.\nResearch on the role of ozone shield deterioration during the Permian-Triassic mass extinction has suggested that it may have been a factor in the TJME as well. A spike in the abundance of unseparated tetrads of \"Kraeuselisporites reissingerii\" has been interpreted as evidence of increased ultraviolet radiation flux resulting from ozone layer damage caused by volcanic aerosols.\nGradual climate change.\nThe extinctions at the end of the Triassic were initially attributed to gradually changing environments. Within his 1958 study recognizing biological turnover between the Triassic and Jurassic, Edwin H. Colbert's proposal was that this extinction was a result of geological processes decreasing the diversity of land biomes. He considered the Triassic period to be an era of the world experiencing a variety of environments, from towering highlands to arid deserts to tropical marshes. In contrast, the Jurassic period was much more uniform both in climate and elevation due to excursions by shallow seas.\nLater studies noted a clear trend towards increased aridification towards the end of the Triassic. Although high-latitude areas like Greenland and Australia actually became wetter, most of the world experienced more drastic changes in climate as indicated by geological evidence. This evidence includes an increase in carbonate and evaporite deposits (which are most abundant in dry climates) and a decrease in coal deposits (which primarily form in humid environments such as coal forests). In addition, the climate may have become much more seasonal, with long droughts interrupted by severe monsoons. The world gradually got warmer over this time as well; from the late Norian to the Rhaetian, mean annual temperatures rose by 7 to 9\u00a0\u00b0C. The site of Hochalm in Austria preserves evidence of carbon cycle perturbations during the Rhaetian preceding the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, potentially having a role in the ecological crisis.\nSea level fall.\nGeological formations in Europe and the Middle East seem to indicate a drop in sea levels at the end of the Triassic associated with the TJME. Although falling sea levels have sometimes been considered a culprit for marine extinctions, evidence is inconclusive since many sea level drops in geological history are not correlated with increased extinctions. However, there is still some evidence that marine life was affected by secondary processes related to falling sea levels, such as decreased oxygenation (caused by sluggish circulation), or increased acidification. These processes do not seem to have been worldwide, with the sea level fall observed in European sediments believed to be not global but regional, and with even some European sections showing no sign of sea level fall across the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, but they may explain local extinctions in European marine fauna. However, it is not universally accepted that even this local diversity drop was caused by sea level fall. A pronounced sea level change in latest Triassic records from Lake Williston in northeastern British Columbia, which was then the northeastern margin of Panthalassa, resulted in an extinction event of infaunal (sediment-dwelling) bivalves, though not epifaunal ones.\nExtraterrestrial impact.\nSome have hypothesized that an impact from an asteroid or comet caused the Triassic\u2013Jurassic extinction, similar to the extraterrestrial object which was the main factor in the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction about 66 million years ago, as evidenced by the Chicxulub crater in Mexico. However, so far no impact crater of sufficient size has been dated to precisely coincide with the Triassic\u2013Jurassic boundary.\nNevertheless, the Late Triassic did experience several impacts, including the second-largest confirmed impact in the Mesozoic. The Manicouagan Reservoir in Quebec is one of the most visible large impact craters on Earth, and at in diameter it is tied with the Eocene Popigai impact structure in Siberia as the fourth-largest impact crater on Earth. Olsen \"et al.\" (1987) were the first scientists to link the Manicouagan crater to the Triassic\u2013Jurassic extinction, citing its age which at the time was roughly considered to be Late Triassic. More precise radiometric dating by Hodych &amp; Dunning (1992) has shown that the Manicouagan impact occurred about 214 million years ago, about 13 million years before the Triassic\u2013Jurassic boundary. Therefore, it could not have been responsible for an extinction precisely at the Triassic\u2013Jurassic boundary. Nevertheless, the Manicouagan impact did have a widespread effect on the planet; a 214-million-year-old ejecta blanket of shocked quartz has been found in rock layers as far away as England and Japan. There is still a possibility that the Manicouagan impact was responsible for a small extinction midway through the Late Triassic at the Carnian\u2013Norian boundary, although the disputed age of this boundary (and whether an extinction actually occurred in the first place) makes it difficult to correlate the impact with extinction. Onoue \"et al.\" (2016) alternatively proposed that the Manicouagan impact was responsible for a marine extinction in the middle of the Norian which affected radiolarians, sponges, conodonts, and Triassic ammonoids. Thus, the Manicouagan impact may have been partially responsible for the gradual decline in the latter two groups which culminated in their extinction at the Triassic\u2013Jurassic boundary. The boundary between the Adamanian and Revueltian land vertebrate faunal zones, which involved extinctions and faunal changes in tetrapods and plants, was possibly also caused by the Manicouagan impact, although discrepancies between magnetochronological and isotopic dating lead to some uncertainty.\nOther Triassic craters are closer to the Triassic\u2013Jurassic boundary but also much smaller than the Manicouagan reservoir. The eroded Rochechouart impact structure in France has most recently been dated to million years ago, but at across (possibly up to across originally), it appears to be too small to have affected the ecosystem, although it has been speculated to have played a role in an alleged much smaller extinction event at the Norian-Rhaetian boundary. The wide Saint Martin crater in Manitoba has been proposed as a candidate for a possible TJME-causing impact, but its has since been dated to be Carnian. Other putative or confirmed Triassic craters include the wide Puchezh-Katunki crater in Eastern Russia (though it may be Jurassic in age), the wide Obolon' crater in Ukraine, and the wide Red Wing Creek structure in North Dakota. Spray \"et al.\" (1998) noted an interesting phenomenon, that being how the Manicouagan, Rochechouart, and Saint Martin craters all seem to be at the same latitude, and that the Obolon' and Red Wing craters form parallel arcs with the Rochechouart and Saint Martin craters, respectively. Spray and his colleagues hypothesized that the Triassic experienced a \"multiple impact event\", a large fragmented asteroid or comet which broke up and impacted the earth in several places at the same time. Such an impact has been observed in the present day, when Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 broke up and hit Jupiter in 1992. However, the \"multiple impact event\" hypothesis for Triassic impact craters has not been well-supported; Kent (1998) noted that the Manicouagan and Rochechouart craters were formed in eras of different magnetic polarity, and radiometric dating of the individual craters has shown that the impacts occurred millions of years apart.\nShocked quartz has been found in Rhaetian deposits from the Northern Apennines of Italy, providing possible evidence of an end-Triassic extraterrestrial impact. Certain trace metals indicative of a bolide impact have been found in the late Rhaetian, though not at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary itself; the discoverers of these trace metal anomalies purport that such a bolide impact could only have been an indirect cause of the TJME. The discovery of seismites two to four metres thick coeval with the carbon isotope fluctuations associated with the TJME has been interpreted as evidence of a possible bolide impact, although no definitive link between these seismites and any impact event has been found.\nOn the other hand, the dissimilarity between the isotopic perturbations characterising the TJME and those characterising the end-Cretaceous mass extinction makes an extraterrestrial impact highly unlikely to have been the cause of the TJME, according to many researchers. Various trace metal ratios, including palladium/iridium, platinum/iridium, and platinum/rhodium, in rocks deposited during the TJME have numerical values very different from what would be expected in an extraterrestrial impact scenario, providing further evidence against this hypothesis. The Triassic-Jurassic boundary furthermore lacks a fern spore spike akin to that observed at the terminus of the Cretaceous, inconsistent with an asteroid impact.\nComparisons to present climate change.\nThe extremely rapid, centuries-long timescale of carbon emissions and global warming caused by pulses of CAMP volcanism has drawn comparisons between the Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction and anthropogenic global warming, currently causing the Holocene extinction. The current rate of carbon dioxide emissions is around 50 gigatonnes per year, hundreds of times faster than during the latest Triassic, although the lack of extremely detailed stratigraphic resolution and pulsed nature of CAMP volcanism means that individual pulses of greenhouse gas emissions likely occurred on comparable timescales to human release of warming gases since the Industrial Revolution. The degassing rate of the first pulse of CAMP volcanism is estimated to have been around half of the rate of modern anthropogenic emissions. Palaeontologists studying the TJME and its impacts warn that a major reduction in humanity's carbon dioxide emissions to slow down climate change is of critical importance for preventing a catastrophe similar to the TJME from befalling the modern biosphere. If human-induced climate change persists as is, predictions can be made as to how various aspects of the biosphere will respond based on records of the TJME. For example, current conditions such the increased carbon dioxide levels, ocean acidification, and ocean deoxygenation create a similar climate to that of the Triassic-Jurassic boundary for marine life, so it is the common assumption that should the trends continue, modern reef-building taxa and skeletal benthic organisms will be preferentially impacted. The end-Triassic reef crisis has been specifically cited as a possible analogue for the fate of present coral reefs should anthropogenic global warming continue.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Birds from the western Pacific population are somewhat larger than those from the eastern Pacific, and male birds tend to be slightly larger than females.\nThey are primarily black with a white facial patch, and, typical of other puffin species, feature a very thick bill, primarily red with some yellow and occasionally green markings. Their most distinctive feature and namesake are the yellow tufts () that appear annually on birds of both sexes as the summer reproductive season approaches. Their feet become bright red and their face is also bright white in the summer. During the feeding season, the tufts molt off and the plumage, beak, and legs lose much of their luster.\nAs among other alcids, the wings are relatively short, adapted for diving, underwater swimming, and capturing prey rather than gliding, of which they are incapable. As a consequence, they have thick, dark myoglobin-rich breast muscles adapted for a fast and aerobically strenuous wing-beat cadence, which they can nonetheless maintain for long periods of time.\nJuvenile tufted puffins resemble winter adults, but with a grey-brown breast shading to white on the belly, and a shallow, yellowish-brown bill. Overall, they resemble a horn-less and unmarked rhinoceros auklet (\"Cerorhinca monocerata\").\nTaxonomy.\nThe tufted puffin was first described in 1769 by German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas. The scientific name \"Fratercula\" comes from the Medieval Latin , friar, a reference to the black and white plumage which resembles monastic robes. The specific name \"cirrhata\" is Latin for \"curly-headed\", from \"cirrus\", a curl of hair. The vernacular name \"puffin\" \u2013 puffed in the sense of swollen \u2013 was originally applied to the fatty, salted meat of young birds of the unrelated species, the Manx shearwater (\"Puffinus puffinus\"), formerly known as the \"Manks puffin\". It is an Anglo-Norman word (Middle English \"pophyn\" or \"poffin\") used for the cured carcasses. The Atlantic puffin acquired the name at a much later stage, possibly because of its similar nesting habits, and it was formally applied to that species by Pennant in 1768. It was later extended to include the similar and related Pacific puffins.\nSince it may be more closely related to the rhinoceros auklet than the other puffins, it is sometimes placed in the monotypic genus Lunda.\nThe juveniles, due to their similarity to \"C. monocerata\", were initially mistaken for a distinct species of a monotypic genus, and named Sagmatorrhina lathami (\"Latham's saddle-billed auk\", from \"sagmata\" \"saddle\" and \"rhina\" \"nose\").\nDistribution and habitat.\nTufted puffins form dense breeding colonies during the summer reproductive season from Washington state and British Columbia, throughout southeastern Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, Kamchatka, the Kuril Islands and throughout the Sea of Okhotsk. While they share some habitat with horned puffins (\"F. corniculata\"), the range of the tufted puffin is generally more eastern. They have been known to nest in small numbers as far south as the northern Channel Islands, off the coast of southern California. However, the last confirmed sighting at the Channel Islands occurred in 1997.\nTufted puffins typically select islands or cliffs that are relatively inaccessible to predators, close to productive waters, and high enough that they can take to the air successfully. Ideal habitat is steep but with a relatively soft soil substrate and grass for the creation of burrows.\nDuring the winter feeding season, they spend their time almost exclusively at sea, extending their range throughout the North Pacific and south to Japan and California.\nBehavior.\nBreeding.\nBreeding takes place on isolated islands: over 25,000 pairs have been recorded in a single colony off the coast of British Columbia. The nest is usually a simple burrow dug with the bill and feet, but sometimes a crevice between rocks is used instead. It is well-lined with vegetation and feathers. Courtship occurs through skypointing, strutting, and billing. A single egg is laid, usually in June, and incubated by both parents for about 45 days. The eggs are pure white or pale buff and are without gloss. They very often have barely perceptible shell markings of dull purplish color. Fledglings leave the nest at between 40 and 55 days.\nTufted puffins may be purely aquatic locomotive animals until they are three, living entirely as marine animals returning to shore only to breed on the nesting cliffs where they hatched. They tend to be well offshore when hatching.\nDiet.\nTufted puffins feed on a variety of fish and marine invertebrates, which they catch by diving from the surface. However, their diet varies greatly with age and location. Adult puffins largely depend on invertebrates, especially squid and krill. Nestlings at coastal colonies are fed primarily fish such as rockfish and sandlance, while nestlings at colonies closer to pelagic habitats are more dependent on invertebrates. Demersal fish are consumed in some quantity by most nestlings, suggesting that puffins feed to some extent on the ocean bottom.\nFeeding areas can be located far offshore from the nesting areas. Puffins can store large quantities of small fish in their bills and carry them to their chicks.\nPredators and threats.\nTufted puffins are preyed upon by various avian raptors such as snowy owls, bald eagles and peregrine falcons, and mammals like the Arctic fox. Foxes seem to prefer the puffin over other birds, making the bird a main target. Choosing inaccessible cliffs and entirely mammal-free islands protects them from terrestrial predators while laying eggs in burrows is effective in protecting them from egg-scavengers like gulls and ravens.\nA mass die-off of puffins at St. Paul Island, Alaska between October 2016 and January 2017 has been attributed to ecosystem changes resulting from climate change.\nRelationship with humans.\nThe Aleut and Ainu people (who called them \"Etupirka\") of the North Pacific traditionally hunted tufted puffin for food and feathers. Skins were used to make tough parkas worn feather side in and the silky tufts were sewn into ornamental work. Currently, harvesting of tufted puffin is illegal or discouraged throughout its range.\nThe tufted puffin is a familiar bird on the coasts of the Russian Pacific coast, where it is known as \"toporok\" () \u2013 meaning \"small axe,\" a hint to the shape of the bill. \"Toporok\" is the namesake of one of its main breeding sites, \"Kamen Toporkov\" (\"Tufted Puffin Rock\") or \"Ostrov Toporkov\" (\"Tufted Puffin Island\"), an islet offshore Bering Island.\nThe oldest recorded tufted puffin was six years old when discovered in Alaska, the same state where it had been banded.\nConservation status in Puget Sound.\nMany rules and regulations have been set out to try to conserve fishes and shorebirds in Puget Sound. The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) of Washington State has created aquatic reserves surrounding Smith and Minor Islands.\nOver of tidelands and seafloor habitat were included in the proposed aquatic reserve. Not only do these islands provide the necessary habitat for many seabirds such as tufted puffins and marine mammals, but this area also contains the largest kelp beds in all of Puget Sound. In addition, Protection Island reserve has also been off limits to the public to aid marine birds in breeding. Protection Island contains one of the last two nesting colonies of puffins in Puget Sound, and about 70% of the tufted puffin population nests on this island.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Produced by Francis Ford Coppola and co-written by Walter Murch, the film stars Robert Duvall and Donald Pleasence, with Don Pedro Colley, Maggie McOmie, and Ian Wolfe in supporting roles. The film is set in a dystopian future in which the citizens are controlled by android police and mandatory use of drugs that suppress emotions.\n\"THX 1138\" was developed from Lucas's 1967 student film \"\", which he created while attending the USC School of Cinematic Arts. The feature film was produced in a joint venture between Warner Bros. and American Zoetrope. A novelization by Ben Bova was published in 1971.\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics and underperformed at the box office upon its initial release, but it has subsequently received critical acclaim and gained a cult following, particularly in the aftermath of Lucas's success with \"Star Wars\" (1977). A director's cut prepared by Lucas was released in 2004.\nPlot.\nIn the dystopian future, sexual intercourse and reproduction are prohibited, and mind-altering drugs are mandatory to enforce compliance among the citizens and to ensure their ability to conduct dangerous and demanding tasks. Workers wear identical white uniforms and have shaven heads to emphasize uniformity, likewise with police androids who wear black and monks who are robed. Instead of names, people have designations with three arbitrary letters (referred to as the \"prefix\") and four digits, shown on an identity badge worn at all times.\nAt their jobs in central video control centers, SEN 5241 (a man) and LUH 3417 (a woman) keep surveillance on the city. LUH has a male roommate named THX 1138, who works in a factory producing android police officers. At the beginning of the story, THX finishes his shift while the loudspeakers urge the workers to \"increase safety\"\u2014and congratulate them for only losing 195 workers in the last period\u2014to the competing factory's 242. On the way home he stops at a confession booth. A Christ-like portrait of \"OMM 0000\" intones reassuringly as he worries that his sedatives are not working and LUH has been acting strangely.\nAt home, THX takes his drugs and watches holobroadcasts while engaging with a masturbatory device. LUH secretly substitutes pills in her possession for THX's medications, causing him to develop nausea, anxiety, and sexual desires. LUH and THX become involved romantically and have sex. THX is later confronted by SEN, who attempts to arrange that THX become his new roommate, but THX files a complaint against SEN for the illegal shift pattern change.\nWithout drugs in his system, THX falters during a critical and hazardous phase of his job, and a control center engages a \"mind lock\" on THX which raises the level of danger. After the release of the mind lock, THX makes the necessary correction to that work phase. THX and LUH are arrested and THX undergoes drug therapy and medical analysis. He enjoys a brief reunion with LUH, but it is disrupted shortly after she reveals her pregnancy.\nAt THX's trial, it is stated that THX was clinically born. It is decided that it would be inefficient to terminate THX, so THX is sentenced to prison, alongside SEN. THX and SEN walk to search for an exit. Eventually they are joined by hologram actor SRT 5752, who starred in the holobroadcasts. SRT shows them the exit and suggests to them that they may have been going in circles. During the escape, THX and SRT are separated from SEN. Chased by the police androids, THX and SRT are trapped in a control center, from which THX learns that LUH has been \"consumed\", and her name has been reassigned to her fetus, numbered 66691, in a growth chamber. SEN eventually escapes to an area reserved for the monks of OMM, where a monk notices that SEN has no identification badge. SEN attacks him and later wanders into a child-rearing area, strikes up a conversation with children, and sits aimlessly until police androids apprehend him. THX and SRT steal two cars. SRT struggles to figure out how to drive the car. When SRT finally gets the car to move, he immediately crashes his car into a concrete pillar. After the crash, SRT is not found in the vehicle.\nPursued by two police androids on motorcycles, THX flees to the limits of the city. Android officers continue to pursue him as he briefly struggles with simian-like creatures identified as \"shell dwellers\" and arrives at a vertical shaft with an escape ladder. The android officers are ordered by Central Command to cease pursuit, on the grounds that the expense of his capture exceeds their allocated budget for THX. In a last-ditch attempt to convince THX to surrender, the officers claim that the area outside the \"city shell\" is uninhabitable, but he is undeterred and continues up the ladder. The city is then revealed to be entirely underground, while THX has escaped onto the surface, where he witnesses the sun setting.\nCast.\nThe announcer voices include those of Scott Beach, Terence McGovern, and David Ogden Stiers (billed as David Ogden Steers), all of whom had ties to the San Francisco Bay area, as did Lucas.\nProduction.\n\"THX 1138\" was the first film of a planned seven-picture slate commissioned by Warner Bros. from the 1969 incarnation of American Zoetrope. George Lucas wrote the initial script draft based on his earlier short film, but Francis Ford Coppola and Lucas agreed that it was unsatisfactory. Walter Murch assisted Lucas in writing an improved final draft. For some of SEN's dialogue in the film, the script included excerpts from speeches by Richard Nixon.\nThe script required almost the entire cast to shave their heads, either completely bald or with buzz cuts. As a publicity stunt, several actors were filmed having their first haircuts and shaves at unusual venues, with the results used in a promotional featurette titled \"\". Many of the extras were recruited from the nearby Synanon, an addiction-recovery program that later became a violent cult.\nFilming began on September 22, 1969. The schedule was planned for 35\u201340 days, completing in November 1969. Lucas filmed \"THX 1138\" in Techniscope.\nMost filming locations are in the San Francisco area, including the unfinished tunnels of the Bay Area Rapid Transit subway system, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the Marin County Civic Center in San Rafael designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, the Lawrence Hall of Science in Berkeley, the San Francisco International Airport and at a remote manipulator for a hot cell. Several scenes show one of the FAA 9020 IBM System/360 used for air traffic control multi-computer installation (the only version with a \"360 Mode\" button on the console). Studio sequences were shot at stages in Los Angeles, including a white stage for the \"white limbo\" sequences. Lucas used entirely natural light.\nThe chase scene features two Lola T70 Mk III race cars chased by Yamaha TA125/250cc two-stroke, race-replica motorcycles through two San Francisco Bay Area automotive tunnels: the Caldecott Tunnel between Oakland and Orinda and the underwater Posey Tube between Oakland and Alameda. According to Caleb Deschanel, cars drove at speeds of while filming the chase. Other cars appearing in the film include custom-built Ferrari Thomassima cars, one of which is on display in the Ferrari museum in Modena, Italy.\nThe chase features a motorcycle stunt in which stuntman Ronald \"Duffy\" Hambleton (credited as Duffy Hamilton) rode his police motorcycle full speed into a fallen scaffold, with a ramp built to his specification. He flew over the handlebars, was hit by the airborne motorcycle, landed in the street on his back, and slammed into the crashed car in which Duvall's character had escaped. According to Lucas, Hambleton was uninjured but angry at the people who came to his aid, worried that they may have ruined the stunt by walking into frame.\nTHX's final climb out to the daylight was filmed (with the camera rotated 90\u00b0) in the incomplete (and decidedly horizontal) Bay Area Rapid Transit Transbay Tube before installation of the track supports, with the actors using exposed reinforcing bars on the floor of the tunnel as a ladder. The end scene in which THX stands before the sunset was shot at Port Hueneme, California by a second unit of photographer Caleb Deschanel and Matthew Robbins, who played THX in this long shot.\nAfter completion of photography, Coppola scheduled one year for Lucas to complete postproduction. Lucas edited the film on a German-made K-E-M flatbed editor in his Mill Valley house by day and Walter Murch edited sound at night, comparing notes as each session ended. Murch compiled and synchronized the sound montage, which includes elements such as the \"overhead\" voices, radio chatter and announcements. The bulk of the editing was finished by mid-1970.\nOn completion of editing, Coppola took it to Warner Bros., the financiers. Studio executives disliked the film and insisted that Coppola provide the negative to an in-house editor, who cut about four minutes of the film prior to release.\nSoundtrack.\nThe soundtrack to \"THX 1138\", conducted by Lalo Schifrin, was released in 1970. Recording took place on October 15 and 16, 1970 at the Burbank Studios in Burbank, California.\nReception.\n\"THX 1138\" was released to theaters on March 11, 1971, and was a commercial flop, earning $945,000 in rentals for Warner Bros. and an overall loss for the studio. A contemporary survey found seven favorable, three mixed and five negative reviews.\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" awarded the film three stars out of four and wrote, \"\"THX 1138\" suffers somewhat from its simple storyline, but as a work of visual imagination it's special, and as haunting as parts of \"\", \"Silent Running\", and \"The Andromeda Strain\".\" Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" awarded two stars out of four and stated, \"The principal problem with this film is that it lacks imagination, the essential component of a science fiction film. Some persons might claim that the world of \"THX 1138\" is here right now. A more reasonable opinion would hold that we are facing the problems of that world right now. Time has passed the film by.\"\nVincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"It is not, however, as either chase drama, or social drama, that \"THX 1138\" is most interesting. Rather it's as a stunning montage of light, color and sound effects that create their own emotional impact\u00a0... Lucas's achievement in his first feature is all the more extraordinary when you realize that he is 25 years old, and that he shot most of the film in San Francisco, on a budget that probably would not cover the cost of half of one of the space ships in Stanley Kubrick's \"2001.\"\"\nArthur D. Murphy of \"Variety\" observed, \"Likely not to be an artistic or commercial success in its own time, the American Zoetrope (Francis Ford Coppola group) production just might in time become a classic of stylistic, abstract cinema.\" Charles Champlin of the \"Los Angeles Times\" praised the film as \"a stunning deployment of the aural and visual resources of the screen to suggest a fearful new world of tyranny by technology\", adding that \"Lucas is obviously a master of cinematic effects with a special remarkable gift for discovering the look of the future in mundane places like parking structures and office corridors.\" Champlin stressed that the \"real excitement of \"THX 1138\" is not really the message but the medium\u00a0\u2014 the use of film not to tell a story so much as to convey an experience, a credible impression of a fantastic and scary dictatorship of tomorrow.\"\nKenneth Turan wrote in \"The Washington Post\", \"Fortunately, the film comes over not at all trite but rather as enormously affecting. Lucas obviously believed strongly in this futuristic vision, and the film draws its vitality and unity from his belief, and from the fact that it was not bottled up to meet arbitrary conditions but allowed the free rein necessary to reach completeness.\" Penelope Houston of \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" commented, \"Details of the future society\u00a0\u2014 control panels, monitor screens, soothing TV commercial voices, unshakeably calm robot policemen, the human animal turned automaton in appearance and function, but breaking out into a doomed love affair\u00a0\u2014 are all tolerably persuasive, but in sum total rather a pile-up of predictability. On the Orwellian level of ideas, Lucas' passive new world is too indeterminate to carry enough conviction and, consequently, enough of a menacing charge.\"\nThe film has continued to earn critical acclaim and holds an approval rating of 84% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 69 reviews, with an average score of 6.8/10. The consensus reads: \"George Lucas's feature debut presents a spare, bleak, dystopian future, and features evocatively minimal set design and creepy sound effects.\" On Metacritic it has a weighted average score of 75 out of 100 based on 8 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\nAwards.\nThe film received a nomination at the 1971 Cannes Film Festival from the International Federation of Film Critics in the Directors' Fortnight section.\nVersions.\n1967 student film.\nThe first version was a 15-minute student film for the USC School of Cinematic Arts titled \"\". It was released as a bonus feature along with the 2004 director's cut release.\n1971 studio version.\nThe 1971 studio version, distributed to theaters, had five minutes removed (against Lucas' wishes) by Warner Bros. This 81-minute version has never been released in any home-media format.\n1977 restored version.\nIn 1977, after the success of \"Star Wars\", \"THX 1138\" was rereleased with the footage restored that had been deleted by Warner Bros., but it still failed to achieve popularity. This version was later released in VHS (88 minutes) and LaserDisc (86 minutes) formats.\n2004 director's cut.\nIn 2004, \"The George Lucas Director's Cut\" of the film was released. Under Lucas' supervision, the film underwent an extensive restoration and digital intermediate process by Lowry Digital and Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM), where the film's original negative was scanned, digital color correction was applied and a new digital master was created. Computer-generated imagery and audio/video restoration techniques were also applied to the film.\nAt Lucas's request, the previsualization team at Skywalker Ranch worked with ILM throughout mid-2003. The team also executed a single-day shoot to form the basis for new digital visual effects, mostly to expand scenes by extending crowds and adding detail to settings and backgrounds for many scenes.\nThese changes increased the runtime of the film to 88 minutes. This director's cut was released to a limited number of digital-projection theaters on September 10, 2004, and then on DVD on September 14, 2004. The film was released on Blu-ray on September 7, 2010. With the addition of the added content, the film's MPAA rating was changed from GP (now known as PG) to R for \"sexuality/nudity\". It is the only film directed by Lucas to carry an \"R\" rating.\nNovelization.\nA novelization based on the film was written by Ben Bova and published in 1971. It follows the film's plot closely, with four additions:\nEtymology and references.\nThe significance of the name THX 1138 has been the subject of much speculation. Lucas chose the letters and numbers for their aesthetic qualities, especially their symmetry. Lucas named the film after his telephone number while in college, 849-1138\u2014the letters THX correspond to the numbers 8, 4, and 9 on the keypad. However, Walter Murch said that he always believed that Lucas intended THX to be \"sex\", LUH to be \"love\", and SEN to be \"sin\". John Lithgow described the title \"THX 1138\" as \"reading like a license plate number\".\nNumerous references to \"1138\" or \"THX 1138\" appear throughout the \"Star Wars\" franchise, and other of Lucas' films. THX 138 is the license plate number of John Milner's hot rod in \"American Graffiti\". Lucas founded THX Ltd., developer of the \"THX\" audiovisual reproduction standards.\nDuring the final chase sequence a voice over the radio can be heard in actor Robert Duvall's car saying, \"I think I ran over something. I ran over a Wookiee back there on the expressway.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31198", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31198", "title": "Tuning fork", "text": "Device that generates sounds of constant pitch when struck\nA tuning fork is an acoustic resonator in the form of a two-pronged fork with the prongs (\"tines\") formed from a U-shaped bar of elastic metal (usually steel). It resonates at a specific constant pitch when set vibrating by striking it against a surface or with an object, and emits a pure musical tone once the high overtones fade out. A tuning fork's pitch depends on the length and mass of the two prongs. They are traditional sources of standard pitch for tuning musical instruments.\nThe tuning fork was invented in 1711 by British musician John Shore, sergeant trumpeter and lutenist to the royal court.\nDescription.\nA tuning fork is a fork-shaped acoustic resonator used in many applications to produce a fixed tone. The main reason for using the fork shape is that, unlike many other types of resonators, it produces a very pure tone, with most of the vibrational energy at the fundamental frequency. The reason for this is that the frequency of the first overtone is about = = &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;6+1\u20444 times the fundamental (about &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2+1\u20442 octaves above it). By comparison, the first overtone of a vibrating string or metal bar is one octave above (twice) the fundamental, so when the string is plucked or the bar is struck, its vibrations tend to mix the fundamental and overtone frequencies. When the tuning fork is struck, little of the energy goes into the overtone modes; they also die out correspondingly faster, leaving a pure sine wave at the fundamental frequency. It is easier to tune other instruments with this pure tone.\nAnother reason for using the fork shape is that it can then be held at the base without damping the oscillation. That is because its principal mode of vibration is symmetric, with the two prongs always moving in opposite directions, so that at the base where the two prongs meet there is a node (point of no vibratory motion) which can therefore be handled without removing energy from the oscillation (damping). However, there is still a tiny motion induced in the handle in its longitudinal direction (thus at right angles to the oscillation of the prongs) which can be made audible using any sort of sound board. Thus by pressing the tuning fork's base against a sound board such as a wooden box, table top, or bridge of a musical instrument, this small motion, but which is at a high acoustic pressure (thus a very high acoustic impedance), is partly converted into audible sound in air which involves a much greater motion (particle velocity) at a relatively low pressure (thus low acoustic impedance). The pitch of a tuning fork can also be heard directly through bone conduction, by pressing the tuning fork against the bone just behind the ear, or even by holding the stem of the fork in one's teeth, conveniently leaving both hands free. Bone conduction using a tuning fork is specifically used in the Weber and Rinne tests for hearing in order to bypass the middle ear. If just held in open air, the sound of a tuning fork is very faint due to the acoustic impedance mismatch between the steel and air. Moreover, since the feeble sound waves emanating from each prong are 180\u00b0 out of phase, those two opposite waves interfere, largely cancelling each other. Thus when a solid sheet is slid in between the prongs of a vibrating fork, the apparent volume actually \"increases\", as this cancellation is reduced, just as a loudspeaker requires a baffle in order to radiate efficiently.\nCommercial tuning forks are tuned to the correct pitch at the factory, and the pitch and frequency in hertz is stamped on them. They can be retuned by filing material off the prongs. Filing the ends of the prongs raises the pitch, while filing the inside of the base of the prongs lowers it.\nCurrently, the most common tuning fork sounds the note of A\u00a0= 440\u00a0Hz, the standard concert pitch that many orchestras use. That A is the pitch of the violin's second-highest string, the highest string of the viola, and an octave above the highest string of the cello. Orchestras between 1750 and 1820 mostly used A\u00a0= 423.5\u00a0Hz, though there were many forks and many slightly different pitches. Standard tuning forks are available that vibrate at all the pitches within the central octave of the piano, and also other pitches.\nTuning fork pitch varies slightly with temperature, due mainly to a slight decrease in the modulus of elasticity of steel with increasing temperature. A change in frequency of 48\u00a0parts per million per\u00a0\u00b0F (86\u00a0ppm per\u00a0\u00b0C) is typical for a steel tuning fork. The frequency decreases (becomes flat) with increasing temperature. Tuning forks are manufactured to have their correct pitch at a standard temperature. The standard temperature is now , but is an older standard. The pitch of other instruments is also subject to variation with temperature change.\nCalculation of frequency.\nThe frequency of a tuning fork depends on its dimensions and what it is made from. Using the , the fundamental frequency of the tuning fork is:\n formula_1\nwhere\n f is the frequency the fork vibrates at, (SI units: Hz or 1/s)\n \"\u03b1\" \u22481.875 is the smallest positive real solution to cos(\"\u03b1\")cosh(\"\u03b1\") \n \u22121, which arises from the boundary conditions of the prong's cantilevered structure.\n L is the length of the prongs, (m)\n E is the Young's modulus (elastic modulus or stiffness) of the material the fork is made from, (Pa or N/m2 or kg/(ms2))\n I is the second moment of area of the cross-section, (m4)\n \u03c1 is the density of the fork's material (kg/m3), and\n A is the cross-sectional area of the prongs (tines), (m2).\nThe ratio \"k\"2 \n \"I\"/\"A\" in the equation above, where k is the radius of gyration for the prongs, can be rewritten as \"r\"2/4 if the prongs are cylindrical with radius r, and \"b\"2/12 if the prongs have rectangular cross-section of width b along the direction of motion.\nUses.\nTuning forks have traditionally been used to tune musical instruments, though electronic tuners have largely replaced them. Forks can be driven electrically by placing electronic oscillator-driven electromagnets close to the prongs.\nIn musical instruments.\nA number of keyboard musical instruments use principles similar to tuning forks. The most popular of these is the Rhodes piano, in which hammers hit metal tines that vibrate in the magnetic field of a pickup, creating a signal that drives electric amplification. The earlier, un-amplified dulcitone, which used tuning forks directly, suffered from low volume.\nIn clocks and watches.\nThe quartz crystal that serves as the timekeeping element in modern quartz clocks and watches is in the form of a tiny tuning fork. It usually vibrates at a frequency of 32,768\u00a0Hz in the ultrasonic range (above the range of human hearing). It is made to vibrate by small oscillating voltages applied by an electronic oscillator circuit to metal electrodes plated on the surface of the crystal. Quartz is piezoelectric, so the voltage causes the tines to bend rapidly back and forth.\nThe Accutron, an electromechanical watch developed by Max Hetzel and manufactured by Bulova beginning in 1960, used a 360-hertz steel tuning fork as its timekeeper, powered by electromagnets attached to a battery-powered transistor oscillator circuit. The fork provided greater accuracy than conventional balance wheel watches. The humming sound of the tuning fork was audible when the watch was held to the ear.\nMedical and scientific uses.\nAlternatives to the common A=440 standard include philosophical or scientific pitch with standard pitch of C=512. According to Rayleigh, physicists and acoustic instrument makers used this pitch. The tuning fork John Shore gave to George Frideric Handel produces C=512.\nTuning forks, usually C512, are used by medical practitioners to assess a patient's hearing. This is most commonly done with two exams called the Weber test and Rinne test, respectively. Lower-pitched ones, usually at C128, are also used to check vibration sense as part of the examination of the peripheral nervous system.\nOrthopedic surgeons have explored using a tuning fork (lowest frequency C=128) to assess injuries where bone fracture is suspected. They hold the end of the vibrating fork on the skin above the suspected fracture, progressively closer to the suspected fracture. If there is a fracture, the periosteum of the bone vibrates and fires nociceptors (pain receptors), causing a local sharp pain. This can indicate a fracture, which the practitioner refers for medical X-ray. The sharp pain of a local sprain can give a false positive. Established practice, however, requires an X-ray regardless, because it's better than missing a real fracture while wondering if a response means a sprain. A systematic review published in 2014 in BMJ Open suggests that this technique is not reliable or accurate enough for clinical use.\nNon-medical and non-scientific uses.\nTuning forks also play a role in several alternative therapy practices, such as sonopuncture and polarity therapy.\nRadar gun calibration.\nA radar gun that measures the speed of cars or a ball in sports is usually calibrated with a tuning fork. Instead of the frequency, these forks are labeled with the calibration speed and radar band (e.g., X-band or K-band) they are calibrated for.\nIn gyroscopes.\nDoubled and H-type tuning forks are used for tactical-grade Vibrating Structure Gyroscopes and various types of microelectromechanical systems.\nLevel sensors.\nTuning fork forms the sensing part of vibrating point level sensors. The tuning fork is kept vibrating at its resonant frequency by a piezoelectric device. Upon coming in contact with solids, amplitude of oscillation goes down, the same is used as a switching parameter for detecting point level for solids. For liquids, the resonant frequency of tuning fork changes upon coming in contact with the liquids, change in frequency is used to detect level.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The early trireme was a development of the penteconter, an ancient warship with a single row of 25 oars on each side (i.e., a single-banked boat), and of the bireme (, ), a warship with two banks of oars, of Phoenician origin. The word \"dieres\" does not appear until the Roman period. According to Morrison and Williams, \"It must be assumed the term pentekontor covered the two-level type\". As a ship, it was fast and agile and was the dominant warship in the Mediterranean from the 7th to the 4th centuries BC, after which it was largely superseded by the larger quadriremes and quinqueremes. Triremes played a vital role in the Persian Wars, the creation of the Athenian maritime empire and its downfall during the Peloponnesian War.\nMedieval and early modern galleys with three files of oarsmen per side are sometimes referred to as triremes.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nDepictions of two-banked ships (biremes), with or without the \"parexeiresia\" (the outriggers, see below), are common in 8th century BC and later vases and pottery fragments, and it is at the end of that century that the first references to three-banked ships are found. Fragments from an 8th-century relief at the Assyrian capital of Nineveh depicting the fleets of Tyre and Sidon show ships with rams, and fitted with oars pivoted at two levels. They have been interpreted as two-decked warships, and also as triremes.\nModern scholarship is divided on the provenance of the trireme, Greece or Phoenicia, and the exact time it developed into the foremost ancient fighting ship. According to Thucydides, the trireme was introduced to Greece by the Corinthians in the late 8th century BC, and the Corinthian Ameinocles built four such ships for the Samians. This was interpreted by later writers, Pliny and Diodorus, to mean that triremes were \"invented\" in Corinth. Clement of Alexandria in the 2nd century, drawing on earlier works, explicitly attributes the invention of the trireme (\"trikrotos naus\", \"three-banked ship\") to the Sidonians the possibility remains that the earliest three-banked warships originated in Phoenicia.\nEarly use and development.\nHerodotus mentions that the Egyptian pharaoh Necho II (610\u2013595 BC) built triremes on the Nile, for service in the Mediterranean, and in the Red Sea, but this reference is disputed by modern historians, and attributed to a confusion, since \"tri\u0113r\u0113s\" was by the 5th century used in the generic sense of \"warship\", regardless its type. The first definite reference to the use of triremes in naval combat dates to c.\u2009525\u00a0BC, when, according to Herodotus, the tyrant Polycrates of Samos was able to contribute 40 triremes to a Persian invasion of Egypt (Battle of Pelusium). The Persians were the first nation to use triremes in significant numbers. By 490 BC, triremes were the backbone of the Persian fleet. Thucydides clearly states that in the time of the Persian Wars, the majority of the Greek navies consisted of (probably two-tiered) penteconters and \"ploia makr\u00e1\" (\"long ships\").\nIn any case, by the early 5th century, the trireme was becoming the dominant warship type of the eastern Mediterranean, with minor differences between the \"Greek\" and \"Phoenician\" types, as literary references and depictions of the ships on coins make clear. The first large-scale naval battle where triremes participated was the Battle of Lade during the Ionian Revolt, where the combined fleets of the Greek Ionian cities were defeated by the Persian fleet, composed of squadrons from their Phoenician, Carian, and Egyptian subjects.\nThe Persian Wars.\nAthens was at that time embroiled in a conflict with the neighbouring island of Aegina, which possessed a formidable navy. In order to counter this, and possibly with an eye already at the mounting Persian preparations, in 483/2 BC the Athenian statesman Themistocles used his political skills and influence to persuade the Athenian assembly to start the construction of 200 triremes, using the income of the newly discovered silver mines at Laurion. The first clash with the Persian navy was at the Battle of Artemisium, where both sides suffered great casualties. However, the decisive naval clash occurred at Salamis, where Xerxes' invasion fleet was decisively defeated.\nAfter Salamis and another Greek victory over the Persian fleet at Mycale, the Ionian cities were freed, and the Delian League was formed under the aegis of Athens. Gradually, the predominance of Athens turned the League effectively into an Athenian Empire. The source and foundation of Athens' power was her strong fleet, composed of over 200 triremes. It not only secured control of the Aegean Sea and the loyalty of her allies, but also safeguarded the trade routes and the grain shipments from the Black Sea, which fed the city's burgeoning population. In addition, as it provided permanent employment for the city's poorer citizens, the fleet played an important role in maintaining and promoting the radical Athenian form of democracy. Athenian maritime power is the first example of thalassocracy in world history. Aside from Athens, other major naval powers of the era included Syracuse, Corfu and Corinth.\nIn the subsequent Peloponnesian War, naval battles fought by triremes were crucial in the power balance between Athens and Sparta. Despite numerous land engagements, Athens was finally defeated through the destruction of her fleet during the Sicilian Expedition, and finally, at the Battle of Aegospotami, at the hands of Sparta and her allies.\nDesign.\nBased on all archeological evidence, the design of the trireme most likely pushed the technological limits of the ancient world. After gathering the proper timbers and materials it was time to consider the fundamentals of the trireme design. These fundamentals included accommodations, propulsion, weight and waterline, centre of gravity and stability, strength, and feasibility. All of these variables are dependent on one another; however a certain area may be more important than another depending on the purpose of the ship.\nThe arrangement and number of oarsmen is the first deciding factor in the size of the ship. For a ship to travel at high speeds would require a high oar-gearing, which is the ratio between the outboard length of an oar and the inboard length; it is this arrangement of the oars which is unique and highly effective for the trireme. The ports would house the oarsmen with a minimal waste of space. There would be three files of oarsmen on each side tightly but workably packed by placing each man outboard of, and in height overlapping, the one below, provided that thalamian tholes were set inboard and their ports enlarged to allow oar movement. \nThalamian, zygian, and thranite are the English terms for ' (), ' (), and \"\" (), the Greek words for the oarsmen in, respectively the lowest, middle, and uppermost files of the triereis. \nThe tholes were pins that acted as fulcrums to the oars that allowed them to move. The center of gravity of the ship is low because of the overlapping formation of the files that allow the ports to remain closer to the ships walls. A lower center of gravity would provide adequate stability.\nThe trireme was constructed to maximize all traits of the ship to the point where if any changes were made the design would be compromised. Speed was maximized to the point where any less weight would have resulted in considerable losses to the ship's integrity. The center of gravity was placed at the lowest possible position where the Thalamian tholes were just above the waterline which retained the ship's resistance to waves and the possible rollover. If the center of gravity were placed any higher, the additional beams needed to restore stability would have resulted in the exclusion of the Thalamian tholes due to the reduced hull space. The purpose of the area just below the center of gravity and the waterline known as the \"\" () was to allow bending of the hull when faced with up to 90\u00a0kN of force. The calculations of forces that could have been absorbed by the ship are arguable because there is not enough evidence to confirm the exact process of jointing used in ancient times. In a modern reconstruction of the ship, a polysulphide sealant was used to compare to the caulking that evidence suggests was used; however this is also contentious because there is simply not enough evidence to authentically reproduce the triereis seams.\nTriremes required a great deal of upkeep in order to stay afloat, as references to the replacement of ropes, sails, rudders, oars and masts in the middle of campaigns suggest. They also would become waterlogged if left in the sea for too long. In order to prevent this from happening, ships would have to be pulled from the water during the night. The use of lightwoods meant that the ship could be carried ashore by as few as 140 men. Beaching the ships at night, however, would leave the troops vulnerable to surprise attacks. While well-maintained triremes would last up to 25 years, during the Peloponnesian War, Athens had to build nearly 20 triremes a year to maintain their fleet of 300.\nThe Athenian trireme had two great cables of about 47\u00a0mm in diameter and twice the ship's length called \"hypozomata\" (undergirding), and carried two spares. They were possibly rigged fore and aft from end to end along the middle line of the hull just under the main beams and tensioned to 13.5 tonnes force. The \"hypozomata\" were considered important and secret: their export from Athens was a capital offense. This cable would act as a stretched tendon straight down the middle of the hull, and would have prevented hogging. Additionally, hull plank butts would remain in compression in all but the most severe sea conditions, reducing working of joints and consequent leakage. The \"hypozomata\" would also have significantly braced the structure of the trireme against the stresses of ramming, giving it an important advantage in combat. According to material scientist J.E. Gordon: \"The \"hupozoma\" was therefore an essential part of the hulls of these ships; they were unable to fight, or even to go to sea at all, without it. Just as it used to be the practice to disarm modern warships by removing the breech-blocks from the guns, so, in classical times, disarmament commissioners used to disarm triremes by removing the \"hupozomata\".\"\nDimensions.\nExcavations of the ship sheds (\"ne\u014dsoikoi\", \u03bd\u03b5\u03ce\u03c3\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9) at the harbour of Zea in Piraeus, which was the main war harbour of ancient Athens, were first carried out by Dragatsis and Wilhelm D\u00f6rpfeld in the 1880s. These have provided us with a general outline of the Athenian trireme. The sheds were ca. 40 m long and just 6 m wide. These dimensions are corroborated by the evidence of Vitruvius, whereby the individual space allotted to each rower was 2 cubits. With the Doric cubit of 0.49 m, this results in an overall ship length of just under 37 m. The height of the sheds' interior was established as 4.026 metres, leading to estimates that the height of the hull above the water surface was ca. 2.15\u00a0metres. Its draught was relatively shallow, about 1\u00a0metre, which, in addition to the relatively flat keel and low weight, allowed it to be beached easily.\nConstruction.\nConstruction of the trireme differed from modern practice. The construction of a trireme was expensive and required around 6,000 man-days of labour to complete. The ancient Mediterranean practice was to build the outer hull first, and the ribs afterwards. To secure and add strength to the hull, cables (\"hypoz\u014dmata\") were employed, fitted in the keel and stretched by means of windlasses. Hence the triremes were often called \"girded\" when in commission.\nThe materials from which the trireme was constructed were an important aspect of its design. The three principal timbers included fir, pine, and cedar. Primarily the choice in timber depended on where the construction took place. For example, in Syria and Phoenicia, triereis were made of cedar, because pine was not readily available. Pine is stronger and more resistant to decay, but it is heavy, unlike fir, which was used because it was lightweight. The frame and internal structure would consist of pine and fir for a compromise between durability and weight.\nAnother very strong type of timber is oak; this was primarily used for the hulls of triereis, to withstand the force of hauling ashore. Other ships would usually have their hulls made of pine, because they would usually come ashore via a port or with the use of an anchor. It was necessary to ride the triereis onto the shores because there simply was no time to anchor a ship during war and gaining control of enemy shores was crucial in the advancement of an invading army. (Petersen) The joints of the ship required finding wood that was capable of absorbing water but was not completely dried out to the point where no water absorption could occur. There would be gaps between the planks of the hull when the ship was new, but, once submerged, the planks would absorb the water and expand, thus forming a watertight hull.\nProblems would occur, for example, when shipbuilders would use green wood for the hull; when green timber is allowed to dry, it loses moisture, which causes cracks in the wood that could cause catastrophic damage to the ship. The sailyards and masts were preferably made from fir, because fir trees were naturally tall, and provided these parts in usually a single piece. Making durable rope consisted of using both papyrus and white flax; the idea to use such materials is suggested by evidence to have originated in Egypt. In addition, ropes began being made from a variety of esparto grass in the later third century BC.\nThe use of light woods meant that the ship could be carried ashore by as few as 140 men, but also that the hull soaked up water, which adversely affected its speed and maneuverability. But it was still faster than other warships.\nOnce the triremes were seaworthy, it is argued that they were highly decorated with, \"eyes, nameplates, painted figureheads, and various ornaments\". These decorations were used both to show the wealth of the patrician and to make the ship frightening to the enemy. The home port of each trireme was signaled by the wooden statue of a deity located above the bronze ram on the front of the ship. In the case of Athens, since most of the fleet's triremes were paid for by wealthy citizens, there was a natural sense of competition among the patricians to create the \"most impressive\" trireme, both to intimidate the enemy and to attract the best oarsmen. Of all military expenditure, triremes were the most labor- and (in terms of men and money) investment-intensive.\nPropulsion and capabilities.\nThe ship's primary propulsion came from the 170 oars (\"k\u014dpai\"), arranged in three rows, with one man per oar. Evidence for this is provided by Thucydides, who records that the Corinthian oarsmen carried \"each his oar, cushion (\"hypersion\") and oarloop\". The ship also had two masts, a main (\"histos megas\") and a small foremast (\"histos akateios\"), with square sails, while steering was provided by two steering oars at the stern (one at the port side, one to starboard).\nClassical sources indicate that the trireme was capable of sustained speeds of around at relatively leisurely oaring. There is also a reference by Xenophon of a single day's voyage from Byzantium to Heraclea Pontica, which translates as an average speed of . These figures seem to be corroborated by the tests conducted with the reconstructed \"Olympias\": a maximum speed of and a steady speed of could be maintained, with half the crew resting at a time. Given the imperfect nature of the reconstructed ship, as well as the fact that it was manned by totally untrained modern men and women, it is reasonable to suggest that ancient triremes, expertly built and navigated by trained men, would attain higher speeds.\nThe distance a trireme could cover in a given day depended much on the weather. On a good day, the oarsmen, rowing for 6\u20138 hours, could propel the ship between . There were rare instances, however, when experienced crews and new ships were able to cover nearly twice that distance (Thucydides mentions a trireme travelling 300 kilometres in one day). The commanders of the triremes also had to stay aware of the condition of their men. They had to keep their crews comfortably paced, so as not to exhaust them before battle.\nCrew.\nThe total complement (\"pl\u0113r\u014dma\") of the ship was about 200. These were divided into the 170 rowers (\"eretai\"), who provided the ship's motive power, the deck crew headed by the trierarch and a marine detachment. The trierarch would be situated in the rear of the ship, and relay orders to the rest of the crew via the rowmaster. For the crew of Athenian triremes, the ships were an extension of their democratic beliefs. Rich and poor rowed alongside each other. Victor Davis Hanson argues that this \"served the larger civic interest of acculturating thousands as they worked together in cramped conditions and under dire circumstances.\"\nDuring the Peloponnesian War, there were a few variations to the typical crew layout of a trireme. One was a drastically reduced number of oarsmen, so as to use the ship as a troop transport. The thranites would row from the top benches while the rest of the space, below, would be filled with hoplites. In another variation, the Athenians used 10 or so trireme for transporting horses. Such triremes had 60 oarsmen, and rest of the ship was for horses.\nThe trireme was designed for day-long journeys, with no capacity to stay at sea overnight, or to carry the provisions needed to sustain its crew overnight. Each crewman required 2 gallons (7.6 l) of fresh drinking water to stay hydrated each day, but it is unknown quite how this was stored and distributed. This meant that all those aboard were dependent upon the land and peoples of wherever they landed each night for supplies. Sometimes this would entail traveling up to eighty kilometres in order to procure provisions. In the Peloponnesian War, the beached Athenian fleet was caught unawares on more than one occasion, while out looking for food (Battle of Syracuse and Battle of Aegospotami). Cities visited, which suddenly found themselves needing to provide for large numbers of sailors, usually did not mind the extra business, though those in charge of the fleet had to be careful not to deplete them of resources.\nTrierarch.\nIn Athens, the ship's patron was known as the trierarch (\"tri\u0113rarchos\"). He was a wealthy Athenian citizen (usually from the class of the \"pentakosiomedimnoi\"), responsible for manning, fitting out and maintaining the ship for his liturgical year at least; the ship itself belonged to Athens. The \"tri\u0113rarchia\" was one of the liturgies of ancient Athens; although it afforded great prestige, it constituted a great financial burden, so that in the 4th century, it was often shared by two citizens, and after 397 BC it was assigned to special boards.\nDeck crew.\nThe deck and command crew (\"hyp\u0113resia\") was headed by the helmsman, the \"kybern\u0113t\u0113s\", who was always an experienced seaman and was often the commander of the vessel. These experienced sailors were to be found on the upper levels of the triremes. Other officers were the bow lookout (\"pr\u014dreus\" or \"pr\u014drat\u0113s\"), the boatswain (\"keleust\u0113s\"), the quartermaster (\"pent\u0113kontarchos\"), the shipwright (\"naup\u0113gos\"), the piper (\"aul\u0113t\u0113s\") who gave the rowers' rhythm and two superintendents (\"toicharchoi\"), in charge of the rowers on each side of the ship. What constituted these sailors' experience was a combination of superior rowing skill (physical stamina and/or consistency in hitting with a full stroke) and previous battle experience. The sailors were likely in their thirties and forties. In addition, there were ten sailors handling the masts and the sails.\nRowers.\nIn the ancient navies, crews were composed not of galley slaves but of free men. In the Athenian case in particular, service in ships was the integral part of the military service provided by the lower classes, the \"th\u0113tai\", although metics and hired foreigners were also accepted. Although it has been argued that slaves formed part of the rowing crew in the Sicilian Expedition, a typical Athenian trireme crew during the Peloponnesian War consisted of 80 citizens, 60 metics and 60 foreign hands. Indeed, in the few emergency cases where slaves were used to crew ships, these were deliberately set free, usually before being employed. For instance, the tyrant Dionysius I of Syracuse once set all slaves of Syracuse free to man his galleys, employing thus freedmen, but otherwise relied on citizens and foreigners as oarsmen.\nIn the Athenian navy, the crews enjoyed long practice in peacetime, becoming skilled professionals and ensuring Athens' supremacy in naval warfare. The rowers were divided according to their positions in the ship into \"thranitai\", \"zygitai\", and \"thalamitai\". According to the excavated Naval Inventories, lists of ships' equipment compiled by the Athenian naval boards, there were:\nMost of the rowers (108 of the 170 \u2013 the \"zygitai\" and \"thalamitai\"), due to the design of the ship, were unable to see the water and therefore, rowed blindly, therefore coordinating the rowing required great skill and practice. It is not known exactly how this was done, but there are literary and visual references to the use of gestures and pipe playing to convey orders to rowers. In the sea trials of the reconstruction \"Olympias\", it was evident that this was a difficult problem to solve, given the amount of noise that a full rowing crew generated. In Aristophanes' play \"The Frogs\" two different rowing chants can be found: \"\"ryppapai\" and \"o opop\"\", both corresponding quite well to the sound and motion of the oar going through its full cycle.\nMarines.\nA varying number of marines (\"epibatai\"), usually 10\u201320, were carried aboard for boarding actions. At the Battle of Salamis, each Athenian ship was recorded to have 14 hoplites and 4 archers (usually Scythian mercenaries) on board, but Herodotus narrates that the Chiots had 40 hoplites on board at Lade and that the Persian ships carried a similar number. This reflects the different practices between the Athenians and other, less professional navies. Whereas the Athenians relied on speed and maneuverability, where their highly trained crews had the advantage, other states favored boarding, in a situation that closely mirrored the one that developed during the First Punic War. Grappling hooks would be used both as a weapon and for towing damaged ships (ally or enemy) back to shore. When the triremes were alongside each other, marines would either spear the enemy or jump across and cut the enemy down with their swords. As the presence of too many heavily armed hoplites on deck tended to destabilize the ship, the \"epibatai\" were normally seated, only rising to carry out any boarding action. The hoplites belonged to the middle social classes, so that they came immediately next to the trierarch in status aboard the ship.\nTactics.\nIn the ancient world, naval combat relied on two methods: boarding and ramming. Artillery in the form of ballistas and catapults was widespread, especially in later centuries, but its inherent technical limitations meant that it could not play a decisive role in combat. The method for boarding was to brush alongside the enemy ship, with oars drawn in, in order to break the enemy's oars and render the ship immobile (which disables the enemy ship from simply getting away), then to board the ship and engage in hand-to-hand combat.\nRams (\"embola\") were fitted to the prows of warships, and were used to rupture the hull of the enemy ship. The preferred method of attack was to come in from astern, with the aim not of creating a single hole, but of rupturing as big a length of the enemy vessel as possible. The speed necessary for a successful impact depended on the angle of attack; the greater the angle, the lesser the speed required. At 60 degrees, was enough to penetrate the hull, while it increased to at 30 degrees. If the target for some reason was in motion in the direction of the attacker, even less speed was required, and especially if the hit came amidships. The Athenians especially became masters in the art of ramming, using light, un-decked (\"aphraktai\") triremes.\nIn either case, the masts and railings of the ship were taken down prior to engagement to reduce the opportunities for opponents' grappling hooks.\nOn-board forces.\nUnlike the naval warfare of other eras, boarding an enemy ship was not the primary offensive action of triremes. Triremes' small size allowed for a limited number of marines to be carried aboard. During the 5th and 4th centuries, the trireme's strength was in its maneuverability and speed, not its armor or boarding force. That said, fleets less confident in their ability to ram were prone to load more marines onto their ships.\nOn the deck of a typical trireme in the Peloponnesian War there were 4 or 5 archers and 10 or so marines. These few troops were peripherally effective in an offensive sense, but critical in providing defense for the oarsmen. Should the crew of another trireme board, the marines were all that stood between the enemy troops and the slaughter of the men below. It has also been recorded that if a battle were to take place in the calmer water of a harbor, oarsmen would join the offensive and throw stones (from a stockpile aboard) to aid the marines in harassing/attacking other ships.\nNaval strategy in the Peloponnesian War.\nSquadrons of triremes employed a variety of tactics. The \"periplous\" (Gk., \"sailing around\") involved outflanking or encircling the enemy so as to attack them in the vulnerable rear; the \"diekplous\" (Gk., \"Sailing out through\") involved a concentrated charge so as to break a hole in the enemy line, allowing galleys to break through and then wheel to attack the enemy line from behind; and the \"kyklos\" (Gk., \"circle\") and the \"m\u0113noeid\u0113s kyklos\" (Gk. \"half-circle\"; literally, \"moon-shaped (i.e. crescent-shaped) circle\"), were defensive tactics to be employed against these manoeuvres. In all of these manoeuvres, the ability to accelerate faster, row faster, and turn more sharply than one's enemy was very important.\nAthens' strength in the Peloponnesian War came from its navy, whereas Sparta's came from its land-based Hoplite army. As the war progressed however the Spartans came to realize that if they were to undermine Pericles' strategy of outlasting the Peloponnesians by remaining within the walls of Athens indefinitely (a strategy made possible by Athens' Long Walls and fortified port of Piraeus), they were going to have to do something about Athens superior naval force. Once Sparta gained Persia as an ally, they had the funds necessary to construct the new naval fleets necessary to combat the Athenians. Sparta was able to build fleet after fleet, eventually destroying the Athenian fleet at the Battle of Aegospotami. The Spartan General Brasidas summed up the difference in approach to naval warfare between the Spartans and the Athenians: \"Athenians relied on speed and maneuverability on the open seas to ram at will clumsier ships; in contrast, a Peloponnesian armada might win only when it fought near land in calm and confined waters, had the greater number of ships in a local theater, and if its better-trained marines on deck and hoplites on shore could turn a sea battle into a contest of infantry.\" In addition, compared to the high-finesse of the Athenian navy (superior oarsmen who could outflank and ram enemy triremes from the side), the Spartans (as well as their allies and other enemies of Athens) would focus mainly on ramming Athenian triremes head on. It would be these tactics, in combination with those outlined by Brasidas, that led to the defeat of the Athenian fleet at the Second Battle of Syracuse during the Sicilian Expedition.\nCasualties.\nOnce a naval battle was under way, for the men involved, there were numerous ways for them to meet their end. Drowning was perhaps the most common way for a crew member to perish. Once a trireme had been rammed, the ensuing panic that engulfed the men trapped below deck no doubt extended the amount of time it took the men to escape. Inclement weather would greatly decrease the crew's odds of survival, leading to a situation like that off Cape Athos in 411 (12 of 10,000 men were saved). An estimated 40,000 Persians died in the Battle of Salamis. In the Peloponnesian War, after the Battle of Arginusae, six Athenian generals were executed for failing to rescue several hundred of their men clinging to wreckage in the water.\nIf the men did not drown, they might be taken prisoner by the enemy. In the Peloponnesian War, \"Sometimes captured crews were brought ashore and either cut down or maimed \u2013 often grotesquely, by cutting off the right hand or thumb to guarantee that they could never row again.\" The image found on an early-5th-century black-figure, depicting prisoners bound and thrown into the sea being pushed and prodded under water with poles and spears, shows that enemy treatment of captured sailors in the Peloponnesian War was often brutal. Being speared amid the wreckage of destroyed ships was likely a common cause of death for sailors in the Peloponnesian War.\nNaval battles were far more of a spectacle than the hoplite battles on land. Sometimes the battles raging at sea were watched by thousands of spectators on shore. Along with this greater spectacle, came greater consequences for the outcome of any given battle. Whereas the average percentage of fatalities from a land battle were between 10 and 15%, in a sea battle, the forces engaged ran the risk of losing their entire fleet. The number of ships and men in battles was sometimes very high. At the Battle of Arginusae for example, 263 ships were involved, making for a total of 55,000 men, and at the Battle of Aegospotami more than 300 ships and 60,000 seamen were involved. In Battle of Aegospotami, the city-state of Athens lost what was left of its navy: the once 'invincible' thalassocracy lost 170 ships (costing some 400 talents), and the majority of the crews were either killed, captured or lost.\nChanges of engagement and construction.\nDuring the Hellenistic period, the light trireme was supplanted by larger warships in dominant navies, especially the pentere/quinquereme. The maximum practical number of oar banks a ship could have was three. So the number in the type name did not refer to the banks of oars any more (as for biremes and triremes), but to the number of rowers per vertical section, with several men on each oar. The reason for this development was the increasing use of armour on the bows of warships against ramming attacks, which again required heavier ships for a successful attack. This increased the number of rowers per ship, and also made it possible to use less well-trained personnel for moving these new ships. This change was accompanied by an increased reliance on tactics like boarding, missile skirmishes and using warships as platforms for artillery.\nTriremes continued to be the mainstay of all smaller navies. While the Hellenistic kingdoms did develop the quinquereme and even larger ships, most navies of the Greek homeland and the smaller colonies could only afford triremes. They were used by the Diadochi Empires and sea powers like Syracuse, Carthage and later Rome. The difference to the classical 5th century Athenian ships was that they were armoured against ramming and carried significantly more marines. Lightened versions of the trireme and smaller vessels were often used as auxiliaries, and still performed quite effectively against the heavier ships, thanks to their greater manoeuvrability.\nWith the rise of the Roman Empire the biggest fleet of quinqueremes temporarily ruled the Mediterranean, but during the civil wars after Caesar's death the fleet was on the wrong side and a new warfare with light liburnas was developed. By Imperial times, Rome controlled the entirety of the Mediterranean and thus the need to maintain a powerful navy was minimal, as the only enemy they would be facing is pirates. As a result, the fleet was relatively small and had mostly political influence, controlling the grain supply and fighting pirates, who usually employed light biremes and liburnians. But instead of the successful liburnians of the Greek Civil War, it was again centred around light triremes, but still with many marines. Out of this type of ship, the dromon developed. \nThe \"Classis Germanica\", which guarded the imperial border on the Rhine river, used light river triremes, the \"Classis Britannica\", the Channel Fleet, had the task of logistical movement of personnel and support, and keeping open communication routes across the English Channel.\nReconstruction.\nIn 1985\u20131987 a shipbuilder in Piraeus, financed by Frank Welsh (an author, Suffolk banker, writer and trireme enthusiast), advised by historian J. S. Morrison and naval architect John F. Coates (who with Welsh founded the Trireme Trust that initiated and managed the project), and informed by evidence from underwater archaeology, built an Athenian-style trireme, \"Olympias\".\nCrewed by 170 volunteer oarsmen, \"Olympias\" in 1988 achieved . These results, achieved with inexperienced crew, suggest that the ancient writers were not exaggerating about straight-line performance. In addition, \"Olympias\" was able to execute a 180 degree turn in one minute and in an arc no wider than two and one half (2.5) ship-lengths. Additional sea trials took place in 1987, 1990, 1992 and 1994. In 2004 \"Olympias\" was used ceremonially to transport the Olympic Flame from the port of Keratsini to the main port of Piraeus as the 2004 Olympic Torch Relay entered its final stages in the run-up to the 2004 Summer Olympics opening ceremony.\nThe builders of the reconstruction project concluded that it effectively proved what had previously been in doubt, i.e., that Athenian triremes were arranged with the crew positioned in a staggered arrangement on three levels with one person per oar. This architecture would have made optimum use of the available internal dimensions. However, since modern humans are on average approximately 6\u00a0cm (2\u00a0inches) taller than Ancient Greeks (and the same relative dimensions can be presumed for oarsmen and other athletes), the construction of a craft which followed the precise dimensions of the ancient vessel led to cramped rowing conditions and consequent restrictions on the modern crew's ability to propel the vessel with full efficiency, which perhaps explains why the ancient speed records stand unbroken.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "31204", "revid": "44260906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31204", "title": "Tertullian", "text": "Roman Christian theologian and writer (c. 155 \u2013 c. 220)\nTertullian (; ; c. 155 \u2013 c. 220\u00a0AD) was a prolific early Christian author from Carthage in the Roman province of Africa. He was the first Christian author to produce an extensive corpus of Latin Christian literature and was an early Christian apologist and a polemicist against heresy, including contemporary Christian Gnosticism.\nTertullian was the first theologian to write in Latin, and so has been called \"the father of Latin Christianity\", as well as \"the founder of Western theology\". He is perhaps most famous for being the first writer in Latin known to use the term \"trinity\" (Latin: \"trinitas\").\nTertullian originated new theological concepts and advanced the development of early Church doctrine. However, some of his teachings, such as the subordination of the Son and Spirit to the Father, were later rejected by the Church. According to Jerome, he later joined the Montanist sect and may have apostasized; however, modern scholars dispute this.\nLife.\nScant reliable evidence exists regarding Tertullian's life; most knowledge comes from passing references in his own writings. Roman Africa was famous as the home of orators, and that influence can be seen in his writing style with its archaisms or provincialisms, its glowing imagery and its passionate temper. He was a scholar with an excellent education. He wrote at least three books in Koine Greek; none of them are extant.\nSome sources describe him as Berber. The linguist Ren\u00e9 Braun suggested that he was of Punic origin but acknowledged that it is difficult to decide since the heritage of Carthage had become common to the Berbers. Tertullian's own understanding of his ethnicity has been questioned: He referred to himself as \"Poenicum inter Romanos\" (lit.\u2009'Punic among Romans') in his book \"De Pallio\" and claimed Africa as his \"patria\". According to church tradition, Tertullian was raised in Carthage. Jerome claimed that Tertullian's father held the position of \"centurio proconsularis\" (\"aide-de-camp\") in the Roman army in Africa.\nTertullian has been claimed to have been a trained lawyer and an ordained priest. Those assertions rely on the accounts of Eusebius of Caesarea, \"Church History\", II, ii. 4, and Jerome's \"De viris illustribus\" (\"On famous men\") chapter 53. Tertullian has also been thought to be a lawyer, based on his use of legal analogies and on an identification of him with the jurist Tertullianus, who is quoted in the \"Pandects\". Although Tertullian used a knowledge of Roman law in his writings, his legal knowledge does not demonstrably exceed what could be expected from a sufficient Roman education. The writings of Tertullianus, a lawyer of the same \"agnomen\", exist only in fragments and do not explicitly denote a Christian authorship. The notion of Tertullian being a priest is also questionable. In his extant writings, he never describes himself as ordained in the church and seems to place himself among the laity.\nHis conversion to Christianity perhaps took place about 197\u2013198 (cf. Adolf Harnack, Bonwetsch, and others), but its immediate antecedents are unknown except as they are conjectured from his writings. The event must have been sudden and decisive, transforming at once his own personality. He writes that he could not imagine a truly Christian life without such a conscious breach, a radical act of conversion: \"Christians are made, not born\" (\"Apol\"., xviii). Two books addressed to his wife confirm that he was married to a Christian wife.\nIn his middle life (about 207), he was attracted to the \"New Prophecy\" of Montanism, but today most scholars reject the assertion that Tertullian left the mainstream church or was excommunicated. \"[W]e are left to ask whether Saint Cyprian could have regarded Tertullian as his master if Tertullian had been a notorious schismatic. Since no ancient writer was more definite (if not indeed fanatical) on this subject of schism than Saint Cyprian, the question must surely be answered in the negative.\"\nIn the time of Augustine, a group of \"Tertullianists\" still had a basilica in Carthage, which within the same period passed to the orthodox church. It is unclear whether the name was merely another for the North African Montanists or that it means that Tertullian later split with the Montanists and founded his own group.\nJerome says that Tertullian lived to old age. By the doctrinal works he published, Tertullian became the teacher of Cyprian and the predecessor of Augustine, a key figure of western theology.\nWritings.\nGeneral character.\nThirty-one works are extant, together with fragments of more. Some fifteen works in Latin or Greek are lost, some as recently as the 9th century (\"De Paradiso, De superstitione saeculi, De carne et anima\" were all extant in the now damaged Codex Agobardinus in 814 AD). Tertullian's writings cover the whole theological field of the time\u00a0\u2013 apologetics against paganism and Judaism, polemics, polity, discipline, and morals, or the whole reorganization of human life on a Christian basis; they gave a picture of the religious life and thought of the time which is of great interest to the church historian.\nLike other early Christian writers Tertullian used the term \"paganus\" to mean \"civilian\" as a contrast to the \"soldiers of Christ\". The motif of Miles Christi did not assume the literal meaning of participation in war until Church doctrines justifying Christian participation in battle were developed around the 5th century. In the 2nd-century writings of Tertullian, \"paganus\" meant a \"civilian\" who was lacking self-discipline. In \"De Corona Militis\" XI.V he writes:\nChronology and contents.\nThe chronology of his writings is difficult to fix with certainty. In his work against Marcion, which he calls his third composition on the Marcionite heresy, he gives its date as the fifteenth year of the reign of Severus (\"Adv. Marcionem\", i.1, 15) \u2013 which would be approximately 208.\nThe writings may be divided according to their subject matter, falling into two groups: Apologetic and polemic writings, like \"Apologeticus\", \"De testimonio animae\", the anti-Jewish \"\", \"Adv. Marcionem\", \"Adv. Praxeam\", \"Adv. Hermogenem\", \"De praescriptione hereticorum\", and \"Scorpiace\" were written to counteract Gnosticism and other religious or philosophical doctrines. The other group consists of practical and disciplinary writings, e.g., \"De monogamia\", \"Ad uxorem\", \"De virginibus velandis\", \"De cultu feminarum\", \"De patientia\", \"De pudicitia\", \"De oratione\", and \"Ad martyras\".\nAmong his apologetic writings, the \"Apologeticus\", addressed to the Roman magistrates, is a most pungent defense of Christianity and the Christians against the reproaches of the pagans, and an important legacy of the ancient Church, proclaiming the principle of freedom of religion as an inalienable human right and demanding a fair trial for Christians before they are condemned to death.\nTertullian was the first to disprove charges that Christians sacrificed infants at the celebration of the Lord's Supper and committed incest. He pointed to the commission of such crimes in the pagan world and then proved by the testimony of Pliny the Younger that Christians pledged themselves not to commit murder, adultery, or other crimes. He adduced the inhumanity of pagan customs such as feeding the flesh of gladiators to beasts. He argued that the gods have no existence and thus there is no pagan religion against which Christians may offend. Christians do not engage in the foolish worship of the emperors, that they do better: they pray for them, and that Christians can afford to be put to torture and to death, and the more they are cast down the more they grow; \"the blood of the Christians is seed\" (\"Apologeticum\", 50). In the \"De Praescriptione\" he develops as its fundamental idea that, in a dispute between the Church and a separating party, the whole burden of proof lies with the latter, as the Church, in possession of the unbroken tradition, is by its very existence a guarantee of its truth.\nThe five books against Marcion, written in 207 or 208, are the most comprehensive and elaborate of his polemical works, invaluable for gauging the early Christian view of Gnosticism. Tertullian has been identified by Jo Ann McNamara as the person who originally invested the consecrated virgin as the \"bride of Christ\".\nScholars in the past accepting the Montanist theory have also divided his work into earlier Catholic works and the later supposedly Montanist works (cf. Harnack, ii.262 sqq.), aiming to show the change of views Tertullian's mind underwent.\nManuscripts.\nThe earliest manuscript (handwritten copy) of any of Tertullian's works dates to the eighth century, but most are of the fifteenth. There are five main collections of Tertullian's works, known as the \"Cluniacense\", \"Corbeiense\", \"Trecense\", \"Agobardinum\" and \"Ottobonianus\". Some of Tertullian's works are lost. All the manuscripts of the \"Corbeiense\" collection are also now lost, although the collection survives in early printed editions.\nTheology.\nSpecific teachings.\nTertullian's main doctrinal teachings are as follows:\nGod.\nTertullian reserves the appellation God, in the sense of the ultimate originator of all things, to the Father, who made the world out of nothing through his Son, the Word, has corporeity, though he is a spirit (, vii.; , vii). However Tertullian used 'corporeal' only in the Stoic sense, to mean something with actual material existence, rather than the later idea of flesh.\nTertullian is often considered an early proponent of the Nicene doctrine, approaching the subject from the standpoint of the Logos doctrine, though he did not state the later doctrine of the immanent Trinity. In his treatise against Praxeas, who taught patripassianism in Rome, he used the words \"trinity\", \"economy\" (used in reference to the three persons), \"persons\", and \"substance\", maintaining the distinction of the Son from the Father as the unoriginate God, and the Spirit from both the Father and the Son (, xxv). \"These three are one substance, not one person; and it is said, 'I and my Father are one' in respect not of the singularity of number but the unity of the substance.\" The very names \"Father\" and \"Son\" indicate the distinction of personality. The Father is one, the Son is another, and the Spirit is another ( , ix)), and yet in defending the unity of God, he says the Son is not other (, ( 18) as a result of receiving a portion of the Father's substance. At times, speaking of the Father and the Son, Tertullian refers to \"two gods\". He says that all things of the Father belong also to the Son, including his names, such as Almighty God, Most High, Lord of Hosts, or King of Israel.\nThough Tertullian considered the Father to be God (Yahweh), he responded to criticism of the Modalist Praxeas that this meant that Tertullian's Christianity was not monotheistic by noting that even though there was one God (Yahweh, who became the Father when the Son became his agent of creation), the Son could also be referred to as God, when referred to apart from the Father, because the Son, though subordinate to God, is entitled to be called God \"from the unity of the Father\" in regards to being formed from a portion of His substance. \"The Catholic Encyclopedia\" comments that for Tertullian, \"There was a time when there was no Son and no sin, when God was neither Father nor Judge.\" Similarly J.N.D. Kelly stated: \"Tertullian followed the Apologists in dating His 'perfect generation' from His extrapolation for the work of creation; prior to that moment God could not strictly be said to have had a Son, while after it the term 'Father', which for earlier theologians generally connoted God as author of reality, began to acquire the specialized meaning of Father of the Son.\" As regards the subjects of subordination of the Son to the Father, the \"New Catholic Encyclopedia\" has commented: \"In not a few areas of theology, Tertullian's views are, of course, completely unacceptable. Thus, for example, his teaching on the Trinity reveals a subordination of Son to Father that in the later crass form of Arianism the Church rejected as heretical.\" Though he did not fully state the doctrine of the immanence of the Trinity, according to B. B. Warfield, he went a long distance in the way of approach to it.\nApostolicity.\nTertullian was a defender of the necessity of apostolicity. In his \"Prescription Against Heretics\", he explicitly challenges heretics to produce evidence of the apostolic succession of their communities.\nEucharist.\nUnlike many early Christian writers, Tertullian (along with Clement of Alexandria) used the word \"figure\" and \"symbol\" to define the Eucharist, since in his book \"Against Marcion\" he implied that \"this is my body\" should be interpreted as \"a figure of my body\"; others have also suggested that he believed in a spiritual presence in the Eucharist.\nBaptism.\nTertullian advises the postponement of baptism of little children and the unmarried, he mentions that it was customary to baptise infants, with sponsors speaking on their behalf. He argued that an infant ran the risk of growing up and then falling into sin, which could cause them to lose their salvation, if they were baptized as infants.\nContrary to early Syrian baptismal doctrine and practice, Tertullian describes baptism as a cleansing and preparation process which precedes the reception of the Holy Spirit in post-baptismal anointing ( 6). includes the earliest known mention of a prayer for the consecration of the waters of baptism.\nTertullian had an view of the baptism, thus the efficacy of baptism was not dependent upon the faith of the receiver. He also believed that in an emergency, the laity can give the baptism.\nThe Church.\nAccording to James Puglisi, Tertullian interpreted that in Matthew 16:18\u201319 \"the rock\" refers to Peter. For him, Peter is the type of the one Church and its origins, this Church, is now present in a variety of local churches. He mocked Pope Calixtus or Agrippinus (it is debated which one he was referring to) when he challenged him on the Church forgiving capital sinners and letting them back into the church. He believed that the people who committed grave sins, such as sorcery, fornication and murder, should not be let inside the church.\nMarriage.\nTertullian's later view of marriage, such as in his book \"Exhortation to Chastity\", may have been heavily influenced by Montanism. He had previously held marriage to be fundamentally good, but after his alleged conversion to Montanism he denied its goodness. He argues that marriage is considered to be good \"when it is compared with the greatest of all evils\". He argued that before the coming of Christ, the command to reproduce was a prophetic sign pointing to the coming of the Church; after it came, the command was superseded. He also believed lust for one's wife and for another woman were essentially the same, so that marital desire was similar to adulterous desire. He believed that sex even in marriage would disrupt the Christian life and that abstinence was the best way to achieve the clarity of the soul. Tertullian's views would later influence much of the western church.\nTertullian was the first to introduce a view of \"sexual hierarchy\": he believed that those who abstain from sexual relations should have a higher hierarchy in the church than those who do not, because he saw sexual relations as a barrier that stopped one from a close relationship with God.\nScripture.\nTertullian did not have a specific listing of the canon; however, he quotes 1 John, 1 Peter, Jude, Revelation, the Pauline epistles and the four Gospels. In his later books, he also started to use the Shepherd of Hermas. Tertullian made no references to the book of Tobit; however, in his book \"Adversus Marcionem\" he quotes the book of Judith. He quoted most of the Old Testament including many deuterocanonical books, however he never used the books of Chronicles, Ruth, Esther, 2 Maccabees, 2 John and 3 John. He defended the Book of Enoch and he believed that the book was omitted by the Jews from the canon. He believed that the epistle to the Hebrews was made by Barnabas. For Tertullian, scripture was authoritative; he used scripture as the primary source in almost every chapter of his every work, and very rarely anything else. He seems to prioritize the authority of scripture above anything else.\nWhen interpreting scripture, he would occasionally believe passages to be allegorical or symbolic, while in other places he would support a literal interpretation. He would especially use allegorical interpretations when dealing with Christological prophecies of the Old Testament. \nOther beliefs.\nTertullian denied Mary's virginity \"in partu\", and he was quoted by Helvidius in his debate with Jerome. He held similar views as Antidicomarians. J. N. D. Kelly argued that Tertullian believed that Mary had imperfections, thus denying her sinlessness.\nResearchers such as Mark Ellingsen believe that he held to a view similar to the Protestant priesthood of all believers and that the distinction of the clergy and the laity is only because of ecclesiastical institution and thus in an absence of a priest the laity can act as priests; his theory on the distinction of the laity and clergy is influenced by Montanism and his early writings do not have the same beliefs.\nHe believed in Iconoclasm.\nHe believed in historic premillennialism: that Christians will go through a period of tribulation, to be followed by a literal 1000-year reign of Christ.\nHe attacked the use of Greek philosophy in Christian theology. For him, philosophy supported religious idolatry and heresy. He believed that many people became heretical because of relying on philosophy. He stated \"What has Athens to do with Jerusalem?\"\nTertullian's views of angels and demons were influenced by the Book of Enoch. He held that the Nephilim were born out of fallen angels who mingled with human women and had sexual relations. He believed that because of the actions of the watchers as described in the Book of Enoch, men would later judge angels. He believed that angels are inferior to humans, and not made in the image of God. He believed that Angels are imperceptible to our senses, but they may choose to take on a human form or change shape.\nHe taught fideistic concepts such as the later philosophers William of Ockham and S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard.\nMontanism.\nThe extent and nature of Tertullian's involvement to Montanism is now disputed by modern scholars. Montanism in North Africa seems to have been a counter-reaction against secularism. The form of Montanism in North Africa seems to have differed from the views of Montanus, and thus the North African Montanists believed Catholic bishops to be successors of the apostles, the New Testament to be the supreme authority on Christianity and they did not deny most doctrines of the Church.\nTertullianists.\nTertullianists were a group mentioned by Augustine as founded by Tertullian. There exist differences of opinion on Tertullianists; Augustine seems to have believed that Tertullian, soon after joining the Montanists, started his own sect derived from Montanism, while some scholars believe that Augustine was in error, and that Tertullianists was simply an alternative name of North African Montanism and not a separate sect.\nMoral principles.\nTertullian was an advocate of discipline and an austere code of practise, and like many of the African fathers, one of the leading representatives of the rigorist element in the early Church. His writings on public amusements, the veiling of virgins, the conduct of women, and the like, reflect these opinions. His views may have led him to adopt Montanism with its ascetic rigor and its belief in chiliasm and the continuance of the prophetic gifts. Geoffrey D. Dunn writes that \"Some of Tertullian's treatises reveal that he had much in common with Montanism ... To what extent, if at all, this meant that he joined a group that was schismatic (or, to put it another way, that he left the church) continues to be debated\".\nOn the principle that we should not look at or listen to what we have no right to practise, and that polluted things, seen and touched, pollute (\"De spectaculis\", viii, xvii), he declared a Christian should abstain from the theatre and the amphitheatre. There pagan religious rites were applied and the names of pagan divinities invoked; there the precepts of modesty, purity, and humanity were ignored or set aside, and there no place was offered to the onlookers for the cultivation of the Christian graces. Women should put aside their gold and precious stones as ornaments, and virgins should conform to the law of St. Paul for women and keep themselves strictly veiled (\"De virginibus velandis\"). He praised the unmarried state as the highest (\"De monogamia\", xvii; \"Ad uxorem\", i.3) and called upon Christians not to allow themselves to be excelled in the virtue of celibacy by Vestal Virgins and Egyptian priests. He even labeled second marriage a species of adultery (\"De exhortatione castitatis\", ix), but this directly contradicted the Epistles of the Apostle Paul. Tertullian's resolve to never marry again and that no one else should remarry eventually led to his break with Rome because the orthodox church refused to follow him in this resolve. He, instead, favored the Montanist sect where they also condemned second marriage. One reason for Tertullian's disdain for marriage was his belief about the transformation that awaited a married couple. He believed that marital relations coarsened the body and spirit and would dull their spiritual senses and avert the Holy Spirit since husband and wife became one flesh once married.\nTertullian has been criticised as misogynistic, on the basis of the contents of his \"De Cultu Feminarum\", section I.I, part 2 (trans. C.W. Marx): \"Do you not know that you are Eve? The judgment of God upon this sex lives on in this age; therefore, necessarily the guilt should live on also. You are the gateway of the devil; you are the one who unseals the curse of that tree, and you are the first one to turn your back on the divine law; you are the one who persuaded him whom the devil was not capable of corrupting; you easily destroyed the image of God, Adam. Because of what you deserve, that is, death, even the Son of God had to die.\"\nThe critic Amy Place notes, however, that \"Revisionist studies later rehabilitated\" Tertullian. This is discussed by other theorists such as Benjamin H. Dunning.\nTertullian had a radical view on the cosmos. He believed that heaven and earth intersected at many points and that it was possible that sexual relations with supernatural beings can occur.\nWorks.\nTertullian's writings are edited in volumes 1\u20132 of the \"Patrologia Latina\", and modern texts exist in the \"Corpus Christianorum Latinorum\". English translations by Sydney Thelwall and Philip Holmes can be found in volumes III and IV of the \"Ante-Nicene Fathers\" which are freely available online; more modern translations of some of the works have been made.\nPossible chronology.\nThe following chronological ordering was proposed by John Kaye, Bishop of Lincoln in the 19th century:\nProbably mainstream (Pre-Montanist):\nIndeterminate:\nProbably Post-Montanist:\nDefinitely Post-Montanist:\nSpurious works.\nThere have been many works attributed to Tertullian in the past which have since been determined to be almost definitely written by others. Nonetheless, since their actual authors remain uncertain, they continue to be published together in collections of Tertullian's works.\nThe popular \"Passio sanctae Perpetuae et Felicitatis\" (Passion of Saints Perpetua and Felicity), much of it presented as the personal diary of Perpetua, was once assumed to have been edited by Tertullian. That view is no longer widely held, and the work is usually published separately from Tertullian's own works.\nInfluence on Novatianism.\nThe Novatians refused forgiveness to idolaters or for people who committed other heinous sins, and made much use of the works of Tertullian; some Novatians even joined Montanists. The views of Novatian on the Trinity and Christology are also strongly influenced by Tertullian.\nRonald E. Heine writes, \"With Novatianism we return to the spirit of Tertullian, and the issue of Christian discipline.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nPrimary sources\nSecondary sources"}

They were a roots rock band and described as \"perhaps the biggest supergroup of all time\".\nOriginating from an idea discussed by Harrison and Lynne during the sessions for Harrison's 1987 album \"Cloud Nine\", the band formed in April 1988 after the five members united to record a bonus track for Harrison's next European single. When this collaboration, \"Handle with Care\", was deemed too good for such a limited release, the group agreed to record a full album, titled \"Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1\", released in October 1988. Following Orbison's death in December 1988, the Wilburys continued as a quartet and released a second album, incongruously titled \"Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3\", in 1990.\nThe release of their debut album was much anticipated because of the stature of the participants. The band members adopted tongue-in-cheek pseudonyms as half-brothers from the fictional Wilbury family of travelling musicians. \"Vol. 1\" was a critical and commercial success, helping to revitalise Dylan's career. In 1990, the album won the Grammy for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group.\nAlthough Harrison envisioned a series of Wilburys albums and a film about the band, to be produced through his company HandMade, the group became dormant after 1991 and never officially reunited, though the individual members continued to collaborate on each other's solo projects at various times. Harrison died in 2001, followed by Petty in 2017, leaving Dylan and Lynne as the only surviving members. After being unavailable for several years, the two Wilburys albums were reissued by the Harrison estate in the 2007 box set \"The Traveling Wilburys Collection\".\nHistory.\nBackground.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNone of this would've happened without him. It was George's band \u2013 it was always George's band and it was a dream he had for a long time.\n \u2013 Tom Petty\nGeorge Harrison first mentioned the Traveling Wilburys publicly during a radio interview with Bob Coburn on the show \"Rockline\" in February 1988. When asked how he planned to follow up the success of his \"Cloud Nine\" album, Harrison replied: \"What I'd really like to do next is ... to do an album with me and some of my mates ... It's this new group I got [in mind]: it's called the Traveling Wilburys, I'd like to do an album with them and then later we can all do our own albums again.\" According to Jeff Lynne, who co-produced \"Cloud Nine\", Harrison introduced the idea of the two of them starting a band together around two months into the sessions for his album, which began in early January 1987. When discussing who the other members might be, Harrison chose Bob Dylan and Lynne opted for Roy Orbison.&lt;ref name=\"Lynne/Mojo\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The term \"Wilbury\" also originated during the \"Cloud Nine\" sessions. Referring to recording errors created by faulty equipment, Harrison jokingly remarked to Lynne, \"\"We'll bury\" 'em in the mix.\" Thereafter, they used the term for any small error in performance. Harrison first suggested \"the Trembling Wilburys\" as the group's name; at Lynne's suggestion, they amended it to \"Traveling Wilburys\".\nDuring his \"Rockline\" interview, Harrison voiced his support for Dylan, at a time when Dylan was experiencing an artistic and commercial low point in his career. Harrison and Lynne became friends with Tom Petty in October 1987, when Petty and his band, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, toured Europe as Dylan's backing group on the Temples in Flames Tour. The friendship continued in Los Angeles later that year. There, Harrison struck up a musical rapport with Petty based on their shared love of 1950s rock 'n' roll, and Lynne began collaborating with Petty on what became Petty's debut solo album, \"Full Moon Fever\", and writing songs with Orbison, Lynne's longtime musical hero, for Orbison's comeback album, \"Mystery Girl\". According to Petty, Harrison's dream for the Wilburys was to handpick the participants and create \"the perfect little band\", but the criteria for inclusion were governed most by \"who you could hang out with\". The five musicians also bonded over a shared appreciation of the English comedy troupe Monty Python. Harrison, who had worked with the members of Monty Python on various productions by his company HandMade Films since the late 1970s, particularly appreciated Orbison's gift for impersonation and his ability to recite entire sketches by the troupe.\n1988\u20131991.\n\"Handle with Care\" and band formation.\nThe band came together in April 1988, when Harrison was in Los Angeles to oversee the filming of his HandMade production \"Checking Out\". At that time, Warner Bros. Records asked Harrison for a new song to serve as the B-side for the European release of his third single from \"Cloud Nine\", \"This Is Love\". During a meal with Lynne and Orbison, Harrison asked Lynne to help him record the track and invited Orbison to attend the session, which he then arranged to take place at Dylan's garage studio in Malibu since no professional studios were available at such short notice. Petty's involvement came about when Harrison went to retrieve his guitar from Petty's house and invited him to attend also.\nWorking on a song that Harrison had recently started writing, the ensemble completed the track, which they titled \"Handle with Care\" after a label on a box in Dylan's garage. When Harrison presented the recording to Mo Ostin and Lenny Waronker of Warner Bros., the executives insisted that the song was too good to be used as a B-side. In Petty's recollection, Harrison and Lynne then decided to realise their idea of forming a Wilburys band, and first invited him to join before phoning Dylan, who also agreed to join. That night, Harrison, Lynne and Petty drove to Anaheim to see Orbison perform at the Celebrity Theatre and recruited him for the group shortly before he went on stage. In Petty's description, Orbison performed an \"unbelievable show\", during which \"we'd punch each other and go, 'He's in our band, too.' ... We were all so excited.\"&lt;ref name=\"Zimmer/BAM\"&gt; Available at https:// (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt;\nDebut album.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFrom my point of view, I just tried to preserve our relationship. I worked so hard to make sure that all the guys who were in that band, and consequently on record and film, that their friendship wasn't abused. Just to preserve our friendship \u2013 that was the underlying contribution, I think, that I was trying to do.\n \u2013 George Harrison\nThe band members decided to create a full album together, \"Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1\". Video footage of the creative process was later edited by Harrison into a promotional film for Warner Bros. staff, titled \"Whatever Wilbury Wilbury\". The album was recorded primarily over a ten-day period in May 1988, to allow for Dylan's limited availability as he prepared for the start of what became known as his Never Ending Tour and for Orbison's tour schedule. These sessions were held in the house of Eurythmics member Dave Stewart, in Los Angeles.\nThe five band members sat in a circle playing acoustic guitars in Stewart's kitchen; once each song's basic track had been written and recorded there (with accompaniment from a drum machine),&lt;ref name=\"Hurwitz/Mix\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the group recorded their vocals in another room, usually after dinner each night. Petty recalled that, as a friend but also an avowed fan of Dylan's, Harrison felt the need to clear the air on the first day by saying: \"We know that you're Bob Dylan and everything, but we're going to just treat you and talk to you like we would anybody else.\" Dylan replied: \"Well, great. Believe it or not, I'm in awe of you guys, and it's the same for me.\" While most of the songs had a primary composer, all of the band members were creative equals. Petty later described Harrison as the Wilburys' \"leader and manager\", and credited him with being a bandleader and producer who had a natural instinct for bringing out the best in people and keeping a recording session productive. As the group's producers, Harrison and Lynne directed the sessions, with Harrison often auditioning each member to decide who should sing a particular lead vocal part. The two producers then flew back to England; Lynne recalls that, throughout the flight, he and Harrison enthused about how to turn the sparse, acoustic-based tracks into completed recordings. Harrison described the band's sound as \"skiffle for the 1990s\". Overdubs and further recording took place at Harrison's studio, FPSHOT, with \"Sideburys\" Jim Keltner (drums), Jim Horn (saxophones) and Ray Cooper (percussion). Keltner replaced the drum machine and was eventually credited as Buster Sidebury in a nod to these studio musicians supplementing Nelson (Harrison), Otis (Lynne), Lucky (Dylan), Lefty (Orbison), and Charlie T. Jr. (Petty) Wilbury but with no real names appearing in liner notes or even the songwriting credits. \nThe album was released on 18 October 1988. Distributed by Warner Bros., it appeared on the new Wilbury record label rather than on Harrison's Dark Horse label, in the interests of maintaining the group identity. Over the months following the end of recording in the summer, contractual issues had been successfully negotiated between Warner and the record companies representing Dylan, Petty, Lynne and Orbison. As was the case in 1971 when EMI prepared Harrison's multi-artist live album from the Concert for Bangladesh for release, Dylan's label, Columbia, presented the main stumbling block. In the album credits, the \"Wilburys\" joke was extended further, with the band members listed under the various pseudonyms pretending to be half-brothers \u2013 sons of a fictional Charles Truscott Wilbury Sr. During promotion for the album, Orbison played along with the mock history, saying: \"Some people say Daddy was a cad and a bounder, but I remember him as a Baptist minister.\"\n\"Vol. 1\" was a critical and commercial success, and revitalised the careers of Dylan, Orbison and Petty. As Harrison had intended, the album defied contemporary musical trends such as hip hop, acid house and synthesised pop; author Alan Clayson likens its release to \"a Viking longship docking in a hovercraft terminal\". The album produced two successful singles and went on to achieve triple-platinum certification for sales in the United States. It was nominated for several awards and won the 1990 Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group. Liner notes on the album cover were written by Monty Python's Michael Palin under a pseudonym. Palin's essay was based on an idea by Derek Taylor, who wrote an extensive fictional history of the Wilburys family that otherwise went unused. Harrison planned a feature film about the band, to be produced by HandMade and directed by David Leland, but contractual problems ended the project.\nOrbison's death, \"Nobody's Child\" and \"Vol. 3\".\nRoy Orbison died of a heart attack on 6 December 1988. In tribute to him, the music video for the band's second single, \"End of the Line\", shows a black-and-white framed photo of Orbison, and his guitar is shown, rocking in a chair, whenever his vocals are heard. Lynne recalled that Orbison's death in the wake of \"Vol. 1\"'s success was \"the most sickening thing to me\". He added: \"I was devastated for ages ... Me and Roy had had plans to do much more together, and his voice was in really good shape. It was just so sad for that to happen.\" Although there was speculation in the press that Del Shannon or Roger McGuinn might join the Wilburys, the remaining members never considered replacing Orbison. Lynne later said: \"We'd become this unit, we were all good pals \u2026 We always knew we were going to do another one, and now it's just the four of us.\"\nHarrison was the most active in promoting the Wilburys, carrying out interviews well into 1989. He said he was \"wait[ing] for all the other Wilburys to finish being solo artists\" so that they could renew the collaboration. By contrast, according to author Clinton Heylin, Dylan appeared to give the band little attention as he focused on re-establishing himself as a live performer before recording his 1989 album \"Oh Mercy\".\nIn March 1990, Harrison, Lynne, Petty and Dylan reunited to work on a second Wilburys album, which they intentionally misnumbered \"Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3\". It was preceded by a non-album single, a cover of \"Nobody's Child\", which the band recorded for Olivia Harrison's Romanian Angel Appeal charity project. The duration of the main album sessions was again dictated by Dylan's touring schedule and limited availability. Having asked Dylan to record a lead vocal for all the songs before his departure, Harrison was then loath to replace many of the parts, resulting in a greater prominence for Dylan as a lead singer. Although he ceded his own role as a lead vocalist to Dylan and to Petty, Harrison took over more of the production and contributed more prominently as a lead guitarist than before. Petty described the album as \"a little more rough and ready, a bit more raucous\" than \"Vol. 1\", while Dylan said the new songs were more developed as compositions relative to the \"scraped up from jam tapes\" approach to the band's debut.\n\"Vol. 3\" was released on 29 October 1990. It was dedicated to Orbison, as \"Lefty Wilbury\", the pseudonym that Orbison had used in 1988 in honour of his hero Lefty Frizzell. The album met with less success than the previous one. According to Mo Ostin, the choice of album title came about through \"George being George\"; apparently Harrison was making a wry reference to the appearance of a bootleg that served as a sort of \"Volume 2\". The album's liner notes were written by Eric Idle, another Python member, who again adopted a pseudonym. For the band's final single, \"Wilbury Twist\", they filmed a video in which Idle, John Candy and other comedic actors attempt to master the song's eponymous dance style. The clip was filmed in Los Angeles and completed on 28 February 1991.\nAfter the Wilburys.\nAccording to Jim Keltner, the decision on the group's future after \"Vol. 3\" lay with Harrison. Keltner said that from his conversations with Lynne, Petty and Dylan, they were all keen to reunite, whereas Harrison wavered in his enthusiasm. \nAfter his 1991 tour of Japan \u2013 his first series of concerts since 1974 \u2013 Harrison spoke of a possible Traveling Wilburys tour:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;That would be something I'd like to experience. I've always played around in my own mind what a Wilburys tour could be. Would each person do a solo set and then do Wilburys at the end, or would we all go right on from beginning to end and make everything Wilburys? It's an intriguing thought. We could have a great band up there and the four of us could play acoustic if we wanted to. We could all sing \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and Bob could sing \"Something\". Or we could just sing our individual songs and make them Wilbury tunes, as if we'd recorded them that way. Whatever it was, we could do it.\nThe Wilburys tour never came about. Petty said about the Wilburys touring:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I think it would work, if we wanted to do it. I don't think we ever considered it, really. There were a lot of nights when the conversation would roll around to that. But I don't think anybody ever took it seriously. I think it would ruin it in a way. Then you're obligated to be responsible and it's not in the character of that group. It would make it very formal and that would be the wrong spirit.\nLegacy and influence.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOne of the most amazing things ever about the Wilburys was this poles-apart thing of Roy [Orbison] and Bob Dylan. That's what I thought was wonderful \u2013 the best singer and the best lyricist, and they're both in the same group.\n \u2013 Jeff Lynne\nIn the Rolling Stone Press book \"The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll\", the Traveling Wilburys are described as \"the ultimate supergroup\", with a line-up that represented four eras of rock music history and included \"three indisputable gods\" in Dylan, Harrison and Orbison. The editors also recognise the band as \"the antithesis of a supergroup\", due to the musicians' adoption of fraternal alter egos and the humour inherent in the project. AllMusic managing editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine has similarly written: \"It's impossible to picture a supergroup with a stronger pedigree than that (all that's missing is a Rolling Stone), but in another sense it's hard to call the Wilburys a true supergroup, since they arrived nearly two decades after the all-star craze of the '70s peaked, and they never had the self-important air of nearly all the other supergroups. That, of course, was the key to their charm \u2026\"&lt;ref name=\"Erlewine/AM\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking to music journalist Paul Zollo in 2004, Petty agreed that humour and self-effacement had been key factors in the Wilburys' success, adding: \"We wanted to make something good in a world that seemed to get uglier and uglier and meaner and meaner \u2026 And I'm really proud that I was part of it. Because I do think that it brought a little sunshine into the world.\"\nHarrison said the project was an opportunity to \"put a finger up to the rules\" by challenging the norms associated with the music industry. Discussing the Wilburys in Peter Bogdanovich's 2007 documentary \"Runnin' Down a Dream\", Petty said that one of the strengths behind the concept was that it was free of any intervention from record company, management or marketing concerns, and instead developed naturally from a spirit of co-operation and mutual admiration among five established artists. Author Simon Leng recognises the venture as primarily a channel through which Harrison and Dylan could escape the restrictions of their serious media images, but also, in its guise as a \"phantom band\", a development by Harrison of the Rutles' satirical approach to the Beatles' legacy, in this case by \"de-mythologizing\" rock history.\nInspired by the Traveling Wilburys' success and particularly its benefit to Petty and Orbison as artists, Lenny Waronker encouraged American guitarist Ry Cooder to form the band Little Village and record for Warner Bros. The group \u2013 comprising Cooder, Keltner, John Hiatt and Nick Lowe \u2013 released a self-titled album in 1992. Greg Kot of the \"Chicago Tribune\" described the Notting Hillbillies' \"Missing ... Presumed Having a Good Time\" as a Traveling Wilburys-type side project for Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits. Writing in \"New York\" magazine in late 1990, Elizabeth Wurtzel cited the Notting Hillbillies' album and the self-titled debut by Hindu Love Gods \u2013 a band consisting of Warren Zevon and members of R.E.M. \u2013 as examples of a trend whereby, following the Wilburys' \"Vol. 1\", \"more and more albums seem to be the rock-and-roll equivalents of bowling night.\"\nWriting in \"The Encyclopedia of Popular Music\", Colin Larkin cites the Wilburys' contemporary skiffle as evidence of Lonnie Donegan's continued influence on popular music long after the early 1960s. In his book \"Lonnie Donegan and the Birth of British Rock &amp; Roll\", Patrick Humphries describes the Wilburys as \"a makeshift quintet whose roots were firmly and joyously planted in low-key, low-tech skiffle music\". He credits the band with inspiring a brief revival of Donegan's \"DIY skiffle\", which included Knopfler's Notting Hillbillies. Each member of the Traveling Wilburys has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, although the band itself has not been inducted. Orbison and Dylan were inducted as solo artists, Harrison was inducted as a member of the Beatles and, posthumously, as a solo artist, Petty as the leader of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, and Lynne as a member of the Electric Light Orchestra.\nCatalogue reissue and Genesis Publications book.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe whole experience was some of the best days of my life, really, and I think it probably was for us all ... The thing I guess would be hardest for people to understand is what good friends we were. It really had very little to do with combining a bunch of famous people. It was a bunch of friends that just happened to be really good at making music.\n\u2013 Tom Petty in \"The True History of the Traveling Wilburys\"\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, the two Traveling Wilburys albums had limited availability and were out of print in most areas. Harrison, as primary holder of the rights, did not reissue them before his death. In June 2007, the two albums were reissued as \"The Traveling Wilburys Collection\", a box set including both albums on CD (with bonus tracks) and a DVD featuring a 25-minute documentary entitled \"The True History of the Traveling Wilburys\" and a collection of music videos. The box set was released in three editions: the standard edition, with both CDs and DVD in a double Digipak package and a 16-page booklet; a \"deluxe\" boxed edition with the CDs and DVD and an extensive 40-page booklet, artist postcards, and photographs; or a \"deluxe\" boxed edition on vinyl. This version omits the DVD, but adds a 12-inch vinyl disc with rare versions of the songs.\nThe release debuted at number 1 in the UK and topped the albums chart in Australia, Ireland and other countries. On the US \"Billboard\" 200 it reached number 9. The collection sold 500,000 copies worldwide during the first three weeks and remained in the UK top 5 for seven weeks after its release.\nIn November 2009, Genesis Publications, a company with which Harrison had been associated since the late 1970s, announced the release of a limited edition fine-bound book titled \"The Traveling Wilburys\". Compiled by Olivia Harrison, the book includes rare photographs, recording notes, handwritten lyrics, sketches, and first-hand commentary on the band's history, together with a foreword by Lynne. Petty, Lynne, Olivia Harrison, Barbara Orbison, Keltner and Idle were among those who attended the US launch at a Beverly Hills bookshop in March 2010. In an interview to publicise the book, Lynne expressed his sadness at the deaths of Harrison and Orbison, and reflected: \"The Wilburys was such a wonderful band, such a marvellous thing to be part of.

If the cell grows uncontrollably, it will result in cancer. When a tumor suppressor gene is mutated, it results in a loss or reduction in its function. In combination with other genetic mutations, this could allow the cell to grow abnormally. The loss of function for these genes may be even more significant in the development of human cancers, compared to the activation of oncogenes.\nTSGs can be grouped into the following categories: caretaker genes, gatekeeper genes, and more recently landscaper genes. Caretaker genes ensure stability of the genome via DNA repair and subsequently when mutated allow mutations to accumulate. Meanwhile, gatekeeper genes directly regulate cell growth by either inhibiting cell cycle progression or inducing apoptosis. Lastly, landscaper genes regulate growth by contributing to the surrounding environment, and when mutated, can cause an environment that promotes unregulated proliferation. The classification schemes are evolving as medical advances are being made from fields including molecular biology, genetics, and epigenetics.\nHistory.\nThe discovery of oncogenes and their ability to deregulate cellular processes related to cell proliferation and development appeared first in the literature as opposed to the idea of tumor suppressor genes. However, the idea of genetic mutation leading to increased tumor growth gave way to another possible genetic idea of genes playing a role in decreasing cellular growth and development of cells. This idea was not solidified until experiments by Henry Harris were conducted with somatic cell hybridization in 1969.\nWithin Harris's experiments, tumor cells were fused with normal somatic cells to make hybrid cells. Each cell had chromosomes from both parents and upon growth, a majority of these hybrid cells did not have the capability of developing tumors within animals. The suppression of tumorigenicity in these hybrid cells prompted researchers to hypothesize that genes within the normal somatic cell had inhibitory actions to stop tumor growth. This initial hypothesis eventually lead to the discovery of the first classic tumor suppressor gene by Alfred Knudson, known as the Rb gene, which codes for the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein.\nAlfred Knudson, a pediatrician and cancer geneticist, proposed that in order to develop retinoblastoma, two allelic mutations are required to lose functional copies of both the Rb genes to lead to tumorigenicity. Knudson observed that retinoblastoma often developed early in life for younger patients in both eyes, while in some rarer cases retinoblastoma would develop later in life and only be unilateral. This unique development pattern allowed Knudson and several other scientific groups in 1971 to correctly hypothesize that the early development of retinoblastoma was caused by inheritance of one loss of function mutation to an RB germ-line gene followed by a later de novo mutation on its functional Rb gene allele. The more sporadic occurrence of unilateral development of retinoblastoma was hypothesized to develop much later in life due to two de novo mutations that were needed to fully lose tumor suppressor properties. This finding formed the basis of the two-hit hypothesis. In order to verify that the loss of function of tumor suppressor genes causes increased tumorigenicity, interstitial deletion experiments on chromosome 13q14 were conducted to observe the effect of deleting the loci for the Rb gene. This deletion caused increased tumor growth in retinoblastoma, suggesting that loss or inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene can increase tumorigenicity.\nTwo-hit hypothesis.\nUnlike oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes generally follow the two-hit hypothesis, which states both alleles that code for a particular protein must be affected before an effect is manifested. If only one allele for the gene is damaged, the other can still produce enough of the correct protein to retain the appropriate function. In other words, mutant tumor suppressor alleles are usually recessive, whereas mutant oncogene alleles are typically dominant. \nProposed by A.G. Knudson for cases of retinoblastoma. He observed that 40% of U.S cases were caused by a mutation in the germ-line. However, affected parents could have children without the disease, but the unaffected children became parents of children with retinoblastoma. This indicates that one could inherit a mutated germ-line but not display the disease. Knudson observed that the age of onset of retinoblastoma followed 2nd order kinetics, implying that two independent genetic events were necessary. He recognized that this was consistent with a recessive mutation involving a single gene, but requiring bi-allelic mutation. Hereditary cases involve an inherited mutation and a single mutation in the normal allele. Non-hereditary retinoblastoma involves two mutations, one on each allele. Knudson also noted that hereditary cases often developed bilateral tumors and would develop them earlier in life, compared to non-hereditary cases where individuals were only affected by a single tumor.\nThere are exceptions to the two-hit rule for tumor suppressors, such as certain mutations in the p53 gene product. p53 mutations can function as a dominant negative, meaning that a mutated p53 protein can prevent the function of the natural protein produced from the non-mutated allele. Other tumor-suppressor genes that do not follow the two-hit rule are those that exhibit haploinsufficiency, including PTCH in medulloblastoma and NF1 in neurofibroma. Another example is p27, a cell-cycle inhibitor, that when one allele is mutated causes increased carcinogen susceptibility.\nFunctions.\nThe proteins encoded by most tumor suppressor genes inhibit cell proliferation or survival. Inactivation of tumor suppressor genes therefore leads to tumor development by eliminating negative regulatory proteins. In most cases, tumor suppressor proteins inhibit the same cell regulatory pathways that are stimulated by the products of oncogenes. While tumor suppressor genes have the same main function, they have various mechanisms of action, that their transcribed products perform, which include the following:\nEpigenetic influences.\nExpression of genes, including tumor suppressors, can be altered through biochemical alterations known as DNA methylation. Methylation is an example of epigenetic modifications, which commonly regulate expression in mammalian genes. The addition of a methyl group to either histone tails or directly on DNA causes the nucleosome to pack tightly together restricting the transcription of any genes in this region. This process not only has the capabilities to inhibit gene expression, it can also increase the chance of mutations. Stephen Baylin observed that if promoter regions experience a phenomenon known as hypermethylation, it could result in later transcriptional errors, tumor suppressor gene silencing, protein misfolding, and eventually cancer growth. Baylin et al. found methylation inhibitors known as azacitidine and decitabine. These compounds can actually help prevent cancer growth by inducing re-expression of previously silenced genes, arresting the cell cycle of the tumor cell and forcing it into apoptosis.\nThere are further clinical trials under current investigation regarding treatments for hypermethylation as well as alternate tumor suppression therapies that include prevention of tissue hyperplasia, tumor development, or metastatic spread of tumors. The team working with Wajed have investigated neoplastic tissue methylation in order to one day identify early treatment options for gene modification that can silence the tumor suppressor gene. In addition to DNA methylation, other epigenetic modifications like histone deacetylation or chromatin-binding proteins can prevent DNA polymerase from effectively transcribing desired sequences, such as ones containing tumor suppressor genes.\nClinical significance.\nGene therapy is used to reinstate the function of a mutated or deleted gene type. When tumor suppressor genes are altered in a way that results in less or no expression, several severe problems can arise for the host. This is why tumor suppressor genes have commonly been studied and used for gene therapy. The two main approaches used currently to introduce genetic material into cells are viral and non-viral delivery methods.\nViral methods.\nThe viral method of transferring genetic material harnesses the power of viruses. By using viruses that are durable to genetic material alterations, viral methods of gene therapy for tumor suppressor genes have shown to be successful. In this method, vectors from viruses are used. The two most commonly used vectors are adenoviral vectors and adeno-associated vectors. In vitro genetic manipulation of these types of vectors is easy and in vivo application is relatively safe compared to other vectors. Before the vectors are inserted into the tumors of the host, they are prepared by having the parts of their genome that control replication either mutated or deleted. This makes them safer for insertion. Then, the desired genetic material is inserted and ligated to the vector. In the case with tumor suppressor genes, genetic material which encodes p53 has been used successfully, which after application, has shown reduction in tumor growth or proliferation.\nNon-viral methods.\nThe non-viral method of transferring genetic material is used less often than the viral method. However, the non-viral method is a more cost-effective, safer, available method of gene delivery not to mention that non-viral methods have shown to induce fewer host immune responses and possess no restrictions on size or length of the transferable genetic material. Non-viral gene therapy uses either chemical or physical methods to introduce genetic material to the desired cells. The chemical methods are used primarily for tumor suppressor gene introduction and are divided into two categories which are naked plasmid or liposome-coated plasmids. The naked plasmid strategy has garnered interest because of its easy to use methods. Direct injection into the muscles allows for the plasmid to be taken up into the cell of possible tumors where the genetic material of the plasmid can be incorporated into the genetic material of the tumor cells and revert any previous damage done to tumor suppressor genes. The liposome-coated plasmid method has recently also been of interest since they produce relatively low host immune response and are efficient with cellular targeting. The positively charged capsule in which the genetic material is packaged helps with electrostatic attraction to the negatively charged membranes of the cells as well as the negatively charged DNA of the tumor cells. In this way, non-viral methods of gene therapy are highly effective in restoring tumor suppressor gene function to tumor cells that have either partially or entirely lost this function.\nLimitations.\nThe viral and non-viral gene therapies mentioned above are commonly used but each has some limitations which must be considered. The most important limitation these methods have is the efficacy at which the adenoviral and adeno-associated vectors, naked plasmids, or liposome-coated plasmids are taken in by the host's tumor cells. If proper uptake by the host's tumor cells is not achieved, re-insertion introduces problems such as the host's immune system recognizing these vectors or plasmids and destroying them which impairs the overall effectiveness of the gene therapy treatment further.\nExamples.\nAs the cost of DNA sequencing continues to diminish, more cancers can be sequenced. This allows for the discovery of novel tumor suppressors and can give insight on how to treat and cure different cancers in the future. Other examples of tumor suppressors include pVHL, APC, CD95, ST5, YPEL3, ST7, and ST14, p16, BRCA2.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Using small bombs, they targeted banks, embassies, a BBC Outside Broadcast vehicle, and the homes of Conservative Members of Parliament (MPs). In total, police attributed 25 bombings to the Angry Brigade. The bombings mostly caused property damage; one person was slightly injured. Of the eight people who stood trial, known as the Stoke Newington Eight, four were acquitted. John Barker, along with Hilary Creek, Anna Mendelssohn and Jim Greenfield, were convicted on majority verdicts, and sentenced to ten years. In a 2014 interview, Barker described the trial as political, but acknowledged that \"they framed a guilty man\".\nHistory.\nIn mid-1968 demonstrations took place in London, centred on the US embassy in Grosvenor Square, against US involvement in the Vietnam War. One of the organisers of these demonstrations, Tariq Ali, has said he recalls an approach by someone representing the Angry Brigade who wished to bomb the embassy; he told them it was a terrible idea and no bombing took place.\nThe Angry Brigade decided to launch a bombing campaign with small bombs, in order to maximise media exposure to their demands while keeping collateral damage to a minimum. The campaign started in August 1970 and continued for a year until arrests took place the following summer. Targets included banks, embassies, a BBC Outside Broadcast vehicle earmarked for use in the coverage of the 1970 Miss World event, and the homes of Conservative Members of Parliament (MPs). In total, police attributed 25 bombings to the Angry Brigade. The bombings mostly caused property damage; one person was slightly injured.\nThe Angry Brigade also made two assassination attempts. On 12 January 1971, the brigade attempted to kill British Employment Secretary Robert Carr with two bombs at his home. Although the house suffered severe damage, nobody was killed or injured. A little under four months later, on 4 May 1971, a bomb was attached to the bottom of Lady Beaverbrook's car but it was discovered before it could explode, and disarmed.\nIn the 1980s, the Angry Brigade resurfaced as the Angry Brigade Resistance Movement, part of the Irish Republican Socialist Movement (IRSM).\nTrial.\nJake Prescott, whose origins were in the mining community of Dunfermline, was arrested and tried in 1971. Melford Stevenson sentenced him to 15 years imprisonment (later reduced to 10), mostly spent in Category A high security prisons. Later, Prescott said he realised then that he \"was the one who was angry and the people [he] met were more like the Slightly Cross Brigade\". The other members of the group from north-east London, the \"Stoke Newington Eight\", were prosecuted for carrying out bombings as the Angry Brigade in one of the longest criminal trials of English history (it lasted from 30 May to 6 December 1972). At the conclusion of the trial, John Barker, Jim Greenfield, Hilary Creek and Anna Mendelssohn received prison sentences of 10 years. A number of other defendants were found not guilty, including Stuart Christie, who had previously been imprisoned in Spain for carrying explosives with the intent to assassinate the Spanish dictator General Franco, and Angela Mason who became a director of the LGBT rights group Stonewall and was awarded an OBE for services to homosexual rights.\nIn February 2002, Prescott apologised for his role in bombing Robert Carr's house and called on other members of the Angry Brigade to also come forward.\nPopular culture.\nOn 3 February 2002, \"The Guardian\" reported a history of the Angry Brigade and an update on what its former members were doing then. On 9 August 2002, BBC Radio 4 aired Graham White's historical drama, \"The Trial of the Angry Brigade\". Produced by Peter Kavanagh, this was a reconstruction of the trial combined with other background information. The cast included Kenneth Cranham, Juliet Stevenson, Tom Hiddleston and Mark Strong.\nIn 2009, family care activist and novelist Erin Pizzey won a libel case against Macmillan Publishers after \"Andrew Marr's History of Modern Britain\" had falsely linked her to the Angry Brigade. The publisher also recalled and destroyed the offending version of the book, and republished it with the error removed. The link to the Angry Brigade was made in 2001, in an interview with \"The Guardian\", in which the article states that she was \"thrown out\" of the feminist movement after threatening to inform police about a planned bombing by the Angry Brigade of the clothes shop Biba. \"I said that if you go on with this\u00a0\u2013 they were discussing bombing Biba [the legendary department store in Kensington]\u00a0\u2013 I'm going to call the police in, because I really don't believe in this\".\nThe group and trial feature in Jake Arnott's 2006 novel \"Johnny Come Home\".

The theorem states that each infinite bounded sequence in formula_1 has a convergent subsequence. An equivalent formulation is that a subset of formula_1 is sequentially compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. The theorem is sometimes called the sequential compactness theorem.\nHistory and significance.\nThe Bolzano\u2013Weierstrass theorem is named after mathematicians Bernard Bolzano and Karl Weierstrass. It was actually first proved by Bolzano in 1817 as a lemma in the proof of the intermediate value theorem. Some fifty years later the result was identified as significant in its own right, and proven again by Weierstrass. It has since become an essential theorem of analysis.\nProof.\nFirst we prove the theorem for formula_4 (set of all real numbers), in which case the ordering on formula_4 can be put to good use. Indeed, we have the following result:\nLemma: Every infinite sequence formula_6 in formula_4 has an infinite monotone subsequence (a subsequence that is either non-decreasing or non-increasing).\nProof: Let us call a positive integer-valued index formula_8 of a sequence a \"peak\" of the sequence when formula_9 for every formula_10. Suppose first that the sequence has infinitely many peaks, which means there is a subsequence with the following indices formula_11 and the following terms formula_12. So, the infinite sequence formula_6 in formula_4 has a monotone (non-increasing) subsequence, which is formula_15. But suppose now that there are only finitely many peaks, let formula_16 be the final peak if one exists (let formula_17 otherwise) and let the first index of a new subsequence formula_15 be set to formula_19. Then formula_20 is not a peak, since formula_20 comes after the final peak, which implies the existence of formula_22 with formula_23 and formula_24. Again, formula_22 comes after the final peak, hence there is an formula_26 where formula_27 with formula_28. Repeating this process leads to an infinite non-decreasing subsequence\u00a0 formula_29, thereby proving that every infinite sequence formula_6 in formula_4 has a monotone subsequence.\nNow suppose one has an infinite bounded sequence in formula_4. By the lemma proven above, there exists a monotone subsequence, likewise also bounded. It follows from the monotone convergence theorem that this subsequence converges.\nThe general case in formula_33 can be proven using this lemma as follows. Firstly, we will acknowledge that any sequence formula_34 in formula_33 (where formula_36 denotes its index set) has a convergent subsequence if and only if there exists a countable set formula_37 such that formula_38 converges. Let formula_34 be any bounded sequence in formula_33, then it can be expressed as an n-tuple of sequences in formula_4 by writing formula_42, where formula_43 is a sequence for formula_44. Since formula_45 is bounded, formula_46 is also bounded for formula_47. It follows then by the lemma that formula_48 has a convergent subsequence and hence there exists a countable set formula_49 such that formula_50 converges. For the sequence formula_51, by applying the lemma once again there exists a countable set formula_52 such that formula_53 converges and hence formula_51 has a convergent subsequence. This reasoning may be applied until we obtain a countable set formula_55 for which formula_56 converges for formula_44. Hence, formula_58 converges and therefore, since formula_45 was arbitrary, any bounded sequence in formula_33 has a convergent subsequence.\nAlternative proof over R using nested intervals.\nThere is also an alternative proof of the Bolzano\u2013Weierstrass theorem using nested intervals. We start with a bounded sequence formula_6:\nBecause we halve the length of an interval at each step, the limit of the interval's length is zero. Also, by the \"nested intervals theorem\", which states that if each formula_62 is a closed and bounded interval, say\n formula_63\nwith\n formula_64\nthen under the assumption of nesting, the intersection of the formula_62 is not empty. Thus there is a number formula_66 that is in each interval formula_62. Now we show, that formula_66 is an accumulation point of formula_6.\nTake a neighbourhood formula_70 of formula_66. Because the length of the intervals converges to zero, there is an interval formula_72 that is a subset of formula_70. Because formula_72 contains by construction infinitely many members of formula_6 and formula_76, also formula_70 contains infinitely many members of formula_6. This proves that formula_66 is an accumulation point of formula_6. Thus, there is a subsequence of formula_6 that converges to formula_66.\nSequential compactness in Euclidean spaces.\nDefinition: A set \"formula_83\" is sequentially compact if every sequence \"formula_84\" in \"formula_85\" has a convergent subsequence converging to an element of \"formula_85\".\nTheorem: \"formula_83\" is sequentially compact if and only if \"formula_85\" is closed and bounded.\nProof: (sequential compactness implies closed and bounded)\nSuppose \"formula_85\" is a subset of formula_1 with the property that every sequence in \"formula_85\" has a subsequence converging to an element of \"formula_85\". Then \"formula_85\" must be bounded, since otherwise the following unbounded sequence formula_94 can be constructed. For every formula_95, define formula_96 to be any arbitrary point such that formula_97. Then, every subsequence of formula_84 is unbounded and therefore not convergent. Moreover, \"formula_85\" must be closed, since any limit point of \"formula_85\", which has a sequence of points in \"formula_85\" converging to itself, must also lie in \"formula_85.\"\nProof: (closed and bounded implies sequential compactness)\nSince \"formula_85\" is bounded, any sequence \"formula_104\" is also bounded. From the Bolzano\u2013Weierstrass theorem, \"formula_84\" contains a subsequence converging to some point formula_106. Since formula_66 is a limit point of \"formula_85\" and \"formula_85\" is a closed set, \"formula_66\" must be an element of \"formula_85\".\nThus the subsets \"formula_85\" of formula_1 for which every sequence in \"A\" has a subsequence converging to an element of \"formula_85\" \u2013 i.e., the subsets that are sequentially compact in the subspace topology\u00a0\u2013 are precisely the closed and bounded subsets.\nThis form of the theorem makes especially clear the analogy to the Heine\u2013Borel theorem, which asserts that a subset of formula_1 is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. In fact, general topology tells us that a metrizable space is compact if and only if it is sequentially compact, so that the Bolzano\u2013Weierstrass and Heine\u2013Borel theorems are essentially the same.\nApplication to economics.\nThere are different important equilibrium concepts in economics, the proofs of the existence of which often require variations of the Bolzano\u2013Weierstrass theorem. One example is the existence of a Pareto efficient allocation. An allocation is a matrix of consumption bundles for agents in an economy, and an allocation is Pareto efficient if no change can be made to it that makes no agent worse off and at least one agent better off (here rows of the allocation matrix must be rankable by a preference relation). The Bolzano\u2013Weierstrass theorem allows one to prove that if the set of allocations is compact and non-empty, then the system has a Pareto-efficient allocation.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Proponents typically form the extreme \"nurture\" side of the nature versus nurture debate, arguing that humans are born without any \"natural\" psychological traits and that all aspects of one's personality, social and emotional behaviour, knowledge, or sapience are later imprinted by one's environment onto the mind as one would onto a wax tablet. This idea is the central view posited in the theory of knowledge known as empiricism. Empiricists disagree with the doctrines of innatism or rationalism, which hold that the mind is born already in possession of specific knowledge or rational capacity.\nEtymology.\n\"Tabula rasa\" is a Latin phrase often translated as \"clean slate\" in English and originates from the Roman \"tabula\", a wax-covered tablet used for notes, which was blanked (\"rasa\") by heating the wax and then smoothing it. This roughly equates to the English term \"blank slate\" (or, more literally, \"erased slate\") which refers to the emptiness of a slate prior to it being written on with chalk. Both may be renewed repeatedly, by melting the wax of the tablet or by erasing the chalk on the slate.\nPhilosophy.\nAncient Greek philosophy.\nIn Western philosophy, the concept of \"tabula rasa\" can be traced back to the writings of Aristotle who writes in his treatise \"De Anima\" () of the \"unscribed tablet.\" In one of the more well-known passages of this treatise, he writes that:\nHaven't we already disposed of the difficulty about interaction involving a common element, when we said that mind is in a sense potentially whatever is thinkable, though actually it is nothing until it has thought? What it thinks must be in it just as characters may be said to be on a writing tablet on which as yet nothing stands written: this is exactly what happens with mind. \nThis idea was further evolved in Ancient Greek philosophy by the Stoic school. Stoic epistemology emphasizes that the mind starts blank, but acquires knowledge as the outside world is impressed upon it. The doxographer Aetius summarizes this view as \"When a man is born, the Stoics say, he has the commanding part of his soul like a sheet of paper ready for writing upon.\" Diogenes La\u00ebrtius attributes a similar belief to the Stoic Zeno of Citium when he writes in \"Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers\" that: \nPerception, again, is an impression produced on the mind, its name being appropriately borrowed from impressions on wax made by a seal; and perception they divide into comprehensible and incomprehensible: Comprehensible, which they call the criterion of facts, and which is produced by a real object, and is, therefore, at the same time conformable to that object; Incomprehensible, which has no relation to any real object, or else, if it has any such relation, does not correspond to it, being but a vague and indistinct representation.\nIbn Sina (11th century).\nIn the 11th century, the theory of \"tabula rasa\" was developed more clearly by Ibn Sina. He argued that the \"human intellect at birth resembled a \"tabula rasa\", a pure potentiality that is actualized through education and comes to know.\" Thus, according to Ibn Sina, knowledge is attained through \"empirical familiarity with objects in this world from which one abstracts universal concepts,\" which develops through a \"syllogistic method of reasoning; observations lead to propositional statements, which when compounded lead to further abstract concepts.\" He further argued that the intellect itself \"possesses levels of development from the static/material intellect, that potentiality can acquire knowledge to the active intellect, the state of the human intellect at conjunction with the perfect source of knowledge.\"\nIbn Tufail (12th century).\nIn the 12th century, the Andalusian-Islamic philosopher and novelist, Ibn Tufail (known as Abubacer or Ebn Tophail in the West) demonstrated the theory of \"tabula rasa\" as a thought experiment through his Arabic philosophical novel, \"Hayy ibn Yaqdhan\", in which he depicts the development of the mind of a feral child \"from a tabula rasa to that of an adult, in complete isolation from society\" on a desert island, through experience alone.\nThe Latin translation of his philosophical novel, entitled \"Philosophus Autodidactus\", published by Edward Pococke the Younger in 1671, had an influence on John Locke's formulation of \"tabula rasa\" in \"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\".\nAquinas (13th century).\nIn the 13th century, St. Thomas Aquinas brought the Aristotelian and Avicennian notions to the forefront of Christian thought. These notions sharply contrasted with the previously-held Platonic notions of the human mind as an entity that pre-existed somewhere in the heavens, before being sent down to join a body here on Earth (cf. Plato's \"Phaedo\" and \"Apology\", as well as others). St. Bonaventure (also 13th century) was one of the fiercest intellectual opponents of Aquinas, offering some of the strongest arguments toward the Platonic idea of the mind.\nDescartes (17th century).\nDescartes, in his work \"The Search for Truth by Natural Light\", summarizes an empiricist view in which he uses the words \"table rase\", in French; in the following English translation, this was rendered \"tabula rasa\":\nAll that seems to me to explain itself very clearly if we compare children's imagination to a \"tabula rasa\" on which our ideas, which resemble portraits of each object taken from nature, should depict themselves. The senses, the inclinations, our masters and our intelligence, are the various painters who have the power to execute this work; and amongst them, those who are least adapted to succeed in it, i.e., the imperfect senses, blind instinct, and foolish nurses, are the first to mingle themselves with it. There finally comes the best of all, intelligence, and yet it is still requisite for it to have an apprenticeship of several years, and to follow the example of its masters for long, before daring to rectify a single one of their errors. In my opinion this is one of the principal causes of the difficulty we experience in attaining to true knowledge. For our senses really perceive that alone which is most coarse and common; our natural instinct is entirely corrupted; and as to our masters, although there may no doubt be very perfect ones found amongst them, they yet cannot force our minds to accept their reasoning before our understanding has examined it, for the accomplishment of this end pertains to it alone. But it is like a clever painter who might have been called upon to put the last touches on a bad picture sketched out by prentice hands, and who would probably have to employ all the rules of his art in correcting little by little first a trait here, then a trait there, and finally be required to add to it from his own hand all that was lacking, and who yet could not prevent great faults from remaining in it, because from the beginning the picture would have been badly conceived, the figures badly placed, and the proportions badly observed.\nLocke (17th century).\nThe modern idea of the theory is attributed mostly to John Locke's expression of the idea in \"Essay Concerning Human Understanding\", particularly using the term \"white paper\" in Book II, Chap. I, 2. In Locke's philosophy, \"tabula rasa\" was the theory that at birth the (human) mind is a \"blank slate\" without rules for processing data, and that data is added and rules for processing are formed solely by one's sensory experiences. The notion is central to Lockean empiricism; it serves as the starting point for Locke's subsequent explication (in Book II) of simple ideas and complex ideas.\nAs understood by Locke, \"tabula rasa\" meant that the mind of the individual was born blank, and it also emphasized the freedom of individuals to author their own soul. Individuals are free to define the content of their character\u2014but basic identity as a member of the human species cannot be altered. This presumption of a free, self-authored mind combined with an immutable human nature leads to the Lockean doctrine of \"natural\" rights. Locke's idea of \"tabula rasa\" is frequently compared with Thomas Hobbes's viewpoint of human nature, in which humans are endowed with inherent mental content\u2014particularly with selfishness.\nFreud (19th century).\nThe concept of \"Tabula rasa\" can be constructed from Sigmund Freud's psychoanalysis. Freud argued that the psyche was largely formed by socialization, not biology or genealogy. (see Oedipus complex). In Freud's schema of psycho-sexual development, the conflicting drives imprinted by the parents (the id versus the superego) produce ego, and that in spite of his neuroses, the analysand would discuss matters in a non-adversarial manner. The clinician would simply pose questions to the patient about his neuroses. Exposure to such questions would inculcate the patient's secondary defenses against the neuroses, helping him shed 'substitutive satisfactions,' sadomasochism. Freud's theories implied that humans are largely products of their socialization. In Freudian psychoanalysis, ones' neuroses are agitated until transference neuroses are projected onto the psychoanalyst. Freud posited the individual as a blank slate with an imprint of regressive characteristics through socialization.\nScience.\nPsychology and neurobiology.\nPsychologists and neurobiologists have shown evidence that initially, the entire cerebral cortex is programmed and organized to process sensory input, control motor actions, regulate emotion, and respond reflexively (under predetermined conditions). These programmed mechanisms in the brain subsequently act to learn and refine the ability of the organism.\nPsychological research has shown that \u2014 in contrast to written language \u2014 the brain is \"hard-wired\" at birth to acquire spoken language, something argued by both psychologist Steven Pinker and by the universal grammar theory of Noam Chomsky.\nThere have been claims by a minority in psychology and neurobiology, however, that the brain is \"tabula rasa\" only for certain behaviours. For instance, with respect to one's ability to acquire both general and special types of knowledge or skills, Michael Howe argued against the existence of innate talent. There also have been neurological investigations into specific learning and memory functions, such as Karl Lashley's study on mass action and serial interaction mechanisms.\nImportant evidence against the \"tabula rasa\" model of the mind comes from behavioural genetics, especially twin and adoption studies (see below). These indicate strong genetic influences on personal characteristics such as IQ, alcoholism, gender identity, and other traits. Critically, multivariate studies show that the distinct faculties of the mind, such as memory and reason, fractionate along genetic boundaries. Cultural universals such as emotion and the relative resilience of psychological adaptation to accidental biological changes also support basic biological mechanisms in the mind.\nSocial pre-wiring hypothesis.\nTwin studies have resulted in important evidence against the \"tabula rasa\" model of the mind, specifically, of social behaviour. The \"social pre-wiring\" \"hypothesis\" (also informally known as \"wired to be social\") refers to the ontogeny of social interaction. The theory questions whether there is a propensity to socially oriented action already present \"before\" birth. Research in the theory concludes that newborns are born into the world with a unique genetic wiring to be social.\nCircumstantial evidence supporting the social pre-wiring hypothesis can be revealed when examining newborns' behaviour. Newborns, not even hours after birth, have been found to display a preparedness for social interaction. This preparedness is expressed in ways such as their imitation of facial gestures. This observed behaviour cannot be attributed to any current form of socialization or social construction. Rather, newborns most likely inherit to some extent social behaviour and identity through genetics.\nPrincipal evidence for this theory is uncovered by examining twin pregnancies. The main argument is, if there are social behaviours that are inherited and developed before birth, then one should expect twin fetuses to engage in some form of social interaction before they are born. Thus, ten fetuses were analyzed over a period of time using ultrasound techniques. Using kinematic analysis, the results of the experiment were that the twin fetuses would interact with each other for longer periods and more often as the pregnancies went on. Researchers were able to conclude that the performance of movements between the co-twins were not accidental but specifically aimed.\nThe social pre-wiring hypothesis was proven correct:The central advance of this study is the demonstration that 'social actions' are already performed in the second trimester of gestation. Starting from the 14th week of gestation twin fetuses plan and execute movements specifically aimed at the co-twin. These findings force us to predate the emergence of social behaviour: when the context enables it, as in the case of twin fetuses, other-directed actions are not only possible but predominant over self-directed actions.\nComputer science.\nIn artificial intelligence, \"tabula rasa\" refers to the development of autonomous agents with a mechanism to reason and plan toward their goal, but no \"built-in\" knowledge-base of their environment. Thus, they truly are a blank slate.\nIn reality, autonomous agents possess an initial data-set or knowledge-base, but this cannot be immutable or it would hamper autonomy and heuristic ability. Even if the data-set is empty, it usually may be argued that there is a built-in bias in the reasoning and planning mechanisms. Either intentionally or unintentionally placed there by the human designer, it thus negates the true spirit of \"tabula rasa\".\nA synthetic (programming) language parser (LR(1), LALR(1) or SLR(1), for example) could be considered a special case of a \"tabula rasa\", as it is designed to accept \"any\" of a possibly infinite set of source language programs, within a \"single\" programming language, and to output either a good parse of the program, or a good machine language translation of the program, either of which represents a \"success\", or, alternately, a \"failure\", and nothing else. The \"initial data-set\" is a set of tables which are generally produced mechanically by a parser table generator, usually from a BNF representation of the source language, and represents a \"table representation\" of that \"single\" programming language.\nAlphaZero achieved superhuman performance in chess and shogi using self-play and \"tabula rasa\" reinforcement learning, meaning it had no access to human games or hard-coded human knowledge about either board game, only the rules of the games.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The word is used in the West to refer to a specific type of Japanese straight, double-edged sword used in antiquity (as opposed to curved, single-edged swords such as the katana). In Japanese the term \"tsurugi\" or \"ken\" () is used as a term for all sorts of international long, double-edged swords.\nHistory.\nThe term \"tsurugi\" (\u5263) designates a straight, double-edged, bladed weapon from Japan. It is a sword with two cutting edges, one on each side of its blade, unlike the \"tachi\", \"katana\", \"wakizashi\", or \"odachi\", which have only one cutting edge on one side of the blade.\nThe oldest bronze sword excavated in Japan is a Chinese style dagger from around 800 BC in the Yayoi period (1000 BC \u2013 300 AD). A large number of bronze \"tsurugi\" made around 200 B.C. in the Yayoi period were excavated from several sites, and it is thought that \"tsurugi\" were mass-produced in Japan in this period. Bronze \"tsurugi\" of this period were mainly used for religious services. The Yayoi period was the transition period from bronze to iron. However, the iron \"tsurugi\" were usually forged from the 5th century (Kofun period) to the 9th century (Heian period). \nFrom the 10th century, the development of the curved \"tachi\" began, from which the \"katana\" emerged. For a long time, \"tsurugi\" were made as weapons or for religious services, but after the 10th century, they completely disappeared as weapons and came to be made only as offerings to Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples. One of the most famous \"tsurugi\" is the one made in the Heian period (794\uff0d1185) owned by Kong\u014d-ji and stored by Kyoto National Museum. It is made to imitate the sword \"Fudo My\u014d\u014d\" holds in his right hand, and the hilt is in the shape of a vajra, a Buddhist altar tool.\nNowadays it is mainly associated with very remote historical times, as well as legends and mythology. There are some similarities with some variants of Chinese \"jian\" (called \"chugokuken\" (\u4e2d\u56fd\u5263) in Japanese).\n\"Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi\".\nThe most famous example is the legendary sword \"Kusanagi no Tsurugi\" which is one of the Three Imperial Regalia of Japan.\n\"Tsurugi-tachi\".\nThe \"tsurugi-tachi\" (\u5263\u592a\u5200), a straight sword with only one side of the blade sharpened throughout, was similar to the \"tsurugi\" or \"ken\". The other (back) side was only worked into a second cutting edge in the front part near the tip.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31217", "revid": "248739", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31217", "title": "Typography", "text": "Art of arranging type\nTypography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable and appealing when displayed. The arrangement of type involves selecting typefaces, point sizes, line lengths, line spacing, letter spacing, and spaces between pairs of letters. The term \"typography\" is also applied to the style, arrangement, and appearance of the letters, numbers, and symbols created by the process. Type design is a closely related craft, sometimes considered part of typography; most typographers do not design typefaces, and some type designers do not consider themselves typographers. Typography also may be used as an ornamental and decorative device, unrelated to the communication of information.\nTypography is also the work of graphic designers, art directors, manga artists, comic book artists, and, now, anyone who arranges words, letters, numbers, and symbols for publication, display, or distribution, from clerical workers and newsletter writers to anyone self-publishing materials. Until the Digital Age, typography was a specialized occupation. Personal computers opened up typography to new generations of previously unrelated designers and lay users. As the capability to create typography has become ubiquitous, the application of principles and best practices developed over generations of skilled workers and professionals has diminished.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"typography\" in English derives from the Greek roots 'type' + 'writing'.\nHistory.\nAlthough typically applied to printed, published, broadcast, and reproduced materials in contemporary times, all words, letters, symbols, and numbers written alongside the earliest naturalistic drawings by humans may be called typography. The word \"typography\" is derived from the Greek words \u03c4\u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 \"typos\" 'form' or \"impression\" and \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \"graphein\" 'to write', and traces its origins to the first punches and dies used to make seals and currency in ancient times, which ties the concept to printing. The uneven spacing of the impressions on brick stamps found in the Mesopotamian cities of Uruk and Larsa, dating from the second millennium BC, may be evidence of type, wherein the reuse of identical characters was applied to create cuneiform text. Babylonian cylinder seals were used to create an impression on a surface by rolling the seal on wet clay. Typography was also implemented in the Phaistos Disc, an enigmatic Minoan printed item from Crete, which dates to between 1850 and 1600 BC. It has been proposed that Roman lead pipe inscriptions were created with movable type printing, but German typographer Herbert Brekle recently dismissed this view.\nThe essential criterion of type identity was met by medieval print artifacts such as the Latin Pruefening Abbey inscription of 1119 that was created by the same technique as the Phaistos Disc. The silver altarpiece of patriarch Pellegrinus II (1195\u20131204) in the cathedral of Cividale was printed with individual letter punches. Apparently, the same printing technique may be found in tenth- to twelfth-century Byzantine reliquaries. Other early examples include individual letter tiles where the words are formed by assembling single letter tiles in the desired order, which were reasonably widespread in medieval Northern Europe.\nTypography with movable type was invented during the eleventh-century Song dynasty in China by Bi Sheng (990\u20131051). His movable type system was manufactured from ceramic materials, and clay type printing continued to be practiced in China until the Qing dynasty.\nWang Zhen was one of the pioneers of wooden movable type. Although the wooden type was more durable under the mechanical rigors of handling, repeated printing wore the character faces down and the types could be replaced only by carving new pieces.\nMetal movable type was first invented in Korea during the Goryeo, c. 1230. Hua Sui introduced bronze type printing to China in 1490. The diffusion of both movable-type systems was limited and the technology did not spread beyond East and Central Asia, however.\nModern lead-based movable type, along with the mechanical printing press, is most often attributed to the goldsmith Johannes Gutenberg in 1439. His type pieces, made from a lead-based alloy, suited printing purposes so well that the alloy is still used today. Gutenberg developed specialized techniques for casting and combining cheap copies of letter punches in the vast quantities required to print multiple copies of texts. This technical breakthrough was instrumental in starting the Printing Revolution and the first book printed with lead-based movable type was the Gutenberg Bible.\nRapidly advancing technology revolutionized typography in the latter twentieth century. During the 1960s some camera-ready typesetting could be produced in any office or workshop with stand-alone machines such as those introduced by IBM, such as its Selectric typewriter. During the same period Letraset introduced dry transfer technology that allowed designers to transfer types instantly. The famous Lorem Ipsum gained popularity due to its usage in Letraset. During the mid-1980s personal computers allowed type designers to create typefaces digitally using commercial graphic design software such as Fontographer. Digital technology also enabled designers to create more experimental typefaces as well as the practical typefaces of traditional typography. Designs for typefaces could be created faster with the new technology, and for more specific functions. The cost for developing typefaces was drastically lowered, becoming widely available to the masses. The change has been called the \"democratization of type\" and has given new designers more opportunities to enter the field.\nEvolution.\nThe design of typefaces has developed alongside the development of typesetting systems. Although typography has evolved significantly from its origins, it is a largely conservative art that tends to cleave closely to tradition. This is because legibility is paramount, and so the typefaces that are the most readable usually are retained. In addition, the evolution of typography is inextricably intertwined with lettering by hand and related art forms, especially formal styles, which thrived for centuries preceding typography, and so the evolution of typography must be discussed with reference to this relationship.\nIn the nascent stages of European printing, the typeface (blackletter, or Gothic) was designed in imitation of the popular hand-lettering styles of scribes. Initially, this typeface was difficult to read, because each letter was set in place individually and made to fit tightly into the allocated space. The art of manuscript writing, the origin of which was during Hellenistic and Roman bookmaking, reached its zenith in the illuminated manuscripts of the Middle Ages. Metal typefaces notably altered the style, making it \"crisp and uncompromising\", and also brought about \"new standards of composition\".\nDuring the Renaissance period in France, Claude Garamond was partially responsible for the adoption of Roman typeface that eventually supplanted the more commonly used Gothic (blackletter). Roman typeface also was based on hand-lettering styles.\nThe development of Roman typeface can be traced back to Greek lapidary letters. Greek lapidary letters were carved into stone and \"one of the first formal uses of Western letterforms\"; after that, Roman lapidary letterforms evolved into the monumental capitals, which laid the foundation for Western typographical design, especially serif typefaces. There are two styles of Roman typefaces: the old style, and the modern. The former is characterized by its similarly weighted lines, while the latter is distinguished by its contrast of light and heavy lines. Often, these styles are combined.\nIn relation to the international graphics of the 1920s - 1930s, the term \"International Typographic Style\" is used. In the 1950s - 1960s, such a phenomenon as \"Swiss style\" was formed in typography.\nBy the twentieth century, computers turned typeface design into a rather simplified process. This has allowed the number of typefaces and styles to proliferate exponentially, as there now are thousands available. Confusion between typeface and font (the various styles of a single typeface) occurred in 1984 when Steve Jobs mislabeled typefaces as fonts for Apple computers and his error has been perpetuated throughout the computer industry, leading to common misuse by the public of the term \"font\" when \"typeface\" is the proper term.\nExperimental typeface uses.\n\"Experimental typography\" is defined as the unconventional and more artistic approach to typeface selection. Francis Picabia was a Dada pioneer of this practice in the early twentieth century. David Carson is often associated with this movement, particularly for his work in \"Ray Gun\" magazine in the 1990s. His work caused an uproar in the design community due to his abandonment of standard practices in typeface selection, layout, and design. Experimental typography is said to place emphasis on expressing emotion, rather than having a concern for legibility while communicating ideas, hence considered bordering on being art.\nTechniques.\nThere are many facets to the expressive use of typography, and with those come many different techniques to help with visual aid and the graphic design. Spacing and kerning, size-specific spacing, x-height and vertical proportions, character variation, width, weight, and contrast are several techniques that are necessary to be taken into consideration when thinking about the appropriateness of specific typefaces or creating them. When placing two or more differing and/or contrasting fonts together, these techniques come into play for organizational strategies and demanding attractive qualities. For example, if the bulk of a title has a more unfamiliar or unusual font, simpler sans-serif fonts will help complement the title while attracting more attention to the piece as a whole.\nScope.\nIn contemporary use, the practice and study of typography include a broad range, covering all aspects of letter design and application, both mechanical (typesetting, type design, and typefaces) and manual (handwriting and calligraphy). Typographical elements may appear in a wide variety of situations, including:\nSince digitization, typographical uses have spread to a wider range of applications, appearing on web pages, LCDs, mobile phone screens, and hand-held video games.\nText typefaces.\nTraditionally, text is \"composed\" to create a readable, coherent, and visually satisfying block of type that works invisibly, without the awareness of the reader. Even distribution of typeset material, with a minimum of distractions and anomalies, aims to produce clarity and transparency.\nChoice of typefaces is the primary aspect of text typography\u2014prose fiction, non-fiction, editorial, educational, religious, scientific, spiritual, and commercial writing all have differing characteristics and requirements of appropriate typefaces (and their fonts or styles). For historic material, established text typefaces frequently are chosen according to a scheme of historical \"genre\" acquired by a long process of accretion, with considerable overlap among historical periods.\nContemporary books are more likely to be set with state-of-the-art \"text romans\" or \"book romans\" typefaces with serifs and design values echoing present-day design arts, which are closely based on traditional models such as those of Nicolas Jenson, Francesco Griffo (a punchcutter who created the model for Aldine typefaces), and Claude Garamond. With their more specialized requirements, newspapers and magazines rely on compact, tightly fitted styles of text typefaces with serifs specially designed for the task, which offer maximum flexibility, readability, legibility, and efficient use of page space. Sans serif text typefaces (without serifs) often are used for introductory paragraphs, incidental text, and whole short articles. A fashion at the end of the twentieth century was to pair a sans-serif typeface for headings with a high-performance serif typeface of matching style for the text of an article.\nTypesetting conventions are modulated by orthography and linguistics, word structures, word frequencies, morphology, phonetic constructs and linguistic syntax. Typesetting conventions also are subject to specific cultural conventions. For example, in French it is customary to insert a non-breaking space before a colon (:) or semicolon (;) in a sentence, while in English it is not.\nColor.\nIn typesetting, \"color\" is the overall density of the ink on the page, determined mainly by the typeface, but also by the word spacing, leading, and depth of the margins. Text layout, tone, or color of the set text, and the interplay of text with the white space of the page in combination with other graphic elements impart a \"feel\" or \"resonance\" to the subject matter. With printed media, typographers also are concerned with binding margins, paper selection, and printing methods when determining the correct color of the page.\nPrinciples of the typographic craft.\nThree fundamental aspects of typography are \"legibility\", \"readability\", and \"aesthetics\". Although in a non-technical sense \"legible\" and \"readable\" are often used synonymously, typographically they are separate but related concepts. Legibility and readability tend to support aesthetic aspects of a product.\n\"Legibility\" describes how easily individual characters can be distinguished from one another. It is described by Walter Tracy as \"the quality of being decipherable and recognisable\". For instance, if a \"b\" and an \"h\", or a \"3\" and an \"8\", are difficult to distinguish at small sizes, this is a problem of legibility. Typographers are concerned with legibility insofar as it is their job to select the correct font to use. Brush script is an example of a font containing many characters that might be difficult to distinguish. The selection of cases influences the legibility of typography because using only uppercase letters (all-caps) reduces legibility.\n\"Readability\" refers to how easy it is to read the text as a whole, as opposed to the individual character recognition described by legibility. Use of margins, word and line spacing, and clear document structure all impact readability. Some fonts or font styles, for instance sans-serif fonts, are considered to have low readability and so are unsuited for large quantities of prose.\nLegibility \"refers to perception\" (being able to see as determined by physical limitations of the eye), and readability \"refers to comprehension\" (understanding the meaning). Good typographers and graphic designers aim to achieve excellence in both.\n\"The typeface chosen should be legible. That is, it should be read without effort. Sometimes legibility is simply a matter of type size; more often, however, it is a matter of typeface design. Case selection always influences legibility. In general, typefaces that are true to the basic letterforms are more legible than typefaces that have been condensed, expanded, embellished, or abstracted.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nStudies of both legibility and readability have examined a wide range of factors including type size and type design, comparing serif vs. sans-serif type, roman type vs. \"oblique type\" and \"italic type\", line length, line spacing, color contrast, the design of right-hand edge (for example, justification, straight right hand edge) vs. ragged right, and whether text is hyphenated. Justified copy must be adjusted tightly during typesetting to prevent loss of readability, something beyond the capabilities of typical personal computers.\nLegibility is usually measured through the speed of reading, with comprehension scores used to check for effectiveness (that is, not a rushed or careless read). For example, Miles Tinker, who published numerous studies from the 1930s to the 1960s, used a speed of reading test that required participants to spot incongruous words as an effectiveness filter.\nThe \"Readability of Print Unit\" at the Royal College of Art under Professor Herbert Spencer with Brian Coe and Linda Reynolds did important work in this area. It was one of the centers that revealed the importance of the saccadic rhythm of eye movement for readability\u2014in particular, the ability to take in (i.e., recognise the meaning of groups of) about three words at once and the physiognomy of the eye, which means the eye tires if the line required more than three or four of these saccadic jumps. More than this is found to introduce strain and errors in reading (e.g., doubling). The use of all-caps renders words indistinguishable as groups, all letters presenting a uniform line to the eye, requiring special effort for separation and understanding.\nCurrently, legibility research tends to be limited to critical issues or the testing of specific design solutions (for example, when new typefaces are developed). Examples of critical issues include typefaces for people with visual impairment, typefaces and case selection for highway and street signs, or for other conditions where legibility may make a key difference.\nMuch of the legibility research literature is atheoretical\u2014various factors were tested individually or in combination (inevitably so, as the different factors are interdependent), but many tests lacked a model of reading or visual perception. Some typographers believe that the overall word shape (Bouma) is essential in readability and that the theory of parallel letter recognition is wrong, less important, or not the entire picture. Word shape differs by outline, influenced by ascending and descending elements of lowercase letters and enables reading the entire word without having to parse out each letter.\nReadability also may be compromised by letter-spacing, word spacing, or leading that is too tight or too loose. It may be improved when generous vertical space separates text lines, making it easier for the eye to distinguish one line from the next, or previous line. Poorly designed typefaces and those that are too tightly or loosely fitted also may be less legible. Underlining also may reduce readability by eliminating the recognition effect contributed by the descending elements of letters.\nPeriodical publications, especially newspapers and magazines, use typographical elements to achieve an attractive, distinctive appearance, to aid readers in navigating the publication, and in some cases for dramatic effect. By formulating a style guide, a publication or periodical standardizes with a relatively small collection of typefaces, each used for specific elements within the publication, and makes consistent use of typefaces, case, type sizes, italic, boldface, colors, and other typographic features such as combining large and small capital letters together. Some publications, such as \"The Guardian\" and \"The Economist\", go so far as to commission a type designer to create customized typefaces for their exclusive use.\nDifferent periodicals design their publications, including their typography, to achieve a particular tone or style. For example, \"USA Today\" uses a bold, colorful, and comparatively modern style through their use of a variety of typefaces and colors; type sizes vary widely, and the newspaper's name is placed on a colored background. In contrast, \"The New York Times\" uses a more traditional approach, with fewer colors, less typeface variation, and more columns.\nEspecially on the front page of newspapers and on magazine covers, headlines often are set in larger display typefaces to attract attention, and are placed near the masthead.\n\"Typography utilized to characterize text:\" Typography is intended to reveal the character of the text. Through the use of typography, a body of text can instantaneously reveal the mood the author intends to convey to its readers. The message that a body of text conveys has a direct relationship with the typeface that is chosen. Therefore, when a person focuses on typography and setting type, they must pay very close attention to the typeface they choose. Choosing the correct typeface for a body of text can only be done after thoroughly reading the text, understanding its context, and understanding what the text is wishing to convey. Once the typographer has an understanding of the text, then they have the responsibility of using the appropriate typeface to honor the writing done by the author of the text. Knowledge required to choose the correct typeface comes with understanding the historical background of typefaces and understanding the reason that typeface was created. For example, if the text is titled \"Commercial Real Estate Transactions\" and elaborates on the real estate market throughout the body, then the appropriate typeface is a serif typeface, because the author intends to inform his audience on a serious topic and not entertain his audience with an anecdote; a serif typeface would convey a sense of seriousness to the audience instantaneously. The typographer would also employ larger type for the title to convey its importance, which directly informs the reader of the structure in which the text is intended to be read, and increases readability from varying distances.\n\"Typography utilized to make reading practical:\" Typography not only must honor the tone of the text but also share the responsibility of making the audience commence reading and sustaining the audience's attention throughout the text. Although typography can potentially attract the reader's attention and create a beautiful/attractive piece of text, the craft of typography is not limited to the aesthetic appeal of the text. On the contrary, the object of typography is to make the reading experience practical and useful. Bold colors, multiple typefaces, and colorful backgrounds in a typographic design may be eye-catching; however, it may not be appropriate for all bodies of text and could potentially make text illegible. Overuse of design elements such as colors and typefaces can be unsettling, preventing the text from conveying its message to readers. A study from 2020 found that the participating subjects felt music sounded \"more pleasant\" when the CD cover featured round typeface.\nDisplay graphics.\nType may be combined with negative space and images, forming relationships and dialog between the words and images for special effects. Display designs are a potent element in graphic design. Some sign designers exhibit less concern for readability, sacrificing it for an artistic manner. Color and size of type elements may be much more prevalent than in solely text designs. Most display items exploit type at larger sizes, where the details of letter design are magnified. Color is used for its emotional effect in conveying the tone and nature of subject matter.\nDisplay typography encompasses:\nAdvertising.\nTypography has long been a vital part of promotional material and advertising. Designers often use typefaces to set a theme and mood in an advertisement (for example, using bold, large text to convey a particular message to the reader). Choice of typeface is often used to draw attention to a particular advertisement, combined with efficient use of color, shapes, and images. In the early twenty-first century, typography in advertising often reflects a company's brand.\nA brand may use typography to express its theme, personality, and message. Just by looking at the typeface, viewers can get an idea about the message and personality of the brand, which the brands are fully aware of and are tapping into the power of good typography.\nTypefaces used in advertisements convey different messages to the reader: classical ones are for a strong personality, while more modern ones may convey clean, neutral look. Bold typefaces are used for making statements and attracting attention. In any design, a balance has to be achieved between the visual impact and communication aspects. Digital technology in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries has enabled the creation of typefaces for advertising that are more experimental than traditional typefaces.\nInscriptional and architectural lettering.\nThe history of inscriptional lettering is intimately tied to the history of writing, the evolution of letterforms and the craft of the hand. The widespread use of the computer and various etching and sandblasting techniques today has made the hand carved monument a rarity, and the number of letter-carvers left in the US continues to dwindle.\nFor monumental lettering to be effective, it must be considered carefully in its context. Proportions of letters need to be altered as their size and distance from the viewer increases. An expert monument designer gains understanding of these nuances through much practice and observation of the craft. Letters drawn by hand and for a specific project have the possibility of being richly specific and profoundly beautiful in the hand of a master. Each also may take up to an hour to carve, so it is no wonder that the automated sandblasting process has become the industry standard.\nDigital typography.\nWhilst the principles of good typography remain into the digital age, new tools are available to the typographer. Digital character encoding means that the presentation of text is independent of the meaning of that text; thus the same text can be used readily in different contexts but using different typefaces as appropriate to each context. Typographers have moved beyond the static pages of print books, newspapers, posters and other display materials, into design of dynamic materials such as web pages (see Web typography).\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

For this reason, classes employing templated methods place the implementation in the headers (*.h files) as no symbol could be compiled without knowing the type beforehand.\nThe C++ Standard Library provides many useful functions within a framework of connected templates.\nMajor inspirations for C++ templates were the parameterized modules provided by the language CLU and the generics provided by Ada.\nTechnical overview.\nThere are three kinds of templates: \"function templates\", \"class templates\" and, since C++14, \"variable templates\". Since C++11, templates may be either variadic or non-variadic; in earlier versions of C++ they are always non-variadic.\nC++ Templates are Turing complete.\nFunction templates.\nA \"function template\" behaves like a function except that the template can accept arguments of various types, enabling type-generic behavior (see example). In other words, a function template represents a family of functions. The format for declaring function templates with type parameters is:\ntemplate &lt;class Identifier&gt; Declaration;\ntemplate &lt;typename Identifier&gt; Declaration;\nBoth expressions have the same meaning and behave in exactly the same way. The latter form was introduced to avoid confusion, since a type parameter need not be a class until C++20. (It can be a basic type such as codice_1 or codice_2.)\nFor example, the C++ Standard Library contains the function template codice_3 which returns the larger of codice_4 and codice_5. That function template could be defined like this:\ntemplate &lt;typename T&gt;\nnodiscard\nconstexpr T&amp; max(const T&amp; a, const T&amp; b) noexcept {\n return a &lt; b ? b : a;\nThis single function definition works with many data types. Specifically, it works with all data types for which &lt; (the less-than operator) is defined and returns a value with a type convertible to codice_6. The usage of a function template saves space in the source code file in addition to limiting changes to one function description and making the code easier to read.\nAn instantiated function template usually produces the same object code, though, compared to writing separate functions for all the different data types used in a specific program. For example, if a program uses both an codice_1 and a codice_2 version of the codice_9 function template above, the compiler will create an object code version of codice_9 that operates on codice_1 arguments and another object code version that operates on codice_2 arguments. The compiler output will be identical to what would have been produced if the source code had contained two separate non-templated versions of codice_9, one written to handle codice_1 and one written to handle codice_2.\nHere is how the function template could be used:\nimport std;\nint main() {\n // This will call max&lt;int&gt; by implicit argument deduction.\n std::println(\"{}\", std::max(3, 7));\n // This will call max&lt;double&gt; by implicit argument deduction.\n std::println(\"{}\", std::max(3.0, 7.0));\n // We need to explicitly specify the type of the arguments; \n // although std::type_identity could solve this problem...\n std::println(\"{}\", max&lt;double&gt;(3, 7.0));\nIn the first two cases, the template argument codice_16 is automatically deduced by the compiler to be codice_1 and codice_2, respectively. In the third case automatic deduction of codice_19 would fail because the type of the parameters must in general match the template arguments exactly. Therefore, we explicitly instantiate the codice_2 version with codice_21.\nThis function template can be instantiated with any copy-constructible type for which the expression codice_22 is valid. For user-defined types, this implies that the less-than operator (codice_23) must be overloaded in the type.\nAbbreviated function templates.\nSince C++20, using codice_24 or codice_25 in any of the parameters of a function declaration, that declaration becomes an \"abbreviated function template\" declaration. Such a declaration declares a function template and one invented template parameter for each placeholder is appended to the template parameter list:\nvoid f1(auto); // same as template &lt;class T&gt; void f1(T)\nvoid f2(C1 auto); // same as template &lt;C1 T&gt; void f2(T), if C1 is a concept\nvoid f3(C2 auto...); // same as template &lt;C2... Ts&gt; void f3(Ts...), if C2 is a concept\nvoid f4(C2 auto, ...); // same as template &lt;C2 T&gt; void f4(T...), if C2 is a concept\nvoid f5(const C3 auto*, C4 auto&amp;); // same as template &lt;C3 T, C4 U&gt; void f5(const T*, U&amp;);\nConstraining the codice_9 using concepts could look something like this:\nusing std::totally_ordered;\n// in typename declaration:\ntemplate &lt;totally_ordered T&gt;\nnodiscard\nconstexpr T max(T x, T y) noexcept {\n return x &lt; y ? y : x;\n// in requires clause:\ntemplate &lt;typename T&gt;\n requires totally_ordered&lt;T&gt;\nnodiscard\nconstexpr T max(T x, T y) noexcept {\n return x &lt; y ? y : x;\nClass templates.\nA class template provides a specification for generating classes based on parameters. Class templates are generally used to implement containers. A class template is instantiated by passing a given set of types to it as template arguments. The C++ Standard Library contains many class templates, in particular the containers adapted from the Standard Template Library, such as codice_27.\nVariable templates.\nIn C++14, templates can be also used for variables, as in the following example:\ntemplate &lt;typename T&gt; \nconstexpr T PI = T{3.141592653589793238462643383L}; // (Almost) from std::numbers::pi\nNon-type template parameters.\nAlthough templating on types, as in the examples above, is the most common form of templating in C++, it is also possible to template on values. Thus, for example, a class declared with\ntemplate &lt;int K&gt;\nclass MyClass;\ncan be instantiated with a specific codice_1.\nAs a real-world example, the standard library fixed-size array type codice_29 is templated on both a type (representing the type of object that the array holds) and a number which is of type codice_30 (representing the number of elements the array holds). To create a class codice_31 equivalent to codice_32, it can be declared as follows:\ntemplate &lt;class T, size_t N&gt; \nstruct Array;\nand an array of six codice_33s might be declared:\nArray&lt;char, 6&gt; myArray;\nTemplate specialization.\nWhen a function or class is instantiated from a template, a specialization of that template is created by the compiler for the set of arguments used, and the specialization is referred to as being a generated specialization.\nExplicit template specialization.\nSometimes, the programmer may decide to implement a special version of a function (or class) for a given set of template type arguments which is called an explicit specialization. In this way certain template types can have a specialized implementation that is optimized for the type or a more meaningful implementation than the generic implementation.\nExplicit specialization is used when the behavior of a function or class for particular choices of the template parameters must deviate from the generic behavior: that is, from the code generated by the main template, or templates. For example, the template definition below defines a specific implementation of codice_9 for arguments of type codice_35:\nimport std;\ntemplate &lt;&gt; \nnodiscard\nconstexpr const char* max(const char* a, const char* b) noexcept {\n // Normally, the result of a direct comparison\n // between two C strings is undefined behaviour;\n // using std::strcmp makes defined.\n return std::strcmp(a, b) &gt; 0 ? a : b;\nVariadic templates.\nC++11 introduced variadic templates, which can take a variable number of arguments in a manner somewhat similar to variadic functions such as codice_36.\nusing std::format_string;\nusing std::ofstream;\nenum class Level { ... };\nofstream logFile{\"logfile.txt\"};\ntemplate &lt;typename... Args&gt;\nvoid log(const format_string&lt;Args...&gt;&amp; fmt, Args&amp;&amp;... args) {\n std::println(logFile, fmt, args...);\nBecause only C-style variadic parameters are supported in C++, the only way to get type-safe variadic functions (like in Java is through variadic templates.\nTemplate aliases.\nC++11 introduced template aliases, which act like parameterized typedefs.\nThe following code shows renaming codice_37 to codice_38 and codice_39 to codice_40, as well as creating an alias codice_41 for codice_42. This allows, for example, codice_43 to be used as shorthand for codice_44.\nusing String = std::string;\n// allowing optional specialization of hash functions, allocators, etc.\ntemplate &lt;\n typename K, \n typename V, \n typename Compare = std::less&lt;K&gt;, \n typename Alloc = std::allocator&lt;std::pair&lt;const K, T\u00bb\nusing TreeMap = std::map&lt;K, V, Compare, Alloc&gt;;\ntemplate &lt;\n typename K, \n typename V, \n typename HashFn = std::hash&lt;K&gt;, \n typename KeyEq = std::equal_to&lt;K&gt;, \n typename Alloc = std::allocator&lt;std::pair&lt;const K, T\u00bb\nusing HashMap = std::unordered_map&lt;K, V, HashFn, KeyEq, Alloc&gt;;\n// or, only allowing K and V to be specialized:\ntemplate &lt;typename K, typename V&gt;\nusing TreeMap = std::map&lt;K, V&gt;;\ntemplate &lt;typename K, typename V&gt; \nusing HashMap = std::unordered_map&lt;K, V&gt;;\n// Defining StringHashMap&lt;K&gt; = HashMap&lt;K, String&gt;\ntemplate &lt;typename K&gt;\nusing StringHashMap = HashMap&lt;K, String&gt;;\nStringHashMap&lt;int&gt; myMap = /* something here... */;\nConstrained templates.\nSince C++20, templates can be constrained similarly to generics wildcards in Java or C# and Rust codice_45 clauses. This is done using concepts, which represent a set of boolean predicates evaluated at compile time.\nFor example, this code defines a concept representing an upper bound on inheritance. A class satisfies this concept if it inherits from codice_46, and classes that do not cannot be used as the template parameter in codice_47.\nimport std;\nusing std::is_base_of_v;\nusing std::vector;\nclass Player {\n};\ntemplate &lt;typename T&gt;\nconcept ExtendsPlayer = is_base_of_v&lt;Player, T&gt;;\n// T is required to be a type whose inheritance upper bound is Player,\n// blocking any type that does not inherit from Player\ntemplate &lt;ExtendsPlayer T&gt;\nvoid processListOfPlayers(vector&lt;T&gt; players) {\nExported templates.\nIn C++03, \"exported templates\" were added to C++. These were later removed in C++11, due to very few compilers actually supporting the feature. The only compiler known to support exported templates was Comeau C/C++. Among the cited reasons for removal were:\nAn \"exported template\" is essentially a class template whose static data members and non-inline methods are exported. It must be marked by the keyword codice_48. What distinguishes an \"exported template\" is the fact that it does not need to be defined in a translation unit that uses the template. For example (in C++03):\nFile1.cpp:\nstatic void trace() {\n std::cout \u00ab \"File 1\" \u00ab std::endl;\nexport template &lt;typename T&gt;\nT min(const T&amp; x, const T&amp; y);\nint main() {\n trace();\n std::cout \u00ab min(2, 3) \u00ab std::endl;\nFile2.cpp:\nstatic void trace() {\n std::cout \u00ab \"File 2\" \u00ab std::endl;\nexport template &lt;typename T&gt;\nT min(const T&amp; x, const T&amp; y) {\n trace();\n return a &lt; b ? a : b;\nWith the introduction of modules in C++20, the keyword codice_48 was re-added to C++. This re-allowed declarations like this:\nimport std;\nusing std::is_base_of_v;\nexport class Atom {\n};\nexport template &lt;typename T&gt;\nconcept ExtendsAtom = is_base_of_v&lt;Atom, T&gt;;\nexport template &lt;ExtendsAtom Instance, typename... Bases&gt;\nclass Cluster: public Bases... {\nprivate:\n Instance x;\npublic:\n explicit Cluster(Instance x, Bases&amp;&amp;... bases):\n};\nThe compilation speed benefits intended to be offered by exported templates are offered by modules anyway, making the feature essentially obsolete and superseded by modules.\nGeneric programming features in other languages.\nInitially, the concept of templates was not included in some languages, such as Java and C# 1.0. Java's adoption of generics mimics the behavior of templates, but is technically different. C# added generics (parameterized types) in .NET 2.0. The generics in Ada predate C++ templates.\nAlthough C++ templates, Java generics, and .NET generics are often considered similar, generics only mimic the basic behavior of C++ templates. Some of the advanced template features utilized by libraries such as Boost and STLSoft, and implementations of the STL, for template metaprogramming (explicit or partial specialization, default template arguments, template non-type arguments, template template arguments, ...) are unavailable with generics.\nIn C++ templates, compile-time cases were historically performed by pattern matching over the template arguments. For example, the template base class in the Factorial example below is implemented by matching 0 rather than with an inequality test, which was previously unavailable. However, the arrival in C++11 of standard library features such as std::conditional has provided another, more flexible way to handle conditional template instantiation.\n// Induction\ntemplate &lt;unsigned int N&gt; \nstruct Factorial {\n static constexpr unsigned int value = N * Factorial&lt;N - 1&gt;::value;\n// Base case via template specialization:\ntemplate &lt;&gt; \nstruct Factorial&lt;0&gt; {\n static constexpr unsigned int value = 1;\nWith these definitions, one can compute, say 6! at compile time using the expression codice_50.\nAlternatively, codice_51 in C++11 / codice_52 in C++17 can be used to calculate such values directly using a function at compile-time:\ntemplate &lt;unsigned int N&gt;\nnodiscard\nconstexpr unsigned int factorial() noexcept {\n if constexpr (N &lt;= 1) {\n return 1;\n } else {\n return N * factorial&lt;N - 1&gt;();\nBecause of this, template meta-programming is now mostly used to do operations on types.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As ruler of the combined Gothic realms, Theodoric controlled an empire stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Adriatic Sea. Though Theodoric himself only used the title 'king' (\"rex\"), some scholars characterize him as a Western Roman emperor in all but name, since he ruled a large part of the former Western Roman Empire. He also received and used the former Western imperial regalia from Constantinople in 497, and exercised imperial powers recognized in the East, such as naming consuls. The Italian aristocracy referred to him using the imperial title \"princeps\" .\nAs a young child of an Ostrogothic nobleman, Theodoric was taken as a hostage to Constantinople, where he spent his formative years and received an East Roman education (\"paideia\"). Theodoric returned to Pannonia around 470, and throughout the 470s he campaigned against the Sarmatians and competed for influence among the Goths of the Roman Balkans, gaining recognition as king in 471. The emperor Zeno made him commander of the Eastern Roman forces in 483 and consul in 484. Nevertheless, Theodoric remained in constant hostilities with the emperor and frequently raided East Roman territory.\nAt the behest of Zeno, in 489 Theodoric attacked Odoacer, the king of Italy, emerging victorious in 493. As the new ruler of Italy, he upheld a Roman legal administration and scholarly culture while promoting a major building program across Italy. In 505 he expanded into the Balkans, and by 511 he had brought the Visigothic Kingdom of Spain under his direct control and established hegemony over the Burgundian and Vandal kingdoms. Theodoric died in 526 and was buried in a grand mausoleum in Ravenna. He lived on as the figure Dietrich von Bern in Germanic heroic legend.\nName.\nTheodoric's name was Gothic, and it is reconstructed by linguists as \"*\u00deiudareiks\", meaning \"people-king\" or \"ruler of the people\". Contemporary sources give his name as Latin (), although there were also many variants of the spelling.\nYouth and early exploits.\nAccording to the 6th-century writer Jordanes, Theodoric was born at the same time that the Ostrogoths defeated their previous overlords the Huns, after the death of their ruler Attila in 453. The Ostrogoths had already established themselves in Pannonia, south of the Danube, in an area which had been controlled by the Huns, and before that had been within the Roman empire. Modern scholars believe this defeat of the Huns probably occurred about 454. Jordanes says that the territory of Theodoric's father Theodemir was near \"Lake Pelso\" (), which was either the Neusiedler See or Lake Balaton, which both lie near modern Vienna and Budapest. Theodemir was a member of the Amal dynasty, and Theodoric's mother was the king's concubine, Ereleuva. Historian Hans-Ulrich Wiemer states that, \"Theodoric\u2019s childhood was spent at a time of violent conflicts between non-Roman groups attempting to fill the power vacuum created by the collapse of Attila\u2019s empire\". \nIn 461, when Theodoric was seven or eight years of age, he was taken hostage in Constantinople to secure the Ostrogoths' compliance with a treaty Theodemir had concluded with the \"Augustus\" Leo I (ruled 457\u2013474). Under the terms of the treaty, the Pannonian Goths were required to \"surrender a hostage of royal descent\" to the emperor's court; in this case that hostage was Theodoric. The treaty also secured a payment to Constantinople of some 300 pounds' worth of gold each year. Theodoric was well educated by Constantinople's best teachers. His status made him valuable, since the Amal family from which he came (as told by Theodoric), allegedly ruled half of all Goths since the third century. Historian Peter Heather argues that Theodoric's claims were likely self-aggrandizing propaganda and that the Amal dynasty was more limited than modern commentators presume. Until 469, Theodoric remained in Constantinople where he spent formative years\u2014ten years in total\u2014\"catching up on all the \"Romanitas\"\" it had taken generations of Visigothic Balthi to acquire. Theodoric was treated with favor by the emperor Leo I. He learned to read, write and perform arithmetic while in captivity in the Eastern Empire.\nWhen Leo heard that his imperial army was retreating from the Goths near Pannonia, he sent Theodoric home with gifts and no promises of any commitments. On his return in 469/470, Theodoric assumed leadership over the Gothic regions previously ruled by his uncle, Valamir, while his father became king, ruling together. Not long afterwards near Singidunum (modern Belgrade) in upper Moesia, the Tisza Sarmatian king Babai had extended his authority at Constantinople's expense. Legitimizing his position as a warrior, Theodoric crossed the Danube with six thousand warriors, defeated the Sarmatians and killed Babai; this moment likely crystallized his position and marked the beginning of his kingship, despite not actually having yet assumed the throne. Perhaps to assert his authority as an Amali prince, Theodoric kept the conquered area of Singidunum for himself.\nThroughout the 470s, sometimes in the name of the empire itself, Theodoric launched campaigns against potential Gothic rivals and other enemies of the Eastern Empire, which made him an important military and political figure. One of his chief rivals was the chieftain of the Thracian Goths Theodoric Strabo (Strabo means \"the Squinter\"), who had led a major revolt against the emperor Zeno. Finding common ground with the emperor, Theodoric was rewarded by Zeno and made commander of East Roman forces, while his people became \"foederati\" or federates of the Roman army. In 471, Theodoric was recognized as King of the Ostrogoths by 6,000 Goths that had previously rebelled against the Hunnic ruler Dengizich in 467\u2013468.\nZeno attempted to play one Germanic chieftain against another and take advantage of an opportunity sometime in 476/477 when\u2014after hearing demands from Theodoric for new lands since his people were facing a famine\u2014he offered Theodoric Strabo the command once belonging to Theodoric. Enraged by this betrayal, Theodoric turned his wrath against the communities in the Rhodope Mountains, where his forces commandeered livestock and slaughtered peasants, sacked and burned Stobi in Macedonia and requisitioned supplies from the archbishop at Heraclea. Gothic plundering finally elicited a settlement from Zeno, but Theodoric initially refused any compromise. Theodoric sent one of his confidants, Sidimund, forward to Epidaurum for negotiations with Zeno. While the Roman envoy and Theodoric were negotiating, Zeno sent troops against some of Theodoric's wagons, which were under the protection of his able general Theodimund. Unaware of this treachery, Theodoric's Goths lost around 2,000 wagons and 5,000 of his people were taken captive.\nTheodoric settled his people in Epirus in 479 with the help of his relative Sidimund. In 482, he raided Greece and sacked Larissa. Bad luck, rebellions and poor decisions left Zeno in an unfortunate position, which subsequently led him to seek another agreement with Theodoric. In 483, Zeno made Theodoric \"magister militum praesentalis\" and consul designate in 484, whereby he commanded the Danubian provinces of Dacia Ripensis and Moesia Inferior as well as the adjacent regions.\nReign.\nSeeking further gains, Theodoric frequently ravaged the provinces of the Eastern Roman Empire, eventually threatening Constantinople itself. By 486, there was little disputing the open hostilities between Theodoric and Zeno. The emperor sought the assistance of the Bulgars, who were likewise defeated by Theodoric. In 487, Theodoric began his aggressive campaign against Constantinople, blockading the city, occupying strategically important suburbs, and cutting off its water supply; although it seems Theodoric never intended to occupy the city but instead, to use the assault as a means of gaining power and prestige from the Eastern Empire.\nThe Ostrogoths needed a place to live and Zeno was having serious problems with Odoacer\u2014the Germanic \"foederatus\" and King of Italy\u2014who although ostensibly viceroy for Zeno, was menacing Byzantine territory and not respecting the rights of Roman citizens in Italy. In 488/489, Zeno ordered Theodoric to overthrow Odoacer; the former stopped issuing coins in the emperor's name and \"raised his son Thela to the position of Caesar.\" For this task, Theodoric received support from Rugian king Frideric, the son of his cousin Giso. Theodoric then moved with his people towards Italy in the autumn of 488. On the way he was opposed by the Gepids, whom he defeated at Sirmium in August 489. Arriving in Italy, Theodoric won the battles of Isonzo and Verona in 489.\nOnce again, Theodoric was pressed by Zeno in 490 to attack Odoacer. Theodoric's army was defeated by Odoacer's forces at Faenza in 490, but regained the upper hand after securing victory in the Battle of the Adda River on 11 August 490. For several years, the armies of Odoacer and Theodoric vied for supremacy across the Italian peninsula. Theodoric besieged Odoacer in Ravenna until 2 February 493, when a treaty was signed making the kings joint rulers of Italy. Theodoric entered Ravenna on 5 March 493, and a banquet celebrating the treaty was organized on 15 March. At this feast, Theodoric, after making a toast, drew his sword and struck Odoacer, splitting him in two from collarbone to thigh. Theodoric had the king's most loyal followers slaughtered as well, making him the master of Italy.\nWith Odoacer dead and his forces dispersed, Theodoric now faced the problem of settlement for his people. Concerned about thinning out the Amal line too much, Theodoric believed he could not afford to spread some 40,000 of his tribesmen across the entire Italian peninsula. Such considerations led him to the conclusion that it was best to settle the Ostrogoths in three concentrated areas: around Pavia, Ravenna and Picenum. Theodoric's kingdom was among the most \"Roman\" of the barbarian states and he successfully ruled most of Italy for thirty-three years following his treachery against Odoacer. He visited Rome in 500 where he stayed for 6 months and held games in the Circus, probably also in the Colosseum, and renewed the grain largesse to the Roman populace, which had perhaps been interrupted since the days of Odoacer. \nTheodoric's settlement policy involved granting Gothic warriors land in Italy through a modified version of the Roman \"hospitalitas\" system. According to Wiemer, this provided a means of rewarding Gothic loyalty while avoiding wholesale confiscation of Roman estates. However, it also entrenched social divisions and created enduring tensions.\nTheodoric extended his hegemony over the Burgundian and Vandal kingdoms (along with Visigothic royals) through marriage alliances. He had married the sister of the mighty Frankish king, Clovis\u2014likely in recognition of Frankish power. He sent a substantial dowry accompanied by a guard of 5,000 troops with his sister Amalafrida when she married the king of the Vandals and Alans, Thrasamund. These policies aimed to position Theodoric as the senior monarch among the western barbarian kings. In 504\u2013505, Theodoric extended his realms in the Balkans by defeating the Gepids, acquiring the province of Pannonia. Theodoric became regent for the infant Visigothic king, his grandson Amalaric, following the defeat of Alaric II by the Franks under Clovis in 507. The Franks were able to wrest control of Aquitaine from the Visigoths, but otherwise Theodoric was able to defeat their incursions.\nIn 511, the Visigothic Kingdom was brought under Theodoric's direct control, forming a Gothic superstate that extended from the Atlantic to the Danube. While territories that were lost to the Franks remained that way, Theodoric concluded a peace arrangement with the heirs of the Frankish Kingdom once Clovis was dead. Additional evidence of the Gothic king's extensive royal reach include the acts of ecclesiastical councils that were held in Tarragona and Gerona; while both occurred in 516 and 517, they date back to the \"regnal years of Theoderic, which seem to commence in the year 511\".\nLike Odoacer, Theodoric was ostensibly only a viceroy for the \"augustus\" in Constantinople, but he nonetheless adopted the trappings of imperial style, increasingly emphasizing his \"neo-imperial status\". According to historian Peter Brown, Theodoric was in the habit of commenting that \"An able Goth wants to be like a Roman; only a poor Roman would want to be like a Goth.\" Much like the representatives of the Eastern Empire, Theodoric chose to be clad in robes dyed purple, emulating the imperial colors and perhaps even to reinforce the imperial dispatch of the \"augustus\" Anastasius I, which outlined Theodoric's position as an imperial colleague. Chroniclers like Cassiodorus added a layer of legitimacy for Theodoric and the Amal tribe from which he came by casting them as cooperative participants in the greater history of the Mediterranean dating back to the era of Alexander the Great. Though he did not adopt the title \"Imperator\", Theodoric employed many of the ceremonial and symbolic forms associated with Roman emperors, including triumphal entries (\"adventus\"), and formal addresses to the people (\"adlocutio\") of Rome. Wiemer argues that this ceremonial adoption of imperial norms served to legitimize Theodoric\u2019s rule in the eyes of Roman elites. In reality\u2014at least in part due to his formidable military\u2014he was able to avoid imperial supervision, and dealings between the emperor and Theodoric were as equals. Unlike Odoacer, however, Theodoric respected the agreement he had made and allowed Roman citizens within his kingdom to be subject to Roman law and the Roman judicial system. The Goths, meanwhile, lived under their own laws and customs. Theodoric preserved legal distinctions between Goths and Romans by maintaining separate legal traditions. Roman subjects continued to be governed by Roman law, while Gothic military settlers operated under Gothic customary law. This legal bifurcation, according to Wiemer, was central to Theodoric\u2019s vision of coexistence and order in his kingdom. Historian Hans-Ulrich Wiemer characterizes Theodoric's rule as based on a principle of \u201cintegration through separation,\u201d whereby the Ostrogoths and the Roman population maintained distinct legal and cultural spheres. While Goths served primarily in military roles under their own legal codes, the Roman population continued to be governed by Roman law and staffed the civil administration. This dual structure allowed Theodoric to preserve ethnic identities while ensuring administrative stability in Italy. In 519, when a mob had burned down the synagogues of Ravenna, Theodoric ordered the town to rebuild them at its own expense.\nTheodoric experienced difficulties before his death. He had married off his daughter Amalasuintha to the Visigoth Eutharic, but Eutharic died in August 522 or 523, so no lasting dynastic connection of Ostrogoths and Visigoths was established, which highlighted the tensions between the Eastern Empire and the West. The new \"augustus\", Justin I\u2014who replaced Anastasius, a man with whom Theodoric had good relations\u2014was under the influence of his nephew Justinian; somehow, imperial views hardened against the West and talk of Rome's fall emerged during this period, leading to questions about the legitimacy of barbarian rule. \nTheodoric's good relations with the Roman Senate deteriorated due to a presumed senatorial conspiracy in 522, and, in 523, Theodoric had the philosopher and court official Boethius and Boethius' father-in-law Symmachus arrested on charges of treason related to the alleged plot. For his ostensible role, Theodoric had Boethius executed in 524. Although Theodoric initially promoted religious toleration between Arian Goths and Catholic Romans, tensions escalated in the final years of his reign. The arrest and execution of the Roman senator Boethius on charges of treason marked a turning point. In some ways, this event reflects Theodoric\u2019s increasing political paranoia and declining trust in the Roman aristocracy.\nDespite the complex relationship between Theodoric and his son-in-law, the Catholic Burgundian king Sigismund, the two enjoyed a mutual peace for fifteen years. Then in 522, Sigismund killed his own son\u2014Theodoric's grandson\u2014Sigeric; an act which infuriated Theodoric and he retaliated by invading the Burgundian kingdom, accompanied by the Franks. Between the two peoples, Sigismund's Burgundian forces faced two fronts and were defeated. Meanwhile, Sigismund's Arian brother Godomar established himself as king over the remaining Burgundian territory and ruled for a decade.\nWhen Theodoric's sister Amalafrida sought to possibly change the direction of Vandal succession following the death of her spouse, the former Vandal king Thrasamund, the new Catholic Vandal king Hilderic had her, along with the accompanying Gothic retinue, killed. Theodoric was incensed and planned an expedition to restore his power over the Vandal kingdom when he died of dysentery in the summer of 526. The Gothic king was succeeded by his grandson Athalaric, with Theodoric's daughter Amalasuintha serving as regent since Athalaric was but ten years of age when Theodoric died. Her role was to carry out the dead ruler's political testament, to seek accommodation with the senate, and maintain peace with the emperor. Suddenly the once united Goths were split and Theodoric's grandson Amalaric ruled the newly independent Visigothic kingdom for the next five years.\nFamily and progeny.\nTheodoric was married once. He had a concubine in Moesia, name unknown, with whom he had two daughters:\nBy his marriage in 493 to the pagan Audofleda\u2014the sister of Clovis, who was baptized an Arian at the time of their wedding\u2014Theodoric had one daughter:\nAfter his death in Ravenna in 526, Theodoric was succeeded by his grandson Athalaric. Athalaric was at first represented by his mother Amalasuintha, who served as regent between 534 and 535. The kingdom of the Ostrogoths, however, began to wane and the personal union of the Gothic tribes, once brought together by Theodoric, collapsed following his demise. The subsequent campaigns into Italy by Justinian\u2014whose long reign from 527 to 565 delineates the transition from \"antiquity to the Middle Ages in the Latin West\" according to historian Michael Kulikowski\u2014wrought the final blows to Theodoric's once dominant kingdom.\nBuilding program.\nTheodoric promoted the rebuilding of Roman cities and the preservation of ancient monuments in Italy. In 500, Rome itself was given special attention by Theodoric, who wanted to restore the structures previously damaged by time and the barbarians alike, since as he mused, Rome's great buildings were witness to its grandeur, power, and thereto instructed his architects to restore all that was \"ancient\". His preservation efforts were designed to elicit awe and admiration in future generations. The fame of Theodoric's building works reached far-away Syria. In the aggregate, Theodoric's building program saw more extensive new construction and restoration than that of any of the West Roman emperors after Honorius (395\u2013423).\nRavenna.\nTheodoric devoted most of his architectural attention to his capital, Ravenna. He restored Ravenna's water supply by repairing an aqueduct originally built by Trajan. According to the chronicles of Cassiodorus, a number of cities were renewed by Theodoric's building enterprises, some of which even surpassed the ancient wonders. Historian Jonathan J. Arnold quips:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Northern cities like Ravenna, Verona, Pavia, Milan, Parma, Como, Aquileia, and still others received new or improved walls, palaces, aqueducts, churches, baths, and a host of other impressive and glorious buildings, all reiterating to their respective inhabitants their own importance within a newly revived and reinvigorated Roman Empire and connecting such ideas with the intervention of a caring and devoted \"princeps\", Theodoric.\n He constructed a \"Great Basilica of Hercules\" next to a colossal statue of the hero himself. To promote Arianism, the king commissioned a small Arian cathedral, the \"Hagia Anastasis\", which contains the Arian Baptistery. Three more churches built by Theodoric in Ravenna and its suburbs, S. Andrea dei Goti, S. Giorgio and S. Eusebio, were destroyed in the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries. Theodoric built the Palace of Theodoric for himself in Ravenna, modeled on the Great Palace of Constantinople. It was an expansion of an earlier Roman structure. The palace church of Christ the Redeemer survives and is known today as the Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo. It was Theodoric's personal church of worship and was modeled specifically according to his tastes. An equestrian statue of Theodoric was erected in the square in front of the palace. Statues like these were symbols of the ancient world, and Theodoric's equestrian likeness was meant to convey his status as the undisputed ruler of the western empire.\nTheodoric the Great was interred in Ravenna, but his bones were scattered and his mausoleum was converted to a church after Belisarius conquered the city in 540. His mausoleum is considered one of the finest monuments in Ravenna and a significant court monument of the Roman Empire's early successor states. Unlike all the other contemporary buildings in Ravenna, which were made of brick, the Mausoleum of Theodoric was built completely from fine quality stone ashlars. Possibly as a reference to the Goths' tradition of an origin in Scandinavia, the architect decorated the frieze with a pattern found in 5th- and 6th-century Scandinavian metal adornments.\nRome.\nThe Palace of Domitian on the Palatine Hill was reconstructed, using the receipts from a specially levied tax; while the city walls of Rome were rebuilt, a feat celebrated by the Senate of Rome with a gilded statue of Theodoric. The Senate's Curia, the Theatre of Pompey, the city aqueducts, sewers and a granary were refurbished and repaired and statues were set up in the Flavian Amphitheatre.\nReligion.\nIn 522 the philosopher Boethius became his \"magister officiorum\" (head of all the government and court services). Boethius was a Roman aristocrat and Christian humanist, who was also a philosopher, poet, theologian, mathematician, astronomer, translator and commentator on Aristotle and other Greek luminaries. It is hard to overestimate this one-time servant and eventual victim of Theodoric for his influence on philosophy, particularly Christian philosophy, throughout the Middle Ages. Boethius' treatises and commentaries became textbooks for medieval students, and the great Greek philosophers were unknown except for his Latin translations. The execution of Boethius did nothing to dissipate tensions between Arians and Catholics but merely raised additional questions about barbarian imperial legitimacy. \nTheodoric was of the Arian (nontrinitarian) faith, and in his final years he was no longer the disengaged Arian patron of religious toleration that he had seemed earlier in his reign. \"Indeed, his death cut short what could well have developed into a major persecution of Catholic churches in retaliation for measures taken by Justinian in Constantinople against Arians there.\"\nDespite the Byzantine \"caesaropapism\", which conflated imperial and ecclesiastical authority in the same person\u2014whereby Theodoric's Arian beliefs were tolerated under two separate emperors\u2014the fact remained that to most clergy across the Eastern Empire, Theodoric was a heretic. At the end of his reign quarrels arose with his Roman subjects and the Byzantine emperor Justin I over the matter of Arianism. These quarrels ultimately led to the death of Boethius and Pope John I in 524 and 526, respectively. Relations between the two realms deteriorated, although Theodoric's military abilities dissuaded the Byzantines from waging war against him. After his death, that reluctance faded quickly.\nLegacy.\nSeeking to restore the glory of ancient Rome, Theodoric ruled Italy during one of its most peaceful and prosperous periods and was accordingly hailed as a new Trajan and Valentinian I for his building efforts and his religious toleration. His far-sighted goals included taking what was best from Roman culture and combining it with Gothic energy and physical power as a way into the future. Much like Odoacer before him, historian Ian Wood avowed that Theodoric was \"effectively a Roman ruler, albeit one whose authority depended on his barbarian following\"; although Gregory of Tours later reported Theodoric \"as king of Italy and not king of the Goths.\" \nPerhaps this can be attributed to the fact that relatively amicable relations between Goths and Romans were maintained throughout Theodoric's term of rule. \nIn terms of the early successor states' legacy following the Roman West's collapse, Ian Wood commented: \nContinuity of political ideology and organisational practice is clearest for Italy under Theodoric, which is not surprising, for he effectively took over what had been the central imperial bureaucracy, as can be seen in the \"Variae\" of Cassiodorus. Other rulers inherited the administrative offices of West Roman provinces, together with the authority of military officials, although they also imitated the style of imperial rulership. \nWhile historian John Julius Norwich, describing the lasting greatness of the Ostrogoth and former king of Italy, wrote:\nNo other Germanic ruler, setting up his throne on the ruins of the Western Empire, possessed a fraction of his statesmanship and political vision; and when he died ... Italy lost the greatest of her early medieval rulers, unequalled until the days of Charlemagne.\nMemories of Theodoric's reign made him a hero of medieval German legends, as Dietrich von Bern, where the two figures have represented the same person.\nMedieval reception and misuse.\nTheodoric is an important figure in Germanic heroic legend as the character \"Dietrich von Bern\" (), known in Old Norse as \"\u00dej\u00f3\u00f0rekr\" or \"\u00dei\u00f0rekr\", and Old English as \"\u00de\u0113odr\u012bc\". In German legends, Dietrich becomes an exile from his native kingdom of Lombardy, fighting with the help of Etzel against his usurping uncle, Ermenrich. Only the Old High German \"Hildebrandslied\" still contains Odoacer () as Dietrich's antagonist. The 13th century Norse \u00dei\u00f0reks saga, based on lost Low German sources, moves the location of Dietrich's life to Westphalia and northern Germany. The legends paint a generally positive picture of Dietrich, with only some influence visible from the negative traditions of the church.\nBeyond the appropriation of Theodoric\u2019s legacy for medieval legends, his namesake and exploits were also seized upon in various nationalist contexts, particularly in 19th- and 20th-century Germany. For their politico-ideological purposes, historians and ideologues recast Theodoric as a prototypical Germanic hero, emphasizing his supposed racial and cultural purity. During the Nazi era, he was celebrated as a model of Germanic leadership and correspondingly used in state propaganda.\nModern historiographical debate.\nThere is an ongoing debate among modern historians as to how qualify the nature of power Theodoric wielded in his domains. Traditionalists have argued for some time that Theodoric was a Germanic king, citing as their frame of reference later Byzantine sources\u2014written during the Gothic war\u2014that brand him as a barbarian king, who merely mimicked Roman customs. One scholar, Jonathan J. Arnold, advocates that this nature changed during the course of the 6th century; Arnold alludes to local and contemporary sources such as Magnus Felix Ennodius's \"Vita beatissimi viri Epiphani episcopi Ticinensis ecclesiae\", Cassiodorus's \"Variae\" and \"Laudes\" or the \"Pars Posterior\" of the Anonymus Valesianus, arguing therefrom that Rome in the West did not fall in 476, but merely awaited a \"proper Roman emperor to rule it\". According to Arnold, these two sources ultimately reveal that Theodoric was actually viewed both by the Italian nobility and the Eastern court in Constantinople as a legitimate Western Roman emperor.\nArnold built his case on the fact that Theodoric widely used the title of \"princeps\" for himself, and employed the term \"Res Publica\" to describe the domain he ruled. These titles, although archaic, were customarily reserved for the emperor and his empire. Thereto Arnold explains that the restraint shown by Theodoric in refraining to use titles such as \"Imperator\", \"Imperium\" or \"Augustus\" was aimed at sparing the pride of the Eastern monarchy and ensuring Byzantium of its seniority, but that this did not diminish Theodoric's claim to the purple in the West.\nThis view is however rejected by other scholars, such as Theodoric's most recent biographer, Hans-Ulrich Wiemer. He claims that Jonathan J. Arnold takes at face value, comments of a few interested parties among the Italian nobility. Wiemer contends that these few sources, close to Theodoric and of a doubtful impartiality, should not be used to infer the general opinion toward Theodoric from all classes of the Italian population or among the residents of Constantinople. He further states that this vision of Theodoric's position fails to address the duality of his rule; namely, having to retain the loyalty of both Romans and Goths alike. Wiemer posits that, \"The \u201cRoman\u201d interpretation of Theodoric has recently been taken to extremes in the theory that Theodoric was virtually a Western Roman emperor in Italy. According to this view, Theodoric restored the Roman Empire in the West, which he ruled as \"princeps Romanus\". \u00bb Demonstrating his doubts on this, Wiemer points out how during Theodoric's rule, he kept the two ethnic groups\u2014Italo-Romans and Goths\u2014clearly separated. For instance, only Goths could carry certain military equipment (swords, lances, shields, and helmets) or assume key positions in the military hierarchy, and the hairstyles between Goths and Romans remained distinctive, let alone their language. Wiemer also avows that the Eastern court never formally acknowledged Theodoric as a Western Emperor, a necessary condition to become one, the last of which ever recognized by Constantinople being Julius Nepos, who died in 480. Additionally, Wiemer highlights the fact that for political reasons, the Frankish and Burgundian kings never recognized Theodoric as an emperor\u2014each established as rulers in their own right\u2014and as the Ostrogothic king's Germanic kinsman, they were tied to one another via diplomatic marriages.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

These include ethanol, scopolamine, 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate, midazolam, flunitrazepam, sodium thiopental, and amobarbital, among others.\nAlthough a variety of such substances have been tested, serious issues have been raised about their use scientifically, ethically, and legally. There is currently no drug proven to cause consistent or predictable enhancement of truth-telling. Subjects questioned under the influence of such substances have been found to be suggestible and their memories subject to reconstruction and fabrication. While such drugs have been used in the course of investigating civil and criminal cases, they have not been accepted by Western legal systems and legal experts as genuine investigative tools. In the United States, it has been suggested that their use is a potential violation of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution (the right to remain silent). Concerns have also been raised through the European Court of Human Rights, arguing that use of a truth serum could be considered a violation of a human right to be free from degrading treatment, or could be considered a form of torture, and has been noted as a violation of the Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture.\n\"Truth serum\" was previously used in the management of psychotic patients in the practice of psychiatry. In a therapeutic context, the controlled administration of intravenous hypnotic medications is called \"narcosynthesis\" or \"narcoanalysis\". Such application was first documented by Dr. William Bleckwenn. Reliability and suggestibility of patients are concerns, and the practice of chemically inducing an involuntary mental state is now widely considered to be a form of torture.\nActive chemical substances.\nSedatives or hypnotics that alter higher cognitive function include ethanol, scopolamine, 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate, potent short or intermediate acting hypnotic benzodiazepines such as midazolam, flunitrazepam, and various short and ultra-short acting barbiturates, including sodium thiopental (commonly known by the brand name Pentothal) and amobarbital (formerly known as sodium amytal).\nReliability.\nWhile there have been many clinical studies of the efficacy of narcoanalysis in interrogation or lie detection, there is dispute whether any of them qualify as a randomized, controlled study, that would meet scientific standards for determining effectiveness.\nUse by country.\nIndia.\nIndia's Central Bureau of Investigation has used intravenous barbiturates for interrogation, often in high-profile cases. One such case was the interrogation of Ajmal Kasab, the only terrorist captured alive by police in the 2008 attacks in Mumbai, India. Kasab was a Pakistani militant and a member of the Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist group. On May 3, 2010, Kasab was found guilty of 80 offenses, including murder, waging war against India, possessing explosives, and other charges. On May 6, 2010, the same trial court sentenced him to death on four counts and to a life sentence on five counts.\nThe Central Bureau of Investigation also conducted this test on Krishna, a key witness and suspect in the high-profile 2008 Aarushi-Hemraj Murder Case to seek more information from Krishna and also determine his credibility as a witness with key information, yet not known to the investigating authorities. Per unverified various media sources, Krishna had purported to have deemed Hemraj (the prime suspect) as not guilty of Aarushi's murder, claiming he [Hemraj] \"treated Aarushi like his own daughter\".\nOn May 5, 2010 the Supreme Court Judge Balasubramaniam in the case \"Smt. Selvi vs. State of Karnataka\" held that narcoanalysis, polygraph, and brain-mapping tests were to be allowed with the consent of the accused. The judge stated: \"We are of the considered opinion that no individual can be forced and subjected to such techniques involuntarily, and by doing so it amounts to unwarranted intrusion of personal liberty.\"\nIn Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh High Court permitted narcoanalysis in the investigation of a killing of a tiger that occurred in May 2010. The Jhurjhura Tigress at Bandhavgarh National Park, a mother of three cubs, was found dead as a result of being hit by a vehicle. A Special Task Force requested the narcoanalysis testing of four persons, one of whom refused to consent on grounds of potential post-test complications.\nUSSR.\nIn 2004, \"Novaya Gazeta\", with reference to KGB General Oleg Kalugin, published an article that said that since the end of the 1980s the First and Second Directorates of the KGB had used, in exceptional cases and mostly on foreign citizens, a soluble odorless, colorless, and tasteless substance code-named SP-117, an improved successor to similar drugs used by the KGB prior, that was effective in making a subject lose control of oneself 15 minutes after intake. Most importantly, a person who would be given, consecutively, two parts of the drug, i.e. both the \"dote\" and \"antidote\", would have no recollection of what had occurred in between and feel afterward as though he had suddenly fallen asleep, the preferable way to administer the \"dote\" being in an alcoholic drink, as that would serve as a plausible explanation of the sudden onset of drowsiness.\nOther reports state that SP-117 was just a form of concentrated alcohol meant to be added to alcoholic drinks such as champagne.\nRussian Federation.\nAccording to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) officer, Alexander Kouzminov, who quit the service in the early 1990s, the officers of SVR\u2032s Directorate S, which runs SVR's \"illegals\", primarily used the drug to verify fidelity and trustworthiness of their agents who operated overseas, such as Vitaly Yurchenko. According to Alexander Litvinenko, Russian presidential candidate Ivan Rybkin was drugged with the same substance by FSB agents during his kidnapping in 2004.\nUnited States.\nScopolamine was promoted by obstetrician Robert Ernest House as an advance that would prevent false convictions, beginning in 1922. He had noted that women in childbirth who were given scopolamine could answer questions accurately even while in a state of twilight sleep, and were oftentimes \"exceedingly candid\" in their remarks. House proposed that scopolamine could be used when interrogating suspected criminals. He even arranged to administer scopolamine to prisoners in the Dallas County jail. Both men were believed to be guilty, both denied guilt under scopolamine, and both were eventually acquitted. In 1926, the use of scopolamine was rejected in a court case, by Judge Robert Walker Franklin, who questioned both its scientific origin, and the uncertainty of its effect.\nThe United States Office of Strategic Services (OSS) experimented with the use of mescaline, scopolamine, and marijuana as possible truth drugs during World War II. They concluded that the effects were not much different from those of alcohol: subjects became more talkative but that did not mean they were more truthful. Like hypnosis, there were also issues of suggestibility and interviewer influence. Cases involving scopolamine resulted in a mixture of testimonies both for and against those suspected, at times directly contradicting each other.\nLSD was also considered as a possible truth serum, but found unreliable. During the 1950s and 1960s, the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) carried out a number of investigations including Project MKUltra and Project MKDELTA, which involved illegal use of truth-drugs including LSD. A CIA-report from 1961, released in 1993, concludes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn 1963, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, in \"Townsend v. Sain\", that confessions produced as a result of ingestion of truth serum were \"unconstitutionally coerced\" and therefore inadmissible. The viability of forensic evidence produced from truth-sera has been addressed in lower courts - judges and expert witnesses have generally agreed that they are not reliable for lie detection.\nIn 1967, during his investigation into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison arranged for his key witness, Perry Russo, to be administered sodium pentothal before being questioned about his knowledge regarding an alleged conspiracy. Russo would later describe \"his conditioning by the DA's office as a complete brainwashing job\".\nIn 1995, during the search for evidence that could acquit Andres English-Howard, his defense attorney employed methohexital.\nMore recently, a judge approved the use of narcoanalysis in the 2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting trial to evaluate whether James Eagan Holmes's state of mind was valid for an insanity plea. Judge William Sylvester ruled that prosecutors would be allowed to interrogate Holmes \"under the influence of a medical drug designed to loosen him up and get him to talk\", such as sodium amytal, if he filed an insanity plea. The hope was that a 'narcoanalytic interview' could confirm whether or not he had been legally insane on July 20, the date of the shootings. It is not known whether such an examination was carried out.\nWilliam Shepherd, chair of the criminal justice section of the American Bar Association, stated, with respect to the Holmes case, that use of a \"truth-drug\" as proposed, \"to ascertain the veracity of a defendant's plea of insanity ... would provoke intense legal argument relating to Holmes's right to remain silent under the fifth amendment of the US constitution\". Discussing possible effectiveness of such an examination, psychiatrist August Piper stated that \"amytal's inhibition-lowering effects in no way prompt the subject to offer up true statements or memories\". \"Psychology Today\"'s Scott Linfield noted, as per Piper, that \"there's good reason to believe that truth-serums merely lower the threshold for reporting virtually all information, both true and false\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is located in the northwest of Libya on the edge of the desert, on a point of rocky land projecting into the Mediterranean Sea and forming a bay. It includes the port of Tripoli and the country's largest commercial and manufacturing center. It is also the site of the University of Tripoli.\nTripoli was founded in the 7th century BC by the Phoenicians, who gave it the Libyco-Berber name (), before passing into the hands of the Greek rulers of Cyrenaica as Oea (). Due to the city's long history, there are many sites of archeological significance in Tripoli. \"Tripoli\" may also refer to the (top-level administrative division in the Libyan system), the Tripoli District.\nName.\nIn the Arab world, Tripoli is also known as \"Tripoli-of-the-West\" (), to distinguish it from Tripoli, Lebanon, known in Arabic as (), meaning 'Tripoli of the Levant'. It is affectionately called \"The Mermaid of the Mediterranean\" (), describing its turquoise waters and whitewashed buildings.\nThe name derives from Ancient Greek (), from , lit.\u2009'three cities'\u00a0\u2013 referring to Oea, Sabratha and Leptis Magna. The city of Oea was the only one of the three to survive antiquity, and became known as Tripoli, within a wider region known as Tripolitania. Neighboring Sabratha was sometimes referred to by sailors as \"Old Tripoli\".\nHistory.\nOea and Tripolitania.\nThe city was founded in the 7th century BC by the Phoenicians, who gave it the Libyco-Berber name Oyat (Punic: \ud802\udd05\ud802\udd09\u202c\u202c\ud802\udd0f\u202c\ud802\udd15\u202c, \"wy\u02bft\"), suggesting that the city may have been built upon an existing native Berber city. The Phoenicians were probably attracted to the site by its natural harbor, flanked on the western shore by the small, easily defensible peninsula, on which they established their colony. The city then passed into the hands of the Greek rulers of Cyrenaica as Oea (Greek: \u1f48\u03af\u03b1, \"O\u00eda\"). Cyrene was a colony on the North African shore, a bit east of Tambroli and halfway to Egypt. The Carthaginians later wrested it again from the Greeks.\nBy the later half of the 2nd century BC, it belonged to the Romans, who included it in their province of Africa, and gave it the name of \"Regio Syrtica\". Around the beginning of the 3rd century AD, it became known as the Regio Tripolitana, meaning \"region of the three cities\", namely Oea (\"i.e.\", modern Tripoli), Sabratha and Leptis Magna. It was probably raised to the rank of a separate province by Septimius Severus, who was a native of Leptis Magna.\nIn spite of centuries of Roman habitation, the only visible Roman remains, apart from scattered columns and capitals (usually integrated in later buildings), is the Arch of Marcus Aurelius from the 2nd century AD. The fact that Tripoli has been continuously inhabited, unlike \"e.g.\", Sabratha and Leptis Magna, has meant that the inhabitants have either quarried material from older buildings (destroying them in the process) or built on top of them, burying them beneath the streets, where they remain largely unexcavated.\nThere is evidence to suggest that the Tripolitania region was in some economic decline during the 5th and 6th centuries, in part due to the political unrest spreading across the Mediterranean world in the wake of the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, as well as pressure from the invading Vandals. It is recorded by Ibn Abd al-Hakam that during the siege of Tripoli by a general of the Rashidun Caliphate named Amr ibn al-As, seven of his soldiers from the clan of Madhlij, sub branch of Kinana, unintentionally found a section on the western side of Tripoli beach that was not walled during their hunting routine. Those seven soldiers then managed to infiltrate through this way without being detected by the city guards, then managed to incite a riot within the city while shouting Takbir, causing the confused Byzantine garrison soldiers to think the Muslim forces were already inside in the city and flee towards their ship leaving Tripoli, thus allowing Amr to subdue the city easily.\nAccording to al-Baladhuri, Tripoli was, unlike Western North Africa, taken by the Muslims very early after Alexandria, in the 22nd year of the Hijra, that is between 30 November 642 and 18 November 643 AD. Following the conquest, Tripoli was ruled by dynasties based in Cairo, Egypt (first the Fatimids, Banu Khazrun, and later the Mamluks), and Kairouan in Ifriqiya (the Arab Fihrid, Muhallabid, and Aghlabid dynasties). For some time it was a part of the Berber Almohad Caliphate, Hafsid Kingdom, and Banu Thabit dynasty.\n16th to 19th centuries.\nIn 1510, the city was conquered by Pedro Navarro, Count of Oliveto for Spain. In 1530, it was assigned together with Malta to the Knights of St. John, who had been expelled by the Ottoman Turks from their stronghold on the island of Rhodes. Finding themselves in hostile territory, the Knights reinforced the city walls and built defenses. Though built on top of older buildings (possibly including a Roman public bath), much of the earliest defensive structures of the Tripoli castle (or \"Assaraya al-Hamra\", \"i.e.\", the \"Red Castle\") are attributed to the Knights of St John.\nHaving previously combated piracy from their base on Rhodes, the Knights were given charge of the city to prevent it from being retaken by Barbary pirates. The disruption the pirates caused to the Christian shipping lanes in the Mediterranean had been one of the main incentives for the Spanish conquest of the city.\nThe knights held the city until the Siege of Tripoli in 1551 and their surrender to the Ottomans, led by the Muslim Turkish commander Turgut Reis. Turgut Reis served as pasha of Tripoli. During his rule, he adorned and built up the city, making it one of the most impressive cities along the North African Coast. Turgut was buried in Tripoli after his death in 1565. His body was taken from Malta, where he had fallen during the Ottoman siege of the island, to a tomb in the Sidi Darghut Mosque which he had established close to his palace in Tripoli. The palace has since disappeared (supposedly it was situated between the so-called \"Ottoman prison\" and the Arch of Marcus Aurelius), but the mosque, along with his tomb, still stands, close to the Bab Al-Bahr gate.\nAfter the capture by the Ottoman Turks, Tripoli once again became a base of operation for Barbary pirates. One of several Western attempts to dislodge them again was a Royal Navy attack under John Narborough in 1675, of which a vivid eye-witness account has survived. Effective Ottoman rule during this period (1551\u20131711) was often hampered by the local Janissary corps. Intended to function as enforcers of local administration, the captain of the Janissaries and his cronies were often the \"de facto\" rulers.\nIn 1711, Ahmed Karamanli, a Janissary officer of Turkish origin, killed the Ottoman governor, the \"Pasha\", and established himself as ruler of the Tripolitania region. By 1714, he had asserted a sort of semi-independence from the Ottoman Sultan, heralding in the Karamanli dynasty. The Pashas of Tripoli were expected to pay a regular tributary tax to the Sultan but were in all other aspects rulers of an independent kingdom. This order of things continued under the rule of his descendants, accompanied by the brazen piracy and blackmailing until 1835 when the Ottoman Empire took advantage of an internal struggle and re-established its authority.\nThe Ottoman province (\"vilayet\") of Tripoli (including the dependent \"sanjak\" of Cyrenaica) lay along the southern shore of the Mediterranean between Tunisia in the west and Egypt in the east. Besides the city itself, the area included Cyrenaica (the Barca plateau), the chain of oases in the Aujila depression, Fezzan and the oases of Ghadames and Ghat, separated by sandy and stony wastelands. A 16th century Chinese source mentioned Tripoli and described its agricultural and textile products.\nBarbary Wars (1801 - 1815).\nIn the early part of the 19th century, the regency at Tripoli, owing to its piratical practices, was twice involved in war with the United States. In May 1801, the pasha demanded an increase in the tribute ($83,000) which the U.S. government had been paying since 1796 for the protection of their commerce from piracy under the 1796 Treaty with Tripoli. The demand was refused by third President Thomas Jefferson, and a naval force was sent from the United States to blockade Tripoli.\nThe First Barbary War (1801\u20131805) dragged on for four years. In 1803, Tripolitan fighters captured the U.S. Navy heavy frigate \"Philadelphia\" and took its commander, Captain William Bainbridge, and the entire crew as prisoners. This was after the \"Philadelphia\" was run aground when the captain tried to navigate too close to the port of Tripoli. After several hours aground and Tripolitan gun boats firing upon the \"Philadelphia\", though none ever struck the \"Philadelphia\", Captain Bainbridge made the decision to surrender. The \"Philadelphia\" was later turned against the Americans and anchored in Tripoli Harbor as a gun battery while her officers and crew were held prisoners in Tripoli. The following year, U.S. Navy Lieutenant Stephen Decatur led a successful daring nighttime raid to retake and burn the warship rather than see it remain in enemy hands. Decatur's men set fire to the \"Philadelphia\" and escaped.\nA notable incident in the war was the expedition undertaken by diplomatic Consul William Eaton with the objective of replacing the pasha with an elder brother living in exile, who had promised to accede to all the wishes of the United States. Eaton, at the head of a mixed force of US Soldiers, Sailors, and Marines, along with Greek, Arab and Turkish mercenaries numbering approximately 500, marched across the Egyptian / Libyan desert from Alexandria, Egypt and with the aid of three American warships, succeeded in capturing Derna. Soon afterward, on 3 June 1805, peace was concluded. The pasha ended his demands and received $60,000 as ransom for the \"Philadelphia\" prisoners under the 1805 Treaty with Tripoli.\nIn 1815, in consequence of further outrages and due to the humiliation of the earlier defeat, Captains Bainbridge and Stephen Decatur, at the head of an American squadron, again visited Tripoli and forced the pasha to comply with the demands of the United States. See Second Barbary War.\nLate Ottoman era (1835\u20131912).\nIn 1835, the Ottomans took advantage of a local civil war to reassert their direct authority. After that date, Tripoli was under the direct control of the Sublime Porte. Rebellions in 1842 and 1844 were unsuccessful. After the French occupation of Tunisia (1881), the Ottomans increased their garrison in Tripoli considerably.\nItalian era (1912\u20131947).\nItaly had long claimed that Tripoli fell within its zone of influence and that Italy had the right to preserve order within the state. Under the pretext of protecting its own citizens living in Tripoli from the Ottoman government, it declared war against the Ottomans on 29 September 1911, and announced its intention of annexing Tripoli. On 1 October 1911, a naval battle was fought at Prevesa, Greece, and three Ottoman vessels were destroyed.\nBy the Treaty of Lausanne, Italian sovereignty over Tripolitania and Cyrenaica was acknowledged by the Ottomans, although the caliph was permitted to exercise religious authority. Italy officially granted autonomy after the war, but gradually occupied the region. Originally administered as part of a single colony, Tripoli and its surrounding province were a separate colony from 26 June 1927 to 3 December 1934, when all Italian possessions in North Africa were merged into one colony. By 1938, Tripoli had 108,240 inhabitants, including 39,096 Italians.\nTripoli underwent a huge architectural and urbanistic improvement under Italian rule: the first thing the Italians did was to create in the early 1920s a sewage system (that until then it lacked) and a modern hospital.\nIn the coast of the province was built in 1937\u20131938 a section of the Litoranea Balbia, a road that went from Tripoli and Tunisia's frontier to the border of Egypt. The car tag for the Italian province of Tripoli was \"TL\".\nFurthermore, in 1927, the Italians founded the Tripoli International Fair, with the goal of promoting Tripoli's economy. This is the oldest trade fair in Africa. The so-called \"Fiera internazionale di Tripoli\" was one of the main international \"Fairs\" in the colonial world in the 1930s, and was internationally promoted together with the Tripoli Grand Prix as a showcase of Italian Libya.\nThe Italians created the Tripoli Grand Prix, an international motor racing event first held in 1925 on a racing circuit outside Tripoli. The Tripoli Grand Prix took place until 1940. The first airport in Libya, the Mellaha Air Base was built by the Italian Air Force in 1923 near the Tripoli racing circuit. The airport is currently called Mitiga International Airport.\nTripoli even had a railway station with some small railway connections to nearby cities, when in August 1941 the Italians started to build a new railway (with a gauge, like the one used in Egypt and Tunisia) between Tripoli and Benghazi. But the war stopped the construction the next year.\nTripoli was controlled by Italy until 1943 when the provinces of Tripolitania and Cyrenaica were captured by Allied forces. The city fell to troops of the British Eighth Army on 23 January 1943. Tripoli was then governed by the British until independence in 1951. Under the terms of the 1947 peace treaty with the Allies, Italy relinquished all claims to Libya.\nGaddafi era (1969\u20132011).\nColonel Muammar Gaddafi became leader of Libya on 1 September 1969 after a successful coup d'\u00e9tat.\nOn 15 April 1986, U.S. President Ronald Reagan ordered major bombing raids, dubbed Operation El Dorado Canyon, against Tripoli and Benghazi, killing 45 Libyan military and government personnel as well as 15 civilians. This strike followed US interception of telex messages from Libya\u2019s East Berlin embassy suggesting the involvement of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in a bomb explosion on 5 April in West Berlin's La Belle discoth\u00e8que, a nightclub frequented by US servicemen. Among the alleged fatalities of the 15 April retaliatory attack by the United States was Gaddafi's adopted daughter, Hana Gaddafi.\nThe United Nations sanctions against Libya imposed in April 1992 under Security Council Resolution 748 were lifted in September 2003, which increased traffic through the Port of Tripoli and through airports in Libya. This lifting of the resolution had a positive impact on the city's economy allowing for more goods to enter the city.\nLibyan Civil War (2011).\nIn February and March 2011, Tripoli witnessed intense anti-government protests and violent government responses resulting in hundreds killed and wounded. The city's Green Square was the scene of some of the protests. The anti-Gaddafi protests were eventually crushed, and Tripoli was the site of pro-Gaddafi rallies.\nThe city defenses loyal to Gaddafi included the military headquarters at Bab al-Aziziyah (where Gaddafi's main residence was located) and the Mitiga International Airport. At the latter, on 13 March, Ali Atiyya, a colonel of the Libyan Air Force, defected and joined the revolution.\nIn late February, rebel forces took control of Zawiya, a city approximately to the west of Tripoli, thus increasing the threat to pro-Gaddafi forces in the capital. During the subsequent battle of Zawiya, loyalist forces besieged the city and eventually recaptured it by 10 March.\nAs the 2011 military intervention in Libya commenced on 19 March to enforce a U.N. no-fly zone over the country, the city once again came under air attack. It was the second time that Tripoli was bombed since the 1986 U.S. airstrikes, and the second time since the 1986 airstrike that bombed Bab al-Azizia, Gaddafi's heavily fortified compound.\nIn July and August, Libyan online revolutionary communities posted tweets and updates on attacks by rebel fighters on pro-government vehicles and checkpoints. In one such attack, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi and Abdullah Senussi were targets. The government, however, denied revolutionary activity inside the capital.\nSeveral months after the initial uprising, rebel forces in the Nafusa Mountains advanced towards the coast, retaking Zawiya and reaching Tripoli on 21 August. On 21 August, the symbolic Green Square, immediately renamed Martyrs' Square by the rebels, was taken under rebel control and pro-Gaddafi posters were torn down and burned.\nDuring a radio address on 1 September, Gaddafi declared that the capital of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya had been moved from Tripoli to Sirte, after rebels had taken control of Tripoli.\nIn August and September 2014, Islamist armed groups extended their control of central Tripoli. The House of Representatives parliament set up operations on a Greek car ferry in Tobruk. A rival New General National Congress parliament continued to operate in Tripoli.\nRecent developments.\nThe 2022 Tripoli clashes and 2023 Tripoli clashes continued to disrupt the city.\nThe UN-recognized Libyan government in the west of the country is expected to assert its control in May 2025 following the reported killing of powerful militia leader Abdelghani al-Kikli, also known as Gheniwa.\nLaw and government.\nTripoli and its surrounding suburbs all lie within the Tripoli sha'biyah (district). In accordance with Libya's former Jamahiriya political system, Tripoli comprises Local People's Congresses where, in theory, the city's population discuss different matters and elect their own people's committee; at present there are 29 Local People's Congresses. In reality, the former revolutionary committees severely limited the democratic process by closely supervising committee and congress elections at the branch and district levels of governments, Tripoli being no exception.\nTripoli is sometimes referred to as \"the de jure capital of Libya\" because none of the country's ministries are actually located in the capital. Even the former National General People's Congress was held annually in the city of Sirte rather than in Tripoli. As part of a radical decentralization program undertaken by Gaddafi in September 1988, all General People's Committee secretariats (ministries), except those responsible for foreign liaison (foreign policy and international relations) and information, were moved outside Tripoli. According to diplomatic sources, the former Secretariat for Economy and Trade was moved to Benghazi; the Secretariat for Health to Kufra; and the remainder, excepting one, to Sirte, Muammar Gaddafi's birthplace. In early 1993 it was announced that the Secretariat for Foreign Liaison and International Co-operation was to be moved to Ra's Lanuf. In October 2011, Libya fell to The National Transitional Council (N.T.C.), which took full control, abolishing the Gaddafi-era system of national and local government.\nGeography.\nTripoli lies at the western extremity of Libya close to the Tunisian border, on the continent of Africa. Over a thousand kilometers (621 miles) separates Tripoli from Libya's second largest city, Benghazi. Coastal oases alternate with sandy areas and lagoons along the shores of Tripolitania for more than . The city lies about 70 kilometers north from the Nafusa Mountains, the source of seasonal rivers like Wadi Mejenin, which has a dam to collect seasonal water flows.\nAdministrative division.\nUntil 2007, the \"Sha'biyah\" included the city, its suburbs and their immediate surroundings. In older administrative systems and throughout history, there existed a province (\"muhafazah\"), state (\"wilayah\") or city-state with a much larger area (though not constant boundaries), which is sometimes mistakenly referred to as Tripoli but more appropriately should be called Tripolitania.\nAs a District, Tripoli borders the following districts:\nClimate.\nTripoli has a hot semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"BSh\") with hot and dry, prolonged summers and relatively wet mild winters. Although virtually rainless, summers are hot and muggy with temperatures that often exceed ; average July temperatures are between . In December, temperatures have reached as low as , but the average remains at between . The average annual rainfall is less than . Snowfall has occurred in past years.\nThe rainfall can be very erratic. Epic floods in 1945 left Tripoli underwater for several days, but two years later an unprecedented drought caused the loss of thousands of head of cattle. Deficiency in rainfall is no doubt reflected in an absence of permanent rivers or streams in the city as is indeed true throughout the entire country. The allocation of limited water is considered of sufficient importance to warrant the existence of the Secretariat of Dams and Water Resources, and damaging a source of water can be penalized by a heavy fine or imprisonment.\nThe Great Manmade River, a network of pipelines that transport water from the desert to the coastal cities, supplies Tripoli with its water. The grand scheme was initiated by Gaddafi in 1982.\nClimate change.\nA 2019 paper published in PLOS One estimated that under Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5, a \"moderate\" scenario of climate change where global warming reaches ~ by 2100, the climate of Tripoli in the year 2050 would most closely resemble the current climate of Taiz. The annual temperature would increase by , and the temperature of the warmest month by , while the temperature of the coldest month would increase by . According to Climate Action Tracker, the current warming trajectory appears consistent with , which closely matches RCP 4.5.\nEconomy.\nTripoli is one of the main hubs of Libya's economy along with Misrata. It is the leading center of banking, finance and communication in the country and is one of the leading commercial and manufacturing cities in Libya. Many of the country's largest corporations locate their headquarters and home offices in Tripoli as well as the majority of international companies.\nMajor manufactured goods include processed food, textiles, construction materials, clothing and tobacco products. Since the lifting of sanctions against Libya in 1999 and again in 2003, Tripoli has seen a rise in foreign investment as well as an increase in tourism. Increased traffic has also been recorded in the city's port as well as Libya's main international airport, Tripoli International Airport.\nThe city is home to the Tripoli International Fair, an international industrial, agricultural and commercial event located on Omar Muktar Avenue. One of the active members of the Global Association of the Exhibition Industry (UFI), located in the French capital Paris, the international fair is organized annually and takes place from 2\u201312 April. Participation averages around 30 countries as well as more than 2000 companies and organizations.\nSince the rise in tourism and influx of foreign visitors, there has been an increased demand for hotels in the city. To cater for these increased demands, the Corinthia Bab Africa Hotel located in the central business district was constructed in 2003 and is the largest hotel in Libya. Other high end hotels in Tripoli include the Al Waddan Intercontinental and the Tripoli Radisson Blu Hotel as well as others.\nNokia Solutions and Networks, a subsidiary of Finnish giant Nokia operates a technical facility in Tripoli.\nThe news website Ean Libya is based in Tripoli.\nCompanies with head offices in Tripoli include Afriqiyah Airways and Libyan Airlines. Buraq Air has its head office on the grounds of Mitiga International Airport.\nArchitecture.\nThe city's old town, the Medina, mostly took on its current form and appearance during the Ottoman period (16th century and after) and in particular during the period of Karamanli rule.383 Many ancient Roman columns can be found re-used in various historical buildings in the city.\nThe city walls were rebuilt and modified many times from the Roman period up to the Ottoman period. Their final form, which determined the overall pentagonal layout of the Medina today, dates from 16th century, when the Ottomans refortified the town.389 The city historically had at least three gates: Bab Hawwara to the southeast (probably Bab al-Mensha today), Bab Zenata (originally Bab al-Ashdar) to the west, and Bab al-Bahr to the north (close to the sea). Following later demolitions, what remains of the walls today are a section along the southwest flank of the Medina and another section to the southeast.\nThe oldest Islamic monument in Tripoli is the al-Naqah Mosque, probably first built by the Fatimid caliph al-Mu'izz in 973 but possibly even older. It was renovated or rebuilt in the early 17th century. Most other mosques in the city date in their current form to the Ottoman era. They generally have a hypostyle form with columns supporting multiple domes. The largest ones include the Mosque of Darghut Pasha (completed in 1556) and the Mosque of Ahmad Pasha al-Karamanli (completed c.\u20091738). In addition to the main prayer space, both of these mosques are accompanied by a complex of other buildings such as madrasas, bathhouses, markets (\"suq\"s), and the mausoleums of their eponymous founders. Other notable mosques in the city include the Mosque of Sidi Salem (built in the late 15th century and restored in 1670), the Mosque of Mahmud Khaznadar (1680), the Mosque of Shai'b al-Ain (1699), and the Gurgi Mosque (1834).\nThe earliest recorded madrasa in the city was the al-Mustansiriyya Madrasa built between 1257 and 1260, but it has not survived. Today, the Madrasa of Uthman Pasha (1654) is one of the most notable preserved examples of this type of building. Its main component is a square courtyard surrounded by vaulted galleries and small rooms where students lived. Attached to the northeast corner of the building are two square domed chambers, with the smaller one serving as a mosque and the larger one housing the tombs of Uthman Pasha and others.\nOf the many hammams (bathhouses) that once existed in the city, only three notable examples remain today: the Hammam al-Kabir (\"Great Bath\"), of which only a large domed chamber survives, the Hammam al-Hilqa, which was still in use in the late 20th century, and the Hammam of Darghut Pasha, built in the 17th century next to the mosque of the same name.The Medina also preserves urban caravanserais ( in Arabic, plural: ) from the Ottoman period. These generally consist of a two-storey building centered around a courtyard. The first floor was usually used for storage while the second floor was for shops. The historic houses in the city also have a similar form, with multiple stories and an internal courtyard. They are roofed with vaults or flat wooden roofs. Their decoration can consist of carved stucco and tilework.\nA clock tower, 18 meters tall, was built in 1866\u201370 by the Ottoman governor and is still one of the city's landmarks.\nUnder Italian colonial rule, various buildings were constructed in an Italianate style. These include, among others, the Galleria De Bono. The Tripoli Cathedral (now a mosque) was also built in this period. There are a number of buildings that were constructed by the Italian colonial rulers and later demolished under Gaddafi. They included the Royal Miramare Theatre, next to the Red Castle, and Tripoli Railway Central Station.\nMartyrs' Square, located near the waterfront is scattered with palm trees, the most abundant plant used for landscaping in the city. The Tripoli Zoo, located south of the city center, is a large reserve of plants, trees and open green spaces and was the country's biggest zoo. The zoo was forced to shut for safety reasons due to the Libyan Civil War, with many animals becoming more and more traumatised and distressed. After the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi, the BBC published a short news film detailing the problems the zoo now faced, from a lack of money to feed the animals, to a fragile security system. The animals, the BBC said, were recovering slowly and returning to normal. In 2013, parts of the zoo were transformed into a detention center for immigrants, who were reported in several cases to be arbitrarily arrested and tortured in the zoo.\nCulture.\nThe Red Castle of Tripoli (\"Assaraya al-Hamra\"), a vast palace complex with numerous courtyards, dominates the city skyline and is located on the outskirts of the Medina. There are some classical statues and fountains from the Ottoman period scattered around the castle. It houses the Red Castle Museum.\nPlaces of worship.\nAmong the places of worship, there are predominantly Muslim mosques. There are also Christian churches and temples: Apostolic Vicariate of Tripoli (Catholic Church), Coptic Orthodox Church, Protestant churches, Evangelical Churches.\nEducation.\nThe largest university in Tripoli, the University of Tripoli, is a public university providing free education to the city's inhabitants. Private universities and colleges have also begun to crop up in the last few years.\nInternational schools:\nSports.\nFootball is the most popular sport in the Libyan capital. Tripoli is home of the most prominent football clubs in Libya including Al Madina, Al Ahly Tripoli and Al-Ittihad Tripoli. Other sports clubs based in Tripoli include Al Wahda Tripoli and Addahra.\nThe city also played host to the Italian Super Cup in 2002. The 2017 Africa Cup of Nations were to be played in Libya, three of the venues were supposed to be in Tripoli, but it was cancelled due to the ongoing conflict of the Second Libyan Civil War.\nTripoli hosted the final games of the official 2009 African Basketball Championship.\nTransport.\nTwo trans-African automobile routes pass through Tripoli:\nTripoli International Airport was the largest airport in Tripoli and Libya before being destroyed during the second Libyan civil war in 2014. Tripoli has since been served by a smaller local airport Mitiga International Airport, which is currently the largest airport in Libya.\nIn July 2014, the Tripoli international Airport was destroyed, following the Battle of Tripoli Airport, when Zintani militias in charge of security were attacked by Islamist militias of the GNC, code naming the operation 'Libya Dawn' also known as \"Libya Dawn Militias\", led by Misurati militia general Salah Badi. The event happened after secular Zintani militias were accused with claims of smuggling drugs, alcohol and illegal items, known to have past ties with the Gaddafi Regime. Libya's Mufti Sadiq al Ghariani has praised the Libya Dawn Operation.\nThe result of the battle for Tripoli's central airport was its complete destruction with 90% of the facilities incapacitated, or burned down with an unknown estimate Billions of dollars in Damage, with another 10 or so planes destroyed. The airport was shelled with Grad rockets with reports of the Air Traffic Control tower completely destroyed, including the main reception building completely wrecked. Surrounding civilian residential areas and infrastructure, of which include Bridges, Electricity equipment, water equipment, and roads were also damaged in the fighting. Oil storage tankers containing large reserves of Kerosene fuels, gases and related chemicals were burnt and large plumes of smoke rose into the air.\nReconstruction efforts are underway with the GNA giving a contract amounting to $78 million to an Italian firm 'Emaco Group' or \"Aeneas Consorzio\", to rebuild the destroyed facilities. All flights have been diverted to ex-military base known as Mitiga International Airport as of 2017.\nTripoli is the interim destination of a railway from Sirte under construction in 2007.\nInternational relations.\nSister cities:&lt;br&gt;\n Belgrade, Serbia&lt;br&gt;\n Belo Horizonte, Brazil (2003)&lt;br&gt;\n Madrid, Spain&lt;br&gt;\n Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina (1976)\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "31235", "revid": "43775236", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31235", "title": "Tower of Babel", "text": "Mythical structure in the Hebrew Bible\nThe Tower of Babel is an origin myth and parable in the Book of Genesis (chapter 11) meant to explain the existence of different languages and cultures.\nAccording to the story, a united human race speaking a single language migrates to Shinar (Lower Mesopotamia), where they agree to build a great city with a tower that would reach the sky. Yahweh, observing these efforts and remarking on humanity's power in unity, confounds their speech so that they can no longer understand each other and scatters them around the world, leaving the city unfinished.\nSome modern scholars have associated the Tower of Babel with known historical structures and accounts, particularly from ancient Mesopotamia. The most widely attributed inspiration is Etemenanki, a ziggurat dedicated to the god Marduk in Babylon, which in Hebrew was called \"Babel\". A similar story is also found in the ancient Sumerian legend, \"Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta\", which describes events and locations in southern Mesopotamia.\nEtymology.\nThe phrase \"Tower of Babel\" does not appear in Genesis nor elsewhere in the Bible; it is always \"the city and the tower\" or just \"the city\". The original derivation of the name Babel, which is the Hebrew name for Babylon, is uncertain. The native Akkadian name of the city was , meaning 'gate of God'. However, that form and interpretation itself are now usually thought to derive from Akkadian folk etymology applied to an earlier form of the name, , of unknown meaning and probably non-Semitic origin.\nPer the story in Genesis, the city received the name \"Babel\" from the Hebrew verb , meaning to jumble or to confuse, after Yahweh distorted the common language of humankind. According to \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\", this reflects word play due to the Hebrew terms for Babylon and \"to confuse\" having similar pronunciation.\nAnalysis.\nGenre.\nThe Tower of Babel is a type of myth known as an etiology, which is intended to explain the origin of a custom, ritual, geographical feature, name, or other phenomenon\u2014namely the origins of the multiplicity of languages. The confusion of tongues () resulting from the construction of the Tower of Babel accounts for the fragmentation of human languages: God was concerned that humans had blasphemed by building the tower to avoid a second flood and so God brought into existence multiple languages, rendering humanity unable to understand each other.51\nPrior to this event, humanity was stated to speak a single language, although the preceding Genesis 10:5 states that the descendants of Japheth, Gomer, and Javan dispersed \"with their own tongues\". Augustine of Hippo explained this apparent contradiction by arguing that the story \"without mentioning it, goes back to tell how it came about that the one language common to all men was broken up into many tongues\". Modern scholarship has traditionally held that the two chapters were written by different sources, the former by the Priestly source and the latter by the Jahwist. However, that theory has been debated among scholars in recent years.\nThemes.\nThe story's theme of competition between God and humans appears elsewhere in Genesis, in the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. The first century Jewish interpretation found in Flavius Josephus explains the construction of the tower as a hubristic act of defiance against God ordered by the arrogant tyrant Nimrod.\nThere have been some contemporary challenges to this classical interpretation, with emphasis placed on the explicit motive of cultural and linguistic homogeneity mentioned in the narrative (11:1, 4, 6); this reading of the text sees God's actions not as a punishment for pride, but as an etiology of cultural differences, presenting Babel as the cradle of civilization.\nHeight.\nThe Book of Genesis does not specify the tower's height; the phrase \"its top in the sky\" (11:4) was an idiom for impressive height, rather than implying arrogance.37 The Book of Jubilees 10:21 mentions the tower's height as being 5,433 cubits and 2 palms (), about three times the height of Burj Khalifa.\nThe apocryphal Third Apocalypse of Baruch mentions that the \"tower of strife\" reached a height of 463 cubits (), taller than any structure built in human history until the construction of the Eiffel Tower in 1889, which is in height.\nGregory of Tours writing c.\u2009594, quotes the earlier historian Orosius (c.\u2009417) as saying the tower was \"laid out foursquare on a very level plain. Its wall, made of baked brick cemented with pitch\" is 50 cubits in width by 200 cubits in length (), and 470 stades () in circumference. A \"stade\" was an ancient Greek unit of length, based on the circumference of a typical sports stadium of the time which was about . The description continues, \"Twenty-five gates are situated on each side, which make in all one hundred. The doors of these gates, which are of wonderful size, are cast in bronze. The same historian tells many other tales of this city, and says: 'Although such was the glory of its building still it was conquered and destroyed.'\"\nA typical medieval account is given by Giovanni Villani (1300): He relates that \"it measured eighty miles [130\u00a0km] round, and it was already 4,000 paces high [] and 1,000 paces thick, and each pace is three of our feet.\" The 14th-century traveler John Mandeville also included an account of the tower and reported that its height had been 64 furlongs (, according to the local inhabitants.\nThe 17th-century historian Verstegan provides yet another figure\u00a0\u2013 quoting Isidore, he says that the tower was 5,164 paces high (), and quoting Josephus that the tower was wider than it was high, more like a mountain than a tower. He also quotes unnamed authors who say that the spiral path was so wide that it contained lodgings for workers and animals, and other authors who claim that the path was wide enough to have fields for growing grain for the animals used in the construction.\nIn his book, \"Structures: Or Why Things Don't Fall Down\", J. E. Gordon considers the height of the Tower of Babel. He wrote, \"brick and stone weigh about 120\u00a0lb per cubic foot (2,000\u00a0kg per cubic metre) and the crushing strength of these materials is generally rather better than 6,000\u00a0lbs per square inch or 40 mega-pascals. Elementary arithmetic shows that a tower with parallel walls could have been built to a height of before the bricks at the bottom were crushed. However, by making the walls taper towards the top they ... could well have been built to a height where the men of Shinnar would run short of oxygen and had difficulty in breathing before the brick walls crushed beneath their own dead weight.\"\nComposition.\nAuthorship.\nJewish and Christian tradition attributes the composition of the whole Pentateuch, which includes the story of the Tower of Babel, to Moses. Modern biblical scholarship rejects Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch but is divided on the question of its authorship. Many scholars subscribe to some form of the documentary hypothesis, which argues that the Pentateuch is composed of multiple \"sources\" that were later merged. Scholars who favor this hypothesis, such as Richard Elliot Friedman, tend to see Genesis 11:1\u20139 as being composed by the J or Jahwist/Yahwist source.\nMichael Coogan suggests that the intentional word play regarding the city of Babel, and the noise of the people's \"babbling\" is found in the Hebrew words as easily as in English, is considered typical of the Yahwist source.51 John Van Seters, who has put forth substantial modifications to the hypothesis, suggests that these verses are part of what he calls a \"Pre-Yahwistic stage\". Other scholars reject the documentary hypothesis altogether. The \"minimalist\" scholars tend to see the books of Genesis through 2 Kings as written by a single, anonymous author during the Hellenistic period.\nHistoricity.\nBiblical scholars see the Book of Genesis as mythological and not as an historical account of events. Genesis is described as beginning with historicized myth and ending with mythicized history. Nevertheless, the story of Babel can be interpreted in terms of its context: Elsewhere in Genesis, it is stated that Babel (LXX: \u0392\u03b1\u03b2\u03c5\u03bb\u03ce\u03bd) formed part of Nimrod's kingdom, which is located in Lower Mesopotamia. The Bible does not specifically mention that Nimrod ordered the building of the tower, but many other sources have associated its construction with him. Genesis 11:9 attributes the Hebrew version of the name, \"Babel\", to the verb \"balal\", which means \"to confuse or confound\" in Hebrew. The first century Roman-Jewish author Flavius Josephus similarly explained that the name was derived from the Hebrew word \"Babel (\u05d1\u05d1\u05dc)\", meaning \"confusion\".\nPossible origins.\nEtemenanki.\nEtemenanki (Sumerian: \"temple of the foundation of heaven and earth\") was the name of a ziggurat dedicated to Marduk in the city of Babylon. It was famously rebuilt by the 6th-century BCE Neo-Babylonian rulers Nabopolassar and Nebuchadnezzar II, but had fallen into disrepair by the time of Alexander the Great's conquests. He managed to move the tiles of the tower to another location, but his death stopped the reconstruction, and it was demolished during the reign of his successor Antiochus Soter. Greek historian Herodotus (c.\u2009484\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009425\u00a0BC) wrote an account of the ziggurat in his \"Histories\", which he called the \"Temple of Zeus Belus\".\nAccording to modern scholars, the biblical story of the Tower of Babel was likely influenced by Etemenanki. Stephen L. Harris proposed this occurred during the Babylonian captivity. Isaac Asimov speculated that the authors of Genesis 11:1\u20139 were inspired by the existence of an apparently incomplete ziggurat at Babylon, and by the phonological similarity between Babylonian \"Bab-ilu\", meaning \"gate of God\", and the Hebrew word , meaning \"mixed\", \"confused\", or \"confounded\".\nMesopotamian analogues.\nThere are similar stories to the Tower of Babel. In the Sumerian myth \"Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta\", Enmerkar of Uruk is building a massive ziggurat in Eridu and demands a tribute of precious materials from Aratta for its construction, at one point reciting an incantation imploring the god Enki to restore (or in Kramer's translation, to disrupt) the linguistic unity of the inhabited regions\u2014named as Shubur, Hamazi, Sumer, Uri-ki (Akkad), and the Martu land, \"the whole universe, the well-guarded people\u2014may they all address Enlil together in a single language.\"\nThe Eridu Genesis, an ancient Sumerian flood myth, includes a passage about the unity of human speech before the gods intervened. During the Neo-Assyrian period, a fragmentary text found in Nineveh, from the library of Ashurbanipal (r. 668\u2013627 BCE), which contains parts of the Eridu Genesis, along with the general interest Ashurbanipal's library had in preserving older traditions, suggest that these stories of language confusion and divine intervention were still relevant during this period.\nThis is further evidenced by the Neo-Assyrian divine punishment motif often found in royal inscriptions, which describe the gods punishing nations for their arrogance, particularly through destruction, scattering, or confusion\u2014a theme seen in the Tower of Babel story.\nIn the annals of the Neo-Assyrian king Sennacherib (r. 705\u2013681 BCE), he describes how the gods \"confused the plans\" of his enemies and scattered their forces, resulting in his victory and the destruction of Babylon in 689 BCE. These events may have influenced later biblical writers during the period of Babylonian captivity, who viewed the city\u2019s fall as a divine act, reinforcing the idea that Babylon\u2019s pride led to its downfall.\nLater literature.\nBook of Jubilees.\nThe Book of Jubilees contains one of the most detailed accounts found anywhere of the Tower.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And they began to build, and in the fourth week they made brick with fire, and the bricks served them for stone, and the clay with which they cemented them together was asphalt which comes out of the sea, and out of the fountains of water in the land of Shinar. And they built it: forty and three years were they building it; its breadth was 203 bricks, and the height [of a brick] was the third of one; its height amounted to 5433 cubits and 2 palms, and [the extent of one wall was] thirteen stades [and of the other thirty stades].\u2014\u200a\nPseudo-Philo.\nIn Pseudo-Philo, the direction for the building is ascribed not only to Nimrod, who is made prince of the Hamites, but also to Joktan, as prince of the Semites, and to Phenech son of Dodanim, as prince of the Japhetites. Twelve men are arrested for refusing to bring bricks, including Abraham, Lot, Nahor, and several sons of Joktan. However, Joktan finally saves the twelve from the wrath of the other two princes.\nJosephus' \"Antiquities of the Jews\".\nThe Jewish-Roman historian Flavius Josephus, in his \"Antiquities of the Jews\" (c.\u200994\u00a0CE), recounted history as found in the Hebrew Bible and mentioned the Tower of Babel. He wrote that it was Nimrod who had the tower built and that Nimrod was a tyrant who tried to turn the people away from God. In this account, God confused the people rather than destroying them because annihilation with a Flood had not taught them to be godly.\nNow it was Nimrod who excited them to such an affront and contempt of God. He was the grandson of Ham, the son of Noah, a bold man, and of great strength of hand. He persuaded them not to ascribe it to God as if it were through his means they were happy, but to believe that it was their own courage which procured that happiness. He also gradually changed the government into tyranny, seeing no other way of turning men from the fear of God, but to bring them into a constant dependence on his power... Now the multitude were very ready to follow the determination of Nimrod and to esteem it a piece of cowardice to submit to God; and they built a tower, neither sparing any pains, nor being in any degree negligent about the work: and, by reason of the multitude of hands employed in it, it grew very high, sooner than any one could expect; but the thickness of it was so great, and it was so strongly built, that thereby its great height seemed, upon the view, to be less than it really was. It was built of burnt brick, cemented together with mortar, made of bitumen, that it might not be liable to admit water. When God saw that they acted so madly, he did not resolve to destroy them utterly, since they were not grown wiser by the destruction of the former sinners [in the Flood]; but he caused a tumult among them, by producing in them diverse languages, and causing that, through the multitude of those languages, they should not be able to understand one another. The place wherein they built the tower is now called Babylon, because of the confusion of that language which they readily understood before; for the Hebrews mean by the word Babel, confusion. The Sibyl also makes mention of this tower, and of the confusion of the language, when she says thus:\u2014\"When all men were of one language, some of them built a high tower, as if they would thereby ascend up to heaven; but the gods sent storms of wind and overthrew the tower, and gave everyone a peculiar language; and for this reason it was that the city was called Babylon.\"\nGreek Apocalypse of Baruch.\nThird Apocalypse of Baruch (or 3 Baruch, c. 2nd century), one of the pseudepigrapha, describes the just rewards of sinners and the righteous in the afterlife. Among the sinners are those who instigated the Tower of Babel. In the account, Baruch is first taken (in a vision) to see the resting place of the souls of \"those who built the tower of strife against God, and the Lord banished them.\" Next he is shown another place, and there, occupying the form of dogs,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Those who gave counsel to build the tower, for they whom thou seest drove forth multitudes of both men and women, to make bricks; among whom, a woman making bricks was not allowed to be released in the hour of child-birth, but brought forth while she was making bricks, and carried her child in her apron, and continued to make bricks. And the Lord appeared to them and confused their speech, when they had built the tower to the height of four hundred and sixty-three cubits. And they took a gimlet, and sought to pierce the heavens, saying, \"Let us see (whether) the heaven is made of clay, or of brass, or of iron.\" When God saw this He did not permit them, but smote them with blindness and confusion of speech, and rendered them as thou seest.\u2014\u200a\nMidrash.\nRabbinic literature offers many different accounts of other causes for building the Tower of Babel, and of the intentions of its builders. According to one midrash the builders of the Tower, called \"the generation of secession\" in the Jewish sources, said: \"God has no right to choose the upper world for Himself, and to leave the lower world to us; therefore we will build us a tower, with an idol on the top holding a sword, so that it may appear as if it intended to war with God\" (Gen. R. https://; Tan., ed. Buber, Noah, xxvii. et seq.).\nThe building of the Tower was meant to bid defiance not only to God, but also to Abraham, who exhorted the builders to reverence. The passage mentions that the builders spoke sharp words against God, saying that once every 1,656 years, heaven tottered so that the water poured down upon the earth, therefore they would support it by columns that there might not be another deluge (Gen. R. l.c.; Tan. l.c.; similarly Josephus, \"Ant.\" i. 4, \u00a7 2).\nSome among that generation even wanted to war against God in heaven (Talmud Sanhedrin 109a). They were encouraged in this undertaking by the notion that arrows that they shot into the sky fell back dripping with blood, so that the people really believed that they could wage war against the inhabitants of the heavens (Sefer ha-Yashar, Chapter 9:12\u201336). According to Josephus and Midrash Pirke R. El. xxiv., it was mainly Nimrod who persuaded his contemporaries to build the Tower, while other rabbinical sources assert, on the contrary, that Nimrod separated from the builders.\nAccording to another midrashic account, one third of the Tower builders were punished by being transformed into semi-demonic creatures and banished into three parallel dimensions, inhabited now by their descendants.\nIslamic tradition.\nThe Quran has no story about the Tower of Babel. However, similar stories appear in the Qisas al-Anbiya. Although variations similar to the biblical narrative of the Tower of Babel exist within Islamic tradition, the central theme of God separating humankind on the basis of language is alien to Islam according to the author Yahiya Emerick. In Islamic belief, he argues, God created nations to know each other and not to be separated.\nIn the \"History of the Prophets and Kings\" by the 9th-century Muslim theologian al-Tabari, a fuller version is given: Nimrod has the tower built in Babil, God destroys it, and the language of mankind, formerly Syriac, is then confused into 72 languages. A tale about Babel appears more fully in the writings of Yaqut (i, 448 f.) and the \"Lis\u0101n al-\u02bfArab\" (xiii. 72), but without the tower: mankind were swept together by winds into the plain that was afterward called \"Babil\", where they were assigned their separate languages by God, and were then scattered again in the same way. Another Muslim historian of the 13th century, Abu al-Fida relates the same story, adding that the patriarch Eber (an ancestor of Abraham) was allowed to keep the original tongue, Hebrew in this case, because he would not partake in the building.\nBook of Mormon.\nIn the Book of Mormon, a man named Jared and his family ask God that their language not be confounded at the time of the \"great tower\". Because of their prayers, God preserves their language and leads them to the Valley of Nimrod. From there, they travel across the sea to the Americas.\nDespite no mention of the Tower of Babel in the original text of the Book of Mormon, some leaders in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) assert that the \"great tower\" was indeed the Tower of Babel \u2013 as in the 1981 introduction to the Book of Mormon \u2013 despite the chronology of the Book of Ether aligning more closely with the 21st century BC Sumerian tower temple myth of Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta to the goddess Innana. Church apologists have also supported this connection and argue the reality of the Tower of Babel: \"Although there are many in our day who consider the accounts of the Flood and tower of Babel to be fiction, Latter-day Saints affirm their reality.\" In either case, the church firmly believes in the factual nature of at least one \"great tower\" built in the region of ancient Sumer/Assyria/Babylonia.\nGnosticism.\nIn Gnostic tradition recorded in the Paraphrase of Shem, a tower, interpreted as the Tower of Babel, is brought by demons along with the great flood:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And he caused the flood, and he destroyed your (Shem's) race, to take the light and to take away from faith. But I proclaimed quickly by the mouth of the demon that a tower come up to be up to the particle of light, which was left in the demons and their race \u2013 which was water \u2013 that the demon might be protected from the turbulent chaos. And the womb planned these things according to my will, that she might pour forth completely. A tower came to be through the demons. The darkness was disturbed by his loss. He loosened the muscles of the womb. And the demon who was going to enter the tower was protected so that the races might continue to acquire coherence through him.\nLinguistics.\nFor a long time, historical linguistics wrestled with the idea of a single original language. In the Middle Ages and down to the 17th century, attempts were made to identify a living descendant of the Adamic language.\nMultiplication of languages.\nThe literal belief that the world's linguistic variety originated with the tower of Babel is pseudolinguistics and is contrary to the known facts about the origin and history of languages.\nIn the biblical introduction of the Tower of Babel account, in Genesis 11:1, it is said that everyone on Earth spoke the same language, but this is inconsistent with the biblical description of the post-Noahic world described in Genesis 10:5, where it is said that the descendants of Shem, Ham, and Japheth gave rise to different nations, each with their own language.\nThere have also been a number of traditions around the world that describe a divine confusion of the one original language into several, albeit without any tower. Aside from the Ancient Greek myth that Hermes confused the languages, causing Zeus to give his throne to Phoroneus, Frazer specifically mentions such accounts among the Wasania of Kenya, the Kacha Naga people of Assam, the inhabitants of Encounter Bay in Australia, the Maidu of California, the Tlingit of Alaska, and the K'iche' Maya of Guatemala.\nThe Estonian myth of \"the Cooking of Languages\" has also been compared.\nDuring the Middle Ages, the Hebrew language was widely considered the language used by God to address Adam in Paradise, and by Adam as lawgiver (the Adamic language) by various Jewish, Christian, and Muslim scholastics.\nDante Alighieri addresses the topic in his \"De vulgari eloquentia\" (1302\u20131305). He argues that the Adamic language is of divine origin and therefore unchangeable.\nIn his \"Divine Comedy\" (c. 1308\u20131320), however, Dante changes his view to another that treats the Adamic language as the product of Adam. This had the consequence that it could no longer be regarded as immutable, and hence Hebrew could not be regarded as identical with the language of Paradise. Dante concludes (\"Paradiso\" XXVI) that Hebrew is a derivative of the language of Adam. In particular, the chief Hebrew name for God in scholastic tradition, \"El\", must be derived of a different Adamic name for God, which Dante gives as \"I\".\nBefore the acceptance of the Indo-European language family, these languages were considered to be \"Japhetite\" by some authors (e.g., Rasmus Rask in 1815; see Indo-European studies). Beginning in Renaissance Europe, priority over Hebrew was claimed for the alleged Japhetic languages, which were supposedly never corrupted because their speakers had not participated in the construction of the Tower of Babel. Among the candidates for a living descendant of the Adamic language were: Gaelic (see \"Auraicept na n-\u00c9ces\"); Tuscan (Giovanni Battista Gelli, 1542, Pier Francesco Giambullari, 1564); Dutch (Goropius Becanus, 1569, Abraham Mylius, 1612); Swedish (Olaus Rudbeck, 1675); German (Georg Philipp Harsd\u00f6rffer, 1641, Schottel, 1641). The Swedish physician Andreas Kempe wrote a satirical tract in 1688, where he made fun of the contest between the European nationalists to claim their native tongue as the Adamic language. Caricaturing the attempts by the Swede Olaus Rudbeck to pronounce Swedish the original language of mankind, Kempe wrote a scathing parody where Adam spoke Danish, God spoke Swedish, and the serpent French.\nThe primacy of Hebrew was still defended by some authors until the emergence of modern linguistics in the second half of the 18th century, e.g. by Pierre Besnier (1648\u20131705) in \"A philosophicall essay for the reunion of the languages, or, the art of knowing all by the mastery of one\" (1675) and by Gottfried Hensel (1687\u20131767) in his \"Synopsis Universae Philologiae\" (1741).\nEnumeration of scattered languages.\nThere are several mediaeval historiographic accounts that attempt to make an enumeration of the languages scattered at the Tower of Babel. Because a count of all the descendants of Noah listed by name in chapter 10 of Genesis (LXX) provides 15 names for Japheth's descendants, 30 for Ham's, and 27 for Shem's, these figures became established as the 72 languages resulting from the confusion at Babel\u2014although the exact listing of these languages changed over time. (The LXX Bible has two additional names, Elisa and Cainan, not found in the Masoretic text of this chapter, so early rabbinic traditions, such as the \"Mishna\", speak instead of \"70 languages\".) Some of the earliest sources for 72 (sometimes 73) languages are the 2nd-century Christian writers Clement of Alexandria (\"Stromata\" I, 21) and Hippolytus of Rome (\"On the Psalms\" 9); it is repeated in the Syriac book \"Cave of Treasures\" (c.\u2009350\u00a0CE), Epiphanius of Salamis' \"Panarion\" (c.\u2009375) and St. Augustine's \"The City of God\" 16.6 (c.\u2009410). The chronicles attributed to Hippolytus (c.\u2009234) contain one of the first attempts to list each of the 72 peoples who were believed to have spoken these languages.\nIsidore of Seville in his \"Etymologiae\" (c.\u2009600) mentions the number of 72; however, his list of names from the Bible drops the sons of Joktan and substitutes the sons of Abraham and Lot, resulting in only about 56 names total; he then appends a list of some of the nations known in his own day, such as the Longobards and the Franks. This listing was to prove quite influential on later accounts that made the Lombards and Franks themselves into descendants of eponymous grandsons of Japheth, e.g. the \"Historia Brittonum\" (c.\u2009833), \"The Meadows of Gold\" by al Masudi (c.\u2009947) and \"Book of Roads and Kingdoms\" by al-Bakri (1068), the 11th-century \"Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn\", and the midrashic compilations \"Yosippon\" (c.\u2009950), \"Chronicles of Jerahmeel\", and \"Sefer haYashar\".\nOther sources that mention 72 (or 70) languages scattered from Babel are the Old Irish poem \"Cu cen mathair\" by Luccreth moccu Chiara (c.\u2009600); the Irish monastic work \"Auraicept na n-\u00c9ces\"; \"History of the Prophets and Kings\" by the Persian historian Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari (c.\u2009915); the Anglo-Saxon dialogue \"Solomon and Saturn\"; the Russian \"Primary Chronicle\" (c.\u20091113); the Jewish Kabbalistic work \"Bahir\" (1174); the \"Prose Edda\" of Snorri Sturluson (c.\u20091200); the Syriac \"Book of the Bee\" (c.\u20091221); the \"Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum\" (c.\u20091284; mentions 22 for Shem, 31 for Ham and 17 for Japheth for a total of 70); Villani's 1300 account; and the rabbinic \"Midrash ha-Gadol\" (14th century). Villani adds that it \"was begun 700 years after the Flood, and there were 2,354 years from the beginning of the world to the confusion of the Tower of Babel. And we find that they were 107 years working at it; and men lived long in those times\". According to the \"Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum\", however, the project was begun only 200 years following the Deluge.\nThe tradition of 72 languages persisted into later times. Both Jos\u00e9 de Acosta in his 1576 treatise \"De procuranda indorum salute\", and Ant\u00f3nio Vieira a century later in his \"Serm\u00e3o da Epifania\", expressed amazement at how much this 'number of tongues' could be surpassed, there being hundreds of mutually unintelligible languages indigenous only to Peru and Brazil.\nComparable myths.\nGreco-Roman parallel.\nIn Greek mythology, much of which was adopted by the Romans, there is a myth referred to as the Gigantomachy, the battle fought between the Giants and the Olympian gods for supremacy of the cosmos. In Ovid's telling of the myth, the Giants attempt to reach the gods in heaven by stacking mountains, but are repelled by Jupiter's thunderbolts. A.S. Kline translates Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\" 1.151\u2013155 as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Rendering the heights of heaven no safer than the earth, they say the giants attempted to take the Celestial kingdom, piling mountains up to the distant stars. Then the all-powerful father of the gods hurled his bolt of lightning, fractured Olympus and threw Mount Pelion down from Ossa below.\nMexico.\nVarious traditions similar to that of the tower of Babel are found in Latin America. Some writers connected the Great Pyramid of Cholula to the Tower of Babel. The Dominican friar Diego Dur\u00e1n (1537\u20131588) reported hearing an account about the pyramid from a hundred-year-old priest at Cholula, shortly after the conquest of the Aztec Empire. He wrote that he was told when the light of the Sun first appeared upon the land, giants appeared and set off in search of the Sun. Not finding it, they built a tower to reach the sky. An angered God of the Heavens called upon the inhabitants of the sky, who destroyed the tower and scattered its inhabitants. The story was not related to either a flood or the confusion of languages, although Frazer connects its construction and the scattering of the giants with the Tower of Babel.\nAnother story, attributed by the native historian Fernando de Alva Cort\u00e9s Ixtlilx\u00f3chitl (c. 1565\u20131648) to the ancient Toltecs, states that after men had multiplied following a great deluge, they erected a tall \"zacuali\" or tower, to preserve themselves in the event of a second deluge. However, their languages were confounded and they went to separate parts of the Earth.\nArizona.\nStill another story, attributed to the Tohono O'odham people, holds that Montezuma escaped a great flood, then became wicked and attempted to build a house reaching to heaven, but the Great Spirit destroyed it with thunderbolts.\nNepal.\nTraces of a somewhat similar story have also been reported among the Tharu of Nepal and northern India.\nBotswana.\nAccording to David Livingstone, the people he met living near Lake Ngami in 1849 had such a tradition, but with the builders' heads getting \"cracked by the fall of the scaffolding\".\nOther traditions.\nIn his 1918 book, \"Folklore in the Old Testament\", Scottish social anthropologist Sir James George Frazer documented similarities between Old Testament stories, such as the Flood, and indigenous legends around the world. He identified Livingston's account with a tale found in Lozi mythology, wherein the wicked men build a tower of masts to pursue the Creator-God, Nyambe, who has fled to Heaven on a spider-web, but the men perish when the masts collapse. He further relates similar tales of the Ashanti that substitute a pile of porridge pestles for the masts. Frazer moreover cites such legends found among the Kongo people, as well as in Tanzania, where the men stack poles or trees in a failed attempt to reach the Moon. He further cited the Karbi and Kuki people of Assam as having a similar story. The traditions of the Karen people of Myanmar, which Frazer considered to show clear 'Abrahamic' influence, also relate that their ancestors migrated there following the abandonment of a great pagoda in the land of the Karenni 30 generations from Adam, when the languages were confused and the Karen separated from the Karenni. He notes yet another version current in the Admiralty Islands, where mankind's languages are confused following a failed attempt to build houses reaching to heaven.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is best known for the films \"The Celebration\" (1998), \"Submarino\" (2010), \"The Hunt\" (2012), \"Far from the Madding Crowd\" (2015), and \"Another Round\" (2020). For \"Another Round\" he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director, the first Danish filmmaker nominated in the Best Director category.\nEarly life and education.\nVinterberg was born in Frederiksberg, Denmark. In 1993, he graduated from the National Film School of Denmark with \"Last Round\" (\"Sidste omgang\"), which won the jury and producers' awards at the Internationales Festival der Filmhochschulen M\u00fcnchen, and First Prize at Tel Aviv.\nCareer.\nIn 1993 Vinterberg made his first TV drama for DR TV and his short fiction film \"The Boy Who Walked Backwards\", produced by Birgitte Hald at Nimbus Film. The film won awards at the 1994 Nordisk Panorama Film Festival, the International Short Film Festival in Clermont-Ferrand, and the Toronto International Film Festival. His first feature film was \"The Biggest Heroes\" (\"De St\u00f8rste Helte\"), a road movie that received acclaim in his native Denmark. In 1995, Vinterberg formed the Dogme 95 movement with Lars von Trier, Kristian Levring, and S\u00f8ren Kragh-Jacobsen.\nFollowing that dogma in 1998, he conceived, wrote and directed (and also had a small acting role in) the first of the Dogme movies, \"The Celebration\" (\"Festen\"). As per the rules of the Dogme manifesto, he did not take a directorial credit. However, he and the film won numerous nominations and awards, including the Jury Prize at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival. At the turn of the century, Vinterberg participated in the experimental broadcast \"D-dag\", where he and three other filmmakers directed broadcasts on four different channels, with the viewer able to switch between them and create their own viewing experience. A final edit was released in 2001.\nIn 2003, he directed the apocalyptic science fiction romance-drama \"It's All About Love\", a film he wrote, directed and produced himself over a period of five years. The film was entirely in English and featured, among others, Joaquin Phoenix, Claire Danes, and Sean Penn. The movie did not do well, as critics and audiences found it idiosyncratic and somewhat incomprehensible. His next film, the English-language \"Dear Wendy\" (2005), scripted by Lars von Trier, had poor ticket sales in his native Denmark where it sold only 14,521 tickets. However he won the Silver George for Best Director at the 27th Moscow International Film Festival. Vinterberg then tried to retrace his roots with a smaller Danish-language production, \"En mand kommer hjem\" (2007), which also had poor ticket sales in his native Denmark, selling only 31,232 tickets.\nOn 1 August 2008, he directed the music video for \"The Day That Never Comes\", the first single off Metallica's album \"Death Magnetic\". His 2010 film \"Submarino\" was nominated for the Golden Bear at the 60th Berlin International Film Festival. In 2012, his film \"The Hunt\" competed for the Palme d'Or at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 86th Academy Awards.\nIn 2015, he directed \"Far from the Madding Crowd\", an adaptation of the acclaimed Thomas Hardy novel, starring Carey Mulligan, Matthias Schoenaerts, Michael Sheen and Tom Sturridge. Vinterberg reunited with Matthias Schoenaerts in \"Kursk\", a film about the Kursk submarine disaster that happened in 2000.\nIn 2019, Vinterberg lost his daughter Ida in a car accident while she was traveling home from Belgium with her mother. As such, he dedicated \"Another Round\" (\"Druk\") to her, while filming much of the film in her school with her classmates. Vinterberg was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director for the film, which also won the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language and the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film; he dedicated the latter award to Ida. \nIn 2024, Vinterberg's first foray into directing for TV was broadcast in Denmark. The seven-episode series called \"Families like Ours\" explores a near-future Denmark when the country is gradually evacuated due to rising sea levels.\nAwards and honours.\nIn April 2016, the French government appointed Vinterberg a Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. For his film \"Another Round\" he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director and won the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Walker near Laurel, Maryland, the Tomahawk emerged in the 1970s as a modular cruise missile first manufactured by General Dynamics. Early tests of the missile took place between 1983 and 1993, during which time 23 cruise missiles were tested over northern Canada under the \"Canada\u2013U.S. Test and Evaluation Program\". The goal of the program was to simulate the climate and terrain similar to that of the northern Soviet Union, and to allow the North American Aerospace Defence Command (NORAD) to develop an anti-cruise capability. The Tomahawk aimed to fulfill the need for a medium- to long-range, low-altitude missile with diverse capabilities. Its modular design allows for compatibility with a range of warheads, including high-explosive, submunitions, and bunker-busters. The Tomahawk can use a variety of guidance systems, including GPS, inertial navigation, and terrain contour matching. Over a dozen variants and upgraded versions have been developed since the original design, including air-, sub-, and ground-launched configurations with both conventional and nuclear armaments. The Tomahawk's manufacturing history has seen several transitions. General Dynamics served as the sole supplier in the 1970s. From 1992 until 1994, McDonnell Douglas was the sole supplier of Tomahawks, producing Block II and Block III versions and remanufacturing many Tomahawks to Block III specifications. In 1994, Hughes Aircraft, having purchased General Dynamics' missile division in 1992, outbid McDonnell Douglas to become the sole supplier of Tomahawks. A joint venture between Hughes and Raytheon manufactured the missile from 1995 until Raytheon's acquisition of Hughes in 1997, solidifying their position as the sole supplier. In 2016, the US Department of Defense purchased 149 Tomahawk Block IV missiles for $202.3 million. As of 2024[ [update]], Raytheon remains the sole manufacturer of non-nuclear, sea-launched Tomahawk variants.\nVariants.\nThe variants and multiple upgrades to the missile include:\nBGM-109G Gryphon Ground Launched Cruise Missiles (GLCM) and their truck-like launch vehicles were employed at bases in Europe; they were withdrawn from service to comply with the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. Many of the anti-ship versions were converted into TLAMs at the end of the Cold War. The Block III TLAMs that entered service in 1993 can fly farther using their new turbofan engines and use Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers to strike more precisely. Block III TLAM-Cs retain the Digital Scene Matching Area Correlation (DSMAC) II navigation system, allowing three kinds of navigation: GPS-only, which allow for rapid mission planning, with some reduced accuracy, DSMAC-only, which take longer to plan but terminal accuracy is somewhat better; and GPS-aided missions that combine DSMAC II and GPS navigation for greatest accuracy. Block IV TLAMs have an improved turbofan engine that allows them to get better fuel economy and change speeds in flight. The Block IV TLAMs can loiter better and have electro-optical sensors that allow real-time battle damage assessment. The Block IVs can be given a new target in flight and can transmit an image, via satcom, immediately before impact to help determine whether the missile is on target and the likely damage from the attack.\nUpgrades.\nA major improvement to the Tomahawk is network-centric warfare-capabilities, using data from multiple sensors (aircraft, UAVs, satellites, foot soldiers, tanks, ships) to find its target. It will also be able to send data from its sensors to these platforms.\n\"Tomahawk Block II\" variants were all tested during January 1981 to October 1983. Deployed in 1984, some of the improvements included: an improved booster rocket, cruise missile radar altimeter, and navigation through the Digital Scene Matching Area Corellator (DSMAC). DSMAC was a highly accurate rudimentary AI which allowed early low power computers to navigate and precisely target objectives using cameras on board the missile. With its ability to visually identify and aim directly at a target, it was more accurate than weapons using estimated GPS coordinates. Due to the very limited computer power of the day, DSMAC did not directly evaluate the maps, but instead would compute contrast maps and then combine multiple maps into a buffer, then compare the average of those combined images to determine if it was similar to the data in its small memory system. The data for the flight path was very low resolution in order to free up memory to be used for high resolution data about the target area. The guidance data was computed by a mainframe computer which took spy satellite photos and estimated what the terrain would appear like during low level flight. Since this data would not match the real terrain exactly, and since terrain changes seasonally and with changes in light quality, DSMAC would filter out differences between maps and use the remaining similar sections in order to find its location regardless of changes in how the ground appeared. It also had an extremely bright strobe light it could use to illuminate the ground for fractions of a second in order to find its position at night, and was able to take the difference in ground appearance into account.\n\"Tomahawk Block III\" introduced in 1993 added time-of-arrival control and improved accuracy for Digital Scene Matching Area Correlator (DSMAC) and jam-resistant GPS, smaller, lighter WDU-36 warhead, engine improvements and extended missile's range.\n\"Tactical Tomahawk Weapons Control System (TTWCS)\" takes advantage of a loitering feature in the missile's flight path and allows commanders to redirect the missile to an alternative target, if required. It can be reprogrammed in-flight to attack predesignated targets with GPS coordinates stored in its memory or to any other GPS coordinates. Also, the missile can send data about its status back to the commander. It entered service with the US Navy in late 2004. The Tactical Tomahawk Weapons Control System (TTWCS) added the capability for limited mission planning on board the firing unit (FRU).\n\"Tomahawk Block IV\" introduced in 2006 adds the strike controller which can change the missile in flight to one of 15 preprogrammed alternate targets or redirect it to a new target. This targeting flexibility includes the capability to loiter over the battlefield awaiting a more critical target. The missile can also transmit battle damage indication imagery and missile health and status messages via the two-way satellite data link. Firing platforms now have the capability to plan and execute GPS-only missions. Block IV also has an improved anti-jam GPS receiver for enhanced mission performance.\nBlock IV includes Tomahawk Weapons Control System (TTWCS), and Tomahawk Command and Control System (TC2S).\nOn 16 August 2010, the Navy completed the first live test of the Joint Multi-Effects Warhead System (JMEWS), a new warhead designed to give the Tomahawk the same blast-fragmentation capabilities while introducing enhanced penetration capabilities in a single warhead. In the static test, the warhead detonated and created a hole large enough for the follow-through element to completely penetrate the concrete target. In February 2014, US Central Command sponsored development and testing of the JMEWS, analyzing the ability of the programmable warhead to integrate onto the Block IV Tomahawk, giving the missile bunker buster effects to better penetrate hardened structures.\nIn 2012, the USN studied applying Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM) technology into the Tactical Tomahawk.\nIn 2014, Raytheon began testing Block IV improvements to attack sea and moving land targets. The new passive radar seeker will pick up the electromagnetic radar signature of a target and follow it, and actively send out a signal to bounce off potential targets before impact to discriminate its legitimacy before impact. Mounting the multi-mode sensor on the missile's nose would remove fuel space, but company officials believe the Navy would be willing to give up space for the sensor's new technologies. The previous Tomahawk Anti-Ship Missile, retired over a decade earlier, was equipped with inertial guidance and the seeker of the Harpoon missile and there was concern with its ability to clearly discriminate between targets from a long distance, since at the time Navy sensors did not have as much range as the missile itself, which would be more reliable with the new seeker's passive detection and millimeter-wave active radar homing. Raytheon estimates adding the new seeker would cost $250,000 per missile. Other upgrades include a sea-skimming flight path. The first Block IV TLAMs modified with a maritime attack capability were scheduled to enter service in 2021.\nA supersonic version of the Tomahawk is under consideration for development with a ramjet to increase its speed to Mach 3. A limiting factor to this is the dimensions of shipboard launch tubes. Instead of modifying every ship able to carry cruise missiles, the ramjet-powered Tomahawk would still have to fit within a diameter and long tube.\nIn October 2015, Raytheon announced the Tomahawk had demonstrated new capabilities in a test launch, using its onboard camera to take a reconnaissance photo and transmit it to fleet headquarters. It then entered a loitering pattern until given new targeting coordinates to strike.\nBy January 2016, Los Alamos National Laboratory was working on a project to turn unburned fuel left over when a Tomahawk reaches its target into an additional explosive force. To do this, the missile's JP-10 fuel is turned into a fuel air explosive to combine with oxygen in the air and burn rapidly. The thermobaric explosion of the burning fuel acts, in effect, as an additional warhead and can even be more powerful than the main warhead itself when there is sufficient fuel left in the case of a short-range target.\nTomahawk Block V was introduced in 2021 with improvements to navigation and in-flight targeting. Block Va, the Maritime Strike Tomahawk (MST) which allows the missile to engage a moving target at sea, and Block Vb outfitted with the JMEWS warhead for hard-target penetration, will be released after the initial batch of Block V is delivered in March 2021. In 2025, a spokesperson for the U.S. Navy's Tomahawk program announced that the MST would be operational on destroyers by the end of September that year, with deployment to attack submarines to follow in FY26. All Block IV Tomahawks will be converted to Block V standard, while the remaining Block III missiles will be retired and demilitarized.\nTomahawk Block V have longer range and dynamic targeting with the capability to hit vessels at sea (maritime strike role). Raytheon is recertifying and modernizing the missile, extending its service life by 15 years, and resulting in the new Tomahawk Block V series:\nIn 2020, Los Alamos National Laboratory reported that it would use corn ethanol to produce domestic fuel for Tomahawk missiles, which also does not require harsh acids to manufacture, compared to petroleum-based JP-10.\nLaunch systems.\nEach missile is stored and launched from a pressurized canister that protects it during transportation and storage, and also serves as a launch tube. These canisters were racked in Armored Box Launchers (ABL), which were installed on the four reactivated \"Iowa\"-class battleships , , , and . The ABLs were also installed on eight s, the four s, and the nuclear cruiser . These canisters are also in vertical launching systems (VLS) in other surface ships, capsule launch systems (CLS) in the later and s, and in submarines' torpedo tubes.\nAll ABL equipped ships have been decommissioned.\nFor submarine-launched missiles (called UGM-109s), after being ejected by gas pressure (vertically via the VLS) or by water impulse (horizontally via the torpedo tube), a solid-fuel booster is ignited to propel the missile and guide it out of the water.\nAfter achieving flight, the missile's wings are unfolded for lift, the airscoop is exposed and the turbofan engine is employed for cruise flight. Over water, the Tomahawk uses inertial guidance or GPS to follow a preset course; once over land, the missile's guidance system is aided by terrain contour matching (TERCOM). Terminal guidance is provided by the Digital Scene Matching Area Correlation (DSMAC) system or GPS, producing a claimed circular error probable of about .\nThe Tomahawk Weapon System consists of the missile, Theater Mission Planning Center (TMPC)/Afloat Planning System, and either the Tomahawk Weapon Control System (on surface ships) or Combat Control System (for submarines).\nSeveral versions of control systems have been used, including:\nOn 18 August 2019, the United States Navy conducted a test flight of a Tomahawk missile launched from a ground-based version of the Mark 41 Vertical Launch System. It was the United States' first acknowledged launch of a missile that would have violated the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, from which the Trump administration withdrew on 2 August after Russia broke it.\nThe United States Army has successfully launched a Tomahawk from the Typhon missile launcher.\nLatest launcher is the Extreme Multi-Mission Autonomous Vehicle (X-MAV) built by Oshkosh\nMunitions.\nThe TLAM-D contains 166 sub-munitions in 24 canisters: 22 canisters of seven each, and two canisters of six each to conform to the dimensions of the airframe. The sub-munitions are the same type of Combined Effects Munition bomblet used in large quantities by the US Air Force with the CBU-87 Combined Effects Munition. The sub-munitions canisters are dispensed two at a time, one per side. The missile can perform up to five separate target segments which enables it to attack multiple targets. However, in order to achieve a sufficient density of coverage typically all 24 canisters are dispensed sequentially from back to front.\nNavigation.\nTERCOM \u2013 Terrain Contour Matching. A digital representation of an area of terrain is mapped based on digital terrain elevation data or stereo imagery. This map is then inserted into a TLAM mission which is then loaded onto the missile. When the missile is in flight it compares the stored map data with radar altimeter data collected as the missile overflies the map. Based on comparison results the missile's inertial navigation system is updated and the missile corrects its course. TERCOM was based on, and was a significant improvement on, \"Fingerprint,\" a technology developed in 1964 for the SLAM.\nDSMAC \u2013 Digital Scene Matching Area Correlation. A digitized image of an area is mapped and then inserted into a TLAM mission. During the flight, the missile will verify that the images that it has stored correlates with the image it sees below itself. Based on comparison results, the missile's inertial navigation system is updated and the missile corrects its course.\nGPS \u2013 The Tomahawk relies on the Global Positioning Recognition System as a guidance mechanism.\nOperational history.\nUnited States.\nAir Force.\nThe Air Force is a former operator of the nuclear-armed version of the Tomahawk, the BGM-109G Gryphon.\nArmy.\nIn November 2020, the United States Army selected the Tomahawk to fulfill its Mid-Range Capability (MRC), giving it a land-based long-range missile capable of striking ground and sea targets. The Army plans to use the Tomahawk alongside a ground-based SM-6 and field them by late 2023.\nMarines.\nIn May 2022 the Defense Department announced a contract to buy Tomahawk missiles for the Navy, the Army, and the Marine Corps.\nUnited Kingdom.\n\u00a0Royal Navy\nIn 1995, the US agreed to sell 65 Tomahawks to the UK for torpedo-launch from their nuclear attack submarines. The first missiles were acquired and test-fired in November 1998; all Royal Navy fleet submarines are now Tomahawk capable, including the \"Astute\"-class. The Kosovo War in 1999 saw the Swiftsure-class HMS \"Splendid\" become the first British submarine to fire the Tomahawk in combat. The UK subsequently bought 20 more Block III to replenish stocks. The Royal Navy has since fired Tomahawks during the 2000s Afghanistan War, in Operation Telic as the British contribution to the 2003 Iraq War, and during Operation Ellamy in Libya in 2011.\nIn April 2004, the UK and US governments reached an agreement for the British to buy 64 of the new generation of Tomahawk missile\u2014the Block IV or TacTom missile. It entered service with the Royal Navy on 27 March 2008, three months ahead of schedule. In July 2014 the US approved the sale to the UK of a further 65 submarine-launched Block IV's at a cost of US$140m including spares and support; as of 2011[ [update]] the Block III missiles were on British books at \u00a31.1m and the Block IV at \u00a30.87m including VAT.\nThe Sylver Vertical Launching System on the new Type 45 destroyer is claimed by its manufacturers to have the capability to fire the Tomahawk, although the A50 launcher carried by the Type 45 is too short for the weapon (the longer A70 silo would be required). Nevertheless, the Type 45 has been designed with weight and space margin for a strike-length Mk41 or Sylver A70 silo to be retrofitted, allowing Type 45 to use the TLAM Block IV if required. Both the new Type 26 frigates and the Type 31 frigate will be filled with strike-length Mk41 VLS.\nIn June 2022, the UK announced it would be upgrading its Tomahawk cruise missiles to Block V standard through a \u00a3265 million contract with the US government. The missiles will be upgraded from 2024.\nAustralia.\n\u00a0Royal Australian Navy\nIn September 2021, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that Australia would acquire Tomahawks for the Royal Australian Navy's (RAN) \"Hobart\"-class air warfare destroyers. In March 2023, the US State Department approved a Foreign Military Sale to Australia of up 200 Block V and up to 20 Block IV missiles worth an estimated US$895 million. In January 2024, the US State Department approved the sale of support equipment worth US$250 million.\nIn December 2024, Australia's Minister for Defence said the RAN had successfully fired its first ever Tomahawk missile. The missile was fired from , a \"Hobart\"-class air warfare destroyer, making Australia the third nation, after the United States and UK, to acquire and fire the weapon.\nJapan.\n\u00a0Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force\nThe Japanese government is negotiating with the US government to purchase US-made Tomahawk cruise missiles for attacking enemy bases and counterattack purposes. The Japanese government decided to purchase the Tomahawk cruise missile before their domestic improved range \"Type 12 surface-to-ship missile\" start full-scale operation.Former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced Japan will be buying 400 Tomahawk missiles. They will be deployed in fiscal year 2026-27 and will serve as a bridge until the deployment of indigenous missiles like the extended range Type 12 surface-to-ship missile and the Hyper Velocity Gliding Projectile.\nThe United States Defense Security and Cooperation Agency announced on 17 November 2023 that the US State Department had approved a possible sale of up to 200 RGM-109E \"Tomahawk\" Block IV and up to 200 RGM-109E \"Tomahawk\" Block V LACMs to Japan for an estimated US$2.35 billion.\nNetherlands.\n\u00a0Royal Netherlands Navy\nAfter initial interest and planning (2005), the Dutch Ministry of Defence in 2023 confirmed ordering the ship launched- and submarine launched versions of the Tomahawk to be installed on both existing as well as future frigates &amp; submarines.\nIn 2022 plans for acquiring long-range and precision-guided weapon systems for the frigates and submarines of The Royal Netherlands Navy were announced as part of the Strategic Defence Review 2022, Tomahawk was identified. In March 2023, the commander of the Royal Netherlands Navy announced that the project to acquire maritime strike capability had been approved by the Ministry of Defence, and would include both the De Zeven Provinci\u00ebn-class frigates and the Walrus-class submarines. While initially no announcement on missile type was made, the Tomahawk was confirmed as the frigates and submarines are equipped with US-standard Mark 41 Vertical Launching System, and torpedo tubes suited for launching UGM-109 Tomahawk respectively. In April 2023, the Netherlands Ministry of Defence announced the procurement of Tomahawk missiles.\nOn 11 March 2025, the air defense and command frigate HNLMS \"De Ruyter\" launched a Tomahawk missile for the first time. This took place off the coast of Norfolk, United States. It was the first time a Dutch naval ship fired this type of missile.\nPotential operators.\nCanada.\n\u00a0Royal Canadian Navy\nAccording to infographics released by the Royal Canadian Navy in 2020, the new s will be equipped with the missile.\nGermany.\nTo comply with the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF Treaty), all nuclear and conventional ground-launched ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and missile launchers with ranges of (short to medium-range) and (intermediate-range) were dismantled or withdrawn from Europe by the treaty's deadline of 1 June 1991.\nOn 10 July 2024, a joint statement of the US and Germany was released, announcing the beginning of episodic deployments of long-range fires units with conventional warheads. Deployment will start from 2026, including Typhon missile launchers with SM-6 and Tomahawk missiles. This is considered as a direct response to Russia's President Vladimir Putin's call to resume production and global deployment of intermediate range missiles, two weeks prior. Putin accused the United States of already producing these missiles and pointed to the development and testing of the Typhon missile launcher. On 28 July 2024, Putin warned of a Cold War-style missile crisis and threatened to deploy long-range missiles within striking distance of the West after the United States announced its intention to deploy long-range missiles in Germany.

{"id": "31241", "revid": "34765295", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31241", "title": "Trigun", "text": "Japanese manga series\n is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yasuhiro Nightow. It was first serialized in Tokuma Shoten's manga magazine \"Monthly Sh\u014dnen Captain\" from March 1995 to December 1996, until the magazine ceased its publication; its chapters were collected in three volumes. The series continued its publication in Sh\u014dnen Gahosha's manga magazine \"Young King OURs\", under the title Trigun Maximum, from October 1997 to March 2007. Sh\u014dnen Gahosha republished the \"Trigun\" chapters in two volumes, and collected the \"Trigun Maximum\" chapters in 14 volumes.\nSet on the fictional planet known as No Man's Land, the plot follows Vash the Stampede, a famous gunman who is constantly fighting bounty hunters seeking to obtain the immense bounty on his head. As the narrative progresses, Vash's past is explored. \"Trigun\" originated from Nightow's fascination with Western movies. Nightow wanted Vash to be different from cowboys in Western movies by avoiding killing enemies and instead exploring the characters involved in each story arc.\n\"Trigun\" was adapted into a 26-episode anime television series by Madhouse; it aired on TV Tokyo from April to September 1998. An anime feature film, \"\", premiered in Japan in April 2010. A second anime television series adaptation produced by Orange, titled \"Trigun Stampede\", premiered in January 2023. In North America, both manga series have been licensed by Dark Horse Comics. The anime series was first licensed by Geneon Entertainment and started broadcast in the United States, as part of Cartoon Network's Adult Swim programming block, in 2003; the series was later licensed by Funimation.\nIn 2009, \"Trigun Maximum\" won the Best Comic category at the 40th Seiun Awards. Critical response to the manga has been generally positive based on Vash and his friends' actions and relationships, as well as the handling of action scenes. However, critics disliked Vash's predicament in regards to his pacifism and the plot being hard to understand. The anime series was similarly positively received.\nPlot.\nIn a distant future, a man known as \"Vash the Stampede\" has earned a bounty of $$60 billion (\"double dollar\") on his head and the nickname after accidentally destroying a city with his supernatural powers. However, whenever he is attacked, Vash displays a pacifist personality as noted by two Bernardelli Insurance Society employees, Meryl Stryfe and Milly Thompson, who follow him around in order to minimize the damages inevitably caused by his appearance. Most of the damage attributed to Vash is actually caused by bounty hunters in pursuit of the sixty billion double-dollar bounty on Vash's head for the destruction of the city of July. However, he cannot remember the incident due to retrograde amnesia, being able to recall only fragments of the destroyed city and memories of his childhood. Throughout his travels, Vash tries to save lives using non-lethal force. He is occasionally joined by a priest, Nicholas D. Wolfwood, who, like Vash, is a superb gunfighter with a mysterious past. As the series progresses, more about Vash's past and the history of human civilization on the planet is revealed.\nVash and his twin brother Knives were originally two children with a slow aging process found in a spaceship that escaped from the planet Earth after mankind had exhausted all its resources. Rem raised them, but Knives became nihilistic and had most of the people in the ship disposed of. As a result, Vash lives to find his twin and have revenge. Vash is targeted by Legato Bluesummers from the Gung-ho Guns assassins who are followers of Knives. Wolfwood himself is a Gung-Ho Gun but was hired to make sure Vash does not die and instead suffer. Vash and Knives both possess the Angel Arm, which Knives forced Vash to use in the series' beginning to destroy the town.\nVash eventually fights Knives, but is defeated. Wolfwood betrays Knives and saves Vash. In the aftermath, Wolfwood dies fighting one of the Gung-Hos; his friend, Livio, joins Vash's cause while grieving for his friend's death. As Knives approaches the city with the \"Ark\", a floating ship designed to leave humans without any resources and end life on the planet, Knives begins dueling with Vash. Throughout his past battles that required him to use the Angel's Arm, Vash has transformed into a regular human signified by his blond hair now turned black. Knives also starts losing the powers he stored with the Ark through Vash's actions. Vash then saves his brother from the vengeful ships from Earth. Following his defeat, Knives uses his last powers to help his weakened brother by creating a small fruit tree to feed him. After his brother's death, Vash continues his travels on the planet with Meryl and Milly.\nProduction.\nAfter leaving college, Yasuhiro Nightow had gone to work selling apartments for the housing corporation Sekisui House, but struggled to keep up with his manga drawing hobby. Reassured by some successes, including a serialized manga based on the popular video game franchise \"Samurai Spirits\" for \"Family Computer Magazine\", he quit his job to draw full-time. The series was conceptualized as a mix between Western and science fiction as Nightow found it not seen in Japan by the time he started writing \"Trigun\". To contrast Vash from the typical heroes in action films, Nightow portrayed him as a pacifist since he did not want his lead character to be a murderer. Throughout the story, Vash avoids killing enemies by disarming them and avoids inflicting mortal wounds during combat. His cheerful personality was used to highlight this trait with his catchphrase being: \"Hey, sorry. Love and peace?\" Other elements of the manga were based on real life. Wolfwood's name was taken from the lead singer as his image for the priest. He is also modeled on Tortoise Matsumoto from the band Ulfuls. In order to create \"warm\" environments, Nightow drew several eating scenes.\nIn the making of the manga, Nightow attempts to draw the fight scenes carefully as he has \"all these images running through my head of characters moving this way and that, and contorting into all sort sorts of amazing action poses, but thinking about it and putting it to paper are always two different things\". In regards to the narrative, Nightow uses a \"logical and intuitive manner\" as his in order to make readers being capable of following it. While Vash is the manga's protagonist, anime director Satoshi Nishimura used Meryl Stryfe as the main character. In the anime, she searches for the Humanoid Typhoon and initially does not believe it is Vash due to his childish behavior. To create suspense, writer Y\u014dsuke Kuroda suggested that Vash would not shoot a bullet until the fifth episode, which causes Meryl to realize he is the famous gunman.\nMedia.\nManga.\nWith the help of a publisher friend, Yasuhiro Nightow,\nfirst published a one-shot of \"Trigun\" in Tokuma Shoten's manga magazine \"Monthly Sh\u014dnen Captain\" on January 26, 1995; it began its regular serialization in the same magazine two months later on March 25. \"Monthly Sh\u014dnen Captain\" ceased publication on December 26, 1996, and the series was put on hiatus. Tokuma Shoten collected the \"Trigun\" chapters in three volumes, released from April 25, 1996, to January 20, 1999; Sh\u014dnen Gah\u014dsha republished the \"Trigun\" chapters in two volumes, released on June 2, 2000.\nWhen Nightow was approached by Sh\u014dnen Gah\u014dsha's manga magazine \"Young King OURs\", they were interested in him beginning a new work. Nightow, however, was troubled by the idea of leaving \"Trigun\" incomplete, and requested to be allowed to finish the series. The manga resumed its publication in the magazine, under the title , in the October 1997 issue. Nightow said that there was no difference in the story between the two titles, and that the only reason for the change was because of the switch of publishing house. \"Trigun Maximum\" finished in March 2007. Sh\u014dnen Gah\u014dsha collected its chapters in fourteen volumes, released from May 23, 1998, to February 27, 2008.\nIn North America, the manga was licensed by Dark Horse Comics, who announced its publication in June 2003; they released the two volumes of \"Trigun\", based on the Sh\u014dnen Gahosha's edition, on October 15, 2003, and January 7, 2004. In March 2004, Dark Horse Comics announced that they would also publish \"Trigun Maximum\"; the fourteen volumes were released from May 26, 2004, to April 8, 2009. In September 2012, \"Dark Horse Comics\" announced that they would release the series in an omnibus edition; \"Trigun\" was released in a single volume on October 9, 2013; \"Trigun Maximum\" was released in five volumes from November 21, 2012, to November 5, 2014.\nAn anthology manga titled \"Trigun: Multiple Bullets\", featuring short stories written by several manga artists such as Boichi, Masakazu Ishiguru, Satoshi Mizukami, Ark Performance, Yusuke Takeyama, Yuga Takauchi, and Akira Sagami, was released by Sh\u014dnen Gahosha in Japan on December 28, 2011. The volume was released by Dark Horse Comics on March 6, 2013.\nIn May 2023, Dark Horse Comics announced deluxe hardcover editions of \"Trigun\" and \"Trigun Maximum\". The volume collecting both volumes of \"Trigun\" was released on September 10, 2024, while the first volume of \"Trigun Maximum\" was released on October 8 of the same year.\nAnime.\n1998 series.\n\"Trigun\" was adapted into an anime television series. It was animated by Madhouse and directed by Satoshi Nishimura, written by Y\u014dsuke Kuroda, and produced by Shigeru Kitayama. The music was composed by Tsuneo Imahori. Twenty-six episodes aired on TV Tokyo from April 1 to September 30, 1998. The episodes were collected in thirteen VHS cassettes, labeled as \"Stages\", from August 5, 1998, to August 4, 1999.\nIn North America, the series was first licensed by Pioneer Entertainment (later Geneon USA) in 1999. Eight DVDs were released from March 28, 2000, to May 29, 2001. A box set containing all the episodes was released on November 20, 2001. The series premiered on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim programming block on March 31, 2003. The series also premiered in Canada on G4techTV's Anime Current programming block in 2007. In the same year, Geneon announced that they would cease their in-house distribution, In 2008, Funimation announced that they signed a deal with Geneon to distribute \"select\" titles from the company; in 2010, they announced that they had licensed \"Trigun\" for a DVD and Blu-ray Disc home video release, and launched it on October 26, 2010. Following the announcement that Funimation would be unified under the Crunchyroll brand, the series began streaming on the platform in May 2022.\n\"Trigun Stampede\".\nA second anime television series adaptation by Orange, titled \"Trigun Stampede\", premiered on January 7, 2023, on TV Tokyo and other networks.\nFilm.\nA \"Trigun\" film was originally announced in February 2008 to be released in 2009. The film titled \"Trigun: Badlands Rumble\" opened in theaters in Japan on April 24, 2010, and was first shown to an American audience at the Sakura-Con 2010 in Seattle, Washington on, April 2, 2010. At Anime Expo 2010, Funimation announced that they had licensed the film as they had with the TV series and planned to release it into theaters. The film made its US television premiere on Saturday, December 28, 2013, on Adult Swim's Toonami block.\nReception.\nManga.\n\"Trigun Maximum\" won the Best Comic at the 40th Seiun Award in the 48th Japan Science Fiction Convention in 2009. The second volume concluded the original series early the next year, and went on to be the top earning manga release of 2004. Critical response to the manga has been positive. \"Manga Life\" enjoyed the setting, comparing it to the American Midwest in the 1800s. They called the lead's characterization \"fantastic\" based on the personality he displays when facing enemies as he refuses to murder anybody. \"Anime News Network\" compared the series to \"Rurouni Kenshin\", based on both's pacifist messages to the audience and how challenging is this message explored in a similar fashion to comic book hero Batman. He also praised the fight scenes' handling as well as villains' designs. The clash between him and his antagonist was also praised for his execution and artwork. However, \"Mania Entertainment\" said some events that happened to Vash might come across as repetitive because his pacifism keeps backfiring and no proper solution has yet been given. As Vash's philosophy was tested in the finale, \"Fandom Post\" praised the consequences of his actions. While Vash and Knives' was popular, to the point \"Mania\" referred to their final fight as \"the stuff of legend.\" On the other hand, the book \"\" provided criticism to some parts of the narrative, finding it difficult to follow but still enjoyable. The artwork was also praised in the character designs with Wolfwood being called as one of the most stylish manga and anime characters.\nAnime.\nThe anime series is frequently listed as one of the best anime series of all time; in 2001, \"Wizard's Anime\" Magazine listed \"Trigun\" as the 38th best series on their \"Top 50 Anime released in North America\", and \"The Los Angeles Times\" journalist Charles Solomon named the series' complete box set as the seventh-best anime release of 2010. The success of the animated series increased the popularity of the original manga source material with the US release's first volume run of 35,000 sold out shortly after release. Theron Martin of \"Anime News Network\" gave the anime adaptation a B+, praising the series' writing: \"The series never wallows in the inherent to this format simply because the surprisingly high quality of its writing never allows that to happen.\" However, Martin was more critical of the anime's visuals, stating, \"Character rendering regularly looks more like rough drafts than refined final products, with the artists often struggling just to stay on model.\" Mike Toole of \"Anime News Network\" named \"Trigun\" as one of the most important anime of the 1990s.\n\"Escapist Magazine\" columnist H.D. Russell reviewed the anime adaptation of the series in early 2016, as part of the \"Good Old Anime Review\" section focusing on popular anime of the 1990s to early 2000s. Russell felt that the series' animation and English voice acting quality had aged poorly, but also argued that the depth of the characters and moral themes of the series more than compensate for its faults. He ultimately gave \"Trigun\" a rank of four out of a five stars, stating: \"\"Trigun\" is very often overshadowed by its close cousin \"Cowboy Bebop\", which is sad, because it truly is a delight to watch. Despite having only decent voice acting (with a few exceptions), average music, and relatively static visuals, \"Trigun\" is an absolute blast that had me laughing and thinking the whole way. While it's not perfect, it is fun and it does ask the questions that will make viewers ponder for years to come without ever offering them an answer. \"Trigun\" is one that went straight from my backlog to my heart and is truly greater than the sum of its parts.\" \"Trigun\" failed to garner a large audience in Japan during its original showing in 1998, but gained a substantial fan base following its United States premiere on Adult Swim in 2003, making it one of the rare examples of an anime that was more successful in the West than in its country of origin. Suggested causes of this disparity include the \"old west\" setting, European-style character names, and a lack of Japanese cultural elements.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The original series began with a six-episode OVA called . This original series was created by Masaki Kajishima and directed by Hiroki Hayashi, and it was released in Japan on September 25, 1992. The series was released by Pioneer LDC in the United Kingdom in 1994.\nAs its popularity grew, it spurred a seventh episode titled \"Tenchi Muyo! Special: The Night Before the Carnival\" (also known as the \"Tenchi Special\") and a stand-alone \"Tenchi Muyo! Mihoshi Special\". A second OVA series was directed by Kenichi Yatagai and was released in 1994. A third OVA series, which was also directed by Yatagai, was released in 2003. A fourth OVA series was produced in Japan, with the first collection released on November 30, 2016. The following episodes were planned to be released with an interval of three months each, and the final part of the series arrived August 30, 2017. On July 12, 2019, it was announced that a fifth OVA series is currently in development, with Masaki Kajishima again serving as chief director and Hideki Shirane writing and overseeing scripts.\nA twenty-six-episode anime television series called was released in 1995, and it was focused on retelling and expanding upon the original six-episode story. was created in 1997, and it is another alternate version of the original story. The latest version of the series called \"Ai Tenchi Muyo!\", was broadcast on Tokyo MX in 2014.\nSpin-off series of \"Tenchi Muyo!\" were also created. \"Magical Girl Pretty Sammy\" is an example that was adapted into a manga series. The franchise has also spawned soundtrack CDs and other merchandise released both in Japan and in the United States.\nConcept.\nMasaki Kajishima and Hiroki Hayashi cite the \"Bubblegum Crisis\" OVAs, which they both worked on, as being the inspiration for \"Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki\". In an interview with AIC, Hayashi described \"Bubblegum Crisis\" as \"a pretty gloomy anime. Serious fighting, complicated human relationships and dark Mega Tokyo.\" They thought it would be fun to create some comedy episodes with ideas like the girls going to the hot springs, but it was rejected by the sponsors. He also said that there was a trend to have a bunch of characters of one gender and a single one of the other gender, and asked what if Mackey (Sylia's brother) was a main character, reversing the \"Bubblegum\" scenario. This became the basis for \"Tenchi Muyo!\".\nIn designing Ryoko, Kajishima and Hayashi were inspired by the American sitcom \"I Dream of Jeannie\" and wanted to use her in their works. In the first episode, Tenchi would open the sealed cave, which was a reference to the Jeannie's bottle, and a \"cute witch\" would jump out. Hayashi said that Tenchi is \"sort of\" based on Mackey, and that after Tenchi and Ryoko, the other girls were designed to be characters to balance the picture in the very early concepts of the series, and that they are original characters.\nMedia.\nOVA.\nThe first OVA was titled \"Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki\" and was created by Masaki Kajishima. \"Ryo-Ohki\" comprises 5 OVA series to date. The fifth OVA released its last episode on May 28, 2021.\nManga.\nHitoshi Okuda wrote two manga series based on the OVA series. The first manga is titled and was published by Kadokawa Shoten and serialized in Dragon Comic Jr. magazine from December 16, 1994, to June 9, 2000. The series was collected into 12 tank\u014dbon volumes.\n\"No Need for Tenchi\" was released in English in the United States by Viz Communications, and in Singapore by Chuang Yi.\nThe second series titled was also published by Kadokawa Shoten and serialized in Dragon Comic Age magazine from July 26, 2000, to December 9, 2005. The series was collected into 10 tank\u014dbon volumes.\nTV series.\nAfter the first OVA series aired, AIC began looking into TV adaptations beyond the \"Mihoshi Special\". In 1995 , a 26-episode anime television series was created by Hiroshi Negishi, animated by AIC and produced by Pioneer. It was loosely based on the first six episodes of the OVA series and the \"Mihoshi Special\". Two years later, another AIC production followed suit called , which aired through 1997 and also ran 26 episodes. It borrowed characters and some plot devices from the previous incarnations, but with a noticeable art shift and very different concepts, such as centering on Tenchi's high school and being a priest in Tokyo. The most recent series aired in October 2014. The series commemorated the 20th anniversary of the franchise and was sponsored by the city of Takahashi, Okayama.\nFilms.\nAn anime film titled ', created by Hiroshi Negishi, is a continuation of the \"Tenchi Universe\" TV series. A second film, ', was adapted from a novel written by Naoko Hasegawa. The third film, titled \"Tenchi Forever! The Movie\", is the sequel to \"Tenchi Muyo in Love\" and was adapted into a manga titled \"Tenchi Muyo! In Love 2: Eternal Memory\".\nNovels.\nKajishima has written several books based on the franchise, including the ongoing \"Tenchi Muyo! GXP: Galaxy Police Transporter\" novel series, the novels \"Shin Tenchi Muyo! Jurai\", \"Shin Tenchi Muyo! Yosho\", and \"Shin Tenchi Muyo! Washu\", and recently, the \"Paradise Wars\" spinoff. There are also a number of d\u014djinshi by and interviews with Kajishima, as well as a companion book, \"101 Questions and Answers of Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Oh-Ki\". Naoko Hasegawa wrote a series of thirteen light novels continuing from the first OVA series, starting with \"One Visitor After Another: Hexagram Of Love\" in 1993.\nSeven Seas Entertainment has licensed the light novels \"Shin Tenchi Muyo! Jurai\", \"Shin Tenchi Muyo! Yosho\", \"Shin Tenchi Muyo! Washu\" for a North American release in 2017, and released them as \"True Tenchi Muyo!\" in 2018 and 2019.\nVideo games.\nNumerous video games have been released based on the franchise, such as \"Tenchi Muyo! Game Hen\" for the Super Famicom.\nRadio.\nA radio drama was released titled \"Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-ohki Manatsu no Carnival\".\nStage play.\nOn AnimeJapan 2019, it was announced on AIC Rights' booth that a stage play based on the first season of Ryo-Ohki was in development, scheduled to premiere in 2019. On May 17, the cast and staff was announced, with Kazuhiro Igarashi writing the script and Kazuma Sato starring as Tenchi Masaki. It ran from July 17 to the 21st on the Shinjukumura Live venue, in Tokyo.\nSpin-offs.\nThe first \"Tenchi\" spinoff is the \"Magical Girl Pretty Sammy\" series, a magical girl series where Sasami is the lead character. The first use of Pretty Sammy was in the \"Tenchi Muyo! Sound File\", a Japanese-only music video release. The same animation was used in the ending of the \"Tenchi Muyo! Mihoshi Special\". In 1995, a three episode \"Pretty Sammy\" OVA series began, where Sasami, who is known as Sasami Kawai, magically becomes Pretty Sammy. The second \"Pretty Sammy\" series is a TV series, which came out in 1996, also known as \"Magical Project S\". This series is in a separate continuity from the OVA series. Pretty Sammy also appears in the \"Mihoshi Special\" toward the end of Mihoshi's story, and in an alternate reality sequence in the \"Tenchi Universe\" series.\nAlso created by Masaki Kajishima, the 1997 OVA series \"\" is related to the \"Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki\" universe. \"Tenchi Muyo! War on Geminar\" from 2009 uses a number of elements from \"Photon\", such as Koros, Aho energy, having a princess named Lashara, and a young hero with such strong superhuman abilities he's practically invincible.\nAlso by Masaki Kajishima, the 1998 OVA series \"Spaceship Agga Ruter\" and its 1999 visual novel continuation \"Space Ofera Agga Ruter ~Kyoufu no Uchuu Majo~\" take place in \"Tenchi Muyo!\" universe.\nThe 1999 series \"Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure\" is related to the \"Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-ohki\" universe, due to the blatant use of the \"Lighthawk Wings\" associated with the Jurai dynasty in \"Tenchi Muyo\". The creator of both \"Dual!\" and \"Tenchi Muyo!\", Masaki Kajishima, confirmed that \"Dual!\" does relate to \"Tenchi Muyo!\", and is in fact an alternate version of the \"Tenchi Muyo!\" universe.\nGuardians of Order published a line of English-language \"Tenchi Muyo\" role-playing game books based on the various series in the Tenchi franchise starting in 2000.\n\"Tenchi Muyo! GXP\" was released in Japan in 2001. The series takes place during the Kajishima version of the OVA continuity, and is set a year after the events of the third OVA series (despite being released first chronologically). The main character is Seina Yamada, a friend of Tenchi Masaki who accidentally joined the Galaxy Police. Many characters from \"Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-ohki\" make appearances in this series, including the use of Seiryo Tennan as a major character and a full-fledged \"Tenchi Muyo!\" crossover in episode 17.\n\"Battle Programmer Shirase\" is a 2003 spin-off of the \"Pretty Sammy\" OVA and TV series, keeping the character Misao Amano from \"Pretty Sammy\", and with the main character Akira Shirase, Misao's great-uncle; however, it bears little in common with either \"Pretty Sammy\" series because it has neither magic, nor Sasami, nor Misao's alter ego Pixy Misa.\n\"\" aired in Japan in 2006. The third spin-off featuring Sasami (known here as Sasami Iwakura) as the main character.\nThe most recent \"Tenchi\" spin-off series is called \"Tenchi Muyo! War on Geminar\" (aka \"Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari\") which follows the tale of Tenchi's half-brother Kenshi Masaki as he finds himself in a foreign world that uses humanoid machines to fight their wars.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Electrical telegraphy had been developed decades earlier in the late 1830s and 1840s, then using simpler Morse key equipment and telegraph operators. The introduction of teleprinters automated much of this work and eventually largely replaced skilled operators versed in Morse code with typists and machines communicating faster via Baudot code.\nWith the development of early computers in the 1950s, teleprinters were adapted to allow typed data to be sent to a computer, and responses printed. Some teleprinter models could also be used to create punched tape for data storage (either from typed input or from data received from a remote source) and to read back such tape for local printing or transmission. A teleprinter attached to a modem could also communicate through telephone lines. This latter configuration was often used to connect teleprinters to remote computers, particularly in time-sharing environments.\nTeleprinters have largely been replaced by fully electronic computer terminals which typically have a computer monitor instead of a printer (though the term \"TTY\" is still occasionally used to refer to them, such as in Unix systems). Teleprinters are still widely used in the aviation industry (see AFTN and airline teletype system), and variants called Telecommunications Devices for the Deaf (TDDs) are used by the hearing impaired for typed communications over ordinary telephone lines.\nHistory.\nEarly developments (1835\u20131846).\nThe teleprinter evolved through a series of inventions by a number of people on both sides of the Atlantic ocean, including Samuel Morse, William Fothergill Cooke, Charles Wheatstone, Alexander Bain, Royal Earl House, David Edward Hughes, Emile Baudot, Donald Murray, Charles L. Krum, Edward Kleinschmidt and Frederick G. Creed.\nThere were a number of parallel developments on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. In 1835 Samuel Morse devised a recording telegraph, and Morse code was born. Morse's instrument used a current to displace the armature of an electromagnet, which moved a marker, therefore recording the breaks in the current. Cooke &amp; Wheatstone received a British patent covering telegraphy in 1837 and a second one in 1840 which described a type-printing telegraph with steel type fixed at the tips of petals of a rotating brass daisy-wheel, struck by an \"electric hammer\" to print Roman letters through carbon paper onto a moving paper tape. In 1841 Alexander Bain devised an electromagnetic printing telegraph machine. It used pulses of electricity created by rotating a dial over contact points to release and stop a type-wheel turned by weight-driven clockwork; a second clockwork mechanism rotated a drum covered with a sheet of paper and moved it slowly upwards so that the type-wheel printed its signals in a spiral. The critical issue was to have the sending and receiving elements working synchronously. Bain attempted to achieve this using centrifugal governors to closely regulate the speed of the clockwork. It was patented, along with other devices, on April 21, 1841.\nBy 1846, the Morse telegraph service was operational between Washington, D.C., and New York. Royal Earl House patented his printing telegraph that same year. He linked two 28-key piano-style keyboards by wire. Each piano key represented a letter of the alphabet and when pressed caused the corresponding letter to print at the receiving end. A \"shift\" key gave each main key two optional values. A 56-character typewheel at the sending end was synchronised to coincide with a similar wheel at the receiving end. If the key corresponding to a particular character was pressed at the home station, it actuated the typewheel at the distant station just as the same character moved into the printing position, in a way similar to the (much later) daisy wheel printer. It was thus an example of a synchronous data transmission system. House's equipment could transmit around 40 instantly readable words per minute, but was difficult to manufacture in bulk. The printer could copy and print out up to 2,000 words per hour. This invention was first put in operation and exhibited at the Mechanics Institute in New York in 1844.\nEarly teleprinters (1849\u20131897).\nLandline teleprinter operations began in 1849, when a circuit was put in service between Philadelphia and New York City.\nIn 1855, David Edward Hughes introduced an improved machine built on the work of Royal Earl House. In less than two years, a number of small telegraph companies, including Western Union in early stages of development, united to form one large corporation \u2013 Western Union Telegraph Co. \u2013 to carry on the business of telegraphy on the Hughes system.\nIn France, \u00c9mile Baudot designed in 1874 a system using a five-unit code, which began to be used extensively in that country from 1877. The British Post Office adopted the Baudot system for use on a simplex circuit between London and Paris in 1897, and subsequently made considerable use of duplex Baudot systems on their Inland Telegraph Services.\nTwentieth century developments.\nIn 1901, Baudot's code was modified by Donald Murray (1865\u20131945, originally from New Zealand), prompted by his development of a typewriter-like keyboard. The Murray system employed an intermediate step, a keyboard perforator, which allowed an operator to punch a paper tape, and a tape transmitter for sending the message from the punched tape. At the receiving end of the line, a printing mechanism would print on a paper tape, and/or a reperforator could be used to make a perforated copy of the message. As there was no longer a direct correlation between the operator's hand movement and the bits transmitted, there was no concern about arranging the code to minimize operator fatigue, and instead Murray designed the code to minimize wear on the machinery, assigning the code combinations with the fewest punched holes to the most frequently used characters. The Murray code also introduced what became known as \"format effectors\" or \"control characters\" \u2013 the CR (Carriage Return) and LF (Line Feed) codes. A few of Baudot's codes moved to the positions where they have stayed ever since: the NULL or BLANK and the DEL code. NULL/BLANK was used as an idle code for when no messages were being sent.\nIn the United States in 1902, electrical engineer Frank Pearne approached Joy Morton, head of Morton Salt, seeking a sponsor for research into the practicalities of developing a printing telegraph system. Joy Morton needed to determine whether this was worthwhile and so consulted mechanical engineer Charles L. Krum, who was vice president of the Western Cold Storage Company. Krum was interested in helping Pearne, so space was set up in a laboratory in the attic of Western Cold Storage. Frank Pearne lost interest in the project after a year and left to get involved in teaching. Krum was prepared to continue Pearne\u2019s work, and in August, 1903 a patent was filed for a 'typebar page printer'. In 1904, Krum filed a patent for a 'type wheel printing telegraph machine' which was issued in August, 1907. In 1906 Charles Krum's son, Howard Krum, joined his father in this work. It was Howard who developed and patented the start-stop synchronizing method for code telegraph systems, which made possible the practical teleprinter.\nIn 1908, a working teleprinter was produced by the Morkrum Company (formed between Joy Morton and Charles Krum), called the Morkrum Printing Telegraph, which was field tested with the Alton Railroad. In 1910, the Morkrum Company designed and installed the first commercial teletypewriter system on Postal Telegraph Company lines between Boston and New York City using the \"Blue Code Version\" of the Morkrum Printing Telegraph.\nTeleprinters were invented in order to send and receive messages without the need for operators trained in the use of Morse code. A system of two teleprinters, with one operator trained to use a keyboard, replaced two trained Morse code operators. The teleprinter system improved message speed and delivery time, making it possible for messages to be flashed across a country with little manual intervention.\nIn 1916, Edward Kleinschmidt filed a patent application for a typebar page printer. In 1919, shortly after the Morkrum company obtained their patent for a start-stop synchronizing method for code telegraph systems, which made possible the practical teleprinter, Kleinschmidt filed an application titled \"Method of and Apparatus for Operating Printing Telegraphs\" which included an improved start-stop method. The basic start-stop procedure, however, is much older than the Kleinschmidt and Morkrum inventions. It was already proposed by D'Arlincourt in 1870.\nInstead of wasting time and money in patent disputes on the start-stop method, Kleinschmidt and the Morkrum Company decided to merge and form the Morkrum-Kleinschmidt Company in 1924. The new company combined the best features of both their machines into a new typewheel printer for which Kleinschmidt, Howard Krum, and Sterling Morton jointly obtained a patent.\nIn 1924 Britain's Creed &amp; Company, founded by Frederick G. Creed, entered the teleprinter field with their Model 1P, a page printer, which was soon superseded by the improved Model 2P. In 1925 Creed acquired the patents for Donald Murray's Murray code, a rationalised Baudot code. The Model 3 tape printer, Creed\u2019s first combined start-stop machine, was introduced in 1927 for the Post Office telegram service. This machine printed received messages directly on to gummed paper tape at a rate of 65 words per minute. Creed created his first keyboard perforator, which used compressed air to punch the holes. He also created a reperforator (receiving perforator) and a printer. The reperforator punched incoming Morse signals on to paper tape and the printer decoded this tape to produce alphanumeric characters on plain paper. This was the origin of the Creed High Speed Automatic Printing System, which could run at an unprecedented 200 words per minute. His system was adopted by the Daily Mail for daily transmission of the newspaper's contents. The Creed Model 7 page printing teleprinter was introduced in 1931 and was used for the inland Telex service. It worked at a speed of 50 baud, about 66 words a minute, using a code based on the Murray code.\nA teleprinter system was installed in the Bureau of Lighthouses, Airways Division, Flight Service Station Airway Radio Stations system in 1928, carrying administrative messages, flight information and weather reports. By 1938, the teleprinter network, handling weather traffic, extended over 20,000 miles, covering all 48 states except Maine, New Hampshire, and South Dakota.\nWays in which teleprinters were used.\nTeleprinters could use a variety of different communication channels. These included a simple pair of wires, public switched telephone networks, dedicated non-switched telephone circuits (leased lines), switched networks that operated similarly to the public telephone network (telex), and radio and microwave links (telex-on-radio, or TOR). \nThere were at least five major types of teleprinter networks:\nBefore the computer revolution (and information processing performance improvements thanks to Moore's law) made it possible to securely encrypt voice and video calls, teleprinters were long used in combination with electromechanical or electronic cryptographic devices to provide secure communication channels. Being limited to text only was an acceptable trade-off for security.\nTeleprinter operation.\nMost teleprinters used the 5-bit International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 (ITA2). This was limited to 32 codes (25 = 32), which was insufficient to encode all the alphabet as well as numbers and other characters. Therefore, the keyboard used the \"FIGS\" (for \"figures\") and \"LTRS\" (for \"letters\") keys to allow two encoding states, with a total of 60 codes by sending one of two reserved characters to indicate the state of the following encoded stream (the letters were single case only). Special versions of teleprinters had FIGS characters for specific applications, such as weather symbols for weather reports. The ITA2 code was used asynchronously with start and stop bits: the asynchronous code design was intimately linked with the start-stop electro-mechanical design of teleprinters. (Early systems had used synchronous codes, but were hard to synchronize mechanically). Other codes, such as FIELDATA and Flexowriter, were introduced but never became as popular as ITA2.\n\"Mark\" and \"space\" are terms describing logic levels in teleprinter circuits. The native mode of communication for a teleprinter is a simple series DC circuit that is interrupted, much as a rotary dial interrupts a telephone signal. The marking condition is when the circuit is closed (current is flowing), the spacing condition is when the circuit is open (no current is flowing). The \"idle\" condition of the circuit is a continuous marking state, with the start of a character signalled by a \"start bit\", which is always a space. Following the start bit, the character is represented by a fixed number of bits, such as 5 bits in the ITA2 code, each either a mark or a space to denote the specific character or machine function. After the character's bits, the sending machine sends one or more stop bits. The stop bits are marking, so as to be distinct from the subsequent start bit. If the sender has nothing more to send, the line simply remains in the marking state (as if a continuing series of stop bits) until a later space denotes the start of the next character. The time between characters need not be an integral multiple of a bit time, but it must be at least the minimum number of stop bits required by the receiving machine.\nWhen the line is broken, the continuous spacing (open circuit, no current flowing) causes a receiving teleprinter to cycle continuously, even in the absence of stop bits. It prints nothing because the characters received are all zeros, the ITA2 blank (or ASCII) null character.\nTeleprinter circuits were generally leased from a communications common carrier and consisted of ordinary telephone cables that extended from the teleprinter located at the customer location to the common carrier central office. These teleprinter circuits were connected to switching equipment at the central office for Telex and TWX service. Private line teleprinter circuits were not directly connected to switching equipment. Instead, these private line circuits were connected to network hubs and repeaters configured to provide point to point or point to multipoint service. More than two teleprinters could be connected to the same wire circuit by means of a current loop.\nEarlier teleprinters had three rows of keys and only supported upper case letters. They used the 5 bit ITA2 code and generally worked at 60 to 100 words per minute. Later teleprinters, specifically the Teletype Model 33, used ASCII code, an innovation that came into widespread use in the 1960s as computers became more widely available.\n\"Speed\", intended to be roughly comparable to words per minute, is the standard term introduced by Western Union for a mechanical teleprinter data transmission rate using the 5-bit ITA2 code that was popular in the 1940s and several decades thereafter. Such a machine would send 1 start bit, 5 data bits, and 1.42 stop bits. This unusual stop bit time is actually a rest period to allow the mechanical printing mechanism to synchronize in the event that a garbled signal is received. This is true especially on high frequency radio circuits, where selective fading is present. Selective fading causes the mark signal amplitude to be randomly different from the space signal amplitude. Selective fading, or Rayleigh fading can cause two carriers to randomly and independently fade to different depths. Since modern computer equipment cannot easily generate 1.42 bits for the stop period, common practice is to either approximate this with 1.5 bits, or to send 2.0 bits while accepting 1.0 bits receiving.\nFor example, a \"60 speed\" machine is geared at 45.5 baud (22.0 ms per bit), a \"66 speed\" machine is geared at 50.0 baud (20.0 ms per bit), a \"75 speed\" machine is geared at 56.9 baud (17.5 ms per bit), a \"100 speed\" machine is geared at 74.2 baud (13.5 ms per bit), and a \"133 speed\" machine is geared at 100.0 baud (10.0 ms per bit). 60 speed became the \"de facto\" standard for amateur radio RTTY operation because of the widespread availability of equipment at that speed and the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) restrictions to only 60 speed from 1953 to 1972. Telex, news agency wires and similar services commonly used 66 speed services. There was some migration to 75 and 100 speed as more reliable devices were introduced. However, the limitations of HF transmission such as excessive error rates due to multipath distortion and the nature of ionospheric propagation kept many users at 60 and 66 speed. Most audio recordings in existence today are of teleprinters operating at 60 words per minute, and mostly of the Teletype Model 15.\nAnother measure of the speed of a teletypewriter was in total \"operations per minute (OPM)\". For example, 60 speed was usually 368 OPM, 66 speed was 404 OPM, 75 speed was 460 OPM, and 100 speed was 600 OPM. Western Union Telexes were usually set at 390 OPM, with 7.0 total bits instead of the customary 7.42 bits.\nBoth wire-service and private teleprinters had bells to signal important incoming messages and could ring 24/7 while the power was turned on. For example, ringing 4 bells on UPI wire-service machines meant an \"Urgent\" message; 5 bells was a \"Bulletin\"; and 10 bells was a FLASH, used only for very important news.\nThe teleprinter circuit was often linked to a 5-bit paper tape punch (or \"reperforator\") and reader, allowing messages received to be resent on another circuit. Complex military and commercial communications networks were built using this technology. Message centers had rows of teleprinters and large racks for paper tapes awaiting transmission. Skilled operators could read the priority code from the hole pattern and might even feed a \"FLASH PRIORITY\" tape into a reader while it was still coming out of the punch. Routine traffic often had to wait hours for relay. Many teleprinters had built-in paper tape readers and punches, allowing messages to be saved in machine-readable form and edited off-line.\nCommunication by radio, known as \"radioteletype\" or \"RTTY\" (pronounced \"ritty\"), was also common, especially among military users. Ships, command posts (mobile, stationary, and even airborne) and logistics units took advantage of the ability of operators to send reliable and accurate information with a minimum of training. Amateur radio operators continue to use this mode of communication today, though most use computer-interface sound generators, rather than legacy hardware teleprinter equipment. Numerous modes are in use within the \"ham radio\" community, from the original ITA2 format to more modern, faster modes, which include error-checking of characters.\nControl characters.\nA typewriter or electromechanical printer can print characters on paper, and execute operations such as move the carriage back to the left margin of the same line (carriage return), advance to the same column of the next line (line feed), and so on. Commands to control non-printing operations were transmitted in exactly the same way as printable characters by sending control characters with defined functions (e.g., the \"line feed\" character forced the carriage to move to the same position on the next line) to teleprinters. In modern computing and communications a few control characters, such as carriage return and line feed, have retained their original functions (although they are often implemented in software rather than activating electromechanical mechanisms to move a physical printer carriage) but many others are no longer required and are used for other purposes.\nAnswer back mechanism.\nSome teleprinters had a \"Here is\" key, which transmitted a fixed sequence of 20 or 22 characters, programmable by breaking tabs off a drum. This sequence could also be transmitted automatically upon receipt of an ENQ (control E) signal, if enabled. This was commonly used to identify a station; the operator could press the key to send the station identifier to the other end, or the remote station could trigger its transmission by sending the ENQ character, essentially asking \"who are you?\"\nManufacturers.\nCreed &amp; Company.\nBritish Creed &amp; Company built teleprinters for the GPO's teleprinter service.\nGretag.\nThe Gretag ETK-47 teleprinter developed in Switzerland by Edgar Gretener in 1947 uses a 14-bit start-stop transmission method similar to the 5-bit code used by other teleprinters. However, instead of a more-or-less arbitrary mapping between 5-bit codes and letters in the Latin alphabet, all characters (letters, digits, and punctuation) printed by the ETK are built from 14 basic elements on a print head, very similar to the 14 elements on a modern fourteen-segment display, each one selected independently by one of the 14 bits during transmission. Because it does not use a fixed character set, but instead builds up characters from smaller elements, the ETK printing element does not require modification to switch between Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek characters.\nKleinschmidt Labs.\nIn 1931, American inventor Edward Kleinschmidt formed Kleinschmidt Labs to pursue a different design of teleprinter. In 1944 Kleinschmidt demonstrated their lightweight unit to the Signal Corps and in 1949 their design was adopted for the Army's portable needs. In 1956, Kleinschmidt Labs merged with Smith-Corona, which then merged with the Marchant Calculating Machine Co., forming the SCM Corporation. By 1979, the Kleinschmidt division was turning to Electronic Data Interchange and away from mechanical products.\nKleinschmidt machines, with the military as their primary customer, used standard military designations for their machines. The teleprinter was identified with designations such as a TT-4/FG, while communication \"sets\" to which a teleprinter might be a part generally used the standard Army/Navy designation system such as AN/FGC-25. This includes Kleinschmidt teleprinter TT-117/FG and tape reperforator TT-179/FG.\nMorkrum.\nMorkrum made their first commercial installation of a printing telegraph with the Postal Telegraph Company in Boston and New York in 1910. It became popular with railroads, and the Associated Press adopted it in 1914 for their wire service. Morkrum merged with their competitor Kleinschmidt Electric Company to become Morkrum-Kleinschmidt Corporation shortly before being renamed the Teletype Corporation.\nOlivetti.\nItalian office equipment maker Olivetti (est. 1908) started to manufacture teleprinters in order to provide Italian post offices with modern equipment to send and receive telegrams. The first models typed on a paper ribbon, which was then cut and glued into telegram forms.\nSiemens &amp; Halske.\nSiemens &amp; Halske, later Siemens, a German company, founded in 1847.\nTeletype Corporation.\nThe Teletype Corporation, a part of American Telephone and Telegraph Company's Western Electric manufacturing arm since 1930, was founded in 1906 as the Morkrum Company. In 1925, a merger between Morkrum and Kleinschmidt Electric Company created the Morkrum-Kleinschmidt Company. The name was changed in December 1928 to Teletype Corporation. In 1930, Teletype Corporation was purchased by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and became a subsidiary of Western Electric. In 1984, the divestiture of the Bell System resulted in the Teletype name and logo being replaced by the AT&amp;T name and logo, eventually resulting in the brand being extinguished. The last vestiges of what had been the Teletype Corporation ceased in 1990, bringing to a close the dedicated teleprinter business. Despite its long-lasting trademark status, the word \"Teletype\" went into common generic usage in the news and telecommunications industries. Records of the United States Patent and Trademark Office indicate the trademark has expired and is considered dead.\nTeletype machines tended to be large, heavy, and extremely robust, capable of running non-stop for months at a time if properly lubricated. The Model 15 stands out as one of a few machines that remained in production for many years. It was introduced in 1930 and remained in production until 1963, a total of 33 years of continuous production. Very few complex machines can match that record. The production run was stretched somewhat by World War II\u2014the Model 28 was scheduled to replace the Model 15 in the mid-1940s, but Teletype built so many factories to produce the Model 15 during World War II, it was more economical to continue mass production of the Model 15. The Model 15, in its receive only, no keyboard, version was the classic \"news Teletype\" for decades.\nSeveral different high-speed printers like the \"Ink-tronic\" etc.\nTexas Instruments.\nTexas Instruments developed its own line of teletypes in 1971, the Silent 700. Their name came from the use of a thermal printer head to emit copy, making them substantially quieter than contemporary teletypes using impact printing, and some such as the 1975 Model 745 and 1983 Model 707 were even small enough to be sold as portable units. Certain models came with acoustic couplers and some had internal storage, initially cassette tape in the 1973 Models 732/733 ASR and later bubble memory in the 1977 Models 763/765, the first and one of the few commercial products to use the technology. In these units their storage capability essentially acted as a form of punched tape. The last Silent 700 was the 1987 700/1200 BPS, which was sold into the early 1990s.\nTelex.\nA global teleprinter network called \"Telex\" was developed in the late 1920s, and was used through most of the 20th century for business communications. The main difference from a standard teleprinter is that Telex includes a switched routing network, originally based on pulse-telephone dialing, which in the United States was provided by Western Union. AT&amp;T developed a competing network called \"TWX\" which initially also used rotary dialing and Baudot code, carried to the customer premises as pulses of DC on a metallic copper pair. TWX later added a second ASCII-based service using Bell 103 type modems served over lines whose physical interface was identical to regular telephone lines. In many cases, the TWX service was provided by the same telephone central office that handled voice calls, using class of service to prevent POTS customers from connecting to TWX customers. Telex is still in use in some countries for certain applications such as shipping, news, weather reporting and military command. Many business applications have moved to the Internet as most countries have discontinued telex/TWX services.\nTeletypesetter.\nIn addition to the 5-bit Baudot code and the much later seven-bit ASCII code, there was a six-bit code known as the Teletypesetter code (TTS) used by news wire services. It was first demonstrated in 1928 and began to see widespread use in the 1950s. Through the use of \"shift in\" and \"shift out\" codes, this six-bit code could represent a full set of upper and lower case characters, digits, symbols commonly used in newspapers, and typesetting instructions such as \"flush left\" or \"center\", and even \"auxiliary font\", to switch to italics or bold type, and back to roman (\"upper rail\").\nThe TTS produces aligned text, taking into consideration character widths and column width, or line length.\nA Model 20 Teletype machine with a paper tape punch (\"reperforator\") was installed at subscriber newspaper sites. Originally these machines would simply punch paper tapes and these tapes could be read by a tape reader attached to a \"Teletypesetter operating unit\" installed on a Linotype machine. The \"operating unit\" was essentially a tape reader which actuated a mechanical box, which in turn operated the Linotype's keyboard and other controls, in response to the codes read from the tape, thus creating type for printing in newspapers and magazines.\nThis allowed higher production rates for the Linotype, and was used both locally, where the tape was first punched and then fed to the machine, as well as remotely, using tape transmitters and receivers.\nRemote use played an essential role for distributing identical content, such as syndicated columns, news agency news, classified advertising, and more, to different publications across wide geographical areas.\nIn later years the incoming 6-bit current loop signal carrying the TTS code was connected to a minicomputer or mainframe for storage, editing, and eventual feed to a phototypesetting machine.\nTeleprinters in computing.\nComputers used teleprinters for input and output from the early days of computing. Punched card readers and fast printers replaced teleprinters for most purposes, but teleprinters continued to be used as interactive time-sharing terminals until video displays became widely available in the late 1970s.\nUsers typed commands after a prompt character was printed. Printing was unidirectional; if the user wanted to delete what had been typed, further characters were printed to indicate that previous text had been cancelled. When video displays first became available the user interface was initially exactly the same as for an electromechanical printer; expensive and scarce video terminals could be used interchangeably with teleprinters. This was the origin of the text terminal and the command-line interface.\nPaper tape was sometimes used to prepare input for the computer session off line and to capture computer output. The popular Teletype Model 33 used 7-bit ASCII code (with an eighth parity bit) instead of Baudot. The common modem communications settings, \"Start/Stop Bits\" and \"Parity,\" stem from the ASCII era.\nIn early operating systems such as Digital's RT-11, serial communication lines were often connected to teleprinters and were given device names starting with tt. This and similar conventions were adopted by many other operating systems. Unix and Unix-like operating systems use the prefix tty, for example /dev/tty13, or pty (for pseudo-tty), such as /dev/ptya0, but some of them (e.g. Solaris &amp; recent Linux) have replaced pty files by a pts folder (where \"pt\" stands for \"pseudoterminal\" instead). In many computing contexts, \"TTY\" has become the name for any text terminal, such as an external console device, a user dialing into the system on a modem on a serial port device, a printing or graphical computer terminal on a computer's serial port or the RS-232 port on a USB-to-RS-232 converter attached to a computer's USB port, or even a terminal emulator application in the window system using a pseudoterminal device.\nTeleprinters were also used to record fault printout and other information in some TXE telephone exchanges.\nObsolescence of teleprinters.\nAlthough printing news, messages, and other text at a distance is still universal, the dedicated teleprinter tied to a pair of leased copper wires was made functionally obsolete by the fax, personal computer, inkjet printer, email, and the Internet.\nIn the 1980s, packet radio became the most common form of digital communications used in amateur radio. Soon, advanced multimode electronic interfaces such as the AEA PK-232 were developed, which could send and receive not only packet, but various other modulation types including Baudot. This made it possible for a home or laptop computer to replace teleprinters, saving money, complexity, space and the massive amount of paper which mechanical machines used.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Thus, it is possible that the worst-case running time for any algorithm for the TSP increases superpolynomially (but no more than exponentially) with the number of cities.\nThe problem was first formulated in 1930 and is one of the most intensively studied problems in optimization. It is used as a benchmark for many optimization methods. Even though the problem is computationally difficult, many heuristics and exact algorithms are known, so that some instances with tens of thousands of cities can be solved completely, and even problems with millions of cities can be approximated within a small fraction of 1%.\nThe TSP has several applications even in its purest formulation, such as planning, logistics, and the manufacture of microchips. Slightly modified, it appears as a sub-problem in many areas, such as DNA sequencing. In these applications, the concept \"city\" represents, for example, customers, soldering points, or DNA fragments, and the concept \"distance\" represents travelling times or cost, or a similarity measure between DNA fragments. The TSP also appears in astronomy, as astronomers observing many sources want to minimize the time spent moving the telescope between the sources; in such problems, the TSP can be embedded inside an optimal control problem. In many applications, additional constraints such as limited resources or time windows may be imposed.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nThe origins of the travelling salesman problem are unclear. A handbook for travelling salesmen from 1832 mentions the problem and includes example tours through Germany and Switzerland, but contains no mathematical treatment.\nThe TSP was mathematically formulated in the 19th century by the Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton and by the British mathematician Thomas Kirkman. Hamilton's icosian game was a recreational puzzle based on finding a Hamiltonian cycle. The general form of the TSP appears to have been first studied by mathematicians during the 1930s in Vienna and at Harvard, notably by Karl Menger, who defines the problem, considers the obvious brute-force algorithm, and observes the non-optimality of the nearest neighbour heuristic:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We denote by \"messenger problem\" (since in practice this question should be solved by each postman, anyway also by many travelers) the task to find, for finitely many points whose pairwise distances are known, the shortest route connecting the points. Of course, this problem is solvable by finitely many trials. Rules which would push the number of trials below the number of permutations of the given points, are not known. The rule that one first should go from the starting point to the closest point, then to the point closest to this, etc., in general does not yield the shortest route.\nIt was first considered mathematically in the 1930s by Merrill M. Flood, who was looking to solve a school bus routing problem. Hassler Whitney at Princeton University generated interest in the problem, which he called the \"48 states problem\". The earliest publication using the phrase \"travelling [or traveling] salesman problem\" was the 1949 RAND Corporation report by Julia Robinson, \"On the Hamiltonian game (a traveling salesman problem).\"\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, the problem became increasingly popular in scientific circles in Europe and the United States after the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica offered prizes for steps in solving the problem. Notable contributions were made by George Dantzig, Delbert Ray Fulkerson, and Selmer M. Johnson from the RAND Corporation, who expressed the problem as an integer linear program and developed the cutting plane method for its solution. They wrote what is considered the seminal paper on the subject in which, with these new methods, they solved an instance with 49 cities to optimality by constructing a tour and proving that no other tour could be shorter. Dantzig, Fulkerson, and Johnson, however, speculated that, given a near-optimal solution, one may be able to find optimality or prove optimality by adding a small number of extra inequalities (cuts). They used this idea to solve their initial 49-city problem using a string model. They found they only needed 26 cuts to come to a solution for their 49 city problem. While this paper did not give an algorithmic approach to TSP problems, the ideas that lay within it were indispensable to later creating exact solution methods for the TSP, though it would take 15 years to find an algorithmic approach in creating these cuts. As well as cutting plane methods, Dantzig, Fulkerson, and Johnson used branch-and-bound algorithms perhaps for the first time.\nIn 1959, Jillian Beardwood, J.H. Halton, and John Hammersley published an article entitled \"The Shortest Path Through Many Points\" in the journal of the Cambridge Philosophical Society. The Beardwood\u2013Halton\u2013Hammersley theorem provides a practical solution to the travelling salesman problem. The authors derived an asymptotic formula to determine the length of the shortest route for a salesman who starts at a home or office and visits a fixed number of locations before returning to the start.\nIn the following decades, the problem was studied by many researchers from mathematics, computer science, chemistry, physics, and other sciences. In the 1960s, however, a new approach was created that, instead of seeking optimal solutions, would produce a solution whose length is provably bounded by a multiple of the optimal length, and in doing so would create lower bounds for the problem; these lower bounds would then be used with branch-and-bound approaches. One method of doing this was to create a minimum spanning tree of the graph and then double all its edges, which produces the bound that the length of an optimal tour is at most twice the weight of a minimum spanning tree.\nIn 1976, Christofides and Serdyukov (independently of each other) made a big advance in this direction: the Christofides\u2013Serdyukov algorithm yields a solution that, in the worst case, is at most 1.5 times longer than the optimal solution. As the algorithm was simple and quick, many hoped it would give way to a near-optimal solution method. However, this hope for improvement did not immediately materialize, and the Christofides\u2013Serdyukov algorithm remained the method with the best worst-case scenario until 2011, when a (very) slightly improved approximation algorithm was developed for the subset of \"graphical\" TSPs. In 2020, this tiny improvement was extended to the full (metric) TSP.\nRichard M. Karp showed in 1972 that the Hamiltonian cycle problem was NP-complete, which implies the NP-hardness of TSP. This supplied a mathematical explanation for the apparent computational difficulty of finding optimal tours.\nGreat progress was made in the late 1970s and 1980, when Gr\u00f6tschel, Padberg, Rinaldi and others managed to exactly solve instances with up to 2,392 cities, using cutting planes and branch-and-bound.\nIn the 1990s, Applegate, Bixby, Chv\u00e1tal, and Cook developed the program \"Concorde\" that has been used in many recent record solutions. Gerhard Reinelt published the TSPLIB in 1991, a collection of benchmark instances of varying difficulty, which has been used by many research groups for comparing results. In 2006, Cook and others computed an optimal tour through an 85,900-city instance given by a microchip layout problem, currently the largest solved TSPLIB instance. For many other instances with millions of cities, solutions can be found that are guaranteed to be within 2\u20133% of an optimal tour.\nDescription.\nAs a graph problem.\nTSP can be modeled as an undirected weighted graph, such that cities are the graph's vertices, paths are the graph's edges, and a path's distance is the edge's weight. It is a minimization problem starting and finishing at a specified vertex after having visited each other vertex exactly once. Often, the model is a complete graph (i.e., each pair of vertices is connected by an edge). If no path exists between two cities, then adding a sufficiently long edge will complete the graph without affecting the optimal tour.\nAsymmetric and symmetric.\nIn the \"symmetric TSP\", the distance between two cities is the same in each opposite direction, forming an undirected graph. This symmetry halves the number of possible solutions. In the \"asymmetric TSP\", paths may not exist in both directions or the distances might be different, forming a directed graph. Traffic congestion, one-way streets, and airfares for cities with different departure and arrival fees are real-world considerations that could yield a TSP problem in asymmetric form.\nInteger linear programming formulations.\nThe TSP can be formulated as an integer linear program. Several formulations are known. Two notable formulations are the Miller\u2013Tucker\u2013Zemlin (MTZ) formulation and the Dantzig\u2013Fulkerson\u2013Johnson (DFJ) formulation. The DFJ formulation is stronger, though the MTZ formulation is still useful in certain settings.\nCommon to both these formulations is that one labels the cities with the numbers formula_1 and takes formula_2 to be the cost (distance) from city formula_3 to city formula_4. The main variables in the formulations are:\nformula_5\nIt is because these are 0/1 variables that the formulations become integer programs; all other constraints are purely linear. In particular, the objective in the program is to minimize the tour length\n formula_6\nWithout further constraints, the formula_7 will effectively range over all subsets of the set of edges, which is very far from the sets of edges in a tour, and allows for a trivial minimum where all formula_8. Therefore, both formulations also have the constraints that, at each vertex, there is exactly one incoming edge and one outgoing edge, which may be expressed as the formula_9 linear equations\n formula_10 for formula_11 and formula_12 for formula_13\nThese ensure that the chosen set of edges locally looks like that of a tour, but still allow for solutions violating the global requirement that there is \"one\" tour which visits all vertices, as the edges chosen could make up several tours, each visiting only a subset of the vertices; arguably, it is this global requirement that makes TSP a hard problem. The MTZ and DFJ formulations differ in how they express this final requirement as linear constraints.\nMiller\u2013Tucker\u2013Zemlin formulation.\nIn addition to the formula_14 variables as above, there is for each formula_15 a dummy variable formula_16 that keeps track of the order in which the cities are visited, counting from city formula_17; the interpretation is that formula_18 implies city formula_3 is visited before city formula_20 For a given tour (as encoded into values of the formula_14 variables), one may find satisfying values for the formula_22 variables by making formula_22 equal to the number of edges along that tour, when going from city formula_17 to city formula_25\nBecause linear programming favors non-strict inequalities (formula_26) over strict (formula_27), we would like to impose constraints to the effect that\n formula_28 if formula_29\nMerely requiring formula_30 would \"not\" achieve that, because this also requires formula_31 when formula_32 which is not correct. Instead MTZ use the formula_33 linear constraints\n formula_34 for all distinct formula_35\nwhere the constant term formula_36 provides sufficient slack that formula_8 does not impose a relation between formula_38 and formula_39\nThe way that the formula_22 variables then enforce that a single tour visits all cities is that they increase by at least formula_41 for each step along a tour, with a decrease only allowed where the tour passes through city\u00a0formula_42 That constraint would be violated by every tour which does not pass through city\u00a0formula_43 so the only way to satisfy it is that the tour passing city\u00a0formula_41 also passes through all other cities.\nThe MTZ formulation of TSP is thus the following integer linear programming problem:\nformula_45\nThe first set of equalities requires that each city is arrived at from exactly one other city, and the second set of equalities requires that from each city there is a departure to exactly one other city. The last constraint enforces that there is only a single tour covering all cities, and not two or more disjointed tours that only collectively cover all cities.\nDantzig\u2013Fulkerson\u2013Johnson formulation.\nLabel the cities with the numbers 1, ..., \"n\" and define:\nformula_5\nTake formula_2 to be the distance from city \"i\" to city \"j\". Then TSP can be written as the following integer linear programming problem:\nformula_48\nThe last constraint of the DFJ formulation\u2014called a \"subtour elimination\" constraint\u2014ensures that no proper subset Q can form a sub-tour, so the solution returned is a single tour and not the union of smaller tours. Intuitively, for each proper subset Q of the cities, the constraint requires that there be fewer edges than cities in Q: if there were to be as many edges in Q as cities in Q, that would represent a subtour of the cities of Q. Because this leads to an exponential number of possible constraints, in practice it is solved with row generation.\nComputing a solution.\nThe traditional lines of attack for the NP-hard problems are the following:\nExact algorithms.\nThe most direct solution would be to try all permutations (ordered combinations) and see which one is cheapest (using brute-force search). The running time for this approach lies within a polynomial factor of formula_49, the factorial of the number of cities, so this solution becomes impractical even for only 20 cities.\nOne of the earliest applications of dynamic programming is the Held\u2013Karp algorithm, which solves the problem in time formula_50. This bound has also been reached by Exclusion-Inclusion in an attempt preceding the dynamic programming approach.\nImproving these time bounds seems to be difficult. For example, it has not been determined whether a classical exact algorithm for TSP that runs in time formula_51 exists. The currently best quantum exact algorithm for TSP due to Ambainis et al. runs in time formula_52.\nOther approaches include:\nAn exact solution for 15,112 German towns from TSPLIB was found in 2001 using the cutting-plane method proposed by George Dantzig, Ray Fulkerson, and Selmer M. Johnson in 1954, based on linear programming. The computations were performed on a network of 110 processors located at Rice University and Princeton University. The total computation time was equivalent to 22.6\u00a0years on a single 500\u00a0MHz Alpha processor. In May 2004, the travelling salesman problem of visiting all 24,978 towns in Sweden was solved: a tour of length approximately 72,500 kilometres was found, and it was proven that no shorter tour exists. In March 2005, the travelling salesman problem of visiting all 33,810 points in a circuit board was solved using \"Concorde TSP Solver\": a tour of length 66,048,945 units was found, and it was proven that no shorter tour exists. The computation took approximately 15.7 CPU-years (Cook et al. 2006). In April 2006 an instance with 85,900 points was solved using \"Concorde TSP Solver\", taking over 136 CPU-years; see .\nHeuristic and approximation algorithms.\nVarious heuristics and approximation algorithms, which quickly yield good solutions, have been devised. These include the multi-fragment algorithm. Modern methods can find solutions for extremely large problems (millions of cities) within a reasonable time which are, with a high probability, just 2\u20133% away from the optimal solution.\nSeveral categories of heuristics are recognized.\nConstructive heuristics.\nThe nearest neighbour (NN) algorithm (a greedy algorithm) lets the salesman choose the nearest unvisited city as his next move. This algorithm quickly yields an effectively short route. For \"N\" cities randomly distributed on a plane, the algorithm on average yields a path 25% longer than the shortest possible path; however, there exist many specially-arranged city distributions which make the NN algorithm give the worst route. This is true for both asymmetric and symmetric TSPs. Rosenkrantz et al. showed that the NN algorithm has the approximation factor formula_53 for instances satisfying the triangle inequality. A variation of the NN algorithm, called nearest fragment (NF) operator, which connects a group (fragment) of nearest unvisited cities, can find shorter routes with successive iterations. The NF operator can also be applied on an initial solution obtained by the NN algorithm for further improvement in an elitist model, where only better solutions are accepted.\nThe bitonic tour of a set of points is the minimum-perimeter monotone polygon that has the points as its vertices; it can be computed efficiently with dynamic programming.\nAnother constructive heuristic, Match Twice and Stitch (MTS), performs two sequential matchings, where the second matching is executed after deleting all the edges of the first matching, to yield a set of cycles. The cycles are then stitched to produce the final tour.\nThe Algorithm of Christofides and Serdyukov.\nThe algorithm of Christofides and Serdyukov follows a similar outline but combines the minimum spanning tree with a solution of another problem, minimum-weight perfect matching. This gives a TSP tour which is at most 1.5 times the optimal. It was one of the first approximation algorithms, and was in part responsible for drawing attention to approximation algorithms as a practical approach to intractable problems. As a matter of fact, the term \"algorithm\" was not commonly extended to approximation algorithms until later; the Christofides algorithm was initially referred to as the Christofides heuristic.\nThis algorithm looks at things differently by using a result from graph theory which helps improve on the lower bound of the TSP which originated from doubling the cost of the minimum spanning tree. Given an Eulerian graph, we can find an Eulerian tour in &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; time, so if we had an Eulerian graph with cities from a TSP as vertices, then we can easily see that we could use such a method for finding an Eulerian tour to find a TSP solution. By the triangle inequality, we know that the TSP tour can be no longer than the Eulerian tour, and we therefore have a lower bound for the TSP. Such a method is described below.\nTo improve the lower bound, a better way of creating an Eulerian graph is needed. By the triangle inequality, the best Eulerian graph must have the same cost as the best travelling salesman tour; hence, finding optimal Eulerian graphs is at least as hard as TSP. One way of doing this is by minimum weight matching using algorithms with a complexity of formula_54.\nMaking a graph into an Eulerian graph starts with the minimum spanning tree; all the vertices of odd order must then be made even, so a matching for the odd-degree vertices must be added, which increases the order of every odd-degree vertex by 1. This leaves us with a graph where every vertex is of even order, which is thus Eulerian. Adapting the above method gives the algorithm of Christofides and Serdyukov:\nPairwise exchange.\nThe pairwise exchange or 2-opt technique involves iteratively removing two edges and replacing them with two different edges that reconnect the fragments created by edge removal into a new and shorter tour. Similarly, the 3-opt technique removes 3 edges and reconnects them to form a shorter tour. These are special cases of the \"k\"-opt method. The label \"Lin\u2013Kernighan\" is an often heard misnomer for 2-opt; Lin\u2013Kernighan is actually the more general \"k\"-opt method.\nFor Euclidean instances, 2-opt heuristics give on average solutions that are about 5% better than those yielded by Christofides' algorithm. If we start with an initial solution made with a greedy algorithm, then the average number of moves greatly decreases again and is &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;; however, for random starts, the average number of moves is &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. While this is a small increase in size, the initial number of moves for small problems is 10 times as big for a random start compared to one made from a greedy heuristic. This is because such 2-opt heuristics exploit 'bad' parts of a solution such as crossings. These types of heuristics are often used within vehicle routing problem heuristics to re-optimize route solutions.\n\"k\"-opt heuristic, or Lin\u2013Kernighan heuristics.\nThe Lin\u2013Kernighan heuristic is a special case of the \"V\"-opt or variable-opt technique. It involves the following steps:\nThe most popular of the \"k\"-opt methods are 3-opt, as introduced by Shen Lin of Bell Labs in 1965. A special case of 3-opt is where the edges are not disjoint (two of the edges are adjacent to one another). In practice, it is often possible to achieve substantial improvement over 2-opt without the combinatorial cost of the general 3-opt by restricting the 3-changes to this special subset where two of the removed edges are adjacent. This so-called two-and-a-half-opt typically falls roughly midway between 2-opt and 3-opt, both in terms of the quality of tours achieved and the time required to achieve those tours.\n\"V\"-opt heuristic.\nThe variable-opt method is related to, and a generalization of, the \"k\"-opt method. Whereas the \"k\"-opt methods remove a fixed number (\"k\") of edges from the original tour, the variable-opt methods do not fix the size of the edge set to remove. Instead, they grow the set as the search process continues. The best-known method in this family is the Lin\u2013Kernighan method (mentioned above as a misnomer for 2-opt). Shen Lin and Brian Kernighan first published their method in 1972, and it was the most reliable heuristic for solving travelling salesman problems for nearly two decades. More advanced variable-opt methods were developed at Bell Labs in the late 1980s by David Johnson and his research team. These methods (sometimes called Lin\u2013Kernighan\u2013Johnson) build on the Lin\u2013Kernighan method, adding ideas from tabu search and evolutionary computing. The basic Lin\u2013Kernighan technique gives results that are guaranteed to be at least 3-opt. The Lin\u2013Kernighan\u2013Johnson methods compute a Lin\u2013Kernighan tour, and then perturb the tour by what has been described as a mutation that removes at least four edges and reconnects the tour in a different way, then \"V\"-opting the new tour. The mutation is often enough to move the tour from the local minimum identified by Lin\u2013Kernighan. \"V\"-opt methods are widely considered the most powerful heuristics for the problem, and are able to address special cases, such as the Hamilton Cycle Problem and other non-metric TSPs that other heuristics fail on. For many years, Lin\u2013Kernighan\u2013Johnson had identified optimal solutions for all TSPs where an optimal solution was known and had identified the best-known solutions for all other TSPs on which the method had been tried.\nRandomized improvement.\nOptimized Markov chain algorithms which use local searching heuristic sub-algorithms can find a route extremely close to the optimal route for 700 to 800 cities.\nTSP is a touchstone for many general heuristics devised for combinatorial optimization such as genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, tabu search, ant colony optimization, river formation dynamics (see swarm intelligence), and the cross entropy method.\nConstricting Insertion Heuristic.\nThis starts with a sub-tour such as the convex hull and then inserts other vertices.\nAnt colony optimization.\nArtificial intelligence researcher Marco Dorigo described in 1993 a method of heuristically generating \"good solutions\" to the TSP using a simulation of an ant colony called \"ACS\" (\"ant colony system\"). It models behavior observed in real ants to find short paths between food sources and their nest, an emergent behavior resulting from each ant's preference to follow trail pheromones deposited by other ants.\nACS sends out a large number of virtual ant agents to explore many possible routes on the map. Each ant probabilistically chooses the next city to visit based on a heuristic combining the distance to the city and the amount of virtual pheromone deposited on the edge to the city. The ants explore, depositing pheromone on each edge that they cross, until they have all completed a tour. At this point the ant which completed the shortest tour deposits virtual pheromone along its complete tour route (\"global trail updating\"). The amount of pheromone deposited is inversely proportional to the tour length: the shorter the tour, the more it deposits.\nSpecial cases.\nMetric.\nIn the \"metric TSP\", also known as \"delta-TSP\" or \u0394-TSP, the intercity distances satisfy the triangle inequality.\nA very natural restriction of the TSP is to require that the distances between cities form a metric to satisfy the triangle inequality; that is, the direct connection from \"A\" to \"B\" is never farther than the route via intermediate \"C\":\nformula_55.\nThe edges then build a metric on the set of vertices. When the cities are viewed as points in the plane, many natural distance functions are metrics, and so many natural instances of TSP satisfy this constraint.\nThe following are some examples of metric TSPs for various metrics.\nThe last two metrics appear, for example, in routing a machine that drills a given set of holes in a printed circuit board. The Manhattan metric corresponds to a machine that adjusts first one coordinate, and then the other, so the time to move to a new point is the sum of both movements. The maximum metric corresponds to a machine that adjusts both coordinates simultaneously, so the time to move to a new point is the slower of the two movements.\nIn its definition, the TSP does not allow cities to be visited twice, but many applications do not need this constraint. In such cases, a symmetric, non-metric instance can be reduced to a metric one. This replaces the original graph with a complete graph in which the inter-city distance formula_56 is replaced by the shortest path length between \"A\" and \"B\" in the original graph.\nEuclidean.\nFor points in the Euclidean plane, the optimal solution to the travelling salesman problem forms a simple polygon through all of the points, a polygonalization of the points. Any non-optimal solution with crossings can be made into a shorter solution without crossings by local optimizations. The Euclidean distance obeys the triangle inequality, so the Euclidean TSP forms a special case of metric TSP. However, even when the input points have integer coordinates, their distances generally take the form of square roots, and the length of a tour is a sum of radicals, making it difficult to perform the symbolic computation needed to perform exact comparisons of the lengths of different tours.\nLike the general TSP, the exact Euclidean TSP is NP-hard, but the issue with sums of radicals is an obstacle to proving that its decision version is in NP, and therefore NP-complete. A discretized version of the problem with distances rounded to integers is NP-complete. With rational coordinates and the actual Euclidean metric, Euclidean TSP is known to be in the Counting Hierarchy, a subclass of PSPACE. With arbitrary real coordinates, Euclidean TSP cannot be in such classes, since there are uncountably many possible inputs. Despite these complications, Euclidean TSP is much easier than the general metric case for approximation. For example, the minimum spanning tree of the graph associated with an instance of the Euclidean TSP is a Euclidean minimum spanning tree, and so can be computed in expected \"O\"(\"n\" log \"n\") time for \"n\" points (considerably less than the number of edges). This enables the simple 2-approximation algorithm for TSP with triangle inequality above to operate more quickly.\nIn general, for any \"c\" &gt; 0, where \"d\" is the number of dimensions in the Euclidean space, there is a polynomial-time algorithm that finds a tour of length at most (1 + 1/\"c\") times the optimal for geometric instances of TSP in\nformula_57\ntime; this is called a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS). Sanjeev Arora and Joseph S. B. Mitchell were awarded the G\u00f6del Prize in 2010 for their concurrent discovery of a PTAS for the Euclidean TSP.\nIn practice, simpler heuristics with weaker guarantees continue to be used.\nAsymmetric.\nIn most cases, the distance between two nodes in the TSP network is the same in both directions. The case where the distance from \"A\" to \"B\" is not equal to the distance from \"B\" to \"A\" is called asymmetric TSP. A practical application of an asymmetric TSP is route optimization using street-level routing (which is made asymmetric by one-way streets, slip-roads, motorways, etc.).\nThe stacker crane problem can be viewed as a special case of the asymmetric TSP. In this problem, the input consists of ordered pairs of points in a metric space, which must be visited consecutively in order by the tour. These pairs of points can be viewed as the nodes of an asymmetric TSP, with asymmetric distances reflecting the combined cost of traveling from the first point of a pair to its second and then from the second point of a pair to the first point of the next pair.\nConversion to symmetric.\nSolving an asymmetric TSP graph can be somewhat complex. The following is a 3\u00d73 matrix containing all possible path weights between the nodes \"A\", \"B\" and \"C\". One option is to turn an asymmetric matrix of size \"N\" into a symmetric matrix of size 2\"N\".\nTo double the size, each of the nodes in the graph is duplicated, creating a second \"ghost node\", linked to the original node with a \"ghost\" edge of very low (possibly negative) weight, here denoted \u2212\"w\". (Alternatively, the ghost edges have weight 0, and weight w is added to all other edges.) The original 3\u00d73 matrix shown above is visible in the bottom left and the transpose of the original in the top-right. Both copies of the matrix have had their diagonals replaced by the low-cost hop paths, represented by \u2212\"w\". In the new graph, no edge directly links original nodes and no edge directly links ghost nodes.\nThe weight \u2212\"w\" of the \"ghost\" edges linking the ghost nodes to the corresponding original nodes must be low enough to ensure that all ghost edges must belong to any optimal symmetric TSP solution on the new graph (\"w\" = 0 is not always low enough). As a consequence, in the optimal symmetric tour, each original node appears next to its ghost node (e.g. a possible path is A \u2192 A\u2032 \u2192 C \u2192 C\u2032 \u2192 B \u2192 B\u2032 \u2192 A), and by merging the original and ghost nodes again we get an (optimal) solution of the original asymmetric problem (in our example, A \u2192 C \u2192 B \u2192 A).\nAnalyst's problem.\nThere is an analogous problem in geometric measure theory which asks the following: under what conditions may a subset \"E\" of Euclidean space be contained in a rectifiable curve (that is, when is there a curve with finite length that visits every point in \"E\")? This problem is known as the analyst's travelling salesman problem.\nPath length for random sets of points in a square.\nSuppose formula_58 are formula_59 independent random variables with uniform distribution in the square formula_60, and let formula_61 be the shortest path length (i.e. TSP solution) for this set of points, according to the usual Euclidean distance. It is known that, almost surely,\nformula_62\nwhere formula_63 is a positive constant that is not known explicitly. Since formula_64 (see below), it follows from bounded convergence theorem that formula_65, hence lower and upper bounds on formula_63 follow from bounds on formula_67.\nThe almost-sure limit formula_68 as formula_69 may not exist if the independent locations formula_58 are replaced with observations from a stationary ergodic process with uniform marginals.\nformula_83\nformula_88\nformula_89\nformula_92\nLower bound.\nwhere 0.522 comes from the points near the square boundary which have fewer neighbours, and Christine L. Valenzuela and Antonia J. Jones obtained the following other numerical lower bound:\nformula_93.\nComputational complexity.\nThe problem has been shown to be NP-hard (more precisely, it is complete for the complexity class FPNP; see function problem), and the decision problem version (\"given the costs and a number \"x\", decide whether there is a round-trip route cheaper than \"x\"\") is NP-complete. The bottleneck travelling salesman problem is also NP-hard. The problem remains NP-hard even for the case when the cities are in the plane with Euclidean distances, as well as in a number of other restrictive cases. Removing the condition of visiting each city \"only once\" does not remove the NP-hardness, since in the planar case there is an optimal tour that visits each city only once (otherwise, by the triangle inequality, a shortcut that skips a repeated visit would not increase the tour length).\nComplexity of approximation.\nIn the general case, finding a shortest travelling salesman tour is NPO-complete. If the distance measure is a metric (and thus symmetric), the problem becomes APX-complete, and the algorithm of Christofides and Serdyukov approximates it within 1.5.\nIf the distances are restricted to 1 and 2 (but still are a metric), then the approximation ratio becomes 8/7. In the asymmetric case with triangle inequality, in 2018, a constant factor approximation was developed by Svensson, Tarnawski, and V\u00e9gh. An algorithm by Vera Traub and Jens Vygen achieves a performance ratio of formula_94. The best known inapproximability bound is 75/74.\nThe corresponding maximization problem of finding the \"longest\" travelling salesman tour is approximable within 63/38. If the distance function is symmetric, then the longest tour can be approximated within 4/3 by a deterministic algorithm and within formula_95 by a randomized algorithm.\nHuman and animal performance.\nThe TSP, in particular the Euclidean variant of the problem, has attracted the attention of researchers in cognitive psychology. It has been observed that humans are able to produce near-optimal solutions quickly, in a close-to-linear fashion, with performance that ranges from 1% less efficient, for graphs with 10\u201320 nodes, to 11% less efficient for graphs with 120 nodes. The apparent ease with which humans accurately generate near-optimal solutions to the problem has led researchers to hypothesize that humans use one or more heuristics, with the two most popular theories arguably being the convex-hull hypothesis and the crossing-avoidance heuristic. However, additional evidence suggests that human performance is quite varied, and individual differences as well as graph geometry appear to affect performance in the task. Nevertheless, results suggest that computer performance on the TSP may be improved by understanding and emulating the methods used by humans for these problems, and have also led to new insights into the mechanisms of human thought. The first issue of the \"Journal of Problem Solving\" was devoted to the topic of human performance on TSP, and a 2011 review listed dozens of papers on the subject.\nA 2011 study in animal cognition titled \"Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus,\" named after the children's book \"Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus!\", examined spatial cognition in pigeons by studying their flight patterns between multiple feeders in a laboratory in relation to the travelling salesman problem. In the first experiment, pigeons were placed in the corner of a lab room and allowed to fly to nearby feeders containing peas. The researchers found that pigeons largely used proximity to determine which feeder they would select next. In the second experiment, the feeders were arranged in such a way that flying to the nearest feeder at every opportunity would be largely inefficient if the pigeons needed to visit every feeder. The results of the second experiment indicate that pigeons, while still favoring proximity-based solutions, \"can plan several steps ahead along the route when the differences in travel costs between efficient and less efficient routes based on proximity become larger.\" These results are consistent with other experiments done with non-primates, which have proven that some non-primates were able to plan complex travel routes. This suggests non-primates may possess a relatively sophisticated spatial cognitive ability.\nNatural computation.\nHumans are not the only species to show excellent efficiency. For example, when presented with a spatial configuration of food sources, the amoeboid \"Physarum polycephalum\" adapts its morphology to create an efficient path between the food sources, which can also be viewed as an approximate solution to TSP. Similarly, honey bees and bumblebees have been shown to be very adept at maximising efficiency to a very high degree of accuracy when collecting nectar and pollen by using collective intelligence.\nBenchmarks.\nFor benchmarking of TSP algorithms, TSPLIB is a library of sample instances of the TSP and related problems is maintained; see the TSPLIB external reference.

This 1G technology is now obsolete.\nHistory.\nVodafone (known then as Racal-Vodafone) opted for a \u00a330 million turnkey contract from Ericsson (ERA) to design, build and set up its initial network of 100 base station sites.\nCellnet (then known Telecom Securicor Cellular Radio Ltd) used development labs in the facilities at General Electric (later made part of Motorola) based at Lynchburg, Virginia, United States. The reason Cellnet used the General Electric labs was because the AMPS system was already in development there, and the company had set up a production facility in readiness for AMPS production in 1985 which the Cellnet TACS was to share. In March 1984 development of prototypes began at General Electric. Production began in 1985 and General Electric produced 20,000 systems that year for Cellnet's distribution in the UK. Production of what was to become the Motorola model were then made at Stotfold, Bedfordshire, England. This production facility continued making TACS until the advent of GSM.\nTACS cellular phones were used in Europe (including the UK, Italy, Austria and Ireland) and other countries. TACS was also used in Japan under the name Japanese Total Access Communication (JTAC). It was also used in Hong Kong. ETACS was an extended version of TACS with more channels.\nTACS and ETACS are now obsolete in Europe, having been replaced by the GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) system. In the United Kingdom, the last ETACS service operated by Vodafone was discontinued on 31 May 2001, after 16 years of service. The competing service in the UK operated by Cellnet (latterly BT Cellnet) was closed on Sunday 1 October 2000.\nEircell (now Vodafone Ireland) closed its TACS network on 26 January 2001. This followed a long period during which customers were encouraged to switch to GSM services. When the network was closed, there were very few, if any, active TACS customers left. Customers who switched network were able to keep their phone number, but the (088) prefix was changed to either 087 (Eircell, now Vodafone Ireland) GSM or 086 (Esat Digifone, which became O2 Ireland before merging with Three) GSM. At the time, full mobile number portability was not available to TACS customers and the (088) prefix was closed.

It allows several users to share the same frequency channel by dividing the signal into different time slots. The users transmit in rapid succession, one after the other, each using its own time slot. This allows multiple stations to share the same transmission medium (e.g. radio frequency channel) while using only a part of its channel capacity. Dynamic TDMA is a TDMA variant that dynamically reserves a variable number of time slots in each frame to variable bit-rate data streams, based on the traffic demand of each data stream.\nTDMA is used in digital 2G cellular systems such as Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), IS-136, Personal Digital Cellular (PDC) and iDEN, in the Maritime Automatic Identification System, and in the Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT) standard for portable phones. TDMA was first used in satellite communication systems by Western Union in its Westar 3 communications satellite in 1979. It is now used extensively in satellite communications, combat-net radio systems, and passive optical network (PON) networks for upstream traffic from premises to the operator.\nTDMA is a type of time-division multiplexing (TDM), with the special point that instead of having one transmitter connected to one receiver, there are multiple transmitters. In the case of the \"uplink\" from a mobile phone to a base station this becomes particularly difficult because the mobile phone can move around and vary the \"timing advance\" required to make its transmission match the gap in transmission from its peers.\nIn mobile phone systems.\n2G systems.\nMost 2G cellular systems, with the notable exception of IS-95, are based on TDMA. GSM, D-AMPS, PDC, iDEN, and PHS are examples of TDMA cellular systems.\nIn the GSM system, the synchronization of the mobile phones is achieved by sending timing advance commands from the base station which instruct the mobile phone to transmit earlier and by how much. This compensates for the speed-of-light propagation delay. The mobile phone is not allowed to transmit for its entire time slot; there is a guard interval at the end of each time slot. As the transmission moves into the guard period, the mobile network adjusts the timing advance to synchronize the transmission.\nInitial synchronization of a phone requires even more care. Before a mobile transmits there is no way to know the offset required. For this reason, an entire time slot has to be dedicated to mobiles attempting to contact the network; this is known as the random-access channel (RACH) in GSM. The mobile transmits at the beginning of the time slot as received from the network. If the mobile is near the base station, the propagation delay is short and the initiation can succeed. If, however, the mobile phone is just less than 35\u00a0km from the base station, the delay will mean the mobile's transmission arrives at the end of the time slot. In this case, the mobile will be instructed to transmit its messages starting nearly a whole time slot earlier so that it can be received at the proper time. Finally, if the mobile is beyond the 35\u00a0km cell range of GSM, the transmission will arrive in a neighbouring time slot and be ignored. It is this feature, rather than limitations of power, that limits the range of a GSM cell to 35\u00a0km when no special extension techniques are used. By changing the synchronization between the uplink and downlink at the base station, however, this limitation can be overcome.\n3G systems.\nIn the context of 3G systems, the integration of time-division multiple access (TDMA) with code-division multiple access (CDMA) and time-division duplexing (TDD) in the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) represents a sophisticated approach to optimizing spectrum efficiency and network performance.\nUTRA-FDD (frequency division duplex) employs CDMA and FDD, where separate frequency bands are allocated for uplink and downlink transmissions. This separation minimizes interference and allows for continuous data transmission in both directions, making it suitable for environments with balanced traffic loads.\nUTRA-TDD (time division duplex), on the other hand, combines CDMA with TDMA and TDD. In this scheme, the same frequency band is used for both uplink and downlink, but at different times. This time-based separation is particularly advantageous in scenarios with asymmetric traffic loads, where the data rates for uplink and downlink differ significantly. By dynamically allocating time slots based on demand, UTRA-TDD can efficiently manage varying traffic patterns and enhance overall network capacity.\nThe combination of these technologies in UMTS allows for more flexible and efficient use of the available spectrum, catering to diverse user demands and improving the adaptability of 3G networks to different operational environments.\nIn wired networks.\nThe ITU-T G.hn standard, which provides high-speed local area networking over existing home wiring (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables) is based on a TDMA scheme. In G.hn, a \"master\" device allocates \"contention-free transmission opportunities\" (CFTXOP) to other \"slave\" devices in the network. Only one device can use a CFTXOP at a time, thus avoiding collisions. FlexRay protocol which is also a wired network used for safety-critical communication in modern cars, uses the TDMA method for data transmission control.\nComparison with other multiple-access schemes.\nIn radio systems, TDMA is usually used alongside frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) and frequency-division duplex (FDD); the combination is referred to as FDMA/TDMA/FDD. This is the case in both GSM and IS-136 for example. Exceptions to this include the DECT and Personal Handy-phone System (PHS) micro-cellular systems, UMTS-TDD UMTS variant, and China's TD-SCDMA, which use time-division duplexing, where different time slots are allocated for the base station and handsets on the same frequency.\nA major advantage of TDMA is that the radio part of the mobile-only needs to listen and broadcast for its own time slot. For the rest of the time, the mobile can carry out measurements on the network, detecting surrounding transmitters on different frequencies. This allows safe inter-frequency handovers, something which is difficult in CDMA systems, not supported at all in IS-95 and supported through complex system additions in Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). This in turn allows for co-existence of microcell layers with macrocell layers.\nCDMA, by comparison, supports \"soft hand-off\" which allows a mobile phone to be in communication with up to 6 base stations simultaneously, a type of \"same-frequency handover\". The incoming packets are compared for quality, and the best one is selected. CDMA's \"cell breathing\" characteristic, where a terminal on the boundary of two congested cells will be unable to receive a clear signal, can often negate this advantage during peak periods.\nA disadvantage of TDMA systems is that they create interference at a frequency that is directly connected to the time slot length. This is the buzz that can sometimes be heard if a TDMA phone is left next to a radio or speakers. Another disadvantage is that the \"dead time\" between time slots limits the potential bandwidth of a TDMA channel. These are implemented in part because of the difficulty in ensuring that different terminals transmit at exactly the times required. Handsets that are moving will need to constantly adjust their timings to ensure their transmission is received at precisely the right time because as they move further from the base station, their signal will take longer to arrive. This also means that the major TDMA systems have hard limits on cell sizes in terms of range, though in practice the power levels required to receive and transmit over distances greater than the supported range would be mostly impractical anyway.\nAdvantages of TDMA.\nTDMA (time-division multiple access) is a communication method that allocates radio frequency (RF) bandwidth into discrete time slots, allowing multiple users to share the channel in a sequential manner. This approach not only improves spectrum efficiency compared to analog systems but also offers several specific advantages that enhance communication quality and system performance.\nDynamic TDMA.\nIn dynamic time-division multiple access (dynamic TDMA), a scheduling algorithm dynamically reserves a variable number of time slots in each frame to variable bit-rate data streams, based on the traffic demand of each data stream. Dynamic TDMA is used in:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The allegorical plotlines of the series contain elements of science fiction, psychological drama, and spy fiction. It was produced by Everyman Films for distribution by Lew Grade's ITC Entertainment.\nA single series of 17 episodes was filmed between September 1966 and January 1968, with exterior location filming primarily taking place in the Welsh seaside village of Portmeirion. Interiors were filmed at MGM-British Studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. The series was first broadcast in Canada beginning on 5 September 1967, in the UK on 29 September 1967, and in the United States on 1 June 1968. \nAlthough the show was sold as a thriller in the mould of \"Danger Man\", McGoohan's previous series, its surreal and Kafkaesque setting and reflection of concerns of the 1960s counterculture have had a far-reaching influence on popular culture and the series ultimately developed a cult following.\nPremise.\nThe series follows Number Six (Patrick McGoohan), an unnamed British intelligence agent who, after abruptly and angrily resigning from his highly sensitive government job, prepares to go on a trip. While packing his luggage, he is rendered unconscious by knockout gas piped into his home in Westminster.\nUpon waking, he finds himself in a recreation of the interior of his home, located in a mysterious coastal settlement known to its residents as \"the Village\". The Village is surrounded by mountains on three sides and the sea on the other.\nIn subsequent episodes, Number Six becomes acquainted with the residents, hundreds of people from all walks of life and cultures, all seeming to be peacefully and mostly enjoyably living out their lives. They do not use names, but have been assigned numbers, which, aside from designations such as Two, Three, and Six, give no clue as to their status within the Village. Most are captives, but some are guards. Prisoners, therefore, have no idea whom they can and cannot trust. The protagonist is assigned Number Six but refuses to accept the designation: \"I am not a number! I am a free man!\"\nAlthough the residents can freely move about the Village, they are constantly under the surveillance of numerous high-tech monitoring systems and cannot leave. Security forces, including a balloon-shaped automaton called Rover, recapture or kill those who attempt to escape.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI will not make any deals with you. I've resigned. I will not be pushed, filed, stamped, indexed, briefed, debriefed, or numbered! My life is my own.\n Number Six in the first episode, \"Arrival\"\nNumber Six is a particularly important target of the constantly changing Number Two, the Village administrator, who acts as an agent for the unseen Number One. Number Two uses techniques such as hallucinogenic drugs, identity theft, mind control, dream manipulation and forms of social indoctrination and physical coercion in an attempt to make Number Six reveal why he resigned from his position. The position of Number Two is assigned to a different person in each episode, with two making repeat appearances. This is assumed to be part of a larger plan to disorient Number Six, but sometimes the change of personnel seems to be the result of the failure of the previous incumbent, whose fate is unknown.\nNumber Six, distrustful of everyone in the Village, refuses to co-operate or provide the answers they seek. He struggles, usually alone, with various goals, such as determining for which side of the Iron Curtain the Village functions, if either, remaining defiant to its imposed authority, concocting plans for escape, learning all he can about the Village, and subverting its operation. His schemes lead to the dismissals of the incumbent Number Two on several occasions. Despite foiling the system, however, Number Six never escapes. By the end of the series, the administration, becoming desperate for Number Six's knowledge, as well as fearful of his growing influence in the Village, takes drastic measures that threaten the lives of Number Six, Number Two, and the entire Village.\nA major theme of the series is the conflict between individualism, as represented by Number Six, and collectivism, as represented by the Village. According to McGoohan, the series aimed to demonstrate a balance between the two ideologies.\nCast.\nNumber Two.\nThe episodes featured guest stars in the role of Number Two.\nGuest cast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMcGoohan was the only actor credited during the opening sequence, with Muscat the only actor considered a co-star of the series. Several actors (including Alexis Kanner, Christopher Benjamin and Georgina Cookson) appeared in more than one episode playing different characters. Frank Maher, McGoohan's stunt double, who is seen running across the beach in the title sequence, also appears extensively in \"The Schizoid Man\" and in \"Living in Harmony\".\nEpisodes.\n\"The Prisoner\" consists of 17 episodes, which were first broadcast from 29 September 1967 to 1 February 1968 in the United Kingdom. While the show was presented as a serialised work, with a clear beginning and end, the ordering of the intermediate episodes is unclear, as the production and original broadcast order were different. Several attempts have been made to create an episode ordering based on script and production notes and interpretations of the broader narrative of Number Six's time in the Village.\nOpening and closing sequences.\nThe opening and closing sequences of \"The Prisoner\" have become iconic, cited as \"one of the great set-ups of genre drama\", by establishing the Orwellian and postmodern themes of the series. The high production values of the opening sequence have been described as more like those of a feature film than a television programme.\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\n\"The Prisoner\" was created while Patrick McGoohan and George Markstein were working on \"Danger Man\", an espionage show produced by Incorporated Television Company. The exact details of who created which aspects of the show are disputed, as there is no \"created by\" credit. Majority opinion credits McGoohan as the sole creator of the series, but a disputed co-creator status was later ascribed to Markstein after a series of fan interviews were published in the 1980s.\nSome sources indicate that McGoohan was the sole or primary creator of the show. McGoohan stated in a 1977 interview that, during the filming of the third series of \"Danger Man\", he told ITC Entertainment managing director Lew Grade that he wanted to quit working on \"Danger Man\" after the filming of the proposed fourth series. Grade was unhappy with the decision, but when McGoohan insisted upon quitting, Grade asked if McGoohan had any other possible projects, and McGoohan later pitched \"The Prisoner\". In a 1988 article in British telefantasy magazine \"Time Screen\", though, McGoohan indicated that he had planned to pitch \"The Prisoner\" before speaking with Grade. In both accounts, McGoohan pitched the idea orally, rather than having Grade read the proposal in detail, and the two made an oral agreement for the show to be produced by Everyman Films, the production company formed by McGoohan and David Tomblin. In the 1977 account, McGoohan said that Grade approved of the show despite not understanding it, whereas, in the 1988 account, Grade expressed clear support for the concept.\nOther sources, however, credit Markstein, then a script editor for \"Danger Man\", with a significant or even primary portion of the development of the show. For example, Dave Rogers, in the book \"The Prisoner and Danger Man\", said that Markstein claimed to have created the concept first and McGoohan later attempted to take credit for it, although Rogers himself doubted that McGoohan would have wanted or needed to do that. A four-page document, generally agreed to have been written by Markstein, setting out an overview of the themes of the series, was published as part of an ITC/ATV press book in 1967. It has usually been accepted that this text originated earlier as a guide for the series writers. Further doubt has been cast on Markstein's version of events by author Rupert Booth in his biography of McGoohan, entitled \"Not a Number\". Booth points out that McGoohan had outlined the themes of \"The Prisoner\" in a 1965 interview, long before Markstein's tenure as script editor on the brief fourth series of \"Danger Man\".\nPart of Markstein's inspiration came from his research into the Second World War, where he found that some people had been incarcerated in a resort-like prison in Scotland called Inverlair Lodge, near Inverness. Markstein suggested that \"Danger Man\"'s main character John Drake (played by McGoohan) could suddenly resign and be kidnapped and sent to such a location. McGoohan added Markstein's suggestion to material he had been working on, which later became \"The Prisoner\". Furthermore, a 1960 episode of \"Danger Man\" entitled \"View from the Villa\" had exteriors filmed in Portmeirion, a Welsh resort village that struck McGoohan as a good location for future projects.\nAccording to \"Fantasy or Reality\" \u2014 a chapter of \"The Prisoner of Portmeirion\" \u2014 the Village is based, in part, on \"a strange place in Scotland\" operated by the Inter-Services Research Bureau, wherein \"people\" with \"valuable knowledge of one sort or another\" were held prisoners on extended \"holidays\" in a \"luxury prison camp\". \"The Prisoner\"'s story editor, George Markstein, this source contends, knows of \"the existence of this 'secure establishment'\". However, this \"Scottish prison camp, in reality, was not, of course, a holiday-type village full of people wearing colourful clothing.\"\nFurther inspiration came from a \"Danger Man\" episode called \"Colony Three\", in which Drake infiltrates a spy school in Eastern Europe during the Cold War. The school, in the middle of nowhere, is set up to look like a normal English town in which pupils and instructors mix as in any other normal city, but the instructors are virtual prisoners with little hope of ever leaving. McGoohan also stated that he was influenced by his experience from theatre, including his work in the Orson Welles play \"Moby Dick\u2014Rehearsed\" (1955) and in a BBC television play, \"The Prisoner\" by Bridget Boland. McGoohan wrote a forty-page show Bible, which included a \"history of the Village, the sort of telephones they used, the sewerage system, what they ate, the transport, the boundaries, a description of the Village, every aspect of it.\" McGoohan wrote and directed several episodes, often using pseudonyms. Specifically, McGoohan wrote \"Free for All\" under the pen name Paddy Fitz (Paddy being the Irish diminutive for Patrick and Fitzpatrick being his mother's maiden name) and directed the episodes \"Many Happy Returns\" and \"A Change of Mind\" using the stage name Joseph Serf, the surname being ironically a word meaning a peasant who is under the control of a feudal master. Using his own name, McGoohan wrote and directed the last two episodes\u2014\"Once Upon a Time\" and \"Fall Out\"\u2014and directed \"Free for All\".\nIn a 1966 interview for the \"Los Angeles Times\" by reporter Robert Musel, McGoohan stated, \"John Drake of \"Secret Agent\" is gone.\" Furthermore, McGoohan stated in a 1985 interview that Number Six is not the same character as John Drake, adding that he had originally wanted another actor to portray the character. However, other sources indicate that several of the crew members who continued on from \"Danger Man\" to work on \"The Prisoner\" considered it to be a continuation, and that McGoohan was continuing to play the character of John Drake. Author Dave Rogers claims that Markstein had wanted the character to be a continuation of Drake, but doing so would have meant paying royalties to Ralph Smart, the creator of \"Danger Man\". The second licensed novel based on \"The Prisoner\", published in 1969, refers to Number Six as \"Drake\" from its first sentence: \"Drake woke.\" The issue has been extensively debated by fans and television critics.\nMcGoohan had originally wanted to produce only seven episodes of \"The Prisoner\", but Grade argued that more shows were necessary in order for him to sell the series to CBS. The exact number that was agreed to and how the series was to end are disputed by different sources.\nIn an August 1967 article, Dorothy Manners reported that CBS had asked McGoohan to produce 36 segments, but he would agree to produce only 17. According to a 1977 interview, Lew Grade requested 26 episodes, but McGoohan thought this would spread the show too thin, managing to come up with only 17. According to \"The Prisoner: The Official Companion to the Classic TV Series\", the series was originally supposed to run longer, but was cancelled, forcing McGoohan to write the final episode in only a few days.\n\"The Prisoner\" had its British premiere on 29 September 1967 on ATV Midlands, and the last episode first aired on 1 February 1968 on Scottish Television. The world broadcast premiere was on the CTV Television Network in Canada on 5 September 1967.\nFilming.\nFilming began with the shooting of the series' opening sequence in London on 28 August 1966, with location work beginning on 5 September 1966, primarily in Portmeirion, North Wales. This location partially inspired the show. At the request of Portmeirion's architect Clough Williams-Ellis, the main location for the series was not disclosed until the opening credits of the final episode, where it was described as \"The Hotel Portmeirion, Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales\". Many local residents were recruited as extras. The Village setting was further augmented by the use of the backlot facilities at MGM-British Studios in Borehamwood.\nAdditionally, filming of a key sequence of the opening credits\u2014and of exterior location filming for three episodes\u2014took place at 1 Buckingham Place in Westminster, which at the time was a private residence, presented as Number Six's home. The building is now a highlight of \"Prisoner\" location tours, and currently houses the headquarters of the Royal Warrant Holders Association. The episodes \"Many Happy Returns\", \"The Girl Who Was Death\" (the cricket match for which was filmed at four locations, with the main sequences filmed at Eltisley in Cambridgeshire) and \"Fall Out\" also made use of extensive location shooting in London and other locations.\nAt the time, most British television was broadcast in black and white, but the show was filmed in colour to reach the American audience.\nBackground of the Village.\nPatrick McGoohan created a detailed guide for the writers of the series, detailing what the series was about, and how the village would work, the practical matters around use of phones and the numbers instead of names.\nAccording to the writer James Follett, a friend and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of George Markstein, Markstein had developed a backstory explaining the origin of the Village and its connection to Number Six's resignation.\nMarkstein's concept was that John Drake (of \"Danger Man\") had once proposed a strategy for dealing with retired secret agents who could still pose a security risk. Years later, Drake discovers that his proposal was put into practice, not as a benign means of retirement, but an interrogation centre and prison camp known as The Village.\nOutraged, Drake resigns, knowing he will be taken to The Village, where he planned to learn everything he can about how his idea has been implemented and find a way to destroy it. However, due to the range of nationalities and agents present, Drake realises that he can't be sure whose Village he is in\u2014his own, or one belonging to the other side.\nMarkstein later commented:The prisoner was going to leave the Village and he was going to have adventures in many parts of the world, but ultimately he would always be a prisoner. By that I don't mean he would always go back to the Village. He would always be a prisoner of his circumstances, his situation, his secret, his background... and 'they' would always be there to ensure that his captivity continues.\nReception.\nThe finale of \"The Prisoner\" left numerous open-ended questions, generating controversy and letters of outrage. Following the final episode, McGoohan \"claimed he had to go into hiding for a while\".\nHome media.\nVideo tapes.\nNumerous editions of \"The Prisoner\" were released in the UK by companies such as Carlton, the copyright holder of the TV series. The first VHS and Betamax releases were through Precision Video in 1982 from 16mm original prints. They released four tapes, each with two episodes edited together: \"The Arrival\"/\"The Schizoid Man\", \"Many Happy Returns\"/\"A. B. and C.\", \"Checkmate\"/\"Free For All\", and \"The General\"/\"The Chimes of Big Ben\", thus omitting the final storyline. In 1986 Channel 5 Video (a now-defunct home video brand owned by Universal Pictures) released a series of all 17 episodes on VHS and LaserDisc. In 1993 PolyGram Video released the entire series plus a special feature called \"The Best of The Prisoner\" on five VHS cassette tapes.\nIn North America, MPI Home Video released a total of 20 VHS videotapes in 1984 encompassing the entire series: one tape for each of the 17 episodes plus three more containing \"The Alternate Version of 'The Chimes of Big Ben'\", a documentary, and a \"best of\" retrospective. MPI also released editions of nine LaserDiscs in 1988 and 1998, the last disc of which comprised the final Episode 17, \"Fall Out\", plus \"The Prisoner Video Companion\" on side two.\nDVD.\nIn 2000, the first DVD release in the UK was issued by Carlton International Entertainment, with A&amp;E Home Video releasing the same DVDs in North America/Region 1 (in four-episode sets as well as a comprehensive 10-disc \"mega-box\" edition). A&amp;E subsequently reissued the mega-box in a 40th anniversary edition in 2007. The A&amp;E issue included an alternative version of \"The Chimes of Big Ben\" and the MPI-produced documentary (but not the redundant \"best of\" retrospective) among its limited special features. In Australia, Umbrella Entertainment released a DVD set in 2003. In 2005 DeAgostini in the UK released all 17 episodes in a fortnightly partwork series.\n\"The Prisoner: 40th Anniversary Special Edition\" DVD box-set released in 2007 featured standard-definition versions from high-definition masters created by Network. It also included a production guide to the series by Andrew Pixley.\nBlu-ray.\n\"The Prisoner: The Complete Series\" was released on Blu-ray Disc in the United Kingdom on 28 September 2009, following in North America on 27 October 2009. The episodes were restored by the A&amp;E Network to create new high-definition masters. The box-set features all 17 remastered episodes plus extensive special features, including the feature-length documentary \"Don't Knock Yourself Out\", a restored original edit of \"Arrival\" and extensive archive photos and production stills.\n\"The Prisoner: 50th Anniversary Set\" was released in the United Kingdom on 29 July 2019. It featured a six-disc Blu-ray collection with none of the extra material found on the DVD box-set released for the 40th anniversary included. The first half of Andrew Pixley's production book was now illustrated and presented in hardback, and text commentaries for every episode detailing the production story of the series were included for the first time. A six-CD set of remastered music was also included. Some additional extras were included such as an interview with McGoohan's daughter, Catherine. Missing from the set was the \"Don't Knock Yourself Out\" documentary, the script PDFs and some episode commentaries.\nSpin-offs.\nBooks.\nIn the late 1960s, the TV series quickly spawned three novels tied into the series. In the 1970s and into the 1980s, as the series gained cult status, a large amount of fan-produced material began to appear, with the official appreciation society forming in 1977. In 1988, the first officially sanctioned guide\u2014\"The Prisoner Companion\"\u2014was released. It was not well received by fans or Patrick McGoohan. In 1989, Oswald and Carraze released \"The Prisoner\" in France with a translated version appearing shortly after. From the 1990s, numerous other books about the TV series and Patrick McGoohan have been produced. Robert Fairclough's books\u2014including two volumes of original scripts\u2014are considered some of the best researched books available. For the 40th anniversary, Andrew Pixley wrote a well-received and in depth account of the series' production. There are guides to shooting locations in Portmeirion and also a biography of co-creator George Markstein. Some members of the production crew have released books about their time working on the series including Eric Mival and Ian Rakoff.\nGames.\nIn the early 1980s, Edu-Ware produced two computer games based upon the series for the Apple II computer. The first, titled simply \"The Prisoner\", was released in 1980, followed by \"Prisoner 2\" in 1982.\nSteve Jackson Games' popular role-playing game system \"GURPS\" released a (now out of print) world book for \"The Prisoner\". It included maps, episode synopses and details of the Village and its inhabitants.\nComics.\nIn 1988, DC Comics released , the first part of a four-part series of comics based on the characters in the TV series. In 2018 Titan Comics re-issued \"Shattered Visage\" as well as releasing \"The Prisoner: The Uncertainty Machine\", another four-part series of comics about another spy returning to the Village. Although Patrick McGoohan's Number Six is depicted on covers of the 2018 series, the character plays no direct role in the story.\nRemake.\nIn 2009, the show was remade as a miniseries, also titled \"The Prisoner\", which aired in the U.S. on AMC. The miniseries stars Jim Caviezel as Number 6, and Ian McKellen as Number 2, and was shot on location in Namibia and South Africa. The new series received mainly unfavourable reviews, with a 45/100 rating by 21 critics and 3.6/10 by 82 users as of July 2018.\nProposed film adaptations.\nSimon West was attached to a film adaptation of the series in 2001, which failed to materialise. Christopher Nolan was reported to be considering a film version in 2009 but later dropped out of the project. The producer Barry Mendel said a decision to continue with the project depended on the success of the television mini-series.\nIn 2016, Ridley Scott was in talks to direct a film adaptation. Nolan was once again tied to a potential film in 2024.\nAudio dramas.\nOn 5 January 2015, Big Finish Productions, best known for its long-running series of BBC-licensed audio dramas based upon \"Doctor Who\", announced that it would be producing licensed audio dramas based on \"The Prisoner\", with the first scheduled for release in 2016, and that Mark Elstob would play Number Six. The first series, containing new reimaginings of three original series scripts, \"Arrival\", \"The Schizoid Man\" and \"The Chimes of Big Ben\", and one new story, \"Your Beautiful Village\", written and directed by Nicholas Briggs, was released in January 2016 and was well received. The first series also featured John Standing, Celia Imrie, Ramon Tikaram and Michael Cochrane as Number Two and Helen Goldwyn as The Village Voice/Operations Controller.\nA second series was released in August 2017, comprising four stories: \"I Met a Man Today\" (adapted from \"Many Happy Returns\"), \"Project Six\" (adapted from \"A, B and C\"), an adaptation of \"Hammer into Anvil\", and new story \"Living in Harmony\" (not adapted from the TV episode of the same title).\nA third series was released in November 2019, comprising four stories: An adaptation of \"Free For All\", and new stories \"The Girl Who Was Death\" (using story elements, but not directly adapted, from the TV episode of the same title), \"The Seltzman Connection\", and \"No One Will Know\" (the last two using story elements from \"Do Not Forsake Me, O My Darling\").\nThese audio dramas have been broadcast by BBC Radio 4 Extra as part of its The 7th Dimension programming.\nCultural impact.\nAlthough the show was sold as a thriller in the mould of \"Danger Man\", McGoohan's previous series, its surreal and Kafkaesque setting and reflection of concerns of the 1960s counterculture have had a far-reaching influence on popular culture and the series ultimately developed a cult following.\nSince its debut, the series' enduring popularity has led to its influencing and being referenced in a range of other media, such as the film \"The Truman Show\", and the television shows \"Lost\" and \"The X-Files\". The producer of \"The X-Files\" called \"The Prisoner\" \"the \"Gone with the Wind\" of its genre.\" Mark Frost, co-creator of \"Twin Peaks\", has stated that \"The Prisoner\" was a large influence on him and the show. \"The Guardian\" wrote that \"Without \"The Prisoner\", we'd never have had cryptic, mindbending TV series like \"Twin Peaks\" or \"Lost\". It's the \"Citizen Kane\" of British TV \u2013 a programme that changed the landscape.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "31255", "revid": "46040862", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31255", "title": "Theseus", "text": "Legendary king of Athens who slayed the Minotaur\nTheseus (, ; ) was a divine hero in Greek mythology, famous for slaying the Minotaur. The myths surrounding Theseus, his journeys, exploits, and friends, have provided material for storytelling throughout the ages.\nTheseus is sometimes described as the son of Aegeus, king of Athens, and sometimes as the son of the god Poseidon. He is raised by his mother, Aethra, and upon discovering his connection to Aegeus, travels overland to Athens, having many adventures on the way. When he reaches Athens, he finds that Aegeus is married to Medea (formerly wife of Jason), who plots against him.\nThe most famous legend about Theseus is his slaying of the Minotaur, half man and half bull. He then goes on to unite Attica under Athenian rule: the \"synoikismos\" ('dwelling together'). As the unifying king, he is credited with building a palace on the fortress of the Acropolis. Pausanias reports that after \"synoikismos\", Theseus established a cult of Aphrodite ('Aphrodite of all the People') on the southern slope of the Acropolis.\nPlutarch's \"Life of Theseus\" makes use of varying accounts of the death of the Minotaur, Theseus's escape, and his romantic involvement with and betrayal of Ariadne, daughter of King Minos.\nPlutarch's avowed purpose is to construct a life that parallels the \"Life of Romulus\", the founding myth of Rome. Plutarch's sources, not all of whose texts have survived independently, include Pherecydes (mid-fifth\u00a0century\u00a0BC), Demon (c. 400\u00a0BC), Philochorus, and Cleidemus (both fourth\u00a0century\u00a0BC). As the subject of myth, the existence of Theseus as a real person has not been proven, but scholars believe that he may have been alive during the Late Bronze Age, or possibly as a king in the 8th or 9th century BC.\nBirth and early years.\nAegeus, one of the primordial kings of Athens, was childless. Desiring an heir, he asked the Oracle of Delphi for advice. Her cryptic words were \"Do not loosen the bulging mouth of the wineskin until you have reached the height of Athens, lest you die of grief.\" Aegeus did not understand the prophecy and was disappointed. He asked the advice of his host Pittheus, king of Troezen. Pittheus understood the prophecy, got Aegeus drunk, and gave Aegeus his daughter Aethra.\nBut following the instructions of Athena in a dream, Aethra left the sleeping Aegeus and waded across to the island of Sphairia that lay close to Troezen's shore. There, she poured a libation to Sphairos (Pelops's charioteer) and Poseidon and was possessed by the sea god in the night. The mix gave Theseus a combination of divine as well as mortal characteristics in his nature; such double paternity, with one immortal and one mortal, was a familiar feature of other Greek heroes. After Aethra became pregnant, Aegeus decided to return to Athens. Before leaving, however, he buried his sandals and sword under a huge rock and told Aethra that when their son grew up, he should move the rock, if he were heroic enough, and take the tokens for himself as evidence of his royal parentage. In Athens, Aegeus was joined by Medea, who had left Corinth after slaughtering the children she had borne to Jason, and had taken Aegeus as her new consort.\nThus Theseus was raised in his mother's land. When Theseus grew up to be a young man, he moved the rock and recovered his father's tokens. His mother then told him the truth about his father's identity and that he must take the sword and sandals back to the king Aegeus to claim his birthright. To journey to Athens, Theseus could choose to go by sea (which was the safe way) or by land, following a dangerous path around the Saronic Gulf, where he would encounter a string of six entrances to the Underworld, each guarded by a chthonic enemy. Young, brave, and ambitious, Theseus decided to go alone by the land route and defeated many bandits along the way.\nThe Six Labours.\nThe six entrances to the underworld, more commonly known as the Six Labours, are as follows:\nMedea, the Marathonian Bull, Androgeus, and the Pallantides.\nWhen Theseus arrived in Athens, he did not reveal his true identity immediately. Aegeus gave him hospitality but was suspicious of the young, powerful stranger's intentions. Aegeus's consort Medea recognized Theseus immediately as Aegeus's son and worried that Theseus would be chosen as heir to Aegeus's kingdom instead of her son Medus. She tried to arrange to have Theseus killed by asking him to capture the Marathonian Bull, an emblem of Cretan power.\nOn the way to Marathon, Theseus took shelter from a storm in the hut of an ancient woman named Hecale. She swore to make a sacrifice to Zeus if Theseus were successful in capturing the bull. Theseus did capture the bull, but when he returned to Hecale's hut, she was dead. In her honor, Theseus gave her name to one of the demes of Attica, making its inhabitants in a sense her adopted children.\nWhen Theseus returned victorious to Athens, where he sacrificed the Bull, Medea tried to poison him. At the last second, Aegeus recognized the sandals and the sword and knocked the poisoned wine cup from Theseus's hands. Thus father and son were reunited, and Medea fled to Asia.\nWhen Theseus appeared in the town, his reputation had preceded him, as a result of his having traveled along the notorious coastal road from Troezen and slain some of the most feared bandits there. It was not long before the Pallantides' hopes of succeeding the childless Aegeus would be lost if they did not get rid of Theseus (the Pallantides were the sons of Pallas and nephews of King Aegeus, who was then living at the royal court in the sanctuary of Delphic Apollo). So they set a trap for him. One band of them would march on the town from one side while another lay in wait near a place called Gargettus in ambush. The plan was that after Theseus, Aegeus, and the palace guards had been forced out the front, the other half would surprise them from behind. However, Theseus was not fooled. Informed of the plan by a herald named Leos, he crept out of the city at midnight and surprised the Pallantides. \"Theseus then fell suddenly upon the party lying in ambush, and slew them all. Thereupon the party with Pallas dispersed,\" Plutarch reported.\nTheseus and the Minotaur.\nPasipha\u00eb, wife of King Minos of Crete, had several children. The eldest of these, Androgeus, set sail for Athens to take part in the Panathenaic Games, which were held there every four years. Being strong and skillful, he did very well, winning some events outright. He soon became a crowd favorite, much to the resentment of the Pallantides, who assassinated him, incurring the wrath of Minos.\nWhen King Minos heard what had befallen his son, he ordered the Cretan fleet to set sail for Athens. Minos asked Aegeus for his son's assassins, saying that if they were to be handed to him, the city would be spared. However, not knowing who the assassins were, King Aegeus surrendered the whole city to Minos's mercy. His retribution was to stipulate that at the end of every Great Year, which occurred after every seven cycles on the solar calendar, the seven most courageous youths and the seven most beautiful maidens were to board a boat and be sent as tribute to Crete, never to be seen again.\nIn another version, King Minos had waged war with the Athenians and was successful. He then demanded that, at nine-year intervals, seven Athenian boys and seven Athenian girls were to be sent to Crete to be devoured by the Minotaur, a half-man, half-bull monster that lived in the Labyrinth created by Daedalus.\nOn the third occasion, Theseus volunteered to talk to the monster to stop this horror. He took the place of one of the youths and set off with a black sail, promising to his father, Aegeus, that if successful he would return with a white sail. Like the others, Theseus was stripped of his weapons when they sailed. On his arrival in Crete, Ariadne, King Minos's daughter, fell in love with Theseus and, on the advice of Daedalus, gave him a ball of thread (a clew), so he could find his way out of the Labyrinth. That night, Ariadne escorted Theseus to the Labyrinth, and Theseus promised that if he returned from the Labyrinth he would take Ariadne with him. As soon as Theseus entered the Labyrinth, he tied one end of the ball of string to the doorpost and brandished his sword which he had kept hidden from the guards inside his tunic. Theseus followed Daedalus's instructions given to Ariadne: go forwards, always down, and never left or right. Theseus came to the heart of the Labyrinth and upon the sleeping Minotaur. The beast awoke and a tremendous fight occurred. Theseus overpowered the Minotaur with his strength and stabbed the beast in the throat with his sword (according to one \"scholium\" on Pindar's Fifth Nemean Ode, Theseus strangled it).\nAfter decapitating the beast, Theseus used the string to escape the Labyrinth and managed to escape with all of the young Athenians and Ariadne as well as her younger sister Phaedra. Then he and the rest of the crew fell asleep on the beach of the island of Naxos, where they stopped on their way back, looking for water. Theseus then abandoned Ariadne, where Dionysus eventually found and married her. On his way back from Crete, he also stopped on the island of Delos, where, according to Plutarch, \"Theseus danced with the young Athenians a dance still performed by the inhabitants of the island, consisting of twisting and twisted movements that reproduce the shapes of the labyrinth. Dicearchos states that this dance is called 'Crane'.\" Theseus forgot to put up the white sails instead of the black ones, so his father, the king, believing he was dead, committed suicide, throwing himself off a cliff of Sounion and into the sea, causing this body of water to be named the Aegean Sea.\nShip of Theseus.\nAccording to Plutarch's \"Life of Theseus\", the ship Theseus used on his return from Minoan Crete to Athens was kept in the Athenian harbor as a memorial for several centuries.\nThe ship wherein Theseus and the youth of Athens returned had thirty oars, and was preserved by the Athenians down even to the time of Demetrius Phalereus, for they took away the old planks as they decayed, putting in new and stronger timber in their place...\nThe ship had to be maintained in a seaworthy state, for, in return for Theseus's successful mission, the Athenians had pledged to honor Apollo every year henceforth. Thus, the Athenians sent a religious mission to the island of Delos (one of Apollo's most sacred sanctuaries) on the Athenian state galley\u2014the ship itself\u2014to pay their fealty to the god. To preserve the purity of the occasion, no executions were permitted between the time when the religious ceremony began to when the ship returned from Delos, which took several weeks.\nTo preserve the ship, any wood that wore out or rotted was replaced; it was thus unclear to philosophers how much of the original ship remained, giving rise to the philosophical question of whether it should be considered \"the same\" ship or not. Such philosophical questions about the nature of identity are sometimes referred to as the \"Ship of Theseus\" paradox.\nRegardless of these issues, the Athenians preserved the ship. They believed that Theseus had been an actual, historical figure and the ship gave them a tangible connection to their divine provenance.\nTheseus and Pirithous.\nTheseus's best friend was Pirithous, king of the Lapiths. Pirithous had heard stories of Theseus's courage and strength in battle but wanted proof so he rustled Theseus's herd of cattle and drove it from Marathon and Theseus set out in pursuit. Pirithous took up his arms and the pair met to do battle but were so impressed with each other's gracefulness, beauty and courage they took an oath of friendship and joined the Calydonian boar hunt.\nIn \"Iliad\" I, Nestor numbers Pirithous and Theseus \"of heroic fame\" among an earlier generation of heroes of his youth, \"the strongest men that Earth has bred, the strongest men against the strongest enemies, a savage mountain-dwelling tribe whom they utterly destroyed.\" No trace of such an oral tradition, which Homer's listeners would have recognized in Nestor's allusion, survived in the literary epic. Later, Pirithous was preparing to marry Hippodamia. The centaurs were guests at the wedding feast, but got drunk and tried to abduct the women, including Hippodamia. The Lapiths won the ensuing battle.\nIn Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\" Theseus fights against and kills Eurytus, the \"fiercest of all the fierce centaurs\" at the wedding of Pirithous and Hippodamia.\nAlso according to Ovid, Phaedra, Theseus's wife, felt left out by her husband's love for Pirithous and she used this as an excuse to try to convince her stepson, Hippolytus, to accept being her lover, as Theseus also neglected his son because he preferred to spend long periods with his companion.\nAbduction of Persephone and encounter with Hades.\nTheseus, a great abductor of women, and his bosom companion, Pirithous, since they were sons of Zeus and Poseidon, pledged themselves to marry daughters of Zeus. Theseus, in an old tradition, chose Helen, and together they kidnapped her, intending to keep her until she was old enough to marry. Pirithous chose Persephone, even though she was already married to Hades, king of the underworld. They left Helen with Theseus's mother, Aethra at Aphidna, whence she was rescued by the Dioscuri.\nOn Pirithous's behalf they rather unwisely traveled to the underworld, domain of Persephone and her husband Hades. As they wandered through the outskirts of Tartarus, Theseus sat down to rest on a rock. As he did so he felt his limbs change and grow stiff. He tried to rise but could not. He was fixed to the rock. As he turned to cry out to his friend, he saw that Pirithous too was crying out. Around him gathered the terrible band of Furies with snakes in their hair, torches, and long whips in their hands. Before these monsters, the hero's courage failed and he was led away to eternal punishment.\nFor many months in half-darkness, Theseus sat immovably fixed to the rock, mourning for both his friend and for himself. In the end, he was rescued by Heracles who had come to the underworld for his 12th task. There he persuaded Persephone to forgive him for the part he had taken in the rash venture of Pirithous. So Theseus was restored to the upper air but Pirithous never left the kingdom of the dead, for when Heracles tried to free Pirithous, the underworld shook. They then decided the task was beyond any hero and left. When Theseus returned to Athens, he found that the Dioscuri had taken Helen and Aethra to Sparta.\nPhaedra and Hippolytus.\nPhaedra, Theseus's second wife and the daughter of King Minos, bore Theseus two sons, Demophon and Acamas. While these two were still in their infancy, Phaedra fell in love with Hippolytus, Theseus's son by the Amazon queen Hippolyta. According to some versions of the story, Hippolytus had scorned Aphrodite to become a follower of Artemis, so Aphrodite made Phaedra fall in love with him as punishment. He rejected her out of chastity.\nAlternatively, in Euripides's version, \"Hippolytus\", Phaedra's nurse told Hippolytus of her mistress's love and he swore he would not reveal the nurse as his source of information. To ensure that she would die with dignity, Phaedra wrote to Theseus on a tablet claiming that Hippolytus had raped her before hanging herself. Theseus believed her and used one of the three wishes he had received from Poseidon against his son. The curse caused Hippolytus's horses to be frightened by a sea monster, usually a bull, and to drag their rider to his death. Artemis would later tell Theseus the truth, promising to avenge her loyal follower on another follower of Aphrodite.\nIn a version recounted by the Roman playwright Seneca, entitled \"Phaedra\", after Phaedra told Theseus that Hippolytus had raped her, Theseus called upon Neptune (as he did Poseidon in Euripides's interpretation) to kill his son. Upon hearing the news of Hippolytus's death at the hands of Neptune's sea monster, Phaedra committed suicide out of guilt, for she had not intended for Hippolytus to die.\nIn yet another version, Phaedra simply told Theseus Hippolytus had raped her and did not kill herself. Dionysus sent a wild bull that terrified Hippolytus's horses.\nA cult grew up around Hippolytus, associated with the cult of Aphrodite. Girls who were about to be married offered locks of their hair to him. The cult believed that Asclepius had resurrected Hippolytus and that he lived in a sacred forest near Aricia in Latium.\nOther stories and death of Theseus.\nAccording to some sources, Theseus also was one of the Argonauts, although Apollonius of Rhodes states in the \"Argonautica\" that Theseus was still in the underworld at this time. Both statements are inconsistent with Medea being Aegeus's wife by the time Theseus first came to Athens. With Phaedra, Theseus fathered Acamas, who was one of those who hid in the Trojan Horse during the Trojan War. Theseus welcomed the wandering Oedipus and helped Adrastus to bury the Seven against Thebes.\nPausanias wrote that on the road through the mountains from Troezen to Hermione there was a large rock that was originally called the altar of Zeus Sthenius, but was later renamed the Rock of Theseus, because Theseus took up the sword and sandals of his father from beneath it.\nLycomedes of the island of Skyros threw Theseus off a cliff after he had lost popularity in Athens. In 475 BC, in response to an oracle, Cimon of Athens, having conquered Skyros for the Athenians, identified as the remains of Theseus \"a coffin of a great corpse with a bronze spear-head by its side and a sword.\" (Plutarch, \"Life of Theseus\"). The remains found by Cimon were reburied in Athens. The early modern name \"Theseion\" (Temple of Theseus) was mistakenly applied to the Temple of Hephaestus which was thought to be the actual site of the hero's tomb.\nReferences.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nPrimary sources\nSecondary sources"}

The rates and merits of the various taxes, imposed by the authorities, are attained via the political process inherent in these bodies of power, and not directly attributable to the actual domain of tax law itself.\nTax law is part of public law. It covers the application of existing tax laws on individuals, entities and corporations, in areas where tax revenue is derived or levied, e.g. income tax, estate tax, business tax, employment/payroll tax, property tax, gift tax and exports/imports tax. There have been some arguments that consumer law is a better way to engage in large-scale redistribution than tax law because it does not necessitate legislation and can be more efficient, given the complexities of tax law.\nMajor issues.\nPrimary taxation issues differ among various countries, although similarities might exist.\nEducation.\nAustralia.\nTax law education is a specialisation of accountants, tax agents, and lawyers. Accountants are required by either CPA Australia to complete a course in law of taxation and law of financial services. There is a legal obligation to complete taxation law and commercial law for registration as a tax agent with the Tax Practitioner's Board. Law students are not typically required to complete a unit in tax law, but may opt to take it as an elective in Australian universities.\nPertaining to other countries.\nPost law school.\nIn Africa.\nMost African countries use the British legal education curriculum in their law educational system to train lawyers.\nOverall, legal education, across African countries, starts at the university level as an undergraduate course although a few universities have promulgated a law degree as a graduate program \"akin to [that] \u2026 in the United States, Canada, and India.\"\nIn most African countries, a law degree does not necessarily qualify one to practice as a lawyer. Further post-graduate practical training is required.\nGraduates earn an undergraduate law degree, viz. the Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.), via a four-year program (as in Malawi, Kenya, Zambia, and most of South African law universities). Subsequently, graduates with the Bachelor of Laws seek to earn the Master of Laws or greater in order to become practitioners of the law. Some law institutions offer tracks to a Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.), a Doctor of Philosophy degree (Ph.D.), or a Doctor of Laws degree (LL.D.) with emphasis on tax law.\nA list of tax faculty ranked by publication downloads is maintained by Paul Caron at TaxProf Blog.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The middle three fingers often fall along the speaker's cheeks with the little finger picking up the vibrations of the speaker's throat. It is sometimes referred to as \"tactile lipreading\", as the listener feels the movement of the lips, the vibrations of the vocal cords, expansion of the cheeks and the warm air produced by nasal phonemes such as 'N' and 'M'. Hand positioning can vary, and it is a sometimes also used by hard-of-hearing people to supplement their remaining hearing.\nIn some cases, especially if the speaker knows sign language, the deafblind listener may use the Tadoma method with one hand on the speaker's face, and their other hand on the speaker\u2019s signing hand to hear the words. In this way, the two methods reinforce each other, increasing the chances of the listener understanding the speaker.\nThe Tadoma method can also help a deafblind person retain speech skills they may have had otherwise.

Its population was 196,935 as of December 2021. Previously, it was the capital of the Toru\u0144 Voivodeship (1975\u20131998) and the Pomeranian Voivodeship (1921\u20131945). Since 1999, Toru\u0144 has been a seat of the local government of the Kuyavian\u2013Pomeranian Voivodeship and is one of its two capitals, together with Bydgoszcz. The cities and neighboring counties form the Bydgoszcz\u2013Toru\u0144 twin city metropolitan area.\nToru\u0144 is one of the oldest cities in Poland; it was first settled in the 8th century and in 1233 was expanded by the Teutonic Knights. For centuries it was home to people of diverse backgrounds and religions. From 1264 until 1411, Toru\u0144 was part of the Hanseatic League and by the 17th century a leading trading point, which greatly affected the city's architecture, ranging from Brick Gothic to Mannerist and Baroque.\nIn the Early Modern period, Toru\u0144 was a royal city of Poland and one of Poland's four largest cities. With the partitions of Poland in the late 18th century, it became part of Prussia, then of the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw, serving as the temporary Polish capital in 1809, then again of Prussia, of the German Empire and, after World War I, of the reborn Polish Republic. During the Second World War, Toru\u0144 was spared bombing and destruction; its Old Town and iconic central marketplace have been entirely preserved.\nToru\u0144 is renowned for its gingerbread \u2013 the gingerbread-baking tradition dates back nearly a millennium \u2013 as well as for its large Cathedral. It hosts the Camerimage International Film Festival of the Art of Cinematography. Toru\u0144 is noted for its very high standard of living and quality of life. In 1997 the medieval part of the city was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In 2007 the Old Town of Toru\u0144 was added to the list of Seven Wonders of Poland.\nToponymy.\nThe exact origin of the city's name is unknown. According to the findings of some linguists and historians, it is derived from the Old Slavic word \"tor\" (meaning \"a beaten path\").\nThe settlement was first mentioned in 1226 under the name \"Thorun\". In later documents, it also appeared as \"Turon\", \"Turun\", and \"Thoron\". From the 15th century onward, the monosyllabic form came into use.\nThe city's Latin name may be given as either \"Thorunium\" or \"Thorunum\".\nHistory.\nMiddle Ages.\nThe first settlement in the vicinity of Toru\u0144 is dated by archaeologists to 1100 BC (Lusatian culture). During early medieval times, in the 7th through 13th centuries, it was the location of an old Slavonic settlement, at a ford of the river Vistula. In the 10th century it became part of the emerging Polish state ruled by the Piast dynasty.\nIn spring 1231 the Teutonic Knights crossed the river Vistula near the town of Nieszawa and established a fortress. On 28 December 1233, Teutonic Knights Hermann von Salza and Hermann Balk signed the city charters for Toru\u0144 (\"Thorn\") and Che\u0142mno (\"Kulm\"). The original document was lost in 1244. The set of rights in general is known as Kulm law. In 1236, due to frequent flooding, it was relocated to the present site of the Old Town. In 1239 Franciscan friars settled in the city, followed in 1263 by Dominicans. In 1264 the adjacent New Town was founded, predominantly to house Torun's growing population of craftsmen and artisans, who predominantly came from German-speaking lands.\nIn 1280, the city (or as it was then, both cities) joined the mercantile Hanseatic League, and thus became an important medieval trade centre.\nIn the 14th century, papal verdicts ordered the restoration of the area to Poland; however, the Teutonic Knights did not comply and continued to occupy the region. The city was recaptured by Poland in 1410 during the Polish\u2013Lithuanian\u2013Teutonic War. During the war, the city council maintained contact and cooperated with Polish King W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o; however, after the First Peace of Thorn was signed in the city in February 1411, the city fell back to the Teutonic Order. In 1411, the city left the Hanseatic League. In the 1420s, Polish King W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o built the Dyb\u00f3w Castle, located in present-day left-bank Toru\u0144, which he visited numerous times. During the next big Polish\u2013Teutonic War, Dyb\u00f3w Castle was occupied by the Teutonic Knights from 1431 to 1435. The city refused to pay taxes to the Teutonic Knights, not wanting to finance their war against Poland.\nIn 1440, the gentry of Toru\u0144 co-founded the Prussian Confederation to further oppose the Knights' policies. From 1452, talks between Polish King Casimir IV Jagiellon and the burghers of the Confederation were held at Dyb\u00f3w Castle. The Confederation rose against the Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights in 1454 and its delegation submitted a petition to Polish King Casimir IV Jagiellon asking him to regain power over the region as its rightful ruler. An act of incorporation was signed in Krak\u00f3w 6 March 1454, recognizing the region (including Toru\u0144), as part of the Polish Kingdom.\nThese events led to the Thirteen Years' War. The citizens of the city, enraged by the Order's ruthless exploitation, conquered the Teutonic castle, and dismantled the fortifications brick by brick, except for the Gdanisko tower which was used until the 18th century to store gunpowder. The local mayor pledged allegiance to the Polish king during the incorporation in March 1454 in Krak\u00f3w, and then in May 1454, an official ceremony was held in Toru\u0144, in which the nobility, knights, landowners, mayors, and local officials from Che\u0142mno Land, including Toru\u0144, again solemnly swore allegiance to the Polish king and the Kingdom of Poland. Since 1454, the city has been authorized by King Casimir IV to mint Polish coins. During the war, Casimir IV often stayed at the Dyb\u00f3w Castle and Toru\u0144 financially supported the Polish Army. The New Town and Old Town amalgamated in 1454.\nThe Thirteen Years' War ended in 1466, with the Second Peace of Thorn, in which the Teutonic Order renounced any claims to the city and recognised it as part of Poland. The Polish king granted the town great privileges, similar to those of Gda\u0144sk. Also in 1454 at Dyb\u00f3w Castle, the King issued the famous Statutes of Nieszawa, covering a set of privileges for the Polish nobility; an event that is regarded as the birth of the noble democracy in Poland, which lasted until the country's demise in 1795.\nEarly modern period.\nIn 1473, Nicolaus Copernicus was born, and in 1501 Polish king John I Albert died in Toru\u0144; his heart was buried in St. John's Cathedral. In 1500, the Tuba Dei, the largest church bell in Poland at the time, was installed at Toru\u0144 Cathedral, and a bridge across the Vistula was built, the country's longest wooden bridge at the time. In 1506, Toru\u0144 became a royal city of Poland. In 1528, the royal mint started operating in Toru\u0144. In 1568, a gymnasium was founded, which after 1594 became one of the leading schools of northern Poland for centuries to come. Also in 1594, Toru\u0144's first museum (\"Musaeum\") was established at the school, beginning the city's museal traditions. A city of great wealth and influence, it enjoyed voting rights during the royal election period. Sejms of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth were held in Toru\u0144 in 1576 and 1626.\nIn 1557, during the Protestant Reformation, the city adopted Protestantism. Under Mayor Henryk Stroband (1586\u20131609), the city became centralized. Administrative power passed into the hands of the city council. In 1595, Jesuits arrived to promote the Counter-Reformation, taking control of St John's Church. Protestant city officials tried to limit the influx of Catholics into the city, as Catholics (Jesuits and Dominican friars) already controlled most of the churches, leaving only St Mary's for Protestant citizens. In 1645, at a time when religious conflicts occurred in many other European countries and the disastrous Thirty Years' War was fought west of Poland, in Toru\u0144, on the initiative of King W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa, a three-month congress of European Catholics, Lutherans, and Calvinists was held, known as \"Colloquium Charitativum;\" an important event in the history of interreligious dialogue.\nDuring the Great Northern War (1700\u201321), the city was besieged by Swedish troops. The restoration of Augustus II the Strong as King of Poland was prepared in the city in the Treaty of Thorn (1709) by the Russian tsar Peter the Great. In the second half of the 17th century, tensions between Catholics and Protestants grew. In the early 18th century about 50 percent of the populace, especially the gentry and middle class, were German-speaking Protestants, while the other 50 percent were Polish-speaking Roman Catholics. Protestant influence was subsequently pushed back after the Tumult of Thorn of 1724.\nLate modern period (from 1793).\nAfter the Second Partition of Poland in 1793, the city was annexed by Prussia. It was briefly regained by Poles as part of the Duchy of Warsaw in 1807\u20131815, even serving as the temporary capital in April and May 1809. During these years the city began to attract a growing Jewish community. In 1809, Toru\u0144 was successfully defended by the Poles against the Austrians. After being re-annexed by Prussia in 1815, Toru\u0144 was subjected to Germanisation and became a strong center of Polish resistance against such policies. The city's first synagogue was inaugurated in 1847. New Polish institutions were established, such as Towarzystwo Naukowe w Toruniu (\"Toru\u0144 Scientific Society\"), a major Polish institution in the Prussian Partition of Poland, founded in 1875. After World War I, Poland declared independence and regained control over the city. In interwar Poland, Toru\u0144 was the capital of the Pomeranian Voivodeship.\nWorld War II.\nDuring World War II, Germany occupied the city from 7 September 1939 to 1 February 1945. \"Einsatzkommando 16\" entered the city to commit various crimes against Poles. Under German occupation, local people were subjected to arrests, expulsions, slave labor, deportations to concentration camps and executions, especially the Polish elites as part of the \"Intelligenzaktion\".\nA group of Polish railwaymen and policemen from Toru\u0144 were murdered by the German gendarmerie and \"Wehrmacht\" in G\u0105bin on 19\u201321 September 1939. Local Poles, including activists, teachers and priests, arrested in Toru\u0144 and Toru\u0144 County beginning in September 1939, were initially held in the pre-war prison, and after it became overcrowded in October 1939, the Germans imprisoned Poles in Fort VII of the Toru\u0144 Fortress. On 17\u201319 October 1939 alone, the German police and the \"Selbstschutz\" arrested 1,200 Poles in Toru\u0144 and Toru\u0144 County. In early November 1939, the Germans carried out further mass arrests of Polish teachers, farmers and priests in Toru\u0144 and the county, who were then imprisoned in Fort VII. Imprisoned Poles were then either deported to concentration camps or murdered onsite.\nLarge massacres of over 1,100 Poles from the city and region, including teachers, school principals, local officials, restaurateurs, shop owners, merchants, farmers, railwaymen, policemen, craftsmen, students, priests, workers, doctors, were carried out in the present-day district of Barbarka. Six mass graves were discovered after the war, in five of which the bodies of the victims were burned, as the Germans had tried to cover up the crime. Local teachers were also among Polish teachers murdered in the Sachsenhausen-Oranienburg, Mauthausen and Dachau concentration camps. Nonetheless, the Polish resistance movement was active in the city, and Toru\u0144 was the seat of one of the six main commands of the Union of Armed Struggle in occupied Poland (alongside Warsaw, Krak\u00f3w, Pozna\u0144, Bia\u0142ystok and Lw\u00f3w).\nDuring the occupation, Germany established and operated Stalag XX-A prisoner-of-war camp in the city, with multiple forced labour subcamps in the region, in which Polish, British, French, Australian and Soviet POWs were held. From 1940 to 1943, in the northern part of the city the German transit camp Umsiedlungslager Thorn for Poles expelled from Toru\u0144 and the surrounding area, became infamous for inhuman sanitary conditions. Over 12,000 Poles passed through the camp, and around 1,000 died there, including about 400 children. From 1941 to 1945, a German forced labour camp was located in the city. In the spring of 1942, the Germans murdered 30 Polish scouts aged 13\u201316 in Fort VII.\nWhile the city's population suffered many atrocities, as described, there were no battles or bombings that damaged its buildings. Thus, the city avoided damage during both World Wars, and retained its historic architecture, ranging from Gothic through Renaissance and Baroque to 19th and 20th century styles.\nSights.\nListed on the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites since 1997, Toru\u0144 has many monuments of architecture dating back to the Middle Ages. The city is famous for having preserved almost intact its medieval spatial layout and many Gothic buildings, all built from brick, including monumental churches, the Town Hall and many burgher houses.\nGothic architecture.\nToru\u0144 has the largest number of preserved Gothic houses in Poland, many with Gothic wall paintings or wood-beam ceilings from the 16th to the 18th centuries.\nToru\u0144, unlike many other historic cities in Poland, escaped substantial destruction in World War II. Particularly left intact was the Old Town, all of whose important architectural monuments are originals, not reconstructions.\nMajor renovation projects have been undertaken in recent years to improve the condition and external presentation of the Old Town. Besides the renovation of various buildings, projects such as the reconstruction of the pavement of the streets and squares (reversing them to their historical appearance), and the introduction of new plants, trees and objects of 'small architecture', are underway.\nNumerous buildings and other constructions, including the city walls along the boulevard, are illuminated at night, creating an impressive effect \u2013 probably unique among Polish cities with respect to the size of Toru\u0144's Old Town and the scale of the illumination project itself.\nToru\u0144 is also home to the Zoo and Botanical Garden opened in 1965 and 1797 respectively and is one of the city's popular tourist attractions.\nDistricts.\nToru\u0144 is divided into 24 administrative districts (dzielnica) or boroughs, each with a degree of autonomy within its own municipal government. The Districts include: Barbarka, Bielany, Bielawy, Bydgoskie Przedmie\u015bcie, Che\u0142mi\u0144skie Przedmie\u015bcie, Czerniewice, Glinki, Gr\u0119bocin nad Strug\u0105, Jakubskie Przedmie\u015bcie, Kaszczorek, Katarzynka, Koniuchy, Mokre, Na Skarpie, Piaski, Podg\u00f3rz, Rubinkowo, Rudak, Rybaki, Stare Miasto (\"Old Town\"), Starotoru\u0144skie Przedmie\u015bcie, Stawki, Winnica, Wrzosy.\nSymbols.\nThe colors of Toru\u0144 are white and blue in the horizontal arrangement, white top, blue bottom, equal in size. The flag of the city of Toru\u0144 is a bipartite sheet. The upper field is white, the lower field is blue. If the flag is hung vertically, the upper edge of the flag must be on the left.\nThe flag with the coat of arms is also in use. The ratio of the height of the coat of arms to the width of the flag is 1:2.\nClimate.\nThe climate can be described as humid continental (K\u00f6ppen: \"Dfb\") if the isotherm of is used or an oceanic climate (\"Cfb\") if the isotherm is adopted. Back in 1930s, the city passed close to the original boundary and dividing line of climates C and D groups in the north\u2013south direction proposed by climatologist Wladimir K\u00f6ppen. Toru\u0144 is in the transition between the milder climates of the west and north of the Poland and the more extreme ones like the south (warmer summer) and the east (colder winter). It is not much different from the climates of more southerly Krak\u00f3w and easterly Warsaw, though it has slightly milder winters and more moderate summers.\nBeing close to definitely continental climates, it has a high variability caused by the contact of eastern continental air masses and western oceanic ones. This is influenced by the geographical location of the city\u00a0\u2013 the Toru\u0144 Basin to the south, and the Vistula Valley to the north.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe most recent statistics show a decrease in the population of the city, from 211,169 in 2001 (highest) to 202,562 in 2018. Among the demographic trends influencing this decline, are: suburbanisation, migration to larger urban centres, and wider trends observed in the whole of Poland such as general population decline, slowed down by immigration in 2017. The birth rate in the city in 2017 was 0.75. Low birthrates have been consistent in the city for the first two decades of 21st Century.\nThe official forecasts from Statistics Poland state that by 2050 the city population will have declined to 157,949.\nInside the city itself, most of the population is concentrated on the right (northern) bank of the Vistula river. Two of the most densely populated areas are Rubinkowo and Na Skarpie, housing projects built mostly in the 1970s and 1980s, located between the central and easternmost districts; their total population is about 70,000.\nThe Bydgoszcz\u2013Toru\u0144 metro area of Toru\u0144 and Bydgoszcz, their counties, and a number of smaller towns, may in total have a population of as much as 800,000. Thus the area contains about one third of the population of the Kuyavia-Pomerania region (which has about 2.1 million inhabitants).\nTransport.\nThe transport network in the city has undergone major development in recent years. The partial completion of ring road (East and South), the completion of the second bridge (2013) and various road, and cycling lane improvements, including construction of Trasa \u015arednicowa, have decidedly improved the traffic in the city. However, noise barriers that have been erected along the new or refurbished roads have been criticised as not conducive to a beautiful urban landscape. The extensive roadworks have also drawn attention to the declining population numbers, casting doubt that the city might over-deliver for the future number of road users, as the demographic trends forecast from Statistics Poland predicts a reduction of population by almost 1/4 by year 2050.\nThe city's public transport system consists of an extensive tram network with seven lines. The Tram network operates exclusively on the northern bank of the Vistula river.\nIn addition to the tram network, the city runs 40 day time bus routes and six night time bus routes, covering the city and some of the neighboring communities including the southern side of the city.\nToru\u0144 is situated at a major road junction, one of the most important in Poland. The A1 highway reaches Toru\u0144, and a southern beltway surrounds the city. Besides these, the European route E75 and a number of domestic roads (numbered 10, 15, and 80) run through the city.\nWith three main railway stations (Toru\u0144 G\u0142\u00f3wny, Toru\u0144 Miasto and Toru\u0144 Wschodni), the city is a major rail junction, with two important lines crossing there (Warsaw\u2013Bydgoszcz and Wroc\u0142aw\u2013Olsztyn). Two other lines stem from Toru\u0144, toward Malbork and Sierpc.\nThe rail connection with Bydgoszcz is run under a name \"BiT City\" as a \"metropolitan rail\". Its main purpose is to allow traveling between and within these cities using one ticket. A joint venture of Toru\u0144, Bydgoszcz, Solec Kujawski and the voivodeship, it is considered as important in integrating Bydgoszcz-Toru\u0144 metropolitan area. A major modernization of BiT City railroute, as well as a purchase of completely new vehicles to serve the line, is planned for 2008 and 2009. Technically, it will allow to travel between Toru\u0144-East and Bydgoszcz-Airport stations at a speed of in a time of approximately half an hour. In a few years' time \"BiT City\" will be integrated with local transportation systems of Toru\u0144 and Bydgoszcz, thus creating a uniform metropolitan transportation network\u00a0\u2013 with all necessary funds having been secured in 2008.\nSince September 2008, the \"one-ticket\" solution has been introduced also as regards a rail connection with W\u0142oc\u0142awek, as a \"regional ticket\". The same is planned for connection with Grudzi\u0105dz.\nTwo bus depots serve to connect the city with other towns and cities in Poland.\nAs of 2008[ [update]], a small sport airfield exists in Toru\u0144; however, a modernization of the airport is seriously considered with a number of investors interested in it. Independently of this, Bydgoszcz Ignacy Jan Paderewski Airport, located about from Toru\u0144 city centre, serves the whole Bydgoszcz-Toru\u0144 metropolitan area, with a number of regular flights to European cities.\nEconomy.\nAlthough a medium-sized city, Toru\u0144 is the site of the headquarters of some of the largest companies in Poland, or at least of their subsidiaries. The official unemployment rate, as of September 2008[ [update]], is 5.4%.\nIn 2006, construction of new plants owned by Sharp Corporation and other companies of mainly Japanese origin has started in the neighboring community of \u0141ysomice \u2013 about from city centre. The facilities under construction are located in a newly created special economic zone. As a result of cooperation of the companies mentioned above, a vast high-tech complex is to be constructed in the next few years, providing as many as 10,000 jobs (a prediction for ) at the cost of about 450 million euros. As of 2008[ [update]], the creation of another special economic zone is being considered, this time inside city limits.\nThanks to its architectural heritage Toru\u0144 is visited by more than 1.5 million tourists a year (1.6 million in 2007). This makes tourism an important branch of the local economy, although time spent in the city by individual tourists or the number of hotels, which can serve them, are still not considered satisfactory. Major investments in renovation of the city's monuments, building new hotels (including high-standard ones), improvement in promotion, as well as launching new cultural and scientific events and facilities, give very good prospects for Toru\u0144's tourism.\nIn recent years Toru\u0144 has been a site of intense building construction investments, mainly residential and in its transportation network. The latter has been possible partly due to the use of European Union funds assigned for new member states. Toru\u0144 city county generates by far the highest number of new dwellings built each year among all Kuyavian-Pomeranian counties, both relative to its population as well as in absolute values. It has led to almost complete rebuilding of some districts. As of 2008[ [update]], many major constructions are either under development or are to be launched soon \u2013 the value of some of them exceeding 100 million euros. They include a new speedway stadium, major shopping and entertainment centres, a commercial complex popularly called a \"New Centre of Toru\u0144\", a music theater, a centre of contemporary art, hotels, office buildings, facilities for the Nicolaus Copernicus University, roads and tram routes, sewage and fresh water delivery systems, residential projects, the possibility of a new bridge over the Vistula, and more. Construction of the A1 motorway and the BiT City fast metropolitan railway also directly affects the city. About 25,000 local firms are registered in Toru\u0144.\nCulture.\nThe internationally renowned film festival Camerimage was founded in Toru\u0144 in 1993, and has been held annually in the city since 2019. In 2024, with Australian actress Cate Blanchett as jury president, the 32nd International Film Festival of the Art of Cinematography Camerimage screened Steve McQueen's historical war drama \"Blitz\", the first half of Jon M. Chu's two-part musical fantasy film \"Wicked\", and the world premiere of Joel Souza's western film \"Rust\".\nToru\u0144 has two drama theatres (\"Teatr im. Wilama Horzycy\" with three stages and \"Teatr Wiczy\"), two children's theatres (\"Baj Pomorski\" and \"Zaczarowany \u015awiat\"), two music theatres (\"Ma\u0142a Rewia\", \"Studencki Teatr Ta\u0144ca\"), and numerous other theatre groups. The city hosts, among others events, the international theatre festival, \"Kontakt\", annually in May.\nA building called \"Baj Pomorski\" has recently been completely reconstructed. It is now one of the most modern cultural facilities in the city, with its front elevation in the shape of a gigantic chest of drawers. It is located at the south-east edge of the Old Town. Toru\u0144 has two cinemas including a Cinema City, which has over 2,000 seats.\nOver ten major museums document the history of Toru\u0144 and the region. Among others, the \"House of Kopernik\" and the accompanying museum commemorate Nicolaus Copernicus and his revolutionary work, the university museum reveals the history of the city's academic past.\nThe Tony Halik Travelers' Museum (Muzeum Podr\u00f3\u017cnik\u00f3w im. Tony Halika) was established in 2003 after El\u017cbieta Dzikowska donated to citizens of Toru\u0144 a collection of objects from various countries and cultures following the death of her husband, famous explorer and writer, Toru\u0144 native, Tony Halik. It is managed by the District Museum in Toru\u0144.\nThe Centre of Contemporary Art (\"Centrum Sztuki Wsp\u00f3\u0142czesnej\" \u2013 \"CSW\") opened in June 2008 and is one of the most important cultural facilities of this kind in Poland. The modern building is located in the very centre of the city, adjacent to the Old Town. The Toru\u0144 Symphonic Orchestra (formerly the Toru\u0144 Chamber Orchestra) is well-rooted in the Toru\u0144 cultural landscape.\nToru\u0144 is home to a planetarium (located downtown) and an astronomical observatory (located in nearby village of Piwnice). The latter boasts the largest radio telescope in Central Europe with a diameter of , second only to the Effelsberg radio telescope.\nToru\u0144 is well known for gingerbread, a type of piernik often made in elaborate molds. Museum of Toru\u0144 Gingerbread is a large museum dedicated to it. There are also several gingerbread workshops in the town that offer hands-on experiences for tourists, including the popular Living Museum of Gingerbread. The 15-year-old composer Fryderyk Chopin was smitten with Toru\u0144 gingerbread when he visited his godfather, Fryderyk Skarbek, there in the summer of 1825.\nToru\u0144 is a center of conservative Roman Catholic culture. Redemptorist Tadeusz Rydzyk has organized here Radio Maryja, Telewizja Trwam, a college whose students contribute to the mentioned media. Now a museum is being constructed.\nThe 12999 Toru\u0144 asteroid is named after the city.\nEducation.\nOver 30 elementary and primary schools and over ten high schools make up the educational base of Toru\u0144. Besides these, students can also attend a handful of private schools.\nThe largest institution of higher education in Toru\u0144, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toru\u0144, serves over 20,000 students and was founded in 1945, based on the Toru\u0144 Scientific Society, Stefan Batory University in Wilno, and Jan Kazimierz University in Lw\u00f3w. The existence of a high-ranked and high-profiled university with so many students plays a great role the city's position and importance in general, as well as in creating an image of Toru\u0144's streets and clubs filled with crowds of young people. It also has a serious influence on local economy.\nOther public institutions of higher education:\nThere are also a number of private higher education facilities:\nAlso located in Toru\u0144 is one of the oldest high schools in Poland, , which dates back to a gymnasium founded in 1568.\nHealthcare.\nSix hospitals of various specializations provide medical service for Toru\u0144 itself, its surrounding area, and to the region in general. The two largest of these hospitals, recently run by the voivodeship, were to be taken over by Nicolaus Copernicus University and run as its clinical units. At least one of them was to change its status in 2008. In addition, there are a number of other healthcare facilities in the city.\nSports.\nOther clubs:\nNotable people.\nNotable residents of Toru\u0144 include:\nInternational relations.\nHonouring Toru\u0144's sister relationship with Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the Bulwar Filadelfijski (\"Philadelphia Boulevard\"), a long street running mostly between Vistula River and walls of the Old Town and the boulevard itself, bears its name. The \u015alimak Gety\u0144ski is one of the lanes connecting Pi\u0142sudski Bridge / John Paul II Avenue with Philadelphia Boulevard at their downtown interchange. It honours the relationship with G\u00f6ttingen, its name derived from the street's half-circular shape (Polish word \"\u015blimak\" meaning \"snail\").\nTwin towns \u2013 Sister cities.\nToru\u0144 is twinned with:\nFormer twin towns:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The river flows south from the mountains of the Armenian Highlands through the Syrian and Arabian Deserts, before merging with the Euphrates and reaching to the Persian Gulf.\nThe Tigris passes through historical cities like Mosul, Tikrit, Samarra, and Baghdad. It is also home to archaeological sites and ancient religious communities, including the Mandaeans, who use it for baptism. In ancient times, the Tigris nurtured the Assyrian Empire, with remnants like the relief of King Tiglath-Pileser.\nToday, the Tigris faces modern threats from geopolitical instability, dam projects, poor water management, and climate change, leading to concerns about its sustainability. Efforts to protect and preserve the river's legacy are ongoing, with local archaeologists and activists working to safeguard its future.\nEtymology.\nFrom Latin Tigris, from Ancient Greek \u03a4\u03af\u03b3\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2 (T\u00edgris), an alternative form of \u03a4\u03af\u03b3\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2 (T\u00edgr\u0113s), from Old Persian \ud800\udfab\ud800\udfa1\ud800\udfa5\ud800\udfbc\ud800\udfa0 (Tigr\u0101), from Akkadian \ud808\udc00\ud808\uddc9\ud808\ude26\ud808\udd18\ud808\udcfc (Idiglat), from Sumerian \ud808\udc00\ud808\uddc9\ud808\ude26\ud808\udd18\ud808\udcfc (Idigna, literally \u201cfast as an arrow\u201d).\nThe Ancient Greek form () probably derived from \"running water\"). The Sumerian term, which can be interpreted as \"the swift river\", contrasts the Tigris to its neighbour, the Euphrates, whose leisurely pace caused it to deposit more silt and build up a higher bed than the Tigris. The Sumerian form was borrowed into Akkadian as and from there into the other Semitic languages (compare ; or ; , ).\nIn Kurdish languages, it is known as , \"the Great Water\".\nThe name of the Tigris in languages that have been important in the region:\nGeography.\nThe Tigris is long, rising in the Taurus Mountains of eastern Turkey about southeast of the city of Elaz\u0131\u011f and about from the headwaters of the Euphrates. The river then flows for through Southeastern Turkey before forming part of the Syria-Turkey border. This stretch of is the only part of the river that is located in Syria. Some of its affluences are Garzan, Anbar\u00e7ayi, Batman, and the Great and the Little Zab.\nClose to its confluence with the Euphrates, the Tigris splits into several channels. First, the artificial Shatt al-Hayy branches off, to join the Euphrates near Nasiriyah. Second, the Shatt al-Muminah and Majar al-Kabir branch off to feed the Central Marshes. Further downstream, two other distributary channels branch off (the Al-Musharrah and Al-Kahla), to feed the Hawizeh Marshes. The main channel continues southwards and is joined by the Al-Kassarah, which drains the Hawizeh Marshes. Finally, the Tigris joins the Euphrates near al-Qurnah to form the Shatt-al-Arab. According to Pliny and other ancient historians, the Euphrates originally had its outlet into the sea separate from that of the Tigris.\nBaghdad, the capital of Iraq, stands on the banks of the Tigris. The port city of Basra straddles the Shatt al-Arab. In ancient times, many of the great cities of Mesopotamia stood on or near the Tigris, drawing water from it to irrigate the civilization of the Sumerians. Notable Tigris-side cities included Nineveh, Ctesiphon, and Seleucia, while the city of Lagash was irrigated by the Tigris via a canal dug around 2900 B.C.\nNavigation.\nThe Tigris has long been an important transport route in a largely desert country. Shallow-draft vessels can go as far as Baghdad, but rafts have historically been needed for transport downstream from Mosul.\nManagement and water quality.\nThe Tigris is heavily dammed in Iraq and Turkey to provide water for irrigating the arid and semi-desert regions bordering the river valley. Damming has also been important for averting floods in Iraq, to which the Tigris has historically been notoriously prone following April melting of snow in the Turkish mountains. Mosul Dam is the largest dam in Iraq.\nRecent Turkish damming of the river has been the subject of some controversy, for both its environmental effects within Turkey and its potential to reduce the flow of water downstream.\nWater from both rivers is used as a means of pressure during conflicts.\nIn 2014 a major breakthrough in developing consensus between multiple stakeholder representatives of Iraq and Turkey on a Plan of Action for promoting exchange and calibration of data and standards pertaining to Tigris river flows was achieved. The consensus, known as the \"Geneva Consensus On Tigris River\", was reached at a meeting organized in Geneva by the think tank Strategic Foresight Group.\nIn February 2016, the United States Embassy in Iraq as well as the Prime Minister of Iraq Haider al-Abadi issued warnings that Mosul Dam could collapse. The United States warned people to evacuate the floodplain of the Tigris because between 500,000 and 1.5 million people were at risk of drowning due to flash flood if the dam collapses, and that the major Iraqi cities of Mosul, Tikrit, Samarra, and Baghdad were at risk.\nReligion and mythology.\nIn Sumerian mythology, the Tigris was created by the god Enki, who filled the river with flowing water.\nIn Hittite and Hurrian mythology, \"Aranzah\" (or \"Aranzahas\" in the Hittite nominative form) is the Hurrian name of the Tigris River, which was deified. He was the son of Kumarbi and the brother of Teshub and Ta\u0161mi\u0161u, one of the three gods spat out of Kumarbi's mouth onto Mount Kanzuras. Later he colluded with Anu and the Teshub to destroy Kumarbi (The Kumarbi Cycle).\nThe Tigris appears twice in the Old Testament. First, in the Book of Genesis, it is the third of the four rivers branching off the river issuing out of the Garden of Eden. The second mention is in the Book of Daniel, wherein Daniel states he received one of his visions \"when I was by that great river the Tigris\".\nThe Tigris River is also mentioned in Islam in Sunan Abi Daud 4306. The tomb of Imam Ahmad Bin Hanbal and Syed Abdul Razzaq Jilani is in Baghdad and the flow of Tigris restricts the number of visitors.\nBah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h, the founder of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, also wrote \"The Hidden Words\" around 1858 while he walked along the banks of the Tigris river during his exile in Baghdad.\nThe river featured on the coat of arms of Iraq from 1932 to 1959.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31260", "revid": "47822643", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31260", "title": "Titration", "text": "Laboratory method for determining the concentration of an analyte\nTitration (also known as titrimetry and volumetric analysis) is a common laboratory method of quantitative chemical analysis to determine the concentration of an identified analyte (a substance to be analyzed). A reagent, termed the \"titrant\" or \"titrator\", is prepared as a standard solution of known concentration and volume. The titrant reacts with a solution of \"analyte\" (which may also be termed the \"titrand\") to determine the analyte's concentration. The volume of titrant that reacted with the analyte is termed the \"titration volume\".\nHistory and etymology.\nThe word \"titration\" descends from the French word \"titrer\" (1543), meaning the proportion of gold or silver in coins or in works of gold or silver; i.e., a measure of fineness or purity. \"Tiltre\" became \"titre\", which thus came to mean the \"fineness of alloyed gold\", and then the \"concentration of a substance in a given sample\". In 1828, the French chemist Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac first used \"titre\" as a verb (\"titrer\"), meaning \"to determine the concentration of a substance in a given sample\".\nVolumetric analysis originated in late 18th-century France. French chemist Fran\u00e7ois-Antoine-Henri Descroizilles developed the first burette (which was similar to a graduated cylinder) in 1791. Gay-Lussac developed an improved version of the burette that included a side arm, and invented the terms \"pipette\" and \"burette\" in an 1824 paper on the standardization of indigo solutions. The first true burette was invented in 1845 by the French chemist \u00c9tienne-Ossian Henry (1798\u20131873). A major improvement of the method and popularization of volumetric analysis was due to Karl Friedrich Mohr, who redesigned the burette into a simple and convenient form, and who wrote the first textbook on the topic, \"Lehrbuch der chemisch-analytischen Titrirmethode\" (\"Textbook of analytical chemistry titration methods\"), published in 1855.\nProcedure.\nA typical titration begins with a beaker or Erlenmeyer flask containing a very precise amount of the analyte and a small amount of indicator (such as phenolphthalein) placed underneath a calibrated burette or chemistry pipetting syringe containing the titrant. Small volumes of the titrant are then added to the analyte and indicator until the indicator changes color in reaction to the titrant saturation threshold, representing arrival at the endpoint of the titration, meaning the amount of titrant balances the amount of analyte present, according to the reaction between the two. Depending on the endpoint desired, single drops or less than a single drop of the titrant can make the difference between a permanent and temporary change in the indicator. \nPreparation techniques.\nTypical titrations require titrant and analyte to be in a liquid (solution) form. Though solids are usually dissolved into an aqueous solution, other solvents such as glacial acetic acid or ethanol are used for special purposes (as in petrochemistry, which specializes in petroleum.) Concentrated analytes are often diluted to improve accuracy.\nMany non-acid\u2013base titrations require a constant pH during the reaction. Therefore, a buffer solution may be added to the titration chamber to maintain the pH.\nIn instances where two reactants in a sample may react with the titrant and only one is the desired analyte, a separate masking solution may be added to the reaction chamber which eliminates the effect of the unwanted ion.\nSome reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions may require heating the sample solution and titrating while the solution is still hot to increase the reaction rate. For instance, the oxidation of some oxalate solutions requires heating to to maintain a reasonable rate of reaction.\nTitration curves.\nA titration curve is a curve in the graph the \"x\"-coordinate of which represents the volume of titrant added since the beginning of the titration, and the \"y\"-coordinate of which represents the concentration of the analyte at the corresponding stage of the titration (in an acid\u2013base titration, the \"y\"-coordinate usually represents the pH of the solution).\nIn an acid\u2013base titration, the titration curve represents the strength of the corresponding acid and base. For a strong acid and a strong base, the curve will be relatively smooth and very steep near the equivalence point. Because of this, a small change in titrant volume near the equivalence point results in a large pH change, and many indicators would be appropriate (for instance litmus, phenolphthalein or bromothymol blue).\nIf one reagent is a weak acid or base and the other is a strong acid or base, the titration curve is irregular and the pH shifts less with small additions of titrant near the equivalence point. For example, the titration curve for the titration between oxalic acid (a weak acid) and sodium hydroxide (a strong base) is pictured. The equivalence point occurs between pH 8-10, indicating the solution is basic at the equivalence point and an indicator such as phenolphthalein would be appropriate. Titration curves corresponding to weak bases and strong acids are similarly behaved, with the solution being acidic at the equivalence point and indicators such as methyl orange and bromothymol blue being most appropriate.\nTitrations between a weak acid and a weak base have titration curves which are very irregular. Because of this, no definite indicator may be appropriate, and a pH meter is often used to monitor the reaction.\nThe type of function that can be used to describe the curve is termed a sigmoid function.\nTypes of titrations.\nThere are many types of titrations with different procedures and goals. The most common types of qualitative titration are acid\u2013base titrations and redox titrations.\nAcid\u2013base titration.\nAcid\u2013base titrations depend on the neutralization between an acid and a base when mixed in solution. In addition to the sample, an appropriate pH indicator is added to the titration chamber, representing the pH range of the equivalence point. The acid\u2013base indicator indicates the endpoint of the titration by changing color. The endpoint and the equivalence point are not exactly the same because the equivalence point is determined by the stoichiometry of the reaction while the endpoint is just the color change from the indicator. Thus, a careful selection of the indicator will reduce the indicator error. For example, if the equivalence point is at a pH of 8.4, then the phenolphthalein indicator would be used instead of Alizarin Yellow because phenolphthalein would reduce the indicator error. Common indicators, their colors, and the pH range in which they change color are given in the table above. When more precise results are required, or when the reagents are a weak acid and a weak base, a pH meter or a conductance meter are used.\nFor very strong bases, such as organolithium reagent, metal amides, and hydrides, water is generally not a suitable solvent and indicators whose pKa are in the range of aqueous pH changes are of little use. Instead, the titrant and indicator used are much weaker acids, and anhydrous solvents such as THF are used.\nThe approximate pH during titration can be approximated by three kinds of calculations. Before beginning of titration, the concentration of &lt;chem&gt;[H+]&lt;/chem&gt; is calculated in an aqueous solution of weak acid before adding any base. When the number of moles of bases added equals the number of moles of initial acid or so called equivalence point, one of hydrolysis and the pH is calculated in the same way that the conjugate bases of the acid titrated was calculated. Between starting and end points, &lt;chem&gt;[H+]&lt;/chem&gt; is obtained from the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and titration mixture is considered as buffer. In Henderson-Hasselbalch equation the [acid] and [base] are said to be the molarities that would have been present even with dissociation or hydrolysis. In a buffer, &lt;chem&gt;[H+]&lt;/chem&gt; can be calculated exactly but the dissociation of HA, the hydrolysis of &lt;chem&gt;A-&lt;/chem&gt; and self-ionization of water must be taken into account. Four independent equations must be used:\nformula_1\nformula_2\nformula_3\nformula_4\nIn the equations, formula_5 and formula_6 are the moles of acid (HA) and salt (XA where X is the cation), respectively, used in the buffer, and the volume of solution is V. The law of mass action is applied to the ionization of water and the dissociation of acid to derived the first and second equations. The mass balance is used in the third equation, where the sum of formula_7 and formula_8 must equal to the number of moles of dissolved acid and base, respectively. Charge balance is used in the fourth equation, where the left hand side represents the total charge of the cations and the right hand side represents the total charge of the anions: formula_9 is the molarity of the cation (e.g. sodium, if sodium salt of the acid or sodium hydroxide is used in making the buffer).\nRedox titration.\nRedox titrations are based on a reduction-oxidation reaction between an oxidizing agent and a reducing agent. A potentiometer or a redox indicator is usually used to determine the endpoint of the titration, as when one of the constituents is the oxidizing agent potassium dichromate. The color change of the solution from orange to green is not definite, therefore an indicator such as sodium diphenylamine is used. Analysis of wines for sulfur dioxide requires iodine as an oxidizing agent. In this case, starch is used as an indicator; a blue starch-iodine complex is formed in the presence of excess iodine, signalling the endpoint.\nSome redox titrations do not require an indicator, due to the intense color of the constituents. For instance, in permanganometry a slight persisting pink color signals the endpoint of the titration because of the color of the excess oxidizing agent potassium permanganate. In iodometry, at sufficiently large concentrations, the disappearance of the deep red-brown triiodide ion can itself be used as an endpoint, though at lower concentrations sensitivity is improved by adding starch indicator, which forms an intensely blue complex with triiodide.\nGas phase titration.\nGas phase titrations are titrations done in the gas phase, specifically as methods for determining reactive species by reaction with an excess of some other gas, acting as the titrant. In one common gas phase titration, gaseous ozone is titrated with nitrogen oxide according to the reaction\nO3 + NO \u2192 O2 + NO2.\nAfter the reaction is complete, the remaining titrant and product are quantified (e.g., by Fourier transform spectroscopy) (FT-IR); this is used to determine the amount of analyte in the original sample.\nGas phase titration has several advantages over simple spectrophotometry. First, the measurement does not depend on path length, because the same path length is used for the measurement of both the excess titrant and the product. Second, the measurement does not depend on a linear change in absorbance as a function of analyte concentration as defined by the Beer\u2013Lambert law. Third, it is useful for samples containing species which interfere at wavelengths typically used for the analyte.\nComplexometric titration.\nComplexometric titrations rely on the formation of a complex between the analyte and the titrant. In general, they require specialized complexometric indicators that form weak complexes with the analyte. The most common example is the use of starch indicator to increase the sensitivity of iodometric titration, the dark blue complex of starch with iodine and iodide being more visible than iodine alone. Other complexometric indicators are Eriochrome Black T for the titration of calcium and magnesium ions, and the chelating agent EDTA used to titrate metal ions in solution.\nZeta potential titration.\nZeta potential titrations are titrations in which the completion is monitored by the zeta potential, rather than by an indicator, in order to characterize heterogeneous systems, such as colloids. One of the uses is to determine the iso-electric point when surface charge becomes zero, achieved by changing the pH or adding surfactant. Another use is to determine the optimum dose for flocculation or stabilization.\nAssay.\nAn assay is a type of biological titration used to determine the concentration of a virus or bacterium. Serial dilutions are performed on a sample in a fixed ratio (such as 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, etc.) until the last dilution does not give a positive test for the presence of the virus. The positive or negative value may be determined by inspecting the infected cells visually under a microscope or by an immunoenzymetric method such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This value is known as the titer.\nMeasuring the endpoint of a titration.\nDifferent methods to determine the endpoint include:\nEndpoint and equivalence point.\nThough the terms equivalence point and endpoint are often used interchangeably, they are different terms. \"Equivalence point\" is the theoretical completion of the reaction: the volume of added titrant at which the number of moles of titrant is equal to the number of moles of analyte, or some multiple thereof (as in polyprotic acids). \"Endpoint\" is what is actually measured, a physical change in the solution as determined by an indicator or an instrument mentioned above.\nThere is a slight difference between the endpoint and the equivalence point of the titration. This error is referred to as an indicator error, and it is indeterminate.\nBack titration.\nBack titration is a titration done in reverse; instead of titrating the original sample, a known excess of standard reagent is added to the solution, and the excess is titrated. A back titration is useful if the endpoint of the reverse titration is easier to identify than the endpoint of the normal titration, as with precipitation reactions. Back titrations are also useful if the reaction between the analyte and the titrant is very slow, or when the analyte is in a non-soluble solid.\nGraphical methods.\nThe titration process creates solutions with compositions ranging from pure acid to pure base. Identifying the pH associated with any stage in the titration process is relatively simple for monoprotic acids and bases. The presence of more than one acid or base group complicates these computations.

The lyrics are from an early-19th-century English poem written by Jane Taylor, \"The Star\". The poem, which is in couplet form, was first published in 1806 in \"Rhymes for the Nursery\", a collection of poems by Taylor and her sister Ann. It is now sung to the tune of the French melody \"Ah! vous dirai-je, maman\", which was first published in 1761 and later arranged by several composers, including Mozart with Twelve Variations on \"Ah vous dirai-je, Maman\". The English lyrics have five stanzas, although only the first is widely known.\nWhere Jane Taylor was when she wrote the lyric is contested, with the localities of Colchester and Chipping Ongar each asserting a claim. However, Ann Taylor writes (in \"The Autobiography and Other Memorials of Mrs. Gilbert\") that the first time Jane ever saw the village of Ongar was in 1810, and the poem had been published in 1806. \"In the summer of 1810, Jane, when visiting London, had enjoyed a pic-nic excursion in Epping Forest, and observed on a sign post at one of the turnings, 'To Ongar.' It was the first time she had seen the name.\"\nLyrics.\nThe English lyrics were written as a poem by Jane Taylor (1783\u20131824) and published with the title \"The Star\" in \"Rhymes for the Nursery\" by Jane and her sister Ann Taylor (1782\u20131866) in London in 1806:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\nTwinkle, twinkle, little star,\nHow I wonder what you are!\nUp above the world so high,\nLike a diamond in the sky.\nWhen the blazing sun is gone,\nWhen he nothing shines upon,\nThen you show your little light,\nTwinkle, twinkle, all the night.\nThen the trav'ller in the dark,\nThanks you for your tiny spark,\nHe could not see which way to go,\nIf you did not twinkle so.\nIn the dark blue sky you keep,\nAnd often thro' my curtains peep,\nFor you never shut your eye,\nTill the sun is in the sky.\n'Tis your bright and tiny spark,\nLights the trav'ller in the dark:\nTho' I know not what you are,\nTwinkle, twinkle, little star.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe lyrics were first published with the tune \"Ah! vous dirai-je, maman\" in \"The Singing Master: First Class Tune Book\" in 1838.

{"id": "31268", "revid": "1318907869", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31268", "title": "TurboGrafx-16", "text": "Fourth-generation home video game console\nThe TurboGrafx-16, known as the outside North America, is a home video game console developed by Hudson Soft and manufactured by NEC. It was released in Japan in 1987 and in North America in 1989. The first console of the fourth generation, it launched in Japan to compete with Nintendo's Family Computer, but its delayed U.S. debut placed it against the more advanced Sega Genesis and later the Super NES.\nThe TurboGrafx-16 features an 8-bit CPU paired with dual 16-bit graphics processors, and supports up to 482 on-screen colors from a palette of 512. The \"16\" in the console\u2019s North American branding was criticized as misleading. With dimensions of , the PC Engine remains the smallest major home console ever released.\nGames were initially released on HuCard cartridges, but the platform later supported additional formats requiring separate hardware: TurboGrafx-CD (\"CD-ROM\u00b2\" in Japan) games on compact disc, SuperGrafx games on a new console variant, and LD-ROM\u00b2 games on LaserDisc via the LaserActive, a TurboGrafx-compatible system developed by Pioneer. No configuration supported all formats simultaneously. While the TurboGrafx-CD was moderately successful, the other two formats failed to gain traction. The resulting hardware fragmentation created consumer confusion.\nThe PC Engine was a commercial success in Japan, receiving strong third-party support and becoming the Super Famicom's main early competitor. In contrast, the TurboGrafx-16 struggled in North America due to limited marketing, a smaller game library, and its late release. In Europe, Japanese models were grey-market imported and modified for local sale, but plans for an official release were canceled following poor U.S. performance. Over 17 hardware variants were produced, including portable models and versions integrating the CD-ROM add-on. Production of the final model ended in 1994. It was succeeded by the PC-FX, released exclusively in Japan, which was a commercial failure.\nHistory.\nThe PC Engine was created as a collaborative effort between Hudson Soft, who created video game software, and NEC, a company which was dominant in the Japanese personal computer market with their PC-88 and PC-98 platforms. NEC lacked the vital experience in the video gaming industry and approached numerous video game studios for support. By pure coincidence, NEC's interest in entering the lucrative video game market coincided with Hudson's failed attempt to sell designs for then-advanced graphics chips to Nintendo; in July 1985, Hudson Soft approached and pitched them a new add-on for the Famicom that played games using their patented Bee Cards, which they had experimented with on the MSX computer. Nintendo liked this concept, as it had the ability to store full games and overwrite existing ones. However, due to the cost of the technology, and the fact that they would be required to pay royalties for each card sold, Nintendo ultimately decided to pass on Hudson Soft's proposal. This eventually led to the partnership between Hudson Soft and NEC. The two companies successfully teamed up to then develop the PC Engine.\nThe system made its debut in the Japanese market on October 30, 1987, and it was a tremendous success. The PC Engine had an elegant, \"eye-catching\" design, and it was very small compared to its rivals. The PC Engine sold 500,000 units in its first week of release.\nThe CD-ROM expansion was a major success for the CD-ROM format, selling 60,000 units in its first five months of release in Japan. By 1989, NEC had sold over 1.2 million consoles and more than 80,000 CD-ROM units in Japan.\nIn 1988, NEC decided to expand to the American market and directed its U.S. operations to develop the system for the new audience. NEC Technologies boss Keith Schaefer formed a team to test the system. They found out that there was a lack of enthusiasm in its name \"PC Engine\" and also felt its small size was not very suitable to American consumers who would generally prefer a larger and \"futuristic\" design. They decided to call the system the \"TurboGrafx-16\", a name representing its graphical speed and strength and its 16-bit GPU. They also completely redesigned the hardware into a large, black casing. This lengthy redesign process and NEC's questions about the system's viability in the United States delayed the TurboGrafx-16's debut.\nThe TurboGrafx-16 (branded as the TurboGrafx-16 Entertainment SuperSystem on the packaging and promotional material) was eventually released in the New York City and Los Angeles test markets in late August 1989. However, this was two weeks after Sega of America released the Sega Genesis with a 16-bit CPU to test markets. Unlike NEC, Sega did not waste time redesigning the original Japanese Mega Drive system, making only slight aesthetic changes.\nThe Genesis quickly eclipsed the TurboGrafx-16 after its American debut. NEC's decision to pack-in \"Keith Courage in Alpha Zones\", a Hudson Soft game unknown to western gamers, proved costly as Sega packed-in a port of the hit arcade title \"Altered Beast\" with the Genesis. NEC's American operations in Chicago were also overhyped about its potential and quickly produced 750,000 units, far above actual demand. This was very profitable for Hudson Soft as NEC paid Hudson Soft royalties for every console produced, whether sold or not. By 1990, it was clear that the system was performing very poorly and NEC could not compete with Nintendo and Sega's marketing.\nIn late 1989, NEC announced plans for a coin-op arcade video game version of the TurboGrafx-16. However, NEC cancelled the plans in early 1990.\nIn Europe, the console is known by its original Japanese name PC Engine, rather than its American name TurboGrafx-16. PC Engine imports from Japan drew a cult following, with a number of unauthorized PC Engine imports available along with NTSC-to-PAL adapters in the United Kingdom during the late 1980s. In 1989, a British company called Mention manufactured an adapted PAL version called the PC Engine Plus. However, the system was not officially supported by NEC. From November 1989 to 1993, PC Engine consoles as well as some add-ons were imported from Japan by French importer Sodipeng (\"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Distribution de la PC Engine\"), a subsidiary of Guillemot International. This came after considerable enthusiasm in the French press. The PC Engine was largely available in France and Benelux through major retailers. It came with French language instructions and also an AV cable to enable its compatibility with SECAM television sets.\nAfter seeing the TurboGrafx-16 falter in America, NEC decided to cancel their European releases. Units for the European markets were already produced, which were essentially US models modified to run on PAL television sets. NEC sold this stock to distributors; in the United Kingdom, Telegames released the console in 1990 in extremely limited quantities.\nBy March 1991, NEC claimed that it had sold 750,000 TurboGrafx-16 consoles in the United States and 500,000 CD-ROM units worldwide.\nIn an effort to relaunch the system in the North American market, in mid-1992 NEC and Hudson Soft transferred management of the system in North America to a new joint venture called Turbo Technologies and released the TurboDuo, an all-in-one unit that included the CD-ROM drive built in. However, the North American console gaming market continued to be dominated by the Genesis and Super NES, which was released in North America in August 1991. In May 1994, Turbo Technologies announced that it was dropping support for the Duo, though it would continue to offer repairs for existing units and provide ongoing software releases through independent companies in the U.S. and Canada.\nIn Japan, NEC had sold a total of 5.84 million PC Engine units as of 1995[ [update]] of which CD-ROM\u00b2 units and the Duo combied contributed 1.92 million as of \u00a01996[ [update]]. This adds up to a total of more than 6.59 million PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 units sold in Japan and the United States as of 1995[ [update]]. The final licensed release for the PC Engine was \"Dead of the Brain Part 1 &amp; 2\" on June 3, 1999, on the Super CD-ROM\u00b2 format.\nAdd-ons.\nTurboGrafx-CD/CD-ROM\u00b2.\nThe \"CD-ROM\u00b2\" is an add-on attachment for the PC Engine that was released in Japan on December 4, 1988. The add-on allows the core versions of the console to play PC Engine games in CD-ROM format in addition to standard HuCards. This made the PC Engine the first video game console to use CD-ROM as a storage media. The add-on consisted of two devices \u2013 the CD player itself and the interface unit, which connects the CD player to the console and provides a unified power supply and output for both. It was later released as the \"TurboGrafx-CD\" in the United States in November 1989, with a remodeled interface unit in order to suit the different shape of the TurboGrafx-16 console. The TurboGrafx-CD had a launch price of $399.99 and did not include any bundled games. \"Fighting Street\" and \"\" were the TurboGrafx-CD launch titles; \"Ys Book I &amp; II\" soon followed.\nSuper CD-ROM\u00b2.\nIn 1991, NEC introduced an upgraded version of the CD-ROM\u00b2 System known as the \"Super CD-ROM\u00b2\", which updates the BIOS to Version 3.0 and increases buffer RAM from 64 KB to 256 KB. This upgrade was released in several forms: the first was the \"PC Engine Duo\" on September 21, a new model of the console with a CD-ROM drive and upgraded BIOS/RAM already built into the system. This was followed by the \"Super System Card\" released on October 26, an upgrade for the existing CD-ROM\u00b2 add-on that serves as a replacement to the original System Card. PC Engine owners who did not already own the original CD-ROM\u00b2 add-on could instead opt for the Super-CD-ROM\u00b2 unit, an updated version of the add-on released on December 13, which combines the CD-ROM drive, interface unit and Super System Card into one device.\nArcade Card.\nOn March 12, 1994, NEC introduced a third upgrade known as the , which increases the amount of onboard RAM of the Super CD-ROM\u00b2 System to 2MB. This upgrade was released in two models: the \"Arcade Card Duo\", designed for PC Engine consoles already equipped with the Super CD-ROM\u00b2 System, and the \"Arcade Card Pro\", a model for the original CD-ROM\u00b2 System that combines the functionalities of the Super System Card and Arcade Card Duo into one. The first games for this add-on were ports of the Neo-Geo fighting games \"Fatal Fury 2\" and \"Art of Fighting\". Ports of \"World Heroes 2\" and \"Fatal Fury Special\" were later released for this card, along with several original games released under the \"Arcade CD-ROM\u00b2\" standard. By this point, support for both the TurboGrafx-16 and Turbo Duo was already waning in North America; thus, no North American version of either Arcade Card was produced, though a Japanese Arcade Card can still be used on a North American console through a HuCard converter.\nVariations.\nMany variations and related products of the PC Engine were released.\nCoreGrafx.\nThe \"PC Engine CoreGrafx\" is an updated model of the PC Engine, released in Japan on December 8, 1989. It has the same form factor as the original PC Engine, but it changes the color scheme from white and red to black and blue and replaces the original's radio frequency-output connector with a composite video AV port. It also used a revised CPU, the HuC6280A, which supposedly fixed some minor audio issues. A recolored version of the model, known as the \"PC Engine CoreGrafx II\", was released on June 21, 1991. Aside from the different coloring (light grey and orange), it is nearly identical to the original CoreGrafx except that the CPU was changed back to the original HuC6280.\nSuperGrafx.\nThe PC Engine SuperGrafx, released on the same day as the CoreGrafx in Japan, is an enhanced variation of the PC Engine hardware with updated specs. This model has a second HuC6270A (VDC), a HuC6202 (VDP) that combines the output of the two VDCs, four times as much RAM, twice as much video RAM, and a second layer/plane of scrolling. It also uses the revised HuC6280A CPU, but the sound and color palette were not upgraded, making the expensive price tag a big disadvantage to the system. As a result, only five exclusive SuperGrafx games and two hybrid games (\"Darius Plus\" and \"Darius Alpha\" were released as standard HuCards which took advantage of the extra video hardware if played on a SuperGrafx) were released, and the system was quickly discontinued. The SuperGrafx has the same expansion port as previous PC Engine consoles, but requires an adapter in order to utilize the original CD-ROM\u00b2 System add-on, due to the SuperGrafx console's large size.\nShuttle.\nThe \"PC Engine Shuttle\" was released in Japan on November 22, 1989, as a less expensive model of the console, retailing at \u00a518,800. It was targeted primarily towards younger players with its spaceship-like design and came bundled with a TurboPad II controller, which is shaped differently from the other standard TurboPad controllers. The reduced price was made possible by removing the expansion port from the back, making it the first model of the console that was not compatible with the CD-ROM\u00b2 add-on. However, it does have a slot for a memory backup unit, which is required for certain games. The RF output used on the original PC Engine was also replaced with an A/V port for the Shuttle.\nThe PC Engine Shuttle was also distributed in South Korea. It was released in 1990 by Daewoo Electronics.\nTurboExpress.\nThe TurboExpress, known as the PC Engine GT in Japan, is a portable version of the console released in December 1990. It can play HuCard games on a backlit, active-matrix color LCD screen, the most advanced on the market for a portable video game unit at the time. The screen contributed to its high price and short battery life, however, which hurt its performance in the market. It also has a TV tuner adapter as well as a two-player link cable.\nLT.\nThe \"PC Engine LT\" is a model of the console in a laptop form, released on December 13, 1991, in Japan, retailing at \u00a599,800. The LT does not require a television display (and does not have any AV output) as it has a built-in flip-up screen and speakers, just as a laptop would have, but, unlike the GT, the LT runs on a power supply. Its expensive price meant that few units were produced compared to other models. The LT has full expansion port capability, so the CD-ROM\u00b2 unit is compatible with the LT the same way as it is with the original PC Engine and CoreGrafx. However, the LT requires an adapter to use the enhanced Super CD-ROM\u00b2 unit. \nDuo.\nNEC Home Electronics released the \"PC Engine Duo\" in Japan on September 21, 1991, which combined the PC Engine and Super CD-ROM\u00b2 unit into a single console. The system can play HuCards, audio CDs, CD+Gs, standard CD-ROM\u00b2 games and Super CD-ROM\u00b2 games. The North American version, the \"TurboDuo\", was launched in October 1992.\nTwo updated variants were released in Japan: the \"PC Engine Duo-R\" on March 25, 1993, and the \"PC Engine Duo-RX\" on June 25, 1994. The changes were mostly cosmetic, but the RX included a new 6-button controller.\nThird-party models.\nThe \"PC-KD863G\" is a CRT monitor with built-in PC Engine console, released on September 27, 1988, in Japan for \u00a5138,000. Following NEC's PCs' naming scheme, the PC-KD863G was designed to eliminate the need to buy a separate television set and a console. It output its signals in RGB, so it was clearer at the time than the console which was still limited to RF and composite. However, it has no BUS expansion port, which made it incompatible with the CD-ROM\u00b2 System and memory backup add-ons.\nThe \"X1-Twin\" was the first licensed PC Engine-compatible hardware manufactured by a third-party company, released by Sharp in April 1989 for \u00a599,800. It is a hybrid system that can run PC Engine games and X1 computer software.\nPioneer Corporation's LaserActive supports an add-on module which allows the use of PC Engine games (HuCard, CD-ROM\u00b2 and Super CD-ROM\u00b2) as well as new \"LD-ROM\u00b2\" titles that work only on this device. NEC also released their own LaserActive unit (NEC PCE-LD1) and PC Engine add-on module, under an OEM license. A total of eleven LD-ROM2 titles were produced, with only three of them released in North America.\nOther foreign markets.\nOutside North America and Japan, the TurboGrafx-16 console was released in South Korea by a third-party company, Haitai, under the name \"Vistar 16\". It was based on the American version but with a new curved design. Daewoo Electronics distributed the PC Engine Shuttle in the South Korean market as well.\nTechnical specifications.\nThe TurboGrafx-16 uses a Hudson Soft HuC6280 CPU\u2014an 8-bit CPU running at 7.16 MHz paired with two 16-bit graphics processors, a HuC6270 video display controller and a HuC6260 video color encoder. It includes 8 KB of RAM, 64 KB of Video RAM, and the ability to display 482 colors at once from a 512-color palette. The sound hardware, built into the CPU, includes a programmable sound generator running at 3.58\u00a0MHz and a 5-10 bit stereo PCM.\nTurboGrafx-16 games use the HuCard ROM cartridge format, thin credit card-sized cards that insert into the front slot of the console. PC Engine HuCards have 38 connector pins. TurboGrafx-16 HuCards (alternatively referred to as \"TurboChips\") reverse eight of these pins as a region lockout method. The power switch on the console also acts as a lock that prevents HuCards from being removed while the system is powered on. The European release of the TurboGrafx-16 did not have its own PAL-formatted HuCards as a result of its limited release, with the system instead supporting standard HuCards and outputting a PAL 50\u00a0Hz video signal.\nPeripherals.\nIn Japan, the PC Engine was originally sold with a standard controller known simply as the Pad. It has a rectangular shape with a directional pad, two action buttons numbered \"I\" and \"II\", and two rubber \"Select\" and \"Run\" buttons, matching the number of buttons on the Famicom's primary controller (as well as a standard NES controller). Another controller known as the TurboPad was also launched separately with the console, which added two \"Turbo\" switches for the I and II buttons with three speed settings. The switches allow for a single button press to register multiple inputs at once (for instance, this allows for rapid fire in scrolling shooters). The TurboPad became standard-issue with the TurboGrafx-16 in North America, as well as subsequent models of the PC Engine in Japan starting with the PC Engine Coregrafx, immediately phasing out the original PC Engine Pad.\nAll PC Engine and TurboGrafx-16 consoles only have one controller port; in order to use multiple controllers on the same system and play multiplayer games, a separate peripheral, known in Japan as the MultiTap and in North America as the TurboTap, was required, which allowed up to five controllers to be plugged into the system. The Cordless Multitap was also available exclusively in Japan, sold as a set with a single Cordless Pad, with additional wireless controllers available separately.\nDue to using different diameter controller ports, PC Engine controllers and peripherals are not compatible with TurboGrafx-16 consoles and vice versa. The TurboDuo would revert to using the same controller port that the PC Engine uses, resulting in new TurboDuo-branded versions of the TurboPad and TurboTap peripherals, known as the DuoPad and the DuoTap respectively, to be made. An official TurboGrafx-16/Duo Adapter was also produced, which was an extension cable that allowed any TurboGrafx-16 controller or peripheral to be connected into the TurboDuo console (as well as any PC Engine console as a side effect).\nThe Virtual Cushion, released in 1992, allows players to feel the impact of enemy attacks through sound vibrations.\nMany peripherals were produced for both the TurboGrafx-16 and PC Engine. The TurboStick is a tabletop joystick designed to replicate the standard control layout of arcade games from the era. Other similar joystick controllers were produced by third-party manufacturers, such as the Python 4 by QuickShot and the Stick Engine by ASCII Corporation. The TurboBooster attached to the back of the system and allowed it to output composite video and stereo audio. Hudson released the Ten no Koe 2 in Japan, which enabled the ability to save progress in compatible HuCard titles. In 1991, NEC Avenue released the Avenue Pad 3, which added a third action button labelled \"III\" that could be assigned via a switch to function as either the Select or Run button, as many games had begun to use one of those for in-game commands. The Avenue Pad 6 was released in 1993 in conjunction with the PC Engine port of \"\", adding four action buttons numbered \"III\" through \"VI\"; unlike the three-button pad, these buttons did not duplicate existing buttons, and instead added new functionalities in compatible titles. Another six-button controller, the Arcade Pad 6, was released by NEC Home Electronics in 1994, replacing the TurboPad as the bundled controller of the PC Engine Duo-RX (the last model of the console).\nLibrary.\nA total of 678 commercial games were released for the TurboGrafx-16. In North America, the system featured \"Keith Courage in Alpha Zones\" as a pack-in game, a conversion of the PC Engine title Mashin Eiyuuden Wataru. The PC Engine console received strong third-party support in Japan, while the TurboGrafx-16 console struggled to gain the attention of other developers. Hudson brought over many of its popular franchises, such as \"Bomberman\", \"Bonk\", and \"Adventure Island\", to the system with graphically impressive follow-ups. Hudson also designed and published several original titles, such as \"Air Zonk\" and \"Dungeon Explorer\". Compile published \"Alien Crush\" and \"Devil's Crush\", two well-received virtual pinball games. Namco contributed several high-quality conversions of its arcade games, such as \"Valkyrie no Densetsu\", \"Pac-Land\", \"Galaga '88\", \"Final Lap Twin\", and \"Splatterhouse\", as did Capcom with a port of \"\".\nA large portion of the TurboGrafx-16's library is made up of horizontal and vertical-scrolling shooters. Examples include Konami's \"Gradius\" and \"Salamander\", Hudson's \"Super Star Soldier\" and \"Soldier Blade\", Namco's \"Galaga '88\", Irem's \"R-Type\", and Taito's \"Darius Alpha, Darius Plus\" and \"Super Darius\". The console is also known for its platformers and role-playing games; Victor Entertainment's \"The Legendary Axe\" won numerous awards and is seen among the TurboGrafx-16's definitive titles. \"Ys I &amp; II\", a compilation of two games from Nihon Falcom's \"Ys\" series, was particularly successful in Japan. \"Cosmic Fantasy 2\" was an RPG ported from Japan to the United States, which earned a \"Electronic Gaming Magazine\" RPG of the Year award in 1993.\nReception.\nIn Japan, the PC Engine was very successful, and at one point it was the top-selling console in the nation. In North America and Europe, the situation was reversed, with both Sega and Nintendo dominating the console market at the expense of NEC. Initially, the TurboGrafx-16 sold well in the U.S., but eventually, it suffered from a lack of support from third-party software developers and publishers.\nIn 1990, \"ACE\" magazine praised the console's racing game library, stating that, compared to \"all the popular consoles, the PC Engine is way out in front in terms of the range and quality of its race games.\" Reviewing the Turbo Duo model in 1993, \"GamePro\" gave it a \"thumbs down\". Though they praised the system's CD sound, graphics, and five-player capability, they criticized the outdated controller and the games library, saying the third-party support was \"almost nonexistent\" and that most of the first party games were localizations of games better suited to the Japanese market. In 2009, the TurboGrafx-16 was ranked the 13th greatest video game console of all time by \"IGN\", citing \"a solid catalog of games worth playing,\" but also a lack of third-party support and the absence of a second controller port.\nThe controversy over bit width marketing strategy reappeared with the advent of the Atari Jaguar console. Mattel did not market its 1979 Intellivision system with bit width, although it used a 16-bit CPU.\nLegacy.\nIn 1994, NEC released a new console, the Japanese-exclusive PC-FX, a 32-bit system with a tower-like design. It was a commercial failure, leading NEC to abandon the video game industry. \nEmulation programs for the TurboGrafx-16 exist for several modern and retro operating systems and architectures. Popular and regularly updated programs include Mednafen and BizHawk.\nIn 2006, a number of TurboGrafx-16 (TurboChip/HuCARD), TurboGrafx-CD (CD-ROM\u00b2) and Turbo Duo (Super CD-ROM\u00b2) games were released on Nintendo's Virtual Console download service for the Wii, and later the Wii U, and Nintendo 3DS, including several that were originally never released outside Japan. In 2011, ten TurboGrafx-16 games were released on the PlayStation Network for play on the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable in the North American region.\nIn 2010, Hudson released an iPhone application entitled \"TurboGrafx-16 GameBox\" which allowed users to buy and play a number of select Turbo Grafx games via in-app purchases.\nThe 2012 JRPG \"Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory\" features a character, known as Peashy, that pays homage to the console.\nIn 2016, rapper Kanye West's eighth solo album was initially announced to be titled \"Turbo Grafx 16\". The album, however, was eventually scrapped.\nIn 2019, Konami announced at E3 2019 and at Tokyo Game Show 2019 the TurboGrafx-16 Mini, a dedicated console featuring many built-in games. On March 6, 2020, Konami announced that the TurboGrafx-16 Mini and its peripheral accessories would be delayed indefinitely from its previous March 19, 2020 launch date due to the COVID-19 pandemic disrupting supply chains in China. It was released in North America on May 22, 2020, and released in Europe on June 5, 2020.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Jones has collaborated with filmmakers like John Boorman, Andrei Konchalovsky, Jim Henson, Alan Parker, Jim Sheridan, Barbet Schroeder and Michael Mann.\nJones has been nominated for three BAFTA Awards for Best Film Music - for \"Mississippi Burning\", \"The Last of the Mohicans\", and \"Brassed Off\". He has also been nominated for two Golden Globe Awards - Best Original Score and Best Original Song, and a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition for a Limited Series, Movie or Special for the miniseries \"Merlin\".\nJones has been a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Music in Britain since 2006. In 1999, he became the first chair of the music department of the National Film and Television School.\nEarly life and education.\nJones was born in Cape Town in 1949, one of three siblings born to a Cape Coloured family. His family were relocated to District Six following the passing of the Group Areas Act. Jones' family suffered from chronic poverty and substance abuse, and his mother was the sole breadwinner for their family.\nAt the age of six, Jones already had decided to become a film composer. At 10, he was accepted to the South African College of Music on a municipal bursary. In 1967, he attended the Royal Academy of Music in London with a scholarship and afterwards worked for five years for the BBC on reviews of radio and television music. In 1974, Jones attended the University of York from which he graduated with a master's degree in Film and Media Music. At the National Film and Television School Jones studied for three years on general film-making and film and sound techniques.\nDuring this time he wrote the music for twenty-two student projects. One of these films was the 1981's \"The Dollar Bottom,\" which won the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film.\nCareer.\nJones was soon after brought to the attention of John Boorman, who was in the midst of making his Arthurian epic, \"Excalibur\" (1981). Although mostly tracked with classical music by Richard Wagner and Carl Orff, Boorman also needed original dramatic cues (as well as period music) for certain scenes. Given \"Excalibur\"'s modest budget, a \"name\" composer was out of the question, so Boorman commissioned the up-and-coming young Jones.\n\"Excalibur\" brought Jones to the attention of Jim Henson, who was making \"The Dark Crystal\" (1982), and looking for a composer who was young and eager to work in the experimental, free-wheeling way which Henson preferred. The resultant score is an expansive, multi-faceted work, featuring the London Symphony Orchestra, augmented by inventive use of Fairlight and Synclavier synthesizers, as well as period instruments like crumhorn, recorder, and the unusual double-flageolet, which Jones came across by chance in a music store.\nJones followed \"Excalibur\" with scores for the horror films \"The Appointment\" (1981) and \"The Sender\" (1982), and the pirate adventure \"Savage Islands\" (1983). In 1985 Jones composed one of his best scores, for the acclaimed television production \"The Last Place on Earth\".\nJones reunited with Henson for the 1986 fantasy musical \"Labyrinth\". David Bowie wrote and performed the vocal tracks for this movie, including the hit \"Underground\", while Jones provided the dramatic score.\nReflecting that his complex, symphonic score for \"The Dark Crystal\" garnered little notice, Jones began to re-think his entire approach to dramatic scoring. Around the mid-80s, Jones' work became more electronic-based (much like fellow film composer Maurice Jarre), eschewing identifiable themes in favor of mood-enhancing synth chords and minimalist patterns. While he wrote a somber, chamber orchestra score in 1988 for \"Dominick and Eugene\" (which featured classical guitarist John Williams), scores like \"Angel Heart\" (1987), \"Mississippi Burning\" (1988) and \"Sea of Love\" (1989) are more typical of Jones' output during this period.\nJones' return to large-orchestra scoring came with 1990s \"Arachnophobia\", and he provided a light-hearted Georges Delerue-flavoured score for \"Blame it on the Bellboy\" in 1992.\nJones' most popular success came later in 1992 with his score for \"The Last of the Mohicans\", and his soaring, passionate music belies the difficulties which afflicted its creation. Director Michael Mann initially asked Jones to provide an electronic score for the film, but late in the game, it was decided an orchestral score would be more appropriate for this historic epic. Jones hurried to re-fashion the score for orchestra in the limited time left, while the constant re-cutting of the film meant music cues sometimes had to be rewritten several times to keep up with the new timings. Finally, with the release date looming, composer Randy Edelman was called in to score some minor scenes which Jones did not have time to do. Jones and Edelman received co-credit on the film (thus making this very popular and acclaimed score ineligible for Oscar consideration). Although all were displeased with the circumstances, Jones was not fired from the film despite reports to the contrary.\nJones became active in television in the 1990s, with orchestral scores for several Hallmark productions, including \"Gulliver's Travels\", \"Merlin\" and \"Cleopatra\". He also provided a fun, jazzy, 1930s-style score for \"Richard III\" (1995), which features a swing-band setting of Christopher Marlowe's \"The Passionate Shepherd to His Love\". In 1997 Jones worked for the first time with Ridley Scott, providing an electronic/orchestral/rock-flavoured soundtrack for \"G.I. Jane\" (1997).\nPersonal life.\nHe is married to Victoria Seale and has four children. His South-African born uncle, the actor Norman Florence, together with his aunt Rhoda Florence and his cousin Peter Florence, founded the Hay Festival in 1988, which Jones has attended almost every year since its inception.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The languages are known from manuscripts dating from the 5th to the 8th century AD, which were found in oasis cities on the northern edge of the Tarim Basin (now part of Xinjiang in Northwest China) and the Lop Desert. The discovery of these languages in the early 20th century contradicted the formerly prevalent idea of an east\u2013west division of the Indo-European language family as centum and satem languages, and prompted reinvigorated study of the Indo-European family. Scholars studying these manuscripts in the early 20th century identified their authors with the \"Tokharoi\", a name used in ancient sources for people of Bactria (Tokharistan). Although this identification is now believed to be mistaken, \"Tocharian\" remains the usual term for these languages.\nThe discovered manuscripts record two closely related languages, called Tocharian A (also \"East Tocharian\" or \"Turfanian\") and Tocharian B (\"West Tocharian\" or \"Kuchean\"). The subject matter of the texts suggests that Tocharian A was more archaic and used as a Buddhist liturgical language, while Tocharian B was more actively spoken in the entire area from Turfan in the east to Tumshuq in the west. A body of loanwords and names found in Prakrit documents from the Lop Nur basin have been dubbed Tocharian C (\"Kror\u00e4nian\"). A claimed find of ten Tocharian C texts written in Kharosthi has been discredited.\nThe oldest extant manuscripts in Tocharian B are now dated to the fifth or even late fourth century AD, making it a language of late antiquity contemporary with Gothic, Classical Armenian, and Primitive Irish.\nDiscovery and significance.\nAfanasievo&lt;br&gt;culture\nTocharians\nIndo-Aryans\nIndo-European migrations, with location of the Afanasievo culture (genetically identical to the Yamnaya culture of the Pontic steppes) and their probable Tocharian descendants\nThe existence of the Tocharian languages and alphabet was not even suspected until archaeological exploration of the Tarim Basin by Aurel Stein in the early 20th century brought to light fragments of manuscripts in an unknown language, dating from the 6th to 8th centuries AD.\nIt soon became clear that these fragments were actually written in two distinct but related languages belonging to a hitherto unknown branch of Indo-European, now known as Tocharian:\nPrakrit documents from 3rd-century Kror\u00e4n and Niya on the southeast edge of the Tarim Basin contain loanwords and names that appeared to scholars to come from a closely related language, referred to as Tocharian C. However, this was found to be entirely flawed for the Kror\u00e4n part (see below, section \"Tocharian C\"). Recently, a dissertation authored by Niels Schoubben (Leiden University) has demonstrated that all the so-called Tocharian loanwords in Niya Prakrit were, in fact, Bactrian and pre-Bactrian loanwords, or resulted from fundamental misunderstandings of specific words and orthographies. His work definitively put an end to the \"Tocharian C\" hypothesis.\nThe discovery of Tocharian upset some theories about the relations of Indo-European languages and revitalized their study. In the 19th century, it was thought that the division between centum and satem languages was a simple west\u2013east division, with centum languages in the west. The theory was undermined in the early 20th century by the discovery of Hittite, a centum language in a relatively eastern location, and Tocharian, which was a centum language despite being the easternmost branch. The result was a new hypothesis, following the wave model of Johannes Schmidt, suggesting that the satem isogloss represents a linguistic innovation in the central part of the Proto-Indo-European home range, and the centum languages along the eastern and the western peripheries did not undergo that change.\nMost scholars identify the ancestors of the Tocharians with the Afanasievo culture of South Siberia (c. 3300\u20132500 BC), an early eastern offshoot of the steppe cultures of the Don-Volga area that later became the Yamnayans. Under this scenario, Tocharian speakers would have immigrated to the Tarim Basin from the north at some later point.\nMost scholars reject Walter Bruno Henning's proposed link to Gutian, a language spoken on the Iranian plateau in the 22nd century BC and known only from personal names.\nTocharian probably died out after 840 when the Uyghurs, expelled from Mongolia by the Kyrgyz, moved into the Tarim Basin. The theory is supported by the discovery of translations of Tocharian texts into Uyghur.\nSome modern Chinese words may ultimately derive from a Tocharian or related source, e.g. Old Chinese () \"honey\", from Proto-Tocharian *\"\u1e3f\u0259t(\u0259)\" (where *\"\u1e3f\" is palatalized; cf. Tocharian B ), cognate with Old Church Slavonic (transliterated: ) (meaning \"honey\"), and English \"mead\".\nNames.\nA colophon to a Central Asian Buddhist manuscript from the late 8th century states that it was translated into Old Turkic from Sanskrit, via a \"tw\u03b3ry\" language. In 1907, Emil Sieg and Friedrich W. K. M\u00fcller proposed that \"tw\u03b3ry\" was a name for the newly-discovered language of the Turpan area.\nSieg and M\u00fcller, reading this name as \"toxr\u00ef\", connected it with the ethnonym \"T\u00f3charoi\" (, Ptolemy VI, 11, 6, 2nd century AD), itself taken from Indo-Iranian (cf. Old Persian \"tux\u0101ri-\", Khotanese \"ttahv\u0101ra\", and Sanskrit \"tukh\u0101ra\"), and proposed the name \"Tocharian\" (German \"Tocharisch\"). Ptolemy's \"T\u00f3charoi\" are often associated by modern scholars with the Yuezhi of Chinese historical accounts, who founded the Kushan Empire. It is now clear that these people actually spoke Bactrian, an Eastern Iranian language, rather than the language of the Tarim manuscripts, so the term \"Tocharian\" is considered a misnomer. Nevertheless, it remains the standard term for the language of the Tarim Basin manuscripts.\nIn 1938, Walter Bruno Henning found the term \"four \"tw\u03b3ry\"\" used in early 9th-century manuscripts in Sogdian, Middle Iranian, and Uighur. He argued that it referred to the region on the northeast edge of the Tarim, including Agni and Karakhoja, but not Kucha. He thus inferred that the colophon referred to the Agnean language.\nAlthough the term \"tw\u03b3ry\" or \"toxr\u00ef\" appears to be the Old Turkic name for the Tocharians, it is not found in Tocharian texts.\nThe apparent self-designation appears in Tocharian A texts. Tocharian B texts use the adjective , derived from or , a name also known from Chinese and Turkic documents. The historian Bernard Sergent compounded these names to coin an alternative term \"Ar\u015bi-Ku\u010di\" for the family, recently revised to \"Agni-Ku\u010di\", but this name has not achieved widespread usage.\nWriting system.\nTocharian is documented in manuscript fragments, mostly from the 8th century (with a few earlier ones) that were written on palm leaves, wooden tablets, and Chinese paper, preserved by the extremely dry climate of the Tarim Basin. Samples of the language have been discovered at sites in Kucha and Karasahr, including many mural inscriptions.\nMost of attested Tocharian was written in the Tocharian alphabet, a derivative of the Brahmi alphabetic syllabary (abugida) also referred to as North Turkestan Brahmi or slanting Brahmi. However a smaller amount was written in the Manichaean script in which Manichaean texts were recorded. It soon became apparent that a large proportion of the manuscripts were translations of known Buddhist works in Sanskrit and some of them were even bilingual, facilitating decipherment of the new language. Besides the Buddhist and Manichaean religious texts, there were also monastery correspondence and accounts, commercial documents, caravan permits, medical and magical texts, and one love poem.\nIn 1998, the Chinese linguist Ji Xianlin published a translation and analysis of fragments of a Tocharian \"Maitreyasamiti-Nataka\" discovered in 1974 in Yanqi.\nTocharian A and B.\nTocharian A and B are significantly different, to the point of being mutually unintelligible. A common Proto-Tocharian language must precede the attested languages by several centuries, probably dating to the late 1st millennium BC.\nTocharian A is found only in the eastern part of the Tocharian-speaking area, and all extant texts are of a religious nature. Tocharian B, however, is found throughout the range and in both religious and secular texts. As a result, it has been suggested that Tocharian A was a liturgical language, no longer spoken natively, while Tocharian B was the spoken language of the entire area.\nThe hypothesized relationship of Tocharian A and B as liturgical and spoken forms, respectively, is sometimes compared with the relationship between Latin and the modern Romance languages, or Classical Chinese and Mandarin. However, in both of these latter cases, the liturgical language is the linguistic ancestor of the spoken language, whereas no such relationship holds between Tocharian A and B. In fact, from a phonological perspective Tocharian B is significantly more conservative than Tocharian A, and serves as the primary source for reconstructing Proto-Tocharian. Only Tocharian B preserves the following Proto-Tocharian features: stress distinctions, final vowels, diphthongs, and \"o\" vs. \"e\" distinction. In turn, the loss of final vowels in Tocharian A has led to the loss of certain Proto-Tocharian categories still found in Tocharian B, e.g. the vocative case and some of the noun, verb, and adjective declensional classes.\nIn their declensional and conjugational endings, the two languages innovated in divergent ways, with neither clearly simpler than the other. For example, both languages show significant innovations in the present active indicative endings but in radically different ways, so that only the second-person singular ending is directly cognate between the two languages, and in most cases neither variant is directly cognate with the corresponding Proto-Indo-European (PIE) form. The agglutinative secondary case endings in the two languages likewise stem from different sources, showing parallel development of the secondary case system after the Proto-Tocharian period. Likewise, some of the verb classes show independent origins, e.g. the class II preterite, which uses reduplication in Tocharian A (possibly from the reduplicated aorist) but long PIE \"\u0113\" in Tocharian B (possibly related to the long-vowel perfect found in Latin \"l\u0113g\u012b\", \"f\u0113c\u012b\", etc.).\nTocharian B shows an internal chronological development; three linguistic stages have been detected. The oldest stage is attested only in Kucha. There are also the middle (\"classical\") and the late stage.\nTocharian C.\nA third Tocharian language was first suggested by Thomas Burrow in the 1930s, while discussing 3rd-century documents from Kror\u00e4n (Loulan) and Niya. The texts were written in Gandhari Prakrit, but contained loanwords of evidently Tocharian origin, such as \"kilme\" ('district'), \"\u1e63o\u1e63tha\u1e43ga\" ('tax collector'), and \"\u1e63ilpoga\" ('document'). This hypothetical language later became generally known as Tocharian C. It has also sometimes been called Kror\u00e4nian or Krorainic.\nIn papers published posthumously in 2018, Klaus T. Schmidt, a scholar of Tocharian, presented a decipherment of 10 texts written in the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b script. Schmidt claimed that these texts were written in a third Tocharian language he called . He also suggested that the language was closer to Tocharian B than to Tocharian A. In 2019 a group of linguists led by Georges-Jean Pinault and Micha\u00ebl Peyrot convened in Leiden to examine Schmidt's translations against the original texts. They concluded that Schmidt's decipherment was fundamentally flawed, that there was no reason to associate the texts with Kr\u00f6r\u00e4n, and that the language they recorded was neither Tocharian nor Indic, but Iranian.\nIn 2024, Schoubben conducted a systematic review of Niya Prakrit and the loanwords claimed as evidence for Tocharian C. He argued that most of the words in question could be explained as loanwords from Bactrian or other Iranian languages, and found no compelling evidence for a Tocharian substrate. For example, Burrow proposed that \"a\u1e43klatsa\", 'a type of camel', corresponded to Tocharian A \"\u0101knats\" and Tocharian B \"akn\u0101tsa\" 'stupid, foolish', believing that this would refer to an 'untrained camel', from a Tocharian form *\"anknats\" (with the negative prefix *\"en-\"). Not only does this etymology presuppose an \"ad hoc\" sound change from *-\"nkn\"- to *-\"nkl\"-, but the variant \"agiltsa\" also found in Niya becomes aberrant. Schoubben suggests that this might be a Bactrian word, as camels originally come from Bactria, but could not find a convincing etymology. He had earlier argued that &lt;\u1e31&gt; was used in Niya Prakrit to transcribe Bactrian -\"\u0161k\"- (spelled \u03f8\u03ba in the Bactrian alphabet). For example, Burrow had tentatively connected \"ma\u1e31a\", a Niya Prakrit word for an unidentified food produced on farms, with Tocharian A \"malke\" 'milk', but Schoubben derives it from Proto-Iranian *\"m\u0101\u0161aka-\" 'bean'.\nPhonology.\nPhonetically, Tocharian languages are \"centum\" Indo-European languages, meaning that they merge the palatovelar consonants () of Proto-Indo-European with the plain velars () rather than palatalizing them to affricates or sibilants. Centum languages are mostly found in western and southern Europe (Greek, Italic, Celtic, Germanic). In that sense Tocharian (to some extent like the Greek and the Anatolian languages) seems to have been an isolate in the \"satem\" (i.e. palatovelar to sibilant) phonetic regions of Indo-European-speaking populations. The discovery of Tocharian contributed to doubts that Proto-Indo-European had originally split into western and eastern branches; today, the centum\u2013satem division is not seen as a real familial division.\nVowels.\nTocharian A and Tocharian B have the same set of vowels, but they often do not correspond to each other. For example, the sound \"a\" did not occur in Proto-Tocharian. Tocharian B \"a\" is derived from former stressed \"\u00e4\" or unstressed \"\u0101\" (reflected unchanged in Tocharian A), while Tocharian A \"a\" stems from Proto-Tocharian or (reflected as and in Tocharian B), and Tocharian A \"e\" and \"o\" stem largely from monophthongization of former diphthongs (still present in Tocharian B).\nDiphthongs.\nDiphthongs occur in Tocharian B only.\nConsonants.\nThe following table lists the reconstructed phonemes in Tocharian along with their standard transcription. Because Tocharian is written in an alphabet used originally for Sanskrit and its descendants, the transcription reflects Sanskrit phonology, and may not represent Tocharian phonology accurately. The Tocharian alphabet also has letters representing all of the remaining Sanskrit sounds, but these appear only in Sanskrit loanwords and are not thought to have had distinct pronunciations in Tocharian. There is some uncertainty as to actual pronunciation of some of the letters, particularly those representing palatalized obstruents (see below).\nMorphology.\nNouns.\nTocharian has completely re-worked the nominal declension system of Proto-Indo-European. The only cases inherited from the proto-language are nominative, genitive, accusative, and (in Tocharian B only) vocative; in Tocharian the old accusative is known as the \"oblique\" case. In addition to these primary cases, however, each Tocharian language has six cases formed by the addition of an invariant suffix to the oblique case \u2014 although the set of six cases is not the same in each language, and the suffixes are largely non-cognate. For example, the Tocharian word ' (Toch B), ' (Toch A) \"horse\" &lt; PIE \"*e\u1e31wos\" is declined as follows:\nThe Tocharian A instrumental case rarely occurs with humans.\nWhen referring to humans, the oblique singular of most adjectives and of some nouns is marked in both varieties by an ending \"-(a)\u1e43\", which also appears in the secondary cases. An example is ' (Toch B), ' (Toch A) \"man\", which belongs to the same declension as above, but has oblique singular ' (Toch B), ' (Toch A), and corresponding oblique stems ' (Toch B), ' (Toch A) for the secondary cases. This is thought to stem from the generalization of \"n\"-stem adjectives as an indication of determinative semantics, seen most prominently in the weak adjective declension in the Germanic languages (where it cooccurs with definite articles and determiners), but also in Latin and Greek \"n\"-stem nouns (especially proper names) formed from adjectives, e.g. Latin \"Cat\u014d\" (genitive \"Cat\u014dnis\") literally \"the sly one\" &lt; \"catus\" \"sly\", Greek \"Pl\u00e1t\u014dn\" literally \"the broad-shouldered one\" &lt; \"plat\u00fas\" \"broad\".\nVerbs.\nIn contrast, the verbal conjugation system is quite conservative. The majority of Proto-Indo-European verbal classes and categories are represented in some manner in Tocharian, although not necessarily with the same function. Some examples: athematic and thematic present tenses, including null-, \"-y-\", \"-s\u1e31-\", \"-s-\", \"-n-\" and \"-nH-\" suffixes as well as \"n\"-infixes and various laryngeal-ending stems; \"o\"-grade and possibly lengthened-grade perfects (although lacking reduplication or augment); sigmatic, reduplicated, thematic, and possibly lengthened-grade aorists; optatives; imperatives; and possibly PIE subjunctives.\nIn addition, most PIE sets of endings are found in some form in Tocharian (although with significant innovations), including thematic and athematic endings, primary (non-past) and secondary (past) endings, active and mediopassive endings, and perfect endings. Dual endings are still found, although they are rarely attested and generally restricted to the third person. The mediopassive still reflects the distinction between primary \"-r\" and secondary \"-i\", effaced in most Indo-European languages. Both root and suffix ablaut is still well-represented, although again with significant innovations.\nCategories.\nTocharian verbs are conjugated in the following categories:\nClasses.\nA given verb belongs to one of a large number of classes, according to its conjugation. As in Sanskrit, Ancient Greek, and (to a lesser extent) Latin, there are independent sets of classes in the indicative present, subjunctive, perfect, imperative, and to a limited extent optative and imperfect, and there is no general correspondence among the different sets of classes, meaning that each verb must be specified using a number of principal parts.\nPresent indicative.\nThe most complex system is the present indicative, consisting of 12 classes, 8 thematic and 4 athematic, with distinct sets of thematic and athematic endings. The following classes occur in Tocharian B (some are missing in Tocharian A):\nPalatalization of the final root consonant occurs in the 2nd singular, 3rd singular, 3rd dual and 2nd plural in thematic classes II and VIII-XII as a result of the original PIE thematic vowel \"e\".\nSubjunctive.\nThe subjunctive likewise has 12 classes, denoted \"i\" through \"xii\". Most are conjugated identically to the corresponding indicative classes; indicative and subjunctive are distinguished by the fact that a verb in a given indicative class will usually belong to a different subjunctive class.\nIn addition, four subjunctive classes differ from the corresponding indicative classes, two \"special subjunctive\" classes with differing suffixes and two \"varying subjunctive\" classes with root ablaut reflecting the PIE perfect.\nSpecial subjunctives:\nVarying subjunctives:\nPreterite.\nThe preterite has 6 classes:\nAll except preterite class VI have a common set of endings that stem from the PIE perfect endings, although with significant innovations.\nImperative.\nThe imperative likewise shows 6 classes, with a unique set of endings, found only in the second person, and a prefix beginning with \"p-\". This prefix usually reflects Proto-Tocharian \"*p\u00e4-\" but unexpected connecting vowels occasionally occur, and the prefix combines with vowel-initial and glide-initial roots in unexpected ways. The prefix is often compared with the Slavic perfective prefix \"po-\", although the phonology is difficult to explain.\nClasses i through v tend to co-occur with preterite classes I through V, although there are many exceptions. Class vi is not so much a coherent class as an \"irregular\" class with all verbs not fitting in other categories. The imperative classes tend to share the same suffix as the corresponding preterite (if any), but to have root vocalism that matches the vocalism of a verb's subjunctive. This includes the root ablaut of subjunctive classes i and v, which tend to co-occur with imperative class i.\nOptative and imperfect.\nThe optative and imperfect have related formations. The optative is generally built by adding \"i\" onto the subjunctive stem. Tocharian B likewise forms the imperfect by adding \"i\" onto the present indicative stem, while Tocharian A has 4 separate imperfect formations: usually \"\u0101\" is added to the subjunctive stem, but occasionally to the indicative stem, and sometimes either \"\u0101\" or \"s\" is added directly onto the root. The endings differ between the two languages: Tocharian A uses present endings for the optative and preterite endings for the imperfect, while Tocharian B uses the same endings for both, which are a combination of preterite and unique endings (the latter used in the singular active).\nEndings.\nAs suggested by the above discussion, there are a large number of sets of endings. The present-tense endings come in both thematic and athematic variants, although they are related, with the thematic endings generally reflecting a theme vowel (PIE \"e\" or \"o\") plus the athematic endings. There are different sets for the preterite classes I through V; preterite class VI; the imperative; and in Tocharian B, in the singular active of the optative and imperfect. Furthermore, each set of endings comes with both active and mediopassive forms. The mediopassive forms are quite conservative, directly reflecting the PIE variation between \"-r\" in the present and \"-i\" in the past. (Most other languages with the mediopassive have generalized one of the two.)\nThe present-tense endings are almost completely divergent between Tocharian A and B. The following shows the thematic endings, with their origin:\nComparison to other Indo-European languages.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn traditional Indo-European studies, no hypothesis of a closer genealogical relationship of the Tocharian languages has been widely accepted by linguists. However, lexicostatistical and glottochronological approaches suggest the Anatolian languages, including Hittite, might be the closest relatives of Tocharian.\nAs an example, the same Proto-Indo-European root (but not a common suffixed formation) can be reconstructed to underlie the words for 'wheel': Tocharian A , Tokharian B , and Hittite .\nContact with other languages.\nMicha\u00ebl Peyrot argues that several of the most striking typological peculiarities of Tocharian are rooted in a prolonged contact of Proto-Tocharian with an early stage of Proto-Samoyedic in South Siberia. This might explain the merger of all three stop series (e.g. *t, *d, *d\u02b0 &gt; *t), which must have led to a huge number of homonyms, restructuring of the vowel system, development of agglutinative case marking, the loss of the dative case, and others.\nIn historic times, the Tocharian language stood in contact with various surrounding languages, including Iranian, Turkic, and Sinitic languages. Tocharian borrowings, and other Indo-European loanwords transmitted to Uralic, Turkic and Sinitic speakers, have been confirmed. Tocharian had a high social position within the region, and influenced the Turkic languages, which would later replace Tocharian in the Tarim Basin.\nNotable example.\nMost of the texts known from the Tocharians are religious, but one noted text is a fragment of a love poem in Tocharian B (manuscript B-496, found in Kizil):\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31274", "revid": "41346365", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31274", "title": "Trie", "text": "Search tree data structure\nIn computer science, a trie (, ), also known as a digital tree or prefix tree, is a specialized search tree data structure used to store and retrieve strings from a dictionary or set. Unlike a binary search tree, nodes in a trie do not store their associated key. Instead, each node's \"position\" within the trie determines its associated key, with the connections between nodes defined by individual characters rather than the entire key.\nTries are particularly effective for tasks such as autocomplete, spell checking, and IP routing, offering advantages over hash tables due to their prefix-based organization and lack of hash collisions. Every child node shares a common prefix with its parent node, and the root node represents the empty string. While basic trie implementations can be memory-intensive, various optimization techniques such as compression and bitwise representations have been developed to improve their efficiency. A notable optimization is the radix tree, which provides more efficient prefix-based storage.\nWhile tries commonly store character strings, they can be adapted to work with any ordered sequence of elements, such as permutations of digits or shapes. A notable variant is the bitwise trie, which uses individual bits from fixed-length binary data (such as integers or memory addresses) as keys.\nHistory, etymology, and pronunciation.\nThe idea of a trie for representing a set of strings was first abstractly described by Axel Thue in 1912. Tries were first described in a computer context by Ren\u00e9 de la Briandais in 1959.336\nThe idea was independently described in 1960 by Edward Fredkin, who coined the term \"trie\", pronouncing it (as \"tree\"), after the middle syllable of \"retrieval\". However, other authors pronounce it (as \"try\"), in an attempt to distinguish it verbally from \"tree\".\nOverview.\nTries are a form of string-indexed look-up data structure, which is used to store a dictionary list of words that can be searched on in a manner that allows for efficient generation of completion lists.1 A prefix trie is an ordered tree data structure used in the representation of a set of strings over a finite alphabet set, which allows efficient storage of words with common prefixes.\nTries can be efficacious on string-searching algorithms such as predictive text, approximate string matching, and spell checking in comparison to binary search trees.358 A trie can be seen as a tree-shaped deterministic finite automaton.\nOperations.\nTries support various operations: insertion, deletion, and lookup of a string key. Tries are composed of nodes that contain links, which either point to other suffix child nodes or \"null\". As for every tree, each node but the root is pointed to by only one other node, called its \"parent\". Each node contains as many links as the number of characters in the applicable alphabet (although tries tend to have a substantial number of null links). In some cases, the alphabet used is simply that of the character encoding\u2014resulting in, for example, a size of 128 in the case of ASCII.732\nThe null links within the children of a node emphasize the following characteristics:734336\nA basic structure type of nodes in the trie is as follows; formula_1 may contain an optional formula_2, which is associated with the key that corresponds to the node.\nSearching.\nSearching for a value in a trie is guided by the characters in the search string key, as each node in the trie contains a corresponding link to each possible character in the given string. Thus, following the string within the trie yields the associated value for the given string key. A null link during the search indicates the inexistence of the key.732-733\nThe following pseudocode implements the search procedure for a given string key in a rooted trie x.135\nIn the above pseudocode, x and key correspond to the pointer of trie's root node and the string key respectively. The search operation takes formula_3 time, where formula_4 is the size of the string parameter key. In a balanced binary search tree, on the other hand, it takes formula_5 time, in the worst case, since key needs to be compared with formula_6 other keys and each comparison takes formula_3 time, in the worst case.358\nThe trie occupies less space, in comparison with a binary search tree, in the case of a large number of short strings, since nodes share common initial string subsequences and store the keys implicitly.358\nOne unique characteristic of trie - its structure does not depend on the insertion or deletion order of the keys, unlike binary search trees. \nInsertion.\nInsertion into trie is guided by using the character sets as indexes to the children array until the last character of the string key is reached.733-734 Each node in the trie corresponds to one call of the radix sorting routine, as the trie structure reflects the execution of pattern of the top-down radix sort.135\nIf null links are encountered prior to reaching the last character of the string key, new nodes are created.745 The input value is assigned to the value of the last node traversed, which is the node that corresponds to the key.\nDeletion.\nDeletion of a key\u2013value pair from a trie involves finding the node corresponding to the key, setting its value to null, and recursively removing nodes that have no children.740\nThe procedure begins by examining key; an empty string indicates arrival at the node corresponding to the (original) key, in which case its value is set to null. If the node, then, has null value and no children, it is removed from the trie by returning null; otherwise the node is kept by returning the node itself.\nReplacing other data structures.\nReplacement for hash tables.\nA trie can be used to replace a hash table, over which it has the following advantages:358\nHowever, tries are less efficient than a hash table when the data is directly accessed on a secondary storage device such as a hard disk drive that has higher random access time than the main memory.\nImplementation strategies.\nTries can be represented in several ways, corresponding to different trade-offs between memory use and speed of the operations.341 Using a vector of pointers for representing a trie consumes enormous space; however, memory space can be reduced at the expense of running time if a singly linked list is used for each node vector, as most entries of the vector contains formula_12.495\nTechniques such as \"alphabet reduction\" may reduce the large space requirements by reinterpreting the original string as a longer string over a smaller alphabet. For example, a string of n bytes can alternatively be regarded as a string of 2\"n\" four-bit units. This can reduce memory usage by a factor of eight; but lookups need to visit twice as many nodes in the worst case.347\u2013352 Another technique includes storing a vector of 256 ASCII pointers as a bitmap of 256 bits representing ASCII alphabet, which reduces the size of individual nodes dramatically.\nBitwise tries.\nBitwise tries are used to address the enormous space requirement for the trie nodes in a naive simple pointer vector implementations. Each character in the string key set is represented via individual bits, which are used to traverse the trie over a string key. The implementations for these types of trie use vectorized CPU instructions to find the first set bit in a fixed-length key input (e.g. GCC's codice_1 intrinsic function). Accordingly, the set bit is used to index the first item, or child node, in the 32- or 64-entry based bitwise tree. Search then proceeds by testing each subsequent bit in the key.\nThis procedure is also cache-local and highly parallelizable due to register independency, and thus performant on out-of-order execution CPUs.\nCompressed tries.\nRadix tree, also known as a compressed trie, is a space-optimized variant of a trie in which any node with only one child gets merged with its parent; elimination of branches of the nodes with a single child results in better metrics in both space and time.452 This works best when the trie remains static and set of keys stored are very sparse within their representation space.3\u201316\nOne more approach for static tries is to \"pack\" the trie by storing disjoint sets of children in the same memory location, interleaved.\nPatricia trees.\nPatricia trees are a particular implementation of the compressed binary trie that uses the binary encoding of the string keys in its representation.140 Every node in a Patricia tree contains an index, known as a \"skip number\", that stores the node's branching index to avoid empty subtrees during traversal.140-141 A naive implementation of a trie consumes immense storage due to larger number of leaf-nodes caused by sparse distribution of keys; Patricia trees can be efficient for such cases.1423\nA representation of a Patricia tree is shown to the right. Each index value adjacent to the nodes represents the \"skip number\"\u2014the index of the bit with which branching is to be decided.3 The skip number 1 at node 0 corresponds to the position 1 in the binary encoded ASCII where the leftmost bit differed in the key set X.3-4 The skip number is crucial for search, insertion, and deletion of nodes in the Patricia tree, and a bit masking operation is performed during every iteration.143\nApplications.\nTrie data structures are commonly used in predictive text or autocomplete dictionaries, and approximate matching algorithms. Tries enable faster searches, occupy less space, especially when the set contains large number of short strings, thus used in spell checking, hyphenation applications and longest prefix match algorithms.358 However, if storing dictionary words is all that is required (i.e. there is no need to store metadata associated with each word), a minimal deterministic acyclic finite state automaton (DAFSA) or radix tree would use less storage space than a trie. This is because DAFSAs and radix trees can compress identical branches from the trie which correspond to the same suffixes (or parts) of different words being stored. String dictionaries are also utilized in natural language processing, such as finding lexicon of a text corpus.73\nSorting.\nLexicographic sorting of a set of string keys can be implemented by building a trie for the given keys and traversing the tree in pre-order fashion; this is also a form of radix sort. Tries are also fundamental data structures for burstsort, which is notable for being the fastest string sorting algorithm as of 2007, accomplished by its efficient use of CPU cache.\nFull-text search.\nA special kind of trie, called a suffix tree, can be used to index all suffixes in a text to carry out fast full-text searches.\nWeb search engines.\nA specialized kind of trie called a compressed trie, is used in web search engines for storing the indexes - a collection of all searchable words. Each terminal node is associated with a list of URLs\u2014called occurrence list\u2014to pages that match the keyword. The trie is stored in the main memory, whereas the occurrence is kept in an external storage, frequently in large clusters, or the in-memory index points to documents stored in an external location.\nBioinformatics.\nTries are used in Bioinformatics, notably in sequence alignment software applications such as BLAST, which indexes all the different substring of length \"k\" (called k-mers) of a text by storing the positions of their occurrences in a compressed trie sequence databases.75\nInternet routing.\nCompressed variants of tries, such as databases for managing Forwarding Information Base (FIB), are used in storing IP address prefixes within routers and bridges for prefix-based lookup to resolve mask-based operations in IP routing.75\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31275", "revid": "526368", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31275", "title": "The Age of Reason", "text": "Work by Thomas Paine, published 1794, 1795 and 1807\nThe Age of Reason; Being an Investigation of True and Fabulous Theology is a work by English and American political activist Thomas Paine, arguing for the philosophical position of deism. It follows in the tradition of 18th-century British deism, and challenges institutionalized religion and the legitimacy of the Bible. It was published in three parts in 1794, 1795, and 1807.\nIt was a best-seller in the United States, where it caused a deistic revival. British audiences, fearing increased political radicalism as a result of the French Revolution, received it with more hostility. \"The Age of Reason\" presents common deistic arguments; for example, it highlights what Paine saw as corruption of the Christian Church and criticizes its efforts to acquire political power. Paine advocates reason in the place of revelation, leading him to reject miracles and to view the Bible as an ordinary piece of literature, rather than a divinely-inspired text. In \"The Age of Reason\", he promotes natural religion and argues for the existence of a creator god.\nMost of Paine's arguments had long been available to the educated elite, but by presenting them in an engaging and irreverent style, he made deism appealing and accessible to the masses. Originally distributed as unbound pamphlets, the book was also cheap, putting it within the reach of a large number of buyers. Fearing the spread of what it viewed as potentially-revolutionary ideas, the British government prosecuted printers and booksellers who tried to publish and distribute it. Nevertheless, Paine's work inspired and guided many free thinkers.\nHistorical context.\nIntellectual context: 18th-century British deism.\nPaine's book followed in the tradition of early 18th-century British deism. Those deists, while maintaining individual positions, still shared several sets of assumptions and arguments that Paine articulated in \"The Age of Reason\". The most important position that united the early deists was their call for \"free rational inquiry\" into all subjects, especially religion. Saying that early Christianity was founded on freedom of conscience, they demanded religious toleration and an end to religious persecution. They also demanded that debate rest on reason and rationality. Deists embraced a Newtonian worldview and believed that all things in the universe, even God, must obey the laws of nature. Without a concept of natural law, the deists argued, explanations of the workings of nature would descend into irrationality. This belief in natural law drove their skepticism of miracles. Because miracles had to be observed to be validated, deists rejected the accounts laid out in the Bible of God's miracles and argued that such evidence was neither sufficient nor necessary to prove the existence of God. Along these lines, deistic writings insisted that God, as the first cause or prime mover, had created and designed the universe with natural laws as part of his plan. They held that God does not repeatedly alter his plan by suspending natural laws to intervene (miraculously) in human affairs. Deists also rejected the claim that there was only one revealed religious truth or \"one true faith\". Religion had to be \"simple, apparent, ordinary, and universal\" if it was to be the logical product of a benevolent God. They, therefore, distinguished between \"revealed religions\", which they rejected, such as Christianity, and \"natural religion\", a set of universal beliefs derived from the natural world that demonstrated God's existence (and so they were not atheists).\nWhile some deists accepted revelation, most argued that revelation's restriction to small groups or even a single person limited its explanatory power. Moreover, many found the Christian revelations in particular to be contradictory and irreconcilable. According to those writers, revelation could reinforce the evidence for God's existence already apparent in the natural world but more often led to superstition among the masses. Most deists argued that priests had deliberately corrupted Christianity for their own gain by promoting the acceptance of miracles, unnecessary rituals, and illogical and dangerous doctrines (accusations typically referred to as \"priestcraft\"). The worst of the doctrines was original sin. By convincing people that they required a priest's help to overcome their innate sinfulness, deists argued, religious leaders had enslaved the human population. Deists therefore typically viewed themselves as intellectual liberators.\nPolitical context: French Revolution.\nBy the time Part I of \"The Age of Reason\" was published in 1794, many British and French citizens had become disillusioned by the French Revolution. The Reign of Terror had begun, Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette had been tried and executed and Britain was at war with France. The few British radicals who still supported the French revolution and its ideals were viewed with deep suspicion by their countrymen. \"The Age of Reason\" belongs to the later, more radical, stage of the British political reform movement, which openly embraced republicanism and sometimes atheism and was exemplified by such texts as William Godwin's \"Enquiry Concerning Political Justice\" (1793). (However, Paine and other deists were not atheists.) By the middle of the decade, the moderate voices had disappeared: Richard Price, the Dissenting minister whose sermon on political liberty had prompted Edmund Burke's \"Reflections on the Revolution in France\" (1790), had died in 1791, and Joseph Priestley had been forced to flee to America after a Church\u2013and\u2013King mob burned down his home and church.\nThe conservative government, headed by William Pitt, responded to the increasing radicalization by prosecuting several reformers for seditious libel and treason in the famous 1794 Treason Trials. Following the trials and an attack on George III, conservatives were successful in passing the Seditious Meetings Act and the Treasonable Practices Act (also known as the \"Two Acts\" or the \"gagging acts\"). The 1795 Acts prohibited freedom of assembly for groups such as the radical London Corresponding Society (LCS) and encouraged indictments against radicals for \"libelous and seditious\" statements. Afraid of prosecution and disenchanted with the French Revolution, many reformers drifted away from the cause. The LCS, which had previously unified religious Dissenters and political reformers, fractured when Francis Place and other leaders helped Paine publish \"The Age of Reason\". The society's more religious members withdrew in protest, and the LCS lost around a fifth of its membership.\nPublishing history.\nIn December 1792, Paine's \"Rights of Man, part II\", was declared seditious in Britain, and he was forced to flee to France to avoid arrest. Dismayed by the French revolution's turn toward secularism and atheism, he composed Part I of \"The Age of Reason\" in 1792 and 1793:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It has been my intention, for several years past, to publish my thoughts upon religion\u00a0... The circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity and of the theology that is true.\nAlthough Paine wrote \"The Age of Reason\" for the French, he dedicated it to his \"Fellow Citizens of the United States of America\", alluding to his bond with the American revolutionaries.\nIt is unclear when exactly Paine drafted Part I although he wrote in the preface to Part II:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nConceiving\u00a0... that I had but a few days of liberty, I sat down and brought the work to a close as speedily as possible; and I had not finished it more than six hours, in the state it has since appeared, before a guard came there, about three in the morning, with an order\u00a0... for putting me in arrestation as a foreigner, and conveying me to the prison of the Luxembourg. I contrived, in my way there, to call on Joel Barlow, and I put the Manuscript of the work into his hands\u00a0...\nAccording to Paine scholars Edward Davidson and William Scheick, he probably wrote the first draft of Part I in late 1793, but Paine biographer David Hawke argues for a date of early 1793. It is also unclear whether or not a French edition of Part I was published in 1793. Fran\u00e7ois Lanthenas, who translated \"The Age of Reason\" into French in 1794, wrote that it was first published in France in 1793, but no book fitting his description has been positively identified. Barlow published the first English edition of \"The Age of Reason, Part I\" in 1794 in London, selling it for a mere three pence.\nMeanwhile, Paine, considered too moderate by the powerful Jacobin Club of French revolutionaries, was imprisoned for ten months in France. He escaped the guillotine only by accident: the sign marking him out for execution was improperly placed on his cell door. When James Monroe, at that time the new American Minister to France, secured his release in 1794, Paine immediately began work on Part II of \"The Age of Reason\" despite his poor health. Part II was first published in a pirated edition by H.D. Symonds in London in October 1795. In 1796, Daniel Isaac Eaton published Parts I and II, and sold them at a cost of one shilling and six pence. (Eaton was later forced to flee to America after being convicted of seditious libel for publishing other radical works.) Paine himself financed the shipping of 15,000 copies of his work to America. Later, Francis Place and Thomas Williams collaborated on an edition, which sold about 2,000 copies. Williams also produced his own edition, but the British government indicted him and confiscated the pamphlets.\nIn the late 1790s, Paine fled from France to the United States, where he wrote Part III of \"The Age of Reason\": \"An Examination of the Passages in the New Testament, Quoted from the Old and Called Prophecies Concerning Jesus Christ\". Fearing unpleasant and even violent reprisals, Thomas Jefferson convinced him not to publish it in 1802. Five years later, Paine decided to publish despite the backlash he knew would ensue.\nFollowing Williams' sentence of one year's hard labor for publishing \"The Age of Reason\" in 1797, no editions were sold openly in Britain until 1818, when Richard Carlile included it in an edition of Paine's complete works. Carlile charged one shilling and sixpence for the work, and the first run of 1,000 copies sold out in a month. He immediately published a second edition of 3,000 copies. Like Williams, he was prosecuted for seditious libel and blasphemous libel. The prosecutions surrounding the printing of \"The Age of Reason\" in Britain continued for 30 years after its initial release and encompassed numerous publishers as well as over a hundred booksellers.\nStructure and major arguments.\n\"The Age of Reason\" is divided into three sections. In Part I, Paine outlines his major arguments and personal creed. In Part II (Old Testament and New Testament), he analyzes the Bible using proto intra-textual criticism to demonstrate that it is not the revealed word of God. Part III is a collection of personal letters responding to the publication of \"The Age of Reason\".\nPart I formulates a rule of evidence for religion and a theory of testimony. Revelation is definitionally confined to its initial recipient. For all others it reduces to hearsay. On that basis Paine rejects prophecy fulfillment and miracle reports as insufficiently attested and advances a civic ethic centered on justice, mercy, and human equality.\nPart II applies a distinctive mode of textual criticism grounded in public proof rather than clerical authority. Paine limits himself to the common English Bible, avoids appeals to Hebrew or Greek, and evaluates the documents with rules taken from ordinary documentary verification. He runs internal authorship tests that track narrative voice, third-person self-reference, retrospective phrases such as \"unto this day\", and deictic geography that presupposes a later vantage. He performs chronology and consistency checks by aligning sequences, counts, and named rulers across books. He assigns miracle reports a high evidential threshold, requires first-hand testimony and a transparent chain of custody, and withholds assent when the record reduces to hearsay or anonymous compilation. On this basis he infers post-Mosaic composition for the Pentateuch from the narrative of Moses death and other retrospective markers, treats the Gospel titles as late attributions, and highlights concrete conflicts such as the divergent genealogies of Jesus and the mismatch between Herod's reign and the census under Quirinius. The method treats scripture as historical literature subject to the same standards as any other witness and supplies the evidentiary ground for his critique of ecclesiastical authority and church\u2013state arrangements.\nPersonal Creed.\nAt the beginning of Part I of the \"Age of Reason\", Paine lays out his personal belief:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavouring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nBut, lest it should be supposed that I believe many other things in addition to these, I shall, in the progress of this work, declare the things I do not believe, and my reasons for not believing them.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish Church, by the Roman Church, by the Greek Church, by the Turkish Church, by the Protestant Church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.\nAll national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.\nI do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine. But it is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself. Infidelity does not consist in believing, or in disbelieving; it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe.\nPaine's creed encapsulates many of the major themes of the rest of his text, a firm belief in a creator-God, a skepticism regarding most supernatural claims, a conviction that virtues should be derived from a consideration for others rather than oneself, an animus against corrupt religious institutions, and an emphasis on the individual's right of conscience.\nReason and revelation.\nPaine opens \"The Age of Reason\" with a direct attack on revelation. Revelation, he maintains, carries force only for the original recipient, so it offers weak evidence for God's existence and leaves others without proof they can test. He limits religious knowledge to claims that any reader can evaluate in public and rejects prophecies and miracles unless named eyewitnesses and a traceable transmission establish their credibility. Urging readers to rely on reason rather than on revelation, Paine argues that only the natural world supplies consistent and universal evidence of a creator. \"The Bible of the Deist\", he writes, should be a divine work such as creation rather than a human invention such as the Bible.\nPaine extends this evidential program by insisting that the Bible must endure the same logical rules and standards of proof that govern secular texts. He treats scriptural documents as ordinary historical witnesses that must satisfy authorship, dating, and consistency tests before their theological claims merit consideration.\nAnalysis of the Bible.\nAfter pledging to use the Bible's own language rather than extra-Biblical authorities, Paine questions the book's sacred status and reads it with the same scrutiny he applies to secular literature. In his discussion of the Book of Proverbs he argues that its sayings are \"inferior in keenness to the proverbs of the Spaniards, and not more wise and economical than those of the American Franklin\". He calls the Bible \"fabulous mythology\", doubts that revelation guided its authors, and asserts that the original writers cannot be identified. Paine dismisses the claim that Moses composed the Pentateuch and treats the Gospel titles as later editorial attributions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;My intention is to show that those books are spurious, and that Moses is not the author of them, and still further, that they were not written in the time of Moses, nor till several hundred years afterward, that they are no other than an attempted history of the life of Moses, and of the times in which he is said to have lived, and also of the times prior thereto, written by some very ignorant and stupid pretenders to authorship, several hundred years after the death of Moses. ... The books called the Evangelists, and ascribed to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, were not written by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, ... they have been manufactured, as the books of the Old Testament have been by other persons than those whose names they bear.\nUsing methods that would not become common in Biblical scholarship until the 19th century, Paine tests the Bible for internal consistency, questions its historical accuracy, and concludes that it is not divinely inspired. He argues that the Old Testament must be false because it depicts a tyrannical God and because its narratives read like human-authored myths. He laments what he sees as the public's credulity, writing that \"brought up in habits of superstition\" the people \"know not how much wickedness there is in this pretended word of God\". Citing Numbers 31:13\u201347 as an example, in which Moses orders the slaughter of thousands of boys and women and sanctions the rape of thousands of girls at God's behest, Paine calls the Bible a \"book of lies, wickedness, and blasphemy, for what can be greater blasphemy than to ascribe the wickedness of man to the orders of the Almighty\".\nChurch and state.\nPaine also attacks religious institutions, indicting priests for their lust for power and wealth and the Church's opposition to scientific investigation. He presents the history of Christianity as one of corruption and oppression. Paine criticizes the tyrannical actions of the Church as he had those of governments in the \"Rights of Man\" and \"Common Sense\", stating that \"the Christian theory is little else than the idolatry of the ancient Mythologists, accommodated to the purposes of power and revenue\". That kind of attack distinguishes Paine's book from other deistic works, which were less interested in challenging social and political hierarchies. He argues that the Church and the state are a single corrupt institution that does not act in the best interests of the people and so both must be radically altered:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Soon after I had published the pamphlet \"Common Sense\", in America, I saw the exceeding probability that a revolution in the system of government would be followed by a revolution in the system of religion. The adulterous connection of Church and State, wherever it has taken place ... has so effectually prohibited by pains and penalties every discussion upon established creeds, and upon first principles of religion, that until the system of government should be changed, those subjects could not be brought fairly and openly before the world, but that whenever this should be done, a revolution in the system of religion would follow. Human inventions and priestcraft would be detected, and man would return to the pure, unmixed and unadulterated belief of one God, and no more.\nAs Jon Mee, a scholar of British radicalism, writes, \"Paine believed ... a revolution in religion was the natural corollary, even prerequisite, of a fully successful political revolution\". Paine lays out a vision of, in Davidson and Scheick's words, \"an age of intellectual freedom, when reason would triumph over superstition, when the natural liberties of humanity would supplant priestcraft and kingship, which were both secondary effects of politically managed foolish legends and religious superstitions\". It is this vision that scholars have called Paine's \"secular millennialism\" and it appears in all of his works. He ends the \"Rights of Man\", for example, with the statement, \"From what we now see, nothing of reform in the political world ought to be held improbable. It is an age of revolutions, in which everything may be looked for\". Paine \"transformed the millennial Protestant vision of the rule of Christ on earth into a secular image of utopia\", emphasizing the possibilities of \"progress\" and \"human perfectibility\" that could be achieved by humankind, without God's aid.\nIntellectual debts.\nAlthough Paine liked to say that he read very little, his writings belied that statement. \"The Age of Reason\" has intellectual roots in the traditions of David Hume, Spinoza, and Voltaire. Since Hume had already made many of the same \"moral attacks upon Christianity\" that Paine popularized in \"The Age of Reason\", scholars have concluded that Paine probably read Hume's works on religion or had at least heard about them through the Joseph Johnson circle. Paine would have been particularly drawn to Hume's description of religion as \"a positive source of harm to society\" that \"led men to be factious, ambitious and intolerant\". More of an influence on Paine than Hume was Spinoza's \"Tractatus Theologico-politicus\" (1678). Paine would have been exposed to Spinoza's ideas through the works of other 18th-century deists, most notably Conyers Middleton.\nThough these larger philosophical traditions are clear influences on \"The Age of Reason\", Paine owes the greatest intellectual debt to the English deists of the early 18th century, such as Peter Annet. John Toland argued for the use of reason in interpreting scripture. Matthew Tindal argued against revelation. Middleton described the Bible as mythology and questioned the existence of miracles. Thomas Morgan disputed the claims of the Old Testament. Thomas Woolston questioned the believability of miracles and Thomas Chubb maintained that Christianity lacked morality. All of those arguments appear in \"The Age of Reason\" albeit less coherently.\nRhetoric and style.\nThe most distinctive feature of \"The Age of Reason\", like all of Paine's works, is its linguistic style. Historian Eric Foner argues that Paine's works \"forged a new political language\" designed to bring politics to the people by using a \"clear, simple and straightforward\" style. Paine outlined \"a new vision\u2014a utopian image of an egalitarian republican society\" and his language reflected these ideals. He originated such phrases as \"the rights of man,\" \"the age of reason,\" \"the age of revolution,\" and \"the times that try men's souls.\" Foner also maintains that with \"The Age of Reason\" Paine \"gave deism a new, aggressive, explicitly anti-Christian tone\".\nHe did so by employing \"vulgar\" (that is, \"low\" or \"popular\") language, an irreverent tone, and even religious rhetoric. In a letter to Elihu Palmer, one of his most loyal followers in America, Paine describes part of his rhetorical philosophy:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The hinting and intimidating manner of writing that was formerly used on subjects of this kind [religion], produced skepticism, but not conviction. It is necessary to be bold. Some people can be reasoned into sense, and others must be shocked into it. Say a bold thing that will stagger them, and they will begin to think.\nPaine's rhetoric had broad appeal; his \"pithy\" lines were \"able to bridge working-class and middle-class cultures\" and become common quotations.\nPart of what makes Paine's style so memorable is his effective use of repetition and rhetorical questions in addition to the profusion of \"anecdote, irony, parody, satire, feigned confusion, folk matter, concrete vocabulary, and .. appeals to common sense\". Paine's conversational style draws the reader into the text. His use of \"we\" conveys an \"illusion that he and the readers share the activity of constructing an argument.\" By thus emphasizing the presence of the reader and leaving images and arguments half-formed, Paine encourages his readers to complete them independently.\n\"Vulgar\" language.\nThe most distinctive element of Paine's style in \"The Age of Reason\" is its \"vulgarity\". In the 18th century, \"vulgarity\" was associated with the middling and lower classes and not with obscenity and so when Paine celebrates his \"vulgar\" style and his critics attack it, the dispute is over class accessibility, not profanity. For example, Paine describes the Fall this way:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Christian Mythologists, after having confined Satan in a pit, were obliged to let him out again to bring on the sequel of the fable. He is then introduced into the Garden of Eden, in the shape of a snake or a serpent, and in that shape he enters into familiar conversation with Eve, who is no way surprised to hear a snake talk; and the issue of this t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate is that he persuades her to eat an apple, and the eating of that apple damns all mankind. After giving Satan this triumph over the whole creation, one would have supposed that the Church Mythologists would have been kind enough to send him back again to the pit: or, if they had not done this, that they would have put a mountain upon him (for they say that their faith can remove a mountain), or have put him \"under\" a mountain, as the former mythologists had done, to prevent his getting again among the women and doing more mischief. But instead of this they leave him at large, without even obliging him to give his parole\u2014the secret of which is that they could not do without him; and after being at the trouble of making him, they bribed him to stay. They promised him ALL the Jews, ALL the Turks by anticipation, nine-tenths of the world beside, and Mahomet into the bargain. After this, who can doubt the bountifulness of the Christian Mythology? Having thus made an insurrection and a battle in heaven, in which none of the combatants could be either killed or wounded\u2014put Satan into the pit\u2014let him out again\u2014gave him a triumph over the whole creation\u2014damned all mankind by the eating of an apple, these Christian Mythologists bring the two ends of their fable together. They represent this virtuous and amiable man, Jesus Christ, to be at once both God and Man, and also the Son of God, celestially begotten, on purpose to be sacrificed, because they say that Eve in her longing had eaten an apple. [emphasis Paine's]\nThe irreverent tone that Paine used, combined with the vulgar style, set his work apart from its predecessors. It took \"deism out of the hands of the aristocracy and intellectuals and [brought] it to the people\".\nPaine's rhetorical appeal to \"the people\" attracted almost as much criticism as his ridicule of the Bible. Bishop Richard Watson, forced to address the new audience in his influential response to Paine, \"An Apology for the Bible\", wrote: \"I shall, designedly, write this and the following letters in a popular manner; hoping that thereby they may stand a chance of being perused by that class of readers, for whom your work seems to be particularly calculated, and who are the most likely to be injured by it.\" However, it was not only the style that concerned Watson and others but also the cheapness of Paine's book. At one sedition trial in the early 1790s, the Attorney\u2013General tried to prohibit Thomas Cooper from publishing his response to Burke's \"Reflections on the Revolution in France\" and argued that \"although there was no exception to be taken to his pamphlet when in the hands of the upper classes, yet the government would not allow it to appear at a price which would insure its circulation among the people.\"\nIrreverent tone.\nPaine's style is not only \"vulgar\" but also irreverent. For example, he wrote that once one dismisses the false idea of Moses being the author of Genesis, \"The story of Eve and the serpent, and of Noah and his ark, drops to a level with the Arabian tales, without the merit of being entertaining.\" Although many early English deists had relied on ridicule to attack the Bible and Christianity, theirs was a refined wit rather than the broad humor that Paine employed. It was the early Deists of the middling ranks, not the educated elite, who initiated the kind of ridicule Paine would make famous.\nIt was Paine's \"ridiculing\" tone that most angered Churchmen. As John Redwood, a scholar of deism, puts it: \"the age of reason could perhaps more eloquently and adequately be called the age of ridicule, for it was ridicule, not reason, that endangered the Church.\" Significantly, Watson's \"Apology\" directly chastises Paine for his mocking tone:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I am unwilling to attribute bad designs, deliberate wickedness, to you or to any man; I cannot avoid believing, that you think you have truth on your side, and that you are doing service to mankind in endeavouring to root out what you esteem superstition. What I blame you for is this\u2014that you have attempted to lessen the authority of the Bible by ridicule, more than by reason.\nReligious influences.\nPaine's Quaker upbringing predisposed him to deistic thinking at the same time that it positioned him firmly within the tradition of religious Dissent. Paine acknowledged that he was indebted to his Quaker background for his skepticism, but the Quakers' esteem for plain speaking, a value expressed both explicitly and implicitly in \"The Age of Reason\", influenced his writing even more. As the historian E. P. Thompson has put it, Paine \"ridiculed the authority of the Bible with arguments which the collier or country girl could understand.\" His description of the story of the virgin birth of Jesus demystifies biblical language and is \"an account of a young woman engaged to be married, and while under this engagement she is, to speak plain language, debauched by a ghost.\" Quaker conversion narratives also influenced the style of \"The Age of Reason\". Davidson and Scheick argue that its \"introductory statement of purpose, a fervid sense of inward inspiration, a declared expression of conscience, and an evangelical intention to instruct others\" resemble the personal confessions of American Quakers.\nPaine takes advantage of several religious rhetorics beyond those associated with Quakerism in \"The Age of Reason\", most importantly by millennial language that appealed to his lower-class readers. Claiming that true religious language is universal, Paine uses elements of the Christian rhetorical tradition to undermine the hierarchies perpetuated by religion itself. The sermonic quality of Paine's writing is one of its most recognizable traits. Sacvan Bercovitch, a scholar of the sermon, argues that Paine's writing often resembles that of the jeremiad or \"political sermon.\" He contends that Paine draws on the Puritan tradition in which \"theology was wedded to politics and politics to the progress of the kingdom of God\". One reason that Paine may have been drawn to this style is because he may have briefly been a Methodist preacher, but that suspicion cannot be verified.\nReception and legacy.\n\"The Age of Reason\" provoked a hostile reaction from most readers and critics, although the intensity of that hostility varied by locality. There were four major factors for this animosity: Paine denied that the Bible was a sacred, inspired text; he argued that Christianity was a human invention; his ability to command a large readership frightened those in power; and his irreverent and satirical style of writing about Christianity and the Bible offended many believers.\nBritain.\nPaine's \"Age of Reason\" sparked enough anger in Britain to initiate not only a series of government prosecutions but also a pamphlet war. Around 50 unfavorable replies appeared between 1795 and 1799 alone, and refutations were still being published in 1812. Many of them responded specifically to Paine's attack on the Bible in Part II (when Thomas Williams was prosecuted for printing Part II, it became clear its circulation had far exceeded that of Part I). Although critics responded to Paine's analysis of the Bible, they did not usually address his specific arguments. Instead, they advocated a literal reading of the Bible, citing the Bible's long history as evidence of its authority. They also issued \"ad hominem\" attacks against Paine, describing him \"as an enemy of proper thought and of the morality of decent, enlightened people\". Dissenters such as Joseph Priestley, who had endorsed the arguments of the \"Rights of Man\", turned away from those presented in \"The Age of Reason\". Even the liberal \"Analytical Review\" was skeptical of Paine's claims and distanced itself from the book. Paine's deism was simply too radical for these more moderate reformers and they feared being tarred with the brush of extremism.\nDespite the outpouring of antagonistic replies to \"The Age of Reason\", some scholars have argued that Constantin Volney's deistic \"The Ruins\" (translations of excerpts from the French original appeared in radical papers such as Thomas Spence's \"Pig's Meat\" and Daniel Isaac Eaton's \"Politics for the People\") was actually more influential than \"The Age of Reason\". According to David Bindman, \"The Ruins\" \"achieved a popularity in England comparable to \"Rights of Man\" itself.\" One minister complained that \"the mischief arising from the spreading of such a pernicious publication [as \"The Age of Reason\"] was infinitely greater than any that could spring from limited suffrage and septennial parliaments\" (other popular reform causes).\nIt was not until Richard Carlile's 1818 trial for publishing \"The Age of Reason\" that Paine's text became \"the anti-Bible of all lower-class nineteenth-century infidel agitators\". Although the book had been selling well before the trial, once Carlile was arrested and charged, 4,000 copies were sold in just a few months. At the trial itself, which created a media frenzy, Carlile read the entirety of \"The Age of Reason\" into the court record, ensuring it an even wider publication. Between 1818 and 1822, Carlile claimed to have \"sent into circulation near 20,000 copies of the \"Age of Reason\"\". Just as in the 1790s, it was the language that most angered the authorities in 1818. As Joss Marsh, in her study of blasphemy in the 19th century, pointed out, \"at these trials plain English was reconfigured as itself 'abusive' and 'outrageous.' The \"Age of Reason\" struggle almost tolled the hour when the words 'plain,' 'coarse,' 'common,' and 'vulgar' took on a pejorative meaning.\" Carlile was convicted of blasphemy and sentenced to one year in prison but spent six years instead because he refused any \"legal conditions\" on his release.\nPaine's new rhetoric came to dominate popular 19th-century radical journalism, particularly that of freethinkers, Chartists and Owenites. Its legacy can be seen in Thomas Jonathan Wooler's radical periodical \"The Black Dwarf\", Carlile's numerous newspapers and journals, the radical works of William Cobbett, Henry Hetherington's periodicals the \"Penny Papers\" and the \"Poor Man's Guardian\", Chartist William Lovett's works, George Holyoake\"s newspapers and books on Owenism, and freethinker Charles Bradlaugh's \"New Reformer\". A century after the publication of \"The Age of Reason\", Paine's rhetoric was still being used: George William Foote's \"\"Bible Handbook\" (1888)\u00a0... systematically manhandles chapters and verses to bring out 'Contradictions,' 'Absurdities,' 'Atrocities,' and 'Obscenities,' exactly in the manner of Paine's \"Age of Reason\".\" The periodical \"The Freethinker\" (founded in 1881 by George Foote) argued, like Paine, that the \"absurdities of faith\" could be \"slain with laughter.\"\nFrance.\n\"The Age of Reason\", despite having been written for the French, made very little, if any, impact on revolutionary France. Paine wrote that \"the people of France were running headlong into atheism and I had the work translated into their own language, to stop them in that career, and fix them to the first article\u00a0... of every man's creed who has any creed at all \u2013 \"I believe in God\"\" (emphasis Paine's). Paine's arguments were already common and accessible in France; they had, in a sense, already been rejected.\nWhile still in France, Paine formed the Church of Theophilanthropy with five other families, a civil religion that held as its central dogma that man should worship God's wisdom and benevolence and imitate those divine attributes as much as possible. The church had no priest or minister, and the traditional Biblical sermon was replaced by scientific lectures or homilies on the teachings of philosophers. It celebrated four festivals honoring St. Vincent de Paul, George Washington, Socrates, and Rousseau. Samuel Adams articulated the goals of this church when he wrote that Paine aimed \"to renovate the age by inculcating in the minds of youth the fear and love of the Deity and universal philanthropy.\" The church closed in 1801, when Napoleon concluded a concordat with the Vatican.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, \"The Age of Reason\" initially caused a deistic \"revival\". Paine became so reviled that he could still be maligned as a \"filthy little atheist\" by Theodore Roosevelt over one hundred years later.\nAt the end of the 18th century, America was ripe for Paine's arguments. Ethan Allen published the first American defense of deism, \"Reason, The Only Oracle of Man\" (1784), but deism remained primarily a philosophy of the educated elite. Men such as Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson espoused its tenets but at the same time argued that religion served the useful purpose of \"social control.\" It was not until the publication of Paine's more entertaining and popular work that deism reached into the middling and lower classes in America. The public was receptive, in part, because they approved of the secular ideals of the French Revolution. \"The Age of Reason\" went through 17 editions and sold thousands of copies in the United States. Elihu Palmer, \"a blind renegade minister\" and Paine's most loyal follower in America, promoted deism throughout the country. Palmer published what became \"the bible of American deism\", \"The Principles of Nature\", established deistic societies from Maine to Georgia, built Temples of Reason throughout the nation, and founded two deistic newspapers for which Paine eventually wrote seventeen essays. Foner wrote, \"\"The Age of Reason\" became the most popular deist work ever written\u00a0... Before Paine it had been possible to be both a Christian and a deist; now such a religious outlook became virtually untenable.\" Paine presented deism to the masses, and, as in Britain, educated elites feared the consequences of such material in the hands of so many. Their fear helped to drive the backlash which soon followed.\nAlmost immediately after this deistic upsurge, the Second Great Awakening began. George Spater explains that \"the revulsion felt for Paine's \"Age of Reason\" and for other anti-religious thought was so great that a major counter-revolution had been set underway in America before the end of the eighteenth century.\" By 1796, every student at Harvard was given a copy of Watson's rebuttal of \"The Age of Reason\". In 1815, Parson Weems, an early American novelist and moralist, published \"God's Revenge Against Adultery\", in which one of the major characters \"owed his early downfall to reading 'PAINE'S AGE OF REASON'\". Paine's \"libertine\" text leads the young man to \"bold slanders of the bible\" even to the point that he \"threw aside his father's good old family bible, and for a surer guide to pleasure took up the AGE OF REASON!\"\nPaine could not publish Part III of \"The Age of Reason\" in America until 1807 because of the deep antipathy against him. Hailed only a few years earlier as a hero of the American Revolution, Paine was now lambasted in the press and called \"the scavenger of faction,\" a \"lilly-livered sinical [\"sic\"] rogue,\" a \"loathsome reptile,\" a \"demi-human archbeast,\" \"an object of disgust, of abhorrence, of absolute loathing to every decent man except the President of the United States [Thomas Jefferson].\" In October 1805 John Adams wrote to his friend Benjamin Waterhouse, an American physician and scientist:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI am willing you should call this the Age of Frivolity as you do, and would not object if you had named it the Age of Folly, Vice, Frenzy, Brutality, Daemons, Buonaparte [\"sic\"], Tom Paine, or the Age of the Burning Brand from Bottomless Pit, or anything but the Age of Reason. I know not whether any man in the world has had more influence on its inhabitants or affairs for the last thirty years than Tom Paine. There can be no severer satyr [\"sic\"] on the age. For such a mongrel between pig and puppy, begotten by a wild boar on a bitch wolf, never before in any age of the world was suffered by the poltroonery of mankind, to run through such a career of mischief. Call it then the Age of Paine.\nAdams viewed Paine's \"Age of Reason\" not as the embodiment of the Enlightenment but as a \"betrayal\" of it. Despite all of these attacks, Paine never wavered in his beliefs; when he was dying, a woman came to visit him, claiming that God had instructed her to save his soul. Paine dismissed her in the same tones that he had used in \"The Age of Reason\": \"pooh, pooh, it is not true. You were not sent with any such impertinent message\u00a0... Pshaw, He would not send such a foolish ugly old woman as you about with His message.\"\n\"The Age of Reason\" was largely ignored after 1820, except by radical groups in Britain and freethinkers in America, such as Robert G. Ingersoll and the American abolitionist Moncure Daniel Conway, who edited his works and wrote the first biography of Paine, favorably reviewed by \"The New York Times\". Not until the publication of Charles Darwin's \"The Origin of Species\" in 1859, and the large-scale abandonment of the literal reading of the Bible that it caused in Britain did many of Paine's ideas take hold. As writer Mark Twain said, \"It took a brave man before the Civil War to confess he had read the \"Age of Reason\"\u00a0... I read it first when I was a cub pilot, read it with fear and hesitation, but marveling at its fearlessness and wonderful power.\" Paine's criticisms of the church, the monarchy, and the aristocracy appear most clearly in Twain's \"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\" (1889).\nPaine's text is still published today, one of the few 18th-century religious texts to be widely available. Its message still resonates, evidenced by Christopher Hitchens, who stated that \"if the rights of man are to be upheld in a dark time, we shall require an age of reason\". His ends with the claim that \"in a time\u00a0... when both rights and reason are under several kinds of open and covert attack, the life and writing of Thomas Paine will always be part of the arsenal on which we shall need to depend.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31277", "revid": "915833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31277", "title": "The Bell Curve", "text": "1994 sociology book\nThe Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life is a 1994 book by the psychologist Richard J. Herrnstein and the political scientist Charles Murray in which the authors argue that human intelligence is substantially influenced by both inherited and environmental factors and that it is a better predictor of many personal outcomes, including financial income, job performance, birth out of wedlock, and involvement in crime, than is an individual's parental socioeconomic status. They also argue that those with high intelligence, the \"cognitive elite\", are becoming separated from those of average and below-average intelligence, and that this separation is a source of social division within the United States.\nThe book has been, and remains, highly controversial, especially where the authors discussed purported connections between race and intelligence and suggested policy implications based on these purported connections. The authors claimed that average intelligence quotient (IQ) differences between racial and ethnic groups are at least partly genetic in origin, a view that is now considered discredited by mainstream science. Many of the references and sources used in the book were advocates for racial hygiene, whose research was funded by the white supremacist organization Pioneer Fund and published in its affiliated journal \"Mankind Quarterly\". Because of this, some critics have dismissed the book and its purported findings as pseudoscience.\nShortly after its publication, many people rallied both in criticism and in defense of the book. A number of critical texts were written in response to it. Several criticisms were collected in the book \"The Bell Curve Debate\".\nSynopsis.\n\"The Bell Curve\", published in 1994, was written by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray to explain the variations in intelligence in American society, warn of some consequences of that variation, and propose social policies for mitigating the worst of the consequences. The book's title refers to the bell-shaped normal distribution of IQ scores observed in large populations.\nIntroduction.\nThe book starts with an introduction that appraises the history of the concept of intelligence from Francis Galton to modern times. Spearman's introduction of the general factor of intelligence and other early advances in research on intelligence are discussed along with a consideration of links between intelligence testing and racial politics. The 1960s are identified as the period in American history when social problems were increasingly attributed to forces outside the individual. This egalitarian ethos, Herrnstein and Murray argue, cannot accommodate biologically based individual differences.\nThe introduction states six of the authors' assumptions, which they claim to be \"beyond significant technical dispute\":\nAt the close of the introduction, the authors warn the reader against committing the ecological fallacy of inferring things about individuals based on the aggregate data presented in the book. They also assert that intelligence is just one of many valuable human attributes and one whose importance among human virtues is overrated.\nPart I. The Emergence of a Cognitive Elite.\nIn the first part of the book Herrnstein and Murray chart how American society was transformed in the 20th century. They argue that America evolved from a society where social origin largely determined one's social status to one where cognitive ability is the leading determinant of status. The growth in college attendance, a more efficient recruitment of cognitive ability, and the sorting of cognitive ability by selective colleges are identified as important drivers of this evolution. Herrnstein and Murray propose that the cognitive elite has been produced by a more technological society which offers enough high skill jobs for those with a higher intelligence to fill. They also propose that by removing race, gender or class as criteria (via the establishment of free primary education and the prohibition of discrimination) the main criterion of success in academic and professional life is cognitive ability. Increased occupational sorting by cognitive ability is discussed. They maintain that cognitive ability is the best predictor of worker productivity.\nHerrnstein and Murray argue that due to increasing returns to cognitive ability, a cognitive elite is being formed in America. They argue that this elite is getting richer and progressively more segregated from the rest of society.\nPart II. Cognitive Classes and Social Behavior.\nThe second part describes how cognitive ability is related to social behaviors: high ability predicts socially desirable behavior, low ability undesirable behavior. The argument is made that group differences in social outcomes are better explained by intelligence differences rather than socioeconomic status, a perspective, the authors argue, that has been neglected in research.\nThe analyses reported in this part of the book were done using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Labor Market Experience of Youth (NLSY), a study conducted by the United States Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics tracking thousands of Americans starting in the 1980s. Only non-Hispanic whites are included in the analyses so as to demonstrate that the relationships between cognitive ability and social behavior are not driven by race or ethnicity.\nHerrnstein and Murray argue that intelligence is a better predictor of individuals' outcomes than parental socioeconomic status. This argument is based on analyses where individuals' IQ scores are shown to better predict their outcomes as adults than the socioeconomic status of their parents. Such results are reported for many outcomes, including poverty, dropping out of school, unemployment, marriage, divorce, illegitimacy, welfare dependency, criminal offending, and the probability of voting in elections.\nAll participants in the NLSY took the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB), a battery of ten tests taken by all who apply for entry into the armed services. (Some had taken an IQ test in high school, and the median correlation of the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) scores and those IQ test scores was .81). Participants were later evaluated for social and economic outcomes. In general, Herrnstein and Murray argued, IQ/AFQT scores were a better predictor of life outcomes than social class background. Similarly, after statistically controlling for differences in IQ, they argued that many outcome differences between racial-ethnic groups disappeared.\nValues are the percentage of each IQ sub-population, among non-Hispanic whites only, fitting each descriptor.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPart III. The National Context.\nThis part of the book discusses ethnic differences in cognitive ability and social behavior. Herrnstein and Murray report that Asian Americans have a higher mean IQ than white Americans, who in turn outscore black Americans. The book argues that the black\u2013white gap is not due to test bias, noting that IQ tests do not tend to underpredict the school or job performance of black individuals and that the gap is larger on apparently culturally neutral test items than on more culturally loaded items. The authors also note that adjusting for socioeconomic status does not eliminate the black\u2013white IQ gap. However, they argue that the gap is narrowing.\nAccording to Herrnstein and Murray, the high heritability of IQ within races does not necessarily mean that the cause of differences between races is genetic. On the other hand, they discuss lines of evidence that have been used to support the thesis that the black\u2013white gap is at least partly genetic, such as Spearman's hypothesis. They also discuss possible environmental explanations of the gap, such as the observed generational increases in IQ, for which they coin the term Flynn effect. At the close of this discussion, they write:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If the reader is now convinced that either the genetic or environmental explanation has won out to the exclusion of the other, we have not done a sufficiently good job of presenting one side or the other. It seems highly likely to us that both genes and environment have something to do with racial differences. What might the mix be? We are resolutely agnostic on that issue; as far as we can determine, the evidence does not yet justify an estimate.\nThe authors also stress that regardless of the causes of differences, people should be treated no differently.\nIn Part III, the authors also repeat many of the analyses from Part II, but now compare whites to blacks and Hispanics in the NLSY dataset. They find that after controlling for IQ, many differences in social outcomes between races are diminished.\nThe authors discuss the possibility that high birth rates among those with lower IQs may exert a downward pressure on the national distribution of cognitive ability. They argue that immigration may also have a similar effect.\nAt the close of Part III, Herrnstein and Murray discuss the relation of IQ to social problems. Using the NLSY data, they argue that social problems are a monotonically decreasing function of IQ, in other words at lower IQ scores the frequency of social problems increases.\nLiving Together.\nIn this final chapter, the authors discuss the relevance of cognitive ability for understanding major social issues in America.\nEvidence for experimental attempts to raise intelligence is reviewed. The authors conclude that currently there are no means to boost intelligence by more than a modest degree.\nThe authors criticize the \"levelling\" of general and secondary education and defend gifted education. They offer a critical overview of affirmative action policies in colleges and workplaces, arguing that their goal should be equality of opportunity rather than equal outcomes.\nHerrnstein and Murray offer a pessimistic portrait of America's future. They predict that a cognitive elite will further isolate itself from the rest of society, while the quality of life deteriorates for those at the bottom of the cognitive scale. As an antidote to this prognosis, they offer a vision of society where differences in ability are recognized and everybody can have a valued place, stressing the role of local communities and clear moral rules that apply to everybody.\nPolicy recommendations.\nHerrnstein and Murray argued that the average genetic IQ of the United States is declining, owing to differential fertility patterns such as higher-IQ individuals having fewer children, shorter generation length among lower-IQ individuals, and immigration skewed toward groups with lower measured intelligence. They further predicted that an intellectually stratified society would adopt a new form of conservatism along Latin American lines and could evolve into a \"custodial state\" that would undermine American traditions of individualism and equal rights.\nThey also predict increasing totalitarianism: \"It is difficult to imagine the United States preserving its heritage of individualism, equal rights before the law, free people running their own lives, once it is accepted that a significant part of the population must be made permanent wards of the states.\"\nThe authors recommended the elimination of welfare policies which they claim encourage poor women to have babies.\nReception.\n\"The Bell Curve\" received a great deal of media attention. The book was not distributed in advance to the media, except for a few select reviewers picked by Murray and the publisher, which delayed more detailed critiques for months and years after the book's release. Stephen Jay Gould, reviewing the book in \"The New Yorker\", said that the book \"contains no new arguments and presents no compelling data to support its anachronistic social Darwinism\" and said that the \"authors omit facts, misuse statistical methods, and seem unwilling to admit the consequence of their own words.\"\nA 1995 article by Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting writer Jim Naureckas criticized the media response, saying that \"While many of these discussions included sharp criticisms of the book, media accounts showed a disturbing tendency to accept Murray and Herrnstein's premises and evidence even while debating their conclusions\". A 1995 article by the Brookings Institution argued that critics had narrowly focused their attention on the book's arguments regarding race and intelligence while ignoring other contents of the book, but added that \"the book may have fared even worse had the discussion of race and genetics not distracted attention from some serious problems of analysis and logic in its main arguments. There are indeed some useful messages in the book. But there is also much wrong with it.\"\nAfter reviewers had more time to review the book's research and conclusions, more significant criticisms began to appear. Nicholas Lemann, writing in \"Slate\", said that later reviews showed the book was \"full of mistakes ranging from sloppy reasoning to mis-citations of sources to outright mathematical errors.\" Lemann said that \"Unsurprisingly, all the mistakes are in the direction of supporting the authors' thesis.\"\nMany criticisms were collected in the book \"The Bell Curve Debate\".\nLack of peer review.\nHerrnstein and Murray did not submit their work to peer review before publication, an omission many have seen as incompatible with their presentation of it as a scholarly text. Nicholas Lemann noted that the book was not circulated in galley proofs, a common practice to allow potential reviewers and media professionals an opportunity to prepare for the book's arrival.\n\"Mainstream Science on Intelligence\" statement.\nAn opinion statement endorsing a number of the views presented in \"The Bell Curve\" called \"Mainstream Science on Intelligence\" was published in \"The Wall Street Journal\" in 1994 and subsequently reprinted in the journal \"Intelligence\". The statement was drafted by Linda Gottfredson, a professor of educational psychology at the University of Delaware. It was sent to 131 researchers whom Gottfredsen described as \"experts in intelligence and allied fields\". Of these, 52 signed the statement, 48 returned the request with an explicit refusal to sign, and 31 ignored the request.\nAccording to a 1996 response by former American Psychological Association president Donald Campbell, only ten of those who signed were actual experts in intelligence measurement. The Southern Poverty Law Center reports that 20 of the signers were recipients of funding from the white-supremacist organization the Pioneer Fund, including Gottfredson herself.\nIn subsequent years, both the substance and the interpretation of this letter have received widespread criticism from the scientific community.\nAPA task force report.\nIn response to the controversy surrounding \"The Bell Curve\", the American Psychological Association's Board of Scientific Affairs established a special task force chaired by Ulric Neisser to publish an investigative report focusing solely on the research presented in the book, not the policy recommendations that it made. The report, \"\", was first released in 1995 and published in \"American Psychologist\" in 1996.\nRegarding explanations for racial differences, the APA task force stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The cause of that differential is not known; it is apparently not due to any simple form of bias in the content or administration of the tests themselves. The Flynn effect shows that environmental factors can produce differences of at least this magnitude, but that effect is mysterious in its own right. Several culturally based explanations of the Black/White IQ differential have been proposed; some are plausible, but so far none has been conclusively supported. There is even less empirical support for a genetic interpretation. In short, no adequate explanation of the differential between the IQ means of Blacks and Whites is presently available.\n\"American Psychologist\" subsequently published eleven critical responses in January 1997.\nCriticism of assumptions.\nCriticism by Stephen Jay Gould.\nStephen Jay Gould wrote that the \"entire argument\" of the authors of \"The Bell Curve\" rests on four unsupported, and mostly false, assumptions about intelligence:\nIn a 1995 interview with Frank Miele of \"Skeptic\", Murray denied making each of these four assumptions.\nCriticism by James Heckman.\nThe Nobel Memorial Prize-winning economist James Heckman considers two assumptions made in the book to be questionable: that \"g\" accounts for correlation across test scores and performance in society, and that \"g\" cannot be manipulated. Heckman's reanalysis of the evidence used in \"The Bell Curve\" found contradictions:\nIn response, Murray argued that this was a straw man and that the book does not argue that \"g\" or IQ are totally immutable or the only factors affecting outcomes.\nIn a 2005 interview, Heckman praised \"The Bell Curve\" for breaking \"a taboo by showing that differences in ability existed and predicted a variety of socioeconomic outcomes\" and for playing \"a very important role in raising the issue of differences in ability and their importance\" and stated that he was \"a bigger fan of [\"The Bell Curve\"] than you might think.\" However, he also maintained that Herrnstein and Murray overestimated the role of heredity in determining intelligence differences.\nCriticism by Noam Chomsky.\nIn 1995, Noam Chomsky, a founder in the field of cognitive science, criticized the book and its assumptions on IQ. He takes issue with the idea that IQ is 60% heritable, arguing that the \"statement is meaningless\" because heritability does not have to be genetic. Chomsky gives the example of women wearing earrings:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He goes on to say there is almost no evidence of a genetic link, and greater evidence that environmental issues are what determine IQ differences.\nCriticism by Ned Block.\nPhilosopher Ned Block argues that \"The Bell Curve\" misleads about intelligence as it conflates genetic determination with heritability. Genetic determination and heritability are not interchangeable as there are traits that are genetically determined but not heritable, and vice versa. For example, the number of fingers on a human hand is genetically determined as genes code for five fingers in nearly everybody. However, the heritability of the number of fingers is very low, as variations in numbers of fingers are usually environmentally caused. The aforementioned earring example quoted by Chomsky is an instance where the opposite is true: high heritability, but not genetic determination. Given that genetic determination and heritability are not equivalent, Block contends that IQ is one such trait that is heritable but not genetically determined. Finally, Block contends that using twin studies to randomize the environment automatically fails: Black twins will always bring a part of their environment with them as they are both Black and will be treated as such.\nCanadian psychologist Sidney Segalowitz concurs with Block that twin studies fail to draw conclusions about heritability, and as a result Murray's work is methodologically flawed.\nStatistical methods.\nClaude S. Fischer, Michael Hout, Mart\u00edn S\u00e1nchez Jankowski, Samuel R. Lucas, Ann Swidler, and Kim Voss in the book \"Inequality by Design\" recalculated the effect of socioeconomic status, using the same variables as \"The Bell Curve\", but weighting them differently. They found that if IQ scores are adjusted, as Herrnstein and Murray did, to eliminate the effect of education, the ability of IQ to predict poverty can become dramatically larger, by as much as 61 percent for whites and 74 percent for blacks. According to the authors, Herrnstein and Murray's finding that IQ predicts poverty much better than socioeconomic status is substantially a result of the way they handled the statistics.\nIn August 1995, National Bureau of Economic Research economist Sanders Korenman and Harvard University sociologist Christopher Winship argued that measurement error was not properly handled by Herrnstein and Murray. Korenman and Winship concluded: \"...there is evidence of substantial bias due to measurement error in their estimates of the effects of parents' socioeconomic status. In addition, Herrnstein and Murray's measure of parental socioeconomic status (SES) fails to capture the effects of important elements of family background (such as single-parent family structure at age 14). As a result, their analysis gives an exaggerated impression of the importance of IQ relative to parents' SES, and relative to family background more generally. Estimates based on a variety of methods, including analyses of siblings, suggest that parental family background is at least as important, and may be more important than IQ in determining socioeconomic success in adulthood.\"\nIn the book \"Intelligence, Genes, and Success: Scientists Respond to The Bell Curve\", a group of social scientists and statisticians analyzes the genetics-intelligence link, the concept of intelligence, the malleability of intelligence and the effects of education, the relationship between cognitive ability, wages and meritocracy, pathways to racial and ethnic inequalities in health, and the question of public policy. This work argues that much of the public response was polemic, and failed to analyze the details of the science and validity of the statistical arguments underlying the book's conclusions.\nUse of Armed Forces Qualification Test.\nWilliam J. Matthews writes that part of \"The Bell Curve\"'s analysis is based on the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) \"which is not an IQ test but designed to predict performance of certain criterion variables\". The AFQT covers subjects such as trigonometry.\nHeckman observed that the AFQT was designed only to predict success in military training schools and that most of these tests appear to be achievement tests rather than ability tests, measuring factual knowledge and not pure ability. He continues:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Ironically, the authors delete from their composite AFQT score a timed test of numerical operations because it is not highly correlated with the other tests. Yet it is well known that in the data they use, this subtest is the single best predictor of earnings of all the AFQT test components. The fact that many of the subtests are only weakly correlated with each other, and that the best predictor of earnings is only weakly correlated with their \"g-loaded\" score, only heightens doubts that a single-ability model is a satisfactory description of human intelligence. It also drives home the point that the \"g-loading\" so strongly emphasized by Murray and Herrnstein measures only agreement among tests\u2014not predictive power for socioeconomic outcomes. By the same token, one could also argue that the authors have biased their empirical analysis against the conclusions they obtain by disregarding the test with the greatest predictive power.\nJanet Currie and Duncan Thomas presented evidence suggesting AFQT scores are likely better markers for family background than \"intelligence\" in a 1999 study:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Herrnstein and Murray report that conditional on maternal \"intelligence\" (AFQT scores), child test scores are little affected by variations in socio-economic status. Using the same data, we demonstrate their finding is very fragile.\nCognitive sorting and the \"cognitive elite\" concept.\nThe cognitive elite concept has been widely criticized. Frank Wilson refuted \"as cultural superstition and social science pornography \"The Bell Curve\"'s theories on the role of intelligence in the social stratification of postindustrial America.\" Nicholas Lemann described the notion of a cognitive elite as \"a sociological cartoon with political uses, not a phenomenon to be accepted at face value.\"\nCharles R. Tittle and Thomas Rotolo found that the more the written, IQ-like, examinations are used as screening devices for occupational access, the stronger the relationship between IQ and income. Thus, rather than higher IQ leading to status attainment because it indicates skills needed in a modern society, IQ may reflect the same test-taking abilities used in artificial screening devices by which status groups protect their domains.\nMin-Hsiung Huang and Robert M. Hauser write that Herrnstein and Murray provide scant evidence of growth in cognitive sorting. Using data from the General Social Survey, they tested each of these hypotheses using a short verbal ability test which was administered to about 12,500 American adults between 1974 and 1994; the results provided no support for any of the trend hypotheses advanced by Herrnstein and Murray. One chart in \"The Bell Curve\" purports to show that people with IQs above 120 have become \"rapidly more concentrated\" in high-IQ occupations since 1940. But Robert Hauser and his colleague Min-Hsiung Huang retested the data and came up with estimates that fell \"well below those of Herrnstein and Murray.\" They add that the data, properly used, \"do not tell us anything except that selected, highly educated occupation groups have grown rapidly since 1940.\"\nIn 1972, Noam Chomsky questioned Herrnstein's idea that society was developing towards a meritocracy. Chomsky criticized the assumptions that people only seek occupations based on material gain. He argued that Herrnstein would not want to become a baker or lumberjack even if he could earn more money that way. He also criticized the assumption that such a society would be fair with pay based on value of contributions. He argued that because there are already substantial inequalities, people will often be paid at levels that preserve such inequalities rather than commensurately with their contribution to society.\nRace and intelligence.\nOne part of the controversy concerned the parts of the book which dealt with racial group differences on IQ and the consequences of this. In chapter 13, the authors state: \"It seems highly likely to us that both genes and the environment have something to do with racial differences.\" The introduction to the chapter, however, provides the caveat that \"The debate about whether and how much genes and environment have to do with ethnic differences remains unresolved\".\nIn an article praising the book, economist Thomas Sowell criticized some of its aspects, including some of its arguments about race and the malleability of IQ:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When European immigrant groups in the United States scored below the national average on mental tests, they scored lowest on the abstract parts of those tests. So did white mountaineer children in the United States tested back in the early 1930s ... Strangely, Herrnstein and Murray refer to \"folklore\" that \"Jews and other immigrant groups were thought to be below average in intelligence.\" It was neither folklore nor anything as subjective as thoughts. It was based on hard data, as hard as any data in \"The Bell Curve\". These groups repeatedly tested below average on the mental tests of the World War I era, both in the army and in civilian life. For Jews, it is clear that later tests showed radically different results\u2014during an era when there was very little intermarriage to change the genetic makeup of American Jews.\nIn 1996, Stephen Jay Gould released a revised and expanded edition of his 1981 book \"The Mismeasure of Man\", intended to more directly refute many of \"The Bell Curve\"'s claims regarding race and intelligence, and argued that the evidence for heritability of IQ did not indicate a genetic origin to group differences in intelligence.\nPsychologist David Marks has suggested that the ASVAB test used in the analyses of \"The Bell Curve\" correlates highly with measures of literacy, and argues that the ASVAB test in fact is not a measure of general intelligence but of literacy.\nMelvin Konner, professor of anthropology and associate professor of psychiatry and neurology at Emory University, called \"Bell Curve\" a \"deliberate assault on efforts to improve the school performance of African-Americans\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This book presented strong evidence that genes play a role in intelligence but linked it to the unsupported claim that genes explain the small but consistent black-white difference in IQ. The juxtaposition of good argument with a bad one seemed politically motivated, and persuasive refutations soon appeared. Actually, African-Americans have excelled in virtually every enriched environment they have been placed in, most of which they were previously barred from, and this in only the first decade or two of improved but still not equal opportunity. It is likely that the real curves for the two races will one day be superimposable on each other, but this may require decades of change and different environments for different people. Claims about genetic potential are meaningless except in light of this requirement.\nThe 2014 textbook \"Evolutionary Analysis\" by Herron and Freeman devoted an entire chapter to debunking what they termed the \"Bell Curve fallacy\", saying that \"Murray and Herrnstein's argument amounts to little more than an appeal to\npersonal incredulity\" and that it is a mistake to think that heritability can tell us something about the causes of differences between population means. In reference to the comparison of African-American with European-American IQ scores, the text states that only a common garden experiment, in which the two groups are raised in an environment typically experienced by European-Americans, would allow one to see if the difference is genetic. This kind of experiment, routine with plants and animals, cannot be conducted with humans. Nor is it possible to approximate this design with adoptions into families of the different groups, because the children would be recognizable and possibly be treated differently. The text concludes: \"There is no way to assess whether genetics has anything to do with the difference in IQ score between ethnic groups.\"\nRutledge M. Dennis suggests that through soundbites of works like Jensen's famous study on the achievement gap, and Herrnstein and Murray's book \"The Bell Curve\", the media \"paints a picture of Blacks and other people of color as collective biological illiterates\u2014as not only intellectually unfit but evil and criminal as well\", thus providing, he says \"the logic and justification for those who would further disenfranchise and exclude racial and ethnic minorities\".\nCharles Lane pointed out that 17 of the researchers whose work is referenced by the book have also contributed to \"Mankind Quarterly\", a journal of anthropology founded in 1960 in Edinburgh, which has been viewed as supporting the theory of the genetic superiority of white people. David Bartholomew reports Murray's response as part of the controversy over the Bell Curve. In his afterword to the 1996 Free Press edition of \"The Bell Curve\", Murray responded that the book \"draws its evidence from more than a thousand scholars\" and among the researchers mentioned in Lane's list \"are some of the most respected psychologists of our time and that almost all of the sources referred to as tainted are articles published in leading refereed journals\".\n\"The Bell Curve Wars: Race, Intelligence, and the Future of America\" is a collection of articles published in reaction to the book. Edited by Steven Fraser, the writers of these essays do not have a specific viewpoint concerning the content of \"The Bell Curve\", but express their own critiques of various aspects of the book, including the research methods used, the alleged hidden biases in the research and the policies suggested as a result of the conclusions drawn by the authors. Fraser writes that \"by scrutinizing the footnotes and bibliography in \"The Bell Curve\", readers can more easily recognize the project for what it is: a chilly synthesis of the work of disreputable race theorists and eccentric eugenicists\".\nAllegations of racism.\nSince the book provided statistical data making the assertion that blacks were, on average, less intelligent than whites, some people have argued that \"The Bell Curve\" could be used by extremists to justify genocide and hate crimes. Much of the work referenced by \"The Bell Curve\" was funded by the Pioneer Fund, which aims to advance the scientific study of heredity and human differences, and which has been accused of promoting white supremacist views, particularly scientific racism. Murray criticized the characterization of the Pioneer Fund as a racist organization, arguing that it has as much relationship to its founder as \"Henry Ford and today's Ford Foundation\".\nEvolutionary biologist Joseph L. Graves described \"The Bell Curve\" as an example of racist science, containing all the types of errors in the application of scientific method that have characterized the history of scientific racism:\nEric Siegel wrote on the \"Scientific American\" blog that the book \"endorses prejudice by virtue of what it does not say. Nowhere does the book address why it investigates racial differences in IQ. By never spelling out a reason for reporting on these differences in the first place, the authors transmit an unspoken yet unequivocal conclusion: Race is a helpful indicator as to whether a person is likely to hold certain capabilities. Even if we assume the presented data trends are sound, the book leaves the reader on his or her own to deduce how to best put these insights to use. The net effect is to tacitly condone the prejudgment of individuals based on race.\" Similarly, Howard Gardner accused the authors of engaging in \"scholarly brinkmanship\", arguing that \"Whether concerning an issue of science, policy, or rhetoric, the authors come dangerously close to embracing the most extreme positions, yet in the end shy away from doing so\u00a0... Scholarly brinkmanship encourages the reader to draw the strongest conclusions, while allowing the authors to disavow this intention.\"\nColumnist Bob Herbert, writing for \"The New York Times\", described the book as \"a scabrous piece of racial pornography masquerading as serious scholarship\". \"Mr. Murray can protest all he wants\", wrote Herbert; \"his book is just a genteel way of calling somebody a nigger.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31278", "revid": "39276444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31278", "title": "House of Tudor", "text": "English royal house of Welsh origin\nThe House of Tudor (, ) was an English and Welsh dynasty that held the throne of England from 1485 to 1603. They descended ultimately from Ednyfed Fychan and the Tudors of Penmynydd, a Welsh noble family, and Catherine of Valois. The Tudor monarchs were also descended from the House of Lancaster. They ruled the Kingdom of England and the Lordship of Ireland (later the Kingdom of Ireland) for 118 years with five monarchs: Henry VII, Henry VIII, Edward VI, Mary I and Elizabeth I. The Tudors succeeded the House of Plantagenet as rulers of the Kingdom of England, and were succeeded by the Scottish House of Stuart. The first Tudor monarch, Henry VII, descended through his mother from the House of Beaufort, a legitimised branch of the English royal House of Lancaster, a cadet house of the Plantagenets. The Tudor family rose to power and started the Tudor period in the wake of the Wars of the Roses (1455\u20131487), which left the main House of Lancaster (with which the Tudors were aligned) extinct in the male line.\nHenry VII (a descendant of Edward III, and the son of Edmund Tudor, a half-brother of Henry VI) succeeded in presenting himself as a candidate not only for traditional Lancastrian supporters, but also for discontented supporters of their rival Plantagenet cadet House of York, and he took the throne by right of conquest. Following his victory at the Battle of Bosworth Field (22 August 1485), he reinforced his position in 1486 by fulfilling his 1483 vow to marry Elizabeth of York, daughter of King Edward IV and the heiress of the Yorkist claim to the throne, thus symbolically uniting the former warring factions of Lancaster and York under the new dynasty (represented by the Tudor rose). The Tudors extended their power beyond modern England, achieving the full union of England and the Principality of Wales in 1542 (Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542), and successfully asserting English authority over the Kingdom of Ireland (proclaimed by the Crown of Ireland Act 1542). They also maintained the nominal English claim to the Kingdom of France; although none of them made substance of it, Henry VIII fought wars with France primarily as a matter of international alliances but also asserting claim to the title. After him, his daughter Mary I lost control of all territory in France permanently with the Siege of Calais in 1558.\nIn total, the Tudor monarchs ruled their domains for 118 years. Henry VIII (r.\u20091509\u00a0\u2013\u00a01547) was the only son of Henry VII to live to the age of maturity, and he proved a dominant ruler. Issues around royal succession (including marriage and the succession rights of women) became major political themes during the Tudor era, as did the English Reformation in religion, impacting the future of the Crown. Elizabeth I was the longest serving Tudor monarch at 44 years, and her reign\u2014known as the Elizabethan Era\u2014provided a period of stability after the short, troubled reigns of her siblings. When Elizabeth I died childless, her cousin of the Scottish House of Stuart succeeded her, in the Union of the Crowns of 24 March 1603. The first Stuart to become King of England (r.\u20091603\u00a0\u2013\u00a01625), James VI and I, was a great-grandson of Henry VII's daughter Margaret Tudor, who in 1503 had married James IV of Scotland in accordance with the 1502 Treaty of Perpetual Peace. A connection persists to the present 21st century, as Charles III is a ninth-generation descendant of George I, who in turn was James VI and I's great-grandson.\nAscent to the throne.\nThe Tudors descended from King Edward III on Henry VII's mother's side from John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset, one of the illegitimate children of the 14th century English prince John of Gaunt, the third surviving son of Edward III. Beaufort's mother was Gaunt's long-term mistress, Katherine Swynford.\nThe descendants of an illegitimate child of English royalty would normally have no claim on the throne, although Gaunt and Swynford eventually married in 1396, when John Beaufort was 25. The church then retroactively declared the Beauforts legitimate by way of a papal bull the same year, confirmed by an Act of Parliament in 1397. A subsequent proclamation by John of Gaunt's son by his first wife Blanche of Lancaster, King Henry IV, also recognised the Beauforts' legitimacy but declared the line ineligible for the throne.\nNevertheless, the Beauforts remained closely allied with Gaunt's descendants from his first marriage, the House of Lancaster, during the civil wars known as the Wars of the Roses. However the descent from the Beauforts did not necessarily render Henry Tudor (Henry VII) heir to the throne, nor did the fact that his paternal grandmother, Catherine of Valois, had been Queen of England due to her first marriage to Henry V (although, this did make Henry VII a nephew of Henry VI).\nThe legitimate claim was that of Henry Tudor's wife, Elizabeth of York, as daughter to Edward IV, and descendant of the second son of Edward III, Lionel, Duke of Clarence, and also his fourth son, Edmund, Duke of York. As she had no surviving brothers, Elizabeth had the strongest claim to the crown as de facto heiress of the House of York, but while she became queen consort, she did not rule as queen regnant; for the last attempt a female made at ruling in her own right had resulted in disaster when Henry II's mother, Empress Matilda, and her cousin, Stephen of Blois, fought bitterly for the throne in the 12th century.\nFamily connections and the Wars of the Roses.\nSources:\nHenry Tudor had, however, something that the others did not. He had an army which defeated the last Yorkist king, Richard III, in the field of battle and the support of powerful nobles to take the crown by right of conquest. Richard III's accession to the throne had proved controversial, even among the Yorkists.\nHenry Tudor, as Henry VII, and his son by Elizabeth of York, Henry VIII eliminated other claimants to the throne, including his first cousin once removed, Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury, and her son Henry Pole, 1st Baron Montagu, as well as Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter.\nOn 1 November 1455, John Beaufort's granddaughter, Margaret Beaufort, married Henry VI's maternal half-brother Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond. It was his father, Owen Tudor (), who abandoned the Welsh patronymic naming practice and adopted a fixed surname. When he did, he did not choose, as was generally the custom, his father's name, Maredudd, but chose that of his grandfather, Tudur ap Goronwy, instead.\nThis name is sometimes given as \"Tewdwr\", the Welsh form of Theodore, but Modern Welsh \"Tudur\", Old Welsh \"Tutir\" is originally not a variant but a different and completely unrelated name, etymologically identical with Gaulish \"Toutorix\", from Proto-Celtic \"*tout\u0101\" \"people, tribe\" and \"*r\u012bxs\" \"king\" (compare Modern Welsh \"tud\" \"territory\" and \"rhi\" \"king\" respectively), corresponding to Germanic Theodoric.\nOwen Tudor was one of the bodyguards for the queen dowager Catherine of Valois, whose husband, Henry V, had died in 1422. Evidence suggests that the two were secretly married in 1428. Two sons born of the marriage, Edmund and Jasper, were among the most loyal supporters of the House of Lancaster in its struggle against the House of York.\nHenry VI ennobled his half-brothers: Edmund became Earl of Richmond on 15 December 1449 and was married to Lady Margaret Beaufort, the great-granddaughter of John of Gaunt, the progenitor of the house of Lancaster; Jasper became Earl of Pembroke on 23 November 1452. Edmund died on 3 November 1456. On 28 January 1457, his widow Margaret, who was only 13 at the time, gave birth to a son, Henry Tudor, at her brother-in-law's residence at Pembroke Castle.\nHenry Tudor, the future Henry VII, spent his childhood at Raglan Castle, the home of Lord Herbert, a leading Yorkist. Following the murder of Henry VI and death of his son, Edward, at the Battle of Tewkesbury in 1471, Henry became the person upon whom the Lancastrian cause rested. Concerned for his young nephew's life, Jasper Tudor took Henry to Brittany for safety.\nLady Margaret remained in England and remarried, living quietly while advancing the Lancastrian (and her son's) cause. Capitalizing on the growing unpopularity of Richard III (King of England from 1483), she was able to forge an alliance with discontented Yorkists in support of her son. Two years after Richard III was crowned, Henry and Jasper sailed from the mouth of the Seine to the Milford Haven Waterway and defeated Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field on 22 August 1485. Upon this victory, Henry Tudor proclaimed himself King Henry VII.\nHistory.\nHenry VII.\nUpon becoming king in 1485, Henry VII moved rapidly to secure his hold on the throne. On 18 January 1486, at Westminster Abbey, he honoured a pledge made three years earlier and married Elizabeth of York, daughter of King Edward IV. They were third cousins, as both were great-great-grandchildren of John of Gaunt. The marriage unified the warring houses of Lancaster and York and gave the couple's children a strong claim to the throne. The unification of the two houses through this marriage is symbolised by the heraldic emblem of the Tudor rose, a combination of the white rose of York and the red rose of Lancaster.\nHenry VII and Elizabeth of York had seven children, four of whom survived early childhood:\nHenry VII's foreign policy had an objective of dynastic security: he formed an alliance with Scotland with the marriage in 1503 of his daughter Margaret to James IV of Scotland, and with Spain through the marriage of his son Arthur to Catherine of Aragon, cementing an alliance with the Spanish monarchs, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile. The newlyweds spent their honeymoon at Ludlow Castle, the traditional seat of the Prince of Wales. However, four months after the marriage, Arthur died, leaving his younger brother Henry as heir apparent. Henry VII acquired a papal dispensation allowing prince Henry to marry Arthur's widow; however, Henry VII delayed the marriage.\nHenry VII limited his involvement in European politics. He went to war only twice: once in 1489 during the French\u2013Breton War and the invasion of Brittany, and in 1496\u20131497 in revenge for Scottish support of Perkin Warbeck and for the Scottish invasion of northern England. Henry VII made peace with France in 1492 and the war against Scotland was abandoned because of the Cornish rebellion of 1497. Henry VII made peace with James IV in 1502 with the Treaty of Perpetual Peace, paving the way for the marriage of his daughter Margaret.\nOne of the main concerns of Henry VII during his reign was the re-accumulation of the funds in the royal treasury. England had never been one of the wealthier European countries, and after the Wars of the Roses this was even more true. Through his strict monetary strategy, he was able to leave a considerable amount of money in the Treasury for his son and successor, Henry VIII. Although it is debated whether Henry VII was a great king, he certainly was a successful one if only because he restored the nation's finances, strengthened the judicial system and successfully denied all other claimants to the throne, thus further securing it for his heir.\nHenry VIII.\nThe new King Henry VIII succeeded to the throne on 22 April 1509. He married Catherine of Aragon on 11 June; they were crowned at Westminster Abbey on 24 June. Catherine had previously been the wife of Henry's older brother Arthur (died 1502); this fact made the course of their marriage a rocky one from the start. A papal dispensation had to be granted for Henry to be able to marry Catherine, and the negotiations took some time. Despite the fact that Henry's father died before he was married to Catherine, he was determined to marry her anyway and to make sure that everyone knew he intended on being his own master.\nWhen Henry first came to the throne, he had very little interest in actually ruling; rather, he preferred to indulge in luxuries and to partake in sports. He let others control the kingdom for the first two years of his reign, and then when he became more interested in military strategy, he took more interest in ruling his own realm. In his younger years, Henry was described as a man of gentle friendliness, gentle in debate, and who acted as more of a companion than a king. He was tall, handsome and cultured and generous in his gifts and affection and was said to be easy to get along with. The Henry that many people picture when they hear his name is the Henry of his later years, when he became obese, volatile, and was known for his great cruelty.\nCatherine did not bear Henry the sons he was desperate for; her first child, a daughter, was stillborn, and her second child, a son named Henry, Duke of Cornwall, died 52 days after birth. A further set of stillborn children followed, until a surviving daughter, Mary, was born in 1516. When it became clear to Henry that the Tudor line was at risk, he consulted his chief minister Cardinal Wolsey about the possibility of annulling his marriage to Catherine. Along with Henry's concern that he would not have an heir, it was also obvious to his court that he was becoming tired of his aging wife, who was six years older than he was. Wolsey visited Rome, where he hoped to get the Pope's consent for an annulment. However, the Holy See was reluctant to rescind the earlier papal dispensation and felt heavy pressure from Catherine's nephew, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, in support of his aunt. Catherine contested the proceedings, and a protracted legal battle followed. Wolsey fell from favour in 1529 as a result of his failure to procure the annulment, and Henry appointed Thomas Cromwell in his place as chief minister c.\u20091532.\nDespite his failure to produce the results that Henry wanted, Wolsey actively pursued the annulment (divorce was synonymous with annulment at that time). However, Wolsey never planned that Henry would marry Anne Boleyn, with whom the king had become enamoured while she served as a lady-in-waiting in Queen Catherine's household. It is unclear how far Wolsey was actually responsible for the English Reformation, but it is very clear that Henry's desire to marry Anne Boleyn precipitated the schism with Rome. Henry's concern about having an heir to secure his family line and to increase his security while alive would have prompted him to ask for an annulment sooner or later, whether Anne had precipitated it or not. Wolsey's sudden death at Leicester on 29 November 1530 on his journey to the Tower of London saved him from the public humiliation and inevitable execution he would have suffered upon his arrival at the Tower.\nBreak with Rome.\nIn order to allow Henry to dissolve his marriage and marry Anne Boleyn, the English parliament enacted laws breaking ties with Rome, and declaring the king Supreme Head of the Church of England (from Elizabeth I the monarch is known as the Supreme Governor of the Church of England), thus severing the ecclesiastical structure of England from the Catholic Church and the Pope. The newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer, was then able to declare Henry's marriage to Catherine void. Catherine was banished from court, and she spent the last three years of her life in various English houses under \"protectorship\", similar to house arrest. This allowed Henry to marry Anne Boleyn. She gave birth on 7 September 1533 to a daughter, Elizabeth, named in honour of Henry's mother. Anne had two further pregnancies which ended in miscarriage. In 1536, Anne was arrested, along with six courtiers. Thomas Cromwell, Anne's former ally, stepped in again, claiming that she had taken lovers during her marriage to Henry, including her own brother, George Boleyn, and she was tried for high treason and incest. These charges were most likely fabricated, but she was found guilty and executed in May 1536.\nProtestant alliance.\nHenry married again, for a third time, to Jane Seymour, the daughter of a Wiltshire knight, and with whom he had become enamoured while she was still a lady-in-waiting to Queen Anne. Jane became pregnant, and in 1537 produced a son, who became King Edward VI following Henry's death in 1547. Jane died of puerperal fever only a few days after the birth, leaving Henry devastated. Cromwell continued to gain the king's favour when he designed and pushed through the Laws in Wales Acts, uniting England and Wales.\nIn 1540, Henry married for the fourth time to the daughter of a Protestant German duke, Anne of Cleves, thus forming an alliance with the Protestant German states. Henry was reluctant to marry again, especially to a Protestant, but he was persuaded when the court painter Hans Holbein the Younger showed him a flattering portrait of her. She arrived in England in December 1539, and Henry rode to Rochester to meet her on 1 January 1540. Although the historian Gilbert Burnet claimed that Henry called her a \"Flanders Mare\", there is no evidence that he said this; in truth, court ambassadors negotiating the marriage praised her beauty. Whatever the circumstances were, the marriage failed, and Anne agreed to a peaceful annulment, assumed the title \"My Lady, the King's Sister\", and received a large settlement, which included Richmond Palace, Hever Castle, and numerous other estates across the country. Although the marriage made sense in terms of foreign policy, Henry was still enraged and offended by the match. Henry chose to blame Cromwell for the failed marriage, and ordered him beheaded on 28 July 1540. Henry kept his word and took care of Anne in his last years alive; however, after his death Anne suffered from extreme financial hardship because Edward VI's councillors refused to give her any funds and confiscated the homes she had been given. She pleaded to her brother to let her return home, but he only sent a few agents who tried to assist in helping her situation and refused to let her return home. Anne died on 16 July 1557 in Chelsea Manor.\nThe fifth marriage was to the young Catherine Howard, niece of the Catholic Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk. Catherine was promoted by Norfolk in the hope that she would persuade Henry to restore the Catholic religion in England. Henry called her his \"rose without a thorn\", but the marriage ended in failure. Henry's infatuation with Catherine started before the end of his marriage with Anne when she was still a member of Anne's court. Catherine was young and vivacious, but Henry's age made him less inclined to use Catherine in the bedroom; rather, he preferred to admire her, which Catherine soon grew tired of. Catherine, forced into a marriage to an unattractive, obese man over 30 years her senior, had never wanted to marry Henry, and allegedly conducted an affair with the King's favourite, Thomas Culpeper, while Henry and she were married. During her questioning, Catherine first denied everything but eventually she was broken down and told of her infidelity and her pre-nuptial relations with other men. Henry, first enraged, threatened to torture her to death but later became overcome with grief and self-pity. She was accused of treason and was executed on 13 February 1542, destroying the English Catholic holdouts' hopes of a national reconciliation with the Catholic Church. Her execution also marked the end of the Howard family's power and influence within the English court.\nBy the time Henry conducted another marriage with his final wife Catherine Parr in July 1543, the old Roman Catholic advisers, including the Duke of Norfolk, had lost all their power and influence. Norfolk himself was still a committed Catholic, and he was nearly persuaded to arrest Catherine for preaching Lutheran doctrines to Henry while she attended his ill health. However, she managed to reconcile with the King after vowing that she had only argued about religion with him to take his mind off the suffering caused by his ulcerous leg. Her peacemaking also helped reconcile Henry with his daughters Mary and Elizabeth and fostered a good relationship between her and Edward.\nEdward VI.\nHenry died on 28 January 1547. His will had reinstated his daughters by his annulled marriages to Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn to the line of succession. Edward, his nine-year-old son by Jane Seymour, succeeded as Edward VI of England. Unfortunately, the young King's kingdom was usually in turmoil between nobles who were trying to strengthen their own positions in the kingdom by using the Regency in their favour.\nEngland under Lord Somerset.\nAlthough Henry had specified a group of men to act as regents during Edward's minority, Edward Seymour, the young king's uncle, quickly seized control and created himself Duke of Somerset on 15 February 1547. His domination of the Privy Council, the king's most senior body of advisers, was unchallenged. Somerset aimed to unite England and Scotland by marrying Edward to his cousin, the young Mary, Queen of Scots, and aimed to forcibly impose the English Reformation on the Church of Scotland. Somerset led a large and well equipped army to Scotland, where he and the Scottish regent James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Arran, commanded their armies at the Battle of Pinkie on 10 September 1547. The English won the battle, and after this Queen Mary was smuggled to France, where she was betrothed to the Dauphin, the future King Francis II of France. Despite Somerset's disappointment that no Scottish marriage would take place, his victory at Pinkie made his position appear unassailable.\nEdward VI was taught that he had to lead religious reform. In 1549, the Crown ordered the publication of the Book of Common Prayer, containing the forms of worship for daily and Sunday church services. The controversial new book was not welcomed by either reformers or Catholic conservatives; it was especially condemned in Devon and Cornwall, where traditional Catholic loyalty was at its strongest. In Cornwall at the time, many of the people could only speak the Cornish language, so the uniform English Bibles and church services were not understood by many. This caused the Prayer Book Rebellion, in which groups of Cornish non-conformists gathered round the mayor. The rebellion worried Somerset, now Lord Protector, and he sent an army to impose a military solution to the rebellion. The rebellion hardened the Crown against Catholics. Fear of Catholicism focused on Edward's elder half-sister, Mary, who was a pious and devout Catholic. Although called before the Privy Council several times to renounce her faith and stop hearing the Catholic Mass, she refused. Edward had a good relationship with his sister Elizabeth, who was a Protestant, albeit a moderate one, but this was strained when Elizabeth was accused of having an affair with the Duke of Somerset's brother, Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley, who had married Henry VIII's widow, Catherine Parr. Seymour had invaded Edward's apartments and had killed his dog in a scheme to forcefully gain control over him.\nElizabeth was interviewed by one of Edward's advisers, and she was eventually found not to be guilty, despite forced confessions from her servants Kat Ashley and Sir Thomas Parry. Thomas Seymour was beheaded on 20 March 1549.\nProblematic succession.\nLord Protector Somerset was also losing favour. After forcibly removing Edward VI to Windsor Castle, with the intention of keeping him hostage, Somerset was removed from power by members of the council, led by his chief rival, John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, who created himself Duke of Northumberland shortly after his rise. Northumberland effectively became Lord Protector, but he did not use this title, learning from the mistakes his predecessor made. Northumberland was furiously ambitious, and aimed to secure Protestant uniformity while making himself rich with land and money in the process. He ordered churches to be stripped of all traditional Catholic symbolism, resulting in the simplicity often seen in Church of England churches today. A revision of the Book of Common Prayer was published in 1552. When Edward VI became ill in 1553, his advisers looked to the possible imminent accession of the Catholic Lady Mary, and feared that she would overturn all the reforms made during Edward's reign. Perhaps surprisingly, it was the dying Edward himself who feared a return to Catholicism, and wrote a new will repudiating the 1544 will of Henry VIII. This gave the throne to his cousin Lady Jane Grey, the granddaughter of Henry VIII's sister Mary Tudor, who, after the death of Louis XII of France in 1515 had married Henry VIII's favourite Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk.\nEdward VI died on 6 July 1553, at the age of 15. With his death, the direct male line of the House of Tudor ended.\nJane.\nThe dying Edward VI, under the pressure of John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, named his cousin and Northumberland's daughter-in-law, Lady Jane Grey, as his successor due to her Protestant beliefs. Edward's reluctance to follow the line of succession, which named his half-sister Mary as next in line, stemmed from his knowledge that Mary, firmly Catholic, would restore England to the Vatican. Lady Jane Grey was consistently at court after her father was made Duke of Suffolk in October 1551. Her mother, Frances Grey, Duchess of Suffolk, was the daughter of Mary Tudor, the sister of Henry VIII. On 21 May 1553, Jane was married to Northumberland's son, Lord Guildford Dudley. This was a political move organised by the Duke to ensure that Protestantism stayed the national religion if Jane were to become queen. Edward died on 6 July 1553 and 16-year-old Jane, who fainted when she heard the news, was made queen on 10 July. However, despite the efforts of the Duke of Northumberland and Jane's father, the Duke of Suffolk, the public's support was with Lady Mary, the rightful heir according to Henry VIII's will. On 19 July Suffolk persuaded his daughter to relinquish the throne, which she had never wanted, to Mary. Mary's supporters joined her in a triumphal procession to London, accompanied by her younger sister Elizabeth. Lady Jane and her father were arrested for high treason and imprisoned in the Tower of London. Her father was pardoned, but his participation in Wyatt's rebellion led to his execution shortly after. Jane and her husband Lord Guildford were sentenced to death and beheaded on 12 February 1554. Jane was only 17 years old, and the cruel way in which her life had been lost for a throne she never desired aroused much sympathy among the public.\nMary I.\nMary soon announced her intention to marry the Spanish prince, Philip, son of her cousin Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. The prospect of a marriage alliance with Spain proved extremely unpopular with the English people, who were worried that Spain would use England as a satellite, involving England in wars without the popular support of the people. Popular discontent grew; a Protestant courtier, Thomas Wyatt the younger, led a rebellion against Mary aiming to depose and replace her with her half-sister Elizabeth. The plot was discovered, and Wyatt's supporters were hunted down and killed. Wyatt himself was tortured, in the hope that he would give evidence that Elizabeth was involved so that Mary could have her executed for treason. Wyatt refused to implicate Elizabeth, and he was beheaded in April 1554. Elizabeth spent two months imprisoned at the Tower of London, and then was placed under house arrest at Woodstock Palace for a year.\nMary married Philip at Winchester Cathedral, on 25 July 1554, and he thereby became king \"jure uxoris\" until her death. Philip found her unattractive, and only spent a minimal amount of time with her. Despite Mary believing she was pregnant numerous times during her five-year reign, she never bore children. Devastated that she rarely saw her husband, and anxious that she was not bearing an heir to Catholic England, Mary became bitter and resentful. In her determination to restore England to the Catholic faith and to secure her throne from Protestant threats, she had over 280 Protestants burnt at the stake in the Marian persecutions, between 1554 and 1558. Protestants came to hate her as \"Bloody Mary.\" Charles Dickens stated that \"as bloody Queen Mary this woman has become famous, and as Bloody Queen Mary she will ever be remembered with horror and detestation\".\nMary's dream of a new, Catholic Habsburg line was finished, and her popularity further declined when she lost Calais \u2014 the last English territory on French soil \u2014 to Francis, Duke of Guise, in January 1558. Mary's reign, however, introduced a new coining system that would be used until the 18th century, and her marriage to Philip II created new trade routes for England. Mary's government took a number of steps towards reversing the inflation, budgetary deficits, poverty, and trade crisis of her kingdom. She explored the commercial potential of Russian, African, and Baltic markets, revised the customs system, worked to counter the currency debasements of her predecessors, amalgamated several revenue courts, and strengthened the governing authority of the middling and larger towns. Mary also welcomed the first Russian ambassador to England, creating relations between England and Russia for the first time. Had she lived a little longer, Catholicism, which she worked so hard to restore into the realm, might have taken deeper roots than it did. However, her actions in pursuit of this goal arguably spurred on the Protestant cause, through the many people she killed. Mary died on 17 November 1558 at the age of 42.\nElizabeth I.\nElizabeth I, who was staying at Hatfield House at the time of her accession, rode to London to the cheers of both the ruling class and the common people.\nWhen Elizabeth came to the throne, there was much apprehension among members of the council appointed by Mary, because many of them (as noted by the Spanish ambassador) had participated in several plots against Elizabeth, such as her imprisonment in the Tower, trying to force her to marry a foreign prince and thereby sending her out of the realm, and even pushing for her death. In response to their fear, she chose as her chief minister William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, a Protestant, and former secretary to Lord Protector Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset and then to John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland. Under Mary, he had been spared, and often visited Elizabeth, ostensibly to review her accounts and expenditure. Elizabeth also appointed her personal favourite, the son of the Duke of Northumberland Robert Dudley, her Master of the Horse, giving him constant personal access to the queen.\nEarly years.\nElizabeth had a long, turbulent path to the throne. She had a number of problems during her childhood, the main one being after the execution of her mother, Anne Boleyn. When Anne was beheaded, Henry declared Elizabeth illegitimate and she would, therefore, not be able to inherit the throne. Henry returned her to the line of succession in the Third Succession Act of 1543. After the death of her father, she was raised by his widow, Catherine Parr and her new husband Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley. Seymour may have groomed and sexually abused her, but their relationship was seen instead as an affair and caused scandal. During the interrogations, she answered truthfully and boldly and all charges were dropped. Seymour, however, was executed on 20 March 1549. Elizabeth was an excellent student, well-schooled in Latin, French, Italian, and somewhat in Greek, and was a talented writer. She was supposedly a very skilled musician as well, in both singing and playing the lute. After the rebellion of Thomas Wyatt the Younger in 1554, Elizabeth was imprisoned in the Tower of London. No proof could be found that Elizabeth was involved and she was released and retired to the countryside until the death of her half-sister, Mary.\nImposing the Church of England.\nElizabeth was a moderate Protestant; she was the daughter of Anne Boleyn, who played a key role in the English Reformation in the 1520s. She had been brought up by Blanche Herbert Lady Troy. At her coronation in January 1559, many of the bishops \u2013 Catholic, appointed by Mary, who had expelled many of the Protestant clergymen when she became queen in 1553 \u2013 refused to perform the service in English. Eventually, the relatively minor Bishop of Carlisle, Owen Oglethorpe, performed the ceremony; but when Oglethorpe attempted to perform traditional Catholic parts of the coronation, Elizabeth got up and left. Following the coronation, two important acts were passed through Parliament: the Act of Uniformity 1558 and the Act of Supremacy 1558, establishing the Protestant Church of England and creating Elizabeth Supreme Governor of the Church of England (\"Supreme Head\", the title used by her father and brother, was seen as inappropriate for a woman ruler). These acts, known collectively as the Elizabethan Religious Settlement, made it compulsory to attend church services every Sunday; and imposed an oath on clergymen and statesmen to recognise the Church of England, the independence of the Church of England from the Catholic Church, and the authority of Elizabeth as Supreme Governor. Elizabeth made it clear that if they refused the oath the first time, they would have a second opportunity, after which, if the oath was not sworn, the offenders would be deprived of their offices and estates.\nPressure to marry.\nEven though Elizabeth was only twenty-five when she came to the throne, she was absolutely sure of her God-given place to be the queen and of her responsibilities as the 'handmaiden of the Lord'. She never let anyone challenge her authority as queen, even though many people, who felt she was weak and should be married, tried to do so. The popularity of Elizabeth was extremely high, but her Privy Council, her Parliament and her subjects thought that the unmarried queen should take a husband; it was generally accepted that, once a queen regnant was married, the husband would relieve the woman of the burdens of head of state. Also, without an heir, the Tudor line would end; the risk of civil war between rival claimants was a possibility if Elizabeth died childless. Numerous suitors from nearly all European nations sent ambassadors to English court to put forward their suit. Risk of death came dangerously close in 1564 when Elizabeth caught smallpox; when she was most at risk, she named Robert Dudley as Lord Protector in the event of her death. After her recovery, she appointed Dudley to the Privy Council and created him Earl of Leicester, in the hope that he would marry Mary, Queen of Scots. Mary rejected him, and instead married Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, a descendant of Henry VII, giving Mary a stronger claim to the English throne. Although many Catholics were loyal to Elizabeth, many also believed that, because Elizabeth was declared illegitimate after her parents' marriage was annulled, Mary was the strongest legitimate claimant. Despite this, Elizabeth would not name Mary her heir; as she had experienced during the reign of her predecessor Mary I, the opposition could flock around the heir if they were disheartened with Elizabeth's rule.\nNumerous threats to the Tudor line occurred during Elizabeth's reign. In 1569, a group of Earls led by Charles Neville, 6th Earl of Westmorland, and Thomas Percy, 7th Earl of Northumberland attempted to depose Elizabeth and replace her with Mary, Queen of Scots. In 1571, the Protestant-turned-Catholic Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, had plans to marry Mary, Queen of Scots, and then replace Elizabeth with Mary. The plot, masterminded by Roberto di Ridolfi, was discovered and Howard was beheaded. The next major uprising was in 1601, when Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, attempted to raise the city of London against Elizabeth's government. The city of London proved unwilling to rebel; Essex and most of his co-rebels were executed. Threats also came from abroad. In 1570, Pope Pius V issued a Papal bull, \"Regnans in Excelsis\", excommunicating Elizabeth, and releasing her subjects from their allegiance to her. Elizabeth came under pressure from Parliament to execute Mary, Queen of Scots, to prevent any further attempts to replace her; though faced with several official requests, she vacillated over the decision to execute an anointed queen. Finally, she was persuaded of Mary's (treasonous) complicity in the plotting against her, and she signed the death warrant in 1586. Mary was executed at Fotheringhay Castle on 8 February 1587, to the outrage of Catholic Europe.\nThere are many reasons debated as to why Elizabeth never married. It was rumoured that she was in love with Robert Dudley, and that on one of her summer progresses she had birthed his illegitimate child. This rumour was just one of many that swirled around the two's long-standing friendship. However, more important to focus on were the disasters that many women, such as her mother Anne Boleyn, suffered due to being married into the royal family. Her sister Mary's marriage to Philip brought great contempt to the country, for many of her subjects despised Spain and Philip and feared that he would try to take complete control. Recalling her father's disdain for Anne of Cleves, Elizabeth also refused to enter into a foreign match with a man that she had never seen before, so that also eliminated a large number of suitors.\nLast hopes for a Tudor heir.\nDespite the uncertainty of Elizabeth's \u2013 and therefore the Tudors' \u2013 hold on England, she never married. The closest she came to marriage was between 1579 and 1581, when she was courted by Francis, Duke of Anjou, the son of Henry II of France and Catherine de' Medici. Despite Elizabeth's government constantly begging her to marry in the early years of her reign, it was now persuading Elizabeth not to marry the French prince, for his mother, Catherine de' Medici, was suspected of ordering the St Bartholomew's Day massacre of tens of thousands of French Protestant Huguenots in 1572. Elizabeth bowed to public feeling against the marriage, learning from the mistake her sister, Mary I, made when she married Philip II of Spain, and sent the Duke of Anjou away.Elizabeth knew that the continuation of the Tudor line was now impossible; she was forty-eight in 1581, and too old to bear children.\nBy far the most dangerous threat to the Tudor line during Elizabeth's reign was the Spanish Armada of 1588, launched by Elizabeth's old suitor Philip II of Spain and commanded by Alonso de Guzm\u00e1n El Bueno, 7th Duke of Medina Sidonia. The Spanish invasion fleet outnumbered the English fleet's 22 galleons and 108 armed merchant ships. The Spanish lost, however, as a result of bad weather on the English Channel, poor planning and logistics, and the skills of Francis Drake and Charles Howard, 2nd Baron Howard of Effingham.\nMary, Queen of Scots was executed in 1587 after being implicated in Catholic plots against Elizabeth, which removed a Catholic alternative to her rule. Her death helped push Philip II to launch the Spanish Armada, which in 1588 was defeated by England's smaller, faster ships, the use of fireships, and bad weather. That summer at Tilbury, Elizabeth delivered her famous address; declaring she had \"the body of a weak and feeble woman\" but \"the heart and stomach of a king\", to rally the trained bands and strengthen her image as Gloriana.\nWhile Elizabeth declined physically with age, her running of the country continued to benefit her people. In response to famine across England due to bad harvests in the 1590s, Elizabeth introduced the poor law, allowing peasants who were too ill to work a certain amount of money from the state. All the money Elizabeth had borrowed from Parliament in 12 of the 13 parliamentary sessions was paid back; by the time of her death, Elizabeth not only had no debts, but was in credit. Elizabeth died childless at Richmond Palace on 24 March 1603. She left behind a legacy and monarchy worth noting. She had pursued her goals of being well endowed with every aspect of ruling her kingdom, and of knowing everything necessary to be an effective monarch. She took part in law, economics, politics and governmental issues both domestic and abroad. Realms that had once been strictly forbidden to the female gender had now been ruled by one.\nElizabeth never named a successor. However, her chief minister William Cecil had corresponded with the Protestant King James VI of Scotland, great-grandson of Margaret Tudor, and James's succession to the English throne was unopposed. There has been discussion over the selected heir. It has been argued that Elizabeth would have selected James because she felt guilty about what happened to his mother, her cousin. Whether this is true is unknown for certain, for Elizabeth did her best to never show emotion nor give in to claims. Elizabeth was strong and hard-headed and kept her primary goal in sight: providing the best for her people and proving those wrong who doubted her while maintaining a straight composure.\nThe House of Tudor survives through the female line, first with the House of Stuart, which occupied the English throne for most of the following century, and then the House of Hanover, via James' granddaughter Sophia. King Charles III, a member of the House of Windsor, is a direct descendant of Henry VII.\nRebellions against the Tudors.\nThe following English rebellions took place against the House of Tudor:\nTudor monarchs of England and Ireland.\nThe six Tudor monarchs were:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nArmorial.\nCoat of arms as sovereigns.\nAs Prince of Wales, Arthur, Henry, and Edward all bore these arms,\nTudor badges.\nThe Welsh Dragon supporter honoured the Tudors' Welsh origins. The most popular symbol of the house of Tudor was the Tudor rose (see top of page). When Henry Tudor took the crown of England from Richard III in battle, he brought about the end of the Wars of the Roses between the House of Lancaster (whose badge was a red rose) and the House of York (whose badge was a white rose). He married Elizabeth of York to bring all factions together.\nOn his marriage, Henry adopted the Tudor Rose badge conjoining the White Rose of York and the Red Rose of Lancaster. It symbolised the Tudor's right to rule as well the uniting of the kingdom after the Wars of the Roses. It has been used by every English, then British, monarch since Henry VII as a royal badge.\nTudor monograms.\nThe Tudors also used monograms to denote themselves:\nLineage and the Tudor name.\nThe Tudor name.\nAs noted above Tewdur or Tudor is derived from the words tud \"territory\" and rhi \"king\". Owen Tudor took it as a surname on being knighted. It is doubtful whether the Tudor kings used the name on the throne. Kings and princes were not seen as needing a name, and a \"Tudor\" name for the royal family was hardly known in the sixteenth century. The royal surname was never used in official publications, and hardly in 'histories' of various sorts before 1584. ... Monarchs were not anxious to publicise their descent in the paternal line from a Welsh adventurer, stressing instead continuity with the historic English and French royal families. Their subjects did not think of them as 'Tudors', or of themselves as 'Tudor people'\". Princes and Princesses would have been known as \"of England\". The medieval practice of colloquially calling princes after their place birth (e.g. Henry of Bolingbroke for Henry IV or Henry of Monmouth for Henry V) was not followed. Henry VII was likely known as \"Henry of Richmond\" before his taking of the throne. When Richard III called him \"Henry Tudor\" it was to stress his Welshness and his unfitness for the throne as opposed to himself, \"Richard Plantagenet\", a \"true\" descendant of the royal line.\nRoyal lineage.\nThe Tudors' claim to the throne combined the Lancastrian claim in their descent from the Beauforts and the Yorkist claim by the marriage of Henry VII to the heiress of Edward IV.\nIn popular culture.\nNumerous feature films are based on Tudor history. Queen Elizabeth I has been a particular favorite for filmmakers for generations. According to Elizabeth A. Ford and Deborah C. Mitchell, images of Elizabeth I move: \"fast-forward across film history, unforgettable, iconic images: the stately bearing; the red wigs; the high forehead; the long, aristocratic nose; the alabaster makeup; the pearl-drop earrings; the stiff, ornate ruffs; the fingers dripping with jewels; and the gowns, with yards and yards of white satin, purple velvet, gold, and silver ornamented and sparkling with rubies, diamonds, and more pearls. Even a schoolchild would be hard-pressed to mistake her for any other monarch.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31279", "revid": "2114166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31279", "title": "Typee", "text": "1846 book by Herman Melville\nTypee: A Peep at Polynesian Life is American writer Herman Melville's first book, published in 1846, when Melville was 26 years old. Considered a classic in travel and adventure literature, the narrative is based on Melville's experiences on the island Nuku Hiva in the South Pacific Marquesas Islands in 1842, supplemented with imaginative reconstruction and research from other books. The title comes from the valley of Taipivai, once known as Taipi.\n\"Typee\" was Melville's most popular work during his lifetime; it made him notorious as the \"man who lived among the cannibals\".\nBackground.\nFrom the beginning there were questions about Melville's romantic tale. The London publisher John Murray wanted reassurance that Melville's experiences were first-hand before he included the book in the \"Home and Colonial Library\" series, which was nonfiction by or about foreigners in exotic places. Warm but sometimes skeptical reviews also challenged Melville's account.\nNot long after the book's publication, however, many of the events described were corroborated by Melville's fellow castaway, Richard Tobias Greene (\"Toby\"). Researchers later discovered an affidavit from the ship's captain that corroborated that Melville and Greene did indeed desert the ship on the island in the summer of 1842.\n\"Typee\" can be seen as a kind of proto-anthropology. Melville continually admits vast ignorance of the culture and language he is describing while also trying to bolster and supplement his own experiences with wide reading and research. He also employs hyperbole and humor. Starting in the 1930s, scholars in the Melville revival questioned Melville's account. For instance, the length of stay on which \"Typee\" is based is presented as four months, and this was an exaggeration of Melville's actual stay on the island. There is also not a lake where Melville might have gone canoeing with Fayaway.\nTo flesh out his narrative, Melville used several source books from which he took passages and rewrote them. The most important of these source books are William Ellis, \"Polynesian Researches\" from 1833, George H. von Langsdorff, \"Voyages and Travels in Various Parts of the World\" from 1813, David Porter, \"Journal of a Cruise Made to the Pacific Ocean in the U.S. Frigate Essex\" from 1815, and Charles S. Stewart, \"A Visit to the South Seas in the U.S. ship Vincennes\" from 1831.\nCritical response.\n\"Typee\"'s narrative expresses a great deal of sympathy for the so-called savages, and even interrogates the use of that word, while focusing the most criticism on European marauders and various missionaries' attempts to evangelize:\nIt may be asserted without fear of contradictions that in all the cases of\noutrages committed by Polynesians, Europeans have at some time or\nother been the aggressors, and that the cruel and bloodthirsty\ndisposition of some of the islanders is mainly to be ascribed to\nthe influence of such examples.\n[The] voluptuous Indian, with every desire supplied,\nwhom Providence has bountifully provided with all the sources of\npure and natural enjoyment, and from whom are removed so many of\nthe ills and pains of life\u2014what has he to desire at the hands of\nCivilization? Will he be the happier? Let the once smiling and\npopulous Hawaiian islands, with their now diseased, starving, and\ndying natives, answer the question. The missionaries may seek to\ndisguise the matter as they will, but the facts are incontrovertible.\nCH 4\n\"The Knickerbocker\" called \"Typee\" \"a piece of M\u00fcnchhausenism.\" New York publisher Evert Augustus Duyckinck wrote to Nathaniel Hawthorne that \"it is a lively and pleasant book, not over philosophical perhaps.\" In 1939, Charles Robert Anderson published \"Melville in the South Seas\", in which he elaborated on a number of Melville's likely sources in supplementing his work and also documented the existence of an affidavit from the captain of the \"Acushnet\". If the date provided by the captain can be considered accurate, Anderson concludes that Melville's stay in the \"Typee Valley\" part of the island would have been merely \"four weeks, or possible eight weeks at the most.\" However, in trying to determine the end date of Melville's stay, Anderson relies primarily on Melville's own internal accounts of various events, for instance that he was rescued from the valley on a \"Monday.\" In summing up his view of \"Typee\", Anderson writes:\n For the general student of Melville, the detailed analysis and verification of these matters ... probably reveals an accuracy scarcely to be expected. Without hesitation it can be said that in general this volume presents a faithful delineation of the island life and scenery in precivilization Nukahiva, with the exception of numerous embellishments and some minor errors...\nAll of the initial back and forth that Melville experienced regarding the factuality of \"Typee\" may have had a chastening effect on him, as Anderson considers his next work, the book's sequel \"Omoo\", \"the most strictly autobiographical of all Melville's works.\" But this second book also seems to have met with some skepticism, so that for his third book \"Mardi\", Melville declares in the preface that he has decided to write a work of fiction under the supposition (half-joking) he might finally be believed: \nNot long ago, having published two narratives of voyages in the Pacific, which, in many quarters, were received with incredulity, the thought occurred to me, of indeed writing a romance of Polynesian adventure, and publishing it as such; to see whether, the fiction might not, possibly be received for a verity: in some degree the reverse of my previous experience.\nAcademic analysis.\nLawrence Buell suggested that \"Typee\" has interesting textual and metatextual elements implying that Melville was aiming for trans-Atlantic audiences. Buell specifically identifies Melville's portrayal of indigenous Polynesian religions as appealing on the one hand to assuage British concern for \"veracity\" in their reading and on the other skewering American \"religious excess.\"\nIn the linguistics field, \"Typee\" is one of the few existing literature that shows examples of Maritime Polynesian Pidgin, a kind of zonal auxiliary language used by Euro-American sailors and whalers including of Melville's background in communicating with Polynesians and their very related, almost mutally intelligible languages following the first contact with James Cook in the late 1760s until later supplanted with European languages taught in colonial schools there.\nPublication history.\n\"Typee\" was published first in London by John Murray on February 26, 1846, and then in New York by Wiley and Putnam on March 17, 1846. It was Melville's first book, and made him one of the best-known American authors overnight.\nThe same version was published in London and New York in the first edition; however, Melville removed critical references to missionaries and Christianity from the second U.S. edition at the request of his American publisher. Later additions included a \"Sequel: The Story of Toby\" written by Melville, explaining what happened to Toby.\nBefore \"Typee\"'s publication in New York, Wiley and Putnam asked Melville to remove one sentence. In a scene in Chapter Two where the \"Dolly\" is boarded by young women from Nukuheva, Melville originally wrote:\nOur ship was now given up to every species of riot and debauchery. Not the feeblest barrier was interposed between the unholy passions of the crew and their unlimited gratification. \nThe second sentence was removed from the final version.\nThe discovery in 1983 of thirty more pages from Melville\u2019s working draft manuscript led Melville scholar John Bryant to challenge earlier conclusions about Melville's writing habits. He describes the versions of the draft manuscript and of the \u201cradically different physical print versions of the book,\u201d which amount, Bryant concludes, to \u201cone grand, hooded mess.\u201d Since there is no clear way to present Melville\u2019s \"final intention,\" his 2008 book offers a \u201cfluid text\u201d that allows a reader to follow the revisions. made what he called \u201can exciting new perspective on Melville\u2019s writing process and culture.\u201d \nThe inaugural book of the Library of America series, titled \"Typee, Omoo, Mardi\" (May 6, 1982), was a volume containing \"Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life\", its sequel \"Omoo: A Narrative of Adventures in the South Seas\" (1847), and \"Mardi, and a Voyage Thither\" (1849).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Intuitively, it may be regarded as footballs (or soccer balls) that are typically patterned with white hexagons and black pentagons. Geodesic dome structures such as those whose architecture Buckminster Fuller pioneered are often based on this structure. It is an example of an Archimedean solid, as well as a Goldberg polyhedron.\nConstruction.\nThe truncated icosahedron can be constructed from a regular icosahedron by cutting off all of its vertices, known as truncation. Each of the 12 vertices at the one-third mark of each edge creates 12 pentagonal faces and transforms the original 20 triangle faces into regular hexagons. Therefore, the resulting polyhedron has 32 faces, 90 edges, and 60 vertices. A Goldberg polyhedron is one whose faces are 12 pentagons and some multiple of 10 hexagons. There are three classes of Goldberg polyhedron, one of them is constructed by truncating all vertices repeatedly, and the truncated icosahedron is one of them, denoted as formula_1.\nProperties.\nThe surface area formula_2 and the volume formula_3 of the truncated icosahedron of edge length formula_4 are:\nformula_5\nThe sphericity of a polyhedron formula_6 describes how closely a polyhedron resembles a sphere. It can be defined as the ratio of the surface area of a sphere with the same volume to the polyhedron's surface area, from which the value is between 0 and 1. In the case of a truncated icosahedron, it is:\nformula_7\nThe dihedral angle of a truncated icosahedron between adjacent hexagonal faces is approximately 138.18\u00b0, and that between pentagon-to-hexagon is approximately 142.6\u00b0.\nThe truncated icosahedron is an Archimedean solid, meaning it is a highly symmetric and semi-regular polyhedron, and two or more different regular polygonal faces meet in a vertex. It has the same symmetry as the regular icosahedron, the icosahedral symmetry, and it also has the property of vertex-transitivity. The polygonal faces that meet for every vertex are one pentagon and two hexagons, and the vertex figure of a truncated icosahedron is formula_8. The truncated icosahedron's dual is pentakis dodecahedron, a Catalan solid, shares the same symmetry as the truncated icosahedron.\nTruncated icosahedral graph.\nAccording to Steinitz's theorem, the skeleton of a truncated icosahedron, like that of any convex polyhedron, can be represented as a polyhedral graph, meaning a planar graph (one that can be drawn without crossing edges) and 3-vertex-connected graph (remaining connected whenever two of its vertices are removed). The graph is known as truncated icosahedral graph, and it has 60 vertices and 90 edges. It is an Archimedean graph because it resembles one of the Archimedean solids. It is a cubic graph, meaning that each vertex is incident to exactly three edges.\nAppearance.\nThe balls used in association football and team handball are perhaps the best-known example of a spherical polyhedron analog to the truncated icosahedron, found in everyday life. The ball comprises the same pattern of regular pentagons and regular hexagons, each of which is painted in black and white, respectively; still, its shape is more spherical. It was introduced by Adidas, which debuted the Telstar ball during the World Cup in 1970. However, it was superseded in 2006.\nGeodesic domes are typically based on triangular facetings of this geometry, with example structures found across the world, popularized by Buckminster Fuller. An example can be found in the model of a buckminsterfullerene or buckyball, a truncated icosahedron-shaped geodesic dome allotrope of elemental carbon discovered in 1985. In other engineering and science applications, its shape was also the configuration of the lenses used for focusing the explosive shock waves of the detonators in both the gadget and Fat Man atomic bombs. Its structure can also be found in the protein of clathrin.\nThe truncated icosahedron was known to Archimedes, who classified the 13 Archimedean solids in a lost work. All that is now known of his work on these shapes comes from Pappus of Alexandria, who merely lists the numbers of faces for each: 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons, in the case of the truncated icosahedron. The first known image and complete description of a truncated icosahedron are from a rediscovery by Piero della Francesca, in his 15th-century book \"De quinque corporibus regularibus\", which included five of the Archimedean solids (the five truncations of the regular polyhedra). The same shape was depicted by Leonardo da Vinci, in his illustrations for Luca Pacioli's plagiarism of della Francesca's book in 1509. Although Albrecht D\u00fcrer omitted this shape from the other Archimedean solids listed in his 1525 book on polyhedra, \"Underweysung der Messung\", a description of it was found in his posthumous papers, published in 1538. Johannes Kepler later rediscovered the complete list of the 13 Archimedean solids, including the truncated icosahedron, and included them in his 1609 book, \"Harmonices Mundi\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31283", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31283", "title": "The Mismeasure of Man", "text": "1981 book by Stephen Jay Gould\nThe Mismeasure of Man is a 1981 book by paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould. The book is both a history and critique of the statistical methods and cultural motivations underlying biological determinism, the belief that \"the social and economic differences between human groups\u2014primarily races, classes, and sexes\u2014arise from inherited, inborn distinctions and that society, in this sense, is an accurate reflection of biology\".\nGould argues that the primary assumption underlying biological determinism is that \"worth can be assigned to individuals and groups by \"measuring intelligence as a single quantity\"\". Biological determinism is analyzed in discussions of craniometry and psychological testing, the two principal methods used to measure intelligence as a single quantity. According to Gould, these methods possess two deep fallacies. The first fallacy is reification, which is \"our tendency to convert abstract concepts into entities\". Examples of reification include the intelligence quotient (IQ) and the general intelligence factor (\"g\" factor), which have been the cornerstones of much research into human intelligence. The second fallacy is that of \"ranking\", which is the \"propensity for ordering complex variation as a gradual ascending scale\".\nThe book received many positive reviews in the literary and popular press, while scientific reception was highly polarized. Positive reviews focused on the book's critique of scientific racism, the concept of general intelligence, and biological determinism, while critics accused Gould of historical inaccuracy, unclear reasoning, or political bias. \"The Mismeasure of Man\" won the National Book Critics Circle award. Gould's findings about how 19th-century researcher Samuel George Morton measured skull volumes were particularly controversial, inspiring several studies debating his claims. \nIn 1996, a second edition was released. It included two additional chapters critiquing Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray's book \"The Bell Curve\" (1994).\nAuthor.\nStephen Jay Gould (; 1941 \u2013 2002) was a professor at Harvard, teaching paleontology, evolutionary biology, and the history of science. An active and prodigious author, Gould's work was frequently cited by colleagues, being both influential and sometimes polarizing. He was also among the best selling authors of popular science, with a broad global readership. As in \"The Mismeasure of Man\", throughout his writings Gould regularly criticized biologically determined explanations for human behavior, as seen in his \"Against \"Sociobiology\"\" (1975) and \"The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm\" (1979).\nSummary.\nCraniometry.\n\"The Mismeasure of Man\" is a critical analysis of the early works of scientific racism which promoted \"the theory of\nunitary, innate, linearly rankable intelligence\"\u2014such as craniometry, the measurement of skull volume and its relation to intellectual faculties. Gould alleged that much of the research was based largely on racial and social prejudices of the researchers rather than their scientific objectivity; that on occasion, researchers such as Samuel George Morton (1799\u20131851), Louis Agassiz (1807\u20131873), and Paul Broca (1824\u20131880), committed the methodological fallacy of allowing their personal \"a priori\" expectations to influence their conclusions and analytical reasoning. Gould noted that when Morton switched from using bird seed, which was less reliable, to lead shot to obtain endocranial-volume data, the average skull volumes changed; however, these changes were not uniform across Morton's \"racial\" groupings. To Gould, it appeared that unconscious bias influenced Morton's initial results. Gould speculated,\nPlausible scenarios are easy to construct. Morton, measuring by seed, picks up a threateningly large black skull, fills it lightly and gives it a few desultory shakes. Next, he takes a distressingly small Caucasian skull, shakes hard, and pushes mightily at the foramen magnum with his thumb. It is easily done, without conscious motivation; expectation is a powerful guide to action.\nIn 1977 Gould conducted his own analysis on some of Morton's endocranial-volume data, and alleged that the original results were based on \"a priori\" convictions and a selective use of data. He argued that when biases are accounted for, the original hypothesis\u2014an ascending order of skull volume ranging from Blacks to Mongols to Whites\u2014is unsupported by the data.\nBias and falsification.\n\"The Mismeasure of Man\" presents a historical evaluation of the concepts of the \"intelligence quotient\" (IQ) and of the \"general intelligence factor\" (\"g\" factor), which were and are the measures for intelligence used by psychologists. Gould proposed that most psychological studies have been heavily biased, by the belief that the human behavior of a race of people is best explained by genetic heredity. He cites the Burt Affair, about the oft-cited twin studies, by Cyril Burt (1883\u20131971), wherein Burt claimed that human intelligence is highly heritable.\nIQ, \"g\", statistical correlation, and heritability.\nAs an evolutionary biologist and historian of science, Gould accepted \"biological variability\" (the premise of the transmission of intelligence via genetic heredity), but opposed \"biological determinism\", which posits that genes determine a definitive, unalterable social destiny for each man and each woman in life and society. \"The Mismeasure of Man\" is an analysis of statistical correlation, the mathematics applied by psychologists to establish the validity of IQ tests, and the heritability of intelligence. For example, to establish the validity of the proposition that IQ is supported by a general intelligence factor (\"g\" factor), the answers to several tests of cognitive ability must positively correlate; thus, for the \"g\" factor to be a heritable trait, the IQ-test scores of close-relation respondents must correlate more than the IQ-test scores of distant-relation respondents. However, correlation does not imply causation; for example, Gould said that the measures of the changes, over time, in \"my age, the population of M\u00e9xico, the price of Swiss cheese, my pet turtle's weight, and the average distance between galaxies\" have a high, positive correlation\u2014yet that correlation does not indicate that Gould's age increased because the Mexican population increased. More specifically, a high, positive correlation between the intelligence quotients of a parent and a child can be presumed either as evidence that IQ is genetically inherited, or that IQ is inherited through social and environmental factors. Moreover, because the data from IQ tests can be applied to arguing the logical validity of either proposition\u2014genetic inheritance and environmental inheritance\u2014the psychometric data have no inherent value.\nGould pointed out that if the genetic heritability of IQ were demonstrable within a given racial or ethnic group, it would not explain the causes of IQ differences among the people of a group, or if said IQ differences can be attributed to the environment. For example, the height of a person is genetically determined, but there exist height differences within a given social group that can be attributed to environmental factors (e.g. the quality of nutrition) and to genetic inheritance. The evolutionary biologist Richard Lewontin, a colleague of Gould's, is a proponent of this argument in relation to IQ tests. An example of the intellectual confusion about what heritability is and is not, is the statement: \"If all environments were to become equal for everyone, heritability would rise to 100 percent because all remaining differences in IQ would necessarily be genetic in origin\", which Gould said is misleading, at best, and false, at worst. First, it is very difficult to conceive of a world wherein every man, woman, and child grew up in the same environment, because their spatial and temporal dispersion upon the planet Earth makes it impossible. Second, were people to grow up in the same environment, not every difference would be genetic in origin because of the randomness of molecular and genetic development. Therefore, heritability is not a measure of phenotypic (physiognomy and physique) differences among racial and ethnic groups, but of differences between genotype and phenotype in a given population.\nFurthermore, he dismissed the proposition that an IQ score measures the general intelligence (\"g\" factor) of a person, because cognitive ability tests (IQ tests) present different types of questions, and the responses tend to form clusters of intellectual acumen. That is, different questions, and the answers to them, yield different scores\u2014which indicate that an IQ test is a combination method of different examinations of different things. As such, Gould proposed that IQ-test proponents assume the existence of \"general intelligence\" as a discrete quality within the human mind, and thus they analyze the IQ-test data to produce an IQ number that establishes the definitive general intelligence of each man and of each woman. Hence, Gould dismissed the IQ number as an erroneous artifact of the statistical mathematics applied to the raw IQ-test data, especially because psychometric data can be variously analyzed to produce multiple IQ scores.\nSecond edition.\nThe revised and expanded second edition (1996) includes two additional chapters, which critique Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray's book \"The Bell Curve\" (1994). Gould maintains that their book contains no new arguments and presents no compelling data; it merely refashions earlier arguments for biological determinism, which Gould defines as \"the abstraction of intelligence as a single entity, its location within the brain, its quantification as one number for each individual, and the use of these numbers to rank people in a single series of worthiness, invariably to find that oppressed and disadvantaged groups\u2014races, classes, or sexes\u2014are innately inferior and deserve their status\".\nReception.\nPraise.\nThe majority of reviews of \"The Mismeasure of Man\" were positive, as Gould notes. Richard Lewontin, a celebrated evolutionary biologist who held positions at both the University of Chicago and Harvard, wrote a glowing review of Gould's book in \"The New York Review of Books\", endorsing most aspects of its account, and suggesting that it might have been even more critical of the racist intentions of the scientists he discusses, because scientists \"sometimes tell deliberate lies because they believe that small lies can serve big truths.\" Gould said that the most positive review of the first edition to be written by a psychologist was in the \"British Journal of Mathematical &amp; Statistical Psychology\", which reported that \"Gould has performed a valuable service in exposing the logical basis of one of the most important debates in the social sciences, and this book should be required reading for students and practitioners alike.\" In \"The New York Times\", journalist Christopher Lehmann-Haupt wrote that the critique of factor analysis \"demonstrates persuasively how factor analysis led to the cardinal error in reasoning, of confusing correlation with cause, or, to put it another way, of attributing false concreteness to the abstract\". The British journal \"Saturday Review\" praised the book as a \"fascinating historical study of scientific racism\", and that its arguments \"illustrate both the logical inconsistencies of the theories and the prejudicially motivated, albeit unintentional, misuse of data in each case\". In the American \"Monthly Review\" magazine, Richard York and the sociologist Brett Clark praised the book's thematic concentration, saying that \"rather than attempt a grand critique of all 'scientific' efforts aimed at justifying social inequalities, Gould performs a well-reasoned assessment of the errors underlying a specific set of theories and empirical claims\". \"Newsweek\" gave it a positive review for revealing biased science and its abuse. \"The Atlantic Monthly\" and Phi Beta Kappa's \"The Key Reporter\" also reviewed the book favorably.\nAwards.\nThe first edition of \"The Mismeasure of Man\" won the non-fiction award from the National Book Critics Circle; the Outstanding Book Award for 1983 from the American Educational Research Association; the Italian translation was awarded the \"Iglesias\" prize in 1991; and in 1998, the Modern Library ranked it as the 24th-best English-language non-fiction book of the 20th century. In December 2006, \"Discover\" magazine ranked \"The Mismeasure of Man\" as the 17th-greatest science book of all time.\nReassessing Morton's skull measurements.\nIn a paper published in 1988, John S. Michael reported that Samuel G. Morton's original 19th-century study was conducted with less bias than Gould had described; that \"contrary to Gould's interpretation ... Morton's research was conducted with integrity\". Nonetheless, Michael's analysis suggested that there were discrepancies in Morton's craniometric calculations, that his data tables were scientifically unsound, and he \"cannot be excused for his errors, or his unfair comparisons of means\". Michael later complained that some authors, including J. Philippe Rushton, selectively \"cherry-picked facts\" from his research to support their own claims. He lamented, \"Some people have turned the Morton-Gould affair into an all or nothing debate in which either one side is right or the other side is right, and I think that is a mistake. Both men made mistakes and proving one wrong does not prove the other one right.\"\nIn another study, published in 2011, Jason E. Lewis and colleagues re-measured the cranial volumes of the skulls in Morton's collection, and re-examined the respective statistical analyses by Morton and by Gould, concluding that, contrary to Gould's analysis, Morton did not falsify craniometric research results to support his racial and social prejudices, and that the \"Caucasians\" possessed the greatest average cranial volume in the sample. To the extent that Morton's craniometric measurements were erroneous, the error was away from his personal biases. Ultimately, Lewis and colleagues disagreed with most of Gould's criticisms of Morton, finding that Gould's work was \"poorly supported\", and that, in their opinion, the confirmation of the results of Morton's original work \"weakens the argument of Gould, and others, that biased results are endemic in science\". Despite this criticism, the authors acknowledged that they admired Gould's staunch opposition to racism. Lewis' study examined 46% of Morton's samples, whereas Gould's earlier study was based solely on a reexamination of Morton's raw data tables. However Lewis' study was subsequently criticized by a number of scholars for misrepresenting Gould's claims, bias, faulted for examining fewer than half of the skulls in Morton's collection, for failing to correct measurements for age, gender or stature, and for its claim that any meaningful conclusions could be drawn from Morton's data.\nIn 2015 this paper was reviewed by Michael Weisberg, who reported that \"most of Gould's arguments against Morton are sound. Although Gould made some errors and overstated his case in a number of places, he provided \"prima facie\" evidence, as yet unrefuted, that Morton did indeed mismeasure his skulls in ways that conformed to 19th century racial biases\". Biologists and philosophers Jonathan Kaplan, Massimo Pigliucci, and Joshua Alexander Banta also published a critique of the group's paper, arguing that many of its claims were misleading and the re-measurements were \"completely irrelevant to an evaluation of Gould's published analysis\". They also maintain that the \"methods deployed by Morton and Gould were both inappropriate\" and that \"Gould's statistical analysis of Morton's data is in many ways no better than Morton's own\".\nA 2018 paper argued that Morton's interpretation of the data was biased but that the data itself was accurate. The paper argued that Morton's measurements were similar to those of a contemporary craniologist, Friedrich Tiedemann, who had interpreted the data differently to argue strongly against any conception of racial hierarchy.\nCriticism.\nIn a review of \"The Mismeasure of Man\", Bernard Davis, professor of microbiology at Harvard Medical School, said that Gould erected a straw man argument based upon incorrectly defined key terms\u2014specifically \"reification\"\u2014which Gould furthered with a \"highly selective\" presentation of statistical data, all motivated more by politics than by science. Davis said that Philip Morrison's laudatory book review of \"The Mismeasure of Man\" in \"Scientific American\" was written and published because the editors of the journal had \"long seen the study of the genetics of intelligence as a threat to social justice\". Davis also criticized the popular-press and the literary-journal book reviews of \"The Mismeasure of Man\" as generally approbatory; whereas, he said that most scientific-journal book reviews were generally critical. Davis accused Gould of having misrepresented a study by Henry H. Goddard (1866\u20131957) about the intelligence of Jewish, Hungarian, Italian, and Russian immigrants to the U.S., wherein Gould reported Goddard's qualifying those people as \"feeble-minded\"; whereas, in the initial sentence of the study, Goddard said the study subjects were atypical members of their ethnic groups, who had been selected because of their suspected sub-normal intelligence. Davis also argued that Goddard had proposed that the low IQs of the sub-normally intelligent men and women who took the cognitive-ability test likely derived from their social environments rather than from their respective genetic inheritances, and concluded that \"we may be confident that their children will be of average intelligence, and, if rightly brought up, will be good citizens\". Gould pushed back against some of Davis' claims in a 1994 revised edition of the book. While Davis characterized the book's reception as negative in the scientific journals, Gould argued that of twenty-four academic book reviews written by experts in psychology, fourteen approved, three were mixed opinions, and seven disapproved of the book.\nIn his review, psychologist John B. Carroll said that Gould did not understand \"the nature and purpose\" of factor analysis. Statistician David J. Bartholomew, of the London School of Economics, said that Gould erred in his use of factor analysis, irrelevantly concentrated upon the fallacy of reification (abstract as concrete), and ignored the contemporary scientific consensus about the existence of the psychometric \"g\".\nReviewing the book, Stephen F. Blinkhorn, a senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Hertfordshire, wrote that \"The Mismeasure of Man\" was \"a masterpiece of propaganda\" that selectively juxtaposed data to further a political agenda. Psychologist Lloyd Humphreys, then editor-in-chief of \"The American Journal of Psychology\" and \"Psychological Bulletin\", wrote that \"The Mismeasure of Man\" was \"science fiction\" and \"political propaganda\", and that Gould had misrepresented the views of Alfred Binet, Godfrey Thomson, and Lewis Terman.\nIn his review, psychologist Franz Samelson wrote that Gould was wrong in asserting that the psychometric results of the intelligence tests administered to soldier-recruits by the U.S. Army contributed to the legislation of the Immigration Restriction Act of 1924. In their study of the Congressional Record and committee hearings related to the Immigration Act, Mark Snyderman and Richard J. Herrnstein reported that \"the [intelligence] testing community did not generally view its findings as favoring restrictive immigration policies like those in the 1924 Act, and Congress took virtually no notice of intelligence testing\". Psychologist David P. Barash wrote that Gould unfairly groups sociobiology with \"racist eugenics and misguided Social Darwinism\".\nA 2019 paper argued that the Gould was incorrect in his assessment of the Army Beta and that, for the knowledge, technology and test development standards of the time, it was adequate and could measure intelligence, possibly even in the modern day.\nResponses by subjects of the book.\nIn his review of \"The Mismeasure of Man\", Arthur Jensen, a University of California (Berkeley) educational psychologist whom Gould much criticized in the book, wrote that Gould used straw man arguments to advance his opinions, misrepresented other scientists, and propounded a political agenda. According to Jensen, the book was \"a patent example\" of the bias that political ideology imposes upon science\u2014the very thing that Gould sought to portray in the book. Jensen also criticized Gould for concentrating on long-disproven arguments (noting that 71% of the book's references preceded 1950), rather than addressing \"anything currently regarded as important by scientists in the relevant fields\", suggesting that drawing conclusions from early human intelligence research is like condemning the contemporary automobile industry based upon the mechanical performance of the Ford Model T.\nCharles Murray, co-author of \"The Bell Curve\" (1994), said that his views about the distribution of human intelligence, among the races and the ethnic groups who compose the U.S. population, were misrepresented in \"The Mismeasure of Man\".\nPsychologist Hans Eysenck wrote that \"The Mismeasure of Man\" is a book that presents \"a paleontologist's distorted view of what psychologists think, untutored in even the most elementary facts of the science\".\nResponses to the second edition (1996).\nArthur Jensen and Bernard Davis argued that if the \"g\" factor (general intelligence factor) were replaced with a model that tested several types of intelligence, it would change results less than one might expect. Therefore, according to Jensen and Davis, the results of standardized tests of cognitive ability would continue to correlate with the results of other such standardized tests, and that the intellectual achievement gap between black and white people would remain.\nJames R. Flynn, a researcher critical of racial theories of intelligence, repeated the arguments of Arthur Jensen about the second edition of \"The Mismeasure of Man\". Flynn wrote that \"Gould's book evades all of Jensen's best arguments for a genetic component in the black\u2013white IQ gap, by positing that they are dependent on the concept of \"g\" as a general intelligence factor. Therefore, Gould believes that if he can discredit \"g\" no more need be said. This is manifestly false. Jensen's arguments would bite no matter whether blacks suffered from a score deficit on one or ten or one hundred factors.\" Rather than defending Jensen and Rushton, however, Flynn concluded that the Flynn Effect, a nongenetic rise in IQ throughout the 20th century, invalidated their core argument because their methods falsely identified even this change as genetic.\nAccording to psychologist Ian Deary, Gould's claim that there is no relation between brain size and IQ is outdated. Furthermore, he reported that Gould refused to correct this in new editions of the book, even though newly available data were brought to his attention by several researchers.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Human rights groups and the United Nations (UN) have been critical of the group's treatment of women. The UN has said that the Taliban's policy of strict separation of men and women may amount to gender apartheid.\nDuring their first rule of Afghanistan, the Taliban were notorious internationally for their misogyny and violence against women. In 1996, women were mandated to wear the burqa at all times in public. Women were not allowed to work, nor continue their education beyond the age of eight. Women seeking an education were forced to attend underground schools, where they and their teachers risked execution if caught. Women could not be treated by male doctors unless accompanied by a male chaperone, a barrier which deterred women from seeking healthcare, for many leading to untreated illness and/or further health complications. The Taliban enforced these laws through public flogging and execution.\nAfter retaking control of Afghanistan in 2021, the Taliban initially granted women permission to attend universities, albeit in gender segregated classrooms, on the condition that they followed \"Islamic standards\". However, shortly after, the group expanded the restriction to prohibit girls from going to school beyond the age of 12 \u2014 the only restriction of its kind in the world. Additionally, they have prohibited women in Afghanistan from working in most sectors; there are limited exceptions for healthcare and education, though the Taliban's restrictions have proven prohibitively cumbersome for many women in these fields. Some provinces still allow secondary education for girls, despite the nationwide ban. Women are mandated to wear face coverings in public and barred from travelling more than without a close male relative. In 2022, Hibatullah Akhundzada, the Taliban's reclusive leader, rejected international criticism and demands to ease human rights restrictions, refusing any negotiations or compromises on the Taliban's governance. Within two years after seizing Afghanistan, the Taliban shut down beauty salons and banned women from accessing gyms and parks. These restrictions have faced near-universal condemnation, including from Islamic governments and clerics in and outside Afghanistan who say the restrictions have no basis in Islam.\nLaws.\nFrom the age of eight onward, girls in Afghanistan were not allowed to be in direct contact with males other than a close \"blood relative\", husband, or in-law \"(see mahram)\". From September 1996 to December 2001, when the Taliban were in control of 90 percent of Afghanistan, it imposed the following restrictions on women:\nMobility.\nThe Taliban rulings regarding public conduct placed severe restrictions on a woman's freedom of movement and created difficulties for those who could not afford a burqa (which was not commonly worn in Afghanistan prior to the rise of the Taliban and considered a fairly expensive garment at upwards of US$\u00a0in 1998) or did not have any \"mahram\". These women faced virtual house arrest. In December 1998, a decree issued by the Ministry for the promotion of Virtue and prevention of Vice banned taxi drivers from transporting women who did not completely cover their faces. A woman who was badly beaten by the Taliban for walking the streets alone stated \"my father was killed in battle\u00a0... I have no husband, no brother, no son. How am I to live if I can't go out alone?\" \nA field worker for the NGO Terre des hommes witnessed the impact on female mobility at Kabul's largest state-run orphanage, Taskia Maskan. After the female staff were relieved of their duties, the approximately 400 girls living at the institution were locked inside for a year without being allowed outside for recreation.\nDecrees that affected women's mobility were:\nThe lives of rural women were less dramatically affected as they generally lived and worked within secure kin environments. A relative level of freedom was necessary for them to continue with their chores or labour. If these women travelled to a nearby town, the same urban restrictions would have applied to them.\nEmployment.\nThe Taliban disagreed with past Afghan statutes that allowed the employment of Afghan women in a mixed sex workplace. The claim was that this was a breach of purdah and Sharia law. On 30 September 1996, the Taliban decreed that all women should be banned from employment. It is estimated that 25 per cent of government employees were female, and when compounded by losses in other sectors, many thousands of women were affected.\nAnother loss was for those whom the employed women served. Elementary education of all children, not just girls, was shut down in Kabul, where virtually all of the elementary school teachers were women. Thousands of educated families fled Kabul for Pakistan after the Taliban took the city in 1996. \nBetween April and June 1998, the United Nations left their offices in Qandahar following disagreements over a regulation which demanded the female staff to only operate accompanied by a \"mahram\". The two parties later came to an agreement over the working conditions, but the Taliban demanded the agreement to be kept secret. However, most expatriate staff including the staff of the UN left Afghanistan following the death of a UN official in August 1998. \nTaliban Supreme Leader Mohammed Omar assured female civil servants and teachers they would still receive wages of around US$5 per month, although this was a short-term offering. A Taliban representative stated: \"The Taliban's act of giving monthly salaries to 30,000 job-free women, now sitting comfortably at home, is a whiplash in the face of those who are defaming Taliban with reference to the rights of women. These people through baseless propaganda are trying to incite the women of Kabul against the Taliban\". A Taliban official mentioned in 1998 that in the Quran it says \"stay at home\" (in the feminine form), therefore there is not much to do other than to obey.\nThe Taliban promoted the use of the extended family, or zakat system of charity to ensure women should not need to work. However, years of conflict meant that nuclear families often struggled to support themselves let alone aid additional relatives. Qualification for legislation often rested on men, such as food aid, which had to be collected by a male relative. The possibility that a woman may not possess any living male relatives was dismissed by Mullah Ghaus, the acting foreign minister, who said he was surprised at the degree of international attention and concern for such a small percentage of the Afghan population. A Physicians for Human Rights researcher that travelled to Kabul in 1998 described \"a city of beggars\" filled with \"women who had once been teachers and nurses now moving in the streets like ghosts under their enveloping \"burqas\", selling every possession and begging so as to feed their children.\"\nFemale health professionals could be exempt from the employment ban, yet they operated in much-reduced freedom of movement. The ordeal of physically getting to work due to the segregated bus system and widespread harassment meant some women left their jobs by choice. Of those who remained, many lived in fear of the regime and chose to reside at hospitals during the working week to minimise exposure to Taliban forces. These women were vital to ensuring the continuance of gynaecological, ante-natal, and midwifery services, but it was on a much compromised level. Under the Rabbani regime, there had been around 200 female staff working in Kabul's Mullalai Hospital, yet barely 50 remained under the Taliban. NGOs operating in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban in 2001 found the shortage of female health professionals to be a significant obstacle to their work.\nThe other exception to the employment ban allowed a reduced number of humanitarian workers to remain in service. The Taliban segregation codes meant that women were invaluable for gaining access to vulnerable women or conducting outreach research. This exception was not sanctioned by the entire Taliban movement, so instances of female participation, or lack thereof, varied with each circumstance. The city of Herat was particularly affected by Taliban adjustments to the treatment of women, as it had been one of the more cosmopolitan and outward-looking areas of Afghanistan prior to 1995. Women had previously been allowed to work in a limited range of jobs, but this was stopped by Taliban authorities. The new governor of Herat, Mullah Razzaq, issued orders for women to be forbidden to pass his office for fear of their distracting nature.\nOn 19 May 2022, the Taliban rulers ordered all female TV presenters to cover their faces on air. The directive came from the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, which replaced the country's Ministry of Women's Affairs after the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan.\nIn December 2022, the Taliban banned women from working in non-government organisations (NGOs), and ordered all such organisations to cease employment of female employees. This resulted in some NGOs being unable to continue their work in Afghanistan.\nEducation.\nFirst rule.\nThe Taliban claimed to recognise their Islamic duty to offer education to both boys and girls, yet a decree was passed that banned girls above the age of 8 from receiving education. Maulvi Kalamadin insisted it was only a temporary suspension and that women would return to school and work once facilities and street security were adapted to prevent cross-gender contact. The Taliban wished to have total control of Afghanistan before calling upon an Ulema body to determine the content of a new curriculum to replace the Islamic yet unacceptable Mujahadin version.\nThe female employment ban was felt greatly in the education system. Within Kabul alone, the ruling affected 106,256 girls, 148,223 male students, and 8,000 female university undergraduates. 7,793 female teachers were dismissed, a move that crippled the provision of education and caused 63 schools to close due to a sudden lack of educators. Some women ran clandestine schools within their homes for local children, or for other women under the guise of sewing classes, such as the Golden Needle Sewing School. The learners, parents, and educators were aware of the consequences should the Taliban discover their activities, but for those who felt trapped under the strict Taliban rule, such actions allowed them an opportunity and a sense of self-determination and hope. The Undersecretary of Education Mawlawi Sa'id Shahidkhayl explained in 1998, that education for women was in need of a fatwa regarding its limits.\nFrom 2021 to the present day.\nAfter their takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021, the Taliban initially gender segregated classrooms in universities as long as they \"followed Islamic standards\". However, in September 2021, they only allowed boys to return to school, preventing most teenage girls from returning to secondary education. The ban did not affect primary schools, but girls' attendance in those schools appeared to also have fallen significantly.\nIn March 2022, the Taliban abruptly reversed their plans to allow girls to resume their secondary school education (defined as grade seven and upwards in Afghanistan). With the exception of the current cohort of university students, this decision leaves graduating from sixth grade as the highest level of educational attainment possible for Afghan women. Secondary schools for boys reopened on schedule. Pakistani Islamic scholars, including Taqi Usmani, urged the Taliban to re-open secondary schools for women.\nOn 20 December 2022, the Ministry of Higher Education informed the country's public and private universities that women were suspended from university education. The ministry stated that female attendance would remain suspended \"until a suitable environment\" had been established at universities and promised that it would provide such a setting soon. However, BBC News pointed out that they had previously reneged on similar promises to reopen secondary education. Some Taliban leaders told \"BBC News\" that they disagreed with restrictions on female education. The Taliban decision was also widely condemned internationally. Some provinces still allow secondary education for girls despite the ban.\nGovernment.\nOn 17 August 2021, shortly after the Fall of Kabul, a senior member of the Taliban cultural commission, Enamullah Samangani, called on women to join the government. In contrast, in early September, the Taliban said that women would not be allowed to \"work in high-ranking posts\" in the government and \"ruled out\" women in the Cabinet. The acting Cabinet announced by the Taliban on 7 September consisted only of men.\nHealth care.\nPrior to the Taliban taking power in Afghanistan, male doctors had been allowed to treat women in hospitals, but the decree that no male doctor should be allowed to touch the body of a woman under the pretext of consultation was soon introduced. With fewer female health professionals in employment, the distances many women had to travel for attention increased while the provision of ante-natal clinics declined.\nIn Kabul, some women established informal clinics in their homes to service family and neighbours, yet as medical supplies were hard to obtain, their effectiveness was limited. Many women endured prolonged suffering or a premature death due to the lack of treatment. For those families that had the means, inclination, and mahram support, medical attention could be sought in Pakistan.\nIn October 1996, women were barred from accessing the traditional hammam, public baths, as the opportunities for socialising were ruled un-Islamic. These baths were an important facility in a nation where few possessed running water and the ban gave cause for the UN to predict a rise in scabies and vaginal infections among women denied methods of hygiene as well as access to health care. Nasrine Gross, an Afghan-American author, stated in 2001 that it has been four years since many Afghan women had been able to pray to their God as \"Islam prohibits women from praying without a bath after their periods\". \nIn June 1998, the Taliban banned women from attending general hospitals in the capital, whereas before they had been able to attend a women-only ward of general hospitals. This left only one hospital in Kabul at which they could seek treatment.\nAfter the Taliban takeover, female healthcare workers reported safety issues and being harassed by the Taliban. Maternal health care conditions declined and many doctors reported that infant and child mortality had increased. \nIn February 2023, the Taliban ordered pharmacies in Kabul and Mazar-i-Sharif to stop selling contraceptive medicines and devices.\nBan on women's participation in healthcare sector.\nIn December 2024, the Taliban's health ministry banned women from being trained in nursing and midwifery, according to media reports confirmed by \"The Guardian\". This was a reversal of an earlier February 2024 decision to permit basic medical training for women. According to \"NPR\", the health ministry had lobbied for an exemption from the general ban on women's education in the healthcare sector because \"in some provinces, the Taliban does not allow women to seek treatment from male medical professionals.\" The Taliban's ban on basic medical training for women was widely condemned by human rights organizations as a danger to the health and well-being of Afghan women and children, with Afghanistan already having among the highest maternal mortality ratios in the world according to 2020 data, before the Taliban's 2021 seizure of power. For example, Heather Barr of Human Right Watch stated: \"If you ban women from being treated by male healthcare professionals, and then you ban women from training to become healthcare professionals, the consequences are clear: women will not have access to healthcare and will die as a result.\" The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) stated that the ban \"is profoundly discriminatory, short-sighted and puts the lives of women and girls at risk in multiple ways.\"\nForced confinement.\nFamily harmony was badly affected by mental stress, isolation and depression that often accompanied the forced confinement of women. A 1998 survey of 160 women residents or former residents of Kabul found that 97 per cent showed signs of serious depression and 71 per cent reported a decline in their physical well-being. Latifa, a Kabul resident and author, wrote:\nThe apartment resembles a prison or a hospital. Silence weighs heavily on all of us. As none of us do much, we haven't got much to tell each other. Incapable of sharing our emotions, we each enclose ourselves in our own fear and distress. Since everyone is in the same black pit, there isn't much point in repeating time and again that we can't see clearly.\nThe Taliban closed the country's beauty salons. Nail varnish and cosmetics were prohibited.\nTaliban restrictions on the cultural presence of women covered several areas. Place names including the word \"women\" were modified so that the word was not used. Women were forbidden to laugh loudly as it was considered improper for a stranger to hear a woman's voice. Women were prohibited from participating in sports or entering a sports club.\nSlavery of women.\nIn 2017, Taliban members were accused of sanctioning forced marriages, marital rape, and slavery of women.\nPunishments.\nPunishments were often carried out publicly, either as formal spectacles held in sports stadiums or town squares or spontaneous street beatings. Civilians lived in fear of harsh penalties as there was little mercy; anyone caught breaking decrees were often treated with extreme violence. Examples include:\nMany punishments were carried out by individual militias without the sanction of Taliban authorities, as it was against official Taliban policy to punish women in the street. A more official line was the punishment of men for instances of female misconduct: a reflection of a patriarchal society and the belief that men are duty bound to control women. Maulvi Kalamadin stated in 1997, \"Since we cannot directly punish women, we try to use taxi drivers and shopkeepers as a means to pressure them\" to conform. Examples of punishment of men include:\nSince the Taliban's seizure of power in 2021, there have been many reports of sexual violence, rape, and torture of Afghan women in Taliban-run prisons, especially after the passage of \"anti-begging\" laws in 2024 resulted in larger numbers of women being detained. In one incident, \"\"The Guardian\" has seen video evidence of a female Afghan human rights activist being gang-raped and tortured in a Taliban jail by armed men.\"\nInternational response (pre-2021).\nThe protests of international agencies carried little weight with Taliban authorities, who gave precedence to their interpretation of Islamic law and did not feel bound by UN codes or human rights laws. After the Taliban takeover of Herat in 1995, the UN had hoped the gender policies would become more 'moderate' \"as it matured from a popular uprising into a responsible government with linkages to the donor community\". The Taliban refused to bow to international pressure and reacted calmly to aid suspensions.\nIn January 2006, a London conference on Afghanistan led to the creation of an International Compact, which included benchmarks for the treatment of women. The Compact includes the following point: \"Gender:By end-1389 (20 March 2011): the National Action Plan for Women in Afghanistan will be fully implemented; and, in line with Afghanistan's MDGs, female participation in all Afghan governance institutions, including elected and appointed bodies and the civil service, will be strengthened.\" However, an Amnesty International report on 11 June 2008, declared that there needed to be \"no more empty promises\" with regard to Afghanistan, citing the treatment of women as one such unfulfilled goal.\nIn September 2021, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan said that a ban on women's education in Afghanistan would be un-Islamic, and he called for the leadership to be inclusive and respect human rights.\nOn 29 December 2021, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the appointment of Rina Amiri as special envoy for Afghan women, girls, and human rights. The appointment came as women in the country were facing increased oppression by the ruling Taliban.\nPost-2021.\nWomen's dress.\nIn May 2022, the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice published a decree requiring all women in Afghanistan to wear full-body coverings when in public (either a burqa or an abaya paired with a niq\u0101b, which leaves only the eyes uncovered). The decree said enforcement action including fines, prison time, or termination from government employment would be taken against male \"guardians\" who fail to ensure their female relatives abide by the law. Rights groups, including the United Nations Mission in Afghanistan, sharply criticised the decision. The decision is expected to adversely affect the Islamic Emirate's chances of international recognition. In an interview with Christiane Amanpour, First Deputy Leader Sirajuddin Haqqani claimed the decree is only advisory and no form of hijab is compulsory in Afghanistan, though this contradicts the reality. It has been speculated that there is a genuine internal policy division over women's rights between hardliners, including Leader Hibatullah Akhundzada, and pragmatists, though they publicly present a united front.\nEducation and employment.\nIn July 2022, the Taliban advised female employees in the country's finance ministry to suggest a male relative to replace them so that the women could be dismissed from their positions. Up to 60 female employees reported receiving calls from the HR department requesting them to introduce a male family member to replace them.\nWhile Abdul Baqi Haqqani, the Minister for Higher Education until October 2022, was in favor of women being able to attend universities, his successor Neda Mohammad Nadeem opposes university education for women.\nAccording to BBC report, by 2025 Taliban government cancelled 18 education courses from Universities out of which six were women studies related, that included 'sexual harassment and human rights', midwifery courses, Gender and Development, The Role of Women in Communication, and Women's Sociology. \nTaliban also banned around 140 books authored by women out of total 680 books of \"concern\" being not in line with \"Sharia and Taliban policies\", that included even a title \"Safety in the Chemical Laboratory\".\nRecreation and sports.\nIn November 2022, women were banned from gyms, public baths, public parks, and amusement parks.\nRelationships and reproductive rights.\nIn February 2023, \"The Guardian\" reported that the Taliban began to restrict access to contraceptives. They ordered pharmacies to clear their stocks of birth control medicine and threatened midwives. In Kabul, Taliban fighters stated that \"contraceptive use and family planning is a western agenda\".\nIn March 2024, the Taliban's supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, announced that the group was reinstating flogging and death by stoning for women as punishment for adultery, saying, \"the Taliban's work did not end with the takeover of Kabul, it has only just begun.\"\nIn August 2024, the Taliban issued laws banning the transportation of women traveling alone, and women and men who are not related to each other mixing. Also at the same time they issued laws stating women must always veil their bodies in public and that a face covering is necessary and clothing should never be short, thin, or tight. The laws issued then also stated women should veil themselves in front of all male strangers and all non-Muslims, and that women should not be heard reciting, singing, or reading out loud in public, as well as that women are forbidden to look at men they are not related to by blood or marriage and vice versa.\nInternational response.\nIn January 2025, The International Criminal Court (ICC) issued two warrants against the Taliban supreme leader Haibatullah Akhundzada and the Chief judge, Abdul Hakim Haqqani, for committing crimes against humanity with their campaign of oppression and persecution of Afghan women and girls by depriving their freedom of movement, the rights to control their bodies, to education, and to a private and family life, whereas the alleged resistance and opposition are brutally suppressed with murder, imprisonment, torture, rape, and other forms of sexual violence, since 2021. ICC member states are obliged to arrest the wanted if they are on their territory. On 8 July 2025, the ICC upheld the arrest warrants against Akhundzada and Haqqani, with Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid rejecting them, saying that the Taliban does not recognize the ICC as an entity.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
