Like other counties in the Washington metropolitan area, the county has several U.S. government offices, scientific research and learning centers, and business campuses.\nEtymology.\nThe Maryland state legislature named Montgomery County after Richard Montgomery; the county was created from lands that had at one point or another been part of Frederick County. On September 6, 1776, Thomas Sprigg Wootton from Rockville, Maryland, introduced legislation, while serving at the Maryland Constitutional Convention, to create lower Frederick County as Montgomery County. The name, Montgomery County, along with the founding of Washington County, Maryland, after George Washington, was the first time in American history that counties and provinces in the Thirteen Colonies were not named after British referents. \nThe name use of Montgomery and Washington County were seen as further defiance to Great Britain during the American Revolutionary War. The county's nickname of \"MoCo\" is derived from \"Montgomery County\", in use as early as 2001.\nThe county's motto, adopted in 1976, is \"Gardez Bien\", a French phrase meaning \"Watch Well\". The county's motto is also the motto of its namesake's family.\nHistory.\nPrior to 1688, the first tract of land in what is now Montgomery County was granted by Charles I in a charter to the first Lord Baltimore, the head of the Calvert family. The county's creation was a focus of Thomas S. Wootton who, on August 31, 1776, introduced a measure to form a new county from Frederick County, Maryland to aid area residents in simplifying their business affairs. The measure passed, creating the new political entity of Montgomery County in what was then the colonial-era Province of Maryland.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (3.1%) is water. Montgomery County lies entirely inside the Piedmont plateau. The topography is generally rolling. Elevations range from a low of near sea level along the Potomac River to about 875 feet in the northernmost portion of the county north of Damascus. Relief between valley bottoms and hilltops is several hundred feet. Earthquakes are rare; the most recent one, on June 24, 2024, had a 1.8 magnitude and was centered near Spencerville, Maryland.\nWhen Montgomery County was created in 1776, its boundaries were defined as \"beginning at the east side of the mouth of Rock Creek on Potomac river [sic], and running with the said river to the mouth of Monocacy, then with a straight line to Par's spring, from thence with the lines of the county to the beginning\".\nThe county's boundary forms a sliver of land at the far northern tip of the county that is several miles long and averages less than 200 yards wide. In fact, a single house on Lakeview Drive and its yard is sectioned by this sliver into three portions, each separately contained within Montgomery, Frederick and Howard counties. These jurisdictions and Carroll County meet at a single point at Parr's Spring on Parr's Ridge.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNational protected areas.\n\u00a0 \nClimate.\nMontgomery County lies within the northern portions of the humid subtropical climate. It has four distinct seasons, including hot, humid summers and cool winters.\nPrecipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, with an average of of rainfall. Thunderstorms are common during the summer months, and account for the majority of the average 35 days with thunder per year.

Higher elevations in the north, such as Damascus, receive an average of of snowfall per year. During a particularly snowy winter, Damascus received during the 2009\u20132010 season.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSince the 1970s, the county has had in place a Moderately Priced Dwelling Unit (MPDU) zoning plan that requires developers to include affordable housing in any new residential developments that they construct in the county. The goal is to create socioeconomically mixed neighborhoods and schools so the rich and poor are not isolated in separate parts of the county. Developers who provide for more than the minimum amount of MPDUs are rewarded with permission to increase the density of their developments, which allows them to build more housing and generate more revenue. Montgomery County was one of the first counties in the U.S. to adopt such a plan, and many other areas have since followed suit.\nMontgomery County is by far one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse counties in the United States; four of the ten most culturally diverse cities and towns in the U.S. are in Montgomery County: Gaithersburg, ranking second; Germantown, ranking third; Silver Spring, ranking fourth; and Rockville, ranking ninth. Gaithersburg, Germantown, and Silver Spring all rank as more culturally diverse than New York City, San Jose, and Oakland.

The 2020 census tabulated Rockville's population at 67,117, making it the fourth-largest incorporated city in Maryland.\nRockville, along with neighboring Gaithersburg and Bethesda, is at the core of the Interstate 270 Technology Corridor which is home to numerous software and biotechnology companies as well as several federal government institutions. The city, one of the major retail hubs in Montgomery County, has several upscale regional shopping centers.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nSituated in the Piedmont region and crossed by three creeks (Rock Creek, Cabin John Creek, and Watts Branch), Rockville provided an excellent refuge for semi-nomadic Native Americans as early as 8000 BC. By the first millennium BC, a few of these groups had settled down into year-round agricultural communities that exploited the native flora, including sunflowers and marsh elder. By AD 1200, these early groups (dubbed \"Montgomery Indians\" by later archaeologists) were increasingly drawn into conflict with the Senecas and Susquehannocks who had migrated south from Pennsylvania and New York. Within the present-day boundaries of the city, six prehistoric sites have been uncovered and documented, along with numerous artifacts several thousand years old. By 1700, under pressure from European colonists, the majority of these original inhabitants had been driven away.\nThe indigenous population carved a path on the high ground, known as Sinequa Trail, which is now downtown Rockville. Later, the Maryland Assembly set the standard of 20 feet for main thoroughfares and designated the Rock Creek Main Road or Great Road to be built to this standard. In the mid-18th century, Lawrence Owen opened a small inn on the road. The place, known as Owen's Ordinary, took on greater prominence when, on April 14, 1755, Major General Edward Braddock stopped at Owen's Ordinary on a start of a mission from George Town (now Washington, D.C.) to press British claims of the western frontier. The location of the road, near the present Rockville Pike, was strategically located on higher ground, making it dry year-round.\n18th century.\nThe first land patents in the Rockville area were obtained by Arthur Nelson between 1717 and 1735. Within three decades, the first permanent buildings in what would become the center of Rockville were established on this land. Still a part of Prince George's County at this time, the growth of Daniel Dulaney's Frederick Town prompted the separation of the western portion of the county, including Rockville, into Frederick County in 1748.\nBeing a small, unincorporated town, early Rockville was known by a variety of names, including Owen's Ordinary, Hungerford's Tavern, and Daley's Tavern. The first recorded mention of the settlement later known as Rockville dates to the Braddock Expedition in 1755. On April 14, one of the approximately 2,000 men who were accompanying General Braddock through wrote the following: \"we marched to larance Owings or Owings Oardianary, a Single House, it being 18 miles and very dirty.\" Owen's Ordinary was a small rest stop on Rock Creek Main Road (later the Rockville Pike), which stretched from George Town to Frederick Town, and was then one of the largest thoroughfares in the colony of Maryland.\nOn September 6, 1776, the Maryland Constitutional Convention agreed to a proposal introduced by Thomas Sprigg Wootton wherein Frederick County, the largest and most populous county in Maryland, would be divided into three smaller subdivisions. The southern portion of the county, of which Rockville was a part, was named Montgomery County. The most populous and prosperous urban center in this new county was George Town, but its location at the far southern edge rendered it worthless as a seat of local government. Rockville, a small but centrally located and well-traveled town, was chosen as the seat. At the time, Rockville did not have a name; it was generally called Hungerford's Tavern, after the well-known tavern in it. After being named the county seat, the village was referred to by all as Montgomery Court House. The tavern served as the county courthouse, and it held its first such proceedings on May 20, 1777.\nIn 1784, William Prather Williams, a local landowner, hired a surveyor to lay out much of the town. In his honor, many took to calling the town Williamsburg. In practice, however, Williamsburg and Montgomery Court House were used interchangeably. Rockville came to greater prominence when Montgomery County was created and later when George Town was ceded to the federal government to create the District of Columbia.\n19th century.\nA proposal to name the town Wattsville, after the nearby Watts Branch, failed because the stream was later considered too small to give its name to the town. On July 16, 1803, when the area was officially entered into the county land records with the name \"Rockville\", derived from Rock Creek. Nevertheless, the name Montgomery Court House continued to appear on maps and other documents through the 1820s.\nBy petition of Rockville's citizens, the Maryland General Assembly incorporated the village on March 10, 1860. During the American Civil War, General George B. McClellan stayed at the Beall Dawson house in 1862. In addition, General J.E.B. Stuart and an army of 8,000 Confederate cavalrymen marched through and occupied Rockville on June 28, 1863, while on their way to Gettysburg and stayed at the Prettyman house. Jubal Anderson Early also crossed through Rockville on his way to and from his 1864 attack on Washington.\nIn 1913, on the birthday of Jefferson Davis, the United Daughters of the Confederacy erected a statue near the Rockville courthouse dedicated to Confederate soldiers from Montgomery County. The monument was removed in 2017 as part of a wave of removals of Confederate monuments and memorials in response to the 2015 Charleston church shooting; its base now stands by White's Ferry.\nIn 1873, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad extended its Metropolitan Branch to Rockville, connecting the city by rail to Washington, D.C.\nIn July 1891, the Tennallytown and Rockville Railway brought trolley service to the city. The line connected to the Georgetown and Tennallytown Railway terminus at Western Avenue and Wisconsin Avenue, and thence to downtown Washington, D.C.\n20th century.\nTrolley service operated for four decades, until, eclipsed by the growing usage of the automobile, service was halted in August 1935. The Blue Ridge Transportation Company provided bus service for Rockville and Montgomery County from 1924 through 1955. After 1955, Rockville would not see a concerted effort to develop a public transportation infrastructure until the 1970s, when the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) began work to extend the Washington Metro into Rockville and extended Metrobus service into Montgomery County. The Rockville station of Washington Metro began service on July 25, 1984, and the Twinbrook station began service on December 15, 1984. Metrobus service was supplemented by Montgomery County's own Ride On bus service starting in 1979. MARC, Maryland's Rail Commuter service, serves Rockville with its Brunswick line. From Rockville MARC provides service to Washington Union Station (southbound), and Frederick and Martinsburg, West Virginia (northbound), as well as intermediate points. Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service from Rockville to Chicago and Washington D.C.\nIn the mid-20th century, Rockville grew substantially, especially following the annexation of the Twinbrook subdivision in 1949, which added hundreds of new homes and thousands of new residents to the city. In 1954, Congressional Airport closed, and its land was sold to developers to build residences and a commercial shopping center. The shopping center, named Congressional Plaza, opened in 1958. These new areas provided affordable housing and grew quickly with young families eager to start their lives following World War II.\nDuring the Cold War, it was considered safer to remain in Rockville than to evacuate during a hypothetical nuclear attack on Washington, D.C. Bomb shelters were built, including the largest one at Glenview Mansion and 15 other locations. The I-270 highway was designated as an emergency aircraft landing strip. Two Nike missile launcher sites were located on Muddy Branch and Snouffer School Roads until the mid-1970s.\nIn 1975, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda Fitzgerald's caskets were reinterred at St. Mary's Catholic Church in Rockville, where his father, Edward, and a number of Key family members had been buried.\nFrom the 1960s, Rockville's town center, formerly one of the area's commercial centers, suffered from a period of decline. Rockville soon became the first city in Maryland to enter into a government funded urban renewal program. This resulted in the demolition of most of the original business district. Included in the plan was the unsuccessful Rockville Mall, which failed to attract either major retailers or customers and was demolished in 1994, various government buildings such as the new Montgomery County Judicial Center (opened 1982), and a reorganization of the road plan near the courthouse. The once-promising plan was for the most part a disappointment. Although efforts to restore the town center continue, the majority of the city's economic activity moved to Rockville Pike (MD Route 355/Wisconsin Avenue). The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's headquarters is on the Pike, just south of the city's corporate limits.\nThe R.E.M. song \"(Don't Go Back To) Rockville\", released in 1984, was written by Mike Mills about not wanting his girlfriend Ingrid Schorr to return to Rockville, Maryland.\n21st century.\nIn 2004, Rockville Mayor Larry Giammo announced plans to renovate Rockville Town Square, including building new stores and housing and moving the city's library. As of 2007, the new Rockville Town Center includes shops, restaurants, condominiums and apartments, as well as stages, fountains and the new Rockville Memorial Library.\nThe city is closely associated with the neighboring towns of Kensington and North Bethesda, an unincorporated census-designated place. The Music Center at Strathmore, an arts and theater center, opened in February 2005 in the latter of these two areas and is the second home of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. The Fitzgerald Theatre in Rockville Civic Center Park has provided diverse entertainment since 1960. In 1998, Regal Cinemas opened in Town Center and the city annexed 900 acres of land.\nThe city has a brass band in the British style.\nHistoric places.\nHistoric structures on the Register in and around downtown Rockville are:\nGeography.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.\nClimate.\nThe climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters.

{"id": "43484", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43484", "title": "Bethesda, Maryland", "text": "Bethesda () is an unincorporated, census-designated place in southern Montgomery County, Maryland, United States. Located just northwest of Washington, D.C., it is a major business and government center of the Washington metropolitan region and a national center for medical research. According to the 2020 census, the community had a population of 68,056.\nEtymology.\nIt takes its name from a local church, the Bethesda Meeting House (1820, rebuilt 1849), which in turn took its name from Jerusalem's Pool of Bethesda.\nHistory.\nBethesda is located in the traditional territory of the indigenous Native Piscataway and Nacotchtank at the time of European colonization. Fur trader Henry Fleet became the first European to visit the area, reaching it by sailing up the Potomac River. He stayed with the Piscataway tribe from 1623 to 1627, either as a guest or prisoner (historical accounts differ). Fleet eventually secured funding for another expedition to the region and was later granted proprietary rights to 2,000 acres of land in the nascent colony and became a member of Maryland's colonial legislature. Raids from the Senecas and Susquehannock resulted in the creation of the Maryland division of Rangers in 1694 to patrol the frontier.\nMost settlers in colonial Maryland were tenant farmers who paid their rent in tobacco, and colonists continued to expand farther north in search of fertile land. Henry Darnall (1645\u20131711) surveyed a area in 1694 which became the first land grant in Bethesda. Tobacco farming was the primary way of life in Bethesda throughout the 1700s. The city avoided seeing action during the Revolutionary War, although it became a supply region for the fledgling Continental Navy. The establishment of Washington, D.C., in 1790 deprived Montgomery County of its economic center at Georgetown, although the event had little effect on the small farmers throughout Bethesda.\nBetween 1805 and 1821, Bethesda became a rural way station after the development of the Washington and Rockville Turnpike, which carried tobacco and other products between Georgetown and Rockville, and north to Frederick. The Bethesda Meeting House, a Presbyterian church, was built in 1820. The church burned in 1849 and was rebuilt the same year about south, and its former location became the Cemetery of the Bethesda Meeting House.\nIn 1852, the postmaster general established a post office in the area and appointed Rev. A. R. Smith its first postmaster. By 1862, a small settlement had grown around a store and tollhouse along the turnpike known as \"Darcy's Store\" for the store's owner, William E. Darcy. It consisted of a blacksmith shop, a church and school, and a few houses and stores. In 1871, postmaster Robert Franck renamed the settlement for the church.\nA streetcar line was established in 1890 and suburbanization increased in the early 1900s, and Bethesda grew in population. Communities near railroad lines had grown the fastest during the 19th century. In 1910, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad completed its Georgetown Branch line from Silver Spring to Georgetown, including a storage yard there and multiple sidings serving industries in Bethesda. B&amp;O successor CSX ceased train service on the line in 1985, so the county transformed it into a trail in the rails-to-trails movement. The tracks were removed in 1994, and the first part of the trail was opened in 1998; it has become the most used rail-trail in the United States, averaging over one million users per year.\nSubdivisions began to appear on old farmland in the late 19th century, becoming the neighborhoods of Drummond, Woodmont, Edgemoor, and Battery Park. Farther north, several wealthy men made Rockville Pike famous for its mansions. These included Brainard W. Parker (\"Cedarcroft\", 1892), James Oyster (\"Strathmore\", 1899), George E. Hamilton (\"Hamilton House\", 1904; now the Stone Ridge School), Luke I. Wilson (\"Tree Tops\", 1926), Gilbert Hovey Grosvenor (\"Wild Acres\", 1928\u201329), and George Freeland Peter (\"Stone House\", 1930). In 1930, Armistead Peter's pioneering manor house \"Winona\" (1873) became the clubhouse of the Woodmont Country Club on land that is now part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) campus. Merle Thorpe's mansion \"Pook's Hill\" (1927, razed 1948) became the home-in-exile of the Norwegian royal family during World War II.\nBefore the passage of the Fair Housing Act of 1968, restrictive covenants were used in Bethesda to exclude racial and ethnic minorities\u2014primarily African-Americans, but also Asian-Americans and ethnic groups regarded as \"Semitic\", including Armenians, Jews, Iranians, Greeks, Turks, and Syrians. One 1938 restrictive covenant in the Bradley Woods subdivision of Bethesda said, \"No part of the land hereby conveyed, shall ever be used, or occupied by or sold, demised, transferred, conveyed, unto, or in trust for, leased, or rented, or given to negroes, or any person or persons of negro blood or extraction or to any person of the Semitic Race, blood, or origin, which racial description shall be deemed to include Armenians, Jews, Hebrews, Persians, Syrians, Greeks and Turks, or to any person of the Mongolian Race, blood, or origin, which racial description shall be deemed to include Chinese, Japanese, and Mongolians, except that this paragraph shall not be held to exclude partial occupancy of the premises by domestic servants of the purchaser or purchasers.\" In practice, covenants excluding \"Semitic races\" were generally used to exclude Jews as Montgomery County did not have notable Armenian, Greek, Syrian, or Turkish populations at the time.\nWorld War II and the subsequent expansion of government fed the rapid growth of Bethesda. Both the National Naval Medical Center (1940\u201342) and the NIH complex (1948) were built just to the north of the developing downtown, and this drew government contractors, medical professionals, and other businesses to the area. \nBethesda became the major urban core and employment center of southwestern Montgomery County. This recent vigorous growth followed the 1984 expansion of Metrorail with a station in Bethesda. The Bethesda Metro Center was built over the Red Line metro rail, which opened up further commercial and residential development in the immediate vicinity. In the 2000s, the strict height limits on construction in the District of Columbia led to the development of mid-and high-rise office and residential towers around the Bethesda Metro station.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and (0.38%) is water. The main commercial corridor that passes through Bethesda is Maryland Route 355 (known as Wisconsin Avenue in Bethesda and as Rockville Pike and Hungerford Drive in more northern communities), which, to the north, connects Bethesda with the communities of North Bethesda and Rockville, ending, after several name changes, in Frederick. Toward the South, Rockville Pike becomes Wisconsin Avenue near the NIH Campus and continues beyond Bethesda through Chevy Chase, Friendship Heights and into Washington, D.C., ending in Georgetown.\nThe area commonly known as Downtown Bethesda is centered at the intersection of Wisconsin Avenue, Old Georgetown Road and East-West Highway. This intersection is about two and one-half miles from Washington, D.C.'s western boundary, making Bethesda a close-in suburb of the nation's capital. Other focal points of downtown Bethesda include the Woodmont Triangle, bordered by Old Georgetown Road (Maryland Route 187), Woodmont and Rugby Avenues, and the Bethesda Row, centered at the intersection of Woodmont Avenue and Bethesda Avenue. Much of the dense construction in that area followed the opening of the Bethesda station on the Red Line of the Washington Metro rapid transit system, also located at this intersection and the centerpiece of the Bethesda Metro Center development. The Medical Center Metro stop lies about 0.7 miles north of the Bethesda stop, Medical Center, which serves the NIH Campus, the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, and the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2000.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 55,277 people, 23,659 households, and 14,455 families residing in the CDP.

Males had a median income of $84,797 versus $57,569 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $58,479. About 1.7% of families and 3.3% of the population were below the poverty line, including 1.8% of those under age 18 and 4.1% of those age 65 or over. Many commute to Washington, D.C., for work. The average price of a four-bedroom, two-bath home in Bethesda in 2010 was $806,817 (which ranks it as the twentieth most expensive community in America).\nBethesda is often associated with its neighboring communities, Potomac, Chevy Chase, Great Falls, Virginia, and McLean, Virginia, for their similar demographics.\n2020.\nThe ethnic makeup in 2020 was 69.5% non-Hispanic white, 8.9% Hispanic or Latino, 4.9% Black, 11.7% Asian, 0.3% American Indian, and 8.2% of two or more races. 24.4% of the population was foreign-born.\nLandmarks.\nImportant medical institutions located in Bethesda include the National Institutes of Health campus, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, and the adjoining Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, as well as a number of other military medical and research institutions. Other federal institutions include the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division.\nThe headquarters of defense conglomerate Lockheed Martin, managed health care company Coventry Health Care and hotel and resort chains Marriott International and Host Hotels &amp; Resorts, Inc. are located in Bethesda.

Although officially unincorporated, it is an edge city with a population of 81,015 at the 2020 census, making it the fifth-most-populous place in Maryland after Baltimore, Columbia, Germantown, and Waldorf.\nDowntown Silver Spring, located next to the northern tip of Washington, D.C., is the oldest and most urbanized area of Silver Spring, surrounded by several inner suburban residential neighborhoods inside the Capital Beltway. Many mixed-use developments combining retail, residential, and office space have been built since 2004.\nSilver Spring takes its name from a mica-flecked spring discovered there in 1840 by Francis Preston Blair, who subsequently bought much of the area's surrounding land. Acorn Park, south of downtown, is believed to be the site of the original spring.\nGeography.\nAs an unincorporated census-designated place, Silver Spring's boundaries are not consistently defined. As of the 2010 census, the U.S. Census Bureau gives Silver Spring a total area of , which is all land; however, the CDP contains some creeks and small ponds. This definition is a 15% reduction from the used in previous years.\nSilver Spring contains the following neighborhoods: Downtown Silver Spring, East Silver Spring, Woodside, Woodside Park, Lyttonsville, North Hills Sligo Park, Long Branch, Indian Spring, Goodacre Knolls, Franklin Knolls, Montgomery Knolls, Clifton Park Village, New Hampshire Estates, Oakview, and Woodmoor.\nThe U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Postal Service, Silver Spring Urban Planning District, and Greater Silver Spring Chamber of Commerce, each use their own slightly different definitions. The Postal Service in particular assigns Silver Spring mailing addresses to a large swath of eastern Montgomery County sometimes called \"Greater Silver Spring\", including Four Corners, Woodmoor, Wheaton, Glenmont, Forest Glen, Forest Glen Park, Aspen Hill, Hillandale, White Oak, Colesville, Colesville Park, Cloverly, Calverton, Briggs Chaney, Greencastle, Northwood Park, Ashton, Sandy Spring, Sunset Terrace, Fairland, Lyttonsville, Kemp Mill, a portion of Langley Park, and a portion of Adelphi. The area that has a Silver Spring mailing address is larger in area than any city in Maryland except Baltimore.\nLandmarks in the downtown area include the AFI Silver Theatre, the National Museum of Health and Medicine, a branch of The Fillmore, and the headquarters of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Greater Silver Spring includes the headquarters of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community in the U.S.\nParks and recreation.\nFour major creeks run through Silver Spring: from west to east, they are Rock Creek, Sligo Creek, Long Branch, and Northwest Branch. Each is surrounded by parks offering hiking trails, playgrounds, picnic areas, and tennis courts. On weekends, roads are closed in the parks for bicycling and walking.\nNorthwest Branch Park also includes the Rachel Carson Greenway Trail, named after Rachel Carson, the author of \"Silent Spring\" and a former resident of the area. It continues north to Wheaton Regional Park, in Wheaton, which is home to the Brookside Gardens.\nThe Jessup Blair Park, south of downtown, has a soccer field, tennis courts, basketball courts, and a picnic area. There are similar local parks throughout the residential parts of the community.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2023.\nIn 2023, the most populous races in Silver Spring are White / Caucasian (30,244 | 37.0%), Black / African American (24,320 | 29.7%), and Hispanic or Latino (19,307 | 23.6%.\nIn 2023, the most populous ancestries reported in Silver Spring are Central American (12,786 | 15.6%), Subsaharan African (10,750 | 13.1%), German (6,036 | 7.4%), Ethiopian (5,947 | 7.3%), and Irish (5,835 | 7.1%), together accounting for 50.5% of all Silver Spring residents.\n2020.\nAs of the 2020 census, 81,015 people lived in Silver Spring. There were 32,114 households; their average annual income was $83,782.\n50.9% of the population was female.\n33.3% of the population was White (Non-Latino), 28% was Black or African American alone (Non-Latino), 19.4% of the population was Other (Latino), 7.12% of the population was Asian (Non-Latino), 6.68% of the population was claimed White (Latino), 3.16% was Multiracial (Non-Latino), 1.08% was Multiracial (Latino), 0.47% was Black or African American (Latino), 0.29% was Asian (Latino), and 0.19% was American Indian &amp; Alaska Native (Latino).\n28% of the population identified as Latino.\nAs of 2019, 36.5% of Silver Spring residents (29,800 people) were born outside of the United States, which is higher than the national average of 13.9%. Of these, the most predominant foreign-born people are from El Salvador, Ethiopia, India, and China.\n2010.\n\"Note: For the 2010 census, the boundaries of the Silver Spring CDP were changed, reducing the land area by approx. 15%. As a result, the population count for 2010 shows a 6.6% decrease, while the population density increased 11%.\"\nAs of the 2010 census, there were 71,452 residents, 28,603 total households, and 15,684 families residing in the Silver Spring CDP. The population density was . There were 30,522 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the community, as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, for residents who self-identified as being members of \"one race\" was 45.7% White (7.8% German, 7.0% Irish, 5.7% English), 27.8% Black or African American (5.2% Ethiopian, 1.1% Haitian), 0.6% American Indian and Alaska Native, 7.9% Asian (2.35% Indian, 1.74% Vietnamese, 1.32% Chinese, 0.63% Korean), 0.1% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, and 13.2% \"Some Other Race\" (SOR). 4.8% of the CDP's residents self-identified as being members of two or more races. Hispanic or Latino residents \"of any race\" comprised 26.3% of the population (12.3% Salvadoran, 3.71% Guatemalan, 2.83% Mexican). Like much of the Washington metropolitan area, Silver Spring is home to many people of Ethiopian ancestry.\nThere were 28,603 households, out of which 27.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 37.6% were married couples living together, 11.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 45.2% were non-families. 33.6% of all households were made up of individuals living alone, and 16.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.49 and the average family size was 3.21.\nIn the census area, the population was spread out, with 21.4% under the age of 18, 9.4% from 18 to 24, 37.1% from 25 to 44, 23.8% from 45 to 64, and 8.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 33.8 years. For every 100 females, there were 94.9 males, and for every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 92.2 males.\nThe median income for a household in the census area was US$, and the median income for a family was US$.\nHistory.\nBefore European settlement, present-day Silver Spring had been inhabited by various indigenous peoples for about 10,000 years. Among them were the Piscataway, an Algonquian-speaking people who may have established a few villages along Sligo Creek and Rock Creek.\n19th century.\nIn 1840, Francis Preston Blair, who later helped organize the modern Republican Party, along with his daughter, Elizabeth, discovered a spring flowing with chips of mica believed to be the now-dry spring visible at Acorn Park. Blair was looking for a site for his summer home to escape the summer heat of Washington, D.C. Two years later, Blair completed a 20-room mansion he dubbed \"Silver Spring\" on a country homestead. In 1854, Blair moved to the mansion permanently. The house stood until 1954.\nBy 1854, Blair's son, Montgomery Blair, who became Postmaster General under Abraham Lincoln and represented Dred Scott before the U.S. Supreme Court, built the Falkland house in the area.\nBy the end of the decade, Elizabeth Blair married Samuel Phillips Lee, third cousin of future Confederate leader Robert E. Lee, and gave birth to a boy, Francis Preston Blair Lee, who went on to become the first popularly elected Senator in U.S. history.\nDuring the American Civil War, Abraham Lincoln visited the Silver Spring mansion several times, where he relaxed by playing town ball with Francis P. Blair's grandchildren.\nIn 1864, Confederate States Army General Jubal Early occupied Silver Spring before the Battle of Fort Stevens. After the engagement, fleeing Confederate soldiers razed Montgomery Blair's Falkland residence.\nAt the time, there was a community called Sligo located at the intersection of the Washington-Brookeville Turnpike and the Washington-Colesville-Ashton Turnpike, now named Georgia Avenue and Colesville Road. Sligo included a tollhouse, a store, a post office, and a few homes. The communities of Woodside, Forest Glen, and Linden were founded after the Civil War. These small towns largely lost their separate identities when a post office was established in Silver Spring in 1899.\nBy the end of the 19th century, the region began to develop into a town of size and importance. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's Metropolitan Branch opened on April 30, 1873, and ran through Silver Spring from Washington, D.C., to Point of Rocks, Maryland.\nThe first suburban development appeared in 1887 when Selina Wilson divided part of her farm on present-day Colesville Road (U.S. Route 29) and Brookeville Road into five- and ten-acre ( - and m2) plots. In 1892, Francis Preston Blair Lee and his wife, Anne Brooke Lee, gave birth to E. Brooke Lee, who is known as the father of modern Silver Spring for his visionary attitude toward developing the region.\n20th century.\nIn the early 20th century, E. Brooke Lee and his brother, Blair Lee I, founded the Lee Development Company, whose Colesville Road office building remains a downtown fixture. Dale Drive, a winding roadway, was built to provide vehicular access to much of the family's substantial real estate holdings. Suburban development continued in 1922 when Woodside Development Corporation created Woodside Park, a neighborhood of plot home sites built on the former Noyes estate in 1923. \nIn 1924, Washington trolley service on Georgia Avenue (present-day Maryland Route 97) across B&amp;O's Metropolitan Branch was suspended so that an underpass could be built. The underpass was completed two years later, but trolley service never resumed. It would be rebuilt again in 1948 with additional lanes for automobile traffic, opening the areas to the north for readily accessible suburban development.\nTakoma-Silver Spring High School, built in 1924, was the first high school for Silver Spring. The community's rapid growth led to the need for a larger school. In 1935, when a new high school building was erected at Wayne Avenue and Sligo Creek Parkway, the school was renamed Montgomery Blair High School. In 1998, the school was moved again, to a new, larger facility at the corner of Colesville Road (U.S. Route 29) and University Boulevard (Maryland Route 193). The former Blair building became a combined middle school and elementary school, housing Silver Spring International Middle School and Sligo Creek Elementary School.\nThe Silver Spring Shopping Center, built by developer Albert Small and Silver Theatre, designed by theater architect John Eberson, were completed in 1938 at the request of developer William Alexander Julian. The Silver Spring Shopping Center was one of the nation's first retail spaces with a street-front parking lot, defying conventional wisdom that merchandise should be in windows closest to the street so that people could see it. The shopping center was purchased in 1944 by real estate developer Sam Eig, who helped attract large retailers to the city.\nBefore the 1950s, Silver Spring was known as a sundown town, in part because of influential land owners. The North Washington Real Estate Company designed to be white-only, written in its deeds to prevent the sale of land to anyone else. The Fair Housing Act outlawed this practice in 1968, almost two decades after \"Shelley v. Kramer\" made racial covenants unenforceable. A 1939 deed for a property owned by Rozier J. Beech in the Sixteenth Street Village subdivision of Silver Spring said, \"No negro, or any person or persons of whose blood or extraction or to any person of the semitic race whose blood or origin of racial description will be deemed to include Armenians, Jews, Hebrews, Persians, Syrians, Greeks and Turks, shall use or occupy any building or any lot, except that this covenant shall not prevent occupancy by domestic servants of a different race domiciled with an owner or tenant.\" In practice, covenants excluding \"Semitic races\" were primarily used to discriminate against Jews, as Montgomery County did not have significant Armenian, Greek, Iranian, or Turkish populations at the time.\nIn all, housing in more than of greater Silver Spring was blocked off to Blacks, Jews, Armenians, Persians, Turks, and Greeks, who were considered non-white at the time.\nBy the 1950s, Silver Spring was the second-busiest retail market between Baltimore and Richmond; major retailers included the Hecht Company, J.C. Penney, and Sears, Roebuck and Company. In 1954, the 1842 Blair mansion \"Silver Spring\" was razed and replaced with the Blair Station post office. 1960 saw the opening of Wheaton Plaza, later called Westfield Wheaton, a shopping center several miles north of downtown Silver Spring. It captured much of the town's business, and the downtown area began a long period of decline.\nOn December 19, 1961, a segment of the Capital Beltway (I-495) was opened to traffic between Georgia Avenue (MD 97) and University Boulevard East (MD 193). \nOn August 17, 1964, the final segment of the Beltway was opened to traffic, and a ribbon-cutting ceremony was held near the New Hampshire Avenue interchange, with a speech by Gov. J. Millard Tawes, who called it a \"road of opportunity\" for Maryland and the nation.\nWashington Metro rail service into Washington, D.C., helped breathe new life into the region starting with the 1978 opening of Silver Spring station. The Metro Red Line followed the right-of-way of the B&amp;O Metropolitan Branch, with the Metro tracks centered between the B&amp;O's eastbound and westbound mains. The Red Line heads south to downtown DC from Silver Spring, running at grade before descending into Union Station. By the mid-1990s, the Red Line continued north from the downtown Silver Spring core, entering a tunnel just past the Silver Spring station and running underground to three more stations: Forest Glen, Wheaton, and Glenmont.\nSilver Spring's downtown continued to decline in the 1980s. The Hecht Company closed its downtown location in 1987 and moved to Wheaton Plaza while forbidding another department store to rent its old spot. City Place, a multi-level mall, was established in the old Hecht Company building in 1992, but it had difficulty attracting quality anchor stores and gained a reputation as a budget mall. In the mid-1990s, developers considered building a mega-mall and entertainment complex called the American Dream, similar to the Mall of America, in downtown Silver Spring, but were unable to secure funding. A bright spot for the city in the late 1980s and early 1990s was the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) consolidating its headquarters to four new high-rise office buildings near the Silver Spring Metro station.\nA February 16, 1996, train collision on the Silver Spring section of the Metropolitan line left 11 people dead. A MARC commuter train bound for Washington Union Station during the Friday evening rush hour collided with the Amtrak \"Capitol Limited\" train and erupted in flames on a snow-swept stretch of track.\nThe Maryland State Highway Administration started studies of improvements to the Capital Beltway in 1993, and have continued, off and on, examining a number of alternatives since then, including HOV lanes and high-occupancy toll lanes.\n21st century.\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, downtown Silver Spring began to see the results of redevelopment. Several city blocks near City Place Mall were rebuilt to accommodate a new outdoor shopping plaza called Downtown Silver Spring. As downtown Silver Spring revived, its 160-year history was celebrated in a 2002 PBS documentary entitled \"Silver Spring: Story of an American Suburb\".\nIn 2003, Discovery, Inc. moved its headquarters from nearby Bethesda to a new building in downtown Silver Spring. In 2017, Discovery, Inc. CEO David Zaslav announced that the company was relocating to New York City to operate close to their \"ad partners on Madison Avenue\", \"investors and analysts on Wall Street\", and their \"creative and production community\".) 2003 also brought the reopening of the Silver Theatre, as AFI Silver, under the auspices of the American Film Institute.\nBeginning in 2004, the downtown redevelopment was marketed locally with the \"silver sprung\" advertising campaign, which declared on buses and in print ads that Silver Spring had \"sprung\" and was ready for business. In June 2007, \"The New York Times\" noted that downtown was \"enjoying a renaissance, a result of public involvement and private investment that is turning it into an arts and entertainment center\".\nIn 2005, downtown Silver Spring was awarded the silver medal of the Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence\nIn 2007, the downtown Silver Spring area gained attention when an amateur photographer was prohibited from taking photographs in what appeared to be a public street. The land, leased to the Peterson Companies, a developer, for $1, was technically private property. The citizens argued that the Downtown Silver Spring development, partially built with public money, was still public property. After a protest on July 4, 2007, Peterson relented and allowed photography on their property under limited conditions. Peterson also claimed that it could revoke these rights at any time. The company further stated that other activities permitted in public spaces, such as organizing protests or distributing campaign literature, were still prohibited. In response, Montgomery County Attorney Leon Rodriguez said that the street in question, Ellsworth Drive, \"constitutes a public forum\" and that the First Amendment's protection of free speech applies there. In an eight-page letter, Rodriguez wrote, \"Although the courts have not definitively resolved the issue of whether the taking, as opposed to the display, of photographs is a protected expressive act, we think it is likely that a court would consider the taking of the photograph to be part of the continuum of action that leads to the display of the photograph and thus also protected by the First Amendment.\" The incident was part of a trend in the United States regarding the blurring of public and private spaces in developments built with both public and private funds.\nIn 2008, construction began on the long-planned Intercounty Connector (ICC), which crosses the upper reaches of Silver Spring. The highway's first section opened on February 21, 2011; the entire route was completed by 2012. In July 2010, the Silver Spring Civic Building and Veterans Plaza opened in downtown Silver Spring.\nBetween 2015 and 2016, the long-struggling City Place Mall was renovated and reopened as Ellsworth Place The old B&amp;O Passenger Station was restored between 2000 and 2002, as recorded in the documentary film \"Next Stop: Silver Spring\".\nIn May 2019, Peterson announced a $10 million renovation of the Downtown Silver Spring development that will include public art and a new outdoor plaza, featuring green space.\nCulture.\nDowntown Silver Spring hosts several entertainment, musical, and ethnic festivals, the most notable of which are the Silverdocs documentary film festival held each June and hosted by Discovery Communications and the American Film Institute, an annual Thanksgiving Day Parade (Saturday before Thanksgiving) for Montgomery County. The Silver Spring Jazz Festival is the largest annual event, drawing people to the free festival held on the second Saturday in September. Featuring local jazz artists and a battle of high school bands, the Silver Spring Jazz Festival has featured Wynton Marsalis, Arturo Sandoval, S\u00e9rgio Mendes, Aaron Neville, the Mingus Big Band, the Fred Wesley Group, and other jazz music artists.\nThe Fillmore is a live entertainment and music venue with a capacity of 2000 people. It opened in 2011 in the former JCPenney building on Colesville Road. The venue joins the American Film Institute and Discovery Communications as cornerstones of the downtown Silver Spring's arts and entertainment district, and has featured performances by artists Prince Royce, Minus the Bear, Tyga, Wale, Schoolboy Q, Migos, and others. In August 2012 R&amp;B singer Reesa Renee launched her album \"Reelease\" at the Fillmore.\nDowntown Silver Spring is home to the Cultural Arts Center at Montgomery College. The Cultural Arts Center offers a varied set of cultural performances, lectures, films, and conferences. It is a resource for improving cultural literacy, encouraging cross-cultural understanding, and to build bridges between the arts, cultural studies, and other disciplines concerned with the expression of culture.\nDining in Silver Spring is varied, including American, African, Burmese, Ethiopian, Guatemalan, Japanese, Moroccan, Italian, Mexican, Salvadoran, Jamaican, Vietnamese, Lebanese, Thai, Persian, Chinese, Indian, Greek, and fusion restaurants, and national and regional chains.\nSilver Spring has several churches, synagogues, temples, and other religious institutions, including the World Headquarters of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Silver Spring serves as the primary urban area in Montgomery County and its revitalization has ushered in an eclectic mix of people and ideas, evident in the fact that the flagship high school, Montgomery Blair High School, has no majority group with each major racial and ethnic group claiming a significant percentage.\nSilver Spring hosts the American Film Institute Silver Theatre and Culture Center, on Colesville Road. The theatre showcases American and foreign films. Gandhi Brigade, a youth development media project, began in Silver Spring out of the Long Branch neighborhood. Docs in Progress, a non-profit media arts center devoted to the promotion of documentary filmmaking is located at the \"Documentary House\" in downtown Silver Spring. Silver Spring Stage, an all-volunteer community theater, performs in Woodmoor, approximately north up Colesville Road from the downtown area. Downtown Silver Spring is also home to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), an agency of the United States Department of Commerce that includes the National Weather Service, the American Nurses Association, and several real estate development, biotechnology, and media and communications companies.\nStevie Nicks of the band Fleetwood Mac has credited Silver Spring as an inspiration for the title of the band's 1977 song \"Silver Springs\". In a 1998 interview, Nicks said, \"I wrote Silver Springs, about Lindsey [Buckingham]. And I\u2014we were in Maryland somewhere driving under a freeway sign that said Silver Spring, Maryland. And I loved the name...Silver Springs sounded like a pretty fabulous place to me. And uh, 'You could be my silver springs...' that's just a whole symbolic thing of what you could have been to me.\"\nTransportation.\nThe major roads in Silver Spring are mostly three- to five-lane highways. The Capital Beltway can be accessed from Georgia Avenue (MD 97), Colesville Road (US 29), and New Hampshire Avenue (MD 650).\nThe long-planned Intercounty Connector (ICC) (MD-200) toll road opened in three segments between February 2011 and November 2014. ICC interchanges in the Silver Spring area include Georgia Avenue, Layhill Road (MD-182), New Hampshire Avenue, Columbia Pike (US-29) and Briggs Chaney Road.\nThe multilevel Paul Sarbanes Transit Center in downtown Silver Spring, named in honor of former U.S. Senator Paul Sarbanes from Maryland, is served by the MARC Train on the Brunswick Line, Washington Metro on the Red Line at Silver Spring station, Metrobus, Ride On, the free VanGo, intercity Greyhound bus, and local taxi services. The bus terminal is the busiest in the Washington metropolitan area. This transit facility serves nearly passengers daily. The transit center is an expanded version of an older bus, train, and Metro terminal. Begun in October 2008, the expansion, planned to consume $91 million and four years, opened four years late and $50 million over budget on September 20, 2015.\nThe transit center will also be served by the Purple Line light rail. Under construction by the Maryland Transit Administration (MTA), the line is expected to open in late 2027, and will connect Silver Spring with Bethesda to the west, the University of Maryland, College Park to the east, and the Washington Metro's New Carrollton station to the southeast.\nThe Washington Metro's Forest Glen station is also located in Silver Spring. MARC Train stops at nearby Kensington station.\nEducation.\nMontgomery County Public Schools.\nSilver Spring is served by Montgomery County Public Schools, a county-wide public school district.\nMiddle schools.\nPrior to 2010, Montgomery Blair High School was the only high school in Silver Spring.

It was formerly St. Camillus School, which was operated by sisters of Notre Dame de Namur University and opened in 1954. In the mid-1960s, it had up to 1,200 students. Working-class people were the main clientele. The student population was in decline by the 1980s as working-class people moved from the area. By the same decade the teachers were mostly lay staff. In the decade of the 2000s the school's financial situation deteriorated. In 2010 the school had 260 students. It merged into Saint Francis International, which opened in 2010; at that time all teachers had to reapply for their jobs. In 2010 Saint Francis International had 435 students at all campuses. In 2014 it had 485 students at all campuses; over 70% the students were of parents born abroad.\nMontgomery College.\nA portion of the Montgomery College, the Takoma Park/Silver Spring campus, is located in the Silver Spring; the rest of the campus located in Takoma Park.

The original venue was destroyed by fire in 1915, reopening in 1925 after rebuilding. Moulin Rouge is southwest of Montmartre, in the Paris district of Pigalle on Boulevard de Clichy in the 18th \"arrondissement\", and has a landmark red windmill on its roof. The closest m\u00e9tro station is Blanche.\nMoulin Rouge is best known as the birthplace of the modern form of the can-can dance. Originally introduced as a seductive dance by the courtesans who operated from the site, the can-can dance revue evolved into a form of entertainment of its own and led to the introduction of cabarets across Europe. Today, the Moulin Rouge is a tourist attraction, offering predominantly musical dance entertainment for visitors from around the world. The club's decor retains much of the romance of \"Belle \u00c9poque\" France.\nHistory.\nCreation and early success.\nOn 6 October 1889, the Moulin Rouge opened as the Jardin de Paris, an outdoor garden caf\u00e9-concert, at the foot of the Montmartre hill. Its creator Joseph Oller and his Manager Charles Zidler were formidable businessmen who understood the public's tastes. The aim was to attract wealthy individuals to experience the ambiance of the fashionable district of Montmartre, which was perceived as a form of slumming. The elaborate setting, featuring a garden adorned with a large elephant, provided an environment where individuals from various social strata could interact. This included workers, local residents, artists, the middle class, businessmen, stylish women, and tourists passing through Paris. Nicknamed \"The First Palace of Women\" by Oller and Zidler, the cabaret swiftly garnered significant acclaim. Key factors contributing to its success included:\nGreatest moments.\nDuring its early years, the Moulin Rouge featured extravagant shows inspired by the circus, along with attractions that gained widespread fame, such as P\u00e9tomane. Concert-dances were organized daily at 10 pm. Between 1886 and 1910, the comic duo Footit and Chocolat, comprising a white authoritarian clown and a black long-suffering Auguste, gained popularity and were frequently featured on Moulin Rouge posters.\nOn 19 April 1890, the first revue, \"Circassiens et Circassiennes,\" debuted. On 26 October 1890, during a private visit to Paris, the Prince of Wales, later Edward VII, reserved a table to witness a quadrille at the Moulin Rouge, where La Goulue famously greeted him with the exclamation, \"Hey, Wales, the champagne's on you!\" In 1891, Toulouse-Lautrec created his first poster for the Moulin Rouge, featuring \"La Goulue\".\nIn 1893, the \"Bal des Quat'z'Arts\" sparked scandal with its procession featuring a nude Cleopatra surrounded by young naked women. On 12 November 1897, the Moulin Rouge closed for the first time to mourn the passing of its manager and co-founder, Charles Zidler. Yvette Guilbert paid homage to him, saying, \"You have the knack of creating popular pleasure, in the finest sense of the word, of entertaining crowds with subtlety, according to the status of those to be entertained.\"\nIn 1900, the Universal Exhibition attracted visitors from around the world to the Moulin Rouge, solidifying Paris's reputation as a city of decadent pleasure. This led to the establishment of imitation \"Moulin Rouges\" and \"Montmartres\" in many other countries.\nOperetta and grand shows.\nIn January 1903, the Moulin Rouge underwent renovation and improvement under the direction of \u00c9douard Niermans, a prominent architect of the Belle \u00c9poque era, amongst other works he designed the brasserie Mollard, the Casino de Paris, the Folies Berg\u00e8re in Paris, the Palace H\u00f4tel in Ostend in Belgium, the rebuilding of the H\u00f4tel du Palais in Biarritz, and the creation of the Hotel Negresco on the Promenade des Anglais in Nice. This included the addition of aperitif concerts, attracting the fashionable elite for dining and entertainment in a luxurious setting. Until the outbreak of the First World War, the Moulin Rouge became renowned for its operetta performances. Successful shows during this period included Voluptata, La Feuille de Vigne, Le R\u00eave d'Egypte, Tais-toi tu m'affoles, among others, each with evocative titles. On 3 January 1907, during the performance of Le R\u00eave d'Egypte, Colette exchanged scandalous kisses that revealed her connection to the Duchess of Morny, leading to the show being banned. Mistinguett made her debut at the Moulin Rouge on 29 July 1907 in the Revue de la Femme, showcasing her undeniable talent. She quickly rose to fame, achieving immense success the following year with Max Dearly in La Valse chaloup\u00e9e. Born into poverty, Mistinguett had a sharp wit and determination that propelled her to become a successful businesswoman, touring extensively across Europe and the United States. On 9 April 1910, a former lady-in-waiting to Empress Eug\u00e9nie attended a showing of the Revue Amoureuse at the Moulin Rouge and was so captivated by the faithful recreation of a ceremony for the return of troops from Italy that she exclaimed, \"Long Live the Empress!\"\nTragically, on 27 February 1915, the Moulin Rouge was destroyed by fire during building works, resulting in a nine-year closure. In 1925, the rebuilt Moulin Rouge reopened its doors to the public.\nMistinguett years.\nFollowing World War I, Francis Salabert assumed management of the Moulin Rouge. As a businessman rather than a showman, he entrusted Jacques-Charles, a prominent impresario, with revitalizing the cabaret. The Moulin Rouge experienced a resurgence with the performances of stars such as Mistinguett, Jeanne Aubert, and Maurice Chevalier, as well as the introduction of American revues featuring the Hoffmann Girls.\nIn 1923, composer and conductor Rapha\u00ebl Beretta proposed a reconstruction of the Moulin Rouge's music hall on a larger scale. The iconic mill structure, supported by a central facade adorned with oval dormers, was designed by Gesmar, a 20-year-old set designer whose work became synonymous with the venue.\nJacques-Charles and Mistinguett collaborated on several acclaimed revues, including:\n1925: \"Revue Mistinguett\"\n1926: \"\u00c7a c'est Paris\"\n1928: \"Paris qui tourne\"\nDuring a 1927 performance, an incident occurred when female dancers emerged from multi-tiered artificial cakes covered in real frosting. The slippery cake cream on their high heels caused them to repeatedly slip and fall on stage, resulting in disruptions to the show.\nMistinguett's tenure at the Moulin Rouge produced enduring songs such as \"Valencia,\" \"\u00c7a c'est Paris\" (both by Jose Padilla), \"Il m'a vue nue,\" \"On m' suit,\" and \"La Java de Doudoune,\" the latter performed with Jean Gabin.\nAfter Mistinguett.\nIn 1929, Mistinguett retired from the stage, leading to the transformation of the Moulin Rouge's ballroom into an ultra-modern Night Club.\nFrom June to August 1929, the revue \"Lew Leslie's Blackbirds\", featuring jazz singer and Broadway star Adelaide Hall, along with a troop of a hundred black artists accompanied by the Jazz Plantation Orchestra, became the hit of the season at the Moulin Rouge.\nIn 1937, the Cotton Club, renowned in New York, was showcased at the Moulin Rouge, alongside performances by Ray Ventura and his Collegians.\nDuring the Second World War (1939\u20131945), the Moulin Rouge was highlighted in the German Occupation Guide as a must-visit attraction in Paris. Its stage shows continued for the occupation troops and were mentioned in autobiographies of German officers such as Ernst J\u00fcnger and Gerhard Heller. The Germans facilitated \"recreational visits\" in Paris for their troops, promoting the motto \"Jeder einmal in Paris\" (everyone once in Paris). The widespread prostitution during the occupation eventually led to the implementation of the Loi Marthe Richard in 1946, which closed bordellos and reduced stage shows to dancing events.\nIn 1944, shortly after the liberation of Paris, Edith Piaf, who had performed frequently at social gatherings for German forces during the war, returned to the stage at the Moulin Rouge. She was accompanied by Yves Montand, a newcomer chosen to perform with her.\nRenewal.\nOn 22 June 1951, Georges France, also known as Jo France, founder of the Balajo in Paris, acquired the Moulin Rouge and initiated extensive renovation efforts. Architects Pierre Devinoy, Bernard de La Tour d\u2019Auvergne, and Marion Tournon-Branly were tasked with enhancing and outfitting the new auditorium. The envisioned d\u00e9cor by Jo France, largely executed by Henri Mah\u00e9, a prominent designer of the era, remains intact to this day.\nThe return of evening dances, acts, and the iconic French cancan marked a revival at the Moulin Rouge. On 19 May 1953, the 25th \"Bal des Petits Lits Blancs,\" organized by novelist Guy des Cars, attracted notable figures such as French President Vincent Auriol and featured Bing Crosby's European stage debut. Between 1951 and 1960, the stage saw performances by renowned artists including Luis Mariano, Charles Tr\u00e9net, and Josephine Baker.\nIn 1955, Jo France transferred ownership to brothers Joseph and Louis Cl\u00e9rico, proprietors of Le Lido, with Jean Bauchet assuming the managerial role. The tradition of the French cancan continued, choreographed by Ruggero Angeletti. Doris Haug established the \"Doris's Girls\" troop in 1957, initially comprising four girls and later expanding to sixty.\nTransformations in 1959 included renovations to the Moulin Rouge's kitchens, while the introduction of \"The Revue Japonaise\" in 1960 showcased Japanese artists and popularized Kabuki in Montmartre. In 1962, Jacki Cl\u00e9rico, son of Joseph Cl\u00e9rico, assumed leadership, ushering in an era of expansion with the enlargement of the auditorium, installation of a giant aquarium, and the introduction of the first aquatic ballet. \"The Revue Cancan\", devised by Doris Haug and Ruggero Angeletti, premiered the same year.\nSince 1963, following the success of the Frou-Frou revue, Jacki Cl\u00e9rico adopted a tradition of naming revues with titles beginning with the letter F. Throughout these productions, the famed French cancan remained a staple feature:\n* 1963\u20131965: \"Frou-Frou\"\n* 1965\u20131967: \"Frisson\"\n* 1967\u20131970: \"Fascination\"\n* 1970\u20131973: \"Fantastic\"\n* 1973\u20131976: \"Festival\"\n* 1976\u20131978: \"Follement\"\n* 1978\u20131983: \"Fr\u00e9n\u00e9sie\"\n* 1983\u20131988: \"Femmes, femmes, femmes\"\n* 1988\u20131999: \"Formidable\"\n* Since 1999: \"F\u00e9erie\"\nOn 7 September 1979, the Moulin Rouge marked its 90th anniversary, reaffirming its status as a prominent fixture in Parisian nightlife. The celebration featured an array of stars, including Ginger Rogers, Thierry Le Luron, Dalida, and Charles Aznavour, among others. Notable events followed, including a special presentation of the show to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on 23 November 1981. The venue hosted renowned performers such as Liza Minnelli in February 1982, followed by gala performances with Dean Martin in July 1984 and Frank Sinatra in September 1984. A milestone occurred on 1 December 1986, when world-renowned dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov premiered an original ballet by Maurice B\u00e9jart at the Moulin Rouge.\nIn February 1988, despite the original building's destruction in 1915, the Moulin Rouge celebrated its centenary with the premiere of the revue \"Formidable,\" a prestigious event attended by Prince Edward. Subsequent events included performances in London and gala celebrations featuring an array of luminaries, including Charles Aznavour, Ella Fitzgerald, and Jerry Lewis. Over the years, the Moulin Rouge continued to host charitable events, such as the Cartier gala in support of the Artists' Foundation against AIDS in 1994, and the Lanc\u00f4me gala in 1995. The centenary revue \"Formidable\" concluded in November 1999, paving the way for the debut of the new revue \"F\u00e9erie\" in December 1999.\nIn 2008, soloist dancer Aleksandar Josipovi\u0107 served as master of ceremonies at the 53rd Eurovision Song Contest. The venue's global reach extended further in February 2009 when it was showcased as part of the Year of France in Brazil and the Rio Carnival on Copacabana Beach. However, on 13 January 2013, Moulin Rouge owner Jacki Cl\u00e9rico died, followed by the death of Doris Haug, founder of the Doris's Girls, on 10 August 2014. Despite these losses, the Moulin Rouge celebrated its 125th anniversary on 6 October 2014.\nOn 25 April 2024, the cabaret's windmill blades collapsed onto the street, resulting in damage to the facade. No injuries were reported. The windmill was restored on 5 July that year, in time for the Olympic torch relay that passed through the area on 15 July.\nLegacy.\nEnterprises.\nThe Moulin Rouge in Paris was a source of inspiration for:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "43487", "revid": "50953552", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43487", "title": "Probability density function", "text": "Description of continuous random distribution\nIn probability theory, a probability density function (PDF), density function, or density of an absolutely continuous random variable, is a function whose value at any given sample (or point) in the sample space (the set of possible values taken by the random variable) can be interpreted as providing a \"relative likelihood\" that the value of the random variable would be equal to that sample. Probability density is the probability per unit length, in other words. While the \"absolute likelihood\" for a continuous random variable to take on any particular value is zero, given there is an infinite set of possible values to begin with. Therefore, the value of the PDF at two different samples can be used to infer, in any particular draw of the random variable, how much more likely it is that the random variable would be close to one sample compared to the other sample.\nMore precisely, the PDF is used to specify the probability of the random variable falling \"within a particular range of values\", as opposed to taking on any one value. This probability is given by the integral of a continuous variable's PDF over that range, where the integral is the nonnegative area under the density function between the lowest and greatest values of the range. The PDF is nonnegative everywhere, and the area under the entire curve is equal to one, such that the probability of the random variable falling within the set of possible values is 100%.\nThe terms \"probability distribution function\" and \"probability function\" can also denote the probability density function. However, this use is not standard among probabilists and statisticians. In other sources, \"probability distribution function\" may be used when the probability distribution is defined as a function over general sets of values or it may refer to the cumulative distribution function (CDF), or it may be a probability mass function (PMF) rather than the density. \"Density function\" itself is also used for the probability mass function, leading to further confusion. In general the PMF is used in the context of discrete random variables (random variables that take values on a countable set), while the PDF is used in the context of continuous random variables.\nExample.\nSuppose bacteria of a certain species typically live 20 to 30 hours. The probability that a bacterium lives exactly 5 hours is equal to zero. A lot of bacteria live for approximately 5 hours, but there is no chance that any given bacterium dies at exactly 5.00... hours. However, the probability that the bacterium dies between 5 hours and 5.01 hours is quantifiable. Suppose the answer is 0.02 (i.e., 2%). Then, the probability that the bacterium dies between 5 hours and 5.001 hours should be about 0.002, since this time interval is one-tenth as long as the previous. The probability that the bacterium dies between 5 hours and 5.0001 hours should be about 0.0002, and so on.\nIn this example, the ratio (probability of living during an interval) / (duration of the interval) is approximately constant, and equal to 2 per hour (or 2 hour\u22121). For example, there is 0.02 probability of dying in the 0.01-hour interval between 5 and 5.01 hours, and (0.02 probability / 0.01 hours) = 2 hour\u22121. This quantity 2 hour\u22121 is called the probability density for dying at around 5 hours. Therefore, the probability that the bacterium dies at 5 hours can be written as (2 hour\u22121) \"dt\". This is the probability that the bacterium dies within an infinitesimal window of time around 5 hours, where \"dt\" is the duration of this window. For example, the probability that it lives longer than 5 hours, but shorter than (5 hours + 1 nanosecond), is (2 hour\u22121)\u00d7(1 nanosecond) \u2248 (using the unit conversion nanoseconds = 1 hour).\nThere is a probability density function \"f\" with \"f\"(5 hours) = 2 hour\u22121. The integral of \"f\" over any window of time (not only infinitesimal windows but also large windows) is the probability that the bacterium dies in that window.\nAbsolutely continuous univariate distributions.\nA probability density function is most commonly associated with absolutely continuous univariate distributions. A random variable formula_1 has density formula_2, where formula_2 is a non-negative Lebesgue-integrable function, if:\nformula_4\nHence, if formula_5 is the cumulative distribution function of formula_1, then:\nformula_7\nand (if formula_5 is differentiable at formula_9)\nformula_10\nIntuitively, one can think of formula_11 as being the probability of formula_1 falling within the infinitesimal interval formula_13.\nFormal definition.\nA random variable formula_1 with values in a measurable space formula_15 (usually formula_16 with the Borel sets as measurable subsets) has as probability distribution the pushforward measure \"X\"\u2217\"P\" on formula_15: the density of formula_1 with respect to a reference measure formula_19 on formula_15 is the Radon\u2013Nikodym derivative:\nformula_21\nThat is, \"f\" is any measurable function with the property that:\nformula_22 for any measurable set formula_23\nDiscussion.\nIn the continuous univariate case above, the reference measure is the Lebesgue measure. The probability mass function of a discrete random variable is the density with respect to the counting measure over the sample space (usually the set of integers, or some subset thereof).\nIt is not possible to define a density with reference to an arbitrary measure (e.g. one can not choose the counting measure as a reference for a continuous random variable). Furthermore, when it does exist, the density is almost unique, meaning that any two such densities coincide almost everywhere.\nFurther details.\nUnlike a probability, a probability density function can take on values greater than one; for example, the continuous uniform distribution on the interval [0, 1/2] has probability density \"f\"(\"x\") = 2 for 0 \u2264 \"x\" \u2264 1/2 and \"f\"(\"x\") = 0 elsewhere.\nThe standard normal distribution has probability densityformula_24\nIf a random variable \"X\" is given and its distribution admits a probability density function \"f\", then the expected value of \"X\" (if the expected value exists) can be calculated asformula_25\nNot every probability distribution has a density function: the distributions of discrete random variables do not; nor does the Cantor distribution, even though it has no discrete component, i.e., does not assign positive probability to any individual point.\nA distribution has a density function if its cumulative distribution function \"F\"(\"x\") is absolutely continuous. In this case: \"F\" is almost everywhere differentiable, and its derivative can be used as probability density:formula_26\nIf a probability distribution admits a density, then the probability of every one-point set {\"a\"} is zero; the same holds for finite and countable sets.\nTwo probability densities \"f\" and \"g\" represent the same probability distribution precisely if they differ only on a set of Lebesgue measure zero.\nIn the field of statistical physics, a non-formal reformulation of the relation above between the derivative of the cumulative distribution function and the probability density function is generally used as the definition of the probability density function. This alternate definition is the following:\nIf \"dt\" is an infinitely small number, the probability that \"X\" is included within the interval (\"t\", \"t\" + \"dt\") is equal to \"f\"(\"t\") \"dt\", or:\nformula_27\nLink between discrete and continuous distributions.\nIt is possible to represent certain discrete random variables as well as random variables involving both a continuous and a discrete part with a generalized probability density function using the Dirac delta function. (This is not possible with a probability density function in the sense defined above, it may be done with a distribution.) For example, consider a binary discrete random variable having the Rademacher distribution\u2014that is, taking \u22121 or 1 for values, with probability &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 each. The density of probability associated with this variable is:\nformula_28\nMore generally, if a discrete variable can take n different values among real numbers, then the associated probability density function is:\nformula_29\nwhere formula_30 are the discrete values accessible to the variable and formula_31 are the probabilities associated with these values.\nThis substantially unifies the treatment of discrete and continuous probability distributions. The above expression allows for determining statistical characteristics of such a discrete variable (such as the mean, variance, and kurtosis), starting from the formulas given for a continuous distribution of the probability.\nFamilies of densities.\nIt is common for probability density functions (and probability mass functions) to be parametrized\u2014that is, to be characterized by unspecified parameters. For example, the normal distribution is parametrized in terms of the mean and the variance, denoted by formula_19 and formula_33 respectively, giving the family of densities\nformula_34\nDifferent values of the parameters describe different distributions of different random variables on the same sample space (the same set of all possible values of the variable); this sample space is the domain of the family of random variables that this family of distributions describes. A given set of parameters describes a single distribution within the family sharing the functional form of the density. From the perspective of a given distribution, the parameters are constants, and terms in a density function that contain only parameters, but not variables, are part of the normalization factor of a distribution (the multiplicative factor that ensures that the area under the density\u2014the probability of \"something\" in the domain occurring\u2014 equals 1). This normalization factor is outside the kernel of the distribution.\nSince the parameters are constants, reparametrizing a density in terms of different parameters to give a characterization of a different random variable in the family, means simply substituting the new parameter values into the formula in place of the old ones.\nDensities associated with multiple variables.\nFor continuous random variables \"X\"1, ..., \"Xn\", it is also possible to define a probability density function associated to the set as a whole, often called joint probability density function. This density function is defined as a function of the n variables, such that, for any domain D in the n-dimensional space of the values of the variables \"X\"1, ..., \"Xn\", the probability that a realisation of the set variables falls inside the domain D is\nformula_35\nIf \"F\"(\"x\"1, ..., \"x\"\"n\") = Pr(\"X\"1 \u2264 \"x\"1, ..., \"X\"\"n\" \u2264 \"x\"\"n\") is the cumulative distribution function of the vector (\"X\"1, ..., \"X\"\"n\"), then the joint probability density function can be computed as a partial derivative\nformula_36\nMarginal densities.\nFor \"i\" = 1, 2, ..., \"n\", let \"f\"\"X\"\"i\"(\"x\"\"i\") be the probability density function associated with variable \"Xi\" alone. This is called the marginal density function, and can be deduced from the probability density associated with the random variables \"X\"1, ..., \"Xn\" by integrating over all values of the other \"n\" \u2212 1 variables:\nformula_37\nIndependence.\nContinuous random variables \"X\"1, ..., \"Xn\" admitting a joint density are all independent from each other if\nformula_38\nCorollary.\nIf the joint probability density function of a vector of n random variables can be factored into a product of n functions of one variable\nformula_39\n(where each \"fi\" is not necessarily a density) then the n variables in the set are all independent from each other, and the marginal probability density function of each of them is given by\nformula_40\nExample.\nThis elementary example illustrates the above definition of multidimensional probability density functions in the simple case of a function of a set of two variables. Let us call formula_41 a 2-dimensional random vector of coordinates (\"X\", \"Y\"): the probability to obtain formula_41 in the quarter plane of positive \"x\" and \"y\" is\nformula_43\nFunction of random variables and change of variables in the probability density function.\nIf the probability density function of a random variable (or vector) \"X\" is given as \"fX\"(\"x\"), it is possible (but often not necessary; see below) to calculate the probability density function of some variable \"Y\" = \"g\"(\"X\"). This is also called a \"change of variable\" and is in practice used to generate a random variable of arbitrary shape \"f\"\"g\"(\"X\") = \"fY\" using a known (for instance, uniform) random number generator.\nIt is tempting to think that in order to find the expected value E(\"g\"(\"X\")), one must first find the probability density \"f\"\"g\"(\"X\") of the new random variable \"Y\" = \"g\"(\"X\"). However, rather than computing\nformula_44\none may find instead\nformula_45\nThe values of the two integrals are the same in all cases in which both \"X\" and \"g\"(\"X\") actually have probability density functions. It is not necessary that \"g\" be a one-to-one function. In some cases the latter integral is computed much more easily than the former. See Law of the unconscious statistician.\nScalar to scalar.\nLet formula_46 be a monotonic function, then the resulting density function is\nformula_47\nHere \"g\"\u22121 denotes the inverse function.\nThis follows from the fact that the probability contained in a differential area must be invariant under change of variables. That is,\nformula_48\nor\nformula_49\nFor functions that are not monotonic, the probability density function for y is\nformula_50\nwhere \"n\"(\"y\") is the number of solutions in x for the equation formula_51, and formula_52 are these solutions.\nVector to vector.\nSuppose x is an n-dimensional random variable with joint density \"f\". If y = \"G\"(x), where \"G\" is a bijective, differentiable function, then y has density :\nformula_53\nwith the differential regarded as the Jacobian of the inverse of \"G\"(\u22c5), evaluated at y.\nFor example, in the 2-dimensional case x = (\"x\"1, \"x\"2), suppose the transform \"G\" is given as \"y\"1 = \"G\"1(\"x\"1, \"x\"2), \"y\"2 = \"G\"2(\"x\"1, \"x\"2) with inverses \"x\"1 = \"G\"1\u22121(\"y\"1, \"y\"2), \"x\"2 = \"G\"2\u22121(\"y\"1, \"y\"2). The joint distribution for y\u00a0= (\"y\"1,\u00a0y2) has density\nformula_54\nVector to scalar.\nLet formula_55 be a differentiable function and formula_56 be a random vector taking values in formula_57, formula_58 be the probability density function of formula_56 and formula_60 be the Dirac delta function. It is possible to use the formulas above to determine formula_61, the probability density function of formula_62, which will be given by\nformula_63\nThis result leads to the law of the unconscious statistician:\nformula_64\nwhich is an upper triangular matrix with ones on the main diagonal, therefore its determinant is 1. Applying the change of variable theorem from the previous section we obtain that\nformula_65\nwhich if marginalized over formula_9 leads to the desired probability density function.\nSums of independent random variables.\nThe probability density function of the sum of two independent random variables \"U\" and \"V\", each of which has a probability density function, is the convolution of their separate density functions:\nformula_67\nIt is possible to generalize the previous relation to a sum of N independent random variables, with densities \"U\"1, ..., \"UN\":\nformula_68\nThis can be derived from a two-way change of variables involving \"Y\" = \"U\" + \"V\" and \"Z\" = \"V\", similarly to the example below for the quotient of independent random variables.\nProducts and quotients of independent random variables.\nGiven two independent random variables \"U\" and \"V\", each of which has a probability density function, the density of the product \"Y\" = \"UV\" and quotient \"Y\" = \"U\"/\"V\" can be computed by a change of variables.\nExample: Quotient distribution.\nTo compute the quotient \"Y\" = \"U\"/\"V\" of two independent random variables \"U\" and \"V\", define the following transformation:\nformula_69\nThen, the joint density \"p\"(\"y\",\"z\") can be computed by a change of variables from \"U\",\"V\" to \"Y\",\"Z\", and \"Y\" can be derived by marginalizing out \"Z\" from the joint density.\nThe inverse transformation is\nformula_70\nThe absolute value of the Jacobian matrix determinant formula_71 of this transformation is:\nformula_72\nThus:\nformula_73\nAnd the distribution of \"Y\" can be computed by marginalizing out \"Z\":\nformula_74\nThis method crucially requires that the transformation from \"U\",\"V\" to \"Y\",\"Z\" be bijective. The above transformation meets this because \"Z\" can be mapped directly back to \"V\", and for a given \"V\" the quotient \"U\"/\"V\" is monotonic. This is similarly the case for the sum \"U\" + \"V\", difference \"U\" \u2212 \"V\" and product \"UV\".\nExactly the same method can be used to compute the distribution of other functions of multiple independent random variables.\nExample: Quotient of two standard normals.\nGiven two standard normal variables \"U\" and \"V\", the quotient can be computed as follows. First, the variables have the following density functions:\nformula_75\nWe transform as described above:\nformula_69\nThis leads to:\nformula_77\nThis is the density of a standard Cauchy distribution.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "43488", "revid": "20318", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43488", "title": "Rave", "text": "Dance party\nA rave (from the verb: \"to rave\") is a dance party at a warehouse, club, or other public or private venue, typically featuring performances by DJs playing electronic dance music. The style is most associated with the early 1990s dance music scene when DJs played at illegal events in musical styles dominated by electronic dance music from a wide range of sub-genres, including drum and bass, dubstep, trap, break, happy hardcore, trance, techno, hardcore, house, and alternative dance. Occasionally live musicians have been known to perform at raves, in addition to other types of performance artists such as go-go dancers and fire dancers. The music is amplified with a large, powerful sound reinforcement system, typically with large subwoofers to produce a deep bass sound. The music is often accompanied by laser light shows, projected coloured images, visual effects and fog machines.\nFuelled by the emerging dance scene, and spearheaded by acid house music and underground bands such as The Prodigy, many of the \"acid house\" parties were held in squats during the late 1980s. Well known locations such as the \"Dole House\" (Peckham), the abandoned bus station and the squatted children's home in Camberwell known as Groove Park had crowds of over a thousand. Full Moon parties were organised at Groove Park by Pete Marland (who went on to start the dance scene in Western Ireland in the early 1990s) and multiple events went on for over a year as an Art Collective sanctioned by locals. The Times' first colour supplement carried an article about the dance scene at Groove Park, though some of the organisers did not want to be photographed. While some raves may be small parties held at nightclubs or private homes, some others have grown to immense size, such as the large festivals and events featuring multiple DJs and dance areas (e.g., the Castlemorton Common Festival in 1992).\nSome electronic dance music festivals have features of raves, but on a larger, often commercial scale. Raves may last for a long time, with some events continuing for twenty-four hours, and lasting all through the night. Law enforcement raids and anti-rave laws have presented a challenge to the rave scene in many countries. This is due to the association of rave culture with illegal drugs such as MDMA (often referred to as a \"club drug\" or \"party drug\" along with MDA), amphetamine, LSD, GHB, ketamine, methamphetamine, cocaine, and cannabis. In addition to drugs, raves often make use of non-authorized, secret venues, such as squat parties at unoccupied homes, unused warehouses, or aircraft hangars. These concerns are often attributed to a type of moral panic surrounding rave culture.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nOrigins and Etymology (1950s\u20131970s).\nIn the late 1950s in London, England, the term \"rave\" was used to describe the \"wild bohemian parties\" of the Soho beatnik set. Jazz musician Mick Mulligan, known for indulging in such excesses, had the nickname \"king of the ravers\". In 1958, Buddy Holly recorded the hit \"Rave On\", citing the madness and frenzy of a feeling and the desire for it never to end. The word \"rave\" was later used in the burgeoning mod youth culture of the early 1960s as the way to describe any wild party in general. People who were gregarious party animals were described as \"ravers\". Pop musicians such as Steve Marriott of Small Faces and Keith Moon of the Who were self-described \"ravers\". In 1965, the Grateful Dead served as the backing band for the San Francisco Acid Tests, which were LSD drug parties organized by Ken Kesey. Subsequently, visual artist Andy Warhol later organized the Exploding Plastic Inevitable in New York, a multimedia event backed with performances by the Velvet Underground and Nico, the event was characterized by flashing lights, loud music, dancing and heavy drug use. During the psychedelic era, happenings became a common fixture of the counterculture. This later culminated in the massive social phenomenon known as the Summer of Love. The phrase \"Summer of Love\" was used once again during the advent of rave culture in the 1980s, referring to the \"Second Summer of Love\".\nPresaging the word's subsequent 1980s association with electronic music, the word \"rave\" was a common term used regarding the music of mid-1960s garage rock and psychedelia bands (most notably the Yardbirds, who released an album in the United States called \"Having a Rave Up\"). Along with being an alternative term for partying at such garage events in general, the \"rave-up\" referred to a specific crescendo moment near the end of a song where the music was played faster, more heavily and with intense soloing or elements of controlled feedback. It was later part of the title of an electronic music performance event held on 28 January 1967 at London's Roundhouse titled the \"Million Volt Light and Sound Rave\". The event featured the only known public airing of an experimental sound collage created for the occasion by Paul McCartney of the Beatles \u2013 the legendary \"Carnival of Light\" recording.\nWith the rapid change of British pop culture from the mod era of 1963\u20131966 to the hippie era of 1967 and beyond, the term fell out of popular usage. The Northern soul movement is cited by many as being a significant step towards the creation of contemporary club culture and of the superstar DJ culture of the 2000s. As in contemporary club culture, Northern soul DJs built up a following based on satisfying the crowd's desires for music that they could not hear anywhere else. Many argue that Northern soul was instrumental in creating a network of clubs, DJs, record collectors and dealers in the UK, and was the first music scene to provide the British charts with records that sold entirely on the strength of club play.\nA technique employed by northern soul DJs in common with their later counterparts was the sequencing of records to create euphoric highs and lows for the crowd; DJ Laurence 'Larry' Proxton was known for using this method. DJ personalities and their followers involved in the original Northern soul movement went on to become important figures in the house and dance music scenes. During the 1970s and early 1980s until its resurrection, the term was not in vogue, one notable exception being in the lyrics of the song \"Drive-In Saturday\" by David Bowie (from his 1973 album \"Aladdin Sane\") which includes the line, \"It's a crash course for the ravers.\" Its use during that era would have been perceived as a quaint or ironic use of bygone slang: part of the dated 1960s lexicon along with words such as \"groovy\".\nThe perception of the word \"rave\" changed again in the late 1980s when the term was revived and adopted by a new youth culture, possibly inspired by the use of the term in Jamaica.\nAcid house (1980s).\nIn the mid to late 1980s, a wave of psychedelic and other electronic dance music, most notably acid house music, emerged from acid house music parties in the mid-to-late 1980s in the Chicago area in the United States. After Chicago acid house artists began experiencing overseas success, acid house quickly spread and caught on in the United Kingdom within clubs, warehouses and free-parties, first in Manchester in the mid-1980s and then later in London. In the late 1980s, the word \"rave\" was adopted to describe the subculture that grew out of the acid house movement. Activities were related to the party atmosphere of Ibiza, a Mediterranean island in Spain, frequented by British, Italian, Greek, Irish and German youth on vacation, who would hold raves and dance parties.\nGrowth (1990s\u2013present).\nBy the 1990s, genres such as acid, breakbeat hardcore, hardcore, happy hardcore, gabber, drum and bass, post-industrial and electronica were all being featured at raves, both large and small. There were mainstream events which attracted thousands of people (up to 25,000 instead of the 4,000 that came to earlier warehouse parties). Acid house music parties were first re-branded \"rave parties\" in the media, during the summer of 1989 by Genesis P-Orridge during a television interview; however, the ambience of the rave was not fully formed until the early 1990s. In 1990, raves were held \"underground\" in several cities, such as Berlin, Milan and Patras, in basements, warehouses and forests.\nBritish politicians responded with hostility to the emerging rave party trend. Politicians spoke out against raves and began to fine promoters who held unauthorised parties. Police crackdowns on these often unauthorised parties drove the rave scene into the countryside. The word \"rave\" somehow caught on in the UK to describe common semi-spontaneous weekend parties occurring at various locations linked by the brand new M25 London orbital motorway that ringed London and the Home Counties; it was this that gave the band Orbital their name. These ranged from former warehouses and industrial sites in London, to fields and country clubs in the countryside.\nCharacteristics.\nMusic.\nRave music may either refer to the late 1980s/early 1990s genres of house, new beat, breakbeat, acid house, techno and hardcore techno, which were the first genres of music to be played at rave parties, or to any other genre of electronic dance music (EDM) that may be played at a rave.\nThe genre \"rave\", also known as hardcore (not to be confused with other \"hardcore\" music genres) by early ravers, first appeared amongst the UK \"acid\" movement during the late 1980s at warehouse parties and other underground venues, as well as on UK pirate radio stations. Another genre called \"rave\" during the early 1990s, was the Belgian hardcore techno music that emerged from new beat, when techno became the main style in the Belgian EDM scene.\nThe \"rave\" genre would develop into oldschool hardcore, which lead onto newer forms of rave music such as drum and bass, 2-step and happy hardcore as well as other hardcore techno genres, such as gabber and hardstyle.\nRave music is usually presented in a DJ mix set, although live performances are not uncommon.\nStyles of music include:\nDowntempo and less dance-oriented styles which are sometimes called chill-out music, that might be heard in a rave \"chill-out\" room or at a rave that plays slower electronic music includes:\nLocation.\nRaves have historically referred to grassroots organised, anti-establishment and unlicensed all\u2010night dance parties. Prior to the commercialisation of the rave scene, when large legal venues became the norm for these events, the location of the rave was kept secret until the night of the event, usually being communicated through answering machine messages, mobile messaging, secret flyers, and websites. This level of secrecy, necessary for avoiding any interference by the police, also on account of the illicit drug use, enabled the ravers to use locations they could stay in for ten hours at a time. It promoted the sense of deviance and removal from social control. In the 2000s, this level of secrecy still exists in the underground rave scene. However \"after-hours\" clubs, as well as large outdoor events, create a similar type of alternate atmosphere, but focus much more on vibrant visual effects, such as props and d\u00e9cor. In more recent years, large commercial events are held at the same locations year after year with similar reoccurring themes every year. Events like Electric Daisy Carnival and Tomorrowland are typically held at the same venue that holds mass numbers of people.\nSome raves make use of pagan symbolism. Modern raving venues attempt to immerse the raver in a fantasy-like world. Indigenous imagery and spirituality can be characteristic in the Raving ethos. In both the New Moon and Gateway collectives, \"pagan altars are set up, sacred images from primitive cultures decorate the walls, and rituals of cleansing are performed over the turntables and the dance floor\" This type of spatial strategy is an integral part of the raving experience because it sets the initial \"vibe\" in which the ravers will immerse themselves. This said \"vibe\" is a concept in the raver ethos that represents the allure and receptiveness of an environment's portrayed and or innate energy. The landscape is an integral feature in the composition of rave, much like it is in pagan rituals. For example, The Numic Ghost Dancers rituals were held on specific geographical sites, considered to hold powerful natural flows of energy. These sites were later represented in the rhythmic dances, to achieve a greater level of connectivity.\nThe Falls festival in Byron Bay features a rave party hidden behind a washing machine in a laundromat.\nNotable venues.\nThe following is an incomplete list of venues associated with the rave subculture:\nDancing.\nA sense of participation in a group event is among the chief appeals of rave music and dancing to pulsating beats is its immediate outlet. Raving in itself is a syllabus-free dance, whereby the movements are not predefined and the dance is performed randomly, dancers take immediate inspiration from the music, their mood and watching other people dancing. Thus, the electronic, rave and club dances, also known as Post-Internet Dances refer to the street dance styles that evolved alongside electronic music culture.\nA common feature shared by all these dances, along with being originated at clubs, raves and music festivals around the world and in different years, is that when YouTube and other social media started to become popular (around 2006), these dances began to be popularised by videos of raves.\nAttire.\nSince the late 1980s, rave fashion has undergone constant evolution with each new generation of ravers. Many of the rave fashion trends have appeared internationally, but there were also individual developments from region to region and from scene to scene.\nAt early rave parties, often costume-like clothes and garments with signal color look such as protective suits, safety vests, dust and gas masks were worn and combined with accessories such as vacuum cleaners or cyberpunk inspired goggles. Clothing with slogans such as \"Peace, Love, Unity\" and smiley-face T-shirts first appeared with the acid house movement of the 1980s. Further popular themes of the early rave scene were plastic aesthetics, various fetish styles, DIY, 1970s, second-hand optics, retro sportswear (such as Adidas tracksuits), sex (showing much skin and nudity, e.g. wearing transparent or crop tops), war (e.g. in the form of combat boots or camouflage trousers), and science fiction.\nCommon fashion styles of the 1990s include tight-fitting nylon shirts, tight nylon quilted vests, bell-bottoms, neoprene jackets, studded belts, platform shoes, jackets, scarves and bags made of flokati fur, fluffy boots and phat pants, often in bright and neon colours. Also gaudy coloured hair, dreadlocks, tattoos and piercings came into fashion with ravers. Widespread accessories included wristbands and collars, whistles, pacifiers, white gloves, glow sticks, feather boas, oversized sunglasses, and record bags made of truck tarpaulins. In the early 1990s the first commercial rave fashion trends developed from this, which were quickly taken up by the fashion industry and marketed under the term \"clubwear\". Different dress codes also evolved in the various sub-scenes of the rave culture. For example, the typical gabber or psytrance raver dressed significantly different from \"normal\" ravers, but common basic features remained recognisable.\nSince the 2000s, the clothing style of the rave culture remains heterogeneous, as do its followers. Particularly in North America, rave fashion continues to be characterised by colourful clothing and accessories, most notably the \"kandi\" jewellery that fluoresces under ultraviolet light. They contain words or phrases that are unique to the raver and that they can choose to trade with each other using \"PLUR\" (Peace, Love, Unity, Respect). This style of attire was again taken up by the fashion industry and marketed as \"rave fashion\" or \"festival fashion\", now includling all kinds of accessories to create unique looks depending on event. In contrast to this and starting at Berlin techno clubs like Berghain in the 2000s, a strictly black style, partly borrowed from the dark scene, has established itself within parts of the techno scene. Certain rave events such as Sensation also have a strict minimalistic dress policy, either all white or black attire.\nLight shows.\nSome ravers participate in one of four light-oriented dances, called \"glowsticking\", \"glowstringing\", \"gloving\", and \"lightshows\". Of the four types of light-orientated dances, gloving in particular has evolved far beyond the rave culture. Other types of light-related dancing include LED lights, flash-lights and blinking strobe lights. LEDs come in various colours with different settings.\nGloving has evolved into a separate dance form that has grown exponentially in the last couple of years early 2010. Glovers use their fingers and hands to move with the beat of the music. And they use the color to create patterns and have different speed settings for the lights on their gloves. These components give the glove artist different ways to fascinate spectators of their light shows. The use of lights can improve the way people react during the songs or throughout the concert itself. Since then the culture has extended to all ages, ranging from kids in their early teens to college students and more. The traditional Rave lights are limited now, but many stores have developed newer, brighter, and more advanced version of lights with a plethora of colours and modes\u2014modes include solid, stribbon, strobe, dops, hyper flash, and other variations.\nDrug use.\nAmong the various elements of 1970s disco subculture that ravers drew on, in addition to basing their scene around dance music mixed by DJs, ravers also inherited the positive attitude towards using club drugs to \"enhanc[e]...the sensory experience\" of dancing to loud music. The state of mind referred to as \"ecstasy\" (not to be confused with the slang term for MDMA) sought by ravers has been described as \"a result of when various factors harmonise the ego with the other elements such as place and music and [one] enter[s] a \"one state\" where [they] cannot distinguish what is material or not, where things enter into syntony and constitute a unique moment, precisely the kind sought in medi[t]ation\".\nHowever, disco dancers and ravers preferred different drugs. Whereas 1970s disco scene members preferred cocaine and the depressant/sedative Quaaludes, ravers preferred MDMA, 2C-B, amphetamine, and other pills. According to the FBI, raves are one of the most popular venues where club drugs are distributed, and as such feature a prominent drug subculture. Club drugs include MDMA (more commonly known as \"ecstasy\", \"E\" or \"molly\"), 2C-B (more commonly known as \"nexus\"), amphetamine (commonly referred to as \"speed\"), GHB (commonly referred to as \"fantasy\" or \"liquid E\"), cocaine (commonly referred to as \"coke\"), DMT, and LSD (commonly referred to as \"lucy\" or \"acid\").\n\"Poppers\" is the street name for alkyl nitrites (the most well-known being amyl nitrite), which are inhaled for their intoxicating effects, notably the \"rush\" or \"high\" they can provide. Nitrites originally came as small glass capsules that were popped open, which led to the nickname \"poppers.\" The drug became popular in the US first on the disco/club scene of the 1970s and then at dance and rave venues in the 1980s and 1990s. In the 2000s, synthetic phenethylamines such as 2C-I, 2C-B and DOB have been referred to as club drugs due to their stimulating and psychedelic nature (and their chemical relationship with MDMA). By late 2012, derivates of the psychedelic 2C-X drugs, the NBOMes and especially 25I-NBOMe, had become common at raves in Europe. In the U.S., some law enforcement agencies have branded the subculture as a drug-centric culture, as rave attendees have been known to use drugs such as cannabis, 2C-B, and DMT.\nSince the early 2000s, medical professionals have acknowledged and addressed the problem of the increasing consumption of alcoholic drinks and club drugs (such as MDMA, cocaine, rohypnol, GHB, ketamine, PCP, LSD, and methamphetamine) associated with rave culture among adolescents and young adults in the Western world. Studies have shown that adolescents are more likely than young adults to use multiple drugs, and the consumption of club drugs is highly associated with the presence of criminal behaviors and recent alcohol abuse or dependence. In May 2007, Antonio Maria Costa, executive director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, advocated drug testing on highways as a countermeasure against drug use at raves.\nMuch of the controversy, moral panic, and law enforcement attention directed at rave culture and its association with drug use may be due to reports of drug overdoses (particularly MDMA) at raves, concerts, and festivals.\nHistory by country.\nBelgium.\nThe Belgian rave scene and sound have their roots in the late 1980s Belgian EBM and New Beat scenes.\nOriginally created by DJs slowing down gay Hi-NRG 45rpm records to 33rpm to create a trance-dance groove, New Beat evolved into a native form of hardcore techno in the 1990s with the introduction of techno records played at their original speeds or even slightly accelerated. This brutal new hardcore style spread throughout the European rave circuit and penetrated the pop charts.\nThe musical contribution of Brooklyn's DJ-producer Joey Beltram to R&amp;S Records, run by Renaat Vandepapeliere, was instrumental in the development of iconic Belgian techno sounds and anthems.\nCanada.\nExodus Productions was arguably the first production company in Canada to throw regular rave style events at the warehouse space known as 23 Hop, located at 318 Richmond Street West in Toronto's Entertainment District. The first party was held on 31 August 1991. Multiple production companies would quickly follow suit, and the rave scene would soon explode into a massive scene, with 23 Hop as the initial launching pad, until its closure in 1995. The documentary film \"The Legend of 23 Hop\" highlighted the early stages of Exodus and similarly modelled production companies. Notable DJs that performed at 23 Hop included Moby, Mark Oliver, Dino &amp; Terry, Sean L., Dr. No, Malik X, DJ Ruffneck, Jungle PhD, Kenny Glasgow, Matt C, John E, Danny Henry and David Crooke.\nIn 2001 Calgary, Alberta became the first major municipality in Canada to pass a bylaw with respect to raves. The intent of the bylaw was to ensure that raves would be safe for participants, and also not unduly disruptive to adjacent neighbourhoods. The bylaw was created in consultation with representatives from the municipality, the province of Alberta, and the rave community.\nGermany.\nIn West Germany and West Berlin, a substantial acid house scene had established itself in the late 1980s. In the West Berlin club Ufo, an illegal party venue located in the basement of an old apartment building, the first acid house parties took place in 1988. In Munich at this time, the \"Negerhalle\" (1983\u20131989) and the \"ETA-Halle\" established themselves as the first acid house clubs in temporarily used, dilapidated industrial halls, marking the beginning of the so-called hall culture in Germany. In July 1989, the first Love Parade took place in West Berlin.\nImmediately after the Berlin Wall fell on 9 November 1989, free underground techno parties mushroomed in East Berlin. According to East German DJ Paul van Dyk the techno-based rave scene was a major force in re-establishing social connections between East and West Germany during the unification period. Soon the first techno clubs emerged in East Berlin such as the Tresor (est. 1991), the \"Planet\" (1991\u20131993), and the Bunker (1992\u20131996). In Frankfurt, the Omen opened in 1988, which under its operator Sven V\u00e4th became the center of the scene in the Rhein-Main area in the following years. In 1990, the Babalu Club opened in Munich, introducing the concept of afterhours in Germany.\nIn the late 1990s, the venues \"Tresor\" and E-Werk (1993\u20131997) in Berlin, \"Omen\" (1988\u20131998) and Dorian Gray (1978\u20132000) in Frankfurt, Ultraschall (1994\u20132003), KW \u2013 Das Heizkraftwerk (1996\u20132003) and Natraj Temple (1996\u20132008) in Munich, as well as \"Stammheim\" (1994\u20132002) in Kassel, had established themselves as the most renowned techno clubs in Germany.\nParallel to the established club scene, illegal raves remained an integral part of the German rave scene throughout the 1990s. In urbanised Germany illegal raves and techno parties often preferred industrial sceneries such as decommissioned power stations, factories, the canalisation or former military properties of the cold war.\nIn the course of the 1990s, rave culture became part of a new youth movement in Germany and Europe. DJs and electronic-music producers such as WestBam proclaimed the existence of a \"raving society\" and promoted electronic music as legitimate competition for rock and roll. Indeed, electronic dance music and rave subculture became mass movements. Since the mid-1990s, raves had tens of thousands of attendees, youth magazines featured styling tips, and television networks launched music magazines on house and techno music. The annual Love Parade festivals in Berlin and later the Metropolitan Ruhr area repeatedly attracted more than one million party-goers between 1997 and 2010. Dozens of other annual technoparades took place in Germany and Central Europe in the 1990s and early 2000s, the largest ones being Union Move, Generation Move, Reincarnation and Vision Parade as well as Street Parade and Lake Parade in Switzerland. Large commercial raves since the nineties include Mayday, Nature One, Time Warp, SonneMondSterne and Melt!.\nSince the late 2000s, Berlin is still called the capital of techno and rave, and techno clubs such as Berghain, Tresor, KitKatClub or \"Watergate\" and the way to party in barely renovated venues, ruins or wooden shacks such as, among many others, Club der Visionaere, \"Wilde Renate\", or Bar 25, attracted international media attention. One movie that portraits the scene of the 2000s is Berlin Calling starring Paul Kalkbrenner. In the 2010s, there continued to be a vivid rave and techno scene throughout the country, including numerous festivals and world-class techno clubs also outside of Berlin, such as for example MMA Club and Blitz Club in Munich, \"Institut f\u00fcr Zukunft\" in Leipzig or \"Robert Johnson\" in Offenbach.\nUnited Kingdom.\nBirth of UK rave scene (1980s\u20131990s).\nThe UK was finally recognised for its rave culture in the late 1980s and early 1990s. By 1991, organisations such as Fantazia and Raindance were holding massive legal raves in fields and warehouses around the country. The Fantazia party at Castle Donington, July 1992 was an open-air, all-night event. The Vision at Pophams airfield in August 1992 and Universe's Tribal Gathering in 1993 had a more festival feel.\nBy the middle of 1992, the scene was slowly changing, with local councils passing by-laws and increasing fees in an effort to prevent or discourage rave organisations from acquiring necessary licences. This meant that the days of the large one-off parties were numbered. By the mid-1990s, the scene had also fragmented into many different styles of dance music, making large parties more expensive to set up and more difficult to promote. The sound driving the big raves of the early 1990s had by the end of 1993 split into two distinct and polarising styles, the darker jungle and the faster happy hardcore. Although many ravers left the scene due to the split, promoters such as ESP Dreamscape and Helter Skelter still enjoyed widespread popularity and capacity attendances with multi-arena events catering to the various genres. Notable events of this period included ESP's outdoor Dreamscape 20 event on 9 September 1995 at Brafield aerodrome fields, Northants and Helter Skelter's Energy 97 outdoor event on 9 August 1997 at Turweston Aerodrome, Northants.\nFree parties and outlawing of raves (1992\u20131994).\nThe illegal free party scene also reached its zenith for that time after a particularly large festival, when many individual sound systems such as Bedlam, Circus Warp, DIY, and Spiral Tribe set up near Castlemorton Common. The government acted. Under the \"Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994\", the definition of music played at a rave was given as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Music\" includes sounds wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats.\u2014\u200a\nSections 63, 64 and 65 of the Act targeted electronic dance music played at raves. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act empowered police to stop a rave in the open air when a hundred or more people are attending, or where two or more are making preparations for a rave. Section 65 allows any uniformed constable who believes a person is on their way to a rave within a five-mile radius to stop them and direct them away from the area; non-compliant citizens may be subject to a maximum fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale (\u00a31000). The Act was officially introduced because of the noise and disruption caused by all night parties to nearby residents, and to protect the countryside. However, some participants in the scene claimed it was an attempt to lure youth culture away from MDMA and back to taxable alcohol. In November 1994, the Zippies staged an act of electronic civil disobedience to protest against the CJB (i.e., Criminal Justice Bill).\nLegal and underground raves (1994\u2013present).\nAfter 1993, the main outlet for raves in the UK were a number of licensed parties, amongst them Helter Skelter, Life at Bowlers (Trafford Park, Manchester), The Edge (formerly the Eclipse [Coventry]), The Sanctuary (Milton Keynes) and Club Kinetic. In London, itself, there were a few large clubs that staged raves on a regular basis, most notably \"The Laser Dome\", \"The Fridge\", \"The Hippodrome\", \"Club U.K.\", and \"Trade.\" \"The Laser Dome\" featured two separate dance areas, \"Hardcore\" and \"Garage\", as well as over 20 video game machines, a silent-movie screening lounge, replicas of the \"Statue of Liberty\", \"San Francisco Bridge\", and a large glass maze. In Scotland, event promoters Rezerection held large-scale events across the country.\nBy 1997, the popularity of weekly Superclub nights had taken over from the old Rave format, with a raft of new club-based genres sweeping in (e.g. Trance, Hard House, Speed and UK garage) alongside the more traditional House sound that had regained popularity. Clubs like Gatecrasher and Cream rose to prominence with dress codes and door policies that were the polar opposite of their rave counterparts; stories of refused entry due to not wearing the right clothing were commonplace, but seemingly did nothing to deter Superclub attendance.\nIllegal lockdown gatherings.\nIn August 2020, following a proliferation of illegal gatherings, the British government introduced additional legislation allowing police to issue organisers of illegal gatherings with fines of \u00a310,000.\nUnited States.\nOrigins in disco and psychedelia (1970s).\nThe American electronic dance music scene is one of the earliest, and rave culture has its roots in the \"circuit parties\" and disco clubs of the late 1970s. These were scattered in cities large and small throughout the United States, from Buffalo to Cleveland to Aspen, Colorado. Cities like Chicago, Detroit, Miami, and New York City soon saw the rise of electronic music genres foundational to rave culture, such as house music, techno, and breakbeat. American ravers, like their UK and European counterparts, have been compared to the hippies of the 1960s due to their shared interest in non-violence and psychedelia. Rave culture incorporated disco culture's same love of dance music spun by DJs, drug exploration, sexual promiscuity, and hedonism. Although disco culture had thrived in the mainstream, the rave culture would make an effort to stay underground to avoid the animosity that was still surrounding disco and dance music. The key motive for remaining underground in many parts of the US had to do with curfew and the standard 2:00\u00a0am closing of clubs. It was a desire to keep the party going past legal hours that created the underground direction. Because of the legality, they had to be secretive about time and place.\nGrowth in Chicago (1980s).\nWithin the early 1980s Chicago created \"House music\" and quickly grew with the city. This music scene has been one of the earliest and most influential scenes in dance music history. Frankie Knuckles also known as \"Godfather of House Music\" who was a dj-producer that was considered to have invented \"Chicago House Music\". He would mix a range of disco classics, indie-label soul tunes, European synth-disco that is now considered to be \"House Music\". Frankie played his house beats at The Warehouse (1977\u20131982) that was a club for members only, that attracted many black gay men but his music gained a wider crowd which then attracted straighter, whiter crowds. Leading its owner of the club, Robert Williams, to get rid of memberships entirely. Frankie left to create his own club called, \"Power Plant\" (1983\u20131985) which gained the attention of an entirely diverse crowd. He created his House music by using his own edits and extending the grooves within the tunes to keep the dance floor filled all-night. Ultimately, this phenomenon spread exponentially throughout Chicago during 1986\u20131987. Chicago house influenced music which is what created \"House Music\" in England during 1986 this is what grew into Electronic Dance Music today.\nNew York Raves and Party Promoters (1980s).\nIn the late 1980s, rave culture began to filter through into North America from English expatriates and from US DJs who would visit Europe. However, rave culture's major expansion in North America is often credited to Frankie Bones, who after spinning a party in an aircraft hangar in England, helped organise some of the earliest American raves in the 1990s in New York City called \"Storm Raves\". Storm Raves had a consistent core audience, fostered by zines by fellow Storm DJ (and co-founder, with Adam X and Frankie Bones, of the US techno record store, Groove Records). Heather Heart held Under One Sky. Simultaneously in NYC, events were introducing electronic dance music to this city's dance scene. Between 1992 and 1994, promotional groups sprung up across the east coast.\nSouthern California and Latin America (1990s).\nIn the 1990s, San Diego held large raves with audiences of thousands. These festivals were held on Indian reservations and ski resorts during the summer months and were headlined by DJs such as Doc Martin, Daniel Moontribe, Dimitri of Deee-lite, Afrika Islam and the Hardkiss brothers from San Francisco. They helped to create the Right to Dance movement\u2014a non-violent protest held in San Diego and later in Los Angeles.\nFeaturing local San Diego DJs Jon Bishop, Steve Pagan, Alien Tom, Jeff Skot, Jon-e Thin, Paolo, Merlyn, Gmaxim, Tony Fiore, Damon and Mark E. Quark performed at these events. The events used large props and themes. The fairy and pixie craze, with ravers getting fairy tattoos and wearing fairy wings to parties was associated with the region. The percussive group Crash Worship was active here.\nIn 1993 out of the Los Angeles underground rave movement came Moontribe the original Southern California Full Moon Gathering and featured Dj's Daniel Moontribe (aka Daniel Chavez aka Dcomplex aka Dcomplexity) and more.\nGrowth in California.\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a boom in rave culture in the San Francisco Bay Area. At first, small underground parties sprung up all over the SOMA district in vacant warehouses, loft spaces, and clubs. The no alcohol rule fuelled the ecstasy-driven parties. Small underground raves were just starting out and expanding beyond SF to include the East Bay, the South Bay area including San Jose, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz beaches.\nIn late 1991, raves started to expand across northern California, and cities like Sacramento, Oakland, Silicon Valley (Palo Alto, San Jose). The massive parties were taking place in outdoor fields, aeroplane hangars and hilltops that surround the valley. San Francisco's early promoters and DJs were from the UK and Europe. Raves took place in some of the SOMA art museum event such as, 'Where the wild things are' in the museum on top of the Sony Metreon, and in the Maritime hall (1998\u20132002).\nBy the end of 1994, a new generation of ravers were attracted by the new sounds. EDM began to become popular. Raves could be found in many different kinds of venues, as opposed to just basements and warehouses. Promoters started to take notice and put together the massives of the late 1990s with many music forms under one roof for 12-hour events. Until 2003, the raves scene continued to grow slow and stay stable until there was increasingly awareness and publicity about illicit drug usage at raves, particularly ecstasy. Parallel to the rave scene growth, was an increase in anti drug policies, which were directly aimed and indirectly influenced rave organizational management and event. On 30 April 2003, the US Congress passed the Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act, which has origins from a similarly purposed, but not passed, 2002 bill. That bill is notably named The RAVE Act. Consequentially, by mid 2000s and late 2000s larger raves appeared more sporadically. Nevertheless, and parallel to new city ordinances regarding curfews and drug enforcement, rave event promoter companies like Go ventures and Insomniac persisted and continued annual scheduled rave events like Monster Massive, Together as One, and Electric Daisy Carnival. From this base of routine and consistency scheduled events, the rave scene reemerged with in 2010 with even more attendance and dance locations. The overwhelming attendance, including from lack of underage attendance restrictions, reached a changing point with the 185,000 estimated in attendance 2010 Electric Daisy Carnival (EDC). That 2010 event gained widespread attention because of the death and overdose of a 15-year-old girl, Sasha Rodriguez. The death prompted an investigation of EDC's Insomniac's founder Pasquale Rotella. That investigation resulted in him being charged with bribery of public employee Todd DeStefano. At the time, DeStefano was the LA Coliseum event manager, which was the location of 2010's EDC. This in turn lead to a reorganisation of Insomniac rave events. For EDC in particular, while free on bail, Pasquale Rotella moved 2011's EDC from Los Angeles to Las Vegas from then on as well as increased the EDC scheduled locations. Rotella later reached a plea bargain and avoided jail time.\nSeattle.\nThrough the mid-1990s and into the 2000s the city of Seattle also shared in the tradition of West Coast rave culture. Though a smaller scene compared to San Francisco, Seattle also had many different rave crews, promoters, DJs, and fans. Candy Raver style, friendship and culture became popular in the West Coast rave scene, both in Seattle and San Francisco. At the peak of West Coast rave, Candy Raver, and massive rave popularity (1996\u20131999,) it was common to meet groups of ravers, promoters, and DJs who frequently travelled between Seattle and San Francisco, as well as Bellingham, Vancouver, Canada and Portland, Oregon. This spread the overall sense of West Coast rave culture and the phenomenon of West Coast \"massives\".\nRecent years (2000s).\nBy 2010, raves were becoming the equivalent of large-scale rock music festivals, but many times even bigger and more profitable. The Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas drew more than 300,000 fans over three days in the summer of 2012, making it the largest EDM music festival in North America. Ultra Music Festival in Miami drew 150,000 fans over three days in 2012 while other raves like Electric Zoo in New York, Beyond Wonderland in LA, Movement in Detroit, Electric Forest in Michigan, Spring Awakening Music Festival in Chicago, and dozens more now attract hundreds of thousands of \"ravers\" every year. These new EDM-based rave events (now simply referred generically to as \"music festivals\") sell out. Festival attendance at the Electric Daisy Carnival (EDC) increased by 39.1%, or 90,000 attendees from 2011 to 2012. In 2013, EDC had attendance of approximately 345,000 people, a record for the festival. The average ticket for EDC cost over $300 and the event contributed $278\u00a0million to the Clark County economy in 2013. This festival takes place at a 1,000-acre complex featuring a half dozen custom built stages, enormous interactive art installations, and hundreds of EDM artists. Insomniac, a US EDM event promoter, holds yearly EDC and other EDM events.\nAustralia.\n1980s and 1990s: outdoor raves and the Sydney scene.\nRave parties began in Australia as early as the 1980s and continued well into the late 1990s. They were mobilised versions of the 'warehouse parties', across Britain. Similar to the United States and Britain, raves in Australia were unlicensed and held in spaces normally used for industrial and manufacturing purposes, such as warehouses, factories and carpet showrooms. In addition, suburban locations were also used: basketball gymnasiums, train stations and even circus tents were all common venues. In Sydney, common areas used for outdoor events included Sydney Park, a reclaimed garbage dump in the inner south west of the city, Cataract Park and various other natural, unused locations and bush lands. The raves placed a heavy emphasis on the connection between humans and the natural environment, thus many raves in Sydney were held outdoors, notably the 'Happy Valley' parties (1991\u20131994), 'Ecology' (1992) and 'Field of Dreams 4' (6 July 1996). The mid-late 1990s saw a slight decline in rave attendance, attributed to the death of Anna Wood at a licensed inner-city Sydney venue, which was hosting a rave party known as \"Apache\". Wood had taken ecstasy and died in hospital a few days later, leading to extensive media exposure on the correlation of drug culture and its links to the rave scene in Australia.\n2000s\u2013present.\nThe tradition continued in Melbourne, with 'Earthcore' parties. Raves also became less underground as they were in the 1990s, and many were held at licensed venues well into the 2000s. Despite this, rave parties of 1990s size became less common. Nonetheless, the rave scene in Australia experienced a resurgence during the 2010s. During this period the resurfacing of the \"Melbourne Shuffle\", a Melbourne club/rave dance style, became a YouTube trend and videos were uploaded. The rave subculture in Melbourne was strengthened with the opening of clubs such as Bass Station and Hard Candy and the rise of free party groups such as Melbourne Underground. In Melbourne, warehouse squat party and outdoor raves were frequently held throughout the 2010s, with attendance occasionally entering the thousands.\nChina.\nUnderground raves and rave subcultures exist within Chinese cities such as Shanghai and Shenzhen, although the government has cracked down on clubs in the past as part of anti-drug campaigns.\nNotable events.\nThe following is an incomplete list of notable raves.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotable soundsystems.\nThe following is an incomplete list of notable sound systems:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Regarded as an icon of Dutch culture, there are approximately 1,000 windmills in the Netherlands today.\nForerunners.\nWind-powered machines have been known earlier, the Babylonian emperor Hammurabi had used wind mill power for his irrigation project in Mesopotamia in the 17th century BC.\nLater, Hero of Alexandria (Heron) in first-century Roman Egypt described what appears to be a wind-driven wheel to power a machine. His description of a wind-powered organ is not a practical windmill but was either an early wind-powered toy or a design concept for a wind-powered machine that may or may not have been a working device, as there is ambiguity in the text and issues with the design. Another early example of a wind-driven wheel was the prayer wheel, which is believed to have been first used in Tibet and China, though there is uncertainty over the date of its first appearance, which could have been either c.\u2009400, the 7th century, or after the 9th century.\nOne of the earliest recorded working windmill designs found was invented sometime around 700\u2013900 AD in Persia. This design was the panemone, with vertical lightweight wooden sails attached by horizontal struts to a central vertical shaft. It was first built to pump water and subsequently modified to grind grain as well.\nHorizontal windmills.\nThe first practical windmills were panemone windmills, using sails that rotated in a horizontal plane, around a vertical axis. Made of six to 12 sails covered in reed matting or cloth material, these windmills were used to grind grain or draw up water. A medieval account reports that windmill technology was used in Persia and the Middle East during the reign of Rashidun caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab (r.\u2009634\u00a0\u2013\u00a0644), based on the caliph's conversation with a Persian builder slave. The authenticity of part of the anecdote involving the caliph Umar is questioned because it was recorded only in the 10th century. The Persian geographer Estakhri reported windmills being operated in Khorasan (Eastern Iran and Western Afghanistan) already in the 9th century.\nSuch windmills were in widespread use across the Middle East and Central Asia and later spread to Europe, China, and India from there. By the 11th century, the vertical-axle windmill had reached parts of Southern Europe, including the Iberian Peninsula (via Al-Andalus) and the Aegean Sea (in the Balkans). A similar type of horizontal windmill with rectangular blades, used for irrigation, can also be found in thirteenth-century China (during the Jurchen Jin dynasty in the north), introduced by the travels of Yel\u00fc Chucai to Turkestan in 1219.\nVertical-axle windmills were built, in small numbers, in Europe during the 18th and nineteenth centuries, for example Fowler's Mill at Battersea in London, and Hooper's Mill at Margate in Kent. These early modern examples seem not to have been directly influenced by the vertical-axle windmills of the medieval period, but to have been independent inventions by 18th-century engineers.\nVertical windmills.\nThe horizontal-axis or vertical windmill (so called due to the plane of the movement of its sails) is a development of the 12th century, first used in northwestern Europe, in the triangle of northern France, eastern England and Flanders.\nIt is unclear whether the vertical windmill was influenced by the introduction of the horizontal windmill from Persia-Middle East to Southern Europe in the preceding century.\nThe earliest certain reference to a windmill in Northern Europe (assumed to have been of the vertical type) dates from 1185, in the former village of Weedley in Yorkshire which was located at the southern tip of the Wold overlooking the Humber Estuary. Several earlier, but less certainly dated, 12th-century European sources referring to windmills have also been found.\nThese earliest mills were used to grind cereals.\nPost mill.\nThe evidence at present is that the earliest type of European windmill was the post mill, so named because of the large upright post on which the mill's main structure (the \"body\" or \"buck\") is balanced. By mounting the body this way, the mill can rotate to face the wind direction; an essential requirement for windmills to operate economically in north-western Europe, where wind directions are variable. The body contains all the milling machinery. The first post mills were of the sunken type, where the post was buried in an earth mound to support it. Later, a wooden support was developed called the trestle. This was often covered over or surrounded by a roundhouse to protect the trestle from the weather and to provide storage space. This type of windmill was the most common in Europe until the 19th century when more powerful tower and smock mills replaced them.\nHollow-post mill.\nIn a hollow-post mill, the post on which the body is mounted is hollowed out, to accommodate the drive shaft.\nThis makes it possible to drive machinery below or outside the body while still being able to rotate the body into the wind. Hollow-post mills driving scoop wheels were used in the Netherlands to drain wetlands since the early 15th century onwards.\nTower mill.\nBy the end of the 13th century, the masonry tower mill, on which only the cap is rotated rather than the whole body of the mill, had been introduced. The spread of tower mills came with a growing economy that called for larger and more stable sources of power, though they were more expensive to build. In contrast to the post mill, only the cap of the tower mill needs to be turned into the wind, so the main structure can be made much taller, allowing the sails to be made longer, which enables them to provide useful work even in low winds. The cap can be turned into the wind either by winches or gearing inside the cap or from a winch on the tail pole outside the mill. A method of keeping the cap and sails into the wind automatically is by using a fantail, a small windmill mounted at right angles to the sails, at the rear of the windmill. These are also fitted to tail poles of post mills and are common in Great Britain and English-speaking countries of the former British Empire, Denmark, and Germany but rare in other places. Around some parts of the Mediterranean Sea, tower mills with fixed caps were built because the wind's direction varied little most of the time.\nSmock mill.\nThe smock mill is a later development of the tower mill, where the masonry tower is replaced by a wooden framework, called the \"smock\", which is thatched, boarded, or covered by other materials, such as slate, sheet metal, or tar paper. The smock is commonly of octagonal plan, though there are examples with different numbers of sides.\nSmock windmills were introduced by the Dutch in the 17th century to overcome the limitations of tower windmills, which were expensive to build and could not be erected on wet surfaces. The lower half of the smock windmill was made of brick, while the upper half was made of wood, with a sloping tower shape that added structural strength to the design. This made them lightweight and able to be erected on unstable ground.\nThe smock windmill design included a small turbine in the back that helped the main mill to face the direction of the wind.\nMechanics.\nSails.\nCommon sails consist of a lattice framework on which the sailcloth is spread. The miller can adjust the amount of cloth spread according to the wind and the power needed. In medieval mills, the sailcloth was wound in and out of a ladder-type arrangement of sails. Later mill sails had a lattice framework over which the sailcloth was spread, while in colder climates, the cloth was replaced by wooden slats, which were easier to handle in freezing conditions. The jib sail is commonly found in Mediterranean countries and consists of a simple triangle of cloth wound round a spar.\nIn all cases, the mill needs to be stopped to adjust the sails. Inventions in Great Britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries led to sails that automatically adjust to the wind speed without the need for the miller to intervene, culminating in patent sails invented by William Cubitt in 1807. In these sails, the cloth is replaced by a mechanism of connected shutters.\nIn France, Pierre-Th\u00e9ophile Berton invented a system consisting of longitudinal wooden slats connected by a mechanism that lets the miller open them while the mill is turning. In the twentieth century, increased knowledge of aerodynamics from the development of the airplane led to further improvements in efficiency by German engineer Bilau and several Dutch millwrights.\nThe majority of windmills have four sails. Multiple-sailed mills, with five, six, or eight sails, were built in Great Britain (especially in and around the counties of Lincolnshire and Yorkshire), Germany, and less commonly elsewhere. Earlier multiple-sailed mills are found in Spain, Portugal, Greece, parts of Romania, Bulgaria, and Russia. A mill with an even number of sails has the advantage of being able to run with a damaged sail by removing both the damaged sail and the one opposite, which does not unbalance the mill.\nIn the Netherlands, the stationary position of the sails, i.e. when the mill is not working, has long been used to give signals. If the blades are stopped in a \"+\" sign (3-6-9-12 o'clock), the windmill is open for business. When the blades are stopped in an \"X\" configuration, the windmill is closed or not functional. A slight tilt of the sails (top blade at 1 o'clock) signals joy, such as the birth of a healthy baby. A tilt of the blades to 11-2-5-8 o'clock signals mourning, or warning. It was used to signal the local region during Nazi operations in World War II, such as searches for Jews. Across the Netherlands, windmills were placed in mourning positions in honor of the Dutch victims of the 2014 Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 shootdown.\nMachinery.\nGears inside a windmill convey power from the rotary motion of the sails to a mechanical device. The sails are carried on the horizontal windshaft. Windshafts can be wholly made of wood, wood with a cast iron pole end (where the sails are mounted), or entirely of cast iron. The brake wheel is fitted onto the windshaft between the front and rear bearings. It has the brake around the outside of the rim and teeth in the side of the rim which drives the horizontal gearwheel called wallower on the top end of the vertical upright shaft. In grist mills, the great spur wheel, lower down the upright shaft, drives one or more stone nuts on the shafts driving each millstone. Post mills sometimes have a head and/or tail wheel driving the stone nuts directly, instead of the spur gear arrangement. Additional gear wheels drive a sack hoist or other machinery.\nThe machinery differs if the windmill is used for other applications than milling grain. A drainage mill uses another set of gear wheels on the bottom end of the upright shaft to drive a scoop wheel or Archimedes' screw. Sawmills uses a crankshaft to provide a reciprocating motion to the saws. Windmills have been used to power many other industrial processes, including papermills, threshing mills, and to process oil seeds, wool, paints, and stone products.\nSpread and decline.\nIn the 14th century, windmills became popular in Europe; the total number of wind-powered mills is estimated to have been around 200,000 at the peak in 1850, which is close to half of the some 500,000 water wheels. Windmills were applied in regions where there was too little water, where rivers freeze in winter and in flat lands where the flow of the river was too slow to provide the required power. With the coming of the Industrial Revolution, the importance of wind and water as primary industrial energy sources declined, and they were eventually replaced by steam (in steam mills) and internal combustion engines, although windmills continued to be built in large numbers until late in the nineteenth century. More recently, windmills have been preserved for their historic value, in some cases as static exhibits when the antique machinery is too fragile to be put in motion, and other cases as fully working mills.\nOf the 10,000 windmills in use in the Netherlands around 1850, about 1,000 are still standing. Most of these are being run by volunteers, though some grist mills are still operating commercially. Many of the drainage mills have been appointed as a backup to the modern pumping stations. The Zaan district has been said to have been the first industrialized region of the world with around 600 operating wind-powered industries by the end of the eighteenth century. Economic fluctuations and the industrial revolution had a much greater impact on these industries than on grain and drainage mills, so only very few are left.\nConstruction of mills spread to the Cape Colony in the seventeenth century. The early tower mills did not survive the gales of the Cape Peninsula, so in 1717 the Heeren XVII sent carpenters, masons, and materials to construct a durable mill. The mill, completed in 1718, became known as the \"Oude Molen\" and was located between Pinelands Station and the Black River. Long since demolished, its name lives on as that of a Technical school in Pinelands. By 1863, Cape Town had 11 mills stretching from Paarden Eiland to Mowbray.\nModern windmills.\nWind turbines.\nA wind turbine is a windmill-like structure specifically developed to generate electricity. They can be seen as the next step in the development of the windmill. The first wind turbines were built by the end of the nineteenth century by James Blyth in Scotland (1887), Charles F. Brush in Cleveland, Ohio (1887\u20131888) and Poul la Cour in Denmark (1890s). La Cour's mill from 1896 later became the local power of the village of Askov. By 1908, there were 72 wind-driven electric generators in Denmark, ranging from 5 to 25\u00a0kW. By the 1930s, windmills were widely used to generate electricity on farms in the United States where distribution systems had not yet been installed, built by companies such as Jacobs Wind, Wincharger, Miller Airlite, Universal Aeroelectric, Paris-Dunn, Airline, and Winpower. The Dunlite Corporation produced turbines for similar locations in Australia.\nForerunners of modern horizontal-axis utility-scale wind generators were the WIME-3D in service in Balaklava, USSR, from 1931 until 1942, a 100\u00a0kW generator on a tower, the Smith\u2013Putnam wind turbine built in 1941 on the mountain known as Grandpa's Knob in Castleton, Vermont, United States, of 1.25 MW, and the NASA wind turbines developed from 1974 through the mid-1980s. The development of these 13 experimental wind turbines pioneered many of the wind turbine design technologies in use today, including steel tube towers, variable-speed generators, composite blade materials, and partial-span pitch control, as well as aerodynamic, structural, and acoustic engineering design capabilities. The modern wind power industry began in 1979 with the serial production of wind turbines by Danish manufacturers Kuriant, Vestas, Nordtank, and Bonus. These early turbines were small by today's standards, with capacities of 20\u201330\u00a0kW each. Since then, commercial turbines have increased greatly in size, with the Enercon E-126 capable of delivering up to 7 MW, while wind turbine production has expanded to many countries.\nAs the 21st century began, rising concerns over energy security, global warming, and eventual fossil fuel depletion led to an expansion of interest in all available forms of renewable energy. Worldwide, many thousands of wind turbines are now operating, with a total nameplate capacity of 591\u00a0GW as of 2018.\nMaterials.\nIn an attempt to make wind turbines more efficient and increase their energy output, they are being built bigger, with taller towers and longer blades, and being increasingly deployed in offshore locations. While such changes increase their power output, they subject the components of the windmills to stronger forces and consequently put them at a greater risk of failure. Taller towers and longer blades suffer from higher fatigue, and offshore windfarms are subject to greater forces due to higher wind speeds and accelerated corrosion due to the proximity to seawater.\nTo ensure a long enough lifetime to make the return on the investment viable, the materials for the components must be chosen appropriately.\nThe blade of a wind turbine consists of 4 main elements: the root, spar, aerodynamic fairing, and surfacing. The fairing is composed of two shells (one on the pressure side, and one on the suction side), connected by one or more webs linking the upper and lower shells. The webs connect to the spar laminates, which are enclosed within the skins (surfacing) of the blade, and together, the system of the webs and spars resist the flapwise loading. Flapwise loading, one of the two different types of loading that blades are subject to, is caused by the wind pressure, and edgewise loading (the second type of loading) is caused by the gravitational force and torque load. The former loading subjects the spar laminate on the pressure (upwind) side of the blade to cyclic tension-tension loading, while the suction (downwind) side of the blade is subject to cyclic compression-compression loading. Edgewise bending subjects the leading edge to a tensile load, and the trailing edge to a compressive load. The remainder of the shell, not supported by the spars or laminated at the leading and trailing edges, is designed as a sandwiched structure, consisting of multiple layers to prevent elastic buckling.\nIn addition to meeting the stiffness, strength, and toughness requirements determined by the loading, the blade needs to be lightweight, and the weight of the blade scales with the cube of its radius. To determine which materials fit the criteria described above, a parameter known as the beam merit index is defined: Mb = E^1/2 / rho, where E is Young's modulus and rho is the density. The best blade materials are carbon fiber and glass fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP and GFRP). Currently, GFRP materials are chosen for their lower cost, despite the much greater figure of merit of CFRP.\nRecycling and waste problems with polymers blades.\nWhen the Vindeby Offshore Wind Farm was taken down in Denmark in 2017, 99% of the not-degradable fiberglass from 33 wind turbine blades ended as cut up at the R\u00e6rup Controlled Landfill near Aalborg and in 2020, with considerably larger fiberglass quantities, even though it is the least environmentally friendly way of handling waste. Scrapped wind turbine blades are set to become a huge waste problem in Denmark and countries Denmark, to a greater and greater extent, export its many produced wind turbines.\n\"The reason why many wings end up in landfill is that they are incredibly difficult to separate from each other, which you will have to do if you hope to be able to recycle the fiberglass\", says Lykke Margot Ricard, Associate Professor in Innovation and Technological Foresight and education leader for civil engineering in Product Development and Innovation at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU). According to Dakofa, the Danish Competence Center for Waste and Resources, there is nothing specific in the Danish waste order about how to handle discarded fiberglass.\nSeveral scrap dealers tell Ingeni\u00f8ren that they have handled wind turbine blades (wings) that have been pulverized after being taken to a recycling station. One of them is the recycling company H.J. Hansen, where the product manager informed, that they have transported approximately half of the wings they have received since 2012 to Reno Nord's landfill in Aalborg. A total of around 1,000 wings have ended up there, he estimates - and today up to 99 percent of the wings the company receives end up in a landfill.\nSince 1996, according to an estimate made by Lykke Margot Ricard (SDU) in 2020, at least 8,810 tonnes of the wing scrap have been disposed of in Denmark, and the waste problem will grow significantly in the coming years when more and more wind turbines have reached their end of life. According to the SDU lecturer's calculations, the waste sector in Denmark will have to receive 46,400 tonnes of fiberglass from wind turbine blades over the next 20\u201325 years.\nAs so, at the island, Lolland, in Denmark, 250 tonnes of fiberglass from wind turbine waste also pours up on a landfill at Gerringe in the middle of Lolland in 2020.\nIn the United States, worn-out wind turbine blades made of fiberglass go to the handful of landfills that accept them (e.g., in Lake Mills, Iowa; Sioux Falls, South Dakota; Casper).\nWindpumps.\nWindpumps were used to pump water since at least the 9th century in what is now Afghanistan, Iran, and Pakistan. The use of windpumps became widespread across the Muslim world and later spread to East Asia (China) and South Asia (India). Windmills were later used extensively in Europe, particularly in the Netherlands and the East Anglia area of Great Britain, from the late Middle Ages onwards, to drain land for agricultural or building purposes.\nThe \"American windmill\", or \"wind engine\", was invented by Daniel Halladay in 1854 and was used mostly for lifting water from wells. Larger versions were also used for tasks such as sawing wood, chopping hay, and shelling and grinding grain. In early California and some other states, the windmill was part of a self-contained domestic water system which included a hand-dug well and a wooden water tower supporting a redwood tank enclosed by wooden siding known as a tankhouse. During the late 19th century, steel blades and towers replaced wooden construction. At their peak in 1930, an estimated 600,000 units were in use. Firms such as U.S. Wind Engine and Pump Company, Challenge Wind Mill and Feed Mill Company, Appleton Manufacturing Company, Star, Eclipse, Fairbanks-Morse, Dempster Mill Manufacturing Company, and Aermotor became the main suppliers in North and South America. These windpumps are used extensively on farms and ranches in the United States, Canada, Southern Africa, and Australia. They feature a large number of blades, so they turn slowly with considerable torque in low winds and are self-regulating in high winds. A tower-top gearbox and crankshaft convert the rotary motion into reciprocating strokes carried downward through a rod to the pump cylinder below. Such mills pumped water and powered feed mills, sawmills, and agricultural machinery.\nIn Australia, the Griffiths Brothers at Toowoomba manufactured windmills of the American pattern from 1876, with the trade name Southern Cross Windmills in use from 1903. These became an icon of the Australian rural sector by utilizing the water of the Great Artesian Basin. Another well-known maker was Metters Ltd. of Adelaide, Perth and Sydney.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the lead singer and lyricist of Kilburn and the High Roads, the Kilburns, Ian Dury and the Blockheads and Ian Dury and the Music Students.\nEarly life and education.\nIan Dury was born at 43 Weald Rise in Harrow, at that time in Middlesex. His early years were spent in Harrow Weald (although it is often misreported that he was born in Upminster, Essex, an impression he often encouraged) and in Mevagissey, Cornwall, during the Blitz. His father, William George Dury (born 23 September 1905 in Southborough, Kent, died 25 February 1968 in Victoria, London), was a former boxer, coach and bus driver, and chauffeur for Rolls-Royce. His mother, Margaret \"Peggy\" Cuthbertson Walker (born 17 April 1910, Rochdale, Lancashire, died 20 December 1994 in Hampstead, London), was a health visitor, a doctor's daughter and the granddaughter of an East Donegal Ulster Protestant landowner. Bill and Peggy married in 1939 and set up home in Belsize Park, London.\nBill Dury was absent for work for long periods, so Peggy often took Ian to stay with her parents in Mevagissey. After the Second World War, the family moved briefly to Switzerland, where Ian's father was chauffeuring for a millionaire and the Western European Union. In 1946, Peggy brought Ian back to England and they relocated to Cranham, near Upminster in Essex, to live with Peggy's sisters. Although he saw his father on visits, they were never to live together again.\nAt age seven, Dury contracted polio, most likely, he believed, at Westcliff Swimming Pool in Southend-on-Sea during the 1949 polio epidemic. After six weeks of isolation in the Royal Cornwall Infirmary, Truro, Ian was moved by ambulance back to Essex, to Black Notley Hospital in Braintree, where he spent eighteen months regaining his strength and mobility. Polio caused paralysis on the left-hand side of his body which led to a permanent disability.\nIan attended Chailey Heritage Craft School, East Sussex, from 1951 till 1954. Chailey was a hospital school for disabled children that had an ethos of toughening up its students, often by leaving the less physically able to find their own way up off the floor. Arguably, this harsh approach contributed to the tough and determined person Dury became. Chailey taught trades such as cobbling and printing, but Dury's mother wanted him to focus on academic studies, so Aunt Moll (Mary Walker), a Buckinghamshire Education Officer, arranged for him to attend the Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe. Ian found this school a challenge and recounted being punished for misdemeanours by being forced by prefects to learn long tracts of poetry until a housemaster found him sobbing and put a stop to it:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I had to go into a box room where the suitcases were stored and learn 80 lines of \"Ode to Autumn\" by yer man Keats. If I got a word wrong I had to go back, they added that to the end of the sentence and after five nights of this my head had definitely gone. He left school at 16, having achieved GCE 'O' levels in English Language, English Literature and Art to study art and design at Walthamstow College of Art, where he met lifelong friend, pop artist and teacher Peter Blake. In 1963 Ian began an MA in painting at the Royal College of Art, graduating in 1966.\nArt career.\nIn 1967 Dury took part in a group exhibition, \"Fantasy and Figuration\", alongside Elizabeth Rathmell, Pat Douthwaite, Herbert Kitchen and Stass Paraskos at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London.\nBetween 1966 and 1973 he was an art teacher at Luton College of Technology and at Canterbury College of Art. He also painted commercial illustrations for \"The Sunday Times\" in the early 1970s.\nMusic career.\nKilburn and the High Roads (1971\u20131975).\nDury formed Kilburn and the High Roads (a reference to the road in North West London) in 1971, and they played their first gig at Croydon School of Art on 5 December 1971. Dury was vocalist and lyricist, co-writing with pianist Russell Hardy and later enrolling into the group a number of the students he was teaching at Canterbury College of Art and Medway College of Design (now the University for the Creative Arts), including bassist Humphrey Ocean.\nManaged first by Charlie Gillett and Gordon Nelki and latterly by fashion entrepreneur Tommy Roberts, the Kilburns were popular on London's pub rock circuit and signed to Dawn Records in 1974 but, despite favourable press coverage and a tour opening for English rock band The Who, the group failed to rise above cult status and disbanded in 1975.\nKilburn and the High Roads recorded two albums, \"Handsome\" and \"Wotabunch!\".\nGoing solo (August \u2013 September 1977).\nThe single \"Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll\", released 26 August 1977, marked Dury's Stiff Records debut. Although it was banned by the BBC, it was named Single of the Week by \"NME\" on its release. The single issue was soon followed, at the end of September, by the album \"New Boots and Panties!!\" which achieved platinum status. \"Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll\" was not listed on the album's track list, yet it was nonetheless present as track 1 on side 2 of some later 1977 pressings).\nThe Blockheads.\nUnder the management of Andrew King and Peter Jenner, the original managers of Pink Floyd, Ian Dury and the Blockheads quickly gained a reputation as one of the top live acts of new wave music.\nThe Blockheads' sound drew from its members' diverse musical influences, which included jazz, rock and roll, funk, and reggae, and Dury's love of music hall. The band was formed after Dury began writing songs with pianist and guitarist Chaz Jankel (the brother of music video, TV, commercial and film director Annabel Jankel). Jankel took Dury's lyrics, fashioned a number of songs, and they began recording with members of Radio Caroline's Loving Awareness Band\u00a0\u2013 drummer Charley Charles (born Hugh Glenn Mortimer Charles, Guyana 1945), bassist Norman Watt-Roy, keyboard player Mick Gallagher, guitarist John Turnbull and former Kilburns saxophonist Davey Payne.\nIn October 1977 Dury and his band started performing as Ian Dury and the Blockheads, when the band signed on for the Stiff \"Live Stiffs Tour\" alongside Elvis Costello &amp; the Attractions, Nick Lowe, Wreckless Eric, and Larry Wallis. The tour was a success, and Stiff launched a concerted Ian Dury marketing campaign, resulting in the Top Ten hit \"What a Waste\" and the hit single \"Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick\", which reached No.\u00a01 in the UK at the beginning of 1979, selling just short of a million copies. Again, \"Hit Me\" was not included on the original release of the subsequent album \"Do It Yourself\". With their hit singles, the band built up a dedicated following in the UK and other countries and their next single \"Reasons to be Cheerful, Part 3\" made number three in the UK.\nThe band's second album \"Do It Yourself\" was released in June 1979 in a Barney Bubbles-designed sleeve of which there were over a dozen variations, all based on samples from the Crown wallpaper catalogue. Bubbles also designed the Blockhead logo.\nJankel left the band temporarily and relocated to the US after the release of \"What a Waste\" (his organ part on that single was overdubbed later) but he subsequently returned to the UK and began touring sporadically with the Blockheads, eventually returning to the group full-time for the recording of \"Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick\"; according to Mickey Gallagher, the band recorded 28 takes of the song but eventually settled on the second take for the single release. Partly due to personality clashes with Dury, Jankel left the group again in 1980, after the recording of the \"Do It Yourself\" LP, and he returned to the US to concentrate on his solo career.\nThe group worked solidly over the 18 months between the release of \"Rhythm Stick\" and their next single, \"Reasons to Be Cheerful, Part 3\", which returned them to the charts, making the UK Top 10. Jankel was replaced by former Dr. Feelgood guitarist Wilko Johnson, who also contributed to the next album \"Laughter\" (1980) and its two hit singles, although Gallagher recalls that the recording of the \"Laughter\" album was difficult and that Dury was drinking heavily in this period.\nIn 1980\u201381 Dury and Jankel teamed up again with Sly and Robbie and the Compass Point All Stars to record \"Lord Upminster\" (1981). The Blockheads toured the UK and Europe throughout 1981, sometimes augmented by jazz trumpeter Don Cherry, ending the year with their only tour of Australia.\nThe Blockheads disbanded in early 1982, after Dury secured a new recording deal with Polydor Records through A&amp;R man Frank Neilson. Choosing to work with a group of young musicians which he named the Music Students, he recorded the album \"Four Thousand Weeks' Holiday\". This album marked a departure from his usual style and was not as well received by fans for its American jazz influence.\nThe Blockheads briefly reformed in June 1987 to play a short tour of Japan, and then disbanded again. In September 1990, following the death from cancer of drummer Charley Charles, they reunited for two benefit concerts in aid of Charles' family, held at The Forum, Camden Town, with Steven Monti on drums. In December 1990, augmented by Merlin Rhys-Jones on guitar and Will Parnell on percussion, they recorded the live album \"Warts &amp; Audience\" at the Brixton Academy.\nThe Blockheads (minus Jankel, who returned to California) toured Spain in January 1991, then disbanded again until August 1992 when, following Jankel's return to England, they were invited to reform for the Madstock! Festival in Finsbury Park; this was followed by sporadic gigs in Europe, Ireland, the UK and Japan in late 1994 and 1995. In the early 1990s, Dury appeared with English band Curve on the benefit compilation album \"Peace Together\". Dury and Curve singer Toni Halliday shared vocals on a cover of the Blockheads' track \"What a Waste\".\nIn March 1996 Dury was diagnosed with cancer and, after recovering from an operation, he set about writing another album. In late 1996 he reunited with the Blockheads to record the album \"Mr. Love Pants\" (1998). Ian Dury and the Blockheads resumed touring, with Dylan Howe replacing Steven Monti on drums. Davey Payne left the group permanently in August and was replaced by Gilad Atzmon; this line-up gigged throughout 1999, culminating in their last performance with Ian Dury on 6 February 2000 at the London Palladium. Dury died six weeks later on 27 March 2000.\nThe Blockheads have continued after Dury's death, and continue to play live gigs as of 2023[ [update]].\nOther solo work.\nDury continued to record other work without the Blockheads, including \"Lord Upminster\" (1981); \"Apples\" (1989) and \"The Bus Driver's Prayer &amp; Other Stories\" (1992). He also released a single album with the Music Students, \"4,000 Weeks' Holiday\" (1984).\nHis 1981 song \"Spasticus Autisticus\"\u00a0\u2013 written to show his disdain for that year's International Year of Disabled Persons, which he saw as patronising and counter-productive\u00a0\u2013 was banned by the BBC from being broadcast by the BBC before 6 pm. The lyrics were uncompromising:\n&lt;poem&gt;\n So place your hard-earned peanuts in my tin\n And thank the Creator you're not in the state I'm in\n So long have I been languished on the shelf\n I must give all proceedings to myself&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe song's refrain, \"I'm spasticus, autisticus\", was inspired by the response of the rebellious Roman gladiators in the film \"Spartacus\", who, when instructed to identify their leader, all answered, \"I am Spartacus\", to protect him. According to George McKay, in his 2009 article \"Crippled with nerves\" (an early Dury song title), for \"Popular Music\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Ian Dury, that 'flaw of the jungle', produced a remarkable and sustained body of work that explored issues of disability, in both personal and social contexts, institutionalisation, and to a lesser extent the pop cultural tradition of disability. He also, with the single \"Spasticus Autisticus\" (1981), produced one of the outstanding protest songs about the place of disabled people in what he called 'normal land'.\nDury described the song as \"a war cry\" on \"Desert Island Discs\". The song was used at the opening of the London 2012 Paralympics.\nIn 1984, Dury was featured in the music video for the minor hit single \"Walking in My Sleep\" by Roger Daltrey of The Who.\nMusical influences and style.\nDury's self-styling and chief musical influence was his hero since childhood, American rock and roll and rockabilly artist Gene Vincent. After hearing Vincent's hit single \"Be-Bop-a-Lula\" in the 1956 musical comedy film \"The Girl Can't Help It\", he idolised him. Vincent also wore a leg brace, although Dury said he did not know this until later. Vincent is mentioned in one of Dury's earliest songs, \"Upminster Kid\" (on the 1975 Kilburn and the High Roads album \"Handsome\"), with the words \"Well Gene Vincent Craddock remembered the love of an Upminster rock 'n' roll teen\". Vincent had died four years earlier.\nMore well-known is the single \"Sweet Gene Vincent\" from his first solo album, \"New Boots and Panties!!\" in 1977. He wrote the lyrics after spending six weeks of research on Vincent, which included reading two biographies. His songwriting partner Chas Jankel had to trim it considerably, after Dury's original version, Jankel joked, \"would have taken around 15 minutes to perform\". The opening lyrics to the song were:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Blue Gene baby / Skinny white sailor, the chances were slender / The beauties were brief / Shall I mourn your decline with some Thunderbird wine / And a black handkerchief? / I miss your sad Virginia whisper / I miss the voice that called my heart.\nDury was a lover of music hall, another of his heroes being Max Wall. Dury developed a unique style that mixed music hall with punk and rock and roll, and crafted an on-stage persona that entertained his audiences.\nDury's lyrics are a combination of lyrical poetry, word play, observation of British everyday life, character sketches, and sexual humour: \"This is what we find\u00a0... Home improvement expert Harold Hill of Harold Hill, Of do-it-yourself dexterity and double-glazing skill, Came home to find another gentleman's kippers in the grill, So he sanded off his winkle with his Black &amp; Decker drill\". The song \"Billericay Dickie\" rhymes \"I had a love affair with Nina, In the back of my Cortina\" with \"A seasoned-up hyena Could not have been more obscener\".\nActing and other activities.\nDury's confident and unusual demeanour caught the eyes of producers and directors of drama. His first important and extensive role was in Farrukh Dhondy's mini-series for the BBC \"King of the Ghetto\" (1986), a drama set in London's multi-racial Brick Lane area with a cast led by a young Tim Roth.\nDury had small parts in several films, probably the best known of which was Peter Greenaway's \"The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover\" (1989), as well as a cameo appearance in Roman Polanski's \"Pirates\" (1986). He also appeared in the Eduardo Guedes film \" Rocinante\" (1986), the German comedy (lead) \"Brennende Betten\" (Burning Beds) (1988), Alejandro Jodorowsky's \"The Rainbow Thief\" (1990), and the Sylvester Stallone science fiction film \"Judge Dredd\" (1995). His other film appearances included roles in \"Number One\" (1985) starring Bob Geldof, the Bob Hoskins film \"The Raggedy Rawney\" (1988), and \"Split Second\" (1992) starring Rutger Hauer and Kim Cattrall. He also appeared alongside fellow lyricists Bob Dylan and Tom Waits, respectively, in the movies \"Hearts of Fire\" (1987) and \"Bearskin: An Urban Fairytale\" (1990), also by Eduardo Guedes. His later films included the comedy \"Different for Girls\" (1996), and \"\" (1996), directed by Tim Pope, who had directed a few of Dury's music videos.\nDury also wrote a musical, \"Apples\", staged in London's Royal Court Theatre. In 1987 he appeared as the narrator (Scullery) in \"Road\", also at the Royal Court. Among the cast was actress and singer Jane Horrocks, who cohabited with Dury until late in 1988, although the relationship was kept discreet.\nDury wrote and performed the theme song \"Profoundly in Love with Pandora\" for the television series \"The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13\u00be\" (1985), based on the book of the same name by Sue Townsend, as well as its follow-up, \"The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole\" (1987). Dury turned down an offer from Andrew Lloyd Webber to write the libretto for \"Cats\" (from which Richard Stilgoe reportedly earned millions). The reason, said Dury, \"I can't stand his music.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...\u00a0I said no straight off. I hate Andrew Lloyd Webber. He's a wanker, isn't he?\u00a0... [E]very time I hear 'Don't Cry for Me Argentina' I feel sick, it's so bad. He got Richard Stilgoe to do the lyrics in the end, who's not as good as me. He made millions out of it. He's crap, but he did ask the top man first!\nWhen HIV/AIDS first came to prominence in the mid-1980s, Dury was among celebrities who appeared on UK television to promote safe sex, demonstrating how to put on a condom using a model of an erect penis. In the 1990s, he became an ambassador for UNICEF, recruiting stars such as Robbie Williams to publicise the cause. The two visited Sri Lanka in this capacity to promote polio vaccination. Dury appeared with Curve on the \"Peace Together\" concert and CD (1993), performing \"What a Waste\", with benefits to the Youth of Northern Ireland. He also supported the charity Cancer BACUP.\nDury appeared in the \"Classic Albums\" episode that focused on Steely Dan's album \"Aja\". Dury commented that the album was one of the most \"upful\" he had ever heard, and that the album \"lifted [his] spirits up\" whenever he played it.\nDury also appeared at the end of the Carter USM track \"Skywest &amp; Crooked\" narrating from the musical \"Man of La Mancha\".\nIllness and death.\nDury was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 1996 and underwent surgery, but tumours were later found in his liver, and he was told that his condition was terminal.\nIn 1998, his death was incorrectly announced on XFM radio by Bob Geldof, possibly due to hoax information from a listener. In 1999, Dury collaborated with Madness on their first original album in fourteen years on the track \"Drip Fed Fred\". It was one of his last recordings, though he also performed again with the Blockheads in mid-1999 at Ronnie Scott's in Soho. This was a special performance recorded for LWT's \"South Bank Show\" and the audience were invited fans and friends of the band and crew. His deteriorating condition was evident and he had to take rests between takes and be helped on and off stage.\nIan Dury and the Blockheads' last public performance was a charity concert in aid of Cancer BACUP on 6 February 2000 at the London Palladium, supported by Kirsty MacColl and Phill Jupitus. Dury was noticeably ill and again had to be helped on and off stage.\nDury died of metastatic colorectal cancer on 27 March 2000, aged 57, in Hampstead, London. He was cremated after a humanist funeral at Golders Green Crematorium with 250 mourners at the service, including fellow musicians Suggs and Jools Holland as well as Member of Parliament Mo Mowlam.\nAn obituary in \"The Guardian\" called him \"one of few true originals of the English music scene\". Suggs, the lead singer of Madness, called him \"possibly the finest lyricist we've seen\". The Ian Dury website opened an online book of condolence shortly after his death, which was signed by hundreds of fans.\nLegacy.\nDury's son, Baxter Dury, is also a singer. He sang a few of his father's songs at the wake after the funeral, and has released six of his own albums, including \"It's a Pleasure\" (2014), \"Prince of Tears\" (2017) and \"The Night Chancers\" (2020).\nIn 2002, Jemima Dury organised a \"musical bench\" designed by Mil Stricevic to be placed in a favourite viewing spot of Dury's near Poets' Corner, in the gardens of Pembroke Lodge, in Richmond Park, south-west London. The back of the bench is inscribed with the words \"Reasons to Be Cheerful\", the title of one of Dury's songs. The QR codes on the arms of the bench allow visitors to listen to a track listing of his songs on one side and his appearance on Desert Island Discs on the other.\nIn 1999 the autobiographical documentary \"On My Life\", directed by Mike Connolly, was released. The film, in which Dury recalls his life and career, intercut with concert footage, includes contributions from painter Peter Blake, Jemima and Baxter Dury, and members of the Blockheads. The programme was first broadcast in 1999, then again in August 2009 and March 2025 on BBC Four.\nBetween 6 January and 14 February 2009 a musical about his life, entitled \"Hit Me! The Life &amp; Rhymes of Ian Dury\", was premiered and ran at the Leicester Square Theatre in London.\nA biopic titled \"Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll\" starring Andy Serkis as Dury was released on 8 January 2010, and was nominated for several awards. Ray Winstone and Naomie Harris also appeared. The title of the film is derived from Dury's 1977 7\" single \"Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll\". Also in 2010 music journalist Will Birch published \"Ian Dury: The Definitive Biography\" which was well received.\nA musical, \"Reasons to be Cheerful\", was produced by the Graeae Theatre Company in association with Theatre Royal Stratford East and New Wolsey Theatre. Set in 1979 the musical featured Dury classics in a \"riotous coming-of-age tale\". The 2010 production was supported by the Blockheads, while Sir Peter Blake donated a limited edition print of the \"Reasons to be Cheerful\" artwork.\nInterviewed by the \"Evening Standard\" in 2010, son Baxter said his father \"was like a \"Polaris missile\"... \"He would seek out someone's weakness in seconds, and then lock onto it. That's how he controlled his environment. It was very funny, in a gruesome kind of way ... if it wasn't you he was picking on. But it was a strange obsession, too. Like, why do you want to be like that? He was never really physically violent\u00a0\u2013 he was a small disabled guy\u00a0\u2013 but there was a lot of mental violence.\"\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 2 in February 2021, English pop star Robbie Williams cited Dury as his biggest inspiration as a lyricist. Williams sings on the final track of the posthumously released album \"Ten More Turnips from the Tip\".\nPersonal life.\nDury married Elizabeth \"Betty\" Rathmell on 3 June 1967 in Barnstaple, Devon, and they had two children, Jemima and Baxter, in 1969 and 1971, respectively. In 1973 Dury left the family, who were living at the time in a Buckinghamshire village, and moved back to London to pursue his music career.\nHe lived with his partner Denise Roudette for six years after he moved back to London, renting 40 Oval Mansions in Kennington, which \"The Guardian\" referred to as \"one of London's most notorious squatted buildings\" and Dury himself dubbed \"Catshit Mansions\".\nDury and Rathmell divorced in 1985 but remained close. Starting in 1986 he had a year-long relationship with actor Jane Horrocks, whom he met while they both performed in Jim Cartright's play \"Road\" and they remained friends until his death.\nDury married sculptor Sophy Tilson in 1998, with whom he had two children Bill and Albert. Both have musical projects based in London \u2014 Rifle and Bill Dury and the Healers.\nDiscography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nStudio albums\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "43494", "revid": "275202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43494", "title": "Fairy tale", "text": "Fictional story typically featuring folkloric fantasy characters and magic\nA fairy tale (alternative names include fairytale, fairy story, household tale, magic tale, or wonder tale) is a short story that belongs to the folklore genre. Such stories typically feature magic, enchantments, and mythical or fanciful beings. In most cultures, there is no clear line separating myth from folk or fairy tale; all these together form the literature of preliterate societies. Fairy tales may be distinguished from other folk narratives such as legends (which generally involve belief in the veracity of the events described) and explicit moral tales, including beast fables. Prevalent elements include dragons, dwarfs, elves, fairies, giants, gnomes, goblins, griffins, merfolk, monsters, monarchy, pixies, talking animals, trolls, unicorns, witches, wizards, woodwoses, magic, and enchantments.\nIn less technical contexts, the term is also used to describe something blessed with unusual happiness, as in \"fairy-tale ending\" (a happy ending) or \"fairy-tale romance\". Colloquially, the term \"fairy tale\" or \"fairy story\" can also mean any far-fetched story or tall tale; it is used especially to describe any story that not only is not true, but also could not possibly be true. Legends are perceived as real within their culture; fairy tales may merge into legends, where the narrative is perceived both by teller and hearers as being grounded in historical truth. However, unlike legends and epics, fairy tales usually do not contain more than superficial references to religion and to actual places, people, and events; they take place \"once upon a time\" rather than in actual times.\nFairy tales occur both in oral and in literary form (literary fairy tale); the name \"fairy tale\" (\"\" in French) was first ascribed to them by Madame d'Aulnoy in the late 17th century. Many of today's fairy tales have evolved from centuries-old stories that have appeared, with variations, in multiple cultures around the world.\nThe history of the fairy tale is particularly difficult to trace because often only the literary forms survive. Still, according to researchers at universities in Durham and Lisbon, such stories may date back thousands of years, some to the Bronze Age. Fairy tales, and works derived from fairy tales, are still written today.\nFolklorists have classified fairy tales in various ways. The Aarne\u2013Thompson\u2013Uther Index and the morphological analysis of Vladimir Propp are among the most notable. Other folklorists have interpreted the tales' significance, but no school has been definitively established for the meaning of the tales.\nTerminology.\nSome folklorists prefer to use the German term or \"wonder tale\" to refer to the genre rather than \"fairy tale\", a practice given weight by the definition of Thompson in his 1977 [1946] edition of \"The Folktale\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"...a tale of some length involving a succession of motifs or episodes. It moves in an unreal world without definite locality or definite creatures and is filled with the marvellous. In this never-never land, humble heroes kill adversaries, succeed to kingdoms and marry princesses.\"\nThe characters and motifs of fairy tales are simple and archetypal: princesses and goose-girls; youngest sons and gallant princes; ogres, giants, dragons, and trolls; wicked stepmothers and false heroes; fairy godmothers and other magical helpers, often talking horses, or foxes, or birds; glass mountains; and prohibitions and breaking of prohibitions.\nDefinition.\nAlthough the fairy tale is a distinct genre within the larger category of folktale, the definition that marks a work as a fairy tale is a source of considerable dispute. The term itself comes from the translation of Madame D'Aulnoy's \"Conte de f\u00e9es\", first used in her collection in 1697. Common parlance conflates fairy tales with beast fables and other folktales, and scholars differ on the degree to which the presence of fairies and/or similarly mythical beings (e.g., elves, goblins, trolls, giants, huge monsters, or mermaids) should be taken as a differentiator. Vladimir Propp, in his \"Morphology of the Folktale\", criticized the common distinction between \"fairy tales\" and \"animal tales\" on the grounds that many tales contained both fantastic elements and animals. Nevertheless, to select works for his analysis, Propp used all Russian folktales classified as a folklore, Aarne\u2013Thompson\u2013Uther Index 300\u2013749,\u2014in a cataloguing system that made such a distinction\u2014to gain a clear set of tales. His own analysis identified fairy tales by their plot elements, but that in itself has been criticized, as the analysis does not lend itself easily to tales that do not involve a quest, and furthermore, the same plot elements are found in non-fairy tale works.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Were I asked, what is a fairytale? I should reply, Read Undine: that is a fairytale... of all fairytales I know, I think Undine the most beautiful.\u2014\u200a\nAs Stith Thompson points out, talking animals and the presence of magic seem to be more common to the fairy tale than fairies themselves. However, the mere presence of animals that talk does not make a tale a fairy tale, especially when the animal is clearly a mask on a human face, as in fables.\nIn his essay \"On Fairy-Stories\", J.R.R.Tolkien agreed with the exclusion of \"fairies\" from the definition, defining fairy tales as stories about the adventures of men in \"Fa\u00ebrie\", the land of fairies, fairytale princes and princesses, dwarves, elves, and not only other magical species but many other marvels. However, the same essay excludes tales that are often considered fairy tales, citing as an example \"The Monkey's Heart\", which Andrew Lang included in \"The Lilac Fairy Book\".\nSteven Swann Jones identified the presence of magic as the feature by which fairy tales can be distinguished from other sorts of folktales. Davidson and Chaudri identify \"transformation\" as the key feature of the genre. From a psychological point of view, Jean Chiriac argued for the necessity of the fantastic in these narratives.\nIn terms of aesthetic values, Italo Calvino cited the fairy tale as a prime example of \"quickness\" in literature, because of the economy and concision of the tales.\nHistory of the genre.\nOriginally, stories that would contemporarily be considered fairy tales were not marked out as a separate genre. The German term \" stems from the old German word \", which means news or tale. The word \" is the diminutive of the word \", therefore it means a \"little story\". Together with the common beginning \"once upon a time\", this tells us that a fairy tale or a m\u00e4rchen was originally a little story from a long time ago when the world was still magic. (Indeed, one less regular German opening is \"In the old times when wishing was still effective\".)\nThe French writers and adaptors of the \"conte\" \"de f\u00e9es\" genre often included fairies in their stories; the genre name became \"fairy tale\" in English translation and \"gradually eclipsed the more general term \"folk\" tale that covered a wide variety of oral tales\". Jack Zipes also attributes this shift to changing sociopolitical conditions in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries that led to the trivialization of these stories by the upper classes.\nRoots of the genre come from different oral stories passed down in European cultures. The genre was first marked out by writers of the Renaissance, such as Giovanni Francesco Straparola and Giambattista Basile, and stabilized through the works of later collectors such as Charles Perrault and the Brothers Grimm. In this evolution, the name was coined when the \"pr\u00e9cieuses\" took up writing literary stories; Madame d'Aulnoy invented the term \"Conte de f\u00e9e\", or fairy tale, in the late 17th century.\nBefore the definition of the genre of fantasy, many works that would now be classified as fantasy were termed \"fairy tales\", including Tolkien's \"The Hobbit\", George Orwell's \"Animal Farm\", and L. Frank Baum's \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\". Indeed, Tolkien's \"On Fairy-Stories\" includes discussions of world-building and is considered a vital part of fantasy criticism. Although fantasy, particularly the subgenre of fairytale fantasy, draws heavily on fairy tale motifs, the genres are now regarded as distinct.\nFolk and literary.\nThe fairy tale, told orally, is a sub-class of the folktale. Many writers have written in the form of the fairy tale. These are the literary fairy tales, or . The oldest forms, from \"Panchatantra\" to the \"Pentamerone\", show considerable reworking from the oral form. The Grimm brothers were among the first to try to preserve the features of oral tales. Yet the stories printed under the Grimm name have been considerably reworked to fit the written form.\nLiterary fairy tales and oral fairy tales freely exchanged plots, motifs, and elements with one another and with the tales of foreign lands. The literary fairy tale came into fashion during the 17th century, developed by aristocratic women as a parlour game. This, in turn, helped to maintain the oral tradition. According to Jack Zipes, \"The subject matter of the conversations consisted of literature, mores, taste, and etiquette, whereby the speakers all endeavoured to portray ideal situations in the most effective oratorical style that would gradually have a major effect on literary forms.\" Many 18th-century folklorists attempted to recover the \"pure\" folktale, uncontaminated by literary versions. Yet while oral fairy tales likely existed for thousands of years before the literary forms, there is no pure folktale, and each literary fairy tale draws on folk traditions, if only in parody. This makes it impossible to trace forms of transmission of a fairy tale. Oral story-tellers have been known to read literary fairy tales to increase their own stock of stories and treatments.\nHistory.\nThe oral tradition of the fairy tale came long before the written page. Tales were told or enacted dramatically, rather than written down, and handed down from generation to generation. Because of this, the history of their development is necessarily obscure and blurred. Fairy tales appear, now and again, in written literature throughout literate cultures, as in \"The Golden Ass\", which includes \"Cupid and Psyche\" (Roman, 100\u2013200 AD), or the \"Panchatantra\" (India 3rd century BC), but it is unknown to what extent these reflect the actual folk tales even of their own time. The stylistic evidence indicates that these, and many later collections, reworked folk tales into literary forms. What they do show is that the fairy tale has ancient roots, older than the \"Arabian Nights\" collection of magical tales (compiled \"circa\" 1500 AD), such as \"Vikram and the Vampire\", and \"Bel and the Dragon\". Besides such collections and individual tales, in China Taoist philosophers such as Liezi and Zhuangzi recounted fairy tales in their philosophical works. In the broader definition of the genre, the first famous Western fairy tales are those of Aesop (6th century BC) in ancient Greece.\nScholarship points out that Medieval literature contains early versions or predecessors of later known tales and motifs, such as the grateful dead, The Bird Lover or the quest for the lost wife. Recognizable folktales have also been reworked as the plot of folk literature and oral epics.\nJack Zipes writes in \"When Dreams Came True\", \"There are fairy tale elements in Chaucer's \"The Canterbury Tales\", Edmund Spenser's \"The Faerie Queene\", and\u00a0in many of William Shakespeare plays.\" \"King Lear\" can be considered a literary variant of fairy tales such as \"Water and Salt\" and \"Cap O' Rushes\". The tale itself resurfaced in Western literature in the 16th and 17th centuries, with \"The Facetious Nights of Straparola\" by Giovanni Francesco Straparola (Italy, 1550 and 1553), which contains many fairy tales in its inset tales, and the Neapolitan tales of Giambattista Basile (Naples, 1634\u201336), which are all fairy tales. Carlo Gozzi made use of many fairy tale motifs among his Commedia dell'Arte scenarios, including among them one based on \"The Love For Three Oranges\" (1761). Simultaneously, Pu Songling, in China, included many fairy tales in his collection, \"Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio\" (published posthumously, 1766), which has been described by Yuken Fujita of Keio University as having \"a reputation as the most outstanding short story collection.\" The fairy tale itself became popular among the \"pr\u00e9cieuses\" of upper-class France (1690\u20131710), and among the tales told in that time were the ones of La Fontaine and the \"Contes\" of Charles Perrault (1697), who fixed the forms of \"Sleeping Beauty\" and \"Cinderella\". Although Straparola's, Basile's and Perrault's collections contain the oldest known forms of various fairy tales, on the stylistic evidence, all the writers rewrote the tales for literary effect.\nThe Salon Era.\nIn the mid-17th century, a vogue for magical tales emerged among the intellectuals who frequented the salons of Paris. These salons were regular gatherings hosted by prominent aristocratic women, where women and men could gather together to discuss the issues of the day.\nIn the 1630s, aristocratic women began to gather in their own living rooms, salons, to discuss the topics of their choice: arts and letters, politics, and social matters of immediate concern to the women of their class: marriage, love, financial and physical independence, and access to education. This was a time when women were barred from receiving a formal education. Some of the most gifted women writers of the period came out of these early salons (such as Madeleine de Scud\u00e9ry and Madame de Lafayette), which encouraged women's independence and pushed against the gender barriers that defined their lives. The salonni\u00e8res argued particularly for love and intellectual compatibility between the sexes, opposing the system of arranged marriages.\nSometime in the middle of the 17th century, a passion for the conversational parlour game based on the plots of old folk tales swept through the salons. Each salonni\u00e8re was called upon to retell an old tale or rework an old theme, spinning clever new stories that not only showcased verbal agility and imagination but also slyly commented on the conditions of aristocratic life. Great emphasis was placed on a mode of delivery that seemed natural and spontaneous. The decorative language of the fairy tales served an important function: disguising the rebellious subtext of the stories and sliding them past the court censors. Critiques of court life (and even of the king) were embedded in extravagant tales and in dark, sharply dystopian ones. Not surprisingly, the tales by women often featured young (but clever) aristocratic girls whose lives were controlled by the arbitrary whims of fathers, kings, and elderly wicked fairies, as well as tales in which groups of wise fairies (i.e., intelligent, independent women) stepped in and put all to rights.\nThe salon tales as they were originally written and published have been preserved in a monumental work called \"Le Cabinet des F\u00e9es\", an enormous collection of stories from the 17th and 18th centuries.\nLater works.\nThe first collectors to attempt to preserve not only the plot and characters of the tale, but also the style in which they were told, was the Brothers Grimm, collecting German fairy tales; ironically, this meant although their first edition (1812 &amp; 1815) remains a treasure for folklorists, they rewrote the tales in later editions to make them more acceptable, which ensured their sales and the later popularity of their work.\nSuch literary forms did not merely draw from the folktale, but also influenced folktales in turn. The Brothers Grimm rejected several tales for their collection, though told orally to them by Germans, because the tales derived from Perrault, and they concluded they were thereby French and not German tales; an oral version of \"Bluebeard\" was thus rejected, and the tale of \"Little Briar Rose\", clearly related to Perrault's \"Sleeping Beauty\", was included only because Jacob Grimm convinced his brother that the figure of Brynhildr, from much earlier Norse mythology, proved that the sleeping princess was authentically Germanic folklore.\nThis consideration of whether to keep \"Sleeping Beauty\" reflected a belief common among folklorists of the 19th century: that the folk tradition preserved fairy tales in forms from pre-history except when \"contaminated\" by such literary forms, leading people to tell inauthentic tales. The rural, illiterate, and uneducated peasants, if suitably isolated, were the \"folk\" and would tell pure \"folk\" tales. Sometimes they regarded fairy tales as a form of fossil, the remnants of a once-perfect tale. However, further research has concluded that fairy tales never had a fixed form, and regardless of literary influence, the tellers constantly altered them for their own purposes.\nThe work of the Brothers Grimm influenced other collectors, both inspiring them to collect tales and leading them to similarly believe, in a spirit of romantic nationalism, that the fairy tales of a country were particularly representative of it, to the neglect of cross-cultural influence. Among those influenced were the Russian Alexander Afanasyev (first published in 1866), the Norwegians Peter Christen Asbj\u00f8rnsen and J\u00f8rgen Moe (first published in 1845), the Romanian Petre Ispirescu (first published in 1874), the English Joseph Jacobs (first published in 1890), and Jeremiah Curtin, an American who collected Irish tales (first published in 1890). Ethnographers collected fairy tales throughout the world, finding similar tales in Africa, the Americas, and Australia; Andrew Lang was able to draw on not only the written tales of Europe and Asia, but those collected by ethnographers, to fill his \"coloured\" fairy books series. They also encouraged other collectors of fairy tales, as when Yei Theodora Ozaki created a collection, \"Japanese Fairy Tales\" (1908), after encouragement from Lang. Simultaneously, writers such as Hans Christian Andersen and George MacDonald continued the tradition of literary fairy tales. Andersen's work sometimes drew on old folktales, but more often deployed fairytale motifs and plots in new tales. MacDonald incorporated fairytale motifs both in new literary fairy tales, such as \"The Light Princess\", and in works of the genre that would become fantasy, as in \"The Princess and the Goblin\" or \"Lilith\".\nCross-cultural transmission.\nTwo theories of origins have attempted to explain the common elements in fairy tales found spread over continents. One is that a single point of origin generated any given tale, which then spread over the centuries; the other is that such fairy tales stem from common human experience and therefore can appear separately in many different origins.\nFairy tales with very similar plots, characters, and motifs are found spread across many different cultures. Many researchers hold this to be caused by the spread of such tales, as people repeat tales they have heard in foreign lands, although the oral nature makes it impossible to trace the route except by inference. Folklorists have attempted to determine the origin by internal evidence, which can not always be clear; Joseph Jacobs, comparing the Scottish tale \"The Ridere of Riddles\" with the version collected by the Brothers Grimm, \"The Riddle\", noted that in \"The Ridere of Riddles\" one hero ends up polygamously married, which might point to an ancient custom, but in \"The Riddle\", the simpler riddle might argue greater antiquity.\nFolklorists of the \"Finnish\" (or historical-geographical) school attempted to place fairy tales to their origin, with inconclusive results. Sometimes influence, especially within a limited area and time, is clearer, as when considering the influence of Perrault's tales on those collected by the Brothers Grimm. \"Little Briar-Rose\" appears to stem from Perrault's \"The Sleeping Beauty\", as the Grimms' tale appears to be the only independent German variant. Similarly, the close agreement between the opening of the Grimms' version of \"Little Red Riding Hood\" and Perrault's tale points to an influence, although the Grimms' version adds a different ending (perhaps derived from \"The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids\").\nFairy tales tend to take on the color of their location, through the choice of motifs, the style in which they are told, and the depiction of character and local color.\nThe Brothers Grimm believed that European fairy tales derived from the cultural history shared by all Indo-European peoples and were therefore ancient, far older than written records. This view is supported by research by the anthropologist Jamie Tehrani and the folklorist Sara Graca Da Silva using phylogenetic analysis, a technique developed by evolutionary biologists to trace the relatedness of living and fossil species. Among the tales analysed were \"Jack and the Beanstalk\", traced to the time of splitting of Eastern and Western Indo-European, over 5000 years ago. Both \"Beauty and the Beast\" and \"Rumpelstiltskin\" appear to have been created some 4000 years ago. The story of \"The Smith and the Devil\" (Deal with the Devil) appears to date from the Bronze Age, some 6000 years ago. Various other studies converge to suggest that some fairy tales, for example the swan maiden, could go back to the Upper Palaeolithic.\nAssociation with children.\nOriginally, adults were the audience of a fairy tale just as often as children. Literary fairy tales appeared in works intended for adults, but in the 19th and 20th centuries the fairy tale became associated with children's literature.\nThe \"pr\u00e9cieuses\", including Madame d'Aulnoy, intended their works for adults, but regarded their source as the tales that servants, or other women of lower class, would tell to children. Indeed, a novel of that time, depicting a countess's suitor offering to tell such a tale, has the countess exclaim that she loves fairy tales as if she were still a child. Among the late \"pr\u00e9cieuses\", Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont redacted a version of \"Beauty and the Beast\" for children, and it is her tale that is best known today. The Brothers Grimm titled their collection \"Children's and Household Tales\" and rewrote their tales after complaints that they were not suitable for children.\nIn the modern era, fairy tales were altered so that they could be read to children. The Brothers Grimm concentrated mostly on sexual references; Rapunzel, in the first edition, revealed the prince's visits by asking why her clothing had grown tight, thus letting the witch deduce that she was pregnant, but in subsequent editions carelessly revealed that it was easier to pull up the prince than the witch. On the other hand, in many respects, violence\u200d\u2014\u200cparticularly when punishing villains\u200d\u2014\u200cwas increased. Other, later, revisions cut out violence; J.R.R.Tolkien noted that \"The Juniper Tree\" often had its cannibalistic stew cut out in a version intended for children. The moralizing strain in the Victorian era altered the classical tales to teach lessons, as when George Cruikshank rewrote \"Cinderella\" in 1854 to contain temperance themes. His acquaintance Charles Dickens protested, \"In an utilitarian age, of all other times, it is a matter of grave importance that fairy tales should be respected.\"\nPsychoanalysts such as Bruno Bettelheim, who regarded the cruelty of older fairy tales as indicative of psychological conflicts, strongly criticized this expurgation, because it weakened their usefulness to both children and adults as ways of symbolically resolving issues. Fairy tales do teach children how to deal with difficult times. To quote Rebecca Walters (2017, p.\u00a056) \"Fairytales and folktales are part of the cultural conserve that can be used to address children's fears\u2026. and give them some role training in an approach that honors the children's window of tolerance\". These fairy tales teach children how to deal with certain social situations and helps them to find their place in society. Fairy tales teach children other important lessons too. For example, Tsitsani et al. carried out a study on children to determine the benefits of fairy tales. Parents of the children who took part in the study found that fairy tales, especially the color in them, triggered their child's imagination as they read them. Jungian Analyst and fairy tale scholar Marie Louise Von Franz interprets fairy tales based on Jung's view of fairy tales as a spontaneous and naive product of soul, which can only express what soul is. That means, she looks at fairy tales as images of different phases of experiencing the reality of the soul. They are the \"purest and simplest expression of collective unconscious psychic processes\" and \"they represent the archetypes in their simplest, barest and most concise form\" because they are less overlaid with conscious material than myths and legends. \"In this pure form, the archetypal images afford us the best clues to the understanding of the processes going on in the collective psyche\". \"The fairy tale itself is its own best explanation; that is, its meaning is contained in the totality of its motifs connected by the thread of the story. [...] Every fairy tale is a relatively closed system compounding one essential psychological meaning which is expressed in a series of symbolical pictures and events and is discoverable in these\". \"I have come to the conclusion that all fairy tales endeavour to describe one and the same psychic fact, but a fact so complex and far-reaching and so difficult for us to realize in all its different aspects that hundreds of tales and thousands of repetitions with a musician's variation are needed until this unknown fact is delivered into consciousness; and even then the theme is not exhausted. This unknown fact is what Jung calls the Self, which is the psychic reality of the collective unconscious. [...] Every archetype is in its essence only one aspect of the collective unconscious as well as always representing also the whole collective unconscious.\nOther famous people commented on the importance of fairy tales, especially for children. For example, G. K. Chesterton argued that \"Fairy tales, then, are not responsible for producing in children fear, or any of the shapes of fear; fairy tales do not give the child the idea of the evil or the ugly; that is in the child already, because it is in the world already. Fairy tales do not give the child his first idea of bogey. What fairy tales give the child is his first clear idea of the possible defeat of bogey. The baby has known the dragon intimately ever since he had an imagination. What the fairy tale provides for him is a St. George to kill the dragon.\" Albert Einstein once showed how important he believed fairy tales were for children's intelligence in the quote \"If you want your children to be intelligent, read them fairytales. If you want them to be more intelligent, read them more fairytales.\"\nThe adaptation of fairy tales for children continues. Walt Disney's influential \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" was largely (although certainly not solely) intended for the children's market. The anime \"Magical Princess Minky Momo\" draws on the fairy tale \"Momotar\u014d\". Jack Zipes has spent many years working to make the older traditional stories accessible to modern readers and their children.\nMotherhood.\nMany fairy tales feature an absentee mother, as an example \"Beauty and the Beast\", \"The Little Mermaid\", \"Little Red Riding Hood\" and \"Donkeyskin\", where the mother is deceased or absent and unable to help the heroines. Mothers are depicted as absent or wicked in the most popular contemporary versions of tales like \"Rapunzel\", \"Snow White\", \"Cinderella\" and \"Hansel and Gretel\", however, some lesser known tales or variants such as those found in volumes edited by Angela Carter and Jane Yolen depict mothers in a more positive light.\nCarter's protagonist in \"The Bloody Chamber\" is an impoverished piano student married to a Marquis who was much older than herself to \"banish the spectre of poverty\". The story is a variant on Bluebeard, a tale about a wealthy man who murders numerous young women. Carter's protagonist, who is unnamed, describes her mother as \"eagle-featured\" and \"indomitable\". Her mother is depicted as a woman who is prepared for violence, instead of hiding from it or sacrificing herself to it. The protagonist recalls how her mother kept an \"antique service revolver\" and once \"shot a man-eating tiger with her own hand.\"\nContemporary tales.\nLiterary.\nIn contemporary literature, many authors have used the form of fairy tales for various reasons, such as examining the human condition from the simple framework a fairytale provides. Some authors seek to recreate a sense of the fantastic in a contemporary discourse. Some writers use fairy tale forms for modern issues; this can include using the psychological dramas implicit in the story, as when Robin McKinley retold \"Donkeyskin\" as the novel \"Deerskin\", with emphasis on the abusive treatment the father of the tale dealt to his daughter. Sometimes, especially in children's literature, fairy tales are retold with a twist simply for comic effect, such as \"The Stinky Cheese Man\" by Jon Scieszka and \"The ASBO Fairy Tales\" by Chris Pilbeam. A common comic motif is a world where all the fairy tales take place, and the characters are aware of their role in the story, such as in the film series \"Shrek\".\nOther authors may have specific motives, such as multicultural or feminist reevaluations of predominantly Eurocentric masculine-dominated fairy tales, implying critique of older narratives. The figure of the damsel in distress has been particularly attacked by many feminist critics. Examples of narrative reversal rejecting this figure include \"The Paperbag Princess\" by Robert Munsch, a picture book aimed at children in which a princess rescues a prince, Angela Carter's \"The Bloody Chamber\", which retells a number of fairy tales from a female point of view and Simon Hood's contemporary interpretation of various popular classics.\nThere are also many contemporary erotic retellings of fairy tales, which explicitly draw upon the original spirit of the tales, and are specifically for adults. Modern retellings focus on exploring the tale through use of the erotic, explicit sexuality, dark and/or comic themes, female empowerment, fetish and BDSM, multicultural, and heterosexual characters. Cleis Press has released several fairy tale-themed erotic anthologies, including \"Fairy Tale Lust\", \"Lustfully Ever After\", and \"A Princess Bound\".\nIt may be hard to lay down the rule between fairy tales and fantasies that use fairy tale motifs, or even whole plots, but the distinction is commonly made, even within the works of a single author: George MacDonald's \"Lilith\" and \"Phantastes\" are regarded as fantasies, while his \"The Light Princess\", \"The Golden Key\", and \"The Wise Woman\" are commonly called fairy tales. The most notable distinction is that fairytale fantasies, like other fantasies, make use of novelistic writing conventions of prose, characterization, or setting.\nFilm.\nFairy tales have been enacted dramatically; records exist of this in commedia dell'arte, and later in pantomime. Unlike oral and literacy form, fairy tales in film is considered one of the most effective way to convey the story to the audience. The advent of cinema has meant that such stories could be presented in a more plausible manner, with the use of special effects and animation. The Walt Disney Company has had a significant impact on the evolution of the fairy tale film. Some of the earliest short silent films from the Disney studio were based on fairy tales, and some fairy tales were adapted into shorts in the musical comedy series \"Silly Symphony\", such as \"Three Little Pigs\". Walt Disney's first feature-length film \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\", released in 1937, was a ground-breaking film for fairy tales and, indeed, fantasy in general. With the cost of over 400 percent of the budget and more than 300 artists, assistants and animators, \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" was arguably one of the highest work force demanded film at that time. The studio even hired Don Graham to open animation training programs for more than 700 staff. As for the motion capture and personality expression, the studio used a dancer, Marjorie Celeste, from the beginning to the end for the best results. Disney and his creative successors have returned to traditional and literary fairy tales numerous times with films such as \"Cinderella\" (1950), \"Sleeping Beauty\" (1959), \"The Little Mermaid\" (1989) and \"Beauty and the Beast\" (1991). Disney's influence helped establish the fairy tale genre as a genre for children, and has been accused by some of bowdlerizing the gritty naturalism\u00a0\u2013 and sometimes unhappy endings\u00a0\u2013 of many folk fairy tales. However, others note that the softening of fairy tales occurred long before Disney, some of which was even done by the Grimm brothers themselves.\nMany filmed fairy tales have been made primarily for children, from Disney's later works to Aleksandr Rou's retelling of \"Vasilissa the Beautiful\", the first Soviet film to use Russian folk tales in a big-budget feature. Others have used the conventions of fairy tales to create new stories with sentiments more relevant to contemporary life, as in \"Labyrinth\", \"My Neighbor Totoro\", \"Happily N'Ever After\", and the films of Michel Ocelot.\nOther works have retold familiar fairy tales in a darker, more horrific or psychological variant aimed primarily at adults. Notable examples are Jean Cocteau's \"Beauty and the Beast\" and \"The Company of Wolves\", based on Angela Carter's retelling of \"Little Red Riding Hood\". Likewise, \"Princess Mononoke\", \"Pan's Labyrinth\", \"Suspiria\", and \"Spike\" create new stories in this genre from fairy tale and folklore motifs.\nIn comics and animated TV series, \"The Sandman\", \"Hellboy\", \"Revolutionary Girl Utena\", \"Princess Tutu\", \"Fables\", and \"M\u00c4R\" all make use of standard fairy tale elements to various extents but are more accurately categorised as fairytale fantasy due to the definite locations and characters which a longer narrative requires.\nA more modern cinematic fairy tale would be Luchino Visconti's \"Le Notti Bianche\", starring Marcello Mastroianni before he became a superstar. It involves many of the romantic conventions of fairy tales, yet it takes place in post-World War II Italy, and it ends realistically.\nIn recent years, Disney has been dominating the fairy tale film industry by remaking their animated fairy tale films into live action. Examples include \"Maleficent\" (2014), \"Cinderella\" (2015), \"Beauty and the Beast\" (2017) and so on.\nMotifs.\nAny comparison of fairy tales quickly discovers that many fairy tales have features in common with each other. Two of the most influential classifications are those of Antti Aarne, as revised by Stith Thompson into the Aarne-Thompson classification system, and Vladimir Propp's \"Morphology of the Folk Tale\".\nAarne-Thompson.\nThis system groups fairy and folk tales according to their overall plot. Common, identifying features are picked out to decide which tales are grouped together. Much therefore depends on what features are regarded as decisive.\nFor instance, tales like \"Cinderella\"\u200d\u2014\u200cin which a persecuted heroine, with the help of the fairy godmother or similar magical helper, attends an event (or three) in which she wins the love of a prince and is identified as his true bride\u200d\u2014\u200care classified as type 510, the persecuted heroine. Some such tales are \"The Wonderful Birch\"; \"Aschenputtel\"; \"Katie Woodencloak\"; \"The Story of Tam and Cam\"; \"Ye Xian\"; \"Cap O' Rushes\"; \"Catskin\"; \"Fair, Brown and Trembling\"; \"Finette Cendron\"; \"Allerleirauh\".\nFurther analysis of the tales shows that in \"Cinderella\", \"The Wonderful Birch\", \"The Story of Tam and Cam\", \"Ye Xian\", and \"Aschenputtel\", the heroine is persecuted by her stepmother and refused permission to go to the ball or other event, and in \"Fair, Brown and Trembling\" and \"Finette Cendron\" by her sisters and other female figures, and these are grouped as 510A; while in \"Cap O' Rushes\", \"Catskin\", and \"Allerleirauh\", the heroine is driven from home by her father's persecutions, and must take work in a kitchen elsewhere, and these are grouped as 510B. But in \"Katie Woodencloak\", she is driven from home by her stepmother's persecutions and must take service in a kitchen elsewhere, and in \"Tattercoats\", she is refused permission to go to the ball by her grandfather. Given these features common with both types of 510, \"Katie Woodencloak\" is classified as 510A because the villain is the stepmother, and \"Tattercoats\" as 510B because the grandfather fills the father's role.\nThis system has its weaknesses in the difficulty of having no way to classify subportions of a tale as motifs. \"Rapunzel\" is type 310 (The Maiden in the Tower), but it opens with a child being demanded in return for stolen food, as does \"Puddocky\"; but \"Puddocky\" is not a Maiden in the Tower tale, while \"The Canary Prince\", which opens with a jealous stepmother, is.\nIt also lends itself to emphasis on the common elements, to the extent that the folklorist describes \"The Black Bull of Norroway\" as the same story as \"Beauty and the Beast\". This can be useful as a shorthand but can also erase the coloring and details of a story.\nMorphology.\nVladimir Propp specifically studied a collection of Russian fairy tales, but his analysis has been found useful for the tales of other countries. Having criticized Aarne-Thompson type analysis for ignoring what motifs \"did\" in stories, and because the motifs used were not clearly distinct, he analyzed the tales for the \"function\" each character and action fulfilled and concluded that a tale was composed of thirty-one elements ('functions') and seven characters or 'spheres of action' ('the princess and her father' are a single sphere). While the elements were not all required for all tales, when they appeared they did so in an invariant order\u00a0\u2013 except that each individual element might be negated twice, so that it would appear three times, as when, in \"Brother and Sister\", the brother resists drinking from enchanted streams twice, so that it is the third that enchants him. Propp's 31 functions also fall within six 'stages' (preparation, complication, transference, struggle, return, recognition), and a stage can also be repeated, which can affect the perceived order of elements.\nOne such element is the \"donor\" who gives the hero magical assistance, often after testing him. In \"The Golden Bird\", the talking fox tests the hero by warning him against entering an inn and, after he succeeds, helps him find the object of his quest; in \"The Boy Who Drew Cats\", the priest advised the hero to stay in small places at night, which protects him from an evil spirit; in \"Cinderella\", the fairy godmother gives Cinderella the dresses she needs to attend the ball, as their mothers' spirits do in \"Bawang Putih Bawang Merah\" and \"The Wonderful Birch\"; in \"The Fox Sister\", a Buddhist monk gives the brothers magical bottles to protect against the fox spirit. The roles can be more complicated. In \"The Red Ettin\", the role is split into the mother\u200d\u2014\u200cwho offers the hero the whole of a journey cake with her curse or half with her blessing\u200d\u2014\u200cand when he takes the half, a fairy who gives him advice; in \"Mr Simigd\u00e1li\", the sun, the moon, and the stars all give the heroine a magical gift. Characters who are not always the donor can act like the donor. In \"Kallo and the Goblins\", the villain goblins also give the heroine gifts, because they are tricked; in \"Schippeitaro\", the evil cats betray their secret to the hero, giving him the means to defeat them. Other fairy tales, such as \"The Story of the Youth Who Went Forth to Learn What Fear Was\", do not feature the donor.\nAnalogies have been drawn between this and the analysis of myths into the hero's journey.\nInterpretations.\nMany fairy tales have been interpreted for their (purported) significance. One mythological interpretation saw many fairy tales, including \"Hansel and Gretel\", \"Sleeping Beauty\", and \"The Frog King\", as solar myths; this mode of interpretation subsequently became rather less popular. Freudian, Jungian, and other psychological analyses have also explicated many tales, but no mode of interpretation has established itself definitively.\nSpecific analyses have often been criticized for lending great importance to motifs that are not, in fact, integral to the tale; this has often stemmed from treating one instance of a fairy tale as the definitive text, where the tale has been told and retold in many variations. In variants of \"Bluebeard\", the wife's curiosity is betrayed by a blood-stained key, by an egg's breaking, or by the singing of a rose she wore, without affecting the tale, but interpretations of specific variants have claimed that the precise object is integral to the tale.\nOther folklorists have interpreted tales as historical documents. Many German folklorists, believing the tales to have preserved details from ancient times, have used the Grimms' tales to explain ancient customs.\nOne approach sees the topography of European M\u00e4rchen as echoing the period immediately following the last Ice Age.\nOther folklorists have explained the figure of the wicked stepmother in a historical/sociological context: many women did die in childbirth, their husbands remarried, and the new stepmothers competed with the children of the first marriage for resources.\nIn a 2012 lecture, Jack Zipes reads fairy tales as examples of what he calls \"childism\". He suggests that there are terrible aspects to the tales, which (among other things) have conditioned children to accept mistreatment and even abuse.\nFairy tales in music.\nFairy tales have inspired music, namely opera, such as the French Op\u00e9ra f\u00e9erie and the German M\u00e4rchenoper. French examples include Gretry's \"Z\u00e9mire et Azor\", and Auber's \"Le cheval de bronze\", German operas are Mozart's \"Die Zauberfl\u00f6te\", Humperdinck's \"H\u00e4nsel und Gretel\", Siegfried Wagner's \"An allem ist H\u00fctchen schuld!\", which is based on many fairy tales, and Carl Orff's \"Die Kluge\".\nBallet, too, is fertile ground for bringing fairy tales to life. Igor Stravinsky's first ballet, The Firebird uses elements from various classic Russian tales in that work.\nEven contemporary fairy tales have been written for the purpose of inspiration in the music world. \"Raven Girl\" by Audrey Niffenegger was written to inspire a new dance for the Royal Ballet in London. The song \"Singring and the Glass Guitar\" by the American band Utopia, recorded for their album \"Ra\", is called \"An Electrified Fairytale\". Composed by the four members of the band, Roger Powell, Kasim Sulton, Willie Wilcox and Todd Rundgren, it tells the story of the theft of the Glass Guitar by Evil Forces, which has to be recovered by the four heroes.\nCompilations.\nAuthors and works:\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOn origin and migration of folktales:\nCovering a three hundred year time frame, the print collection encompasses European, American, and Asian tales, including several rare editions by authors like the Brothers Grimm."}

In 1975, Robinson became the first Black manager in big-league history, as the player-manager of the Indians.\nThe first player to be named Most Valuable Player (MVP) of both the National League (NL) and the American League (AL), Robinson was named the NL MVP after leading the Cincinnati Reds to the pennant in 1961 and was named the AL MVP in 1966 with the Baltimore Orioles after winning the Triple Crown; Robinson's 49 home runs (HR) that year tied for the most by any AL player between 1962 and 1989, and stood as a franchise record for 30 years. He helped lead the Orioles to the first two World Series titles in franchise history in 1966 and 1970, and was named the Series MVP in 1966 after leading the Orioles to a four-game sweep of the Los Angeles Dodgers.\nA 14-time All-Star, Robinson batted .300 nine times, hit 30 home runs 11 times, and led his league in slugging four times and in runs scored three times. His 586 career home runs ranked fourth in major league history at the time of his retirement, and he ranked sixth in total bases (5,373) and extra-base hits (1,186), eighth in games played (2,808), and ninth in runs scored (1,829). His 2,943 career hits are the most since 1934 by any player who fell short of the 3,000-hit mark. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 1982.\nAfter managing the Indians, Robinson went on to manage the San Francisco Giants, Baltimore Orioles, and Montreal Expos / Washington Nationals. For most of the last two decades of his life, Robinson served in various executive positions for Major League Baseball concluding his career as honorary president of the American League.\nEarly life.\nRobinson was born in Beaumont, Texas. He was the youngest of Ruth Shaw's ten children and the only child of her marriage to Frank Robinson. His parents divorced when he was an infant, and his mother moved with her children to Alameda, California, and then to the West Oakland neighborhood of nearby Oakland. He attended McClymonds High School in Oakland where he was a basketball teammate of Bill Russell. He was a baseball teammate of Vada Pinson and Curt Flood. He also played American Legion Baseball.\nPlaying career.\nMinor leagues.\nIn 1953, Bobby Mattick, a scout for the Cincinnati Reds, signed Robinson to a contract worth $3,500 ($ in current dollar terms). He made his professional debut for the Ogden Reds of the Class C Pioneer League. He batted .348 with 17 home runs and 83 runs batted in (RBI) in 72 games played. He was promoted to the Tulsa Oilers of the Class AA Texas League in 1954, but was demoted to the Columbia Reds of the Class A South Atlantic League. He returned to Columbia in 1955.\nMajor Leagues.\nCincinnati Redlegs / Reds (1956\u20131965).\nRobinson made his major league debut on April 17, 1956 at the age of 20. After posting 11 consecutive losing seasons, the Reds surprised their opposition by jumping to first place at the mid-point of the 1956 season. Robinson led the team with 18 home runs at mid-season, earning him the role as starting left fielder for the National League in the 1956 All-Star Game. The Reds stayed in the pennant race until the last day of the season, ending up with a 91\u201363 record, two games behind the Brooklyn Dodgers.\nRobinson ended the 1956 season with a .290 batting average and 83 RBIs, and his 38 home runs tied the Major League Baseball record for home runs hit by a Rookie player previously set by Wally Berger in . His rookie home run record stood for 31 years when it was broken by Mark McGwire's 49 home runs in . His impressive power hitting display earned him the National League Rookie of the Year Award.\nIn 1957, the Reds were once again in first place at mid-season when, Robinson and six of his Redleg teammates\u2014Ed Bailey, Johnny Temple, Don Hoak, Gus Bell, Wally Post and Roy McMillan\u2014were voted into the National League starting lineup for the 1957 All-Star Game. An investigation launched by Commissioner Ford C. Frick found that the majority of the ballots cast had come from Cincinnati as the result of a ballot stuffing campaign by Reds fans.\nFrick allowed Robinson to remain on the team while Bell and Post were replaced on the NL starting roster by outfielders Hank Aaron and Willie Mays. Bell remained as a reserve player, but Post was removed from the roster altogether. Subsequently, Frick suspended fans' All-Star game voting rights until they were eventually restored in 1970. The Reds faltered after the All-Star break and dropped to fourth place in the season final standings.\nRobinson earned the 1957 \"Associated Press\" National League Sophomore-of-the-Year award by improving his batting average to .322, tying him with Hank Aaron for third place in the 1957 NL batting championship race behind future Hall of Fame members Stan Musial (.366) and Willie Mays (.333). He credited manager, Birdie Tebbetts for his performance saying, \"He kept after me all year and that's what a young ball player needs.\" In 1958, Robinson would win the only Gold Glove Award of his career however, his batting average dropped to .269 as the Reds fell to last place in the National League, prompting Tebbetts to announce his resignation on August 14. In 1959, Robinson improved to a .311 batting average along with 36 home runs and 125 RBIs in 146 games. He also enjoyed a productive 1960, batting .297 with 31 home runs and 83 RBIs in 139 games. That year, Robinson led the major leagues in slugging percentage (.595) and on-base plus slugging (1.002), and also ranked first in the NL in hit by pitches (nine).\nIn 1961, Robinson moved to right field and produced another strong offensive season. In July he batted .409, hit 13 home runs, and drove in 34 runs to win NL Player of the Month Award, and finished the season with a .323 batting average with 37 home runs and 124 RBIs in 153 games, helping to propel the Reds to the National League pennant. His performance earned him the 1961 National League Most Valuable Player Award. In the 1961 World Series against the New York Yankees, Robinson had a lackluster performance, producing only three hits as the Reds fell to the Yankees in five games.\nRobinson hit a career-high .342 in 1962, just four points behind the NL batting champion, Tommy Davis. He also led the league in runs scored (134), doubles (51), on-base percentage (.421), slugging percentage (.624) and on-base plus slugging (1.045). Robinson's season totals for runs scored, doubles, RBIs (136) and on-base percentage were also career-highs.\nRobinson was noted as a fiercely aggressive player. He spiked Johnny Logan in 1957, causing Logan to miss six weeks. In a game against the Milwaukee Braves on August 15, 1960, Robinson slid hard into third base, prompting a fistfight with Milwaukee's future Hall of Fame third baseman, Eddie Mathews.\nBaltimore Orioles (1966\u20131971).\nOn December 9, 1965, Reds owner Bill DeWitt traded Robinson to the Baltimore Orioles in exchange for pitcher Milt Pappas, pitcher Jack Baldschun, and outfielder Dick Simpson. The trade turned out to be very lopsided. DeWitt, who had a slew of successful trades including his time as general manager in Detroit and the early 1960s rebuilding the Reds, famously referred to Robinson as \"not a young 30\" after the trade. The Reds led the NL in offense in 1965 and needed pitching. Pappas, who was a consistent performer in Baltimore was a major disappointment in Cincinnati while Robinson had continued success in Baltimore. In Robinson's first year in Baltimore, he won the Triple Crown, leading the American League with a .316 batting average (then the lowest ever by a Triple Crown winner), a career high 49 home runs (the most ever by a right-handed Triple crown winner) and 122 RBIs in 155 games. On May 8, 1966, Robinson became the only player ever to hit a home run completely out of Memorial Stadium. The shot came off of Luis Tiant in the second game of a doubleheader against the Cleveland Indians, and the home run measured . Until the Orioles' move to Camden Yards in 1992, a flag labeled \"HERE\" was flown at the spot where the ball left the stadium.\nThe Orioles won the 1966 World Series, and Robinson was named World Series Most Valuable Player. In the Orioles' four-game sweep of the defending champion Los Angeles Dodgers, Robinson hit two home runs\u2014one in Game 1 (which Baltimore won 5\u20132), and one in Game 4 (the only run of the game in a 1\u20130 series-clinching victory). Robinson hit both home runs off of Don Drysdale.\nDuring the 1969 season, Robinson brought some humor to the Orioles' clubhouse by presiding over their kangaroo court, held after every Oriole win. As the judge, he would hear arguments from both sides and give out fines for minor infractions (such as one dollar per lady talked to during a game) and \"awards\", named after people notoriously bad at a certain skill and involving a prop the \"winner\" had to display until the next court session. For instance, Jim Palmer once won the John Mason Baserunning Award, a smelly, decrepit baseball cleat presented for baserunning gaffes. Palmer credited the kangaroo court for helping the Orioles bond as a team.\nOn June 26, 1970, Robinson hit back-to-back grand slams in the fifth and sixth innings in the Orioles' 12\u20132 victory over the Washington Senators. The same runners were on base both times: Dave McNally was on third base, Don Buford was on second, and Paul Blair was on first.\nThe Orioles won three consecutive American League pennants between 1969 and 1971. Before the 1969 World Series, Robinson said, \"Bring on the Mets and Ron Gaspar!\" He was told by his teammate Merv Rettenmund, \"It's Rod, stupid.\" He then retorted by saying, \"OK. Bring on Rod Stupid!\" Baltimore won the 1970 World Series over the Reds.\nFinal years as a player (1972\u20131976).\nRobinson was traded along with Pete Richert from the Orioles to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Doyle Alexander, Bob O'Brien, Sergio Robles and Royle Stillman at the Winter Meetings on December 2, 1971. When the 1972 Major League Baseball strike occurred, Robinson was one of three Dodgers out of thirty who voted against it. When the vote was announced, he said, \"I don't believe in the strike, and I voted against it. But I was voted down, so now I'm on your side. I'm with you guys.\" The 1972 season was his first season in the National League since playing with the 1965 Reds. He played 103 games while compiling a .251 batting average, 59 RBIs, 86 hits, and 19 home runs. Teammate Tommy John said, \"Frank didn't have a great year in 1972, but he played hard all year...He set a positive role model for the team.\"\nRobinson's only season with the Dodgers ended when he was dealt along with Bill Singer, Bobby Valentine, Billy Grabarkewitz and Mike Strahler to the California Angels for Andy Messersmith and Ken McMullen at the Winter Meetings on November 28, 1972. The transaction was the result of Robinson's request for regular playing time, something Dodgers general manager Al Campanis wanted for the team's younger prospects. It also reunited him with Angels general manager Harry Dalton who had worked in a similar capacity when both were with the Orioles. In his time with the Angels, he became their first designated hitter while also being teammates again with Vada Pinson. He played 147 games in 1973 and 129 in 1974. In his tenure with the Angels, he hit for a .259 average while posting 50 home runs, 249 hits, and 160 RBIs in 276 games.\nOn September 12, 1974, the Angels traded Robinson to the Cleveland Indians for Ken Suarez, cash and a player to be named later (Rusty Torres). Three weeks later, the Indians named him their manager and persuaded him to continue playing. In his first at-bat as a player/manager for Cleveland in 1975, he hit a home run off of Doc Medich of the Yankees. He injured his shoulder in 1975 and did not play often. He retired from playing after the 1976 season, after batting .226 with 14 home runs in 235 at-bats for Cleveland from 1974 through 1976. His final at-bat in the majors came against Baltimore on September 18, where he pinch-hit in the eighth inning and collected an RBI base hit in a 3\u20132 loss.\nCareer statistics.\nDuring a 21-year baseball career, he batted .294 with 586 home runs, 1,812 runs batted in, and 2,943 hits. At his retirement, his 586 career home runs were the fourth most in history (behind only the records of Hank Aaron, Babe Ruth and Willie Mays). He is third on Cincinnati's all-time home run leaders list (324, behind Johnny Bench and Joey Votto) and is the Reds' all-time leader in slugging percentage (.554).\nIn his career, Robinson held several major league records. In his rookie season, he tied Wally Berger's record for home runs by a rookie (38). (The current record would be set by Pete Alonso in 2019.) Robinson still holds the record for home runs on Opening Day (8), which includes a home run in his first at bat as a player-manager.\nRobinson won the 1966 American League Triple Crown (.316 batting average, 49 home runs, 122 RBIs). Only two players (Carl Yastrzemski and Miguel Cabrera) have since won the award in either league and the two MVP awards, which made him the first player in baseball history to earn the title in both leagues.\nManager.\nManaging career.\nRobinson managed in the winter leagues late in his playing career. By the early 1970s, he had his heart set on becoming the first black manager in the majors; the Angels traded him to the Cleveland Indians midway through the 1974 season due to his open campaigning for the manager's job. He was appointed player-manager by the Indians on October 2, 1974, giving him the distinction of being the first black manager in the Majors. On April 8, 1975, Robinson made his debut as a player-manager; batting second as the designated hitter, he hit a home run (his 575th in his career) in the bottom of the 1st inning as the team prevailed 5\u20133 over the New York Yankees. Robinson had a rocky time in Cleveland, as general manager Phil Seghi generally liked to second guess his manager along with trying to push for him to play alongside managing (the result was that he played roughly 80 games as manager). Disagreements with players such as Gaylord Perry did not help matters (he went to the press saying he wanted to be paid a dollar more than Robinson's $173,500 salary). The Indians had a 79\u201380 record, and had an 81\u201378 record in 1976, their first winning record in eight years. Cleveland started the 1977 season 26\u201331 and fired Robinson on June 19, 1977.\nRobinson managed the San Francisco Giants from 1981 through 106 games of the 1984 season, when he was fired. He finished the 1984 season as the hitting coach for the Milwaukee Brewers on a contract worth $1. In 1985, he joined the Orioles' front office. On April 12, 1988, Robinson was named manager of the Orioles, replacing Cal Ripken Sr. after an 0\u20136 start to the season. He was awarded the American League Manager of the Year Award in 1989 for leading the Orioles to an 87\u201375 record, a turnaround from their previous season in which they went 54\u2013107, and the division title came down to the final three-game series between Baltimore and the Toronto Blue Jays, but the Jays would win the first two games to clinch the division. It would be the closest Robinson ever came to managing a team to the postseason.\nRobinson was fired by the Orioles in May 1991. After he had spent some years known in baseball as the Director of Discipline, Robinson was chosen by MLB to manage the Montreal Expos in February 2002, which MLB owned at that time. The Expos, who had losing records in the five previous seasons, finished the 2002 and 2003 seasons with 83\u201379 records. The Expos then next slumped to a 67\u201395 record in 2004, their final season before relocation to Washington, D.C.\nIn a June 2005 \"Sports Illustrated\" poll of 450 MLB players, Robinson was selected as the worst manager in baseball, along with Buck Showalter, then manager of the Texas Rangers. In the August 2006 poll, he again was voted worst manager with 17% of the vote and 37.7% of the NL East vote.\nOn April 20, 2006, with the Nationals' 10\u20134 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies, Robinson got his 1,000th win, becoming the 53rd manager to reach that milestone. He had earned his 1,000th loss two seasons earlier.\nDuring a game against the Houston Astros on May 25, 2006, Robinson pulled Nationals catcher Matt LeCroy during the middle of the seventh inning, violating an unwritten rule that managers do not remove position players in the middle of an inning. Instead, managers are supposed to discreetly switch position players in between innings. However, LeCroy, the third-string catcher, had allowed Astros baserunners to steal seven bases over seven innings and had committed two throwing errors. Although the Nationals won the game 8\u20135, Robinson found the decision so difficult to make on a player he respected so much, he broke down crying during post-game interviews.\nOn September 30, 2006, the Nationals' management declined to renew Robinson's contract for the 2007 season, though they stated he was welcome to come to spring training in an unspecified role. Robinson, who wanted either a front office job or a consultancy, declined. On October 1, he managed his final game, a 6\u20132 loss to the Mets, and prior to the game addressed the fans at RFK Stadium. Robinson's record as a manager stood at 1,065 wins and 1,176 losses. He is one of just seven managers to have won 1,000 games without having made the postseason, and he is the only one to do it since the Expansion Era began in 1961. Five of the other such managers won pennants in the 19th century, while the sixth, Jimmy Dykes, retired as a manager in 1961.\nHonors.\nIn addition to his two Most Valuable Player awards (1961 and 1966) and his World Series Most Valuable Player award (1966), Robinson was honored in 1966 with the Hickok Belt as the top professional athlete of the year in any sport.\nIn 1982, Robinson was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame as a Baltimore Oriole. Robinson is also a charter member of the Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame (along with Brooks Robinson), and a member of the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame, being inducted into both in 1978. He was named to the Washington Nationals Ring of Honor for his \"significant contribution to the game of baseball in Washington, D.C.\" on May 9, 2015. He was inducted into the Cleveland Indians Hall of Fame in 2016. The Reds, Orioles, and Indians have retired his uniform number 20. He is one of only two major-league players, the other being Nolan Ryan, to have his number retired by three different organizations.\nIn 1999, Robinson ranked 22nd on \"The Sporting News\" list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players. He was nominated as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In 2020, \"The Athletic\" ranked Robinson at number 20 on its \"Baseball 100\" list, complied by sportswriter Joe Posnanski.\nThree teams have honored Robinson with statues: \nAwards.\nPresident George W. Bush awarded Robinson the Presidential Medal of Freedom on November 9, 2005.\nThe citation on the award read:\nOn April 13, 2007, Robinson was awarded the first Jackie Robinson Society Community Recognition Award at George Washington University.\nFront office and media career.\nRobinson served as an assistant general manager for the Orioles through 1995 when he was fired. He worked for MLB as vice president of on-field operations from 1999 to 2002. He was responsible for player discipline, uniform policy, stadium configuration, and other on-field issues.\nRobinson served as an analyst for ESPN during spring training in 2007. The Nationals offered to honor Robinson during a May 20 game against his former club, the Baltimore Orioles, but he refused.\nIn 2007, Robinson rejoined the MLB front office serving as a special advisor for baseball operations from 2007 to 2009. He then served as special assistant to Bud Selig from 2009 to 2010 and was named senior vice president for major league operations from 2010 to 2011. In June 2012, he became executive vice president of baseball development. In February 2015, Robinson left that position and was named senior advisor to the Commissioner of Baseball and honorary American League president.\nPersonal life.\nWhile playing for the Reds in the late 1950s, Robinson attended Xavier University in Cincinnati during the off-season. While in Baltimore, he became active in the civil rights movement. He originally declined membership in the NAACP unless the organization promised not to make him do public appearances. However, after witnessing Baltimore's segregated housing and discriminatory real estate practices, he reconsidered and became an enthusiastic speaker on racial issues.\nOn February 9, 1961, Robinson pulled a .25 caliber pistol during an argument in a Cincinnati restaurant. He pleaded guilty on March 20 to a charge of carrying a concealed weapon and was sentenced to pay a $250 fine ().\nRobinson met Barbara Ann Cole in 1961; they married that year and lived in Los Angeles where Barbara sold real estate. They had two children. In 2003, he guest starred on an episode of \"Yes, Dear\" as himself, along with Ernie Banks and Johnny Bench.\nOn February 7, 2019, Robinson died of bone cancer in Los Angeles at the age of 83.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was accidentally created, as a ghost word, by the staff of G. and C. Merriam Company (now part of Merriam-Webster) in the \"New International Dictionary\", second edition (1934). That dictionary defined the term as a synonym for density used in physics and chemistry in the following way:\ndord (d\u00f4rd), \"n. Physics &amp; Chem.\" Density.\nPhilip Babcock Gove, an editor at Merriam-Webster who became editor-in-chief of \"Webster's Third New International Dictionary\", wrote a letter to the journal \"American Speech\", fifteen years after the error was caught, in which he explained how the \"dord\" error was introduced and corrected.\nOn 31 July 1931, Austin M. Patterson, the dictionary's chemistry editor, sent in a slip reading \"D or d, cont./density.\" This was intended to add \"density\" to the existing list of words that the letter \"D\" can abbreviate. The phrase \"D or d\" was misinterpreted as a single, run-together word: \"Dord\". This was a plausible mistake because headwords on slips were typed with spaces between the letters, so \"D\u00a0or\u00a0d\" looked very much like \"D\u00a0o\u00a0r\u00a0d\". The original slip went missing, so a new slip was prepared for the printer, which assigned a part of speech (noun) and a pronunciation. The would-be word was not questioned or corrected by proofreaders. The entry appeared on page 771 of the dictionary 1934, between the entries for \"Dorcopsis\" (a type of small kangaroo) and dor\u00e9 (golden in color).\nOn 28 February 1939, an editor noticed \"dord\" lacked an etymology and investigated, discovering the error. An order was sent to the printer marked \"plate change/imperative/urgent\". The non-word \"dord\" was excised; \"density\" was added as an additional meaning for the abbreviation \"D or d\" as originally intended, and the definition of the adjacent entry \"Dor\u00e9 furnace\" was expanded from \"A furnace for refining Dor\u00e9 bullion\" to \"a furnace in which Dor\u00e9 bullion is refined\" to close up the space. Gove wrote that this was \"probably too bad, for why shouldn't \"dord\" mean 'density'?\" In 1940, bound books began appearing without the ghost word, although inspection of printed copies well into the 1940s shows \"dord\" still present. The entry \"dord\" was not completely removed until 1947.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its usage in English dates to before 1689.\nEtymology.\n\"Ganja\" is borrowed from Hindi (, IPA: ]), a name for cannabis in the Indo-Aryan language that descended from an early form of Vedic Sanskrit. The Sanskrit refers to a \"powerful preparation from \"Cannabis sativa\"\". But the word only refers to a certain product derived from cannabis plants. \"G\u0101\u00f1j\u0101\" is the title given to the flowers, whereas \u201c\"charas\"\u201d refers to the resin, and \u201c\"bhang\"\u201d the seeds and leaves.\nThe word ganja reached the Western world through victims of slavery. Victims of the Atlantic slave trade were brought from Africa to Jamaica in 1513. In 1845, the British Empire started to call for indentured Indians to come to the Caribbean to strengthen the workforce on sugar plantations. They brought with them elements of their culture, including ganja.\nOne academic source places the date of introduction of ganja in Jamaica at 1845. The term came with 19th century workers whose descendants are now known as Indo-Jamaicans.\nThe word was used in Europe as early as 1856, when the British enacted a tax on the \"ganja\" trade.\nIn 1913, Jamaica banned cannabis with the Ganja Law.\nContemporary use of the term \"ganja\".\nEnglish use.\n\"Ganja\" is the most common term for marijuana in the Caribbean brought by the Indian indentured laborers.\nIn popular culture.\nCultural figureheads such as Bob Marley popularized Rastafari and ganja through reggae music. In 1976, Peter Tosh defended the use of ganja in the song \"Legalize It\". The hip hop group Cypress Hill revived the term in the United States in 2004 in a song titled \"Ganja Bus\", followed by other artists, including rapper Eminem, in the 2009 song \"Must Be the Ganja\".\nIn other languages.\nDerivatives of the term are used as generic words for marijuana in several languages, such as Indonesian/Malay (), Khmer (, ), Lao (, ), Thai (, ), Tiwi (), and Vietnamese ().\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Edith Stein was murdered in the gas chamber at the Auschwitz II-Birkenau concentration camp on 9 August 1942, and is canonized as a martyr and saint of the Catholic Church; she is also one of six patron saints of Europe.\nStein was born into an observant German Jewish family, but had become an agnostic by her teenage years. Moved by the tragedies of World War I, in 1915, she took lessons to become a nursing assistant and worked in an infectious diseases hospital. After completing her doctoral thesis at the University of Freiburg in 1916, she obtained an assistantship to Edmund Husserl there.\nFrom reading the life of the reformer of the Carmelites, Teresa of \u00c1vila, Stein was drawn to the Christian faith. She was baptized on 1 January 1922 into the Catholic Church. At that point, she wanted to become a Discalced Carmelite nun but was dissuaded by her spiritual mentor, the archabbot of Beuron, Raphael Walzer OSB. She then taught at a Jewish school of education in Speyer. As a result of the requirement of an \"Aryan certificate\" for civil servants promulgated by the Nazi government in April 1933 as part of its Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, she had to quit her teaching position.\nEdith Stein was admitted as a student to the study of religion to the Discalced Carmelite monastery in Cologne on 25 November, on the first vespers of the feast of Saint Teresa of \u00c1vila, and received the religious habit as a novice in April 1934, taking the religious name \"Teresia Benedicta a Cruce\" (Teresia in remembrance of Teresa of \u00c1vila, Benedicta in honour of Benedict of Nursia). She made her temporary vows on 21 April 1935, and her perpetual vows on 21 April 1938.\nThe same year, Teresa Benedicta a Cruce and her biological sister Rosa, by then also a convert and an extern (tertiary of the order, who would handle the community's needs outside the monastery), were sent to the Carmelite monastery in Echt, Netherlands, for their safety. In response to the pastoral letter from the Dutch bishops on 26 July 1942, in which they made the treatment of the Jews by the Nazis a central theme, all baptized Catholics of Jewish origin (according to police reports, 244 people) were arrested by the Gestapo on the following Sunday, 2 August 1942. They were sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp, and were murdered in the Birkenau gas chambers on 9 August 1942.\nEarly life.\nEdith Stein was born in Breslau (now Wroc\u0142aw, Poland), Lower Silesia, into an observant Jewish family. She was the youngest of 11 children and was born on Yom Kippur, an important Jewish festival of the Hebrew calendar; these facts combined to make her a favorite of her mother. She was a very gifted child who enjoyed learning, in a home where her mother encouraged critical thinking, and she greatly admired her mother's unwavering religious faith. By her teenage years, however, Stein had become an agnostic.\nThough her father died while she was young, her widowed mother was determined to give her children a thorough education and consequently sent Edith to study at the Schlesische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t in Breslau. At age 19, Stein moved with her family to Breslau to a house bought by her mother, which she later described in her \"Autobiography\". Today, Edith Stein House hosts a museum dedicated to the history of the Stein family.\nAcademic career.\nIn April 1913, Stein arrived at the University of G\u00f6ttingen in order to study for the summer semester with Edmund Husserl. By the end of the summer, she had decided to pursue her doctoral degree in philosophy under Husserl and chose empathy as her thesis topic. Her studies were interrupted in July 1914 because of the outbreak of World War I. She then served as a volunteer wartime Red Cross nurse in an uninfectious diseases hospital at M\u00e4hrisch Wei\u00dfkirchen from 7 April to 1 September 1915. In 1916, Stein moved to the University of Freiburg in order to complete her dissertation on Empathy. Shortly before receiving her degree from Freiburg she agreed to become Husserl's assistant there. In this role, she differed with Husserl on important issues and made unique contributions to phenomenology as a whole. Her dissertation entitled \"Das Einf\u00fchlungsproblem in seiner historischen Entwicklung und in ph\u00e4nomenologischer Betrachtung\" (\"The Empathy Problem as it Developed Historically and Considered Phenomenologically\") was awarded a doctorate in philosophy with the \"summa cum laude\" honor. Stein then became a member of the faculty at Freiburg, where she worked until 1918 as a teaching assistant to Husserl, who had transferred to that institution. The University of G\u00f6ttingen rejected her habilitation thesis in 1919. Although Stein passed her doctoral examination with distinction, her attempts to habilitate failed due to the fact that Stein was a woman.\nHer rejected habilitation thesis, \"Beitr\u00e4ge zur philosophischen Begr\u00fcndung der Psychologie und der Geisteswissenschaften\" (\"Contributions to the Philosophical Foundations of Psychology and the Human Sciences\"), was published in the \"Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Philosophie und ph\u00e4nomenologische Forschung\" in 1922. She is categorized as a realistic phenomenologist.\nWhile Stein had earlier contacts with Catholicism, it was her reading of the autobiography of the mystic Teresa of \u00c1vila during summer holidays in Bad Bergzabern in 1921 that prompted her conversion and eventually the desire to seek the life of a Discalced Carmelite. Baptized on 1 January 1922, and dissuaded by her spiritual advisers from immediately seeking entry to the enclosed and hidden life of a Carmelite nun, Stein obtained a position to teach at the Dominican nuns' school in Speyer from 1923 to 1931. While there, Stein translated Thomas Aquinas' \"De Veritate\" (\"Of Truth\") into German, familiarized herself with Catholic philosophy in general and tried to bridge the phenomenology of her former teacher, Husserl, to Thomism. She visited Husserl and Heidegger at Freiburg in April 1929, the same month that Heidegger gave a speech to Husserl on his 70th birthday. In 1932 she became a lecturer at the Catholic Church-affiliated Institute for Scientific Pedagogy in M\u00fcnster, but antisemitic legislation passed by the Nazi government forced her to resign the post in 1933. In a letter to Pope Pius XI, she denounced the Nazi regime and asked the Pope to openly denounce the regime \"to put a stop to this abuse of Christ's name.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As a child of the Jewish people who, by the grace of God, for the past eleven years has also been a child of the Catholic Church, I dare to speak to the Father of Christianity about that which oppresses millions of Germans. For weeks we have seen deeds perpetrated in Germany which mock any sense of justice and humanity, not to mention love of neighbor. For years the leaders of National Socialism have been preaching hatred of the Jews ... But the responsibility must fall, after all, on those who brought them to this point and it also falls on those who keep silent in the face of such happenings.\nEverything that happened and continues to happen on a daily basis originates with a government that calls itself 'Christian'. For weeks not only Jews but also thousands of faithful Catholics in Germany, and, I believe, all over the world, have been waiting and hoping for the Church of Christ to raise its voice to put a stop to this abuse of Christ's name. Is not this idolization of race and governmental power which is being pounded into the public consciousness by the radio open heresy? Isn't the effort to destroy Jewish blood an abuse of the holiest humanity of our Savior, of the most blessed Virgin and the apostles? Is not all this diametrically opposed to the conduct of our Lord and Savior, who, even on the cross, still prayed for his persecutors? And isn't this a black mark on the record of this Holy Year which was intended to be a year of peace and reconciliation? We all, who are faithful children of the Church and who see the conditions in Germany with open eyes, fear the worst for the prestige of the Church, if the silence continues any longer.\nHer letter received no answer, and it is not known for certain whether the Pope ever saw it. However, in 1937 the Pope issued an encyclical written in German, \"Mit brennender Sorge\" (according to its German first words, lit. \"With deep anxiety\"), in which he criticized Nazism, listed violations of the Concordat between Germany and the Church of 1933, and condemned antisemitism.\nDiscalced Carmelite nun and martyr.\nStein entered the Discalced Carmelite monastery St. Maria vom Frieden (Our Lady of Peace) in Cologne-Lindenthal in October 1933 and took the religious name \"Teresia Benedicta a Cruce\" (Teresa Benedicta of the Cross). In Cologne she wrote her metaphysical book \"Endliches und ewiges Sein\" (\"Finite and Eternal Being\"), which attempted to combine the philosophies of Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus and Husserl.\nTo avoid the growing Nazi threat, the order transferred Edith and her sister, Rosa, who was also a convert and an extern sister of the Carmel, to the Discalced Carmelite monastery in Echt, Netherlands. There she wrote \"Studie \u00fcber Joannes a Cruce: Kreuzeswissenschaft\" (\"Studies on John of the Cross: The Science of the Cross\"). In her testament of 9 June 1939 she wrote: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I beg the Lord to take my life and my death \u2026 for all concerns of the sacred hearts of Jesus and Mary and the holy church, especially for the preservation of our holy order, in particular the Carmelite monasteries of Cologne and Echt, as atonement for the unbelief of the Jewish People, and that the Lord will be received by his own people and his kingdom shall come in glory, for the salvation of Germany and the peace of the world, at last for my loved ones, living or dead, and for all God gave to me: that none of them shall go astray.\nStein's move to Echt prompted her to be more devout and even more observant of the Carmelite rule. After having her teaching position revoked by the implementation of the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, Stein quickly eased back into the role of instructor at the convent in Echt, teaching both fellow sisters and students within the community Latin and philosophy.\nEven prior to the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, Stein believed that she would not survive the war, going so far as to write to the prioress to request her permission to \"allow [Stein] to offer [her]self to the heart of Jesus as a sacrifice of atonement for true peace\" and she also wrote a will. Her fellow sisters would later recount how Stein began \"quietly training herself for life in a concentration camp, by enduring cold and hunger\" after the Nazi invasion of the Netherlands in May 1940.\nUltimately, she would not be safe in the Netherlands. The Dutch Bishops' Conference had a public statement condemning Nazi racism read in all churches across the nation on 20 July 1942. In a retaliatory response on 26 July 1942 the Reichskommissar of the Netherlands, Arthur Seyss-Inquart, ordered the arrest of all Jewish converts who had previously been spared. Along with two hundred and forty-three baptized Jews who were living in the Netherlands, Teresa Benedicta a Cruce was arrested by the SS on 2 August 1942. She and her sister Rosa were imprisoned at the concentration camps of Amersfoort and Westerbork before they were deported to Auschwitz. A Dutch official at Westerbork was so impressed by her sense of faith and her calm disposition, so he offered her an escape plan. Stein vehemently refused his assistance, stating: \"If somebody intervened at this point and took away [her] chance to share in the fate of [her] brothers and sisters, that would be utter annihilation.\"\nOn 7 August 1942, early in the morning, 987 Jews were deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp. It was probably on 9 August that Teresa Benedicta of the Cross, her sister Rosa, and many more Jewish people were killed in a gas chamber at Birkenau.\nPhilosophy.\nStein's development as a philosopher is frequently divided into three periods: an early, phenomenological (1916\u201325), a middle, comparative (1925\u201333) and a late, Christian (1935\u201342). In reality the same factors work themselves out throughout her work and propels it forward: 1. a profound understanding of and commitment to the phenomenological method as taught by Husserl and Reinach; 2. a deep sense of responsibility to the other for what we believe and 3. an acceptance of my own inability to form a complete, meaningful worldview without divine assistance. The three periods are best understood as stages of integration of these three factors, with Stein's baptism New Year's Day 1922, marking a decisive step on the way and her entering Carmel 14 October 1933 marking another.\nThe early phenomenological period (1916\u201325).\nStein's dissertation on empathy was according to her own account an attempt to fill a gap in Husserl's work. In her autobiographical \"Life in a Jewish Family\", she recalled that he took empathy to be the crucial act in which intersubjectivity was established, but nowhere detailed exactly what was meant by it. She therefore wanted to undertake this task and thereby clarify this crucial idea for the development of the phenomenological movement. While working as Husserl's assistant (1916\u201318) she edited Husserl's manuscripts of what was later to be published as \"Ideas II\" and \"III\", and in the process came to understand the extraordinary importance this act has for our constitution of the intersubjective world, and in particular for the objects studied by psychology and the humanities. When she resigned from her position as Husserl's assistant, the first work she undertook was on the phenomenological constitution of those objects: the psyche and the spirit. The result was the two treatises of \"Philosophy of Psychology and the Humanities\", published in Husserl's \"Jahrbuch\" 1922: \"Psychic Causality\" and \"Individual and Community\". From this period also dates \"Introduction to Philosophy,\" \"An Investigation Concerning the State,\" and very importantly \"Freedom and Grace\".\nThe middle comparative period (1925\u201333).\nEncouraged to study and compare Thomas Aquinas' philosophy with that of the phenomenological movement, Stein embarked on a translation project of Aquinas' \"De Veritate\", which was to be published in two volumes in 1932. The work, which translates Aquinas' way of thinking into a modern German idiom and restyles it as a contemporary academic treatise, occasioned that Stein engaged with Aquinas' thought as a phenomenologist, i.e. as someone interested in the matters discussed by Aquinas, as distinct from providing an interpretation of Aquinas' thought or writing in prolongation of it as a thomist. The most important works from this period are 'Husserl and Aquinas: A Comparison', in which she discusses the differing methodologies of Husserl and Aquinas and accounts for their differences, \"Potency and Act\", in which she attempts a phenomenological investigation of 'potency' and 'act' and the twin work of anthropology: The \"Structure of the Human Person\". \"Philosophical Anthropology\" and \"What is the Human Being?\" \"Theological Anthropology\" (the second volume remains a highly developed draft rather than a completed work, since Stein's lectures were canceled in 1933). During this period she also lectures on women's education and vocation and on education in general to very large audiences and to great acclaim. In these lectures, published in ESGA 13 and ESGA 16, she works out for herself the important questions concerning social type and essence, which find a fuller development in \"The Structure of the Human Person\".\nThe later Christian period (1934\u201342).\nHer first literal assignment in Carmel was to prepare \"Potency and Act\" for publication, a task she accomplished by writing a new book: \"Finite and Eternal Being \u2013 An Ascent to the Meaning of Being\". This work proposed a phenomenological doctrine of being \"(Seinslehre)\", which knows itself to be Christian, i.e. as taking Christian Revelation to contribute towards the view of the world in which it looks for and finds the meaning of being in being's unfolding. Stein also worked on Dionysius the Areopagite, translating his works into German and writing (for him) a work supposed to be lost on symbolic theology. Stein's final work, the \"Science of the Cross\", was a commentary on John of the Cross, which developed the specifically Carmelite understanding of the depths of the soul, already of interest to Stein in her early work.\nLegacy and veneration.\nTeresa Benedicta of the Cross was beatified as a martyr on 1 May 1987 in Cologne, Germany, by Pope John Paul II and then canonized by him 11 years later on 11 October 1998 in Rome. The miracle that was the basis for her canonization is the cure of Benedicta McCarthy, a little girl who had swallowed a large amount of paracetamol (acetaminophen), which causes hepatic necrosis. The young girl's father, Emmanuel Charles McCarthy, a priest of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, immediately called together relatives and prayed for Teresa's intercession. Shortly thereafter, the nurses in the intensive care unit saw her sit up, completely healthy. Ronald Kleinman, a pediatric specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who treated the girl, testified about her recovery to church tribunals, stating: \"I was willing to say that it was miraculous.\" McCarthy would later attend Sr. Teresa Benedicta's canonization.\nTeresa Benedicta of the Cross is one of the six patron saints of Europe, together with Benedict of Nursia, Cyril and Methodius, Bridget of Sweden, and Catherine of Siena.\nToday there are many schools named in tribute to her, for example in her hometown, Lubliniec, Poland Darmstadt, Germany, Hengelo, Netherlands, and Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. Also named for her are a women's dormitory at the University of T\u00fcbingen and a classroom building at The College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts.\nLubliniec in Poland hosts the Edith Stein Museum (Muzeum Pro Memoria Edith Stein) localised on the first floor of the Courant family house (Edith Stein's grandparents' family home). Wroc\u0142aw hosts a museum called Edith Stein House localised in the house Edith's mother bought for the family in 1919 on the street then called Michaelisstrasse 38 (today Nowowiejska 38).\nIn Vienna, the Edith-Stein-Haus at Ebendorferstra\u00dfe 8 is the main location of the Catholic University Chaplaincy and the university pastoral care of the Archdiocese of Vienna. In the spirit of Karl Strobl's model of the \"Catholic Student House\", the house is also home to a chapel consecrated to Edith Stein as well as a dormitory for about 90 students.\nThe philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre published a book in 2006 titled \"Edith Stein: A Philosophical Prologue, 1913\u20131922\", in which he contrasted her living of her own personal philosophy with Martin Heidegger, whose actions during the Nazi era, according to MacIntyre, suggested a \"bifurcation of personality.\"\nPlaywright Arthur Giron wrote \"Edith Stein\", a play that was inspired by Stein's life. It was produced at the Pittsburgh Public Theater in 1988.\nIn 1988, Edith Stein was pictured on a German postage stamp with Rupert Mayer SJ in honor of their beatification.\nIn 1991, the Italian musician Juri Camisasca released a song inspired by the life of Edith Stein, \"Il carmelo di Echt\" (The carmelite convent of Echt) on the album of the same name. The song was later recorded by Giuni Russo and Franco Battiato.\nIn 1995, Hungarian film director M\u00e1rta M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros made a movie about the life and death of Edith Stein with the title \"A hetedik szoba\" (The Seventh Room/Chamber), starring Maia Morgenstern.\nIn 1999, a memorial statue by German sculptor Bert Gerresheim was dedicated in Cologne, Germany. The statue comprises three different views of Stein reflecting her Jewish and Christian faith, and a pile of empty shoes representing the victims of the holocaust.\nIn 2007, Stein's life and work was dramatised in the novel \"Winter Under Water\" (Picador, London) by author James Hopkin.\nIn 2008, the first \"Stolperstein\" () that was ever laid in Poland was placed near Edith Stein's childhood home at 38 ul. Nowowiejska (formerly the Michaelisstra\u00dfe) in Wroc\u0142aw. Other \"Stolpersteine\" for her are in Cologne (several) and Freiburg.\nIn 2009, her bust was installed at the Walhalla Memorial near Regensburg, Germany. In June 2009, the International Association for the Study of the Philosophy of Edith Stein (IASPES) was founded, and held its first international conference at Maynooth University, Ireland, in order to advance the philosophical writings of Stein.\nOn 6 June 2014, the 70th anniversary of D-Day, a bell dedicated to her was named by Prince Charles at Bayeux Cathedral.\nAlso in 2014, the book \"Edith Stein and Regina Jonas: Religious Visionaries in the Time of the Death Camps\", by Emily Leah Silverman, was published.\nIn 2018, American film director Joshua Sinclair made a movie about the life and death of Edith Stein with the title \"A Rose in Winter\", starring Zana Marjanovic.\nIn April 2024, during a private audience Pope Francis received a formal request from the superior general of the Discalced Carmelites, Miguel M\u00e1rquez Calle, to declare Stein a Doctor of the Church. The Discalced Carmelites had first launched an international commission to gather the necessary documentation required for the declaration in 2022, in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of Stein's conversion to Catholicism and the 80th anniversary of her martyrdom.\nControversy as to the cause of her murder.\nThe beatification of Teresa Benedicta as a martyr generated criticism. Critics argued that she was murdered because she had Jew blood since she was Jewish by birth, rather than for her Christian faith, and they also argued that, in the words of Daniel Polish, the beatification seemed to \"carry the tacit message encouraging conversionary activities\" because \"official discussion of the beatification seemed to make a point of conjoining Stein's Catholic faith with her death with 'fellow Jews' in Auschwitz.\" The position of the Catholic Church is that Teresa Benedicta also died because of the Dutch episcopacy's public condemnation of Nazi racism in 1942; in other words, she died because of the moral teaching of the Church and thus, she is a true martyr.\nBibliography.\nFor a detailed chronology of Stein's writings see http://.\nContemporary critical edition.\n(\"Edith Stein Gesamtausgabe\", Herder 2000\u20132020) with English and Polish translations available\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the founder and chief executive officer of Electronic Data Systems and Perot Systems. He ran an independent campaign in the 1992 U.S. presidential election and a third-party campaign in the 1996 U.S. presidential election as the nominee of the Reform Party, which was formed by grassroots supporters of Perot's 1992 campaign. Although he failed to carry a single state in either election, both campaigns were among the stronger presidential showings by a third party or independent candidate in U.S. history.\nBorn and raised in Texarkana, Texas, Perot became a salesman for IBM after serving in the United States Navy. In 1962, he founded Electronic Data Systems, a data processing service company. In 1984, General Motors bought a controlling interest in the company for $2.4\u00a0billion ($\u00a0billion in 2024). Perot established Perot Systems in 1988 and was an angel investor for NeXT, a computer company founded by Steve Jobs after he left Apple. Perot also became heavily involved in the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue, arguing that hundreds of American servicemen were left behind in Southeast Asia after the Vietnam War. During the presidency of George H. W. Bush, Perot became increasingly active in politics and strongly opposed both the Gulf War and the ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement.\nIn 1992, Perot announced his intention to run for president and advocated a balanced budget, an end to the outsourcing of jobs, and the enactment of electronic direct democracy. A June 1992 Gallup poll showed Perot leading a three-way race against President Bush and presumptive Democratic nominee Bill Clinton. Perot withdrew from the race in July, but re-entered the race in early October after he qualified for all 50 state ballots. He chose Admiral James Stockdale as his running mate and appeared in the 1992 debates with Bush and Clinton. In the election, Perot did not win any electoral votes, but won over 19.7\u00a0million votes for an 18.9% share of the popular vote. He won support from across the ideological and partisan spectrum, but performed best among self-described moderates. Perot ran for president again in 1996, establishing the Reform Party as a vehicle for his campaign. He won 8.4 percent of the popular vote against President Clinton and Republican nominee Bob Dole.\nPerot did not seek public office again after 1996. He endorsed Republican George W. Bush over Reform nominee Pat Buchanan in the 2000 election and supported Republican Mitt Romney in 2008 and 2012. In 2009, Dell acquired Perot Systems for $3.9\u00a0billion ($\u00a0billion in 2024). According to \"Forbes\", Perot was the 167th richest person in the United States as of 2016. Perot died from leukemia in Dallas, Texas, on July 9, 2019. He was 89 years old.\nEarly life, education, and military career.\nHenry Ross Perot was born in Texarkana, Texas on June 27, 1930, the son of Lula May (n\u00e9e Ray) and Gabriel Ross Perot, a commodity broker specializing in cotton contracts. He had an older brother, Gabriel Perot Jr., who died as a toddler. His patrilineal line traces back to a French-Canadian immigrant to the colony of Louisiana in the 1740s.\nPerot attended a local private school, Patty Hill, before graduating from Texas High School in Texarkana in 1947. His first job, at eight years old, was helping to distribute the \"Texarkana Gazette\" as a paperboy. He joined the Boy Scouts of America and made Eagle Scout in 1942, after 13 months in the program, and was a recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award. One of Perot's childhood friends was Hayes McClerkin, who later became the Speaker of the Arkansas House of Representatives and a prominent lawyer in Texarkana, Arkansas.\nFrom 1947 to 1949, he attended Texarkana Junior College, then entered the United States Naval Academy in 1949 and helped establish its honor system. Perot claimed his appointment notice to the academy\u2014sent by telegram\u2014was sent by W. Lee \"Pappy\" O'Daniel, Texas's 34th governor and former senator. Perot served as a junior officer on a destroyer, and later, an aircraft carrier from 1953 to 1957. Perot, who had only ever owned one pair of shoes at a time, was shocked to find that he was issued multiple pairs of shoes in the navy, which he would later point to as \"possibly my first example of government waste\". Perot then went to the Naval Reserve, which he left on June 30, 1961, with the rank of lieutenant. His father died when Perot was 25 years old.\nIn 1956, Perot married Margot Birmingham, whom he met on a blind date as a midshipman docked in Baltimore.\nBusiness.\nAfter he left the Navy in 1957, Perot became a salesman for IBM. He quickly became a top employee (one year, he fulfilled his annual sales quota in two weeks) and tried to pitch his ideas to supervisors, who largely ignored him. He left IBM in 1962 to found Electronic Data Systems (EDS) in Dallas, Texas, and courted large corporations for his data processing services. Perot was denied bids for contracts 77 times before receiving his first contract. EDS received lucrative contracts from the US government in the 1960s, computerizing Medicare records. EDS went public in 1968, and the stock price rose from $16 a share to $160 within days. \"Fortune\" called Perot the \"fastest, richest Texan\" in a 1968 cover story. In December 1969, his shares in EDS were briefly worth $1 billion. Perot gained some press attention for being \"the biggest individual loser ever on the New York Stock Exchange\" when his EDS shares dropped $445\u00a0million ($\u00a0billion in today's money) in value in a single day in April 1970. While EDS boasted strong earnings in 1970, its exceptionally high price-to-earnings ratio, reaching 118 times earnings at its initial public offering in 1968, made it a prime target for a bear raid. The stock's vulnerability was compounded by the fact that a significant portion of the publicly traded shares were \"weakly held\" by fast-performance mutual funds prone to rapid selling at the first sign of trouble. When the stock price began to decline on April 22nd, likely due to large-scale short selling, these institutional investors quickly unloaded their holdings, triggering a panic sell-off and a precipitous drop in the share price. This dramatic single-day decline in EDS stock was part of a broader collapse in the technology sector during the second quarter of 1970. The average computer stock plummeted 80% from its peak in late 1968. University Computing, for instance, suffered a devastating 93% loss in value. The overall market downturn, reflected in a 19% drop in the S&amp;P 500 during that quarter, was further fueled by a recessionary environment, growing sociopolitical unrest related to the Vietnam War and events like the Kent State shootings, and a general loss of confidence in the market after a period of exuberant speculation. Coincidentally, the EDS crash occurred on the first Earth Day, adding to the symbolic significance of the event.\nIn 1984, General Motors bought a controlling interest in EDS for $2.4\u00a0billion ($\u00a0billion). In 1985, Perot sold EDS to General Motors with the idea that he and EDS would have a leadership role within the company. However, Perot's plan was ignored by the management of General Motors, prompting Perot to leave and later found Perot Systems. Perot's experience with GM contributed to him becoming an outspoken critic of corporate America. \nIn the same year, Perot became the second-richest man in the United States, only behind Sam Moore Walton, with a fortune estimated at $1.8\u00a0billion ($\u00a0billion), according to the Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest people in the United States.\nJust before the 1979 Iranian Revolution, the government of Iran imprisoned two EDS employees in a contract dispute. Perot organized and sponsored their rescue. The rescue team was led by retired United States Army Special Forces Colonel Arthur D. \"Bull\" Simons. When the team was unable to find a way to extract the two prisoners, they decided to wait for a group of revolutionaries to storm the jail and free all 10,000 inmates, many of whom were political prisoners. The two prisoners then connected with the rescue team, which led them out of Iran through a border crossing into Turkey. The exploit was recounted in the book \"On Wings of Eagles\" by Ken Follett. In 1986 this was turned into a two-part television mini-series (alternatively titled \"Teheran\") with the actor Burt Lancaster playing the role of Colonel Simons and Richard Crenna as Perot.\nIn 1984, Perot's Perot Foundation bought a very early copy of Magna Carta, one of only a few to leave the United Kingdom. The foundation lent it to the National Archives in Washington, D.C., where it was displayed alongside the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States. In 2007, the foundation sold it to David Rubenstein, managing director of The Carlyle Group for $21.3\u00a0million ($\u00a0million) to be used \"for medical research, for improving public education and for assisting wounded soldiers and their families\". It remains on display at the National Archives.\nAfter Steve Jobs lost the power struggle at Apple and left to found NeXT, his angel investor was Perot, who invested over $20\u00a0million. Perot believed in Jobs and did not want to miss out, as he had with his chance to invest in Bill Gates's fledgling Microsoft.\nIn 1988, he founded Perot Systems in Plano, Texas. His son, Ross Perot Jr., eventually succeeded him as CEO. In September 2009, Perot Systems was acquired by Dell for $3.9\u00a0billion ($\u00a0billion).\nPolitical activities.\nEarly political activities.\nAfter a visit to Laos in 1969, made at the request of the White House, in which he met with senior North Vietnamese officials, Perot became heavily involved in the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue. He believed that hundreds of American servicemen were left behind in Southeast Asia at the end of the U.S. involvement in the war, and that government officials were covering up POW/MIA investigations to avoid revealing a drug-smuggling operation used to finance a secret war in Laos. Perot engaged in unauthorized back-channel discussions with Vietnamese officials in the late 1980s, which led to fractured relations between Perot and the Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations. In 1990, Perot reached an agreement with Vietnam's Foreign Ministry to become its business agent if diplomatic relations were normalized. Perot also launched private investigations of, and attacks upon, United States Department of Defense official Richard Armitage.\nIn Florida in 1990, retired financial planner Jack Gargan, employing a famous quotation from the 1976 movie \"Network\", funded a series of \"I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore\" newspaper advertisements denouncing Congress for voting to give legislators pay raises at a time when average wages nationwide were not increasing. Gargan later founded \"Throw the Hypocritical Rascals Out\" (THRO), which Perot supported.\nPerot did not support President George H. W. Bush, and vigorously opposed the United States' involvement in the 1990\u20131991 Persian Gulf War. He unsuccessfully urged Senators to vote against the war resolution, and began to consider a presidential run.\n1992 presidential campaign.\nOn February 20, 1992, Perot appeared on CNN's \"Larry King Live\" and announced his intention to run as an independent if his supporters could get his name on the ballot in all 50 states. With such declared policies as balancing the federal budget, favoring certain types of gun control, ending the outsourcing of jobs and enacting electronic direct democracy via \"electronic town halls\", he became a potential candidate and soon polled roughly even with the two major-party candidates.\nPerot denounced Congress for its inaction in a speech at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., on March 18, 1992; he said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This city has become a town filled with sound bites, shell games, handlers, media stuntmen who posture, create images, talk, shoot off Roman candles, but don't ever accomplish anything. We need deeds, not words, in this city.\nPerot's candidacy received increasing media attention when the competitive phase of the primary season ended for the two major parties. With the insurgent candidacies of Republican Pat Buchanan and Democrat Jerry Brown winding down, Perot was the natural beneficiary of populist resentment toward establishment politicians. On May 25, 1992, he was featured on the cover of \"Time\" with the title \"Waiting for Perot\", an allusion to Samuel Beckett's play \"Waiting for Godot\".\nSeveral months before the Democratic and Republican conventions, Perot filled the vacuum of election news, as his supporters began petition drives to get him on the ballot in all 50 states. This sense of momentum was reinforced when Perot employed two savvy campaign managers in Democrat Hamilton Jordan and Republican Ed Rollins. While Perot was pondering whether to run for office, his supporters established a campaign organization United We Stand America. Perot was late in making formal policy proposals, but most of what he did call for was intended to reduce the deficit, such as a fuel tax increase and cutbacks to Social Security. In June, Perot led a Gallup poll with 39% of the vote.\nIn July, the Perot campaign fell into disarray and his polls fell sharply. The 1992 Democratic National Convention was held on Monday, July 13 through Thursday, July 16, during which time there was increased media coverage of the general election. \"The Milwaukee Sentinel\" reported that Perot's campaign managers were becoming increasingly disillusioned by Perot's unwillingness to follow their advice to be more specific on issues, and his need to be in full control of operations. The \"St. Petersburg Times\" reported such tactics as forcing volunteers to sign loyalty oaths. Perot's poll numbers had slipped to 25%, and his advisers warned that if he continued to ignore them, he would fall into single digits. Hamilton Jordan (a high-ranking manager in the Perot campaign) allegedly threatened to quit, but senior campaign officials denied this.\nOn July 15, Ed Rollins resigned after Perot fired advertisement specialist Hal Riney, who had worked with Rollins on the Reagan campaign. Rollins would later claim that a member of the campaign accused him of being a Bush plant with ties to the Central Intelligence Agency. Amid the chaos, Perot's support fell to 20%. The next day, Perot announced on \"Larry King Live\" that he would not seek the presidency. He explained that he did not want the House of Representatives to decide the election if the result caused the electoral college to be split. Perot eventually stated the reason was that he received threats that digitally altered photographs would be released by the Bush campaign to sabotage his daughter's wedding. Whatever his reasons for withdrawing, his reputation was badly damaged. Many of his supporters felt betrayed, and public opinion polls subsequently showed a largely negative view of Perot that was absent before his decision to end the campaign.\nIn September, he qualified for all 50 state ballots. On October 1, he announced his intention to re-enter the presidential race. He campaigned in 16 states and spent an estimated $12.3\u00a0million of his own money. Perot employed the innovative strategy of purchasing half-hour blocks of time on major networks for infomercial-type campaign advertisements; this advertising garnered more viewership than many sitcoms, with one Friday night program in October attracting 10.5\u00a0million viewers.\nAt one point in June, Perot led the polls with 39% (versus 31% for Bush and 25% for Clinton). Just prior to the debates, Perot received 7\u20139% support in nationwide polls. The debates likely played a significant role in his ultimate receipt of almost 19% of the popular vote. Although his answers during the debates were often general, Frank Newport of Gallup concluded that Perot \"convincingly won the first debate, coming in significantly ahead of both the Democratic challenger Clinton and incumbent President George H.W. Bush\". In the debate, he remarked:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Keep in mind our Constitution predates the Industrial Revolution. Our founders did not know about electricity, the train, telephones, radio, television, automobiles, airplanes, rockets, nuclear weapons, satellites, or space exploration. There's a lot they didn't know about. It would be interesting to see what kind of document they'd draft today. Just keeping it frozen in time won't hack it.\nIn the 1992 election, he received 18.9% of the popular vote, about 19,741,065 votes, but no electoral college votes, making him the most successful non-major-party presidential candidate in terms of share of the popular vote since Theodore Roosevelt in the 1912 election. Unlike Perot, however, multiple third-party candidates since Roosevelt had won electoral college votes: Robert La Follette in 1924, Strom Thurmond in 1948, and George Wallace in 1968. Compared with Thurmond and Wallace, who polled very strongly in a small number of states, Perot's vote was more evenly spread across the country. Perot managed to finish second in two states: in Maine, Perot received 30.44% of the vote\u2014ahead of part-time resident Bush's 30.39% (Clinton won Maine with 38.77%); and in Utah, Perot received 27.34% of the vote\u2014ahead of Clinton's 24.65% (Bush won Utah with 43.36%). Although Perot did not win a state, he received a plurality of votes in some counties. His popular vote total is still by far the most ever garnered for a non-major-party candidate, almost double the previous record set by Wallace in 1968.\nA detailed analysis of voting demographics revealed that Perot's support drew heavily from across the political spectrum, with 20% of his votes coming from self-described liberals, 27% from self-described conservatives, and 53% coming from self-described moderates. Economically, however, the majority of Perot voters (57%) were middle class, earning between $15,000 and $49,000 annually, with the bulk of the remainder drawing from the upper-middle class (29% earning more than $50,000 annually). Exit polls also showed that 38% of Perot voters would have otherwise voted for Bush, and 38% would have voted for Clinton. Though there were widespread claims that Perot acted as a \"spoiler\", post-election analysis suggested that his presence in the race likely did not affect the outcome. According to Seymour Martin Lipset, the 1992 election had several unique characteristics. Voters felt that economic conditions were worse than they actually were, which harmed Bush. A strong third-party candidate was a rare event. Liberals launched a backlash against 12 years of a conservative White House. The chief factor was Clinton's uniting his party, and winning over a number of heterogeneous groups. In 2016, FiveThirtyEight described the theory that Perot was a spoiler as \"unlikely\".\nBased on his performance in the popular vote in 1992, Perot was entitled to receive federal election funding for 1996. Perot remained in the public eye after the election and championed opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). During the campaign, he had urged voters to listen for the \"giant sucking sound\" of American jobs heading south to Mexico should NAFTA be ratified.\n1996 presidential campaign.\nPerot tried to keep his movement alive through the mid-1990s, continuing to speak about the increasing national debt. He was a prominent campaigner against NAFTA, and frequently claimed that American manufacturing jobs would go to Mexico. On November 10, 1993, Perot debated with then-Vice President Al Gore on the issue on \"Larry King Live\" with an audience of 16 million viewers. Perot's behavior during the debate was a source of mirth thereafter, including his repeated pleas to \"let me finish\" in his southern drawl. The debate was seen by many as effectively ending Perot's political career. Support for NAFTA went from 34% to 57%.\nIn 1995, he founded the Reform Party, which focused on fiscal conservatism and electoral reform, and won their presidential nomination for the 1996 United States presidential election. His vice presidential running mate was Pat Choate. Because of the ballot access laws, he had to run as an independent on many state ballots. Perot received 8% of the popular vote in 1996, lower than in the 1992 race, but still an unusually successful third-party showing by U.S. standards. He spent much less of his own money in this race than he had four years prior, and he also allowed other people to contribute to his campaign, unlike his prior race. One common explanation for the decline was Perot's exclusion from the presidential debates, based on the preferences of the Democratic and Republican party candidates. Law professor Jamie Raskin filed a lawsuit over Perot's exclusion years later.\nLater activities.\nIn the 2000 presidential election, Perot refused to become openly involved with the internal Reform Party dispute between supporters of Pat Buchanan and John Hagelin. Perot was reportedly unhappy with what he saw as the disintegration of the party, as well as his own portrayal in the press; thus, he chose to remain quiet. He appeared on \"Larry King Live\" four days before the election and endorsed George W. Bush for president. Despite his earlier opposition to NAFTA, Perot remained largely silent about expanded use of guest-worker visas in the United States, with Buchanan supporters attributing this silence to his corporate reliance on foreign workers.\nIn 2005, Perot was asked to testify before the Texas Legislature in support of proposals to extend access to technology to students, including making laptops available to them. He supported changing the process of buying textbooks by making e-books available and by allowing schools to purchase books at the local level instead of going through the state. In an April 2005 interview, Perot expressed concern about the state of progress on issues that he had raised in his presidential runs.\nIn January 2008, Perot publicly came out against Republican candidate John McCain and endorsed Mitt Romney for president. He also announced that he would soon be launching a new website with updated economic graphs and charts. In June 2008, his blog launched, focusing on entitlements (Medicare, Medicaid, Social security), the U.S. national debt, and related issues. In 2012, Perot endorsed Romney for president again. Perot did not give any endorsements for the 2016 election.\nPolitical views.\nPerot did not fit the usual political stereotypes; his views were seen as either pragmatic or populist, depending on the observer, and usually focused on his economic policy, such as balancing the budget, to gain support from both Democratic and Republican voters. Perot supported stricter gun control such as an assault weapons ban and supported increased research in AIDS. Perot was hesitant on covering the issue of gay rights during his 1992 campaign, but openly supported gay rights in 1996. \nPerot spoke in favor of \"comprehensive national health care plan \u2014 one that would be akin to Medicare but for all Americans, not just the needy\". He also became known for his opposition to NAFTA; Perot believed that the power of corporations must be curbed, and saw the transfer of jobs to other countries as a symbol of corruption and inequality. He argued that such trade agreements only benefited the companies while robbing the US of its tax base and blue-collar jobs. Perot famously stated during the October 15 debate that NAFTA would create a \"giant sucking sound\" on American jobs.\nThe populism of Ross Perot is hard to define and is a contested topic amongst political scientists. Perot was described as a \"classical populist\", liberal populist, \"telepopulist\" and also a \"third way\" populist. Neal Allen and Brian J. Brox argue that Perot was neither left nor right-wing ideologically, and focused first and foremost on promoting reforms of the political process and grassroots democracy; despite this, they also found some notable similarities between Perot and the left-wing populism of Ralph Nader, and an average Perot voter had liberal leanings. \nAnton Pelinka described Perot's ideology as the \"populism of the centre\", presenting a distinct form of populism that significantly differed from left-wing and right-wing populist movements that appeared in the USA. Matthijs Rooduijn argues that Perot was an example of a liberal populist with centre-left leanings, noting his hostility to Reaganomics - in the 1992 election, Perot stated that USA was in crisis caused by \"the decade of greed, the era of trickle-down economics\". In his famous \"The Populist Explosion: How the Great Recession Transformed American and European Politics\" publication, John Judis wrote that \"Perot represented a left and center-left populism\", in tradition of the Populist Party and Huey Long. According to Judis, Perot \"represented the first clear repudiation of the neoliberal agenda.\"\nRegarding foreign policy, Perot was an outspoken opponent of the Gulf War and condemned Bush for the military intervention against Iraq. He instead promoted a more isolationist foreign policy, arguing that USA should focus on rebuilding its economy. In his 1992 presidential campaign, Perot stated that his \"highest foreign policy priority is to get our house in order and make America work again\". He attacked Bush for his ties to Saddam Hussein prior to the invasion of Kuwait - according to Perot, the Bush administration covertly aided Hussein's chemical weapons programs and turned a blind eye to Iraqi plans against Kuwait, instructing April Glaspie to greenlight Hussein's invasion on assumption that he would only seize Kuwait's northern oil fields. Perot claimed that Bush invaded Iraq because its actions threatened Bush's \"manhood\", and stated: \"off we go into the wild blue yonder with the lives of our servicemen at risk because of 10 years of stupid mistakes\".\nPerot also focused on anti-lobbying and political reform proposals - he favored a presidential line item veto against \"pork barrel spending and waste\", elimination of political action committees (PACs) to curb the influence of special interest groups, replacement of the Gramm\u2013Rudman\u2013Hollings Balanced Budget Act with a different balanced budget apparatus that would focus on limiting \"tricks, loopholes, and improper accounting procedures\" and a ban on exit polling during elections. He also postulated a ban on lobbying.\nFrom 1992, Perot was a pro-choice activist, and a strong supporter of Planned Parenthood. He stated that poorer women in particular should have access to abortions via federal funding. From 2000, he was pro-choice reluctantly.\nEconomic policy.\nPerot believed taxes should be increased on the wealthy, while spending should be cut to help pay off the national debt. Perot also believed the capital gains tax should be increased, while giving tax breaks to those starting new businesses.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"We cut the capital gains tax rate from a maximum rate of 35% to a maximum rate that got as low as 20% during the 1980s. Who got the benefit? The rich did, of course, because that's who owns most of the capital assets.\"\u2014\u200a\nTogether with increased taxes on the wealthy, Perot also supported curbing entitlement payments and tax rebates to the affluent, and spoke in favor of eliminating the government's air fleet and other Washington perks for legislators, mocking the privileges that the US legislators enjoyed. He also argued that the government should protect the job base through intervention in the market. He spoke in support of creating a national industrial ministry based on the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which would increase state control over large businesses and direct their investment. Perot stressed that the government should ensure that both public and private investments would target the \"industries of the future\". When asked about objections to his plans from free-market advocates, Perot said: \"Don\u2019t they realize that the biogenetics industry is the result\nof our federally funded research universities and the National Institutes of Health?\"\nPerot was strongly opposed to neoliberalism, and was credited with marking the \"first clear repudiation\" of the neoliberal economic policies pursued by Ronald Reagan: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"A disturbing trend has emerged from the decade of greed, the era of trickle-down economics and the period of capital gains tax manipulation. We are headed for a two-class society.\"\u2014\u200a\nIn his 1993 book \"Not For Sale at Any Price\", Perot expressed support for giving tax cuts for small and medium-sized enterprises, as opposed to larger corporations. Additionally, Perot supported a balanced budget amendment, stating, \"spending should not exceed revenue for 27 consecutive years.\" On trade, Perot stated that NAFTA caused the trade deficit between Mexico and the United States and a loss of manufacturing jobs. His position on free trade and NAFTA became his defining campaign principle of both the 1992 and 1996 presidential elections. Perot argued: \"We have got to stop sending jobs overseas. It's pretty simple: If you're paying $12, $13, $14 an hour for factory workers and you can move your factory south of the border, pay a dollar an hour for labor, ...\u00a0have no health care\u2014that's the most expensive single element in making a car\u2014have no environmental controls, no pollution controls and no retirement, and you don't care about anything but making money, there will be a giant sucking sound going south.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... when [Mexico's] jobs come up from a dollar an hour to six dollars an hour, and ours go down to six dollars an hour, and then it's leveled again. But in the meantime, you've wrecked the country with these kinds of deals.\u2014\u200a\nFor the 1992 election, Perot unveiled an ambitious budget program that would balance the budget through redistributive policies. The most prominent element of the plan was Perot's proposal to raise the income tax bracket of 4% wealthiest households from 31 to 33 percent, and to raise it further to 35 percent in the future. Other points included increasing the taxable portion of Social Security benefits from 50 to 85 percent for recipients with income of $25,000 or more, as well as implementing a tax on hitherto tax-free employer-paid health insurance, with Perot arguing that a tax-free workplace insurance creates an unfair advantage for those who receive health insurance through their job. The plan also called for doubling cigarette tax and increasing gasoline tax by 50 cents a gallon. Perot explained that higher gasoline tax would help conserve energy and reduce pollution. He also advocated the creation of a special allowance for the workers disproportionately affected by the higher gasoline price. The plan also included massive cuts in military spending and scrapping the proposed space station project, which Perot derided as \"a vacation home in space\".\nPersonal life and death.\nPerot and his wife Margot (n\u00e9e Birmingham; born November 15, 1933), a graduate of Goucher College, had five children including Ross Jr., and 19 grandchildren.\nPerot was raised in the Methodist faith. However, he converted to Presbyterianism and became a member of the Highland Park Presbyterian Church in the late 1960s. Perot was described as very faithful in church attendance.\nPerot died from leukemia in Dallas, Texas, on July 9, 2019, less than two weeks after his 89th birthday. At the time of his death, he had an estimated net worth of about $4.1\u00a0billion ($\u00a0billion in 2024), and was ranked by \"Forbes\" as the 167th-richest person in the United States. He is buried at the Sparkman-Hillcrest Memorial Park Cemetery; a memorial service was held at Highland Park United Methodist Church, with 1,300 guests."}
{"id": "43506", "revid": "16849003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43506", "title": "Axis of evil", "text": "American term for \"sponsors of terrorism\"\nThe phrase \"axis of evil\" was first used by U.S. president George W. Bush and originally referred to Iran, Ba'athist Iraq, and North Korea. It was used in Bush's State of the Union address on January 29, 2002, less than five months after the September 11 attacks and more than a year before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and often repeated throughout his presidency. He used it to describe foreign governments that, during his administration, allegedly sponsored terrorism and sought weapons of mass destruction.\nThe countries originally covered by the term were Iran, Ba'athist Iraq, and North Korea. In response, Iran formed a political alliance that it called the \"Axis of Resistance\" comprising Iran, Ba'athist Syria and Hezbollah.\nLater, China, Russia, Iran and North Korea were referred to as the \"new axis of evil\" by U.S. politicians and commentators. The term \"axis of evil\" is a reference to the Axis powers of World War II (Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and the Empire of Japan).\nOrigins.\nDavid Frum.\nThe phrase was attributed to former Bush pro-Israel speechwriter David Frum, originally as the \"axis of hatred\" and then \"evil\". Information about his authorship first came out when emails of Frum's wife to friends were picked up by the media. Frum explained his rationale for creating the phrase \"axis of evil\" in his 2003 book \"The Right Man: The Surprise Presidency of George W. Bush.\" According to Frum, in late December 2001 head speechwriter Michael Gerson gave him the assignment of articulating the case for dislodging the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq in only a few sentences for the upcoming State of the Union address. Frum says he began by rereading President Franklin D. Roosevelt's \"date which will live in infamy\" speech given on December 8, 1941, after the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. While Americans needed no convincing about going to war with Japan, Roosevelt saw the greater threat to the United States coming from Nazi Germany, and he had to make the case for fighting a two-ocean war.\nFrum points in his book to a now often-overlooked sentence in Roosevelt's speech which reads in part, \"...we will not only defend ourselves to the uttermost but will make very certain that this form of treachery shall never endanger us again.\" Frum interprets Roosevelt's oratory like this: \"For FDR, Pearl Harbor was not only an attack\u2014it was a warning of future and worse attacks from another, even more dangerous enemy.\" Japan, a country with one-tenth of America's industrial capacity, a dependence on imports for its food, and already engaged in a war with China, was extremely reckless to attack the United States, a recklessness \"that made the Axis such a menace to world peace\", Frum says. Saddam Hussein's two wars, against Iran and Kuwait, were just as reckless, Frum decided, and therefore presented the same threat to world peace.\nIn his book Frum relates that the more he compared the Axis powers of World War II to modern \"terror states\", the more similarities he saw. \"The Axis powers disliked and distrusted one another\", Frum writes. \"Had the Axis somehow won the war, its members would quickly have turned on one another.\" Iran, Iraq, al-Qaeda, and Hezbollah, despite quarreling among themselves, \"all resented power of the West and Israel, and they all despised the humane values of democracy.\" There, Frum saw the connection: \"Together, the terror states and the terror organizations formed an axis of hatred against the United States.\"\nFrum tells that he then sent off a memo with the above arguments and also cited some of the atrocities perpetrated by the Iraqi government. He expected his words to be chopped apart and altered beyond recognition, as is the fate of much presidential speechwriting, but his words were ultimately read by Bush nearly verbatim, though Bush changed the term \"axis of hatred\" to \"axis of evil\". North Korea was added to the list, he says, because it was attempting to develop nuclear weapons, had a history of reckless aggression, and \"needed to feel a stronger hand\".\nYossef Bodansky.\nA decade before the 2002 State of the Union address, in August 1992, the Israeli-American political scientist Yossef Bodansky wrote a paper entitled \"Tehran, Baghdad &amp; Damascus: The New Axis Pact\" while serving as the Director of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare of the US House of Representatives. Although he did not explicitly apply the epithet \"evil\" to his New Axis, Bodansky's axis was otherwise very reminiscent of Frum's axis. Bodansky felt that this new Axis was a very dangerous development. The gist of Bodansky's argument was that Iran, Iraq and Syria had formed a \"tripartite alliance\" in the wake of the First Gulf War, and that this alliance posed an imminent threat that could only be dealt with by invading Iraq a second time and overthrowing Saddam Hussein.\n2002 State of the Union Address.\nIn his 2002 State of the Union Address, Bush called North Korea \"A regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction, while starving its citizens.\" He also stated Iran \"aggressively pursues these weapons and exports terror, while an unelected few repress the Iranian people's hope for freedom.\" Bush gave the most criticism to Iraq, stating \"Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support terror. The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax and nerve gas and nuclear weapons for over a decade. This is a regime that has already used poison gas to murder thousands of its own citizens, leaving the bodies of mothers huddled over their dead children. This is a regime that agreed to international inspections, then kicked out the inspectors. This is a regime that has something to hide from the civilized world.\" Afterwards, Bush said, \"States like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world.\"\nBolton: \"Beyond the Axis of Evil\".\nOn May 6, 2002, then-Undersecretary of State John Bolton gave a speech entitled \"Beyond the Axis of Evil\". In it he added three more nations to be grouped with the already mentioned rogue states: Cuba, Libya, and Syria. The criteria for inclusion in this grouping were: \"state sponsors of terrorism that are pursuing or who have the potential to pursue weapons of mass destruction (WMD) or have the capability to do so in violation of their treaty obligations.\"\nChina, Russia, Iran, North Korea new axis.\nIn February 2022, American conservative political commentator Danielle Pletka called China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea as the \"new\" axis of evil in an article for the \"National Review\". Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the \"Taipei Times\" published an editorial calling the alliance between the Russia and China \"the real axis of evil\".\nIn October 2023, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell told CBS' \"Face The Nation\" that Iran, North Korea, Russia, and China are the new \"axis of evil. The Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson echoed a very similar comment on Fox News' \"Hannity\".\nIn October 2023, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described an axis of evil involving Hamas and Iran in an op-ed in \"The Wall Street Journal\".\nIn January 2024, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and his predecessor, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, cautioned about the formation of a new axis of autocracies led by China, but joined by Russia, Iran and North Korea. The same states have been recognized as a new axis of evil by several American politicians, including Christopher Cavoli, Mike Johnson, and Mitch McConnell.\nOn April 17, 2024, GOP U.S. speaker of the house Mike Johnson referred to China as part of \"the axis of evil\" that also includes Iran and Russia. Johnson based his statement on the belief that the countries pose threats the western-aligned countries of Taiwan, Israel, and Ukraine. This preceded a change of tact, where the speaker decided to support $95 billion of defence aid for the combined countries, despite the opposition of the more conservative members of his caucus.\nIn July 2024, British Army General Sir Patrick Sanders said that Russia, China and Iran were the \"new axis powers\" in an interview with The Times. He argued they posed more of a threat than Nazi Germany in 1939, stating \"They are more interdependent and more aligned than the original axis powers were\" and that the world is facing \"as dangerous a moment as any time that we've had since 1945\". On July 23, newly appointed Army chief General Sir Roland Walker said in a speech that the UK faced danger from an \"axis of upheaval\" with threats from an angered Russia, that China was intent on retaking Taiwan, and that Iran was likely to pursue nuclear weapons.\nCriticism.\nIran and Iraq fought the long Iran\u2013Iraq War in the 1980s under basically the same leadership as that which existed at the time of Bush's speech, leading some to believe that the linking of the nations under the same banner was misguided. Others argued that each of the three nations in the \"axis of evil\" had some special characteristics which were obscured by grouping them together. Anne Applebaum wrote about the debate over North Korea's inclusion in the group.\nIn the days after the September 11 attacks, Ryan Crocker \u2014 who would later become the United States ambassador to Iraq from 2007 to 2009 \u2014 and other senior U.S. State Department officials flew to Geneva to meet secretly with representatives of the government of Iran. For several months, Crocker and his Iranian counterparts cooperated on capturing Al Qaeda operatives in the region and fighting the Taliban government in Afghanistan. These meetings stopped after the \"Axis of Evil\" speech hardened Iranian attitudes toward cooperating with the U.S.\nAlso, immediately after the attacks, the Iranian President Mohammad Khatami\u2014in a message to the American people\u2014showed sympathy with the victims and the Iranian people took to mosques and streets to pray and show their condolences. None of the terrorists involved in 9/11 were citizens of the three nations Bush cited.\nOther axes.\nIn January 2006, Israeli Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz implicated \"the axis of terror that operates between Iran and Syria\" following a suicide bomb in Tel Aviv.\nIn April 2006 the phrase \"axis of terror\" earned more publicity. Israel's UN Ambassador, Dan Gillerman, cautioned of a new \"axis of terror\"\u2014Iran, Syria and the Hamas-run Palestinian government; Gillerman repeated the term before the UN over the crisis in Lebanon. Some three months later Israeli senior foreign ministry official Gideon Meir branded the alleged alliance an \"axis of terror and hate\".\nIn 2006, Isaias Afewerki, the president of Eritrea, had declared in response to the deteriorating relations with the neighboring countries of Ethiopia, Sudan and Yemen by accusing them of being an \"Axis of Belligerence.\"\nIn 2006, the former president of Venezuela, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, described the so-called New Latin Left as an \"axis of good\" which comprised Bolivia, Chile, Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Uruguay and Venezuela but described \"Washington and its allies\" as an \"axis of evil\".\nIn 2007, the commander of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps declared that the United States, the United Kingdom and Israel were part of an \"axis of evil\" alleging mass violence against the Islamic world, crimes against humanity and attempting to divide Shi'ites and Sunnis.\nIn 2008, \"The Economist\" featured an article about the \"Axis of Diesel\" in reference to a burgeoning alliance of Iran, Russia, and Venezuela. They cite the billions of dollars in arms sales to Venezuela and the construction of Iranian nuclear facilities as well as the rejection of added sanctions on Iran. They did conclude that the benefits of the arrangement were exaggerated, however.\nFrom 2010 onward, the term \"Axis of Resistance\" has been used to describe an anti-Western and anti-Israeli alliance between Iran, Syria, Hezbollah, Iraqi Shia militias, and the Houthis.\nIn 2012, author William C. Martel, in a short essay for \"The Diplomat\", wrote of an \"Authoritarian Axis\", comprising China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and Venezuela. Following the death of Venezuela's Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in 2013, Martel removed Venezuela from the assigned list of countries, in his subsequent writings about the \"axis\". Martel's thesis drew criticism from \"The American Conservative\" and \"Muslim Village\", with the main arguments cited in opposition to his idea being the lack of cohesion and generally low levels of cooperation shown between the cited countries.\nSeveral environmental non-governmental organizations, including Greenpeace and the Green Party of Canada, have dubbed Australia, Canada and United States, the \"Axis of Environmental Evil\" because of their lack of support for international environmental agreements, particularly those related to climate change.\nDuring a March 2018 interview with the Egyptian media, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman referred Iran, Turkey and Islamist organizations such as the Islamic State and the Muslim Brotherhood as the \"triangle of evil\", to describe their current policies in the Middle East. Those remarks were later dismissed by Iran, describing it as \"childish\" and said that Saudi Arabia's intervention in Yemen has \"caused instability and extremism and stuck in a quagmire\" in Yemen.\nIn October 2018, the economist Paul Krugman tweeted, \"[t]here's a new axis of evil: Russia, Saudi Arabia\u2014and the United States\", the three countries that declined to endorse the United Nation's latest climate study at the 2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference.\nMedia's use of the term.\nParodies.\nVarious related pun phrases include:\nThe term has also lent itself to various parodies, including the following:\nComedy tour.\nIn response to the problems which Americans of Middle-Eastern descent have in the current climate, a group of comedians have banded together to form the \"Axis of Evil Comedy Tour\". The comedians, Ahmed Ahmed (from Egypt), Maz Jobrani (from Iran), and Aron Kader (whose father is Palestinian), have created a show which aired on Comedy Central. They have also included half-Palestinian, half-Italian Dean Obeidallah in some of their acts.\nThe group took the comedy tour around the Middle East (November\u2013December 2007), performing in the UAE, Egypt, Kuwait, Jordan, and Lebanon to sell-out crowds.\nLullabies.\nIn 2003 the Norwegian record label Kirkelig Kulturverksted published the CD \"Lullabies from the Axis of Evil\" containing 14 lullabies from Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Palestine, Syria, Afghanistan and Cuba. Every lullaby is presented in its original form sung by women from these countries, and then a western version with interpretations in English.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its principal members were Nazi Germany, the Kingdom of Italy and the Empire of Japan. The Axis were united in their far-right positions and general opposition to the Allies, but otherwise lacked comparable coordination and ideological cohesion.\nThe Axis grew out of successive diplomatic efforts by Germany, Italy, and Japan to secure their own specific expansionist interests in the mid-1930s. The first step was the protocol signed by Germany and Italy in October 1936, after which Italian leader Benito Mussolini declared that all other European countries would thereafter rotate on the Rome\u2013Berlin axis, thus creating the term \"Axis\". The following November saw the ratification of the Anti-Comintern Pact, an anti-communist treaty between Germany and Japan; Italy joined the Pact in 1937, followed by Hungary and Spain in 1939. The \"Rome\u2013Berlin Axis\" became a military alliance in 1939 under the so-called \"Pact of Steel\", with the Tripartite Pact of 1940 formally integrating the military aims of Germany, Italy, Japan, and later followed by other nations. The three pacts formed the foundation of the Axis alliance.\nAt its zenith in 1942, the Axis presided over large parts of Europe, North Africa, and East Asia, either through occupation, annexation, or puppet states. In contrast to the Allies, there were no three-way summit meetings, and cooperation and coordination were minimal; on occasion, the interests of the major Axis powers were even at variance with each other. The Axis ultimately came to an end with its defeat in 1945.\nParticularly within Europe, the use of the term \"the Axis\" sometimes refers solely to the alliance between Italy and Germany, though outside Europe it is normally understood as including Japan.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOrigins and creation.\nThe term \"axis\" was first applied to the Italo-German relationship by the Italian prime minister Benito Mussolini in September 1923, when he wrote in the preface to Roberto Suster's \"La\" \"Germania Repubblicana\" that \"there is no doubt that in this moment the axis of European history passes through Berlin\" (\"non v'ha dubbio che in questo momento l'asse della storia europea passa per Berlino\"). At the time, he was seeking an alliance with the Weimar Republic against Yugoslavia and France in the dispute over the Free State of Fiume.\nThe term was used by Hungary's prime minister Gyula G\u00f6mb\u00f6s when advocating an alliance of Hungary with Germany and Italy in the early 1930s. G\u00f6mb\u00f6s' efforts did affect the Italo-Hungarian Rome Protocols, but his sudden death in 1936 while negotiating with Germany in Munich and the arrival of K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Dar\u00e1nyi, his successor, ended Hungary's involvement in pursuing a trilateral axis. Contentious negotiations between the Italian foreign minister, Galeazzo Ciano, and the German ambassador, Ulrich von Hassell, resulted in a Nine-Point Protocol, signed by Ciano and his German counterpart, Konstantin von Neurath, in 1936. When Mussolini publicly announced the signing on 1 November, he proclaimed the creation of a Rome\u2013Berlin axis.\nInitial proposals of a German\u2013Italian alliance.\nItaly under \"Duce\" Benito Mussolini had pursued a strategic alliance of Italy with Germany against France since the early 1920s. Prior to becoming head of government in Italy as leader of the Italian Fascist movement, Mussolini had advocated alliance with defeated Germany after the Paris Peace Conference (1919\u20131920) settled World War I. He believed that Italy could expand its influence in Europe by allying with Germany against France. In early 1923, as a goodwill gesture to Germany, Italy secretly delivered weapons for the \"Reichswehr\", which had faced major disarmament under the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles.\nSince the 1920s Italy had identified the year 1935 as a crucial date for preparing for a war against France, as 1935 was the year when Germany's obligations under the Treaty of Versailles were scheduled to expire. Meetings took place in Berlin in 1924 between Italian General Luigi Capello and prominent figures in the German military, such as von Seeckt and Erich Ludendorff, over military collaboration between Germany and Italy. The discussions concluded that Germans still wanted a war of revenge against France but were short on weapons and hoped that Italy could assist Germany.\nHowever at this time Mussolini stressed one important condition that Italy must pursue in an alliance with Germany: that Italy \"must\u00a0... tow them, not be towed by them\". Italian foreign minister Dino Grandi in the early 1930s stressed the importance of \"decisive weight\", involving Italy's relations between France and Germany, in which he recognized that Italy was not yet a major power, but perceived that Italy did have strong enough influence to alter the political situation in Europe by placing the weight of its support onto one side or another, and sought to balance relations between the three.\nDanube alliance, dispute over Austria.\nIn 1933, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party came to power in Germany. Hitler had advocated an alliance between Germany and Italy since the 1920s. Shortly after being appointed Chancellor of Germany, Hitler sent a personal message to Mussolini, declaring \"admiration and homage\" and declaring his anticipation of the prospects of German\u2013Italian friendship and even alliance. Hitler was aware that Italy held concerns over potential German land claims on South Tyrol, and assured Mussolini that Germany was not interested in South Tyrol. Hitler in \"Mein Kampf\" had declared that South Tyrol was a non-issue considering the advantages that would be gained from a German\u2013Italian alliance. After Hitler's rise to power, the Four Power Directorate proposal by Italy had been looked at with interest by Britain, but Hitler was not committed to it, resulting in Mussolini urging Hitler to consider the diplomatic advantages Germany would gain by breaking out of isolation by entering the Directorate and avoiding an immediate armed conflict. The Four Power Directorate proposal stipulated that Germany would no longer be required to have limited arms and would be granted the right to re-armament under foreign supervision in stages. Hitler completely rejected the idea of controlled rearmament under foreign supervision.\nMussolini did not trust Hitler's intentions regarding Anschluss nor Hitler's promise of no territorial claims on South Tyrol. Mussolini informed Hitler that he was satisfied with the presence of the anti-Marxist government of Engelbert Dollfuss in the First Austrian Republic, and warned Hitler that he was adamantly opposed to Anschluss. Hitler responded in contempt to Mussolini that he intended \"to throw Dollfuss into the sea\". With this disagreement over Austria, relations between Hitler and Mussolini steadily became more distant.\nHitler attempted to break the impasse with Italy over Austria by sending Hermann G\u00f6ring to negotiate with Mussolini in 1933 to convince Mussolini to press Austria to appoint Austrian Nazis to the government. G\u00f6ring claimed that Nazi domination of Austria was inevitable and that Italy should accept this, as well as repeating to Mussolini of Hitler's promise to \"regard the question of the South Tyrol frontier as finally liquidated by the peace treaties\". In response to G\u00f6ring's visit with Mussolini, Dollfuss immediately went to Italy to counter any German diplomatic headway. Dollfuss claimed that his government was actively challenging Marxists in Austria and claimed that once the Marxists were defeated in Austria, that support for Austria's Nazis would decline.\nIn June 1934, Hitler and Mussolini met for the first time, in Venice. The meeting did not proceed amicably. Hitler demanded that Mussolini compromise on Austria by pressuring Dollfuss to appoint Austrian Nazis to his cabinet, to which Mussolini flatly refused the demand. In response, Hitler promised that he would accept Austria's independence for the time being, saying that due to the internal tensions in Germany (referring to sections of the Nazi Sturmabteilung that Hitler would soon kill in the Night of the Long Knives) that Germany could not afford to provoke Italy. Galeazzo Ciano told the press that the two leaders had made a \"gentleman's agreement\" to avoid interfering in Austria.\nSeveral weeks after the Venice meeting, on 25 July 1934, Austrian Nazis assassinated Dollfuss. Mussolini was outraged as he held Hitler directly responsible for the assassination that violated Hitler's promise made only weeks ago to respect Austrian independence. Mussolini rapidly deployed several army divisions and air squadrons to the Brenner Pass, and warned that a German move against Austria would result in war between Germany and Italy. Hitler responded by both denying Nazi responsibility for the assassination and issuing orders to dissolve all ties between the German Nazi Party and its Austrian branch, which Germany claimed was responsible for the political crisis.\nItaly effectively abandoned diplomatic relations with Germany while turning to France in order to challenge Germany's intransigence by signing a Franco\u2013Italian accord to protect Austrian independence. French and Italian military staff discussed possible military cooperation involving a war with Germany should Hitler dare to attack Austria.\nRelations between Germany and Italy recovered due to Hitler's support of Italy's invasion of Ethiopia in 1935, while other countries condemned the invasion and advocated sanctions against Italy.\nDevelopment of German\u2013Italian\u2013Japanese alliance.\nInterest in Germany and Japan in forming an alliance began when Japanese diplomat Hiroshi \u014cshima visited Joachim von Ribbentrop in Berlin in 1935. Although at the time Japan was unwilling to make an alliance against the United Kingdom and France, Oshima informed von Ribbentrop of Japan's interest in forming a German\u2013Japanese alliance against the Soviet Union. Von Ribbentrop expanded on Oshima's proposal by advocating that the alliance be based in a political context of a pact to oppose the Comintern. The proposed pact was met with mixed reviews in Japan, with a faction of ultra-nationalists within the government supporting the pact while the Imperial Japanese Navy and the Japanese Foreign Ministry were staunchly opposed to the pact. There was great concern in the Japanese government that such a pact with Germany could disrupt Japan's relations with Britain, endangering years of a beneficial Anglo-Japanese accord, that had allowed Japan to ascend in the international community in the first place. The response to the pact was met with similar division in Germany; while the proposed pact was popular amongst the upper echelons of the Nazi Party, it was opposed by many in the Foreign Ministry, the Army, and the business community who held financial interests in the Republic of China to which Japan was hostile.\nOn learning of German\u2013Japanese negotiations, Italy also began to take an interest in forming an alliance with Japan. Italy had hoped that due to Japan's long-term close relations with Britain, that an Italo-Japanese alliance could pressure Britain into adopting a more accommodating stance towards Italy in the Mediterranean. In the summer of 1936, Italian Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano informed Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Sugimura Yotaro, \"I have heard that a Japanese\u2013German agreement concerning the Soviet Union has been reached, and I think it would be natural for a similar agreement to be made between Italy and Japan.\" Initially Japan's attitude towards Italy's proposal was generally dismissive, viewing a German\u2013Japanese alliance against the Soviet Union as imperative while regarding an Italo-Japanese alliance as secondary, as Japan anticipated that an Italo-Japanese alliance would antagonize Britain that had condemned Italy's invasion of Ethiopia. This attitude by Japan towards Italy altered in 1937 after the League of Nations condemned Japan for aggression in China and faced international isolation, while Italy remained favourable to Japan. As a result of Italy's support for Japan against international condemnation, Japan took a more positive attitude towards Italy and offered proposals for a non-aggression or neutrality pact with Italy.\nThe Tripartite Pact was signed by Germany, Italy, and Japan on 27 September 1940, in Berlin. The pact was subsequently joined by Hungary (20 November 1940), Romania (23 November 1940), Slovakia (24 November 1940), and Bulgaria (1 March 1941).\nIdeology.\nThe Axis powers' primary goal was territorial expansion at the expense of their neighbors. In ideological terms, the Axis described their goals as breaking the hegemony of the plutocratic Western powers and defending civilization from communism. The Axis championed a number of variants on fascism, militarism, conservatism and autarky. Creation of territorially contiguous autarkic empires was a common goal of all three major Axis powers.\nEconomic resources.\nThe Axis population in 1938 was 258.9\u00a0million, while the Allied population (excluding the Soviet Union and the United States, which later joined the Allies) was 689.7\u00a0million. Thus the Allied powers outnumbered the Axis powers by 2.7 to 1. The leading Axis states had the following domestic populations: Germany 75.5\u00a0million (including 6.8\u00a0million from recently annexed Austria), Japan 71.9\u00a0million (excluding its colonies), and Italy 43.4\u00a0million (excluding its colonies). The United Kingdom (excluding its colonies) had a population of 47.5\u00a0million and France (excluding its colonies) 42\u00a0million.\nThe wartime gross domestic product (GDP) of the Axis was $911\u00a0billion at its highest in 1941 in international dollars by 1990 prices. The GDP of the Allied powers was $1,798\u00a0billion. The United States stood at $1,094\u00a0billion, more than the Axis combined.\nThe burden of the war upon participating countries has been measured through the percentage of gross national product (GNP) devoted to military expenditures. Nearly one-quarter of Germany's GNP was committed to the war effort in 1939, and this rose to three-quarters of GNP in 1944, prior to the collapse of the economy. In 1939, Japan committed 22 percent of its GNP to its war effort in China; this rose to three-quarters of GNP in 1944. Italy did not mobilize its economy; its GNP committed to the war effort remained at prewar levels.\nItaly and Japan lacked industrial capacity; their economies were small, dependent on international trade, external sources of fuel and other industrial resources. As a result, Italian and Japanese mobilization remained low, even by 1943.\nAmong the three major Axis powers, Japan had the lowest per capita income, while Germany and Italy had an income level comparable to the United Kingdom.\nRomania's oil gave the country a disproportionate importance in the global conflict. In 1940 and 1941, Romania supplied 94% and 75% of Germany's oil imports respectively. Italy \u2013 which lacked both natural and synthetic output \u2013 was even more reliant on Romanian oil than Germany. The loss of Romania's oil \u2013 following the country's defection from the Axis in August 1944 \u2013 resulted in Hitler's first admission that the war was lost.\nMajor Axis powers.\nGermany.\nWar justifications.\nHitler in 1941 described the outbreak of World War II as the fault of the intervention of Western powers against Germany during its war with Poland, describing it as the result of \"the European and American warmongers\". Hitler had designs for Germany to become the dominant and leading state in the world, such as his intention for Germany's capital of Berlin to become the \"Welthauptstadt\" (\"World Capital\"), renamed Germania. The German government also justified its actions by claiming that Germany inevitably needed to territorially expand because it was facing an overpopulation crisis that Hitler described: \"We are overpopulated and cannot feed ourselves from our own resources\". Thus expansion was justified as an inevitable necessity to provide \"lebensraum\" (\"living space\") for the German nation and end the country's overpopulation within existing confined territory, and provide resources necessary to its people's well-being. Since the 1920s, the Nazi Party publicly promoted the expansion of Germany into territories held by the Soviet Union.\nGermany justified its war against Poland on the issues of German minority within Poland and Polish opposition to the incorporation of the ethnically German-majority Free City of Danzig into Germany. While Hitler and the Nazi party before taking power openly talked about destroying Poland and were hostile to Poles, after gaining power until February 1939 Hitler tried to conceal his true intentions towards Poland, and signed a 10-year Non-Aggression Pact in 1934, revealing his plans to only to his closest associates. Relations between Germany and Poland altered from the early to the late 1930s, as Germany sought rapprochement with Poland to avoid the risk of Poland entering the Soviet sphere of influence, and appealed to anti-Soviet sentiment in Poland. Hitler even tried to convince Poland to join the Anti-Comintern Pact. The Soviet Union in turn at this time competed with Germany for influence in Poland. At the same time Germany was preparing for a war with Poland and was secretly preparing the German minority in Poland for a war.\nA diplomatic crisis erupted following Hitler demanding that the Free City of Danzig be annexed to Germany, as it was led by a Nazi government seeking annexation to Germany. Germany used legal precedents to justify its intervention against Poland and annexation of the Free City of Danzig (led by a local Nazi government that sought incorporation into Germany) in 1939. Poland rejected Germany's demands and Germany in response prepared a general mobilization on the morning of 30 August 1939.\nGermany justified its invasion of the Low Countries of Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands in May 1940 by claiming that it suspected that Britain and France were preparing to use the Low Countries to launch an invasion of the industrial Ruhr region of Germany. When war between Germany versus Britain and France appeared likely in May 1939, Hitler declared that the Netherlands and Belgium would need to be occupied, saying: \"Dutch and Belgian air bases must be occupied\u00a0... Declarations of neutrality must be ignored\". In a conference with Germany's military leaders on 23 November 1939, Hitler declared to the military leaders that \"We have an Achilles heel, the Ruhr\", and said that \"If England and France push through Belgium and Holland into the Ruhr, we shall be in the greatest danger\", and thus claimed that Belgium and the Netherlands had to be occupied by Germany to protect Germany from a British-French offensive against the Ruhr, irrespective of their claims to neutrality.\nGermany's invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 involved issues of \"lebensraum\", anti-communism, and Soviet foreign policy. After Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, the Nazi regime's stance towards an independent, territorially-reduced Russia was affected by pressure beginning in 1942 from the German Army on Hitler to endorse a \"Russian Liberation Army\" led by Andrey Vlasov. Initially the proposal to support an anti-communist Russian army was met with outright rejection by Hitler, however by 1944 as Germany faced mounting losses on the Eastern Front, Vlasov's forces were recognized by Germany as an ally, particularly by Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS Heinrich Himmler.\nAfter the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the outbreak of war between Japan and the United States, Germany supported Japan by declaring war on the US. During the war Germany denounced the Atlantic Charter and the Lend-Lease Act that the US adopted to support the Allied powers prior to entry into the alliance, as imperialism directed at dominating and exploiting countries outside of the continental Americas. Hitler denounced American President Franklin D. Roosevelt's invoking of the term \"freedom\" to describe US actions in the war, and accused the American meaning of \"freedom\" to be the freedom for democracy to exploit the world and the freedom for plutocrats within such democracy to exploit the masses.\nHistory.\nAt the end of World War I, German citizens felt that their country had been humiliated as a result of the Treaty of Versailles, which included a war guilt clause and forced Germany to pay enormous reparations payments and forfeit territories formerly controlled by the German Empire and all its colonies. The pressure of the reparations on the German economy led to hyperinflation during the early 1920s. In 1923 the French occupied the Ruhr region when Germany defaulted on its reparations payments. Although Germany began to improve economically in the mid-1920s, the Great Depression created more economic hardship and a rise in political forces that advocated radical solutions to Germany's woes. The Nazis, under Hitler, promoted the nationalist stab-in-the-back legend stating that Germany had been betrayed by Jews and Communists. The party promised to rebuild Germany as a major power and create a Greater Germany that would include Alsace-Lorraine, Austria, Sudetenland, and other German-populated territories in Europe. The Nazis also aimed to occupy and colonize non-German territories in Poland, the Baltic states, and the Soviet Union, as part of the Nazi policy of seeking \"Lebensraum\" (\"living space\") in Central and Eastern Europe.\nGermany renounced the Versailles treaty and remilitarized the Rhineland in March 1936. Germany had already resumed conscription and announced the existence of a German air force, the Luftwaffe, and naval force, the Kriegsmarine in 1935. Germany annexed Austria in 1938, the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia, and the Memel territory from Lithuania in 1939. Germany then invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia in 1939, creating the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and the country of Slovakia.\nOn 23 August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, which contained a secret protocol dividing eastern Europe into spheres of influence. Germany's invasion of its part of Poland under the Pact eight days later triggered the beginning of World War II. By the end of 1941, Germany occupied a large part of Europe and its military forces were fighting the Soviet Union, nearly capturing Moscow. However, crushing defeats at the Battle of Stalingrad and the Battle of Kursk devastated the German armed forces. This, combined with Western Allied landings in France and Italy, led to a three-front war that depleted Germany's armed forces and resulted in Germany's defeat in 1945.\nOccupied territories.\nThe Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was created from the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. Shortly after Germany annexed the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, the Slovak Republic declared its independence from the rump Second Czechoslovak Republic. The new Slovak State allied itself with Germany. The remainder of the country was occupied by German military forces and organized into the Protectorate. Czech civil institutions were preserved but the Protectorate was considered within the sovereign territory of Germany.\nThe General Government was the name given to the territories of occupied Poland that were not directly annexed into German provinces, but like Bohemia and Moravia was considered within the sovereign territory of Germany by the Nazi authorities.\nReichskommissariats were established in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Norway, designated as places the \"Germanic\" populations of which were to be incorporated into the planned Greater Germanic Reich. By contrast the Reichskommissariats established in the east (Reichskommissariat Ostland in the Baltics, Reichskommissariat Ukraine in Ukraine) were established as colonies for settlement by Germans.\nIn Norway, under Reichskommissariat Norwegen, the Quisling regime, headed by Vidkun Quisling, was installed by the Germans as a client regime during the occupation, while king Haakon VII and the legal government were in exile. Quisling encouraged Norwegians to serve as volunteers in the Waffen-SS, collaborated in the deportation of Jews, and was responsible for the executions of members of the Norwegian resistance movement. About 45,000 Norwegian collaborators joined the pro-Nazi party \"Nasjonal Samling\" (National Union), and some police units helped arrest many Jews. However, Norway was one of the first countries where resistance during World War II was widespread before the turning point of the war in 1943. After the war, Quisling and other collaborators were executed. Quisling's name has become an international eponym for traitor.\nItaly.\nWar justifications.\n\"Duce\" Benito Mussolini described Italy's declaration of war against the Western Allies of Britain and France in June 1940 as the following: \"We are going to war against the plutocratic and reactionary democracies of the West who have invariably hindered the progress and often threatened the very existence of the Italian people\". Italy condemned the Western powers for enacting sanctions on Italy in 1935 for its actions in the Second Italo-Ethiopian War that Italy claimed was a response to an act of Ethiopian aggression against tribesmen in Italian Eritrea in the Walwal incident of 1934. Italy, like Germany, also justified its actions by claiming that Italy needed to territorially expand to provide \"spazio vitale\" (\"vital space\") for the Italian nation.\nIn October 1938 in the aftermath of the Munich Agreement, Italy demanded concessions from France to yield to Italy in Africa. Relations between Italy and France deteriorated with France's refusal to accept Italy's demands. France responded to Italy's demands with threatening naval manoeuvres as a warning to Italy. As tensions between Italy and France grew, Hitler made a major speech on 30 January 1939 in which he promised German military support in the case of an unprovoked war against Italy.\nItaly entered World War II on 10 June 1940. Italy justified its intervention against Greece in October 1940 on the allegation that the Kingdom of Greece was being used by Britain against Italy, Mussolini informed this to Hitler, saying: \"Greece is one of the main points of English maritime strategy in the Mediterranean\".\nItaly justified its intervention against Yugoslavia in April 1941 by appealing to both Italian irredentist claims and the fact of Albanian, Croatian, and Macedonian separatists not wishing to be part of Yugoslavia. Croatian separatism soared after the assassination of Croatian political leaders in the National Assembly of Yugoslavia in 1928 including the death of Stjepan Radi\u0107, and Italy endorsed Croatian separatist Ante Paveli\u0107 and his fascist Usta\u0161e movement that was based and trained in Italy with the Fascist regime's support prior to intervention against Yugoslavia.\nHistory.\nThe intention of the Fascist regime was to create a \"New Roman Empire\" in which Italy would dominate the Mediterranean. In 1935\u20131936 Italy invaded and annexed Ethiopia and the Fascist government proclaimed the creation of the \"Italian Empire\". Protests by the League of Nations, especially the British, who had interests in that area, led to no serious action, although The League did try to enforce economic sanctions upon Italy, but to no avail. The incident highlighted French and British weakness, exemplified by their reluctance to alienate Italy and lose her as their ally. The limited actions taken by the Western powers pushed Mussolini's Italy towards alliance with Hitler's Germany anyway. In 1937 Italy left the League of Nations and joined the Anti-Comintern Pact, which had been signed by Germany and Japan the preceding year. In March/April 1939 Italian troops invaded and annexed Albania. Germany and Italy signed the Pact of Steel on May 22.\nItaly was ill-prepared for war, in spite of the fact that it had continuously been involved in conflict since 1935, first with Ethiopia in 1935\u20131936 and then in the Spanish Civil War on the side of Francisco Franco's Nationalists. \nMussolini refused to heed warnings from his minister of exchange and currency, Felice Guarneri, who said that Italy's actions in Ethiopia and Spain meant that Italy was on the verge of bankruptcy. By 1939 military expenditures by Britain and France far exceeded what Italy could afford. As a result of Italy's economic difficulties its soldiers were poorly paid, often being poorly equipped and poorly supplied, and animosity arose between soldiers and class-conscious officers; these contributed to low morale amongst Italian soldiers.\nBy early 1940, Italy was still a non-belligerent, and Mussolini communicated to Hitler that Italy was not prepared to intervene soon. By March 1940, Mussolini decided that Italy would intervene, but the date was not yet chosen. His senior military leadership unanimously opposed the action because Italy was unprepared. No raw materials had been stockpiled and the reserves it did have would soon be exhausted, Italy's industrial base was only one-tenth of Germany's, and even with supplies the Italian military was not organized to provide the equipment needed to fight a modern war of a long duration. An ambitious rearmament program was impossible because of Italy's limited reserves in gold and foreign currencies and lack of raw materials. Mussolini ignored the negative advice.\nBy 1941, Italy's attempts to run an autonomous campaign from Germany's, collapsed as a result of military setbacks in Greece, North Africa, and Eastern Africa; and the country became dependent and effectively subordinate to Germany. After the German-led invasion and occupation of Yugoslavia and Greece, that had both been targets of Italy's war aims, Italy was forced to accept German dominance in the two occupied countries. Furthermore, by 1941, German forces in North Africa under Erwin Rommel effectively took charge of the military effort ousting Allied forces from the Italian colony of Libya, and German forces were stationed in Sicily in that year. Germany's insolence towards Italy as an ally was demonstrated that year when Italy was pressured to send 350,000 \"guest workers\" to Germany who were used as forced labour. While Hitler was disappointed with the Italian military's performance, he maintained overall favorable relations with Italy because of his personal friendship with Mussolini.\nOn 25 July 1943, following the Allied invasion of Sicily, King Victor Emmanuel III dismissed Mussolini, placed him under arrest, and began secret negotiations with the Western Allies. An armistice was signed on 8 September 1943, and four days later Mussolini was rescued by the Germans in Operation Oak and placed in charge of a puppet state called the Italian Social Republic (\"Repubblica Sociale Italiana\"/RSI, or \"Repubblica di Sal\u00f2\") in northern Italy. In order to liberate the country from the Germans and Fascists, Italy became a co-belligerent of the Allies; as result, the country descended in Civil War, with the Italian Co-Belligerent Army and the partisans, supported by the Allies, contended the Social Republic's forces and its German allies. Some areas in Northern Italy were liberated from the Germans as late as May, 1945. Mussolini was killed by Communist partisans on 28 April 1945 while trying to escape to Switzerland.\nColonies and dependencies.\nIn Europe.\nThe Dodecanese Islands were an Italian dependency known as the Italian Islands of the Aegean from 1912 to 1943.\nMontenegro was an Italian dependency from 1941 to 1943 known as the Governorate of Montenegro that was under the control of an Italian military governor. Initially, the Italians intended that Montenegro would become an \"independent\" state closely allied with Italy, reinforced through the strong dynastic links between Italy and Montenegro, as Queen Elena of Italy was a daughter of the last Montenegrin king Nicholas I. The Italian-backed Montenegrin nationalist Sekula Drljevi\u0107 and his followers attempted to create a Montenegrin state. On 12 July 1941, they proclaimed the \"Kingdom of Montenegro\" under the protection of Italy. In less than 24 hours, that triggered a general uprising against the Italians. Within three weeks, the insurgents managed to capture almost all the territory of Montenegro. Over 70,000 Royal Italian Army troops and 20,000 of Albanian and Muslim irregulars were deployed to suppress the rebellion. Drljevic was expelled from Montenegro in October 1941. Montenegro then came under full direct Italian control. With the Italian capitulation of 1943, Montenegro came directly under the control of Germany.\nPolitically and economically dominated by Italy from its creation in 1913, Albania was occupied by Italian military forces in 1939 as the Albanian king Zog l fled the country with his family. The Albanian parliament voted to offer the Albanian throne to the King of Italy, resulting in a personal union between the two countries.\nIn Africa.\nItalian East Africa was an Italian colony existing from 1936 to 1943. Prior to the invasion and annexation of Ethiopia into this united colony in 1936, Italy had two colonies, Eritrea and Somalia since the 1880s.\nLibya was an Italian colony existing from 1912 to 1943. The northern portion of Libya was incorporated directly into Italy in 1939; however the region remained united as a colony under a colonial governor.\nJapan.\nWar justifications.\nThe Japanese government justified its actions by claiming that it was seeking to unite East Asia under Japanese leadership in a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere that would free East Asians from domination and rule by clients of Western powers. Japan invoked themes of Pan-Asianism and said that the Asian people needed to be free from Western influence.\nThe United States opposed the Second Sino-Japanese War, and recognized Chiang Kai-Shek's Nationalist Government as the legitimate government of China. As a result, the United States sought to bring the Japanese war effort to a halt by imposing an embargo on all trade between the United States and Japan. Japan was dependent on the United States for 80 percent of its petroleum, and as a consequence the embargo resulted in an economic and military crisis for Japan, as Japan could not continue its war effort against China without access to petroleum.\nIn order to maintain its military campaign in China with the major loss of petroleum trade with the United States, Japan saw the best means to secure an alternative source of petroleum in the petroleum-rich and natural-resources-rich Southeast Asia. This threat of retaliation by Japan to the total trade embargo by the United States was known by the American government, including American Secretary of State Cordell Hull who was negotiating with the Japanese to avoid a war, fearing that the total embargo would pre-empt a Japanese attack on the Dutch East Indies.\nJapan identified the United States Pacific Fleet based in Pearl Harbor Naval Base as the principal threat to its designs to invade and capture Southeast Asia. Thus Japan initiated the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 as a means to inhibit an American response to the invasion of Southeast Asia, and buy time to allow Japan to consolidate itself with these resources to engage in a total war against the United States, and force the United States to accept Japan's acquisitions. On 7 December 1941 Japan declared war on the United States and the British Empire.\nHistory.\nThe Empire of Japan, a constitutional monarchy with Hirohito as its Emperor, was the principal Axis power in Asia and the Pacific. Under the emperor were a political cabinet and the Imperial General Headquarters, with two chiefs of staff. By 1945 the Emperor of Japan was more than a symbolic leader; he played a major role in devising a strategy to keep himself on the throne.\nAt its peak, Japan's Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere included Manchuria, Inner Mongolia, large parts of China, Malaysia, French Indochina, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, Burma, a small part of India, and various Pacific Islands in the central Pacific.\nAs a result of the internal discord and economic downturn of the 1920s, militaristic elements set Japan on a path of expansionism. As the Japanese home islands lacked natural resources needed for growth, Japan planned to establish hegemony in Asia and become self-sufficient by acquiring territories with abundant natural resources. Japan's expansionist policies alienated it from other countries in the League of Nations and by the mid-1930s brought it closer to Germany and Italy, who had both pursued similar expansionist policies. Cooperation between Japan and Germany began with the Anti-Comintern Pact, in which the two countries agreed to ally to challenge any attack by the Soviet Union.\nJapan entered into conflict against the Chinese in 1937. The Japanese invasion and occupation of parts of China resulted in numerous atrocities against civilians, such as the Nanjing Massacre and the Three Alls Policy. The Japanese also fought skirmishes with Soviet\u2013Mongolian forces in Manchukuo in 1938 and 1939. Japan sought to avoid war with the Soviet Union by signing a non-aggression pact with it in 1941.\nJapan's military leaders were divided on diplomatic relationships with Germany and Italy and the attitude towards the United States. The Imperial Japanese Army was in favour of war with the United States, but the Imperial Japanese Navy was generally strongly opposed. When Prime Minister of Japan General Hideki Tojo refused American demands that Japan withdraw its military forces from China, a confrontation became more likely. War with the United States was being discussed within the Japanese government by 1940. Commander of the Combined Fleet Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto was outspoken in his opposition, especially after the signing of the Tripartite Pact, saying on 14 October 1940: \"To fight the United States is like fighting the whole world. But it has been decided. So I will fight the best I can. Doubtless I shall die on board [his flagship]. Meanwhile, Tokyo will be burnt to the ground three times. Konoe and others will be torn to pieces by the revengeful people, I [shouldn't] wonder. \" In October and November 1940, Yamamoto communicated with Navy Minister Oikawa, and stated, \"Unlike the pre-Tripartite days, great determination is required to make certain that we avoid the danger of going to war. \"\nWith the European powers focused on the war in Europe, Japan sought to acquire their colonies. In 1940 Japan responded to the German invasion of France by occupying northern French Indochina. The Vichy France regime, a \"de facto\" ally of Germany, accepted the takeover. The allied forces did not respond with war. However, the United States instituted an embargo against Japan in 1941 because of the continuing war in China. This cut off Japan's supply of scrap metal and oil needed for industry, trade, and the war effort.\nTo isolate the US forces stationed in the Philippines and to reduce US naval power, the Imperial General Headquarters ordered an attack on the US naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 7 December 1941. They also invaded Malaya and Hong Kong. Initially achieving a series of victories, by 1943 the Japanese forces were driven back towards the home islands. The Pacific War lasted until the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. The Soviets formally declared war in August 1945 and engaged Japanese forces in Manchuria and northeast China.\nColonies and dependencies.\nTaiwan was a Japanese dependency established in 1895. Korea was a Japanese protectorate and dependency formally established by the Japan\u2013Korea Treaty of 1910.\nThe South Seas Mandate were territories granted to Japan in 1919 in the peace agreements of World War I, that designated to Japan the German South Pacific islands. Japan received these as a reward by the Allies of World War I, when Japan was then allied against Germany.\nJapan occupied the Dutch East Indies during the war. Japan planned to transform these territories into a client state of Indonesia and sought alliance with Indonesian nationalists including future Indonesian President Sukarno, however these efforts did not deliver the creation of an Indonesian state until after Japan's surrender.\nOther Tripartite Pact signatories.\nIn addition to the three major Axis powers, six other countries signed the Tripartite Pact as its member states. Of the additional countries, Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria, the Independent State of Croatia, and Romania participated in various Axis military operations with their national armed forces, while the sixth, Yugoslavia, saw its Tripartite signatory government overthrown earlier in a coup merely days after it signed the Pact, and the membership was reversed.\nHungary.\nThe Kingdom of Hungary, ruled by Regent Admiral Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, was the first country apart from Germany, Italy, and Japan to adhere to the Tripartite Pact, signing the agreement on 20 November 1940.\nPolitical instability plagued the country until Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, a Hungarian nobleman and Austro-Hungarian naval officer, became regent in 1920. The vast majority of the Hungarians desired to recover former territories of the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen lost through the Treaty of Trianon. During the government of Gyula G\u00f6mb\u00f6s, Hungary drew closer to Germany and Italy largely because of a shared desire to revise the peace settlements made after World War I. Many people sympathized with the anti-Semitic policy of the Nazi regime. Hungary refused to participate in Nazi Germany's planned invasion of Czechoslovakia during the Sudenten Crisis, but after the Munich Agreement carried out a diplomatic rapprochement in order to avoid Germany developing too close of an alliance with Hungary's rival Romania. Due to its supportive stance towards Germany and the new efforts in the international policy, Hungary gained favourable territorial settlements by the First Vienna Award, after the breakup of Czechoslovakia occupied and annexed the remainder of Carpathian Ruthenia and in 1940 received Northern Transylvania from Romania via the Second Vienna Award. Hungarians permitted German troops to transit through their territory during the invasion of Yugoslavia, and Hungarian forces joined the military operations after the proclamation of the Independent State of Croatia. Parts of the former Yugoslavia were annexed to Hungary; the United Kingdom immediately broke off diplomatic relations in response.\nAlthough Hungary did not initially participate in the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Hungary and the Soviet Union became belligerents on 27 June 1941. Over 500,000 soldiers served on the Eastern Front. All five of Hungary's field armies ultimately participated in the war against the Soviet Union; a significant contribution was made by the Hungarian Second Army.\nOn 25 November 1941, Hungary was one of thirteen signatories to the renewed Anti-Comintern Pact. Hungarian troops, like their Axis counterparts, were involved in numerous actions against the Soviets. By the end of 1943, the Soviets had gained the upper hand and the Germans were retreating. The Hungarian Second Army was destroyed in fighting on the Voronezh Front, on the banks of the Don River.\nPrior to the German occupation within the area of Hungary around 63,000 Jews perished. Afterwards, in late 1944, 437,000 Jews were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau, most of them to their deaths. Overall, Hungarian Jews suffered close to 560,000 casualties.\nRelations between Germany and the regency of Mikl\u00f3s Horthy collapsed in 1944 when Horthy attempted to negotiate a peace agreement with the Soviets and jump out of the war without German approval. Horthy was forced to abdicate after German commandos, led by Colonel Otto Skorzeny, held his son hostage as part of Operation Panzerfaust. Hungary was reorganized following Horthy's abdication in December 1944 into a totalitarian regime called the Government of National Unity, led by Ferenc Sz\u00e1lasi. He had been Prime Minister of Hungary since October 1944 and was leader of the Hungarist Arrow Cross Party. Its jurisdiction was effectively limited to an ever-narrowing band of territory in central Hungary, around Budapest since by the time they took power the Red Army was already far inside the country. Nonetheless, the Arrow Cross rule, short-lived as it was, was brutal. In fewer than three months, Arrow Cross death squads killed as many as 38,000 Hungarian Jews. Arrow Cross officers helped Adolf Eichmann re-activate the deportation proceedings from which the Jews of Budapest had thus far been spared, sending some 80,000 Jews out of the city on slave labour details and many more straight to death camps. Most of them died, including many who were murdered outright after the end of the fighting as they were returning home. Days after the Sz\u00e1lasi government took power, the capital of Budapest was surrounded by the Soviet Red Army. German and Hungarian forces tried to hold off the Soviet advance but failed. After fierce fighting, Budapest was taken by the Soviets. A number of pro-German Hungarians retreated to Italy and Germany, where they fought until the end of the war.\nIn March 1945, Sz\u00e1lasi fled to Germany as the leader of a government in exile, until the surrender of Germany in May 1945.\nRomania.\nWith the exception of Germany and Italy, Romania was the only country where a Fascist movement came to power without foreign assistance. When war erupted in Europe, the economy of the Kingdom of Romania was already subordinated to the interests of Nazi Germany through a treaty signed in the spring of 1939. Nevertheless, the country had not totally abandoned pro-British sympathies. Romania had also been allied to the Poles for most of the interwar era. Following the invasion of Poland by Germany and the Soviet Union, and the German conquest of France and the Low Countries, Romania found itself increasingly isolated; meanwhile, pro-German and pro-Fascist elements began to grow.\nThe August 1939 Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact between Germany and the Soviet Union contained a secret protocol ceding Bessarabia, and Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union. On June 28, 1940, the Soviet Union occupied and annexed Bessarabia, as well as part of northern Romania and the Hertsa region. On 30 August 1940, as a result of the German\u2013Italian arbitrated Second Vienna Award Romania had to cede Northern Transylvania to Hungary. Southern Dobruja was ceded to Bulgaria in September 1940. In an effort to appease the Fascist elements within the country and obtain German protection, King Carol II appointed the General Ion Antonescu as Prime Minister on September 6, 1940.\nTwo days later, Antonescu forced the king to abdicate and installed the king's young son Michael (Mihai) on the throne, then declared himself \"Conduc\u0103tor\" (\"Leader\") with dictatorial powers. The National Legionary State was proclaimed on 14 September, with the Iron Guard ruling together with Antonescu as the sole legal political movement in Romania. Under King Michael I and the military government of Antonescu, Romania signed the Tripartite Pact on November 23, 1940. German troops entered the country on 10 October 1941, officially to train the Romanian Army. Hitler's directive to the troops on 10 October had stated that \"it is necessary to avoid even the slightest semblance of military occupation of Romania\". The entrance of German troops in Romania determined Italian dictator Benito Mussolini to launch an invasion of Greece, starting the Greco-Italian War. Having secured Hitler's approval in January 1941, Antonescu ousted the Iron Guard from power.\nRomania was subsequently used as a platform for invasions of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. Despite not being involved militarily in the Invasion of Yugoslavia, Romania requested that Hungarian troops not operate in the Banat. Paulus thus modified the Hungarian plan and kept their troops west of the Tisza.\nRomania joined the German-led invasion of the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941. Antonescu was the only foreign leader Hitler consulted on military matters and the two would meet no less than ten times throughout the war. Romania re-captured Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina during Operation Munchen before conquering further Soviet territory and establishing the Transnistria Governorate. After the Siege of Odessa, the city became the capital of the Governorate. Romanian troops fought their way into the Crimea alongside German troops and contributed significantly to the Siege of Sevastopol. Later, Romanian mountain troops joined the German campaign in the Caucasus, reaching as far as Nalchik. After suffering devastating losses at Stalingrad, Romanian officials began secretly negotiating peace conditions with the Allies.\nRomania's military industry was small but versatile, able to copy and produce thousands of French, Soviet, German, British, and Czechoslovak weapons systems, as well as producing capable original products. The Romanian Navy also built sizable warships, such as the minelayer and the submarines and . Hundreds of originally-designed Romanian Air Force aircraft were also produced, such as the fighter IAR-80 and the light bomber IAR-37. The country had built armored fighting vehicles as well, most notably the Mare\u0219al tank destroyer, that likely influenced the design of the German Hetzer. Romania had also been a major power in the oil industry since the 1800s. It was one of the largest producers in Europe and the Ploie\u0219ti oil refineries provided about 30% of all Axis oil production. British historian Dennis Deletant has asserted that Romania's crucial contributions to the Axis war effort, including having the third largest Axis army in Europe and sustaining the German war effort through oil and other materiel, meant that it was \"on a par with Italy as a principal ally of Germany and not in the category of a minor Axis satellite\". Another British historian, Mark Axworthy, believes that Romania could even be considered to have had the second most important Axis army of Europe, even more so than that of Italy.\nUnder Antonescu Romania was a fascist dictatorship and a totalitarian state. Between 45,000 and 60,000 Jews were killed in Bukovina and Bessarabia by Romanian and German troops in 1941. According to Wilhelm Filderman at least 150,000 Jews of Bessarabia and Bukovina, died under the Antonescu regime (both those deported and those who remained). Overall, approximately 250,000 Jews under Romanian jurisdiction died.\nBy 1943, the tide began to turn. The Soviets pushed further west, retaking Ukraine and eventually launching an unsuccessful invasion of eastern Romania in the spring of 1944. Romanian troops in the Crimea helped repulse initial Soviet landings, but eventually all of the peninsula was re-conquered by Soviet forces and the Romanian Navy evacuated over 100,000 German and Romanian troops, an achievement which earned Romanian Admiral Horia Macellariu the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. During the Jassy-Kishinev Offensive of August 1944, Romania switched sides on August 23, 1944. Romanian troops then fought alongside the Soviet Army until the end of the war, reaching as far as Czechoslovakia and Austria.\nGermany's main European ally (September 1943 \u2013 August 1944).\nAfter the September 1943 Armistice of Cassibile with Italy, Romania became the second Axis power in Europe. The Romanians shared in the spoils of Operation Achse, 5 CB-class midget submarines in the Black Sea being transferred to the Romanian Navy. Romania also captured 496 Italians, mostly naval personnel (2 of them later died). Before the month was out, Germany had agreed to systematically supply the Romanian Army with German military vehicles, via the Olivenbaum I-III and Quittenbaum I programs. Deliveries started in November 1943, and by August 1944, Germany had supplied Romania with 10 times more armored vehicles (Panzer III, Panzer IV and Sturmgesch\u00fctz III) than during the entire pre-Cassibile period. Having acquired the license to produce the Messerschmitt Bf 109, Romania planned to assemble 75 from German parts. Deliveries began in May 1944, but only 6 were completed before Romania left the Axis in August 1944. Eleven more were completed by the end of the war with the remaining 58 completed after the war. In 1944, Romania had also gained access to certain \"Wunderwaffen\", such as the Werfer-Granate 21. The first Romanian-made Fiesler Storch was completed in October 1943, followed by 9 more by May 1944. From March 1944, Germany also contributed to the design and construction of the M-05 and M-06 prototypes of the Mare\u0219al tank destroyer: Alkett contributed to the Romanian design team and Telefunken radios along with B\u00f6hler armor were provided. The 75 mm Re\u0219i\u021ba gun (production started at the end of 1943) used the projectile chamber of the German Pak 40. Technology transfers between the two countries were not necessarily one-way, however. On 6 January 1944, Antonescu showed Hitler the plans of the M-04 prototype of the Mare\u0219al tank destroyer. In May 1944, Lieutenant-Colonel Ventz from the \"Waffenamt\" acknowledged that the \"Hetzer\" had followed the Romanian design. German-led Army Group South Ukraine could not take major operational decisions without securing Ion Antonescu's approval, even as late as 22 August 1944 (the day before he was dismissed). An entire German army (the 6th) came under Romanian command in May 1944, when it became part of Romanian general Petre Dumitrescu's \"Armeegruppe\". For the first time in the war, German commanders came under the actual (rather than nominal) command of their foreign allies. This Romanian-led army group had 24 divisions of which 17 were German.\nSlovakia.\nThe Slovak Republic under President Jozef Tiso signed the Tripartite Pact on 24 November 1940.\nSlovakia had been closely aligned with Germany almost immediately from its declaration of independence from Czechoslovakia on 14 March 1939. Slovakia entered into a treaty of protection with Germany on 23 March 1939.\nSlovak troops joined the German invasion of Poland, having interest in Spi\u0161 and Orava. Those two regions, along with Cieszyn Silesia, had been disputed between Poland and Czechoslovakia since 1918. The Poles fully annexed them following the Munich Agreement. After the invasion of Poland, Slovakia reclaimed control of those territories.\nSlovakia invaded Poland alongside German forces, contributing 50,000 men at this stage of the war.\nSlovakia declared war on the Soviet Union in 1941 and signed the revived Anti-Comintern Pact in 1941. Slovak troops fought on Germany's Eastern Front, furnishing Germany with two divisions totaling 80,000 men. Slovakia declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States in 1942.\nSlovakia was spared German military occupation until the Slovak National Uprising, which began on 29 August 1944, and was almost immediately crushed by the Waffen SS and Slovak troops loyal to Josef Tiso.\nAfter the war, Tiso was executed and Slovakia once again became part of Czechoslovakia. The border with Poland was shifted back to the pre-war state.\nBulgaria.\nThe Tsardom of Bulgaria was ruled by \u0422sar Boris III when it signed the Tripartite Pact on 1 March 1941. Bulgaria had been on the losing side in the First World War and sought a return of what the Bulgarian leadership saw as lost ethnically and historically Bulgarian territories, specifically in Macedonia and Thrace (divided between the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the Kingdom of Greece, and Turkey). During the 1930s, because of traditional right-wing elements, Bulgaria drew closer to Nazi Germany. In 1940 Germany pressured Romania to sign the Treaty of Craiova, returning to Bulgaria the region of Southern Dobrudja, which it had lost in 1913. The Germans also promised Bulgaria \u2013 if it joined the Axis \u2013 an enlargement of its territory to the borders specified in the Treaty of San Stefano.\nBulgaria participated in the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia and Greece by letting German troops attack from its territory and sent troops to Greece on April 20. As a reward, the Axis powers allowed Bulgaria to occupy parts of both countries\u00a0\u2013 southern and south-eastern Yugoslavia (Vardar Banovina) and north-eastern Greece (parts of Greek Macedonia and Greek Thrace). The Bulgarian forces in these areas spent the following years fighting various nationalist groups and resistance movements. Despite German pressure, Bulgaria did not take part in the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union and actually never declared war on the Soviet Union. The Bulgarian Navy was nonetheless involved in a number of skirmishes with the Soviet Black Sea Fleet, which attacked Bulgarian shipping.\nFollowing the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the Bulgarian government declared war on the Western Allies. This action remained largely symbolic (at least from the Bulgarian perspective), until August 1943, when Bulgarian air defense and air force attacked Allied bombers, returning (heavily damaged) from a mission over the Romanian oil refineries. This turned into a disaster for the citizens of Sofia and other major Bulgarian cities, which were heavily bombed by the Allies in the winter of 1943\u20131944.\nOn 2 September 1944, as the Red Army approached the Bulgarian border, a new Bulgarian government came to power and sought peace with the Allies, expelled the few remaining German troops, and declared neutrality. These measures however did not prevent the Soviet Union from declaring war on Bulgaria on 5 September, and on 8 September the Red Army marched into the country, meeting no resistance. This was followed by the coup d'\u00e9tat of 9 September 1944, which brought a government of the pro-Soviet Fatherland Front to power. After this, the Bulgarian army (as part of the Red Army's 3rd Ukrainian Front) fought the Germans in Yugoslavia and Hungary, sustaining numerous casualties. Despite this, the Paris Peace Treaty treated Bulgaria as one of the defeated countries. Bulgaria was allowed to keep Southern Dobruja, but had to give up all claims to Greek and Yugoslav territory.\nIndependent State of Croatia.\nOn 10 April 1941, the so-called Independent State of Croatia (\"Nezavisna Dr\u017eava Hrvatska\", or NDH), an installed German\u2013Italian puppet state, co-signed the Tripartite Pact. The NDH remained a member of the Axis until the end of Second World War, its forces fighting for Germany even after its territory had been overrun by Yugoslav Partisans. On 16 April 1941, Ante Paveli\u0107, a Croatian nationalist and one of the founders of the Usta\u0161e (\"Croatian Liberation Movement\"), was proclaimed \"Poglavnik\" (leader) of the new regime.\nInitially the Usta\u0161e had been heavily influenced by Italy. They were actively supported by Mussolini's National Fascist Party regime in Italy, which gave the movement training grounds to prepare for war against Yugoslavia, as well as accepting Paveli\u0107 as an exile and allowing him to reside in Rome. In 1941 during the Italian invasion of Greece, Mussolini requested that Germany invade Yugoslavia to save the Italian forces in Greece. Hitler reluctantly agreed; Yugoslavia was invaded and the NDH was created. Paveli\u0107 led a delegation to Rome and offered the crown of the NDH to an Italian prince of the House of Savoy, who was crowned Tomislav II. The next day, Paveli\u0107 signed the Contracts of Rome with Mussolini, ceding Dalmatia to Italy and fixing the permanent borders between the NDH and Italy. Italian armed forces were allowed to control all of the coastline of the NDH, effectively giving Italy total control of the Adriatic coastline. When the King of Italy ousted Mussolini from power and Italy capitulated, the NDH became completely under German influence.\nThe platform of the Usta\u0161e movement proclaimed that Croatians had been oppressed by the Serb-dominated Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and that Croatians deserved to have an independent nation after years of domination by foreign empires. The Usta\u0161e perceived Serbs to be racially inferior to Croats and saw them as infiltrators who were occupying Croatian lands. They saw the extermination and expulsion or deportation of Serbs as necessary to racially purify Croatia. While part of Yugoslavia, many Croatian nationalists violently opposed the Serb-dominated Yugoslav monarchy, and assassinated Alexander I of Yugoslavia, together with the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization. Ustashe forces fought against communist Yugoslav Partisan guerrilla throughout the war.\nThe Usta\u0161e regime lacked general support among Croats and never accrued any significant support among the populace. The Usta\u0161e regime was backed by parts of the Croat population that during the interwar period had felt oppressed in the Serb-led Yugoslavia. Most of the support it had initially gained by creating a Croatian national state was lost because of the brutal practices it used.\nUpon coming to power, Paveli\u0107 formed the Croatian Home Guard (\"Hrvatsko domobranstvo\") as the official military force of the NDH. Originally authorized at 16,000 men, it grew to a peak fighting force of 130,000. The Croatian Home Guard included an air force and navy, although its navy was restricted in size by the Contracts of Rome. In addition to the Croatian Home Guard, Paveli\u0107 was also the supreme commander of the Usta\u0161e militia, although all NDH military units were generally under the command of the German or Italian formations in their area of operations.\nThe Usta\u0161e government declared war on the Soviet Union, signed the Anti-Comintern Pact of 1941, and sent troops to Germany's Eastern Front. Usta\u0161e militia were garrisoned in the Balkans, battling the communist partisans.\nThe Usta\u0161e government applied racial laws on Serbs, Jews, and Romani people, as well as targeting those opposed to the fascist regime, and after June 1941 deported them to the Jasenovac concentration camp or to Nazi concentration camps in Poland. The racial laws were enforced by the Usta\u0161e militia. The exact number of victims of the Usta\u0161e regime is uncertain due to the destruction of documents and varying numbers given by historians. According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., between 320,000 and 340,000 Serbs were killed in the NDH.\nYugoslavia (two-day membership).\nYugoslavia was largely surrounded by members of the pact and now bordered the German Reich. From late 1940 Hitler sought a non-aggression pact with Yugoslavia. In February 1941, Hitler called for Yugoslavia's accession to the Tripartite Pact, but the Yugoslav government delayed. In March, divisions of the German army arrived at the Bulgarian-Yugoslav border and permission was sought for them to pass through to attack Greece. On 25 March 1941, fearing that Yugoslavia would be invaded otherwise, the Yugoslav government signed the Tripartite Pact with significant reservations. Unlike other Axis powers, Yugoslavia was not obliged to provide military assistance, nor to provide its territory for Axis to move military forces during the war. Less than two days later, after demonstrations in the streets of Belgrade, Prince Paul and the government were removed from office by a coup d'\u00e9tat. Seventeen-year-old King Peter was declared to be of age. The new Yugoslav government under General Du\u0161an Simovi\u0107, refused to ratify Yugoslavia's signing of the Tripartite Pact, and started negotiations with Great Britain and Soviet Union. Winston Churchill commented that \"Yugoslavia has found its soul\"; however, Hitler invaded and quickly took control.\nAnti-Comintern Pact signatories.\nSome countries signed the Anti-Comintern Pact but not the Tripartite Pact. As such their adherence to the Axis may have been less than that of Tripartite Pact signatories. Some of these states were officially at war with members of the Allied powers, others remained neutral in the war and sent only volunteers. Signing the Anti-Comintern Pact was seen as \"a litmus test of loyalty\" by the Nazi leadership.\nChina (Reorganized National Government of China).\nDuring the Second Sino-Japanese War, Japan advanced from its bases in Manchuria to occupy much of East and Central China. Several Japanese puppet states were organized in areas occupied by the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces, including the Provisional Government of the Republic of China at Beijing, which was formed in 1937, and the Reformed Government of the Republic of China at Nanjing, which was formed in 1938. These governments were merged into the Reorganized National Government of China at Nanjing on 29 March 1940. Wang Jingwei became head of state. The government was to be run along the same lines as the Nationalist regime and adopted its symbols.\nThe Nanjing Government had no real power; its main role was to act as a propaganda tool for the Japanese. The Nanjing Government concluded agreements with Japan and Manchukuo, authorising Japanese occupation of China and recognising the independence of Manchukuo under Japanese protection. The Nanjing Government signed the Anti-Comintern Pact of 1941 and declared war on the United States and the United Kingdom on 9 January 1943.\nThe government had a strained relationship with the Japanese from the beginning. Wang's insistence on his regime being the true Nationalist government of China and in replicating all the symbols of the Kuomintang led to frequent conflicts with the Japanese, the most prominent being the issue of the regime's flag, which was identical to that of the Republic of China.\nThe worsening situation for Japan from 1943 onwards meant that the Nanjing Army was given a more substantial role in the defence of occupied China than the Japanese had initially envisaged. The army was almost continuously employed against the communist New Fourth Army. Wang Jingwei died on 10 November 1944, and was succeeded by his deputy, Chen Gongbo. Chen had little influence; the real power behind the regime was Zhou Fohai, the mayor of Shanghai. Wang's death dispelled what little legitimacy the regime had. On 9 September 1945, following the defeat of Japan, the area was surrendered to General He Yingqin, a nationalist general loyal to Chiang Kai-shek. Chen Gongbo was tried and executed in 1946.\nDenmark.\nDenmark was occupied by Germany after April 1940 and never joined the Axis. On 31 May 1939, Denmark and Germany signed a treaty of non-aggression, which did not contain any military obligations for either party. On April 9, Germany attacked Scandinavia, and the speed of the German invasion of Denmark prevented King Christian X and the Danish government from going into exile. They had to accept \"protection by the Reich\" and the stationing of German forces in exchange for nominal independence. Denmark coordinated its foreign policy with Germany, extending diplomatic recognition to Axis collaborator and puppet regimes, and breaking diplomatic relations with the Allied governments-in-exile. Denmark broke diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and signed the Anti-Comintern Pact in 1941. However the United States and Britain ignored Denmark and worked with Henrik Kauffmann Denmark's ambassador in the US when it came to dealings about using Iceland, Greenland, and the Danish merchant fleet against Germany.\nIn 1941 Danish Nazis set up the \"Frikorps Danmark\". Thousands of volunteers fought and many died as part of the German Army on the Eastern Front. Denmark sold agricultural and industrial products to Germany and made loans for armaments and fortifications. The German presence in Denmark included the construction of part of the Atlantic Wall fortifications which Denmark paid for and was never reimbursed.\nThe Danish protectorate government lasted until 29 August 1943, when the cabinet resigned after the regularly scheduled and largely free election concluding the Folketing's current term. The Germans imposed martial law following Operation Safari, and Danish collaboration continued on an administrative level, with the Danish bureaucracy functioning under German command. The Royal Danish Navy scuttled 32 of its larger ships; Germany seized 64 ships and later raised and refitted 15 of the sunken vessels. 13 warships escaped to Sweden and formed a Danish naval flotilla in exile. Sweden allowed formation of a Danish military brigade in exile; it did not see combat. The Danish resistance movement was active in sabotage and issuing underground newspapers and blacklists of collaborators.\nFinland.\nAlthough Finland never signed the Tripartite Pact, it fought against the Soviet Union alongside Germany in the 1941\u201344 Continuation War, during which the official position of the wartime Finnish government was that Finland was a co-belligerent of the Germans whom they described as \"brothers-in-arms\". Finland did sign the revived Anti-Comintern Pact of November 1941. Finland signed a peace treaty with the Allied powers in 1947 which described Finland as having been \"an ally of Hitlerite Germany\" during the continuation war. As such, Finland was the only democracy to join the Axis. Finland's relative independence from Germany put it in the most advantageous position of all the minor Axis powers. Finland was unusual in the Axis in its relative lack of participation in the Holocaust, and its lack of a fascist regime.\nWhilst Finland's relationship with Nazi Germany during the Continuation War remains controversial within Finland, in a 2008 survey of 28 Finnish historians, 16 agreed that Finland had been an ally of Nazi Germany, with only 6 disagreeing.\nThe August 1939 Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact between Germany and the Soviet Union contained a secret protocol dividing much of eastern Europe and assigning Finland to the Soviet sphere of influence. After unsuccessfully attempting to force territorial and other concessions on the Finns, the Soviet Union invaded Finland in November 1939, launching the Winter War, intending to establish a communist puppet government in Finland. The conflict threatened Germany's iron-ore supplies and offered the prospect of Allied interference in the region. Despite Finnish resistance, a peace treaty was signed in March 1940, wherein Finland ceded some key territory to the Soviet Union, including the Karelian Isthmus, containing Finland's second-largest city, Viipuri, and the critical defensive structure of the Mannerheim Line. After this war, Finland sought protection and support from the United Kingdom and non-aligned Sweden, but was thwarted by Soviet and German actions. This resulted in Finland being drawn closer to Germany, first with the intent of enlisting German support as a counterweight to thwart continuing Soviet pressure, and later to help regain lost territories.\nIn the opening days of Operation Barbarossa, Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union, Finland permitted German planes returning from mine dropping runs over Kronstadt and Neva River to refuel at Finnish airfields before returning to bases in East Prussia. In retaliation, the Soviet Union launched a major air offensive against Finnish Air Force bases and towns, which resulted in a Finnish declaration of war against the Soviet Union on 25 June 1941. The Finnish conflict with the Soviet Union is generally referred to as the Continuation War.\nFinland's main objective was to regain territory lost to the Soviet Union in the Winter War. However, on 10 July 1941, Field Marshal Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim issued an Order of the Day that contained a formulation understood internationally as a Finnish territorial interest in Russian Karelia.\nDiplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Finland were severed on 1 August 1941, after the British Royal Air Force bombed German forces in the Finnish village and port of Petsamo. The United Kingdom repeatedly called on Finland to cease its offensive against the Soviet Union, and declared war on Finland on 6 December 1941, although no other military operations followed. War was never declared between Finland and the United States, though relations were severed between the two countries in 1944 as a result of the Ryti-Ribbentrop Agreement.\nFinland maintained command of its armed forces and pursued war objectives independently of Germany. Germans and Finns did work closely together during Operation Silver Fox, a joint offensive against Murmansk. Finland took part in the Siege of Leningrad. Finland was one of Germany's most important allies in its war with the USSR.\nThe relationship between Finland and Germany was also affected by the Ryti-Ribbentrop Agreement, which was presented as a German condition for help with munitions and air support, as the Soviet offensive coordinated with D-Day threatened Finland with complete occupation. The agreement, signed by President Risto Ryti but never ratified by the Finnish Parliament, bound Finland not to seek a separate peace.\nAfter Soviet offensives were fought to a standstill, Ryti's successor as president, Marshal Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, dismissed the agreement and opened secret negotiations with the Soviets, which resulted in a ceasefire on 4 September and the Moscow Armistice on 19 September 1944. Under the terms of the armistice, Finland was obliged to expel German troops from Finnish territory, which resulted in the Lapland War.\nManchuria (Manchukuo).\nManchukuo, in the northeast region of China, had been a Japanese puppet state in Manchuria since the 1930s. It was nominally ruled by Puyi, the last Chinese Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, but was in fact controlled by the Japanese military, in particular the Kwantung Army. While Manchukuo ostensibly was a state for ethnic Manchus, the region had a Han Chinese majority.\nFollowing the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931, the independence of Manchukuo was proclaimed on 18 February 1932, with Puyi as head of state. He was proclaimed the Emperor of Manchukuo a year later. The new Manchu nation was recognized by 23 of the League of Nations' 80 members. Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union were among the major powers who recognised Manchukuo. Other countries who recognized the State were the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, and El Salvador. Manchukuo was also recognised by the other Japanese allies and puppet states, including Mengjiang, the Burmese government of Ba Maw, Thailand, the Wang Jingwei regime, and the Indian government of Subhas Chandra Bose. The League of Nations later declared in 1934 that Manchuria lawfully remained a part of China. This precipitated Japanese withdrawal from the League. The Manchukuoan state ceased to exist after the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in 1945.\nManchukuo signed the Anti-Comintern Pact in 1939, but never signed the Tripartite Pact.\nSpain.\nFrancisco Franco's dictatorship gave moral, economic, and military assistance to the Axis powers while nominally maintaining neutrality. Franco described Spain as a member of the Axis and signed the Anti-Comintern Pact in 1941 with Hitler and Mussolini. Members of the ruling Falange party in Spain held irredentist designs on Gibraltar. Falangists also supported Spanish colonial acquisition of the Tangier International Zone, French Morocco and northwestern French Algeria. In addition, Spain held ambitions on former Spanish colonies in Latin America. In June 1940 the Spanish government approached Germany to propose an alliance in exchange for Germany recognizing Spain's territorial aims: the annexation of the Oran Province of Algeria, the incorporation of all of Morocco, the extension of Spanish Sahara southward to the twentieth parallel, and the incorporation of French Cameroons into Spanish Guinea. Spain invaded and occupied the Tangier International Zone, maintaining its occupation until 1945. The occupation caused a dispute between Britain and Spain in November 1940; Spain conceded to protect British rights in the area and promised not to fortify the area. The Spanish government secretly held expansionist plans towards Portugal that it made known to the German government. In a communiqu\u00e9 with Germany on 26 May 1942, Franco declared that Portugal should be annexed into Spain.\nFranco had previously won the Spanish Civil War with the help of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Both were eager to establish another fascist state in Europe. Spain owed Germany over $212\u00a0million for supplies of mat\u00e9riel during the Spanish Civil War, and Italian Corpo Truppe Volontarie combat troops had actually fought in Spain on the side of Franco's Nationalists.\nWhen Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, Franco immediately offered to form a unit of military volunteers to join the invasion. This was accepted by Hitler and within two weeks there were more than enough volunteers to form the Blue Division (\"Divisi\u00f3n Azul\") under General Agust\u00edn Mu\u00f1oz Grandes.\nThe possibility of Spanish intervention in World War II was of concern to the United States, which investigated the activities of Spain's ruling Falange Espanola Tradicionalista y de las JONS in Latin America, especially Puerto Rico, where pro-Falange and pro-Franco sentiment was high, even amongst the ruling upper classes. The Falangists promoted the idea of supporting Spain's former colonies in fighting against American domination. Prior to the outbreak of war, support for Franco and the Falange was high in the Philippines. The Falange Exterior, the international department of the Falange, collaborated with Japanese forces against the United States Armed Forces and the Philippine Commonwealth Army in the Philippines through the Philippine Falange.\nBilateral pacts with the Axis powers.\nSome countries colluded with Germany, Italy, and Japan without signing either the Anti-Comintern Pact, or the Tripartite Pact. In some cases these bilateral agreements were formalised, in other cases it was less formal. Some of these countries were puppet states established by the Axis powers themselves.\nBurma (Ba Maw government).\nThe Japanese Army and Burma nationalists, led by Aung San, seized control of Burma from the United Kingdom during 1942. A State of Burma was formed on 1 August 1943 under the Burmese nationalist leader Ba Maw. A treaty of alliance was concluded between the Ba Maw regime and Japan was signed by Ba Maw for Burma and Sawada Renzo for Japan on the same day in which the Ba Maw government pledged itself to provide the Japanese \"with every necessary assistance in order to execute a successful military operation in Burma\". The Ba Maw government mobilised Burmese society during the war to support the Axis war-effort.\nThe Ba Maw regime established the Burma Defence Army (later renamed the Burma National Army), which was commanded by Aung San which fought alongside the Japanese in the Burma campaign. The Ba Maw has been described as a state having \"independence without sovereignty\" and as being effectively a Japanese puppet state. On 27 March 1945 the Burma National Army revolted against the Japanese.\nThailand.\nAs an ally of Japan during the war that deployed troops to fight on the Japanese side against Allied forces, Thailand is considered to have been part of the Axis alliance, or at least \"aligned with the Axis powers\". For example, writing in 1945, the American politician Clare Boothe Luce described Thailand as \"undeniably an Axis country\" during the war. \nThailand waged the Franco-Thai War in October 1940 to May 1941 to reclaim territory from French Indochina. Japanese forces invaded Thailand an hour and a half before the attack on Pearl Harbor (because of the International Dateline, the local time was on the morning of 8 December 1941). Only hours after the invasion, Prime Minister Field Marshal Phibunsongkhram ordered the cessation of resistance against the Japanese. An outline plan of Japan-Thailand joint military operations, whereby Thai forces would invade Burma to defend the right flank of Japanese forces, was agreed on 14 December 1941. On 21 December 1941, a military alliance with Japan was signed and on 25 January 1942, Sang Phathanothai read over the radio Thailand's formal declaration of war on the United Kingdom and the United States. The Thai ambassador to the United States, Mom Rajawongse Seni Pramoj, did not deliver his copy of the declaration of war. Therefore, although the British reciprocated by declaring war on Thailand and considered it a hostile country, the United States did not.\nThe Thais and Japanese agreed that the Burmese Shan State and Karenni State were to be under Thai control. The rest of Burma was to be under Japanese control. On 10 May 1942, the Thai Phayap Army entered Burma's eastern Shan State, which had been claimed by Siamese kingdoms. Three Thai infantry and one cavalry division, spearheaded by armoured reconnaissance groups and supported by the air force, engaged the retreating Chinese 93rd Division. Kengtung, the main objective, was captured on 27 May. Renewed offensives in June and November saw the Chinese retreat into Yunnan.\nIn November 1943 Thailand signed the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, formally aligning itself with the Axis powers. The area containing the Shan States and Kayah State was annexed by Thailand in 1942, and four northern states of Malaya were also transferred to Thailand by Japan as a reward for Thai co-operation. These areas were ceded back to Burma and Malaya in 1945. Thai military losses totalled 5,559 men during the war, of whom about 180 died resisting the Japanese invasion of 8 December 1941, roughly 150 died in action during the fighting in the Shan States, and the rest died of malaria and other diseases.\nThe Free Thai Movement (\"Seri Thai\") was established during these first few months. Parallel Free Thai organizations were also established in the United Kingdom. The king's aunt, Queen Rambai Barni, was the nominal head of the British-based organization, and Pridi Banomyong, the regent, headed its largest contingent, which was operating within Thailand. Aided by elements of the military, secret airfields and training camps were established, while American Office of Strategic Services and British Force 136 agents slipped in and out of the country.\nAs the war dragged on, the Thai population came to resent the Japanese presence. In June 1944, Phibun was overthrown in a coup d'\u00e9tat. The new civilian government under Khuang Aphaiwong attempted to aid the resistance while maintaining cordial relations with the Japanese. After the war, U.S. influence prevented Thailand from being treated as an Axis country, but the British demanded three million tons of rice as reparations and the return of areas annexed from Malaya during the war. Thailand also returned the portions of British Burma and French Indochina that had been annexed. Phibun and a number of his associates were put on trial on charges of having committed war crimes and of collaborating with the Axis powers. However, the charges were dropped due to intense public pressure. Public opinion was favourable to Phibun, as he was thought to have done his best to protect Thai interests.\nSoviet Union.\nIn 1939 the Soviet Union considered forming an alliance with either Britain and France or with Germany. When negotiations with Britain and France failed, they turned to Germany and signed the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact in August 1939. Germany was now freed from the risk of war with the Soviets, and was assured a supply of oil. This included a secret protocol whereby territories controlled by Poland, Finland, Estonia, Romania, Latvia and Lithuania were divided into spheres of interest of the parties. The Soviet Union sought to re-annex some of territories that were under control of those states, formerly acquired by the Russian Empire in the centuries prior and lost to Russia in the aftermath of World War I; that included land such as the Kresy (Western Belarus and Western Ukraine) region ceded to Poland after losing the Soviet-Polish War of 1919\u20131921.\nOn 1 September, barely a week after the pact had been signed, Germany invaded Poland. The Soviet Union invaded Poland from the east on 17 September and on 28 September signed a secret treaty with Nazi Germany to coordinate fighting against the Polish resistance. The Soviets targeted intelligence, entrepreneurs and officers with mass arrests, with many victims sent to the Gulag in Siberia, committing a string of atrocities that culminated in the Katyn massacre. Soon after the invasion of Poland, the Soviet Union occupied the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and annexed Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina from Romania. The Soviet Union attacked Finland on 30 November 1939, which started the Winter War. Finnish defenses prevented an all-out invasion, resulting in an interim peace, but Finland was forced to cede strategically important border areas near Leningrad.\nThe Soviet Union provided material support to Germany in the war effort against Western Europe through a pair of commercial agreements, the first in 1939 and the second in 1940, which involved exports of raw materials (phosphates, chromium and iron ore, mineral oil, grain, cotton, and rubber). These and other export goods transported through Soviet and occupied Polish territories allowed Germany to circumvent the British naval blockade. In October and November 1940, German\u2013Soviet talks about the potential of joining the Axis took place in Berlin. Joseph Stalin later personally countered with a separate proposal in a letter on 25 November that contained several secret protocols, including that \"the area south of Batum and Baku in the general direction of the Persian Gulf is recognized as the center of aspirations of the Soviet Union\", referring to an area approximating present day Iraq and Iran, and a Soviet claim to Bulgaria. Hitler never responded to Stalin's letter. Shortly thereafter, Hitler issued a secret directive on the invasion of the Soviet Union. Reasons included the Nazi ideologies of Lebensraum and Heim ins Reich\nVichy France.\nThe German army entered Paris on 14 June 1940, following the battle of France. P\u00e9tain became the last Prime Minister of the French Third Republic on 16 June 1940. He sued for peace with Germany and on 22 June 1940, the French government concluded an armistice with Hitler and Mussolini, which came into effect at midnight on 25 June. Under the terms of the agreement, Germany occupied two-thirds of France, including Paris. P\u00e9tain was permitted to keep an \"armistice army\" of 100,000 men within the unoccupied southern zone. This number included neither the army based in the French colonial empire nor the French Navy. In Africa the Vichy regime was permitted to maintain 127,000. The French also maintained substantial garrisons at the French-mandate territory of Syria and Greater Lebanon, the French colony of Madagascar, and in French Somaliland. Some members of the Vichy government pushed for closer cooperation, but they were rebuffed by P\u00e9tain. Neither did Hitler accept that France could ever become a full military partner, and constantly prevented the buildup of Vichy's military strength.\nAfter the armistice, relations between the Vichy French and the British quickly worsened. Although the French had told Churchill they would not allow their fleet to be taken by the Germans, the British launched naval attacks intended to prevent the French navy being used, the most notable of which was the attack on the Algerian harbour of Mers el-Kebir on 3 July 1940. Though Churchill defended his controversial decision to attack the French fleet, the action deteriorated greatly the relations between France and Britain. German propaganda trumpeted these attacks as an absolute betrayal of the French people by their former allies.\nOn 10 July 1940, P\u00e9tain was given emergency \"full powers\" by a majority vote of the French National Assembly. The following day approval of the new constitution by the Assembly effectively created the French State (\"l'\u00c9tat Fran\u00e7ais\"), replacing the French Republic with the government unofficially called \"Vichy France,\" after the resort town of Vichy, where P\u00e9tain maintained his seat of government. This continued to be recognised as the lawful government of France by the neutral United States until 1942, while the United Kingdom had recognised de Gaulle's government-in-exile in London. Racial laws were introduced in France and its colonies and many foreign Jews in France were deported to Germany. Albert Lebrun, last President of the Republic, did not resign from the presidential office when he moved to Vizille on 10 July 1940. By 25 April 1945, during P\u00e9tain's trial, Lebrun argued that he thought he would be able to return to power after the fall of Germany, since he had not resigned.\nIn September 1940, Vichy France was forced to allow Japan to occupy French Indochina, a federation of French colonial possessions and protectorates encompassing modern day Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. The Vichy regime continued to administer them under Japanese military occupation. French Indochina was the base for the Japanese invasions of Thailand, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies. On 26 September 1940, de Gaulle led an attack by Allied forces on the Vichy port of Dakar in French West Africa. Forces loyal to P\u00e9tain fired on de Gaulle and repulsed the attack after two days of heavy fighting, drawing Vichy France closer to Germany.\nDuring the Anglo-Iraqi War of May 1941, Vichy France allowed Germany and Italy to use air bases in the French mandate of Syria to support the Iraqi revolt. British and Free French forces attacked later Syria and Lebanon in June\u2013July 1941, and in 1942 Allied forces took over French Madagascar. More and more colonies abandoned Vichy, joining the Free French territories of French Equatorial Africa, Polynesia, New Caledonia and others who had sided with de Gaulle from the start.\nIn November 1942 Vichy French troops briefly resisted the landing of Allied troops in French North Africa for two days, until Admiral Fran\u00e7ois Darlan negotiated a local ceasefire with the Allies. In response to the landings, German and Italian forces invaded the non-occupied zone in southern France and ended Vichy France as an entity with any kind of autonomy; it then became a puppet government for the occupied territories. In June 1943, the formerly Vichy-loyal colonial authorities in French North Africa led by Henri Giraud came to an agreement with the Free French to merge with their own interim regime with the French National Committee (\"Comit\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ais National\", CFN) to form a provisional government in Algiers, known as the French Committee of National Liberation (\"Comit\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ais de Lib\u00e9ration Nationale\", CFLN) initially led by Darlan.\nIn 1943 the Milice, a paramilitary force which had been founded by Vichy, was subordinated to the Germans and assisted them in rounding up opponents and Jews, as well as fighting the French Resistance. The Germans recruited volunteers in units independent of Vichy. Partly as a result of the great animosity of many right-wingers against the pre-war Front Populaire, volunteers joined the German forces in their anti-communist crusade against the USSR. Almost 7,000 joined \"L\u00e9gion des Volontaires Fran\u00e7ais\" (LVF) from 1941 to 1944. The LVF then formed the cadre of the Waffen-SS Division \"Charlemagne\" in 1944\u20131945, with a maximum strength of some 7,500. Both the LVF and the \"Division Charlemagne\" fought on the eastern front.\nDeprived of any military assets, territory or resources, the members of the Vichy government continued to fulfil their role as German puppets, being quasi-prisoners in the so-called \"Sigmaringen enclave\" in a castle in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg at the end of the war in May 1945.\nIraq.\nIn April 1941 the Arab nationalist Rash\u012bd \u02bfAl\u012b al-Gayl\u0101n\u012b, who was pro-Axis, seized power in Iraq. British forces responded by deploying to Iraq and in turn removing Rashi Ali from power. During fighting between Iraqi and British forces, Axis forces were deployed to Iraq to support the Iraqis. However, Rashid Ali was never able to conclude a formal alliance with the Axis.\nAnti-British sentiments were widespread in Iraq prior to 1941. Rashid Ali al-Gaylani was appointed Prime Minister of Iraq in 1940. When Italy declared war on Britain, Rashid Ali had maintained ties with the Italians. This angered the British government. In December 1940, as relations with the British worsened, Rashid Ali formally requested weapons and military supplies from Germany. In January 1941 Rashid Ali was forced to resign as a result of British pressure.\nIn April 1941 Rashid Ali, on seizing power in a coup, repudiated the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930 and demanded that the British abandon their military bases and withdraw from the country.\nOn 9 May 1941, Mohammad Amin al-Husayni, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem who was an associate of Rashid Ali and in asylum in Iraq, declared Jihad against the British and called on Arabs throughout the Middle East to rise up against British rule. On 25 May 1941, the Germans stepped up offensive operations in the Middle East.\nHitler issued Order 30: \"The Arab Freedom Movement in the Middle East is our natural ally against England. In this connection special importance is attached to the liberation of Iraq\u00a0... I have therefore decided to move forward in the Middle East by supporting Iraq.\"\nHostilities between the Iraqi and British forces began on 2 May 1941, with heavy fighting at the RAF air base in Habbaniyah. The Germans and Italians dispatched aircraft and aircrew to Iraq utilizing Vichy French bases in Syria; this led to Australian, British, Indian and Free French forces entering and conquering Syria in June and July. With the advance of British and Indian forces on Baghdad, Iraqi military resistance ended by 31 May 1941. Rashid Ali and al-Husayn, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, fled to Iran, then Turkey, Italy, and finally Germany, where both were welcomed by Hitler and remained throughout the years of the war; Hitler considered Ali to be head of the Iraqi government-in-exile in Berlin.\nPuppet states.\nVarious nominally-independent governments formed out of local sympathisers under varying degrees of German, Italian, and Japanese control were established within the territories that they occupied during the war. Some of these governments declared themselves to be neutral in the conflict with the allies, or never concluded any formal alliance with the Axis powers, but their effective control by the Axis powers rendered them in reality an extension of it and hence part of it. These differed from military authorities and civilian commissioners provided by the occupying power in that they were formed from nationals of the occupied country, and that the supposed legitimacy of the puppet state was recognised by the occupier \"de jure\" if not \"de facto\".\nGerman.\nThe collaborationist administrations of German-occupied countries in Europe had varying degrees of autonomy, and not all of them qualified as fully recognized sovereign states. The General Government in occupied Poland was a fully German administration. In occupied Norway, the National Government headed by Vidkun Quisling \u2013 whose name came to symbolize pro-Axis collaboration in several languages \u2013 was subordinate to the Reichskommissariat Norwegen. It was never allowed to have any armed forces, be a recognized military partner, or have autonomy of any kind. In the occupied Netherlands, Anton Mussert was given the symbolic title of \"F\u00fchrer of the Netherlands' people\". His National Socialist Movement formed a cabinet assisting the German administration, but was never recognized as a real Dutch government.\nAlbania (Albanian Kingdom).\nAfter the Italian armistice, a vacuum of power opened up in Albania. The Italian occupying forces were rendered largely powerless, as the National Liberation Movement took control of the south and the National Front (Balli Komb\u00ebtar) took control of the north. Albanians in the Italian army joined the guerrilla forces. In September 1943 the guerrillas moved to take the capital of Tirana, but German paratroopers dropped into the city. Soon after the battle, the German High Command announced that they would recognize the independence of a greater Albania. They organized an Albanian government, police, and military in collaboration with the Balli Komb\u00ebtar. The Germans did not exert heavy control over Albania's administration, but instead attempted to gain popular appeal by giving their political partners what they wanted. Several Balli Komb\u00ebtar leaders held positions in the regime. The joint forces incorporated Kosovo, western Macedonia, southern Montenegro, and Presevo into the Albanian state. A High Council of Regency was created to carry out the functions of a head of state, while the government was headed mainly by Albanian conservative politicians. Albania was the only European country occupied by the Axis powers that ended World War II with a larger Jewish population than before the war. The Albanian government had refused to hand over their Jewish population. They provided Jewish families with forged documents and helped them disperse in the Albanian population. Albania was completely liberated on November 29, 1944.\nTerritory of the Military Commander in Serbia.\nThe Government of National Salvation, also referred to as the Nedi\u0107 regime, was the second Serbian puppet government, after the Commissioner Government, established on the Territory of the (German) Military Commander in Serbia during World War II. It was appointed by the German Military Commander in Serbia and operated from 29 August 1941 to October 1944. Although the Serbian puppet regime had some support, it was unpopular with a majority of Serbs who either joined the Yugoslav Partisans or Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107's Chetniks. The Prime Minister throughout was General Milan Nedi\u0107. The Government of National Salvation was evacuated from Belgrade to Kitzb\u00fchel, Germany in the first week of October 1944 before the German withdrawal from Serbia was complete.\nRacial laws were introduced in all occupied territories with immediate effects on Jews and Roma people, as well as causing the imprisonment of those opposed to Nazism. Several concentration camps were formed in Serbia and at the 1942 Anti-Freemason Exhibition in Belgrade the city was pronounced to be free of Jews (Judenfrei). On 1 April 1942, a Serbian Gestapo was formed. An estimated 120,000 people were interned in German-run concentration camps in Nedi\u0107's Serbia between 1941 and 1944. However the Banjica Concentration Camp was jointly run by the German Army and Nedic's regime. 50,000 to 80,000 were killed during this period. Serbia became the second country in Europe, following Estonia, to be proclaimed Judenfrei (free of Jews). Approximately 14,500 Serbian Jews \u2013 90 percent of Serbia's Jewish population of 16,000 \u2013 were murdered in World War II.\nNedi\u0107 was captured by the Americans when they occupied the former territory of Austria, and was subsequently handed over to the Yugoslav communist authorities to act as a witness against war criminals, on the understanding he would be returned to American custody to face trial by the Allies. The Yugoslav authorities refused to return Nedi\u0107 to United States custody. He died on 4 February 1946 after either jumping or falling out of the window of a Belgrade hospital, under circumstances which remain unclear.\nItaly (Italian Social Republic).\nItalian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini formed the Italian Social Republic (\"Repubblica Sociale Italiana\" in Italian) on 23 September 1943, succeeding the Kingdom of Italy as a member of the Axis.\nMussolini had been removed from office and arrested by King Victor Emmanuel III on 25 July 1943. After the Italian armistice, in a raid led by German paratrooper Otto Skorzeny, Mussolini was rescued from arrest.\nOnce restored to power, Mussolini declared that Italy was a republic and that he was the new head of state. He was subject to German control for the duration of the war.\nJoint German\u2013Italian client states.\nGreece (Hellenic State).\nFollowing the German invasion of Greece and the flight of the Greek government to Crete and then Egypt, the Hellenic State was formed in May 1941 as a puppet state of both Italy and Germany. Initially, Italy had wished to annex Greece, but was pressured by Germany to avoid civil unrest such as had occurred in Bulgarian-annexed areas. The result was Italy accepting the creation of a puppet regime with the support of Germany. Italy had been assured by Hitler of a primary role in Greece. Most of the country was held by Italian forces, but strategic locations (Central Macedonia, the islands of the northeastern Aegean, most of Crete, and parts of Attica) were held by the Germans, who seized most of the country's economic assets and effectively controlled the collaborationist government. The puppet regime never commanded any real authority, and did not gain the allegiance of the people. It was somewhat successful in preventing secessionist movements like the Aromanian Roman Legion from establishing themselves. By mid-1943, the Greek Resistance had liberated large parts of the mountainous interior (\"Free Greece\"), setting up a separate administration there. After the Italian armistice, the Italian occupation zone was taken over by the German armed forces, who remained in charge of the country until their withdrawal in autumn 1944. In some Aegean islands, German garrisons were left behind, and surrendered only after the end of the war.\nJapanese.\nThe Empire of Japan created a number of client states in the areas occupied by its military, beginning with the creation of Manchukuo in 1932. These puppet states achieved varying degrees of international recognition.\nCambodia.\nThe Kingdom of Kampuchea was a short-lived Japanese puppet state that lasted from 9 March 1945 to 15 August 1945. The Japanese entered the French protectorate of Cambodia in mid-1941, but allowed Vichy French officials to remain in administrative posts while Japanese calls for an \"Asia for the Asiatics\" won over many Cambodian nationalists.\nIn March 1945, in order to gain local support, the Japanese dissolved French colonial rule and pressured Cambodia to declare independence within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. King Sihanouk declared the Kingdom of Kampuchea (replacing the French name) independent. Son Ngoc Thanh who had fled to Japan in 1942 returned in May and was appointed foreign minister. On the date of Japanese surrender, a new government was proclaimed with Son Ngoc Thanh as prime minister. When the Allies occupied Phnom Penh in October, Son Ngoc Thanh was arrested for collaborating with the Japanese and was exiled to France.\nAzad Hind.\nThe \"Arzi Hukumat-e-Azad Hind\", the \"Provisional Government of Free India\" was a state that was recognized by nine Axis governments, and accepted as part of the axis by the Japanese.\nIt was led by Subhas Chandra Bose, an Indian nationalist who rejected Mahatma Gandhi's nonviolent methods for achieving independence. The First Indian National Army faltered after its leadership objected to being a propaganda tool for Japanese war aims, and the role of Japanese liaison office. It was revived by the Indian Independence League with Japanese support in 1942 after the ex-PoWs and Indian civilians in South-east Asia agreed to participate in the INA venture on the condition it was led by Bose. From occupied Singapore Bose declared India's independence on October 21, 1943 . The Indian National Army was committed as a part of the U Go Offensive. It played a largely marginal role in the battle, and suffered serious casualties and had to withdraw with the rest of Japanese forces after the siege of Imphal was broken. It was later committed to the defence of Burma against the Allied offensive. It suffered a large number of desertions in this latter part. The remaining troops of the INA maintained order in Rangoon after the withdrawal of Ba Maw's government. The provisional government was given nominal control of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands from November 1943 to August 1945.\nInner Mongolia (Mengjiang).\nMengjiang was a Japanese puppet state in Inner Mongolia. It was nominally ruled by Prince Demchugdongrub, a Mongol nobleman descended from Genghis Khan, but was in fact controlled by the Japanese military. Mengjiang's independence was proclaimed on 18 February 1936, following the Japanese occupation of the region.\nThe Inner Mongolians had several grievances against the central Chinese government in Nanjing, including their policy of allowing unlimited migration of Han Chinese to the region. Several of the young princes of Inner Mongolia began to agitate for greater freedom from the central government, and it was through these men that Japanese saw their best chance of exploiting Pan-Mongol nationalism and eventually seizing control of Outer Mongolia from the Soviet Union.\nJapan created Mengjiang to exploit tensions between ethnic Mongolians and the central government of China, which in theory ruled Inner Mongolia. When the various puppet governments of China were unified under the Wang Jingwei government in March 1940, Mengjiang retained its separate identity as an autonomous federation. Although under the firm control of the Japanese Imperial Army, which occupied its territory, Prince Demchugdongrub had his own independent army. Mengjiang vanished in 1945 following Japan's defeat in World War II.\nLaos.\nFrench Indochina, including Laos, had been occupied by the Japanese in 1941, though government by the Vichy French colonial officials had continued. The liberation of France in 1944, bringing Charles de Gaulle to power, meant the end of the alliance between Japan and the Vichy French administration in Indochina. On 9 March 1945 the Japanese staged a military coup in Hanoi, and on 8 April they reached Luang Phrabang. King S\u012bsav\u0101ngvong was detained by the Japanese, and forced to issue a declaration of independence, albeit one that does not appear to have ever been formalised. French control over Laos was re-asserted in 1946.\nPhilippines (Second Republic).\nAfter the surrender of the Filipino and American forces in Bataan Peninsula and Corregidor Island, the Japanese established a puppet state in the Philippines in 1942. The following year, the Philippine National Assembly declared the Philippines an independent Republic and elected Jos\u00e9 Laurel as its President. There was never widespread civilian support for the state, largely because of the general anti-Japanese sentiment stemming from atrocities committed by the Imperial Japanese Army. The Second Philippine Republic ended with Japanese surrender in 1945, and Laurel was arrested and charged with treason by the US government. He was granted amnesty by President Manuel Roxas, and remained active in politics, ultimately winning a seat in the post-war Senate.\nVietnam (Empire of Vietnam).\nThe Empire of Vietnam was a short-lived Japanese puppet state that lasted from 11 March to 23 August 1945. When the Japanese seized control of French Indochina, they allowed Vichy French administrators to remain in nominal control. This French rule ended on 9 March 1945, when the Japanese officially took control of the government. Soon after, Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i voided the 1884 treaty with France and Tr\u1ea7n Tr\u1ecdng Kim, a historian, became prime minister.\nGerman, Italian and Japanese cooperation.\nGerman\u2013Japanese Axis-cooperation.\nOn 7 December 1941, Japan attacked the US naval bases in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. According to the stipulation of the Tripartite Pact, Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy were required to come to the defense of their allies only if they were attacked. Since Japan had made the first move, Germany and Italy were not obliged to aid her until the United States counterattacked. Nevertheless, expecting the US to declare war on Germany in any event, Hitler ordered the \"Reichstag\" to formally declare war on the United States. Hitler had agreed that Germany would almost certainly declare war when the Japanese first informed him of their intention to go to war with the United States on 17 November 1941. Italy also declared war on the US.\nHistorian Ian Kershaw suggests that this declaration of war against the United States was a serious blunder made by Germany and Italy, as it allowed the United States to join the war in Europe and North Africa without any limitation. On the other hand, American destroyers escorting convoys had been effectively intervening in the Battle of the Atlantic with German and Italian ships and submarines, and the immediate war declaration made the Second Happy Time possible for U-boats. Franklin D. Roosevelt had said in his Fireside Chat on 9 December 1941, 2 days before the European Axis powers formally declared war on America, that Germany and Italy already considered themselves to be in a state of war with the United States. Plans for Rainbow Five had been published by the press early in December 1941, and Hitler could no longer ignore the amount of economic and military aid the US was giving Britain and the USSR.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nPrint sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "43508", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43508", "title": "Amen", "text": "Religious declaration of affirmation\nAmen is an Abrahamic declaration of affirmation which is first found in the Hebrew Bible, and subsequently found in the New Testament. It is used in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic practices as a concluding word, or as a response to a prayer. Common English translations of the word \"amen\" include \"verily\", \"truly\", \"it is true\", and \"let it be so\". It is also used colloquially to express strong agreement.\nPronunciations.\nIn English, the word \"amen\" has two primary pronunciations, () or (), with minor additional variation in emphasis (e.g., the two syllables may be equally stressed instead of placing primary stress on the second). In Anglophone North American usage, the \"ah-men\" pronunciation is used in performances of classical music and in churches with more formalized liturgy.\nThe \"ay-men\" pronunciation is a product of the Great Vowel Shift (i.e., it dates from the 15th century); it is associated with Irish Protestantism and with conservative evangelical denominations generally. It is also the pronunciation typically used in gospel music.\nEtymology.\n\"Amen\" is a word of Biblical Hebrew origin. It appears many times in the Hebrew Bible as a confirmatory response, especially following blessings. The basic triconsonantal root \u05d0-\u05de-\u05e0, from which the word is derived, is common to a number of languages in the Semitic branch of the Afroasiatic languages, including biblical Aramaic. Meanings of the root in Hebrew include \"to be firm or confirmed, to be reliable or dependable, to be faithful, to have faith, to believe.\" The word was imported into Greek from the Judaism of the early Church. From Greek, \"amen\" entered other European languages. According to a standard dictionary etymology of the English word, \"amen\" passed from Greek into Late Latin, and thence into English.\nFrom Hebrew \u05d0\u05b8\u05de\u05b5\u05df (\u02be\u0101m\u0113n), from the Semitic root \u05d0\u05be\u05de\u05be\u05e0 \u201cfirm, sure; reliable,\u201d used to express assent (\u201cso be it; truly\u201d).\nFrom Hebrew, the word was later adopted into the Arabic religious vocabulary and leveled to the Arabic root , which is of similar meanings to the Hebrew. The interjection occurs in the Christian and Islamic lexicons, most commonly in prayer, as well as secularly, albeit less commonly, so as to signify complete affirmation or deference. In religious texts, it occurs in Arabic translations of the Bible and after reciting the traditionally first chapter of the Quran, which is formally akin to religious supplications.\nPopular among some theosophists, proponents of Afrocentric theories of history, and adherents of esoteric Christianity is the conjecture that \"amen\" is a derivative of the name of the Egyptian god Amun (which is sometimes also spelled Amen). Some adherents of Eastern religions believe that \"amen\" shares roots with the Hindu Sanskrit word \"Aum\". Such external etymologies are not included in standard etymological reference works. The Hebrew word, as noted above, starts with aleph, while the Egyptian name begins with a yodh.\nIn French, the Hebrew word \"amen\" is sometimes translated as \"Ainsi soit-il\", which means \"So be it.\"\nThe linguist Ghil'ad Zuckermann argues that, as in the case of Hallelujah, the word \"amen\" is usually not replaced by a translation due to the speakers' belief in iconicity, their perception that there is something intrinsic about the relationship between the sound of the signifier (the word) and what it signifies (its meaning).\nHebrew Bible.\nThe word occurs in the Hebrew Bible 30 times; in Deuteronomy alone 12 times beginning at 27:15. The fixed phrase 'Amen, Amen' is seen five times \u2013 Psalm 41:13; 72:19; 89:52; Numbers 5:22; Nehemiah 8:6. It is translated as 'of truth' two times in Isaiah 65:16. Three distinct Biblical usages of \"amen\" may be noted:\nNew Testament.\nIn the New Testament, the Greek word \u1f00\u03bc\u03ae\u03bd is used as an expression of faith or as a part of a liturgical formula. It also may appear as an introductory word, especially in sayings of Jesus. Unlike the initial \"amen\" in Hebrew, which refers back to something already said, it is used by Jesus to emphasize what he is about to say (\u1f00\u03bc\u1f74\u03bd \u03bb\u03ad\u03b3\u03c9, \"truly I say to you\"), a rhetorical device that has no parallel in contemporary Jewish practice. Raymond Brown says that Jesus's peculiar and authentic reminiscent use of amen in the Fourth Gospel is an affirmation that what he is about to say is an echo from the Father. The word occurs 52 times in the Synoptic Gospels; the Gospel of John has 25.\nIn the New Testament of King James Bible, the word \"amen\" is seen in a number of contexts. Notable ones include:\nCongregational use.\nJudaism.\nAlthough amen, in Judaism, is commonly used as a response to a blessing, it also is often used by Hebrew speakers as an affirmation of other forms of declaration (including outside of religious context).\nJewish rabbinical law requires an individual to say \"amen\" in a variety of contexts. With the rise of the synagogue during the Second Temple period, \"amen\" became a common response, especially to benedictions. It is recited communally to affirm a blessing made by the prayer reader. It is also mandated as a response during the kaddish doxology. The congregation is sometimes prompted to answer \"amen\" by the terms \"ve-'imru\" () = \"and [now] say (pl.),\" or, \"ve-nomar\" (\u05d5\u05e0\u05d0\u05de\u05e8) = \"and we will say.\" Contemporary usage reflects ancient practice: As early as the 4th century BCE, Jews assembled in the Temple responded \"amen\" at the close of a doxology or other prayer uttered by a priest. This Jewish liturgical use of amen was adopted by the Christians. But Jewish law also requires individuals to answer \"amen\" whenever they hear a blessing recited, even in a non-liturgical setting.\nThe Talmud teaches homiletically that the word \"amen\" is an acronym for \u05d0\u05dc \u05de\u05dc\u05da \u05e0\u05d0\u05de\u05df (, \"God, trustworthy King\"), the phrase recited silently by an individual before reciting the Shma.\nJews usually use Hebrew pronunciations of the word: (Israeli and Sephardi) or (Ashkenazi).\nChristianity.\nThe use of \"amen\" has been generally adopted in Christian worship as a concluding word for prayers and hymns and an expression of strong agreement. The liturgical use of the word in apostolic times is attested (1 Corinthians 14:16), and Justin Martyr (c. 150) describes the congregation as responding \"amen\" to the benediction after the celebration of the Eucharist. Its introduction into the baptismal formula (in the Eastern Orthodox Church it is pronounced after the name of each person of the Trinity) was probably later.\nIn Isaiah 65:16, the authorized version has \"the God of truth\" (\"the God of amen\" in Hebrew). Jesus often used amen to put emphasis to his own words (translated: \"verily\" or \"truly\"). In John's Gospel, it is repeated, \"Verily, verily\" (or \"Truly, truly\"). Amen is also used in oaths (Numbers 5:22; Deuteronomy 27:15\u201326; Nehemiah 5:13; 8:6; 1 Chronicles 16:36).\n\"Amen\" is also used in standard, international French, but in Cajun French \"\" (\"so be it\") is used instead.\nAmen is used at the end of the Lord's Prayer, which is also called the Our Father or the \"Pater Noster\".\nIn some Christian churches, the \"amen corner\" or \"amen section\" is any subset of the congregation likely to call out \"Amen!\" in response to points in a preacher's sermon. Metaphorically, the term can refer to any group of heartfelt traditionalists or supporters of an authority figure. The term has also been used as a place name, and as a title for musical and literary works; see \"Amen Corner\".\nIslam.\n\"\u02be\u0100m\u012bn\" () is the Arabic form of \"Amen\". In Islam, it is used with the same meaning as in Judaism and Christianity; when concluding a prayer, especially after a supplication (du'a) or reciting the first surah Al Fatiha of the Qur'an, as in prayer (salat), and as an assent to the prayers of others.\nArabic dictionaries define \"\u02be\u0101m\u012bn\" as an imperative verbal noun, whose meaning is \"answer\" or \"reply\" (i.e., imploring God to grant one's prayer). The word was borrowed from Hebrew into Arabic in only this context, thus it is strictly used in Arabic as a final \"amen\" to conclude supplications or to declare affirmation, and has no initial \"amen\" usage with the meaning of \"truly\" or \"certainly\" as found in the word\u2019s original Hebrew language grammar.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "43513", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43513", "title": "Rhodes piano", "text": "Electric piano\nThe Rhodes piano (also known as the Fender Rhodes piano) is an electric piano invented by Harold Rhodes, which became popular in the 1970s. Like a conventional piano, the Rhodes generates sound with keys and hammers, but instead of strings, the hammers strike thin metal tines, which vibrate next to an electromagnetic pickup. The signal is sent through a cable to an external keyboard amplifier and speaker.\nThe instrument evolved from Rhodes's attempt to manufacture pianos while teaching recovering soldiers during World War II. Development continued after the war and into the following decade. In 1959, Fender began marketing the Piano Bass, a cut-down version; the full-size instrument did not appear until after Fender's sale to CBS in 1965. CBS oversaw mass production of the Rhodes piano in the 1970s, and it was used extensively through the decade, particularly in jazz, pop, and soul music, as well by many rock artists. It was less used in the 1980s because of competition with polyphonic and digital synthesizers such as the Yamaha DX7 and inconsistent quality control caused by cost-cutting.\nIn 1987, the company was sold to Roland, which manufactured digital versions of the piano, to Harold Rhodes' criticism. In the 1990s, the Rhodes piano underwent a resurgence in popularity, resulting in Rhodes re-obtaining the rights in 1997. Though Harold Rhodes died in 2000, the Rhodes piano has been reissued and his teaching methods are still in use.\nFeatures.\nThe Rhodes piano's keyboard is laid out like a traditional acoustic piano, but some models contain 73 keys instead of 88. The 73-key model weighs around . The keyboard's touch and action is designed to be like an acoustic piano. Pressing a key results in a hammer striking a thin metal rod called a tine connected to a larger \"tone bar\". The tone generator assembly acts as a tuning fork as the tone bar reinforces and extends the tine's vibrations. A pickup sits opposite the tine, inducing an electric current from the vibrations like an electric guitar. Simply hitting tines does not need an external power supply, and a Rhodes will make sound even when not plugged into an amplifier, though like an unplugged electric guitar, the volume level and tone will be diminished.\nThe Suitcase model Rhodes includes a built-in power amplifier and a tremolo feature that bounces the output signal from the piano across two speakers. This feature is inaccurately labeled \"vibrato\" (which is a variation in pitch) on some models to be consistent with the labelling on Fender amplifiers.\nAlthough the Rhodes functions mechanically like a piano, its sound is very different. Vibrating tines produce a mellower timbre, and the sound changes with the tine's relative position to the pickup. Putting the two close together gives a characteristic \"bell\" sound. The instrument has been compared with the Wurlitzer electronic piano, which uses a similar technology, but with the hammers striking metal reeds. The Rhodes has a better sustain, while the Wurlitzer produces significant harmonics when the keys are played hard, giving it a \"bite\". According to Benjamin Love of Retro Rentals, an equalization spectrum analysis of the instrument will have a gap where the frequency of a lead vocal can be. This means the instrument can easily support a voice performance without overpowering it.\nHistory.\nEarly models: Xylette, Pre-Piano (\"Bantam Piano\") and Piano Bass.\nHarold Rhodes started teaching piano when he was 19. He dropped out of the University of Southern California in 1929 to support his family through the Great Depression by full-time teaching. He designed a method that combined classical and jazz music, which became popular across the United States, and led to an hour-long nationally syndicated radio show. Rhodes continued to teach piano throughout his lifetime, and his piano method continues to be taught today. He continually refined and updated the design of the instrument up to 1984.\nBy 1942, Rhodes was in the Army Air Corps, where he created a piano teaching method to provide therapy for soldiers recovering from combat in hospital. From scrapped airplanes, he eventually developed miniature pianos that could be played in bed. He was discharged from the Army Air Corps in September 1944. He named his (non-amplified) lap instrument the \"Xylette\", and a 1945 newspaper described its materials and their source: \"The Xylette is being constructed by patients in the craft shops of the convalescent hospitals. The [aluminum] xylophone bars are made from discarded hydraulic systems, the plywood from hatchways, keys from the fuselage spruce, and hammers from the hardwood of the propellor.\"\nOn March 18, 1945, Rhodes visited the Santa Ana Army Base Convalescent Hospital, in Santa Ana, California, bringing with him eight Xylettes, and having visited seven similar military hospitals across the U.S. When Rhodes had visited the Army's Fort Logan convalescent hospital, in Fort Logan, Colorado, a month earlier, he supervised construction of Xylettes and provided instruction, noting that \"exercise afforded by a keyboard instrument is effective in the restoration of neuro-muscular coordination of fingers, hands and arms\". A \"Popular Mechanics\" article in June 1945 pictured recovering veterans playing their Xylettes at the Army's Ft. Thomas convalescent hospital, in Fort Thomas, Kentucky.\nRhodes, in California, next developed an electrically-amplified 38-key instrument, again without strings\u2014instead, using carbon steel rods and advertised as \"never needing to be tuned\". It was labeled the \"Pre-Piano\", also being advertised as the \"Bantam Piano\" to broaden its appeal. Its public debut was in Los Angeles on May 21, 1948, at the Broadway department store. Rhodes was present as demonstrator, as was songwriter Jimmy McHugh; by that date, Rhodes had built 100 of the instruments in his factory space at 2370 E. Foothill Blvd. in Pasadena. \nBy mid-1948 the Pre-Piano was being used for teaching in the Los Angeles public school system, and was eventually adopted in other cities, including Chicago. Among Rhodes's promotional appearances away from Los Angeles was Chicago's Lyon &amp; Healy music store, where he demonstrated the instrument between July 21 and 23, 1948. In mid-1948 pianist and song-stylist Gwen Bari was Rhodes's representative and demonstrator in Philadelphia,\u2014including a local television broadcast. She likewise appeared for promotions in Cleveland, New York, and Chicago. Her husband and violinist-partner Gene Bari was Rhodes's sales agent in Palm Springs (CA), advertising the instrument at $189.50 with amplification either built into the instrument or as an outboard unit, though it \"also plays without amplification\". The instrument weighed twenty pounds by itself, and thirty pounds including its tubular base with attached seat, and the Baris were then using it in performances at Palm Springs' Desert Inn.\nIn 1958, Rhodes began a business affiliation with Leo Fender to manufacture instruments. For Fender, Rhodes developed a 32-note keyboard bass approximating the string bass's range (E1-B3), known as the Piano Bass. The instrument introduced the design that would become common to subsequent Rhodes pianos, with the same Tolex body as Fender amplifiers and a fiberglass top. The tops came from a boat manufacturer who supplied whatever color happened to be available; consequently a number of different colored piano basses were produced.\nSome recent, undocumented sources place Piano Bass manufacture as early as 1959. Actual production (for retail sale) in Fender's Fullerton plant, however, began early in 1962\u2014following manufacture of prototypes that \"[had then] been in use throughout the Southwest for more than a year\". The earliest-known national advertisement for the instrument was in Down Beat's July 1962 issue.\nUnder CBS.\nFender was bought by CBS in 1965. Rhodes stayed with the company, and released the first Fender Rhodes piano, a 73-note model. The instrument comprised parts\u00a0\u2014 the piano, and a separate enclosure underneath containing the power amplifier and loudspeaker. Like the piano bass, it was finished in black Tolex, and had a fiberglass top. During the late 1960s, two models of the Fender Rhodes Celeste also became available, which used the top three or four octaves, respectively, of the Fender Rhodes piano. The Celeste did not sell well and is now hard to find. In 1969, the fiberglass lid was replaced with vacuum-molded plastic; the earlier models became known retrospectively as \"silvertops\".\nThe Student and Instructor models were introduced in 1965. They were designed to teach the piano in the classroom. By connecting the output of a network of student models, the teacher could listen to each student in isolation on the instructor model, and send an audio backing track to them. This allowed the teacher to monitor individual students' progress. Production of educational models ceased in 1974.\nIn 1970, the 73-note Stage Piano was introduced as a lighter () and more portable alternative to the existing two-piece style, featuring four detachable legs (used in Fender steel pedal guitars), a sustain pedal derived from a Rogers hi-hat stand and a single output jack. Although the Stage could be used with any amplifier, catalogs suggested the use of the Fender Twin Reverb. The older style piano continued to be sold alongside the Stage and was renamed the Suitcase Piano. An 88-note model was introduced in 1971.\nThe Rhodes became increasingly popular during the 1970s. In 1976, the company posted an advertisement claiming that of the top 100 \"Billboard\" albums featuring electric pianos, 82% of them used a Rhodes.\nLater models.\nDuring the 1970s various changes were made to the Rhodes mechanics. In 1971 the hammer tips were changed to neoprene rubber instead of felt, to avoid the excessive need for regular maintenance, while in 1975 harp supports were changed from wood to aluminum. Although this made production cheaper, it changed the resonance of the instrument slightly. In 1977 the power amplifier design was changed from an 80 to a 100-watt model. The Mk II model was introduced in late 1979, which was simply a set of cosmetic changes over the most recent Mk I models. A 54-note model was added to the range.\nThe Rhodes Mk III EK-10 was a combination electric piano and synthesizer, introduced in 1980 before CBS bought ARP Instruments in 1981. It used analog oscillators and filters alongside the existing electromechanical elements. The overall effect was that of a Rhodes piano and a synthesizer being played simultaneously. The instrument was unreliable with a problematic production, particularly when a shipment of 150 units to Japan caused interference with local television reception. Compared to the new polyphonic synthesizers being marketed at the same time, it was limited in scope and sound, and very few units were sold.\nThe final Rhodes produced by the original company was the Mk V in 1984. Among other improvements, it had a lighter plastic body and an improved action that varied the dynamics with each note. The Mark V is the easiest of the original Rhodes pianos for touring musicians to transport. Rhodes pianos produced under the original run had an inconsistent quality as the company wanted to mass-produce the instrument.\nDuring the late 1970s and 1980s, Chuck Monte manufactured an after-market modification to the Rhodes, known as Dyno My Piano. It included a lever that moved the relative position of the tines to the pickups, modifying the sound, and fed the output signal through additional electronics. This sound was emulated by the Yamaha DX7 with a patch known as the DX7 Rhodes that was popular during the 1980s, and caused several players to abandon the Rhodes in favor of the DX7.\nAfter CBS.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIt\u2019s impossible to reinvent an instrument as iconic as the Rhodes piano. So we\u2019re not going to try.\nMatt Pelling of Rhodes Music Group, as quoted by Mark Gilbert of \"Jazz Journal\" (October 8, 2024) https://\nIn 1983, Rhodes was sold to CBS boss William Schultz, who closed the main factory in 1985 and sold the business to the Japanese corporation Roland in 1987. Roland introduced digital pianos known as the Rhodes MK80 and MK60 in 1989, and were essentially re-engineered versions of Roland's own RD-1000 (which they closely resembled), but Harold Rhodes disapproved of the instruments, which were made without his consultation.\nRhodes re-acquired the rights to the Rhodes piano in 1997. By then, he was in ill health and died in December 2000. In 2007, his former business partner Joe Brandstetter acquired the rights to the name and re-formed Rhodes Music Corporation. The company introduced a reproduction of the original electric piano, the Rhodes Mark 7, housed in a molded plexiglass enclosure. \nIn 2021, a new company, Rhodes Music Group Ltd, was formed by the audio company Loopmasters who licensed the trademark rights from Brandstetter. They announced a new model, the MK8, in development. The MK8 was made available for pre-order in November with 500 units planned for production in 2022. The MK8's case was designed by Axel Hartmann and its electronics were designed by former Moog Music technician Cyril Lance. At , it is significantly lighter than earlier models.\nNotable users.\nDoors keyboardist Ray Manzarek began using Rhodes instruments when the group formed in 1965. He played basslines on a Piano Bass with his left hand, while playing organ with his right. He also played a full-sized Rhodes in the studio, such as a Mark I Stage 73 on \"Riders on the Storm\". According to Manzarek, \"If Mr. Rhodes hadn't created the keyboard bass, the Doors would never have existed.\"\nThe Rhodes piano became a popular instrument in jazz in the late 1960s, particularly for several sidemen who played with Miles Davis. Herbie Hancock first encountered the Rhodes in 1968 while booked for a session with Davis. He immediately became an enthusiast, noting that the amplification made him much more audible in groups when compared to the piano. Hancock continued to experiment with the Rhodes over the following years, including playing it through a wah-wah. Other former Davis sidemen Chick Corea and Joe Zawinul started using the Rhodes prominently during the 1970s. Beginning with \"In a Silent Way\" (1969), the Rhodes became the most prominent keyboard on Davis's recordings until the mid-1970s.\nVince Guaraldi started using a Rhodes in 1968, and toured with both an acoustic piano and a Rhodes. He achieved particular prominence with his soundtrack music for \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\" and other \"Peanuts\"/\"Charlie Brown\" films.\nBilly Preston was described as the \"Ruler of the Rhodes\" by \"Music Radar\"; he played Rhodes during the Beatles' rooftop concert in 1969, and on the Beatles' hit single \"Get Back\". Many of Stevie Wonder's recordings from the 1970s, such as \"You Are the Sunshine of My Life\" feature him playing the Rhodes. He often used one alongside the Hohner Clavinet. Donny Hathaway regularly used the Rhodes; his hit single, \"This Christmas\", which receives seasonal radio play on African American stations, makes a prominent use of the instrument. Although better known for playing the Wurlitzer, Ray Charles played a Rhodes on his performance of \"Shake a Tailfeather\" in the film \"The Blues Brothers\".\nDonald Fagen of Steely Dan has regularly used the Rhodes. He has also used the Rhodes in all his solo albums and has played it at every one of his touring performances since 1994. The Rhodes features in \"Angela\", the 1978 instrumental theme from the sitcom \"Taxi\" by Bob James. The French band Air make regular use of the Rhodes piano in their recordings. German pianist and composer Nils Frahm uses a Rhodes piano extensively in his studio and live performances.

The aerodrome is located northeast of Northampton and was originally opened in 1928 on the edge of Sywell village.\nThe aerodrome caters for private flying, flight training and corporate flights. There is a fixed-wing flying school, a microlight school and a helicopter school. The 1930s Art Deco hotel (built in 1934 as the Northamptonshire Aero Club clubhouse) has bar and restaurant facilities. Aviation related industries and businesses are also located at the aerodrome. A viewing area is provided for aircraft spotters where the airfield memorial is located. The Pilots' Mess cafe is also located on site and the large Hangar One venue hosts many events throughout the year.\nSecond World War.\nThe aerodrome opened in 1928 and during the Second World War the aerodrome, as RAF Sywell, was used as a training facility (de Havilland Tiger Moths) and later an important centre for the repair of Vickers Wellington bombers; extensive sheds from this time still remain on the site. Sywell also produced nearly 100 Avro Lancasters from 1942 to 1943. Among the Second World War pilots who underwent training at Sywell were Pierre Clostermann and Paddy Finucane, who soloed here.\nThe following units were here at some point:\nAerial shots for the film \"Battle of Britain\" were taken over the airport and nearby area.\nExpansion.\nIn 1999, the aerodrome sought planning permission for a hard runway, which was intended to allow operations to continue over the winter, when the grass runways often become waterlogged. The organisations STARE (Stop The Aerodrome Runway Expansion) and CPRE (Campaign to Protect Rural England) campaigned against this change, arguing that it would lead to more and larger aircraft flying over the area and disturb its \"rural tranquility\".\nPermission was granted for the runway on 22 November 2007 by the Department for Transport, and though campaigners vowed to fight the decision they were unsuccessful and construction of the runway began in 2008. It opened during summer 2009 and enabled safe operations during the winter of 2009\u20132010 and onwards. In February 2010, the final inspection of the newly completed all-weather hard runway was carried out by the CAA who confirmed that it could be licensed for use. In recent years airfield lighting and approach aids have been installed to enable night training and operations to be carried out albeit at present this is infrequent.\nOperations.\nSywell has two all-grass operational runways and a third all-weather concrete runway. The aerodrome's operational hours are 0900\u20131700 during winter and 0800-1700 during summer. The aerodrome offers an Aerodrome Flight Information Service to pilots. The tower frequency is 122.705 mhz. Non Sywell-based aircraft are required to PPR (Prior Permission Required). \nThe Aerodrome provides fuel ( JET A1, AVGAS 100LL &amp; MOGAS) inside and outside operating hours (the latter self-service) and has a Category 1 (CAT 1) Rescue &amp; Fire Service (RFFS) during operating hours equipped with Land Rover and Dodge Ram appliances. \nSywell Aviation Museum.\nIn 2000, construction began on the Sywell Aviation Museum. It was completed in 2001 and opened by Alex Henshaw who had test-flown Vickers Wellingtons on the site during the Second World War. The Museum contains many artefacts and models telling the story of the site and the airmen who served there. Originally it comprised three Nissen huts, it was expanded from 2010 to 2012. with the addition of two more Nissen huts, and, in the summer of 2012, the museum acquired a Hawker Hunter airframe.\nIn March 2021 the Museum acquired its second complete aircraft 1969 built Handley Page Jetstream 200 G-RAVL. Jetstream aircraft were built at Sywell Aerodrome from 1971 to 1972 and this machine was not only the parent company (Jetstream Ltd) demonstrator but also won the Daily Express National Air Race Challenge Cup on 12 June 1971 in a race from Sywell to Biggin Hill which was televised on the BBC.\nThe Museum is a volunteer-run charitable trust and entry is free. It opens between Easter and September on weekends and bank holidays.\nThe Aviator Hotel.\nThe original 1930s Clubhouse was developed over the years, becoming a 'motel' in the 1960s. By the late 1990s the building was restored to its Art Deco glory and a further accommodation block added in a similar architectural style. The 3 star hotel now boasts 50 en suite rooms, a bar and restaurant and several function rooms. The Clubhouse, The Cockpit and The Briefing Room are small meeting rooms often used by local clubs and societies. The Cirrus Room is larger and caters for small events and weddings. Hangar One is a large function space with its own bar and dancefloor which caters for larger corporate events, fairs and weddings.\nRegular events at the aerodrome include car festivals, the 'Pistons and Props' show in September (AKA 'The Sywell Classic'), craft fairs, balls, weddings, rallies, fly ins, and 'car experience' days by 'Car Chase Heroes'.\nThe Pilots' Mess Cafe \nLocated adjacent to the control tower the cafe provides food and drink to visitors.\nBrooklands Flying Club.\nBrooklands Flying Club was based at Sywell, with a fleet of four Aero AT-3 aircraft and a Cessna 172. Two of the AT-3s are now operated by Cabaero - see below.\nThe club opened in 2005 under the same name of the previous company that had been located on the airfield but closed in 2021.\nThe Northamptonshire School of Flying (NSF) was formerly based at Sywell moved to Sibson, Cambs in the 2000s and rebranded as Peterborough Aero Club.\nBrooklands Engineering.\nBrooklands Engineering was formed in October 2005 as an EASA approved Part-145 and PART-ML (Part-CAO) Maintenance organisation. It ceased trading in 2023.\nBrooklands Executive Air Travel.\nBEAT briefly operated a Piper PA-31 Chieftain G-SYLL for executive charter from the aerodrome.\nTraining &amp; Sales.\nOther flight training/maintenance organisations on the airfield include:\nThe Blades.\nThe Blades aerobatic display team were based at Sywell, where their five Extra EA-300 aircraft were hangared. They performed aerobatic displays at major events around the country, in Europe, and in the Middle East. The team was the only one fully licensed by the CAA to carry paying 'passengers' in aerobatic displays, out of Sywell, or at many other locations.\nIn January 2023, the Blades announced that their 2022 season was their last and that they would be disbanding after 17 years of operations. \n2 Excel, the parent company of the Blades, also have subsidiary businesses at the aerodrome and under the 2Excel Broadsword banner operate air charter services with types ranging from a Beech King Air to a Boeing 737. They also undertake work for the UK Government most especially the UK Maritime &amp; Coastguard Agency and Oil Spill Response using a modified Boeing 727 aircraft.\nAir Leasing/Ultimate Warbirds.\nIn January 2016, Air Leasing Ltd, operators of the famous 'Grace Spitfire'- Supermarine Spitfire TR.9 ML407 'OU-V' moved to Sywell Aerodrome. Initially based in a single new build 'blister' type hangar named 'The Spitfire Blister' but known locally as 'Graceland' \u2013 they have now expanded to fill two more. AL specialise in the maintenance and restoration of vintage 'warbird' type aircraft such as the Spitfire, Hurricane, P-51 Mustang and Sea Fury.\nA subsidiary, Ultimate Warbird Flights, operate several two-seat warbirds for trial experience flights in Spitfire, Mustang, and Hispano Buchon aircraft. Four of the resident warbirds operate as the Ultimate Fighters display team \u2013 usually displaying Mustang, Spitfire, Hispano Buchon and Thunderbolt aircraft across the UK and Europe.\nSywell Airshow.\nThe Aerodrome has hosted many airshows and fly ins over the years. \nFrom 2004-2014 it hosted a bi-enniel charity airshow in aid of the local Air Ambulance where there were many classic aircraft flying and on display such as the Consolidated Catalina, North American P-51 Mustang, North American Harvards. The airshow is no longer hosted as of 2016, after the Shoreham Airshow crash. On 6 November 2020 flying legends announced its signature airshow, previously held at the IWM Duxford, would now transfer to Sywell Aerodrome. Cancelled in 2020 &amp; 2021 due to COVID, the show was due to take place in 2022 but was subsequently also cancelled,\nThe Sywell Airshow 2024 took place on the 22 and 23 June.\nAfter the passing of principal organiser Richard Grace in 2024, it was announced that the show would not be returning in 2025 but an airshow 'in another form' may take place in the future.\nLight Aircraft Association Rally.\nThe Light Aircraft Association (LAA \u2013 formerly the Popular Flying Association), is one of the UK's several bodies supporting amateur aircraft construction, and recreational and sport flying. It used to hold its annual rally at Cranfield Airport, and then at Kemble Airport. In 2006, the LAA lost so much money through poor attendances resulting from poor weather that in 2007 and 2008, much smaller (and cheaper) \"regional rallies\" were held. These were unpopular and in September 2009 a revived LAA Rally was held at Sywell. This proved successful, and further well-attended rallies have taken place at Sywell since.\nIn recent years the LAA Rally has been held at other locations in the UK.\nPrevious events and users.\nMusic in Flight was held at Sywell in the early 21st century. This combined orchestral music classical music with flying aircraft, hot air balloons, the Red Devils parachute display team and a fireworks display. The event subsequently moved to Biggin Hill.\nPrevious 'aviation experience' users of the aerodrome were Virgin Balloons, Warbird Experiences and Delta Aviation.\nBusiness park.\nAn industrial area in the complex accommodates firms, agencies and other commercial businesses. Some 138 business were registered as being based at the Aerodrome in 2025.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "43521", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43521", "title": "The Three Little Pigs", "text": "Fairy tale\n\"The Three Little Pigs\" is a fable about three pigs who build their houses of different materials. A Big Bad Wolf blows down the first two pigs' houses which are made of straw and sticks respectively, but is unable to destroy the third pig's house that is made of bricks. The printed versions of this fable date back to the 1840s, but the story is thought to be much older. The earliest version takes place in Dartmoor with three pixies and a fox before its best known version appears in \"English Fairy Tales\" by Joseph Jacobs in 1890, with Jacobs crediting James Halliwell-Phillipps as the source. In 1886, Halliwell-Phillipps had published his version of the story, in the fifth edition of his \"Nursery Rhymes of England\", and it included, for the first time in print, the now-standard phrases \"not by the hair of my chiny chin chin\" and \"I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in\".\nThe phrases used in the story, and the various morals drawn from it, have become embedded in Western culture. Many versions of \"The Three Little Pigs\" have been recreated and modified over the years, sometimes making the wolf a kind character. It is a type B124 folktale in the Thompson Motif Index.\nTraditional versions.\n\"The Three Little Pigs\" was included in \"The Nursery Rhymes of England\" (London and New York, c.1886), by James Halliwell-Phillipps. The story in its arguably best-known form appeared in \"English Fairy Tales\" by Joseph Jacobs, first published on June 19, 1890, and crediting Halliwell as his source. The earliest published version of the story is from Dartmoor, Devon, England in 1853, and has three little pixies and a fox in place of the three pigs and a wolf. The first pixy had a wooden house:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe story begins with the title characters being sent out into the world by their mother, to \"seek out their fortune\". The first little pig builds a house out of straw, but the wolf blows it down and devours him. The second little pig builds a house out of sticks, but the result is the same. Each exchange between wolf and pig features ringing proverbial phrases, namely:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe third little pig builds a house out of bricks, which the wolf fails to blow down. The wolf then attempts to meet the pig at a turnip field, an apple orchard, and a fair, but the pig always arrives early and avoids the wolf. Finally, the infuriated wolf resolves to come down the chimney, whereupon the pig lights a fire under a pot of water on the fireplace. The wolf falls in and is fatally boiled, avenging the death of his brothers. After cooking the wolf, the pig proceeds to eat him for dinner.\nOther versions.\nIn some versions, the first two pigs escape to their brother's brick house. Most such versions omit any attempts by the wolf to meet the third pig after his failed attempt to blow the house in. Sometimes, the wolf simply burns his tail and runs away.\nThe story uses the literary rule of three, expressed in this case as a \"contrasting three\", as the third pig's brick house turns out to be the only one which is adequate to withstand the wolf.\nVariations of the tale appeared in \"Uncle Remus: His Songs and His Sayings\" in 1881, in which the pigs were replaced by Br'er Rabbit. The story also made an appearance in \"Nights with Uncle Remus\" in 1883, both by Joel Chandler Harris. Andrew Lang included it in \"The Green Fairy Book\", published in 1892, but did not cite his source. In contrast to Jacobs's version, which left the pigs nameless, Lang's retelling cast the pigs as Browny, Whitey, and Blacky. It also set itself apart by exploring each pig's character and detailing the interaction between them. The antagonist of this version is a fox, not a wolf. The pigs' houses are made either of mud, cabbage, or brick. Blacky, the third pig, rescues his brother and sister from the fox's den after the fox has been defeated.\nAnalysis.\nWriter Bruno Bettelheim, in his book \"The Uses of Enchantment\", interprets the tale as a showcase of the capacity for anticipation and courage in the face of adversity, symbolized by the wolf. According to him, the individual who is content to prepare themself as the first two pigs will be destroyed by the vicissitudes of life, and only a person who builds a solid base can face such hazards. He viewed the tale as a means of telling children that one cannot always act according to the pleasure principle, and must submit to the reality principle when life demands it. He exemplified this point by observing that the first two pigs valued gratification rather than planning and foresight as the third pig had.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Mon, like the related Khmer language, but unlike most languages in mainland Southeast Asia, is not tonal. The Mon language is a recognised indigenous language in Myanmar as well as an indigenous language of Thailand.\nMon was classified as a \"vulnerable\" language in UNESCO's 2010 \"Atlas of the World\u2019s Languages in Danger\". The Mon language has faced assimilative pressures in both Myanmar and Thailand, where many individuals of Mon descent are now monolingual in Burmese or Thai respectively. In 2007, Mon speakers were estimated to number between 1,800,000 and 2 million. In Myanmar, the majority of Mon speakers live in Southern Myanmar, especially Mon State, followed by Tanintharyi Region and Kayin State.\nHistory.\nMon is an important language in Burmese history. Until the 12th century, it was the lingua franca of the Irrawaddy valley\u2014not only in the Mon kingdoms of the lower Irrawaddy but also of the upriver Pagan Kingdom of the Bamar people. Mon, especially written Mon, continued to be a prestige language even after the fall of the Mon kingdom of Thaton to Pagan in 1057. King Kyansittha of Pagan (r. 1084\u20131113) admired Mon culture and the Mon language was patronized. \nKyansittha left many inscriptions in Mon. During this period, the Myazedi inscription, which contains identical inscriptions of a story in Pali, Pyu, Mon and Burmese on the four sides, was carved. However, after Kyansittha's death, usage of the Mon language declined among the Bamar and the Burmese language began to replace Mon and Pyu as a lingua franca.\nMon inscriptions from Dvaravati's ruins also litter Thailand. However it is not clear if the inhabitants were Mon, a mix of Mon and Malay or Khmer. Later inscriptions and kingdoms like Lavo were subservient to the Khmer Empire.\nAfter the fall of Pagan, Mon again became the lingua franca of the Hanthawaddy kingdom (1287\u20131539) in present-day Lower Myanmar, which remained a predominantly Mon-speaking region until the 1800s, by which point, the Burmese language had expanded its reach from its traditional heartland in Upper Burma into Lower Burma.\nThe region's language shift from Mon to Burmese has been ascribed to a combination of population displacement, intermarriage, and voluntary changes in self-identification among increasingly Mon\u2013Burmese bilingual populations in throughout Lower Burma. The shift was certainly accelerated by the fall of the Mon-speaking Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom in 1757. Following the fall of Pegu (now Bago), many Mon-speaking refugees fled and resettled in what is now modern-day Thailand. By 1830, an estimated 90% of the population in the Lower Burma self-identified as Burmese-speaking Bamars; huge swaths of former Mon-speaking areas, from the Irrawaddy Delta upriver, spanning Bassein (now Pathein) and Rangoon (now Yangon) to Tharrawaddy, Toungoo, Prome (now Pyay) and Henzada (now Hinthada), were now Burmese-speaking. Great Britain's gradual annexation of Burma throughout the 19th century, in addition to concomitant economic and political instability in Upper Burma (e.g., increased tax burdens to the Burmese crown, British rice production incentives, etc.) also accelerated the migration of Burmese speakers from Upper Burma into Lower Burma.\nThe Mon language has influenced subtle grammatical differences between the varieties of Burmese spoken in Lower and Upper Burma. In Lower Burmese varieties, the verb \u1015\u1031\u1038 (\"to give\") is colloquially used as a permissive causative marker, like in other Southeast Asian languages, but unlike in other Tibeto-Burman languages. This usage is hardly employed in Upper Burmese varieties, and is considered a sub-standard construct.\nIn 1972, the New Mon State Party (NMSP) established a Mon national school system, which uses Mon as a medium of instruction, in rebel-controlled areas. The system was expanded throughout Mon State following a ceasefire with the central government in 1995. Mon State now operates a multi-track education system, with schools either using Mon as the primary medium of instruction (called Mon national schools) offering modules on the Mon language in addition to the government curriculum (called \"mixed schools\"). In 2015, Mon language courses were launched state-wide at the elementary level. This system has been recognized as a model for mother-tongue education in the Burmese national education system, because it enables children taught in the Mon language to integrate into the mainstream Burmese education system at higher education levels.\nIn 2013, it was announced that the Mawlamyine-based \"Thanlwin Times\" would begin to carry news in the Mon language, becoming Myanmar's first Mon language publication since 1962.\nGeographic distribution.\nSouthern Myanmar (comprising Mon State, Kayin State, and Tanintharyi Region), from the Sittaung River in the north to Myeik (Mergui) and Kawthaung in the south, remains a traditional stronghold of the Mon language. However, in this region, Burmese is favored in urban areas, such as Mawlamyine, the capital of Mon State. In recent years, usage of Mon has declined in Myanmar, especially among the younger generation.\nWhile Thailand is home to a sizable Mon population due to historical waves of migration, only a small proportion (estimated to range between 60,000 and 80,000) speak Mon, due to Thaification and the assimilation of Mons into mainstream Thai society. Mon speakers in Thailand are largely concentrated in Ko Kret. The remaining contingent of Thai Mon speakers are located in the provinces of Samut Sakhon, Samut Songkhram, Nakhon Pathom, as well the western provinces bordering Myanmar (Kanchanaburi, Phetchaburi, Prachuap Khiri Khan, and Ratchaburi). A small ethnic group in Thailand speak a language closely related to Mon, called Nyah Kur. They are descendants of the Mon-speaking Dvaravati kingdom.\nDialects.\nMon has three primary dialects in Burma, coming from the various regions the Mon inhabit. They are the Central (areas surrounding Mottama and Mawlamyine), Bago, and Ye dialects. All are mutually intelligible. \"Ethnologue\" lists Mon dialects as Martaban-Moulmein (Central Mon, Mon Te), Pegu (Mon Tang, Northern Mon), and Ye (Mon Nya, Southern Mon), with high mutual intelligibility among them.\nThai Mon has some differences from the Burmese dialects of Mon, but they are mutually intelligible. The Thai varieties of Mon are considered \"severely endangered.\"\nPhonology.\nVocalic register.\nUnlike the surrounding Burmese and Thai languages, Mon is not a tonal language. As in many Mon\u2013Khmer languages, Mon uses a vowel-phonation or vowel-register system in which the quality of voice in pronouncing the vowel is phonemic. There are two registers in Mon:\nOne study involving speakers of a Mon dialect in Thailand found that in some syllabic environments, words with a breathy voice vowel are significantly lower in pitch than similar words with a clear vowel counterpart. While difference in pitch in certain environments was found to be significant, there are no minimal pairs that are distinguished solely by pitch. The contrastive mechanism is the vowel phonation.\nIn the examples below, breathy voice is marked with under-diaeresis.\nSyntax.\nVerbs and verb phrases.\nMon verbs do not inflect for person. Tense is shown through particles.\nSome verbs have a morphological causative, which is most frequently a /p\u0259-/ prefix (Pan Hla 1989:29):\nNouns and noun phrases.\nSingular and plural.\nMon nouns do not inflect for number.

It shows pronounced \"schistosity\" (named for the rock). This means that the rock is composed of mineral grains easily seen with a low-power hand lens, oriented in such a way that the rock is easily split into thin flakes or plates. This texture reflects a high content of platy minerals, such as mica, talc, chlorite, or graphite. These are often interleaved with more granular minerals, such as feldspar or quartz.\nSchist typically forms during regional metamorphism accompanying the process of mountain building (orogeny) and usually reflects a medium grade of metamorphism. Schist can form from many different kinds of rocks, including sedimentary rocks such as mudstones and igneous rocks such as tuffs. Schist metamorphosed from mudstone is particularly common and is often very rich in mica (a \"mica schist\"). Where the type of the original rock (the protolith) is discernible, the schist is usually given a name reflecting its protolith, such as \"schistose metasandstone\". Otherwise, the names of the constituent minerals will be included in the rock name, such as \"quartz-felspar-biotite schist\".\nSchist bedrock can pose a challenge for civil engineering because of its pronounced planes of weakness.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"schist\" is derived ultimately from the Greek word \u03c3\u03c7\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd (\"sch\u00edzein\"), meaning \"to split\", which refers to the ease with which schists can be split along the plane in which the platy minerals lie.\nDefinition.\nBefore the mid-19th century, the terms slate, shale and schist were not sharply differentiated by those involved with mining. Geologists define schist as medium-grained metamorphic rock that shows well-developed schistosity. Schistosity is a thin layering of the rock produced by metamorphism (a \"foliation\") that permits the rock to easily be split into flakes or slabs less than thick. The mineral grains in a schist are typically from in size and so are easily seen with a 10\u00d7 hand lens. Typically, over half the mineral grains in a schist show a preferred orientation. Schists make up one of the three divisions of metamorphic rock by texture, with the other two divisions being gneiss, which has poorly developed schistosity and thicker layering, and granofels, which has no discernible schistosity.\nSchists are defined by their texture without reference to their composition, and while most are a result of medium-grade metamorphism, they can vary greatly in mineral makeup. However, schistosity normally develops only when the rock contains abundant platy minerals, such as mica or chlorite. Grains of these minerals are strongly oriented in a preferred direction in schist, often also forming very thin parallel layers. The ease with which the rock splits along the aligned grains accounts for the schistosity. Though not a defining characteristic, schists very often contain \"porphyroblasts\" (individual crystals of unusual size) of distinctive minerals, such as garnet, staurolite, kyanite, sillimanite, or cordierite.\nBecause schists are a very large class of metamorphic rock, geologists will formally describe a rock as a schist only when the original type of the rock prior to metamorphism (the protolith) is unknown and its mineral content is not yet determined. Otherwise, the modifier \"schistose\" will be applied to a more precise type name, such as \"schistose semipelite\" (when the rock is known to contain moderate amounts of mica) or a \"schistose metasandstone\" (if the protolith is known to have been a sandstone). If all that is known is that the protolith was a sedimentary rock, the schist will be described as a paraschist, while if the protolith was an igneous rock, the schist will be described as an orthoschist. Mineral qualifiers are important when naming a schist. For example, a quartz-feldspar-biotite schist is a schist of uncertain protolith that contains biotite mica, feldspar, and quartz in order of apparent decreasing abundance.\n\"Lineated schist\" has a strong linear fabric in a rock which otherwise has well-developed schistosity.\nFormation.\nSchistosity is developed at elevated temperature when the rock is more strongly compressed in one direction than in other directions (\"nonhydrostatic stress\"). Nonhydrostatic stress is characteristic of regional metamorphism where mountain building is taking place (an orogenic belt). The schistosity develops perpendicular to the direction of greatest compression, also called the shortening direction, as platy minerals are rotated or recrystallized into parallel layers. While platy or elongated minerals are most obviously reoriented, even quartz or calcite may take up preferred orientations. At the microscopic level, schistosity is divided into \"internal schistosity\", in which inclusions within porphyroblasts take a preferred orientation, and \"external schistosity\", which is the orientation of grains in the surrounding medium-grained rock.\nThe composition of the rock must permit formation of abundant platy minerals. For example, the clay minerals in mudstone are metamorphosed to mica, producing a mica schist. Early stages of metamorphism convert mudstone to a very fine-grained metamorphic rock called \"slate\", which with further metamorphism becomes fine-grained \"phyllite\". Further recrystallization produces medium-grained mica schist. If the metamorphism proceeds further, the mica schist experiences dehydration reactions that convert platy minerals to granular minerals such as feldspars, decreasing schistosity and turning the rock into a gneiss.\nOther platy minerals found in schists include chlorite, talc, and graphite. Chlorite schist is typically formed by metamorphism of ultramafic igneous rocks, as is talc schist. Talc schist also forms from metamorphosis of talc-bearing carbonate rocks formed by hydrothermal alteration. Graphite schist is uncommon but can form from metamorphosis of sedimentary beds containing abundant organic carbon. This may be of algal origin. Graphite schist is known to have experienced greenschist facies metamorphism, for example in the northern Andes. \nMetamorphosis of felsic volcanic rock, such as tuff, can produce quartz-muscovite schist.\nEngineering considerations.\nIn geotechnical engineering a schistosity plane often forms a discontinuity that may have a large influence on the mechanical behavior (strength, deformation, etc.) of rock masses in, for example, tunnel, foundation, or slope construction. A hazard may exist even in undisturbed terrain. On August 17, 1959, a magnitude 7.2 earthquake destabilized a mountain slope near Hebgen Lake, Montana, composed of schist. This caused a massive landslide that killed 26 people camping in the area.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Radioactive decay of the uranium causes the mineral to contain oxides of lead and trace amounts of helium. It may also contain thorium and rare-earth elements.\nOverview.\nUraninite used to be known as pitchblende (from \"pitch\", because of its black color, and \"blende\", from \"blenden\" meaning \"to deceive\", a term used by German miners to denote minerals whose density suggested metal content, but whose exploitation, at the time they were named, was either unknown or not economically feasible). The mineral has been known since at least the 15th century, from silver mines in the Ore Mountains, on the German/Czech border. The type locality is the historic mining and spa town known as Joachimsthal, the modern-day J\u00e1chymov, on the Czech side of the mountains, where F. E. Br\u00fcckmann described the mineral in 1772. Pitchblende from the Johanngeorgenstadt deposit in Germany was used by M. Klaproth in 1789 to discover the element uranium.\nAll uraninite minerals contain a small amount of radium as a radioactive decay product of uranium. Marie Curie used pitchblende, processing tons of it herself, as the source material for her isolation of pure metallic radium in 1910.\nUraninite also always contains small amounts of the lead isotopes 206Pb and 207Pb, the end products of the decay series of the uranium isotopes 238U and 235U respectively. Small amounts of helium are also present in uraninite as a result of alpha decay. Helium was first found on Earth in cleveite, an impure radioactive variety of uraninite, after having been discovered spectroscopically in the Sun's atmosphere. The extremely rare elements technetium and promethium can be found in uraninite in very small quantities (about 200\u00a0pg/kg and 4\u00a0fg/kg respectively), produced by the spontaneous fission of uranium-238. Francium can also be found in uraninite at 1 francium atom for every 1 \u00d7 1018 uranium atoms in the ore as a result from the decay of actinium.\nOccurrence.\nUraninite is a major ore of uranium. Some of the highest-grade uranium ores in the world were found in the Shinkolobwe mine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (the initial source for the Manhattan Project) and in the Athabasca Basin in northern Saskatchewan, Canada. Another important source of pitchblende is at Great Bear Lake in the Northwest Territories of Canada, where it is found in large quantities associated with silver. It also occurs in Australia, the Czech Republic, Germany, England, Rwanda, Namibia and South Africa. In the United States, it can be found in the states of Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina and Wyoming. The geologist Charles Steen made a fortune on the production of uraninite in his Mi Vida mine in Moab, Utah. Uranium ores from the Ore Mountains (today the border between the Czech Republic and Germany) were an important supply of both the wartime German nuclear program (which failed to produce a bomb) and the Soviet nuclear program. Mining for uranium in the Ore Mountains (under the auspices of SDAG Wismut after the war) ceased after the collapse of the German Democratic Republic.\nUranium ore is generally processed close to the mine into yellowcake, which is an intermediate step in the processing of uranium.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is not a recognized mineral in its own right, but the name is used as a general or field term, to refer to a dark amphibole. Hornblende minerals are common in igneous and metamorphic rocks.\nThe general formula is .\nPhysical properties.\nHornblende has a hardness of 5\u20136, a specific gravity of 3.0 to 3.6, and is typically an opaque green, dark green, brown, or black color. It tends to form slender prismatic to bladed crystals, diamond-shaped in cross section, or is present as irregular grains or fibrous masses.\nIts planes of cleavage intersect at 56\u00b0 and 124\u00b0 angles. Hornblende is most often confused with the pyroxene series and biotite mica, which are also dark minerals found in granite and charnockite. Pyroxenes differ in their cleavage planes, which intersect at 87\u00b0 and 93\u00b0.\nHornblende is an inosilicate (chain silicate) mineral, built around double chains of silica tetrahedra. These chains extend the length of the crystal and are bonded to their neighbors by additional metal ions to form the complete crystal structure.\nCompositional variances.\nHornblende is part of the calcium-amphibole group of amphibole minerals. It is highly variable in composition, and includes at least five solid solution series:\nIn addition, titanium, manganese, or chromium can substitute for some of the cations and oxygen, fluorine, or chlorine for some of the hydroxide (OH). The different chemical types are almost impossible to distinguish even by optical or X-ray methods, and detailed chemical analysis using an electron microprobe is required.\nThere is a solid solution series between hornblende and the closely related amphibole minerals, tremolite\u2013actinolite, at elevated temperature. A miscibility gap exists at lower temperatures, and, as a result, hornblende often contains exsolution lamellae of grunerite.\nOccurrence.\nHornblende is a common constituent of many igneous and metamorphic rocks such as granite, syenite, diorite, gabbro, basalt, andesite, gneiss, and schist. It crystallizes in preference to pyroxene minerals from cooler magma that is richer in silica and water.\nIt is the principal mineral of amphibolites, which form during medium- to high-grade metamorphism of mafic to intermediate igneous rock (igneous rocks with relative low silica content) in the presence of pore water. Much of the pore water comes from the breakdown of micas or other hydrous minerals. However, hornblende itself breaks down at very high temperatures. Hornblende alters easily to chlorite, biotite, or other mafic minerals.\nA rare variety of hornblende contains less than 5% of iron oxide, is gray to white in color, and is named edenite from its locality in Edenville, Orange County, New York.\nOxyhornblende is a variety in which most of the iron has been oxidized to the ferric state, . Charge balance is preserved by the substitution of oxygen ions for hydroxide. Oxyhornblende is also typically enriched in titanium. It is found almost exclusively in volcanic rock and is sometimes called \"basaltic hornblende\".\nEtymology.\nThe word \"hornblende\" is believed to derive from German ('horn') and ('deceive'), in allusion to its similar appearance to metal-bearing ore minerals, or ('to blind') referring to its lustre.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "43534", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43534", "title": "Basalt", "text": "Magnesium- and iron-rich extrusive igneous rock\n \nBasalt (; ) is an aphanitic (fine-grained) extrusive igneous rock formed from the rapid cooling of low-viscosity lava rich in magnesium and iron (mafic lava) exposed at or very near the surface of a rocky planet or moon. More than 90% of all volcanic rock on Earth is basalt. Rapid-cooling, fine-grained basalt has the same chemical composition and mineralogy as slow-cooling, coarse-grained gabbro. The eruption of basalt lava is observed by geologists at about 20 volcanoes per year. Basalt is also an important rock type on other planetary bodies in the Solar System. For example, the bulk of the plains of Venus, which cover ~80% of the surface, are basaltic; the lunar maria are plains of flood-basaltic lava flows; and basalt is a common rock on the surface of Mars.\nMolten basalt lava has a low viscosity due to its relatively low silica content (between 45% and 52%), resulting in rapidly moving lava flows that can spread over great areas before cooling and solidifying. Flood basalts are thick sequences of many such flows that can cover hundreds of thousands of square kilometres and constitute the most voluminous of all volcanic formations.\nBasaltic magmas within Earth are thought to originate from the upper mantle. The chemistry of basalts thus provides clues to processes deep in Earth's interior.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDefinition and characteristics.\nBasalt is composed mostly of oxides of silicon, iron, magnesium, potassium, aluminum, titanium, and calcium. Geologists classify igneous rock by its mineral content whenever possible; the relative volume percentages of quartz (crystalline silica (SiO2)), alkali feldspar, plagioclase, and feldspathoid (QAPF) are particularly important. An aphanitic (fine-grained) igneous rock is classified as basalt when its QAPF fraction is composed of less than 10% feldspathoid and less than 20% quartz, and plagioclase makes up at least 65% of its feldspar content. This places basalt in the basalt/andesite field of the QAPF diagram. Basalt is further distinguished from andesite by its silica content of under 52%.\nIt is often not practical to determine the mineral composition of volcanic rocks, due to their very small grain size, in which case geologists instead classify the rocks chemically, with particular emphasis on the total content of alkali metal oxides and silica (TAS); in that context, basalt is defined as volcanic rock with a content of between 45% and 52% silica and no more than 5% alkali metal oxides. This places basalt in the B field of the TAS diagram. Such a composition is described as mafic.\nBasalt is usually dark grey to black in colour, due to a high content of augite or other dark-coloured pyroxene minerals, but can exhibit a wide range of shading. Some basalts are quite light-coloured due to a high content of plagioclase; these are sometimes described as \"leucobasalts\". It can be difficult to distinguish between lighter-colored basalt and andesite, so field researchers commonly use a rule of thumb for this purpose, classifying it as basalt if it has a color index of 35 or greater.\nThe physical properties of basalt result from its relatively low silica content and typically high iron and magnesium content. The average density of basalt is 2.9 g/cm3, compared, for example, to granite\u2019s typical density of 2.7 g/cm3. The viscosity of basaltic magma is relatively low\u2014around 104 to 105 cP\u2014similar to the viscosity of ketchup, but that is still several orders of magnitude higher than the viscosity of water, which is about 1 cP).\nBasalt is often porphyritic, containing larger crystals (phenocrysts) that formed before the extrusion event that brought the magma to the surface, embedded in a finer-grained matrix. These phenocrysts are usually made of augite, olivine, or a calcium-rich plagioclase, which have the highest melting temperatures of any of the minerals that can typically crystallize from the melt, and which are therefore the first to form solid crystals.\nBasalt often contains vesicles; they are formed when dissolved gases bubble out of the magma as it decompresses during its approach to the surface; the erupted lava then solidifies before the gases can escape. When vesicles make up a substantial fraction of the volume of the rock, the rock is described as scoria.\nThe term \"basalt\" is at times applied to shallow intrusive rocks with a composition typical of basalt, but rocks of this composition with a phaneritic (coarser) groundmass are more properly referred to either as diabase (also called dolerite) or\u2014when they are more coarse-grained (having crystals over 2\u00a0mm across)\u2014as gabbro. Diabase and gabbro are thus the hypabyssal and plutonic equivalents of basalt.\nDuring the Hadean, Archean, and early Proterozoic eons of Earth's history, the chemistry of erupted magmas was significantly different from what it is today, due to immature crustal and asthenosphere differentiation. The resulting ultramafic volcanic rocks, with silica (SiO2) contents below 45% and high magnesium oxide (MgO) content, are usually classified as komatiites.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"basalt\" is ultimately derived from Late Latin , a misspelling of Latin \"very hard stone\", which was imported from Ancient Greek (), from (\"\", \"touchstone\"). The modern petrological term \"basalt\", describing a particular composition of lava-derived rock, became standard because of its use by Georgius Agricola in 1546, in his work \"De Natura Fossilium\". Agricola applied the term \"basalt\" to the volcanic black rock beneath the Bishop of Meissen's Stolpen castle, believing it to be the same as the \"basaniten\" described by Pliny the Elder in AD\u00a077 in .\nTypes.\nOn Earth, most basalt is formed by decompression melting of the mantle. The high pressure in the upper mantle (due to the weight of the overlying rock) raises the melting point of mantle rock, so that almost all of the upper mantle is solid. However, mantle rock is ductile (the solid rock slowly deforms under high stress). When tectonic forces cause hot mantle rock to creep upwards, pressure on the ascending rock decreases, and this can lower its melting point enough for the rock to partially melt, producing basaltic magma.\nDecompression melting can occur in a variety of tectonic settings, including in continental rift zones, at mid-ocean ridges, above geological hotspots, and in back-arc basins. Basalt also forms in subduction zones, where mantle rock rises into a mantle wedge above the descending slab. The slab releases water vapor and other volatiles as it descends, which further lowers the melting point, further increasing the amount of decompression melting. Each tectonic setting produces basalt with its own distinctive characteristics. \nPetrology.\nThe mineralogy of basalt is characterized by a preponderance of calcic plagioclase feldspar and pyroxene. Olivine can also be a significant constituent. Accessory minerals present in relatively minor amounts include iron oxides and iron-titanium oxides, such as magnetite, ulv\u00f6spinel, and ilmenite. Because of the presence of such oxide minerals, basalt can acquire strong magnetic signatures as it cools, and paleomagnetic studies have made extensive use of basalt.\nIn tholeiitic basalt, pyroxene (augite and orthopyroxene or pigeonite) and calcium-rich plagioclase are common phenocryst minerals. Olivine may also be a phenocryst, and when present, may have rims of pigeonite. The groundmass contains interstitial quartz or tridymite or cristobalite. \"Olivine tholeiitic basalt\" has augite and orthopyroxene or pigeonite with abundant olivine, but olivine may have rims of pyroxene and is unlikely to be present in the groundmass.\nAlkali basalts typically have mineral assemblages that lack orthopyroxene but contain olivine. Feldspar phenocrysts typically are labradorite to andesine in composition. Augite is rich in titanium compared to augite in tholeiitic basalt. Minerals such as alkali feldspar, leucite, nepheline, sodalite, phlogopite mica, and apatite may be present in the groundmass.\nBasalt has high liquidus and solidus temperatures\u2014values at the Earth's surface are near or above 1200\u00a0\u00b0C (liquidus) and near or below 1000\u00a0\u00b0C (solidus); these values are higher than those of other common igneous rocks.\nThe majority of tholeiitic basalts are formed at approximately 50\u2013100\u00a0km depth within the mantle. Many alkali basalts may be formed at greater depths, perhaps as deep as 150\u2013200\u00a0km. The origin of high-alumina basalt continues to be controversial, with disagreement over whether it is a primary melt or derived from other basalt types by fractionation.\nGeochemistry.\nRelative to most common igneous rocks, basalt compositions are rich in MgO and CaO and low in SiO2 and the alkali oxides, i.e., Na2O + K2O, consistent with their TAS classification. Basalt contains more silica than picrobasalt and most basanites and tephrites but less than basaltic andesite. Basalt has a lower total content of alkali oxides than trachybasalt and most basanites and tephrites.\nBasalt generally has a composition of 45\u201352 wt% SiO2, 2\u20135 wt% total alkalis, 0.5\u20132.0 wt% TiO2, 5\u201314 wt% FeO and 14 wt% or more Al2O3. Contents of CaO are commonly near 10 wt%, those of MgO commonly in the range 5 to 12 wt%.\nHigh-alumina basalts have aluminium contents of 17\u201319 wt% Al2O3; boninites have magnesium (MgO) contents of up to 15 percent. Rare feldspathoid-rich mafic rocks, akin to alkali basalts, may have Na2O + K2O contents of 12% or more.\nThe abundances of the lanthanide or rare-earth elements (REE) can be a useful diagnostic tool to help explain the history of mineral crystallisation as the melt cooled. In particular, the relative abundance of europium compared to the other REE is often markedly higher or lower, and called the europium anomaly. It arises because Eu2+ can substitute for Ca2+ in plagioclase feldspar, unlike any of the other lanthanides, which tend to only form 3+ cations.\nMid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) and their intrusive equivalents, gabbros, are the characteristic igneous rocks formed at mid-ocean ridges. They are tholeiitic basalts particularly low in total alkalis and in incompatible trace elements, and they have relatively flat REE patterns normalized to mantle or chondrite values. In contrast, alkali basalts have normalized patterns highly enriched in the light REE, and with greater abundances of the REE and of other incompatible elements. Because MORB basalt is considered a key to understanding plate tectonics, its compositions have been much studied. Although MORB compositions are distinctive relative to average compositions of basalts erupted in other environments, they are not uniform. For instance, compositions change with position along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and the compositions also define different ranges in different ocean basins. Mid-ocean ridge basalts have been subdivided into varieties such as normal (NMORB) and those slightly more enriched in incompatible elements (EMORB).\nIsotope ratios of elements such as strontium, neodymium, lead, hafnium, and osmium in basalts have been much studied to learn about the evolution of the Earth's mantle. Isotopic ratios of noble gases, such as 3He/4He, are also of great value: for instance, ratios for basalts range from 6 to 10 for mid-ocean ridge tholeiitic basalt (normalized to atmospheric values), but to 15\u201324 and more for ocean-island basalts thought to be derived from mantle plumes.\nSource rocks for the partial melts that produce basaltic magma probably include both peridotite and pyroxenite.\nMorphology and textures.\nThe shape, structure and texture of a basalt is diagnostic of how and where it erupted\u2014for example, whether into the sea, in an explosive cinder eruption or as creeping p\u0101hoehoe lava flows, the classic image of Hawaiian basalt eruptions.\nSubaerial eruptions.\nBasalt that erupts under open air (that is, subaerially) forms three distinct types of lava or volcanic deposits: scoria; ash or cinder (breccia); and lava flows.\nBasalt in the tops of subaerial lava flows and cinder cones will often be highly vesiculated, imparting a lightweight \"frothy\" texture to the rock. Basaltic cinders are often red, coloured by oxidized iron from weathered iron-rich minerals such as pyroxene.\n\u02bbA\u02bb\u0101 types of blocky cinder and breccia flows of thick, viscous basaltic lava are common in Hawai\u02bbi. P\u0101hoehoe is a highly fluid, hot form of basalt which tends to form thin aprons of molten lava which fill up hollows and sometimes forms lava lakes. Lava tubes are common features of p\u0101hoehoe eruptions.\nBasaltic tuff or pyroclastic rocks are less common than basaltic lava flows. Usually basalt is too hot and fluid to build up sufficient pressure to form explosive lava eruptions but occasionally this will happen by trapping of the lava within the volcanic throat and buildup of volcanic gases. Hawai\u02bbi's Mauna Loa volcano erupted in this way in the 19th century, as did Mount Tarawera, New Zealand in its violent 1886 eruption. Maar volcanoes are typical of small basalt tuffs, formed by explosive eruption of basalt through the crust, forming an apron of mixed basalt and wall rock breccia and a fan of basalt tuff further out from the volcano.\nAmygdaloidal structure is common in relict vesicles and beautifully crystallized species of zeolites, quartz or calcite are frequently found.\nColumnar basalt.\nDuring the cooling of a thick lava flow, contractional joints or fractures form. If a flow cools relatively rapidly, significant contraction forces build up. While a flow can shrink in the vertical dimension without fracturing, it cannot easily accommodate shrinking in the horizontal direction unless cracks form; the extensive fracture network that develops results in the formation of columns. These structures, or basalt prisms, are predominantly hexagonal in cross-section, but polygons with three to twelve or more sides can be observed. The size of the columns depends loosely on the rate of cooling; very rapid cooling may result in very small (&lt;1\u00a0cm diameter) columns, while slow cooling is more likely to produce large columns.\nSubmarine eruptions.\nThe character of submarine basalt eruptions is largely determined by depth of water, since increased pressure restricts the release of volatile gases and results in effusive eruptions. It has been estimated that at depths greater than , explosive activity associated with basaltic magma is suppressed. Above this depth, submarine eruptions are often explosive, tending to produce pyroclastic rock rather than basalt flows. These eruptions, described as Surtseyan, are characterised by large quantities of steam and gas and the creation of large amounts of pumice. \nPillow basalts.\nWhen basalt erupts underwater or flows into the sea, contact with the water quenches the surface and the lava forms a distinctive \"pillow\" shape, through which the hot lava breaks to form another pillow. This \"pillow\" texture is very common in underwater basaltic flows and is diagnostic of an underwater eruption environment when found in ancient rocks. Pillows typically consist of a fine-grained core with a glassy crust and have radial jointing. The size of individual pillows varies from 10\u00a0cm up to several metres.\nWhen \"p\u0101hoehoe\" lava enters the sea it usually forms pillow basalts. However, when \"\u02bba\u02bb\u0101\" enters the ocean it forms a littoral cone, a small cone-shaped accumulation of tuffaceous debris formed when the blocky \"\u02bba\u02bb\u0101\" lava enters the water and explodes from built-up steam.\nThe island of Surtsey in the Atlantic Ocean is a basalt volcano which breached the ocean surface in 1963. The initial phase of Surtsey's eruption was highly explosive, as the magma was quite fluid, causing the rock to be blown apart by the boiling steam to form a tuff and cinder cone. This has subsequently moved to a typical p\u0101hoehoe-type behaviour.\nVolcanic glass may be present, particularly as rinds on rapidly chilled surfaces of lava flows, and is commonly (but not exclusively) associated with underwater eruptions.\nPillow basalt is also produced by some subglacial volcanic eruptions.\nDistribution.\nEarth.\nBasalt is the most common volcanic rock type on Earth, making up over 90% of all volcanic rock on the planet. The crustal portions of oceanic tectonic plates are composed predominantly of basalt, produced from upwelling mantle below the ocean ridges. Basalt is also the principal volcanic rock in many oceanic islands, including the islands of Hawai\u02bbi, the Faroe Islands, and R\u00e9union. The eruption of basalt lava is observed by geologists at about 20 volcanoes per year.\nBasalt is the rock most typical of large igneous provinces. These include continental flood basalts, the most voluminous basalts found on land. Examples of continental flood basalts included the Deccan Traps in India, the Chilcotin Group in British Columbia, Canada, the Paran\u00e1 Traps in Brazil, the Siberian Traps in Russia, the Karoo flood basalt province in South Africa, and the Columbia River Plateau of Washington and Oregon. Basalt is also prevalent across extensive regions of the Eastern Galilee, Golan, and Bashan in Israel and Syria.\nBasalt also is common around volcanic arcs, specially those on thin crust.\nAncient Precambrian basalts are usually only found in fold and thrust belts, and are often heavily metamorphosed. These are known as greenstone belts, because low-grade metamorphism of basalt produces chlorite, actinolite, epidote and other green minerals.\nOther bodies in the Solar System.\nAs well as forming large parts of the Earth's crust, basalt also occurs in other parts of the Solar System. Basalt commonly erupts on Io (the third largest moon of Jupiter), and has also formed on the Moon, Mars, Venus, and the asteroid Vesta.\nThe Moon.\nThe dark areas visible on Earth's moon, the lunar maria, are plains of flood basaltic lava flows. These rocks were sampled both by the crewed American Apollo program and the robotic Russian Luna program, and are represented among the lunar meteorites.\nLunar basalts differ from their Earth counterparts principally in their high iron contents, which typically range from about 17 to 22 wt% FeO. They also possess a wide range of titanium concentrations (present in the mineral ilmenite), ranging from less than 1 wt% TiO2, to about 13 wt.%. Traditionally, lunar basalts have been classified according to their titanium content, with classes being named high-Ti, low-Ti, and very-low-Ti. Nevertheless, global geochemical maps of titanium obtained from the Clementine mission demonstrate that the lunar maria possess a continuum of titanium concentrations, and that the highest concentrations are the least abundant.\nLunar basalts show exotic textures and mineralogy, particularly shock metamorphism, lack of the oxidation typical of terrestrial basalts, and a complete lack of hydration. Most of the Moon's basalts erupted between about 3 and 3.5 billion years ago, but the oldest samples are 4.2 billion years old, and the youngest flows, based on the age dating method of crater counting, are estimated to have erupted only 1.2 billion years ago.\nVenus.\nFrom 1972 to 1985, five Venera and two VEGA landers successfully reached the surface of Venus and carried out geochemical measurements using X-ray fluorescence and gamma-ray analysis. These returned results consistent with the rock at the landing sites being basalts, including both tholeiitic and highly alkaline basalts. The landers are thought to have landed on plains whose radar signature is that of basaltic lava flows. These constitute about 80% of the surface of Venus. Some locations show high reflectivity consistent with unweathered basalt, indicating basaltic volcanism within the last 2.5 million years.\nMars.\nBasalt is also a common rock on the surface of Mars, as determined by data sent back from the planet's surface, and by Martian meteorites.\nVesta.\nAnalysis of Hubble Space Telescope images of Vesta suggests this asteroid has a basaltic crust covered with a brecciated regolith derived from the crust. Evidence from Earth-based telescopes and the Dawn mission suggest that Vesta is the source of the HED meteorites, which have basaltic characteristics. Vesta is the main contributor to the inventory of basaltic asteroids of the main Asteroid Belt.\nIo.\nLava flows represent a major volcanic terrain on Io. Analysis of the \"Voyager\" images led scientists to believe that these flows were composed mostly of various compounds of molten sulfur. However, subsequent Earth-based infrared studies and measurements from the \"Galileo\" spacecraft indicate that these flows are composed of basaltic lava with mafic to ultramafic compositions. This conclusion is based on temperature measurements of Io's \"hotspots\", or thermal-emission locations, which suggest temperatures of at least 1,300\u00a0K and some as high as 1,600\u00a0K. Initial estimates suggesting eruption temperatures approaching 2,000\u00a0K have since proven to be overestimates because the wrong thermal models were used to model the temperatures.\nAlteration of basalt.\nWeathering.\nCompared to granitic rocks exposed at the Earth's surface, basalt outcrops weather relatively rapidly. This reflects their content of minerals that crystallized at higher temperatures and in an environment poorer in water vapor than granite. These minerals are less stable in the colder, wetter environment at the Earth's surface. The finer grain size of basalt and the volcanic glass sometimes found between the grains also hasten weathering. The high iron content of basalt causes weathered surfaces in humid climates to accumulate a thick crust of hematite or other iron oxides and hydroxides, staining the rock a brown to rust-red colour. Because of the low potassium content of most basalts, weathering converts the basalt to calcium-rich clay (montmorillonite) rather than potassium-rich clay (illite). Further weathering, particularly in tropical climates, converts the montmorillonite to kaolinite or gibbsite. This produces the distinctive tropical soil known as laterite. The ultimate weathering product is bauxite, the principal ore of aluminium.\nChemical weathering also releases readily water-soluble cations such as calcium, sodium and magnesium, which give basaltic areas a strong buffer capacity against acidification. Calcium released by basalts binds CO2 from the atmosphere forming CaCO3 acting thus as a CO2 trap.\nMetamorphism.\nIntense heat or great pressure transforms basalt into its metamorphic rock equivalents. Depending on the temperature and pressure of metamorphism, these may include greenschist, amphibolite, or eclogite. Basalts are important rocks within metamorphic regions because they can provide vital information on the conditions of metamorphism that have affected the region.\nMetamorphosed basalts are important hosts for a variety of hydrothermal ores, including deposits of gold, copper and volcanogenic massive sulfides.\nLife on basaltic rocks.\nThe common corrosion features of underwater volcanic basalt suggest that microbial activity may play a significant role in the chemical exchange between basaltic rocks and seawater. The significant amounts of reduced iron, Fe(II), and manganese, Mn(II), present in basaltic rocks provide potential energy sources for bacteria. Some Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria cultured from iron-sulfide surfaces are also able to grow with basaltic rock as a source of Fe(II). Fe- and Mn- oxidizing bacteria have been cultured from weathered submarine basalts of Kama\u02bbehuakanaloa Seamount (formerly Loihi). The impact of bacteria on altering the chemical composition of basaltic glass (and thus, the oceanic crust) and seawater suggest that these interactions may lead to an application of hydrothermal vents to the origin of life.\nUses.\nBasalt is used in construction (e.g. as building blocks or in the groundwork), making cobblestones (from columnar basalt) and in making statues. Heating and extruding basalt yields stone wool, which has potential to be an excellent thermal insulator.\nCarbon sequestration in basalt has been studied as a means of removing carbon dioxide, produced by human industrialization, from the atmosphere. Underwater basalt deposits, scattered in seas around the globe, have the added benefit of the water serving as a barrier to the re-release of CO2 into the atmosphere.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Chemically, beeswax consists mainly of esters of fatty acids and various long-chain alcohols.\nBeeswax has been used since prehistory as the first plastic, as a lubricant and waterproofing agent, in lost wax casting of metals and glass, as a polish for wood and leather, for making candles, as an ingredient in cosmetics and as an artistic medium in encaustic painting.\nBeeswax is edible, having similarly negligible toxicity to plant waxes, and is approved for food use in most countries and in the European Union under the E number E901. However, due to its inability to be broken down by the human digestive system, it has insignificant nutritional value.\nProduction.\nBeeswax is formed by worker bees, which secrete it from eight wax-producing mirror glands on the inner sides of the sternites (the ventral shield or plate of each segment of the body) on abdominal segments 4 to 7. The sizes of these wax glands depend on the age of the worker, and after many daily flights, these glands gradually begin to atrophy.\nThe new wax is initially clear as glass and colorless, becoming opaque after chewing and being introduced with pollen by the hive worker bees, becoming progressively yellower or browner by incorporation of pollen oils and propolis. The wax scales are about across and thick, and about 1100 are needed to make a gram of wax. Worker bees use the beeswax to build honeycomb cells. For the wax-making bees to secrete wax, the ambient temperature in the hive must be .\nThe book \"Beeswax Production, Harvesting, Processing and Products\" suggests of beeswax is sufficient to store of honey. Another study estimated that of wax can store of honey.\nSugars from honey are metabolized into beeswax in wax-gland-associated fat cells. The amount of honey used by bees to produce wax has not been accurately determined, but according to Whitcomb's 1946 experiment, of honey yields of wax.\nProcessing.\nBeeswax as a product for human use may come from cappings cut off the cells in the process of extraction, from old comb that is scrapped, or from unwanted burr comb and brace comb removed from a hive. Its color varies from nearly white to brownish, but most often is a shade of yellow, depending on purity, the region, and the type of flowers gathered by the bees. The wax from the brood comb of the honey bee hive tends to be darker than wax from the honeycomb because impurities accumulate more quickly in the brood comb. Due to the impurities, the wax must be rendered before further use. The leftovers are called slumgum, and is derived from old breeding rubbish (pupa casings, cocoons, shed larva skins, etc.), bee droppings, propolis, and general rubbish.\nThe wax may be clarified further by heating in water. As with petroleum waxes, it may be softened by dilution with mineral oil or vegetable oil to make it more workable at room temperature.\nPhysical characteristics.\nBeeswax is a fragrant solid at room temperature. The colors are light yellow, medium yellow, or dark brown and white. Beeswax is a tough wax formed from a mixture of several chemical compounds.\nBeeswax has a relatively low melting point range of . If beeswax is heated above discoloration occurs. The flash point of beeswax is .\nWhen natural beeswax is cold, it is brittle, and its fracture is dry and granular. At room temperature (conventionally taken as about ), it is tenacious and it softens further at human body temperature ().\nChemical composition.\nAn approximate chemical formula for beeswax is C15H31COOC30H61. Its main constituents are palmitate, palmitoleate, and oleate esters of long-chain (30\u201332 carbons) aliphatic alcohols, with the ratio of triacontanyl-palmitate CH3(CH2)29O-CO-(CH2)14CH3 to cerotic acid CH3(CH2)24COOH, the two principal constituents, being 6:1. Beeswax can be classified generally into European and Oriental types. The saponification value is lower (3\u20135) for European beeswax, and higher (8\u20139) for Oriental types. The analytical characterization can be done by high-temperature gas chromatography.\nAdulteration.\nBeeswax faces challenges in the market due to the presence of various suppliers, making it difficult to distinguish authentic from fake variants. Adulterated beeswax often contains paraffin and toxic additives, posing potential health risks and lacking the genuine honey-scented aroma of pure beeswax.\nPharmaceutical grades of pure beeswax are distributed in the shape of pellets for the cosmetic, phamaceutical and food industries, among other uses.\nProduction.\nIn 2020, world production of beeswax was 62,116 tonnes, led by India with 38% of the total.\nUses.\nCandle-making has long involved the use of beeswax, which burns readily and cleanly, and this material was traditionally prescribed for the making of the Paschal candle or \"Easter candle\". Beeswax candles are purported to be superior to other wax candles, because they burn brighter and longer, do not bend, and burn cleaner. It is further recommended for the making of other candles used in the liturgy of the Roman Catholic Church. Beeswax is also the candle constituent of choice in the Eastern Orthodox Church.\nRefined beeswax plays a prominent role in art materials both as a binder in encaustic paint and as a stabilizer in oil paint to add body.\nBeeswax is an ingredient in surgical bone wax, which is used during surgery to control bleeding from bone surfaces; shoe polish and furniture polish can both use beeswax as a component, dissolved in turpentine or sometimes blended with linseed oil or tung oil; modeling waxes can also use beeswax as a component; pure beeswax can also be used as an organic surfboard wax. Beeswax blended with pine rosin is used for waxing, and can serve as an adhesive to attach reed plates to the structure inside a squeezebox. It can also be used to make Cutler's resin, an adhesive used to glue handles onto cutlery knives. It is used in Eastern Europe in egg decoration; it is used for writing, via resist dyeing, on batik eggs (as in \"pysanky\") and for making beaded eggs.\nBeeswax is used by percussionists to make a surface on tambourines for thumb rolls. It can also be used as a metal injection moulding binder component along with other polymeric binder materials.\nBeeswax was formerly used in the manufacture of phonograph cylinders. It may still be used to seal formal legal or royal decree and academic parchments such as placing an awarding stamp imprimatur of the university upon completion of postgraduate degrees.\nPurified and bleached beeswax is used in the production of food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. The three main types of beeswax products are yellow, white, and beeswax absolute. Yellow beeswax is the crude product obtained from the honeycomb, white beeswax is bleached or filtered yellow beeswax, and beeswax absolute is yellow beeswax treated with alcohol. In food preparation, it is used as a coating for cheese; by sealing out the air, protection is given against spoilage (mold growth). Beeswax may also be used as a food additive E901, in small quantities acting as a glazing agent, which serves to prevent water loss, or used to provide surface protection for some fruits. Soft gelatin capsules and tablet coatings may also use E901. Beeswax is also a common ingredient of natural chewing gum. The wax monoesters in beeswax are poorly hydrolysed in the guts of humans and other mammals, so they have insignificant nutritional value. Some birds, such as honeyguides, can digest beeswax. Beeswax is the main diet of wax moth larvae.\nThe use of beeswax in skin care and cosmetics has been increasing. A German study found beeswax to be superior to similar barrier creams (usually mineral oil-based creams such as petroleum jelly), when used according to its protocol.\nBeeswax is used in lip balm, lip gloss, hand creams, salves, and moisturizers; and in cosmetics such as eye shadow, blush, and eye liner. Beeswax is also an important ingredient in moustache wax and hair pomades, which make hair look sleek and shiny.\nIn oil spill control, beeswax is processed to create Petroleum Remediation Product (PRP). It is used to absorb oil or petroleum-based pollutants from water.\nHistorical uses.\nBeeswax was among the first plastics to be used, alongside other natural polymers such as gutta-percha, horn, tortoiseshell, and shellac. For thousands of years, beeswax has had a wide variety of applications; it has been found in the tombs of Egypt, in wrecked Viking ships, and in Roman ruins. Beeswax never goes bad and can be heated and reused. Historically, it has been used:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 1,585,055. Its county seat is Sacramento, which has been the state capital of California since 1854.\nSacramento County is the central county of the Greater Sacramento metropolitan area. The county covers about in the northern portion of the Central Valley, on into Gold Country. Sacramento County extends from the low delta lands between the Sacramento River and San Joaquin River, including Suisun Bay, north to about beyond the State Capitol and east into the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The southernmost portion of Sacramento County has direct access to San Francisco Bay. Since 2010, statewide droughts in California have further strained Sacramento County's water security.\nHistory.\nSacramento County was one of the original counties of California, which were created in 1850 at the time of statehood. The county was named after the Sacramento River, which forms its western border. The river was named by Spanish cavalry officer Gabriel Moraga for the \"Santisimo Sacramento\" (Most Holy Sacrament), referring to the Catholic Eucharist.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (3.0%) is water. Most of the county is at an elevation close to sea level, with some areas below sea level. The highest point in the county is Carpenter Hill at , in the southeast part of Folsom. Major watercourses in the county include the American River, Sacramento River, Cosumnes River, a tributary of the Mokelumne River, and Dry Creek, a tributary of the Sacramento River.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2010.\nThe 2010 United States census reported that Sacramento County had a population of 1,418,788.

Males had a median income of $39,482 versus $31,569 for females. The per capita income for the county was $21,142. About 10.3% of families and 14.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 20.2% of those under age 18 and 6.6% of those age 65 or over.\nGovernment and policing.\nGovernment.\nThe Government of Sacramento County is defined and authorized under the California Constitution, California law, and the Charter of the County of Sacramento. Much of the Government of California is in practice the responsibility of county governments such as the Government of Sacramento County, while municipalities such as the city of Sacramento and Folsom provide additional, often non-essential services.\nIt is composed of the elected five-member Board of Supervisors, several other elected offices including the Sheriff, District Attorney, and Assessor, and numerous county departments and entities under the supervision of the County Executive Officer. In addition, several entities of the government of California have jurisdiction conterminous with Sacramento County, such as the Sacramento County Superior Court.\nUnder its foundational Charter, the five-member elected Sacramento County Board of Supervisors (BOS) is the county legislature. The board operates in a legislative, executive, and quasi-judicial capacity. The current members are:\nThe Sacramento County Code is the codified law of Sacramento County in the form of local ordinances passed by the Board of Supervisors.\nPolicing.\nThe Sacramento County Sheriff provides court protection and jail management for the entire county. It provides patrol and detective services for the unincorporated areas of the county. Incorporated municipalities within the county that have their own municipal police departments or contract with the Sacramento County sheriff for their policing are: Elk Grove, 170,000, municipal department; Citrus Heights, 88,000, municipal department; Folsom, 78,000, municipal department; Isleton, sheriff contract; Rancho Cordova, 73,000, sheriff contract; Galt, population 26,000, municipal department.\nOther law enforcement agencies in the county include the Sacramento County Park Rangers that service the County Parks, Twin Rivers Unified School District Police servicing police services for Twin Rivers School District, and the Fulton-El Camino Park District Police Department servicing Recreation and Park Districts.\nThe Fulton-El Camino Park District Police operating under the Fulton-El Camino Recreation and Park District was disbanded as of November 26, 2024, following an alleged mismanagement of government funds, ethical and moral dilemmas by Emily Ballus (General Manager) and Beth Johnson (Interim Chief of Police). ABC10 conducted an investigation regarding misappropriation of funds.\nPolitics.\nOverview.\nSacramento County was politically competitive in most presidential elections between 1976 and 2004, but now votes significantly in favor of the Democratic candidates. Candidates from the Democratic Party have carried the county in the past eight presidential elections, and have won a majority of the county's votes five times during that timespan. The city of Sacramento is strongly Democratic, while rural areas are strongly Republican; suburban areas are more divided. This pattern is also present in congressional and state legislative elections. The last Republican presidential candidate to win a majority in the county was George H. W. Bush in 1988. However, it has voted to the right of California at large since 1992.\nIn gubernatorial elections, Sacramento County is typically a bellwether, having voted for the winner every time since 1962 with the exception of 1970 and 2002.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Gubernatorial elections results\nIn the House of Representatives, all of California's 6th congressional district and portions of its 3rd, and 7th districts are in the county.\nIn the State Assembly, all of the 7th and 8th districts and parts of the 6th, 9th, and 11th districts are in the county.\nIn the State Senate, parts of the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 6th, and 8th districts are in the county.\nAccording to the California Secretary of State, as of October 22, 2012, Sacramento County has 698,899 registered voters, out of 944,243 eligible (74%).

{"id": "43551", "revid": "10202399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43551", "title": "Ruby", "text": "Variety of corundum, mineral, gemstone\nRuby is a pinkish-red to blood-red gemstone, a variety of the mineral corundum (aluminium oxide). Ruby is one of the most popular traditional jewelry gems and is very durable. Other varieties of gem-quality corundum are called sapphires; given that the rest of the corundum species are called as such, rubies are sometimes referred to as \"red sapphires\".\nRuby is one of the traditional cardinal gems, alongside amethyst, sapphire, emerald, and diamond. The word \"ruby\" comes from \"ruber\", Latin for red. The color of a ruby is due to the presence of chromium.\nSome gemstones that are popularly or historically called rubies, such as the Black Prince's Ruby in the British Imperial State Crown, are actually spinels. These were once known as \"Balas rubies\".\nThe quality of a ruby is determined by its color, cut, and clarity, which, along with carat weight, affect its value. The brightest and most valuable shade of red, called blood-red or pigeon blood, commands a large premium over other rubies of similar quality. After color comes clarity: similar to diamonds, a clear stone will command a premium, but a ruby without any needle-like rutile inclusions may indicate that the stone has been treated. Ruby is the traditional birthstone for July and is usually pinker than garnet, although some rhodolite garnets have a similar pinkish hue to most rubies. The world's most valuable ruby to be sold at auction is the Estrela de Fura, which sold for US$34.8 million.\nPhysical properties.\nRubies have a hardness of 9.0 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness. Among the natural gems, only moissanite and diamond are harder, with diamond having a Mohs hardness of 10.0 and moissanite falling somewhere in between corundum (ruby) and diamond in hardness. Sapphire, ruby, and pure corundum are \u03b1-alumina, the most stable form of Al2O3, in which 3 electrons leave each aluminium ion to join the regular octahedral group of six nearby O2\u2212 ions; in pure corundum this leaves all of the aluminium ions with a very stable configuration of no unpaired electrons or unfilled energy levels, and the crystal is perfectly colorless, and transparent except for flaws.\nWhen a chromium atom replaces an occasional aluminium atom, it too loses 3 electrons to become a chromium3+ ion to maintain the charge balance of the Al2O3 crystal. However, the Cr3+ ions are larger and have electron orbitals in different directions than aluminium. The octahedral arrangement of the O2\u2212 ions is distorted, and the energy levels of the different orbitals of those Cr3+ ions are slightly altered because of the directions to the O2\u2212 ions. Those energy differences correspond to absorption in the ultraviolet, violet, and yellow-green regions of the spectrum.\nIf one percent of the aluminium ions are replaced by chromium in ruby, the yellow-green absorption results in a red color for the gem. Additionally, absorption at any of the above wavelengths stimulates fluorescent emission of 694-nanometer-wavelength red light, which adds to its red color and perceived luster. The chromium concentration in artificial rubies can be adjusted during the crystal growth process to be ten to twenty times lower than in natural gemstones. Theodore Maiman says that \"because of the low chromium level in these crystals they display a lighter red color than gemstone ruby and are referred to as pink ruby.\"\nAfter absorbing short-wavelength light, there is a short interval of time when the crystal lattice of ruby is in an excited state before fluorescence occurs. If 694-nanometer photons pass through the crystal during that time, they can stimulate more fluorescent photons to be emitted in-phase with them, thus strengthening the intensity of that red light. By arranging mirrors or other means to pass emitted light repeatedly through the crystal, a ruby laser in this way produces a very high intensity of coherent red light.\nAll natural rubies have imperfections in them, including color impurities and inclusions of rutile needles known as \"silk\". Gemologists use these needle inclusions found in natural rubies to distinguish them from synthetics, simulants, or substitutes. Usually, the rough stone is heated before cutting. These days, almost all rubies are treated in some form, with heat treatment being the most common practice. Untreated rubies of high quality command a large premium.\nSome rubies show a three-point or six-point asterism or \"star\". These rubies are cut into cabochons to display the effect properly. Asterisms are best visible with a single-light source and move across the stone as the light moves or the stone is rotated. Such effects occur when light is reflected off the \"silk\" (the structurally oriented rutile needle inclusions) in a certain way. This is one example where inclusions increase the value of a gemstone. Furthermore, rubies can show color changes\u2014though this occurs very rarely\u2014as well as chatoyancy or the \"cat's eye\" effect.\nVersus pink sapphire.\nGenerally, gemstone-quality corundum in all shades of red, including pink, are called rubies. However, in the United States, a minimum color saturation must be met to be called a ruby; otherwise, the stone will be called a pink sapphire. Drawing a distinction between rubies and pink sapphires is relatively new, having arisen sometime in the 20th century. Often, the distinction between ruby and pink sapphire is not clear and can be debated. As a result of the difficulty and subjectiveness of such distinctions, trade organizations such as the International Colored Gemstone Association (ICGA) have adopted the broader definition for ruby which encompasses its lighter shades, including pink.\nOccurrence and mining.\nHistorically, rubies have been mined in Thailand, in the Pailin and Samlout District of Cambodia, as well as in Afghanistan, Australia, Brazil, Colombia, India, Namibia, Japan, and Scotland. After the Second World War, ruby deposits were found in Madagascar, Mozambique, Nepal, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, and Vietnam. It occurs in association with pargasite, zoisite, calcite, phlogopite, painite, sapphire, pyrite and fuchsite. \nThe Republic of North Macedonia is the only country in mainland Europe to have naturally occurring rubies. They can mainly be found around the city of Prilep. Macedonian rubies have a unique raspberry color.\nA few rubies have been found in the U.S. states of Montana, North Carolina, South Carolina and Wyoming.\nSpinel, another red gemstone, is sometimes found along with rubies in the same gem gravel or marble. Red spinels may be mistaken for rubies by those lacking experience with gems. However, the finest red spinels, now heavily sought, can have values approaching all but the finest examples of ruby.\nThe Mogok Valley in Upper Myanmar (Burma) was for centuries the world's main source for rubies. That region has produced some exceptional rubies; however, in recent years few good rubies have been found. In central Myanmar, the area of Mong Hsu began producing rubies during the 1990s and rapidly became the world's main ruby mining area. The most recently found ruby deposit in Myanmar is in Namya (Namyazeik) located in the northern state of Kachin.\nIn Pakistani Kashmir there are vast proven reserves of millions of rubies, worth up to half a billion dollars. However, as of 2017 there was only one mine (at Chitta Katha) due to lack of investment. In Afghanistan, rubies are mined at Jegdalek. In 2017 the Aappaluttoq mine in Greenland began running.\nThe rubies in Greenland are said to be among the oldest in the world at approximately 3 billion years old. The Aappaluttoq mine in Greenland is located 160 kilometers south of Nuuk, the capital of Greenland. The rubies are traceable from mine to market.\nThe Montepuez ruby mine in northeastern Mozambique is situated on one of the most significant ruby deposits in the world, although, rubies were only discovered here for the first time in 2009. In less than a decade, Mozambique has become the world's most productive source for gem-quality ruby.\nFactors affecting value.\nRubies, as with other gemstones, are graded using criteria known as the four Cs, namely color, cut, clarity and carat weight. Rubies are also evaluated on the basis of their geographic origin.\nColor.\nIn the evaluation of colored gemstones, color is the most important factor. Color divides into three components: \"hue\", \"saturation\" and \"tone\". Hue refers to color as we normally use the term. Transparent gemstones occur in the \"pure spectral hues\" of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet. In nature, there are rarely pure hues, so when speaking of the hue of a gemstone, we speak of primary and secondary and sometimes tertiary hues. Ruby is defined to be red. All other hues of the gem species corundum are called sapphire. Ruby may exhibit a range of secondary hues, including orange, purple, violet, and pink.\nClarity.\nBecause rubies host many inclusions, their clarity is evaluated by the inclusions\u2019 size, number, location, and visibility. Rubies with the highest clarity grades are known as \u201ceye-clean,\u201d because their inclusions are the least visible to the naked human eye. Rubies may also have thin, intersecting inclusions called silk. Silk can scatter light, brightening the gem's appearance, and the presence of silk can also show whether a ruby has been previously heat treated, since intense heat will degrade a ruby's silk.\nTreatments and enhancements.\nImproving the quality of gemstones by treating them is common practice. Some treatments are used in almost all cases and are therefore considered acceptable. During the late 1990s, a large supply of low-cost materials caused a sudden surge in supply of heat-treated rubies, leading to a downward pressure on ruby prices.\nImprovements used include color alteration, improving transparency by dissolving rutile inclusions, healing of fractures (cracks) or even completely filling them.\nThe most common treatment is the application of heat. Most rubies at the lower end of the market are heat treated to improve color, remove \"purple tinge\", blue patches, and silk. These heat treatments typically occur around temperatures of 1800\u00a0\u00b0C (3300\u00a0\u00b0F). Some rubies undergo a process of low tube heat, when the stone is heated over charcoal of a temperature of about 1300\u00a0\u00b0C (2400\u00a0\u00b0F) for 20 to 30 minutes. The silk is partially broken, and the color is improved.\nAnother treatment, which has become more frequent in recent years, is lead glass filling. Filling the fractures inside the ruby with lead glass (or a similar material) dramatically improves the transparency of the stone, making previously unsuitable rubies fit for applications in jewelry. The process is done in four steps:\nIf a color needs to be added, the glass powder can be \"enhanced\" with copper or other metal oxides as well as elements such as sodium, calcium, potassium etc.\nThe second heating process can be repeated three to four times, even applying different mixtures. When jewelry containing rubies is heated (for repairs) it should not be coated with boric acid or any other substance, as this can etch the surface; it does not have to be \"protected\" like a diamond.\nThe treatment can be identified by noting bubbles in cavities and fractures using a 10\u00d7 loupe.\nSynthesis and imitation.\nIn 1837, Gaudin made the first synthetic rubies by fusing potash alum at a high temperature with a little chromium as a pigment. In 1847, Ebelmen made white sapphire by fusing alumina in boric acid. In 1877, Edmond Fr\u00e9my and industrial glass-maker Charles Feil made crystal corundum from which small stones could be cut. In 1887, Fremy and Auguste Verneuil manufactured artificial ruby by fusing BaF2 and Al2O3 with a little chromium at red heat.\nIn 1903, Verneuil announced he could produce synthetic rubies on a commercial scale using this flame fusion process, later also known as the Verneuil process. By 1910, Verneuil's laboratory had expanded into a 30 furnace production facility, with annual gemstone production having reached in 1907.\nOther processes in which synthetic rubies can be produced are through Czochralski's pulling process, flux process, and the hydrothermal process. Most synthetic rubies originate from flame fusion, due to the low costs involved. Synthetic rubies may have no imperfections visible to the naked eye but magnification may reveal curved striae and gas bubbles. The fewer the number and the less obvious the imperfections, the more valuable the ruby is; unless there are no imperfections (i.e., a perfect ruby), in which case it will be suspected of being artificial. Dopants are added to some manufactured rubies so they can be identified as synthetic, but most need gemological testing to determine their origin.\nSynthetic rubies have technological uses as well as gemological ones. Rods of synthetic ruby are used to make ruby lasers and masers. The first working laser was made by Theodore H. Maiman in 1960. Maiman used a solid-state light-pumped synthetic ruby to produce red laser light at a wavelength of 694 nanometers (nm). Ruby lasers are still in use.\nRubies are also used in applications where high hardness is required such as at wear-exposed locations in mechanical clockworks, or as scanning probe tips in a coordinate measuring machine.\nImitation rubies are also marketed. Red spinels, red garnets, and colored glass have been falsely claimed to be rubies. Imitations go back to Roman times and already in the 17th century techniques were developed to color foil red\u2014by burning scarlet wool in the bottom part of the furnace\u2014which was then placed under the imitation stone. Trade terms such as balas ruby for red spinel and rubellite for red tourmaline can mislead unsuspecting buyers. Such terms are therefore discouraged from use by many gemological associations such as the Laboratory Manual Harmonisation Committee (LMHC).\nThe concept of electromagnetic radiation amplification through the mechanism of stimulated emission had already been successfully demonstrated in the laboratory by way of the maser, using other materials such as ammonia and, later, ruby, but the ruby laser was the first device to work at optical (694.3\u00a0nm) wavelengths. Maiman's prototype laser is still in working order.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Typically called just ruby or rubi, such annotations are most commonly used as pronunciation guides for characters that are likely to be unfamiliar to the reader.\nExamples.\nHere is an example of Japanese ruby characters (called \"furigana\") for Tokyo (\"\"):\nMost are written with the \"hiragana\" syllabary, but \"katakana\" and \"romaji\" are also occasionally used. Alternatively, sometimes foreign words (usually English) are printed with furigana to provide the meaning, and vice versa. Textbooks sometimes render on-readings with katakana and kun-readings with hiragana.\nHere is an example of ruby characters for Beijing (\"\") in Zhuyin (a.k.a. Bopomofo), Xiao'erjing, and Pinyin.\nIn Taiwan, the main syllabary used for Chinese ruby characters is \"Zhuyin fuhao\" (also known as \"Bopomofo\"); in mainland China \"pinyin\" is mainly used. Typically, unlike the example shown above, zhuyin is used with a vertical traditional writing and zhuyin is written on the right side of the characters. In mainland China, horizontal script is used and ruby characters (pinyin) are written above the Chinese characters.\nXiao'erjing is a Perso-Arabic alphabet, adopted by Hui Muslims and at times utilized as ruby characters in various manuscripts. This system does have its shortcomings, mainly that it has no way of indicating tones. With the spread of pinyin, the usage of this system has been in decline in the past decades. Most manuscripts that do mark the characters with Xiao'erjing, do so from right-to-left, which is quite unique, compared to other systems. This is because usually such manuscripts include Arabic texts such as the Quran, and the Chinese writing is the explanation or translation.\nBooks with phonetic guides (especially pinyin) are popular with children and foreigners learning Chinese.\nHere is an example of the Korean ruby characters for Korea (\"):\nRomaja is normally used in foreign textbooks until Hangul is introduced. Ruby characters can be quite common on signs in certain parts of South Korea.\nHere is an example of the Vietnamese ruby characters () for Hanoi (\"):\nChinese characters and its derivations of it (\"ch\u1eef H\u00e1n\" and \"ch\u1eef N\u00f4m\") which was used by the Vietnamese have fallen out of use in favour of Latin-based script \"ch\u1eef Qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef\" during the French colonial period when it was made a part of compulsory education (1920s onwards). Currently still used by Gin people.\nUses.\nRuby may be used for different reasons:\nAlso, ruby may be used to show the meaning, rather than pronunciation, of a possibly unfamiliar (usually foreign) or slang word. This is generally used with spoken dialogue and applies only to Japanese publications. The most common form of ruby is called \"furigana\" or \"yomigana\" and is found in Japanese instructional books, newspapers, comics and books for children.\nIn Japanese, certain characters, such as the sokuon () (little \"tsu\", ) that indicates a pause before the consonant it precedes, are normally written at about half the size of normal characters. When written as ruby, such characters are usually the same size as other ruby characters. Advancements in technology now allow certain characters to render accurately.\nIn Chinese, the practice of providing phonetic cues via ruby is rare, but does occur systematically in grade-school level text books or dictionaries. The Chinese have no special name for this practice, as it is not as widespread as in Japan. In Taiwan, it is known as \"zhuyin\", from the name of the phonetic system employed for this purpose there. It is virtually always used vertically, because publications are normally in a vertical format, and zhuyin is not as easy to read when presented horizontally. Where zhuyin is not used, other Chinese phonetic systems like pinyin are employed.\nIn academic settings, Vietnamese text written in or may be glossed with ruby for modern readers.\nSometimes interlinear glosses are visually similar to ruby, appearing above or below the main text in smaller type. However, this is a distinct practice used for helping students of a foreign language by giving glosses for the words in a text, as opposed to the pronunciation of lesser-known characters.\nRuby annotation can also be used in handwriting.\nHistory.\nIn British typography, \"ruby\" was originally the name for type with a height of 5.5 points, which printers used for interlinear annotations in printed documents. In Japanese, rather than referring to a font size, the word became the name for typeset \"furigana\". When transliterated back into English, some texts rendered the word as \"rubi\" (a typical romanisation of the Japanese word , instead of (\"rub\u012b\"), the expected transliteration of \"ruby\"). However, the spelling \"ruby\" has become more common since the W3C published a recommendation for \"ruby markup\". In the US, the font size had been called \"agate\", a term in use since 1831 according to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\".\nHTML markup.\nIn 2001, the W3C published the Ruby Annotation specification for supplementing XHTML with ruby markup. Ruby markup is incorporated into the XHTML 1.1 specification and in HTML5.\nFor browsers that do not support Ruby natively, Ruby support is most easily added by using CSS rules that are available on the web.\nRuby markup is structured such that a fallback rendering, consisting of the ruby characters in parentheses immediately after the main text, appears if the browser does not support ruby.\nThe W3C is also working on a specific ruby module for CSS level 2, which additionally allows the grouping of ruby and automatic omission of furigana matching their annotated part.\nMarkup examples.\nBelow are a few examples of ruby markup. The markup is shown first, and the rendered markup is shown next, followed by the unmarked version. Web browsers either render it with the correct size and positioning as shown in the table-based examples above, or use the fallback rendering with the ruby characters in parentheses:\nNote that Chinese ruby text would normally be displayed in vertical columns to the right of each character. This approach is not typically supported in browsers at present.\nThis is a table-based example of vertical columns:\nComplex ruby markup.\nComplex ruby markup makes it possible to associate more than one ruby text with a base text, or parts of ruby text with parts of base text.\nUnicode.\nUnicode and its companion standard, the Universal Character Set, support ruby via these \"interlinear annotation\" characters:\nFew applications implement these characters. Unicode Technical Report #20 clarifies that these characters are not intended to be exposed to users of markup languages and software applications, and are instead for internal use either in systems or the applications themselves. It suggests that ruby markup be used instead, where appropriate.\nThe interlinear annotation characters are part of the \"Specials\" Unicode block:\nANSI.\nISO/IEC 6429 (also known as ECMA-48) which defines the ANSI escape codes also provided a mechanism for ruby text for use by text terminals, although few terminals and terminal emulators implement it. The PARALLEL TEXTS (PTX) escape code accepted six parameter values giving the following escape sequences for marking ruby text:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "43564", "revid": "44328505", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43564", "title": "Action film", "text": "Film genre\nThe action film is a film genre that predominantly features chase sequences, fights, shootouts, explosions, and stunt work. The specifics of what constitutes an action film has been in scholarly debate since the 1980s. While some scholars such as David Bordwell suggested they were films that favor spectacle to storytelling, others such as Geoff King stated they allow the scenes of spectacle to be attuned to storytelling. Action films are often hybrid with other genres, mixing into various forms such as comedies, science fiction films, and horror films.\nWhile the term \"action film\" or \"action adventure film\" has been used as early as the 1910s, the contemporary definition usually refers to a film that came with the arrival of New Hollywood and the rise of anti-heroes appearing in American films of the late 1960s and 1970s drawing from war films, crime films and Westerns. These genres were followed by what is referred to as the \"classical period\" in the 1980s. This was followed by the post-classical era where American action films were influenced by Hong Kong action cinema and the growing using of computer generated imagery in film. Following the September 11 attacks, a return to the early forms of the genre appeared in the wake of \"Kill Bill\" and \"The Expendables\" films.\nScott Higgins wrote in 2008 in \"Cinema Journal\" that action films are both one of the most popular and popularly derided of contemporary cinema genres, stating that \"in mainstream discourse, the genre is regularly lambasted for favoring spectacle over finely tuned narrative.\" Bordwell echoed this in his book, \"The Way Hollywood Tells It\", writing that the reception to the genre as being \"the emblem of what Hollywood does worst.\"\nCharacteristics.\nIn the \"Journal of Film and Video\", Lennart Soberson stated that the action film genre has been a subject of scholarly debate since the 1980s. Soberson wrote that repeated traits of the genre include chase sequences, fights, shootouts, explosions, and stunt work while other scholars asserted there were more underlying traits that define the genre. David Bordwell in \"The Way Hollywood Tells It\" wrote that audiences are \"told that spectacle overrides narrative\" in action cinema while Wheeler Winston Dixon echoed that these films were typified by \"excessive spectacle\" as a \"desperate attempt to mask the lack of content.\" Geoff King argued that the spectacle can also be a vehicle for narrative, opposed to interfering with it. Soberson stated that Harvey O'Brien had \"perhaps the most convincing understanding of the genre\", stating that the action film was \"best understood as a fusion of form and content. It represents the idea and ethic of action through a form in which action, agitation and movement are paramount.\"\nO'Brien wrote further in his book \"Action Movies: The Cinema of Striking Back\" to suggest action films being unique and not just a series of action sequences, stating that that was the difference between \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (1981) and \"Die Hard\" (1988), that while both were mainstream Hollywood blockbusters with a hero asserting masculinity and overcoming obstacles to a personal and social solution, John McClane in \"Die Hard\" repeatedly firing his automatic pistol while swinging from a high rise was not congruent with the image of Indiana Jones in \"Raiders\" swinging his whip to fend off villains in the backstreets of Cairo. British author and academic Yvonne Tasker expanded on this topic, stating that action films have no clear and constant iconography or settings. In her book \"The Hollywood Action and Adventure Film\" (2015), she found that the most broadly consistent themes tend to be a characters quest from freedom from oppression such as a hero overcoming enemies or obstacles and physical conflicts or challenge, usually battling other humans or alien opponents.\nBy late 2010s studies of genre analysis, the term \"genre\" itself is often replaced or supplemented with the words \"mode\" and \"narrative form\" with all three terms often being used interchangeably. Johan H\u00f6glund and Agnieszka Soltysik Monnet said that the difference between these concepts are elusive, but stated that genre could be defined as belonging to specific historical and cultural moments while \"mode\" and \"form\" can refer to a larger pattern that operates across a wider historical and cultural field. In their book \"Action Cinema Since 2000\" (2024), Tasker, Lisa Purse, and Chris Holmlund stated that thinking of action as a mode is more helpful than thinking of it as a genre. The three authors suggested that action frames a certain manner of filmmaking and viewing exceed genre without eclipsing it stating that websites such as IMDb and Wikipedia rarely label films by a single genre and that streaming services such as Amazon Prime and Netflix similarly dilutes what is marketed and received as action.\nHistory.\nIn transnational cinema, there are two major trends in action films: Hollywood action films and their style being imitated around the globe and the other being Chinese-language martial arts films. The roots of action films extend into the beginning of film but it was only in the mid-20th century when action films developed into their own recognizable genre instead of being a collection of other types of films such as Westerns, swashbucklers or adventure films.\nFilms have been described \"action films\" or \"action-adventure film\" as early as the 1910s. Only by the 1980s was the term action as its own unique genre used routinely in terms of promotion and reviewing practices.\nHong Kong action films.\nThe first Chinese-language martial arts films can be traced to Shanghai cinema of the late 1920s. These films were popular during the period, which comprised almost 60% of the total Chinese films. Man-Fung Yip stated that these film were \"rather tame\" by contemporary standards. He wrote that they lacked the kind of dazzling action choreography as expected today and had crude and rudimentary special effects. These films came under increasing attack by both government officials and cultural elites for their allegedly superstitious and anarchistic tendencies, leading them to be banned in 1932. It was not until the base of Chinese commercial filmmaking was relocated from Shanghai to Hong Kong in the late 1940s that martial arts cinema was revived. These films contained much of the characteristics of the previous era. During this period, over 100 films were based on the adventures of real life Cantonese folk hero Wong Fei-hung who first appeared in film in 1949. These films primarily on circuited within Hong Kong and Cantonese-speaking areas with Chinese diaspora. Yip continued that these Hong Kong films were still lagging behind in aesthetic and technical standards that films from the United States, Europe and Japan had during this period.\nYip described Japanese cinema as the most advanced in Asia at the time. This was showcased by the international breakthrough of Akira Kurosawa's films like \"Rashomon\" (1950). The film genre known as the \"chanbara\" was at its height in Japan. The style was a sub-genre to the \"jidai-geki\", or period drama with an emphasis on sword fighting and action. It had a similar level of popularity to that of the Western in the United States. The most internationally known films of this era were the films Kurosawa with \"Seven Samurai\" (1954), \"The Hidden Fortress\" (1958), and \"Yojimbo\" (1961). By at least the 1950s, Japanese films were looked upon as a model to be emulated by Hong Kong film production, and Hong Kong film companies began actively enlisting professionals from Japan, such as cinematographer Tadashi Nishimoto to contribute to color and widescreen cinematography. New literary sources also developed in martial arts films of this period, with the \"xinpai wuxia xiaoshuo\" (or \"new school martial arts fiction\") coming into prominence with the success of Liang Yusheng's \"Longhu Dou Jinghua\" (1954) and Jin Yong's \"Shujian enchou lu\" (1956) which showed influence of the Shanghai martial arts films but also circulated from Hong Kong to Taiwan and Chinese communities overseas. This led to a growing demand in both local and regional markets in the early 1960s and saw a surge in production of Hong Kong martial arts films that went beyond the stories about Wong Fei-hung which were declining in popularity. These new martial arts films featured magical swordplay and higher production values and more sophisticated special effects than the previous films with Shaw Brothers a campaign of \"new school\" (\"xinpai\") martial arts swordplay films such as Xu Zenghong's \"Temple of the Red Lotus\" (1965) and King Hu's \"Come Drink with Me\" (1966).\nIn the 1970s, the Hong Kong martial arts films began to grow under the format of \"yanggang\" (\"staunch masculinity\") mostly through the films of Chang Cheh which were popular. This transition led to the kung fu film sub-genre at beginning of the decade and moved beyond the swordplay films with contemporary settings of late Qing or early Republican periods and had more hand-to-hand combat over supernatural swordplay and special effects. A new studio, Golden Harvest quickly became one of independent filmmakers to grant creative freedom and pay and attracted new directors and actors, including Bruce Lee. The popularity of kung fu films and Bruce Lee led to attract a global audience of these films in the United States and Europe, but was cut short on Lee's death in 1973 leading the phases popularity to decline. Following a period of stagnation, Chang Cheh and Lau Kar-leung revitalized the genre with shaolin kung fu films and Chor Yuen's series of darker swordplay films based on the novels of Gu Long. Kung Fu comedies appeared featuring Jackie Chan as martial arts films flourished into the 1980s. Other films again modernized the form with gangster films of John Woo (\"A Better Tomorrow\" (1986), \"The Killer\" (1989)) and the Wong Fei Hung saga returning in Tsui Hark's \"Once Upon a Time in China\" featuring Jet Li which again revitalized the swordplay styled films. By the turn of the century Hollywood action films would look towards Hong Kong cinema and bringing some of their major actors and directors over to apply their style to their films, such as Chan, Woo, Li, Michelle Yeoh and Yuen Woo-Ping. The release of Ang Lee's \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" (2000) led to a Global release status of Chinese-language martial arts films, most notably Zhang Yimou's \"Hero\" (2002) and \"House of Flying Daggers\" (2004), Stephen Chow's \"Kung Fu Hustle\" (2004) and Chen Kaige's \"The Promise\" (2005). Most Hong Kong action films in the first quarter of the 21st century, such as those in \"Cold War\" (2012), \"Cold War 2\" (2016) and \"The White Storm\" film series have their violence toned down, especially compared to the earlier work of directors like Woo and Johnnie To. Antong Chen, in his study on the Hong Kong action film, wrote that the influence of China and the amount of Chinese co-productions made with Hong Kong created a shift in these films, particularly following the release of \"Infernal Affairs\" (2002).\nHollywood action films.\nHarvey O'Brien wrote in 2012 that the contemporary action film emerged through other genres, primarily Westerns, crime and war films and can be separated into four forms: the formative, the classical, the post-classical and neoclassical phases. Yvonne Tasker reiterated this in her book on action and adventure films, saying that action films became a distinct genre during the New Hollywood period of the 1970s.\nThe formative films would be from the 1960s to the early 1980s where the Anti-hero appears in cinema, featuring characters who act and transcend the law and social conventions. This appears initially in films like \"Bullitt\" (1968) where a tough police officer protects society by upholding the law against systematic corruption. This extended into films which O'Brien described as \"knee-jerk responses\" to perceived threats with rogue cop and vigilante films such as \"Dirty Harry\" (1971) and \"Death Wish\" (1974) where the restoration of order is only possible by force and antisocial characters prepared to act when society does not. The vigilantism reappears in other films that were exploitative of southern society such as \"Billy Jack\" (1971) and \"White Lightning\" (1973) and \"good ol' boy\" comedies like \"Smokey and the Bandit\" (1977). This era also emphasizes the car chase scenes as moments of spectacle in films like \"Bullitt\" and \"The French Connection\" (1971). O'Brien described these films as emphasizing \"the fusion of man and machine\" with the drivers and vehicles acting as one, concluding with what he described as \"the ultimate in apocalyptic modernity and social erasure\" in \"Mad Max 2\" (1981).\nO'Brien described the classical form of action cinema to be the 1980s. The decade continued the trends of formative period with heroes as avengers (\"Lethal Weapon\" (1987)), rogue police officers (\"Die Hard\" (1988)) and mercenary warriors (\"Commando\" (1985)). Following the continuity of the car and man hybrid of the previous decade, the 1980s featured weaponized men who were either also carrying weapons such as \"Sudden Impact\" (1983), trained to be weapons (\"American Ninja\" (1985)) or imbued with technology (\"RoboCop\" (1987)). O'Brien noted that the formative trends at this point had become \"identifiably generic\" as film industries began to reproduced these films during the decade producers like Joel Silver and production companies like The Cannon Group, Inc. began to formulate production of these films with both high and low budgets. The action films of this era have roots in classical story telling, specifically rooted from martial arts films and Westerns, and are built around a three-act structure centered on survival, resistance and revenge with narratives where the physical body of the hero is tested, traumatized and ultimately triumphant.\nThe third shift in action cinema, the postclassical, was defined by the predominance of Eastern cinema and its aesthetics, primarily the wire-work of Hong Kong action cinema from the classical era, through the convention of the increasingly computer generated effects. This saw the decline of overt masculinity in the action film which corresponded with the end of the Cold War in 1991, while the rise of self-referential and parodies of this era grew in films like \"Last Action Hero\" (1993). O'Brien described this era as being soft where the hard bodies of the classical era were replaced with computer generated imagery such as that of \"\" (1991). This was displayed in corresponding with corresponded with millennial angst and apocalypticism showcased in films like \"Independence Day\" (1996) and \"Armageddon\" (1998). Action films of mass destruction began requiring more overtly super heroic characters with further comic book adaptations being made with increased non-realistic settings with films like \"The Matrix\" (1999).\nThe fourth phase arrived following the September 11 attacks in 2001, which suggested an end to fantastical elements that defined the action hero and genre. Following the release of Quentin Tarantino's ' (2003) and ' (2004) revisited the tropes of 1970s action films leading a renaissance of vengeance narratives in films like \"The Brave One\" (2007) and \"Taken\" (2008). O'Brien found that Tarantino's films were post-modern takes on the themes that rescinded irony to restore \"cinephile re-actualization of the genre's conventions.\" The genre went into full circle resurrecting films from the classical period with \"Live Free or Die Hard\" (2007) and \"Rambo\" (2008) finding the characters navigating a contemporary world while also acknowledging their age, culminating into \"The Expendables\" (2010) film.\nThe most commercially successful action films and franchise of the 21st century have been comic book adaptations, which commenced with the \"X-Men\" and is seen in other series such as \"Spider-Man\", and \"Iron Man\" series. Tasker wrote that despite the central characters in superhero cinema being extraordinary, occasionally even God-like, they often followed the traces of the central character becoming powerful of which is fundamental to action films, often dealt with origin stories in superhero films.\nSubgenres.\nHybrid genres.\nAction films often interface with other genres. Tasker wrote that films are often labelled action thrillers, action-fantasy, and action-adventure films with different nuances. Tasker went further to state that the both the action and adventure are often used in hybrid or as interchangeable terms. Along with Holmund and Purse, Tasker wrote that the action films expansiveness complicates easy categorization and though the genre is often spoken of as singular genre, it is rarely discussed as singular style.\nScreenwriter and academic Jule Selbo expanded on this, describing a film as \"crime/action\" or an \"action/crime\" or other hybrids was \"only a semantic exercise\" as both genres are important in the construction phase of the narrative. Mark Bould in \"A Companion to Film Noir\" (2013) said that categorization of multiple generic genre labels was common in film reviews that are rarely concerned with succinct descriptions that evoke elements of the film's form or content and make no claims beyond on how these elements combine.\nFilm studies began to engage generic hybridity in the 1970s. James Monaco wrote in 1979 in \"American Film Now: The People, The Power, The Money, the Movies\" that \"the lines that separate on genre from another have continued to disintegrate.\" Tasker said that most postclassical action films are hybrids, drawing from genres as varied as war films, science-fiction, horror, crime, martial-arts, and comedy films.\nMartial arts film.\nIn Chinese-language films, both \"wuxia\" and kung fu are genre-specific terms, while martial arts is a generic term to refer to several types of films containing martial arts.\nWuxia.\nThe \"wuxia\" film is the oldest genre in Chinese cinema. Stephen Teo wrote in his book on \"Wuxia\" that there is no satisfactory English translation of the term, with it often being identified as \"the swordplay film\" in critical studies. It is derived from the Chinese words \"wu\" denoting militarist or martial qualities and \"xia\" denoting chivalry, gallantry, and qualities of knighthood. The term \"wuxia\" entered into popular culture in the serialization of \"Jianghu qixia zhuan\" (1922) (transl.\u2009Tale of the Legendary Swordsmen). In \"wuxia\", the emphasis is on chivalry and righteousness and allows for phantasmagoric actions over the kung fu film's more ground-based combat.\nKung fu film.\nThe kung fu film emerged in the 1970s from the swordplay films. Its name is derived from the Cantonese term \"gong fu\", which has two meanings: the physical effort required to completing a task and the abilities and skills acquired over time. Films from the period reflected on the cultural and social climate from the period, as seen in invoking Japanese or Western imperialist forces as foils.\nThe kung fu film came out of the \"wuxia\" films. In comparison to the \"wuxia\" film, the focus on the kung fu film is on the martial arts over chivalry, The martial arts film was in decline by the mid-1970s in Hong Kong in relation to the stock market crash, which went from over 150 films in 1972 to just over 80 in 1975, which led to a downfall in martial arts films produced. When the economy began to rebound, a new trend of martial arts films, the Shaolin kung fu films, emerged and sparked a revival of the genre. Unlike the \"wuxia\", the kung fu film primarily focuses on fighting on the ground. While heroes in kung fu films often display chivalry, they generally hail from different fighting schools, namely \"wudang\" and shaolin.\nAmerican-styled productions.\nAmerican martial-arts films feature what author M. Ray Lott described as a more realistic style of violence over the Hong Kong \"wuxia\" films with more realism and are often low-budget productions. Martial arts began routinely appearing in fight scenes in American films in the 1960s with films such as \"The Born Losers\" (1967), which was predominantly a drama, interspersed with martial-arts scenes. American martial arts films predominantly came into production following the release of \"Enter the Dragon\" (1973), with the only higher-budgeted American film to follow in its wake being \"The Yakuza\" (1974). Lott noted the two films would lead to the two subsequent styles of martial arts films in the United States, with films like \"Enter the Dragon\" about people who reveled in combat, often in a tournament setting, and \"The Yakuza\" which had several genres attached to it, but featured several martial arts sequences. By the end of the 1970s, the style was an established genre in American cinema, often featuring tough heroic characters who would fight and not think about their actions until after a fight sequence. In the 1980s, American martial arts films reflected the national move towards conservatism, reflected in films of Chuck Norris and other actors such as Sho Kosugi. The genre would shift from theatrical releases towards the end of the decade with the rise of home video, the lower box-office of American martial arts productions, and a significant portion of direct-to-video action films that first were made in the late 1980s in the United States were martial arts films. Towards the end of the 1990s, production of low-budget martial arts films declined as no new stars in the genre developed and older actors such as Cynthia Rothrock and Steven Seagal started showing up in less and less films. Even internationally popular films like \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" (2000) had negligible effects in American productions in either the direct-to-video field, or in similarly low-budget theatrical releases such as \"Bulletproof Monk\" (2003).\nWhile the American styled-films were predominantly made in the United States, productions were also made in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong and South Africa, and were predominantly shot in the English-language.\nHeroic bloodshed.\nHeroic Bloodshed is genre a that originates with English-language Hong Kong action and crime film fan communities in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Author Bey Logan stated that the term was coined by Rick Baker, in the British fanzine \"Eastern Heroes\". The term is used broadly. Baker described the style as Hong Kong action films which feature gangsters and gunplay and martial arts that were more violent than kung fu films and academic Kristof Van Den Troost described it a term used to distinguish Hong Kong gun-heavy action films from period martial arts films from the late 1980s and early 1990s.\nIn the Chinese language, the term used for these films is \"jinghungpin\", literally meaning \"hero films\". Academic Laikwan Pang asserts that these gangster films appeared at a time when Hong Kong citizens felt particularly powerless with the handover of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to China set for 1997.\nThe key directors of the genre were John Woo and Ringo Lam, and producer Tsui Hark, with the starting point of the genre being traced to Woo's \"A Better Tomorrow\" (1986) make a record-breaking HK$34.7 million at the Hong Kong box office. The style of these films would influence American productions, such as Michael Bay's \"Bad Boys II\" (2003) and the Wachowskis' \"The Matrix\" (1999). Korean media recognized the more fatalistic and pessimistic tone of these films, leading to Korean journalists to label the style as \"Hong Kong \"noir\"\". The influence of these films was evident in early Korean films such as Im Kwon-taek's \"General's Son\" (1990) and later films such Song Hae-sung's \"A Better Tomorrow\" (2010), \"Cold Eyes\" (2013) and \"New World\" (2013).\nPostcolonial Hong Kong cinema has struggled to maintain its international identity as a provider of these types action films because the talents involved had abandoned the Hong Kong film industry after the handover in 1997.\nRegional action cinema.\nAnglophone action film scholarship has tended to emphasize bigger budget American action films, with academics tending to find films that fall out of Hollywood productions as not quite fitting definitions of the genre. By 2024, many national and regional industries were known for action films. These include international films such as Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, South Korean, Japanese, Thai, Brazilian, Chinese, South African, French and Italian action titles.\nAustralia.\nAt the turn of the millennium, Australian genre films have gained increasing acceptance in the Australian feature film industry, while the action genre represented a small percentage of its output in the 21st century.\nScholars of Australian genre film generally used the term \"action-adventure\" which allows them to apply it to various forms of narratives such as tongue in cheek heroic posturing stories like \"Crocodile Dundee\" (1986), road movies or bush/outback films. In the book \"Australian Genre Film\", Amanda Howell suggested that this label was used to help distance Australian cinema from Hollywood films as it would be suggesting commerce over culture and that it would be \"quite unacceptable to make Australian movies using conventions established in the U.S.A.\" Howell stated this to be the case with action films of the 1970s and 1980s with Brian Trenchard-Smith's \"Turkey Shoot\" (1982) being the most notorious. Smith had previously released films like \"Deathcheaters\" (1976) and \"Stunt Rock\" (1979) when financial incentives were available for overtly commercial projects. She commented that action films did tell identifiably Australian stories such as the Sandy Harbutt's biker film \"Stone\" (1974) and Miller's post-apocalyptic film \"Mad Max\" (1979) derived from Australia's social and cultural realities, as well as how George Miller's later \"\" (2015) derived from Australia's long-standing cinematic fascination with the road and cars and a history of cultural anxiety towards a bleak and forbidding outback landscape opposed to the optimism of American action films.\nFrance.\nFrance is a major European country for film production and has made co-production commitments with 44 countries around the world. Around beginning of the 21st century, France began producing a series of films explicitly intended for international markets, with action films representing a significant portion. These films include \"Taxi 2\" (2000), \"Kiss of the Dragon\" (2001), \"District 13\" (2004) and \"Unleashed\" (2005). When asked about the Americanization of these French films, Christophe Gans, director of \"Brotherhood of the Wolf\" (2001) stated that \"Hollywood ownership of certain elements [...] must be challenged, in order to show that these elements have also long been present in European culture.\"\nThe most significant producers of French action films with international ambitions is Luc Besson's France-based EuropaCorp, who released films like \"Taxi\" (1998) and \"From Paris with Love\" (2010). EuropaCorp produced \"Transporter\" franchise starred British actor Jason Statham and made him an action film star, which led him to feature in \"The Expendables\" series by the end of the 2010s.\nIndia.\nThe action film genre has been a staple of Bollywood cinema.\nIn the 1970s, the Bollywood action film consolidated with two films starring Amitabh Bachchan: Prakash Mehra's \"Zanjeer\" (1973) and Yash Chopra's \"Deewaar\" (1975). The box office success of these films made Bachchan a star and spawned the \"angry young man\" film in Bollywood cinema. \nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, the action genre film declined considerably with new films predominantly featuring former bodybuilders failing to reach the popularity Bachchan had. These films predominantly earned their revenue through longer runs at B-grade theatres. A cycle of action films came from these films in the 1980s and 1990s called the Avenging Woman film, where female protagonists seek justice for a rape victim, where the protagonist seeks revenge through violence.\nIn 2009, the action genre was re-popularized with the box office success of \"Wanted\" (2009) starring Salman Khan. Khan reinvented his screen persona with that of his image in the Bollywood press who reported on him in the headlines of Bollywood magazines for his public brawls and affairs with leading actresses. In \"Dabangg\" (2010), Khan continued with this public persona, which was repeated in several of his later films such as \"Ready\" (2011), \"Bodyguard\" (2011), \"Ek Tha Tiger\" (2012) and \"Dabangg 2\" (2012).\nFrom the 1980s, generations of actors in Telugu cinema have invoked Hong Kong action films, such as Srihari who stated he wanted to become an actor after watching his first Bruce Lee film. Several films in Telugu cinema were remakes of Hong Kong films, such as \"Hello Brother\" (1994) which is based on \"Twin Dragons\" (1992). Other films such as the martial arts film \"Bhadrachlam\" (2001), borrows from American cinema with the Jean-Claude Van Damme film \"Kickboxer\" (1989). SS Rajamouli's \"RRR\" (2022) was among the highest budgeted films made in India, and became a rare hit film outside of Indian diaspora, where it broke box office records in Japan and performed exceptionally well in American box office.\nJapan.\nJapan was a difficult market for Hong Kong action cinema to break into. Prompted by the success of \"Enter the Dragon\" and the popularity of Bruce Lee, Toei made their own Bruce Lee-style martial arts films, with \"The Street Fighter\" and its two sequels starring Sonny Chiba as well as a spin-off with a female lead similar to Hong Kong's Angela Mao called \"Sister Street Fighter\". The success of \"Enter the Dragon\" briefly allowed an influx of Hong Kong films to Japan, but the trend did not last, with 28 Hong Kong films, mostly kung fu films, being released in 1974, and the number decreasing to five in 1975, four in 1977 and only two in 1978.\nRyuhei Kitamura, director of \"Versus\" (2000), said in 2004 that he grew frustrated with the Japanese film industry as producers felt they couldn't make action films in competition with Hong Kong or American productions. \"Versus\" grew to become popular outside of Japan, and Kitamura said he was aiming for the foreign audience, as he was disappointed with the current state of Japanese films. Kitamura's characters have been described as \"a careful combination of the maverick independence of 1980s Hollywood action heroes and the calmness and acceptance of Japanese samurai, a consistent criticism of Japanese people today.\" Kitamura followed up \"Versus\" with two manga-inspired big-budget action films, \"Azumi\" and \"Sky High\". Both released in 2003, the former was one of the highest-grossing movies of the year in Japan. Following \"LoveDeath\", Kitamura's next directing work was in the United States.\nKorea.\nThe action cinema of South Korea mostly existed on the margins of the film industry in South Korea. The genre was initially called the \"Hwalkuk\" (\"living theatre\") was a term that indicated plays and films driven by action scenes, while this term has not been used regularly since the late 1970s, with \"action movie\" becoming the more familiar term. The Korean action films came from Japanese cinema, James Bond series, and Hong Kong action cinema. As North Korea borders China, it block access to the continent from a South Korean perspective, the Cold War allowed South Koreans to substitute deferred travel beyond the border through films with locations shot in Hong Kong. While melodrama and comedy were staples in South Korean cinema, most action films were sporadic and tied to the use of locations such as Hong Kong. These films often featured one-legged or otherwise handicapped action characters similar to those of Japanese films (\"Zatoichi\") and Hong Kong films (\"The One-Armed Swordsmen\"). These included Im Kwon-taek's \"Returned Left-Handed Man\" (1968), Aekkunun Bak's \"One-Eyd Park\" (1970) and Lee Doo-yong's \"Returned One-Legged Man\" (1974).\nIn the 1990s, the country's national cinema was in decline leading to Hong Kong gangster films filled in this void leading to large commercial success at the national box office. Early Korean heirs to Hong Kong action films include \"Rules of The Game\" (1994), \"Beat\" (1997), and \"Green Fish\" (1997) involving men who gain confidence and achieve personal growth as they embark on journeys to protect national state and meet devastating ends.\nSouth Korean cinema only received international attention in both art film and blockbuster formats towards the end of the 1990s. Films such as \"Chunhang\" (2000) and \"Memento Mori\" (2000) and action films \"Shiri\" (1999) and \"Nowhere to Hide\" (1999) received commercial releases in North America, Asia, and Europe. The success of the latter two films was unprecedented, and was followed by other South Korean action films in the early 2000s reaching the top of the local box office. These South Korean films mimic some traits of the Hong Kong action cinema, such melodramatic male bonding and marginalized women characters, while the Korean films also have greater elements of tragedy and romance emphasized.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe Britishness of UK-produced action and adventure films vary and are often obscured or gone unnoticed. Others feature predominantly British casts and settings that that suggest Britishness, or are adaptations from well-known examples of British popular fiction featuring characters like James Bond or Sherlock Holmes as seen in Guy Ritchie's two adaptations: \"Sherlock Holmes\" (2009) and \"\" (2011). Tasker described these British action films as different from the Hollywood form also not removed from it in terms of style.\nTasker wrote that, despite their longevity and commercial and cultural prominence, the British \"James Bond\" films rarely serve as exemplars of the action films but more as outliers and strong influences on the genre. While Larry Gross described the series as \"the progenitor of the high-tech action film\" and they exemplified \"The characteristics of the modern Hollywood action thriller\", featuring usually violent action over plot and characterisation, low narrative complexity, and a series of set pieces and chase scenes as well as Bond's one-liners after dispatching a foe. Historian James Chapman said that \"the Britishness of the Bond films has been one of their main selling points, a factor which differentiates them from all the other action movies which have followed in their wake.\"\nReception.\nMost martial arts films made before the mid-1960s were Cantonese-language productions. In comparison, Mandarin-language films were an integral part of Hong\u00a0Kong cinema due to the influx of Shanghai film talent in the postwar period. These films were targeted at the more educated and more refined middle-class audiences who saw themselves as above the contemporary martial arts films.\nScott Higgins wrote in 2008 in \"Cinema Journal\" that Hollywood action films are both one of the most popular and popularly derided of contemporary cinema genres, stating that \"in mainstream discourse, the genre is regularly lambasted for favoring spectacle over finely tuned narrative.\" Bordwell echoed this in his book, \"The Way Hollywood Tells It\", writing that the reception to the genre as being \"the emblem of what Hollywood does worst.\"\nTasker wrote that when action and adventure films secured awards, it is often in categories such as visual effects and sound editing.\nAcclaimed action films.\n\"Time Out\" magazine conducted a poll with fifty experts in the field of action cinema, including actors, critics, filmmakers and stuntmen. Out of the 101 films ranked in the poll, the following films were voted the top ten best action films of all time.\nGender in action cinema.\nHong Kong.\nIn Hong Kong, the \"new school\" of martial arts films that Shaw Brothers brought in 1965 featured what Yip described as \"strong, active female characters as protagonists.\" These female-centered films were challenged with the rise of a new male heroic prototype marked by a strong sense of youthful energy and defiance and by a propensity for violent action, identified with the films of Chang Cheh.\nHollywood.\nViolent female characters have been part of cinema since its early inception, with characters such as Kate Kelly brandishing a shotgun in \"The Story of the Kelly Gang\" (1906). Women traditionally appear in action films as romantic interests, tomboys, or sidekicks to male protagonists.\nViolent white women would appear in other genres as well such as the \"femme fatales\" in \"film noir\" and horror films of the 1970s. Violent women were common in action films since the 1960s. These films featured working-class women exacting revenge. Films of the 1970s featured black women such as Pam Grier in films like \"Foxy Brown\" (1974).\nIn the 1980s, a new symbolically transgressive character emerged in the form of Ellen Ripley in \"Aliens\" (1986) and Sarah Connor in \"\" (1991) and the title character in \"China O'Brien\" (1990) who were physically muscular and or enacted more extreme violence that was usually reserved for male action leads. In her book \"Contemporary Action Cinema\" (2011), Lisa Purse described the media response to female leads in action films reveal a discomfort about their presence and are often described with hesitant terms of women moving into territories that are perceived as masculine. Revealing woman in this form deconstructs the notion that traditional marks of masculinity are not exclusive to men and that musculature was not natural, but something to be achieved. Accusations of these muscular women of the era were levelled at that them by 1993 were that they were \"men in drag\" and that the films generally have to \"explain\" why their female leads displayed physical aggression and why they were \"driven to do it.\" As the 1990s went on, Hollywood films began having more conventional looking women in their action films such as \"The Long Kiss Goodnight\" (1996).\nA vibrant debate exists about whether hypersexualization is itself empowering and, if not, whether a hypersexualized female character can still represent strength and autonomy.\nHypersexualized female action leads had tight fitting or revealing costumes that Tasker identified as \"exaggerated statements of sexuality\" and in the tradition of \"fetishistic figure of fantasy\" derives from comic books and soft pornography. This originated in television with characters like Buffy Summers (\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" (1997\u20132003)) and Xena (' (1995\u20132001)). These series popularity demonstrated a growing market for female action film heroes, in films of the 2000s like ' (2001), \"Charlie's Angels\" (2000), \"Ultraviolet\" (2006), \"Salt\" (2010) and series like \"Underworld\" and \"Resident Evil\". These series like their television series earlier, had their leads eroticized as active and physically capable while also being scantily-clad, hyper-feminized similar to the woman of exploitation films of the 1970s such as \"Caged Heat\" (1974) and \"Big Bad Mama\" (1974). While characters like Frank in \"The Transporter\" series are permitted to visibly sweat, strain and be bloodied, Purse found a reluctance for filmmakers to have their female leads have any appearance warping injuries to ensure a perfectly made-up face. Comedy is often used in films of this period to place the female leads in implausible elements, such as in \"Charlie's Angels\", \"Fantastic Four\" (2005) and \"My Super Ex-Girlfriend\" (2006). The fighting styles of women also tend towards more traditionally feminine fluid movements of martial arts, over using guns or directly punching.\nPurse wrote that the contemporary female action film lead's sexualized brand had her in close proximity of post-feminism discourse about choice, power and sexuality. Marc O'Day interprets the action heroine's dual status of an active subject and sexual object was overturning the traditional gender binary because the films \"assume that women are powerful\" without resorting to justify her physical aggression through narratives involving maternal drive, mental instability or trauma. Purse found that female leads in films like \"Elektra\" (2005), \"\", \"Underworld\", \"Charlie's Angels\" and \"Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith\" (2005) did showcase women having expensive cars, clothing, travel, homes and often high-paying jobs, but that this was only shown as being applicable to white middle-class women. Purse found that these women were empowered at the price of women of other ethnicities. This is seen in \"Aeon Flux\" (2005) where Sithandra dies protecting Aeon and Rain's death to make way for Alice in \"Resident Evil\" (2002).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It features an ensemble cast led by Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, with Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, and Val Kilmer in supporting roles. The film follows the conflict between a Los Angeles Police Department Robbery Homicide detective, played by Pacino, and a career thief, played by De Niro, while also depicting its effect on their professional relationships and personal lives.\nMann wrote the original script for \"Heat\" in 1979, basing it on Chicago police officer Chuck Adamson's pursuit of criminal Neil McCauley, after whom De Niro's character is named. The script was first used for a television pilot developed by Mann, which became the 1989 television film \"L.A. Takedown\" after the pilot did not receive a series order. In 1994, Mann revisited the script to turn it into a feature film, co-producing the project with Art Linson. The film marks De Niro and Pacino's first on-screen appearance together following a period of acclaimed performances from both. Due to their esteemed reputations, promotion centered on their involvement.\n\"Heat\" was released by Warner Bros. on December 15, 1995. It grossed $187.4 million on a $60 million budget and received positive reviews for Mann's direction and the performances of Pacino and De Niro. The film is regarded as one of the most influential films of its genre and has inspired several other works. A sequel has been in development since 2022.\nPlot.\nNeil McCauley, a Los Angeles professional thief, and his crew\u2014Chris Shiherlis, Michael Cheritto, Gilbert Trejo, and Waingro\u2014rob $1.6 million in bearer bonds from an armored car. However, Waingro kills a guard without reason, leading the crew to kill two other guards. McCauley plans to kill Waingro for the guards' deaths, but Waingro escapes. McCauley doesn't know Waingro is a serial rapist and murderer.\nLAPD Robbery Homicide Detective Lieutenant Vincent Hanna and his team (Detectives Bosko, Drucker, Casals, and Schwartz) investigate the robbery. Hanna, a dedicated lawman and former Marine, has a strained relationship with his third wife, Justine, and struggles to connect with his stepdaughter, Lauren. McCauley, who lives a solitary life, begins a relationship with Eady, a graphic designer\u2014the pair bond over their mutual isolation from society.\nMcCauley's fence Nate suggests that he sell the stolen bonds to their original owner, money launderer Roger Van Zant. Van Zant pretends to agree but instead arranges an ambush. Anticipating a trap, McCauley and his crew counter-ambush and kill the hitmen. Afterward, McCauley threatens Van Zant with revenge. An LAPD informant connects Cheritto to the robbery, and Hanna's team begins monitoring him, identifying the rest of the crew and their next target, a precious metals depository. The team stakes out the depository and subsequently breaks in, but when a careless officer makes a noise, McCauley aborts the heist. Hanna refuses to arrest them for breaking and entering since he thinks their charges will be dropped down to misdemeanors.\nMcCauley's crew plans one final bank robbery worth $12.2 million. Hanna stops McCauley on the 105 Freeway and invites him to coffee. They discuss their dedication to their jobs and personal limitations; Hanna talks about his failing marriage, and McCauley admits he's also isolated. Both men admit to mutual respect, but declare they will kill the other if necessary. Waingro makes a deal with Van Zant to eliminate McCauley's crew. Trejo quits, claiming LAPD is too close. McCauley hires old colleague Don Breedan as the getaway driver, and they execute the heist.\nTipped by Van Zant's associate Hugh Benny, the LAPD intercepts the crew after leaving the bank, sparking a shootout. Shiherlis kills Bosko, while Breedan and Cheritto, along with many police, are killed. McCauley and Shiherlis escape, but Shiherlis is wounded by Casals. McCauley takes Shiherlis to a doctor and leaves him with Nate. Suspecting Trejo tipped off the police, McCauley finds him mortally wounded and his wife dead, both at Waingro's hands. Trejo reveals Waingro and Van Zant forced him to disclose the bank plan. McCauley kills him to end his suffering.\nMcCauley kills Van Zant in his mansion, while Hanna's team detains Benny. Learning about McCauley's link to Waingro, who is hiding in a hotel, Hanna uses Waingro as bait to lure McCauley. As McCauley plans to flee, Eady finds his criminal identity but agrees to go with him. Shiherlis, after being forced by the LAPD to bring him in, tries to reconcile with his wife Charlene at her safe house, but she warns him with a gesture, and he escapes.\nHaving separated from Justine, Hanna finds Lauren in his hotel room, unconscious after attempting suicide. He rushes her to the hospital and saves her life. Hanna reconciles with Justine, although the two agree that their marriage will never work.\nMcCauley drives with Eady to the Los Angeles International Airport to flee to New Zealand via private jet. However, when Nate gives him Waingro's location, McCauley abandons his usual caution to seek revenge. Posing as hotel security and triggering a fire alarm evacuation, McCauley infiltrates the hotel and kills Waingro in his room. However, as McCauley returns to Eady, he is spotted by Hanna and flees. Hanna chases McCauley onto the tarmac at the airport, and the two stalk each other before Hanna gets the drop on McCauley and shoots him in the chest. Hanna takes McCauley's hand as he dies of his wounds.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Al Pacino as LAPD Robbery Homicide Lieutenant Vincent Hanna\nAdditional cast members include Martin Ferrero as a hardware salesman, Farrah Forke as news reporter Claudia, Patricia Healy as a woman in a relationship with Bosko, Rainelle Saunders as a prostitute murdered by Waingro, Hazelle Goodman as the prostitute's mother, and Yvonne Zima as the girl taken hostage by Cheritto. Featured as members of the LAPD are Steven Ford as Officer Bruce, Paul Herman as Sergeant Heinz, Cindy Katz as forensics investigator Rachel, Brian Libby as Captain Jackson, and Dan Martin as Detective Harry Dieter. Stuntmen Rick Avery, Bill McIntosh, and Thomas Rosales Jr. portray the armored truck guards. Bud Cort makes an uncredited appearance as restaurant owner Solenko.\nDevelopment.\nMichael Mann, for \"Heat\" (just like for \"Collateral\" and \"Thief\"), created the character of Neil McCauley, played by Robert De Niro, drawing inspiration from the minimalist and detached style of Alain Delon in \"Le Samoura\u00ef.\" The line \"I am alone, not lonely\" from McCauley (De Niro in \"Heat\") directly echoes the one from Jeff Costello (Delon in \"Le Samoura\u00ef\") : \"I never lose, never really\".\nFactual basis.\n\"Heat\" is based on the true story of Neil McCauley, a calculating criminal and ex-Alcatraz inmate who was tracked down by Detective Chuck Adamson in 1964. In 1961, McCauley was transferred from Alcatraz to McNeil Island Corrections Center, as mentioned in the film. He was released in 1962 and immediately began planning new crimes. Michael Parille and William Pinkerton used bolt cutters and drills to rob a manufacturing company of diamond drill bits, which is recreated in the film.\nPacino's character is largely based on Detective Chuck Adamson, who began keeping tabs on McCauley's crew, knowing that he had begun committing crimes again. Adamson and McCauley met for coffee once, as portrayed in the film. Their dialogue in the script is based on the conversation that McCauley and Adamson had. The next time that the two met, guns were drawn, which is also mirrored in the movie.\nOn March 25, 1964, McCauley and members of his regular crew followed an armored car that delivered money to a National Tea grocery store at 4720 S. Cicero Avenue, Chicago. When the drop was made, three of the robbers entered the store. They threatened the clerks and stole money bags worth $13,137 (equivalent to $ in 2024) before getting away after police gunfire.\nMcCauley's crew was unaware that Adamson and eight other detectives had blocked off all potential exits; the getaway car turned down an alley, and the robbers saw the blockade and realized that they were trapped. All four exited the vehicle and began firing. Russell Bredon (or Breaden) and Michael Parille were slain in an alley while Miklos Polesti (on whom Chris Shiherlis is loosely based) shot his way out and escaped. McCauley was shot to death on the lawn of a nearby home. He was 50 years old and the prime suspect in several burglaries. Polesti was caught days later and sent to prison. Polesti was still alive in 2011.\nAdamson went on to a successful career as a television and film producer, and he died in 2008 at age 71. Mann's 2009 film \"Public Enemies\" is dedicated to Adamson's memory.\nThe character of Nate played by Jon Voight is based on criminal-turned-author Edward Bunker, who served as a consultant to Mann on the film.\nCanceled TV series.\nIn 1979, Mann wrote a 180-page draft of \"Heat\". He rewrote it after making \"Thief\" in 1981, hoping to find a director to make it and mentioning it publicly in a promotional interview for his 1983 film \"The Keep\". In the late 1980s, he offered the film to his friend, film director Walter Hill, who turned him down. Following the success of \"Miami Vice\" and \"Crime Story\", Mann was to produce a new crime television show for NBC. He turned the script that would become \"Heat\" into a 90-minute pilot for a television series featuring the Los Angeles Police Department Robbery\u2013Homicide division, featuring Scott Plank in the role of Hanna, and Alex McArthur playing the character of Neil McCauley, renamed to Patrick McLaren.\nThe pilot was shot in nineteen days, atypical for Mann. The script was shortened to almost a third of its original length, omitting many subplots that made it into \"Heat\". The network was unhappy with Plank as the lead actor, and asked Mann to recast Hanna's role. Mann declined and the show was canceled and the pilot aired on August 27, 1989, as a television film entitled \"L.A. Takedown\", which was eventually released on VHS and DVD in Europe.\nProduction.\nPre-production.\nOn April 5, 1994, Mann was reported to have abandoned his earlier plan to shoot a biopic of James Dean in favor of directing \"Heat\", producing it with Art Linson. The film marks the first on-screen appearance together of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. Both actors had starred in \"The Godfather Part II\" but, owing to the film's story structure, they are not seen in the same scene. Pacino and De Niro were Mann's first choices for the roles of Hanna and McCauley, respectively, and they both immediately agreed to act.\nMann assigned Janice Polley, a former collaborator on \"The Last of the Mohicans\", as the film's location manager, along with Lori Balton, who primarily handled scouting duties. Scouting locations lasted from August to December 1994. Mann requested locations that had not appeared on film before, in which Balton was successful\u2014fewer than 10 of the 85 filming locations were previously used. The most challenging shooting location proved to be Los Angeles International Airport, with the film crew nearly missing the shot due to a threat to the airport by the Unabomber.\nTo make the long shootout more realistic, they hired British ex-Special Air Service sergeant Andy McNab as a technical weapons trainer and adviser. He designed a weapons-training curriculum to train the actors for three months using live ammunition before shooting with blanks for the actual take and worked with training them for the bank robbery. The training worked so well, the U.S Army used parts of the film to train new soldiers.\nCasting.\nDe Niro was the first cast member to receive the film script, showing it to Pacino, who also wanted to be part of the film. De Niro believed that \"Heat\" was a \"very good story, had a particular feel to it, a reality and authenticity\". In 2016, Pacino revealed that he viewed his character as having been under the influence of cocaine throughout the film.\nMann took Kilmer, Sizemore and De Niro to Folsom State Prison to interview actual career criminals to prepare for their roles. While researching her role, Judd met several former prostitutes who became housewives.\nKeanu Reeves was offered the role of Chris Shiherlis, but he turned it down in favor of playing Hamlet at the Manitoba Theatre Centre. As a result, Val Kilmer was given the role. Jon Bon Jovi also auditioned.\nFilming.\nPrincipal photography for \"Heat\" lasted 107 days during the summer of 1995. All of the shooting was done on location in and around Los Angeles due to Mann's decision not to use a soundstage. Among the key filming locations were the Citigroup Center, where the bank heist and police shootout takes place, and the Kate Mantilini restaurant, which serves as the location of the meeting over coffee between Pacino and De Niro's characters.\nThe film's cinematographer Dante Spinotti used a combination of natural and practical lighting to capture grittiness and realism for the film. The film's visual style also captures the vastness of Los Angeles and the isolation of its characters within the urban sprawl. Mann and Spinotti often use wide shots and long takes to create a sense of scale and immersion.\nBoth Al Pacino and Robert De Niro prepared extensively for their roles. They spent time with real detectives and criminals to understand their characters in depth. The diner scene with Pacino and De Niro was shot with minimal rehearsals to maintain the spontaneity and intensity of their interaction. Mann used multiple cameras to capture the scene from different angles, focusing on close-ups to highlight the tension and subtleties of each actor's performance.\nSoundtrack.\nOn December 19, 1995, Warner Bros. Records released a soundtrack album on cassette and CD to accompany the film, titled \"Heat: Music from the Motion Picture\". The album is produced by Matthias Gohl. It contains a 29-minute selection of the film score composed by Elliot Goldenthal, as well as songs by other artists, such as U2 and Brian Eno (collaborating as Passengers), Terje Rypdal, Moby and Lisa Gerrard.\n\"Heat\" uses an abridged instrumental rendition of the Joy Division song \"New Dawn Fades\" by Moby, which is also featured in the same form on the soundtrack album. Mann reused the Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten track \"Armenia\" in his 1999 film \"The Insider\". The film ends with Moby's \"God Moving Over the Face of the Waters\", a different version of which is included at the end of the soundtrack album.\nMann and Goldenthal decided on an atmospheric situation for the film soundtrack. Goldenthal uses a setup consisting of multiple guitars, which he termed \"guitar orchestra\", and thought that it brought the film score closer to a European style.\nRelease.\nBox office.\n\"Heat\" was released on December 15, 1995, and opened at the box office with $8.4 million from 1,325 theaters, finishing in third place behind \"Jumanji\" and \"Toy Story\". It went on to earn a total gross of $67.4 million in United States, and $120 million in foreign box offices. \"Heat\" was ranked the No. 25 highest-grossing film of 1995.\nHome media.\n\"Heat\" was released on VHS on November 12, 1996, by Warner Home Video. Due to its long runtime, the film had to be released on two separate cassettes. A DVD release followed on July 27, 1999. A two-disc special-edition DVD was released by Warner Home Video on February 22, 2005, featuring an audio commentary by Michael Mann, deleted scenes and numerous documentaries detailing the film's production. This edition contains the original theatrical cut.\nThe initial Blu-ray release was by Warner Home Video on November 10, 2009, featuring a high-definition film transfer, supervised by Mann. Among the disc extras are Mann's audio commentary, a one-hour documentary about the making of the film, and ten minutes of scenes deleted from the film. As well as approving the look of the transfer, Mann also recut two scenes slightly differently, referring to them as \"new content changes\".\nA \"Director's Definitive Edition\" blu-ray was released on May 9, 2017, by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, who acquired the distribution rights to the film through their part-ownership of Regency back in 2015. Sourced from a 4K remaster of the film supervised by Mann, the two-disc set contains all the extras from the 2009 Blu-ray, with two filmmakers panels from 2015 and 2016, one of which was moderated by Christopher Nolan.\nA 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray Ultimate Collector's Edition of \"Heat\" that contains the Director's Definitive Edition of the film on UHD Blu-ray and Blu-ray, along with legacy bonus materials released on August 9, 2022, by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment (under the 20th Century Studios label), was released coinciding with the release date of Mann's sequel novel. Unlike the previous home media releases, the Director's Definitive Edition Blu-ray and the 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray Ultimate Collector's Edition did not feature the Warner Bros. Pictures logo at the beginning, although the in-credit closing is retained.\n\"Heat\" was broadcast on NBC television on January 3, 1999, in a significantly edited version. Mann had offered the network some scenes that had been filmed but omitted from the theatrical edit with hope of having the film shown in four hours (with commercials) over two nights. Instead, NBC chose to cut nearly 40 minutes from the theatrical version so that \"Heat\" could be shown in a three-hour time slot (with commercials). Mann told \"Variety\", \"They cut so much out of the movie that they destroyed the narrative of the film along with its integrity... Too much time was taken out of the film that wasn't due to language or other content.\" As a result, Mann had his director's credit on the TV version replaced with the pseudonym \"Alan Smithee\".\nReception.\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, \"Heat\" holds an approval rating of 84%, based on 152 reviews and an average IMDb rating of 8.3/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Though Al Pacino and Robert De Niro share but a handful of screen minutes together, \"Heat\" is an engrossing crime drama that draws compelling performances from its stars \u2013 and confirms Michael Mann's mastery of the genre.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 76 out of 100, based on 22 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2212\" on a scale of A+ to F.\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four. He described Mann's script as \"uncommonly literate\", with a psychological insight into the symbiotic relationship between police and criminals, and the fractured intimacy between the male and female characters: \"It's not just an action picture. Above all, the dialogue is complex enough to allow the characters to say what they're thinking: They are eloquent, insightful, fanciful, poetic when necessary. They're not trapped with cliches. Of the many imprisonments possible in our world, one of the worst must be to be inarticulate \u2013 to be unable to tell another person what you really feel.\" Simon Cote of \"The Austin Chronicle\" called the film \"one of the most intelligent crime-thrillers to come along in years\", and said Pacino and De Niro's scenes together were \"poignant and gripping.\"\nKenneth Turan of the \"Los Angeles Times\" called the film a \"sleek, accomplished piece of work, meticulously controlled and completely involving. The dark end of the street doesn't get much more inviting than this.\" Todd McCarthy of \"Variety\" wrote, \"Stunningly made and incisively acted by a large and terrific cast, Michael Mann's ambitious study of the relativity of good and evil stands apart from other films of its type by virtue of its extraordinarily rich characterizations and its thoughtful, deeply melancholy take on modern life.\" Owen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave it a B\u2212 rating, saying that \"Mann's action scenes ... have an existential, you-are-there jitteriness,\" but called the heist-planning and Hanna's investigation scenes \"dry, talky.\"\n\"Rolling Stone\" ranked \"Heat\" #28 on its list of \"The 100 Greatest Movies of the '90s\", and \"The Guardian\" ranked it #22 on its list of \"The Greatest Crime Films of All Time\", while other publications have noted its influence on numerous subsequent films.\nAlthough it did not receive any major award nominations, the film was nominated for Best Action/Adventure Film and Kilmer for Best Supporting Actor at the Saturn Awards but lost to \"The Usual Suspects\" and \"12 Monkeys\" respectively.\nImpact.\nFrench gangster R\u00e9doine Fa\u00efd told Mann at a film festival \"You were my technical adviser\". The media described later robberies as resembling scenes from \"Heat\", including armored car robberies in South Africa, Colombia, Denmark, and Norway and the 1997 North Hollywood shootout, in which Larry Phillips Jr. and Emil M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu robbed the North Hollywood branch of the Bank of America and, similarly to the film, were confronted by the LAPD as they left the bank. A copy of \"Heat\" was found in the VCR at Phillips' residence. This shootout is one of the longest and bloodiest events of its type in American police history. Both robbers were killed, and eleven police officers and seven civilians were injured during the shootout. \"Heat\" was often referred to during the coverage of the shootout.\nFor his 2008 film \"The Dark Knight\", director Christopher Nolan drew inspiration in his portrayal of Gotham City from \"Heat\" in order \"to tell a very large, city story or the story of a city\". In 2016, a year after the 20th anniversary of \"Heat\", Nolan moderated a Q&amp;A session with Michael Mann and cast and crew at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater.\n\"Heat\" was one of the inspirations behind the highly influential 2001 video game \"Grand Theft Auto III\" as well as the 2008 sequel \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", notably the mission \"Three Leaf Clover\", which was inspired by the climactic bank robbery and police shootout, and the 2013 sequel \"Grand Theft Auto V\", notably the mission \"Blitz Play\", in which the crew blocks and then knocks over an armored car in order to rob it.\nDirector Mia Hansen-L\u00f8ve has said she is \"obsessed\" with \"Heat\" and said \"the themes of \"Heat\", actually, are themes of my films, except in a very different way, in a very different world\".\nSubsequent works.\nOn March 16, 2016, Mann announced that he was developing a \"Heat\" prequel novel, as a part of launching his company Michael Mann Books. On April 27, 2017, Reed Farrel Coleman joined the project as co-author. On May 15, 2020, Mann stated that the novel would function as both a prequel and a sequel, with plot taking place before and after the film's main events. By January 19, 2022, it was revealed that the novel would be a collaboration between Mann and Meg Gardiner; it was subsequently released in August 2022. The title is \"Heat 2.\"\nIn September 2019, Michael Mann stated that he intends to produce an adaptation of the novel, acknowledging film and television as possible mediums for release. By July 5, 2022, Mann reaffirmed his plans to adapt the novel follow-up into a feature film, while stating that the principal cast from the first installment may be recast for the adaptation. In April 2023, it was reported that the sequel was in development, with Adam Driver in talks to play young McCauley.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It stretches from central and eastern Afghanistan into northwestern Pakistan and far southeastern Tajikistan. The range forms the western section of the \"Hindu Kush Himalayan Region\" (\"HKH\"); to the north, near its northeastern end, the Hindu Kush buttresses the Pamir Mountains to the north near the point where the borders of China, Pakistan and Afghanistan meet, after which it runs southwest through Pakistan and into Afghanistan near their border. \nThe eastern end of the Hindu Kush merges with the Karakoram Range. Towards its southern end, it connects with the White Mountains near the Kabul River. It divides the valley of the Amu Darya (the ancient \"Oxus\") to the north from the Indus River valley to the south. The range has numerous high snow-capped peaks, with the highest point being Tirich Mir or Terichmir at in the Chitral District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.\nThe Hindu Kush range region was a historically significant center of Buddhism, with sites such as the Bamiyan Buddhas. The range and communities settled in it hosted ancient monasteries, important trade networks and travelers between Central Asia and South Asia. While the vast majority of the region has been majority-Muslim for several centuries now, certain portions of the Hindu Kush only became Islamized relatively recently, such as Kafiristan, which retained ancient polytheistic beliefs until the 19th century when it was converted to Islam by the Emirate of Afghanistan and renamed Nuristan (\"land of light\"). The Hindu Kush range has also been the passageway for invasions of the Indian subcontinent, and continues to be important to contemporary warfare in Afghanistan.\nEtymology.\nFrom a historical perspective, the name \"Hindu Kush\" (also written as \"Hindukush\") is relatively recent. It does not appear in the writings of the early Arab geographers and is first mentioned in the works of Ibn Battuta, in the 14th century.\n\"Hindu Kush\" is generally translated as \"Killer of Hindus\" or \"Hindu-Killer\" in the popular literature. The earliest explanation offered for the name comes from Ibn Battuta. According to him, \"Hindu Kush\" means Hindu-slayer as slaves from the Indian subcontinent died in the harsh climatic conditions of the mountains while being taken to Turkestan by traders. \nSeveral other scholars believe the name to be a corruption of \"Hindu Koh\" ('mountains of India'). The 16th-century Mughal court historian Abu al-Fazl ibn Mubarak also refers to the range as Hindu Koh in his \"Ain-i-Akbari\". According to Nigel Allan, the term \"Hindu Kush\" had two alternate meanings popular for centuries i.e 'mountains of India' and 'sparkling snows of India', with \"Kush\" respectively being a soft variant of \"kuh\" ('mountain') or referring to the quality of snow. Allan further states that to the Arab geographers Hindu Kush was the frontier boundary of Hindustan. \nAnother theory posits the name to may have been derived from ancient Avestan, meaning 'water mountain', with Kush probably being a corruption of the Persian word kuh ('mountain'). According to \"Hobson-Jobson\", a 19th-century British dictionary, \"Hindukush\" might be a corruption of the ancient Latin \"Indicus\" [\"Caucasus\"] ('Caucasus of India')\";\" the entry mentions the interpretation first given by Ibn Battuta as a popular theory already at that time, despite doubts cast upon it.\nSome 19th-century encyclopedias and gazetteers state the term \"Hindu Kush\" to originally have applied only to the peak in the area of the Kushan Pass, which had become a center of the Kushan Empire by the first century.\nOther names.\nIn Vedic Sanskrit, the range was known as \"upari\u015baina\", and in Avestan, as \"up\u0101irisa\u0113na\" (from Proto-Iranian *\"up\u0101risaina\"- 'covered with juniper'). It can alternatively be interpreted as \"beyond the reach of eagles\".\nIn the time of Alexander the Great, the mountain range was referred to as the \"Caucasus Indicus\" (as opposed to the Greater Caucasus range between the Caspian and Black Seas), and the extension of the former as \"Paropamisos\" (see \"Paropamisadae\") by Hellenic Greeks in the late first millennium BCE.\nThe range was also known as \"Hindu Koh\" during the medieval period, as referred to as in the works of Abu al-Fazl during the reign of Mughal emperor Akbar.\nGeography.\nThe range forms the western section of the \"Hindu Kush Himalayan Region\" (\"HKH\") and is the westernmost extension of the Pamir Mountains, the Karakoram and the Himalayas. It divides the valley of the Amu Darya (the ancient \"Oxus\") to the north from the Indus River valley to the south. The range has numerous high snow-capped peaks, with the highest point being Tirich Mir or Terichmir at in the Chitral District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. To the north, near its northeastern end, the Hindu Kush buttresses the Pamir Mountains near the point where the borders of China, Pakistan and Afghanistan meet, after which it runs southwest through Pakistan and into Afghanistan near their border. The eastern end of the Hindu Kush in the north merges with the Karakoram Range. Towards its southern end, it connects with the Spin Ghar Range near the Kabul River.\nPeaks.\nMany peaks of the range are between ; however, some are much higher, with an average peak height of . The mountains of the Hindu Kush range diminish in height as they stretch westward. Near Kabul, in the west, they attain heights of ; in the east they extend from .\nPasses.\nNumerous high passes (\"kotal\") transect the mountains, forming a strategically important network for the transit of caravans. The most important mountain pass in Afghanistan is the Salang Pass (Kotal-e Salang) () north of Kabul, which links southern Afghanistan to northern Afghanistan. The Salang Tunnel at and the extensive network of galleries on the approach roads was constructed with Soviet financial and technological assistance and involved drilling through the heart of the Hindu Kush; since the start of the wars in Afghanistan it has been an active area of armed conflict with various parties trying to control the strategic tunnel. The range has several other passes in Afghanistan, the lowest of which is the southern Shibar pass () where the Hindu Kush range terminates.\nBefore the Salang Tunnel, another feat of engineering was the road constructed through the Tang-e Gharu gorge near Kabul, replacing the ancient Lataband Pass and greatly reducing travel time towards the Pakistani border at the Khyber Pass.\nOther mountain passes are at altitudes of about or higher, including the Broghil Pass at 12,460 feet in Pakistan, and the Dorah Pass between Pakistan and Afghanistan at 14,000 feet. Other high passes in Pakistan include the Lowari Pass at 10,200 feet, the Gomal Pass. The Darmodar Aghost Pass is at elevation of . The Ishkoman Aghost Pass is at elevation of .\nWatershed.\nThe Hindu Kush form the boundary between the Indus watershed in South Asia, and Amu Darya watershed in Central Asia. Melt water from snow and ice feeds major river systems in Central Asia: the Amu Darya (which feeds the Aral Sea), Helmand River (which is a major source of water for the Sistan Basin in southern Afghanistan and Iran), and the Kabul River\u00a0\u2013 the last of which is a major tributary of the Indus River. Smaller rivers with headwaters in the range include the Khash, the Farah and the Arashkan (Harut) rivers. The basins of these rivers serve the ecology and economy of the region, but the water flow in these rivers greatly fluctuates, and reliance on these has been a historical problem with extended droughts being commonplace. The eastern end of the range, with the highest peaks, high snow accumulation allows to long-term water storage.\nGeology.\nGeologically, the range is rooted in the formation of the subcontinent from a region of Gondwana that drifted away from East Africa about 160 million years ago, around the Middle Jurassic period. The Indian subcontinent, Australia and islands of the Indian Ocean rifted further, drifting northeastwards, with the Indian subcontinent colliding with the Eurasian Plate nearly 55 million years ago, towards the end of Palaeocene. This collision gradually formed the Himalayas, including the Hindu Kush.\nThe Hindu Kush are a part of the \"young Eurasian mountain range consisting of metamorphic rocks such as schist, gneiss and marble, as well as of intrusives such as granite, diorite of different age and size\". The northern regions of the Hindu Kush witness Himalayan winter and have glaciers, while its southeastern end witnesses the fringe of Indian subcontinent summer monsoons.\nThe Hindu Kush range remains geologically active and is still rising; it is prone to earthquakes. The Hindu Kush system stretches about laterally, and its median north\u2013south measurement is about . The mountains are orographically described in several parts. Peaks in the western Hindu Kush rise to over and stretch between Darra-ye Sekari and the Shibar Pass in the west and the Khawak Pass in the east. The central Hindu Kush peaks rise to over , and this section has numerous spurs between the Khawak Pass in the east and the Dur\u0101h Pass in the west. In 2005 and 2015 there were some major earthquakes.\nThe eastern Hindu Kush, also known as the \"High Hindu Kush\", is mostly located in northern Pakistan and the Nuristan and Badakhshan provinces of Afghanistan with peaks over . This section extends from the Dur\u0101h Pass to the Baroghil Pass at the border between northeastern Afghanistan and north Pakistan. The Chitral District of Pakistan is home to Tirich Mir, Noshaq, and Istoro Nal\u00a0\u2013 the highest peaks in the Hindu Kush. The ridges between Khawak Pass and Badakshan is over and are called the Kaja Mohammed range.\nLand cover and land use.\nICIMOD's first annual regional 30-meter resolution land cover database of HKH generated using public domain Landsat images demonstrated that grassland was the most dominant land cover, followed by barren land, which includes areas with bare areas. In 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015, grassland covered 37.2%, 37.6%, 38.7%, and 38.2%, respectively, of the total area of the HKH region. During the same years, the second dominant land cover was barren areas, including bare soil and bare rock. In 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015, bare soil and bare rock covered 32.1, 31.4, 30.4, and 30.7%. The cropland cover in 2000 was about 5.1% and about 5.4% in 2015. Snow and glacier areas covered about 4% of the high-elevation section in 2018, while waterbodies and riverbeds/channels together accounted for 2%. The weather conditions also have an impact on the land cover patterns across the regions. In the HKH, forest cover is mostly distributed in the south and south-eastern areas, where precipitation is more; the grasslands are mostly distributed in the north and north-western parts, while cropland is mostly found in the southern part of the region.\nFlora and fauna.\nThe mountainous areas of Hindu Kush range are mostly barren or, at the most, sparsely sprinkled with trees and stunted bushes. From about , states Yarshater, \"sclerophyllous forests are predominant with Quercus and Olea (wild olive); above that, up to a height of about one finds coniferous forests with Cedrus, Picea, Abies, Pinus, and junipers\". The inner valleys of the Hindu Kush see little rain and have desert vegetation. On the other hand, Eastern Himalaya is home to multiple biodiversity hotspots, and 353 new species (242 plants, 16 amphibians, 16 reptiles, 14 fish, two birds, two mammals and 61+ invertebrates) have been discovered there in between 1998 and 2008, with an average of 35 new species finds every year. With Eastern Himalaya included, the entire Hindu Kush Himalaya region is home to an estimated 35,000+\u2009species of plants and 200+\u2009species of animals.\nHistory.\nThe high altitudes of the mountains have historical significance in South and Central Asia. The Hindu Kush range was a major center of Buddhism with sites such as the Bamiyan Buddhas. It has also been the passageway during the invasions of the Indian subcontinent, a region where the Taliban and al-Qaeda grew, and a scene of modern era warfare in Afghanistan. Ancient mines producing lapis lazuli are found in Kowkcheh Valley, while gem-grade emeralds are found north of Kabul in the valley of the Panjsher River and some of its tributaries. According to Walter Schumann, the West Hindu Kush mountains have been the source of the finest Lapis lazuli for thousands of years.\nBuddhism was widespread in the ancient Hindu Kush region. The ancient artwork of Buddhism includes the giant rock-carved statues called the Bamiyan Buddhas, in the southern and western end of the Hindu Kush. These statues were destroyed by Taliban Islamists in 2001. The southeastern valleys of Hindu Kush connecting towards the Indus Valley region were a major center that hosted monasteries, religious scholars from distant lands, trade networks and merchants of the ancient Indian subcontinent.\nOne of the early Buddhist schools, the Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika-Lokottarav\u0101da, was prominent in the area of Bamiyan. The Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang visited a Lokottarav\u0101da monastery in the 7th century CE, at Bamiyan, Afghanistan. Birchbark and palm leaf manuscripts of texts in this monastery's collection, including Mah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btras, have been discovered in the caves of Hindu Kush, and these are now a part of the Sch\u00f8yen Collection. Some manuscripts are in the G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b language and Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b script, while others are in Sanskrit and written in forms of the Gupta script.\nAccording to Alfred Foucher, the Hindu Kush and nearby regions gradually converted to Buddhism by the 1st century CE, and this region was the base from where Buddhism crossed the Hindu Kush expanding into the Oxus valley region of Central Asia. Buddhism later disappeared and locals were forced to convert to Islam. Richard Bulliet also proposes that the area north of Hindu Kush was center of a new sect that had spread as far as Kurdistan, remaining in existence until the Abbasid times. The area eventually came under the control of the Hindu Shahi dynasty of Kabul. The Islamic conquest of the area happened under Sabuktigin who conquered Jayapala's dominion west of Peshawar in the 10th century.\nAncient.\nThe significance of the Hindu Kush mountain ranges has been recorded since the time of Darius I of the Achaemenid Empire. Alexander entered the Indian subcontinent through the Hindu Kush as his army moved past the Afghan Valleys in the spring of 329 BCE. He moved towards the Indus Valley river region in the Indian subcontinent in 327 BCE;_his armies built several towns in this region over the intervening two years.\nAfter Alexander died in 323 BCE, the region became part of the Seleucid Empire, according to the ancient history of Strabo written in the 1st century BCE, before it became a part of the Indian Maurya Empire around 305 BCE. The region became a part of the Kushan Empire around the start of the common era.\nMedieval era.\nThe lands north of the Hindu Kush, in the Hephthalite dominion, Buddhism was the predominant religion by mid 1st millennium CE. These Buddhists were religiously tolerant and they co-existed with followers of Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism, and Nestorian Christianity. This Central Asia region along the Hindu Kush was taken over by Western Turks and Arabs by the eighth century, facing wars with mostly Iranians. One major exception was the period in the mid to late seventh century when the Tang dynasty from China destroyed the Northern Turks and extended its rule all the way to the Oxus River valley and regions of Central Asia bordering all along the Hindu Kush.\nThe subcontinent and valleys of the Hindu Kush remained unconquered by the Islamic armies until the 9th century, even though they had conquered the southern regions of the Indus River valley such as Sind. Kabul fell to the army of Al-Ma'mun, the seventh Abbasid caliph, in 808 and the local king agreed to accept Islam and pay annual tributes to the caliph. However, states Andr\u00e9 Wink, inscriptional evidence suggests that the Kabul area near Hindu Kush had an early presence of Islam. When the extraction of silver from the mines in the Hindu Kush was at its greatest (c.850), the value of silver in relation to gold dropped, and the content of silver in the Carolingian \"denarius\" was increased so that it should maintain its intrinsic value.\nThe range came under the control of the Hindu Shahi dynasty of Kabul but was conquered by Sabuktigin who took all of Jayapala's dominion west of Peshawar.\nMahmud of Ghazni came to power in 998 CE, in Ghazna, Afghanistan, south of Kabul and the Hindu Kush range. He began a military campaign that rapidly brought both sides of the Hindu Kush range under his rule. From his mountainous Afghani base, he systematically raided and plundered kingdoms in north India from east of the Indus river to west of Yamuna river seventeen times between 997 and 1030.\nMahmud of Ghazni raided the treasuries of kingdoms, sacked cities, and destroyed Hindu temples, with each campaign starting every spring, but he and his army returned to Ghazni and the Hindu Kush base before monsoons arrived in the northwestern part of the subcontinent. He retracted each time, only extending Islamic rule into western Punjab.\nIn 1017, the Iranian Islamic historian Al-Biruni was deported after a war that Mahmud of Ghazni won, to the northwest Indian subcontinent under Mahmud's rule. Al Biruni stayed in the region for about fifteen years, learnt Sanskrit, and translated many Indian texts, and wrote about Indian society, culture, sciences, and religion in Persian and Arabic. He stayed for some time in the Hindu Kush region, particularly near Kabul. In 1019, he recorded and described a solar eclipse in what is the modern era Laghman Province of Afghanistan through which Hindu Kush pass. Al Biruni also wrote about early history of the Hindu Kush region and Kabul kings, who ruled the region long before he arrived, but this history is inconsistent with other records available from that era. Al Biruni was supported by Sultan Mahmud. Al Biruni found it difficult to get access to Indian literature locally in the Hindu Kush area, and to explain this he wrote, \"Mahmud utterly ruined the prosperity of the country, and performed wonderful exploits by which the Hindus became the atoms scattered in all directions, and like a tale of old in the mouth of the people. (...) This is the reason, too, why Hindu sciences have retired far from those parts of the country conquered by us, and have fled to places which our hand cannot yet reach, to Kashmir, Benares and other places\".\nIn the late 12th century, the historically influential Ghurid empire led by Mu'izz al-Din ruled the Hindu Kush region. He was influential in seeding the Delhi Sultanate, shifting the base of his Sultanate from south of the Hindu Kush range and Ghazni towards the Yamuna River and Delhi. He thus helped bring Islamic rule to the northern plains of the Indian subcontinent. In the Mongol invasion of the Khwarazmian Empire, Genghis Khan invaded the region from the northeast in one of his many conquests to create the huge Mongol Empire. \nThe Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta arrived in the Delhi Sultanate by passing through the Hindu Kush. The mountain passes of the Hindu Kush range were used by Timur and his army and they crossed to launch the 1398 invasion of the northern Indian subcontinent. Timur, also known as Temur or Tamerlane in Western scholarly literature, marched with his army to Delhi, plundering and killing all the way. He arrived in the capital Delhi with his army. Then he carried the wealth and the captured slaves, returning to his capital through the Hindu Kush.\nBabur, the founder of the Mughal Empire, was a patrilineal descendant of Timur with roots in Central Asia. He first established himself and his army in Kabul and the Hindu Kush region. In 1526, he made his move into north India, and won the Battle of Panipat, ending the last Delhi Sultanate dynasty, and starting the era of the Mughals.\nSlavery.\nSlavery, as with all major ancient and medieval societies, has been a part of Central Asia and South Asia history. The Hindu Kush mountain passes connected the slave markets of Central Asia with slaves seized in South Asia. The seizure and transportation of slaves from the Indian subcontinent became intense in and after the 8th century CE, with evidence suggesting that the slave transport involved \"hundreds of thousands\" of slaves from India in different periods of Islamic rule era. According to John Coatsworth and others, the slave trading operations during the pre-Akbar Mughal and Delhi Sultanate era \"sent thousands of Hindus every year north to Central Asia to pay for horses and other goods\". However, the interaction between Central Asia and South Asia through the Hindu Kush was not limited to slavery, it included trading in food, goods, horses and weapons.\nThe practice of raiding tribes, hunting, and kidnapping people for slave trading continued through the 19th century, at an extensive scale, around the Hindu Kush. According to a British Anti-Slavery Society report of 1874, the governor of Faizabad, Mir Ghulam Bey, kept 8,000 horses and cavalrymen who routinely captured non-Muslims as well as Shia Muslims as slaves. Others alleged to be involved in the slave trade were feudal lords such as Ameer Sheer Ali. The isolated communities in the Hindu Kush were one of the targets of these slave-hunting expeditions.\nModern era.\nThe people of Kafiristan had practiced ancient polytheistic traditions until the 1896 invasion and conversion to Islam at the hands of Afghans under Amir Abdur Rahman Khan.\nBritish era\nThe Hindu Kush served as a geographical barrier to the British Empire, leading to a paucity of information and scarce direct interaction between the British colonial officials and Central Asian peoples. The British had to rely on tribal chiefs, Sadozai and Barakzai noblemen for information, and they generally downplayed the reports of slavery and other violence for geo-political strategic considerations. The first British invasion of Afghanistan ended in disaster in 1842, when 16,000 British soldiers and camp followers were massacred as they retreated through the Hindu Kush back to India.\nAfter 1947\nIn the colonial era, the Hindu Kush was considered, informally, the dividing line between Russian and British areas of influence in Afghanistan. During the Cold War the Hindu Kush range became a strategic theatre, especially during the 1980s when Soviet forces and their Afghan allies fought the Afghan mujahideen channelled through Pakistan. After the Soviet withdrawal and the end of the Cold War, many mujahideen morphed into Taliban and al-Qaeda forces imposing a strict interpretation of Islamic law (Sharia), with Kabul, these mountains, and other parts of Afghanistan as their base. Other Mujahideen joined the Northern Alliance to oppose the Taliban rule.\nAfter the 11 September 2001 terror attacks in New York City and Washington D.C., the American and ISAF campaign against Al Qaeda and their Taliban allies made the Hindu Kush once again a militarised conflict zone.\nClimate change.\nThe 2019 Hindu Kush Himalaya Assessment concluded that between 1901 and 2014, the Hindu Kush Himalaya (or HKH) region had already experienced warming of 0.1\u00a0\u00b0C per decade, with the warming rate accelerating to 0.2\u00a0\u00b0C per decade over the past 50 years. Over the past 50 years, the frequency of warm days and nights had also increased by 1.2 days and 1.7 nights per decade, while the frequency of \"extreme\" warm days and nights had increased by 1.26 days and 2.54 nights per decade. There was also a corresponding decline of 0.5 cold days, 0.85 extreme cold days, 1 cold night, and 2.4 extreme cold nights per decade. The length of the growing season has increased by 4.25 days per decade. \nThere is less conclusive evidence of light precipitation becoming less frequent while heavy precipitation became both more frequent and more intense. Finally, since 1970s glaciers have retreated everywhere in the region beside Karakoram, eastern Pamir, and western Kunlun, where there has been an unexpected increase in snowfall. Glacier retreat had been followed by an increase in the number of glacial lakes, some of which may be prone to dangerous floods.\nIn the future, if the Paris Agreement goal of 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C of global warming is not exceeded, warming in the HKH will be at least 0.3\u00a0\u00b0C higher, and at least 0.7\u00a0\u00b0C higher in the hotspots of northwest Himalaya and Karakoram. If the Paris Agreement goals are broken, then the region is expected to warm by 1.7\u20132.4\u00a0\u00b0C in the near future (2036\u20132065) and by 2.2\u20133.3\u00a0\u00b0C (2066\u20132095) near the end of the century under the \"intermediate\" Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5). \nUnder the high-warming RCP8.5 scenario where the annual emissions continue to increase for the rest of the century, the expected regional warming is 2.3\u20133.2\u00a0\u00b0C and 4.2\u20136.5\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. Under all scenarios, winters will warm more than the summers, and the Tibetan Plateau, the central Himalayan Range, and the Karakoram will continue to warm more than the rest of the region. Climate change will also lead to the degradation of up to 81% of the region's permafrost by the end of the century.\nFuture precipitation is projected to increase as well, but CMIP5 models struggle to make specific projections due to the region's topography: the most certain finding is that the monsoon precipitation in the region will increase by 4\u201312% in the near future and by 4\u201325% in the long term. There has also been modelling of the changes in snow cover, but it is limited to the end of century under the RCP 8.5 scenario: it projects declines of 30\u201350% in the Indus Basin, 50\u201360% in the Ganges basin, and 50\u201370% in the Brahmaputra Basin, as the snowline elevation in these regions will rise by between 4.4 and 10.0 m/yr. There has been more extensive modelling of glacier trends: it is projected that one third of all glaciers in the extended HKH region will be lost by 2100 even if the warming is limited to 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C (with over half of that loss in the Eastern Himalaya region), while RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 are likely to lead to the losses of 50% and &gt;67% of the region's glaciers over the same timeframe. \nGlacier melt is projected to accelerate regional river flows until the amount of meltwater peaks around 2060, going into an irreversible decline afterwards. Since precipitation will continue to increase even as the glacier meltwater contribution declines, annual river flows are only expected to diminish in the western basins where contribution from the monsoon is low: however, irrigation and hydropower generation would still have to adjust to greater interannual variability and lower pre-monsoon flows in all of the region's rivers.\nFuture development and adaptation.\nA range of adaptation efforts are already undertaken across the HKH region: however, they suffer from underinvestment and insufficient coordination between the various state, institutional and other non-state efforts, and need to be \"urgently\" strengthened in order to be commensurate with the challenges ahead.\nThe 2019 Hindu Kush Himalaya Assessment outlined three main \"storylines\" for the region between now and 2080: \"business-as-usual\" (or \"muddling through\"), with no significant change from the current trends and development/adaptation initiatives proceeding as they do now; \"downhill\", where the intensity of global climate change is high, local initiatives fail and regional cooperation breaks down; and \"prosperous\", where extensive cooperation allows region's communities to weather \"moderate\" climate change and increase their living standards while also preserving the region's biodiversity. In addition, it described two alternate pathways through which the \"prosperous\" future can be achieved: the first focuses on top-down, large-scale development and the latter describes a bottom-up, decentralized alternative. \nEthnography.\nPre-Islamic populations of the Hindu Kush included Shins, Yeshkuns, Chiliss, Neemchas Koli, Palus, Gaware, and Krammins.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Known for both his comedic and dramatic roles, he is one of the most popular and recognizable film stars worldwide, and is regarded as an American cultural icon. Hanks is ranked as the fourth-highest-grossing American film actor. His numerous awards include two Academy Awards, seven Emmy Awards, and four Golden Globe Awards; he has also been nominated for five BAFTA Awards and a Tony Award. He received the AFI Life Achievement Award in 2002, the Kennedy Center Honor in 2014, the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016, and the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 2020.\nHanks rose to fame with leading roles in the comedies \"Splash\" (1984), \"The Money Pit\" (1986), \"Big\" (1988), and \"A League of Their Own\" (1992). He won two consecutive Academy Awards for Best Actor, playing a gay lawyer suffering from AIDS in \"Philadelphia\" (1993), then the title character in \"Forrest Gump\" (1994). Hanks has collaborated with Steven Spielberg on five films\u2014\"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998), \"Catch Me If You Can\" (2002), \"The Terminal\" (2004), \"Bridge of Spies\" (2015) and \"The Post\" (2017)\u2014and three World War II-themed miniseries: \"Band of Brothers\" (2001), \"The Pacific\" (2010) and \"Masters of the Air\" (2024). He has also frequently collaborated with directors Ron Howard, Nora Ephron and Robert Zemeckis.\nHanks cemented his film stardom with lead roles in the romantic comedies \"Sleepless in Seattle\" (1993) and \"You've Got Mail\" (1998); the dramas \"Apollo 13\" (1995), \"The Green Mile\" (1999), \"Cast Away\" (2000), \"Road to Perdition\" (2002), \"Cloud Atlas\" (2012) and \"News of the World\" (2020); and the biographical dramas \"Charlie Wilson's War\" (2007), \"Captain Phillips\" (2013), \"Saving Mr. Banks\" (2013), \"Sully\" (2016), \"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood\" (2019) and \"Elvis\" (2022). He played the title character in the \"Robert Langdon\" series (2006\u20132016) and voiced Sheriff Woody in the \"Toy Story\" franchise (1995\u2013present) and multiple roles in \"The Polar Express\" (2004). Hanks directed and acted in \"That Thing You Do!\" (1996) and \"Larry Crowne\" (2011).\nHis breakthrough television role was a co-lead in the ABC sitcom \"Bosom Buddies\" (1980\u20131982). He has hosted \"Saturday Night Live\" ten times and launched a production company, Playtone, which has produced various limited series and television movies, including \"From the Earth to the Moon\" (1998), \"Band of Brothers\", \"John Adams\" (2008), \"The Pacific\", \"Game Change\" (2012) and \"Olive Kitteridge\" (2015). He made his Broadway debut in Nora Ephron's \"Lucky Guy\" (2013), earning a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play.\nEarly life, family, and education.\nThomas Jeffrey was born in Concord, California, on July 9, 1956, to hospital worker Janet Marylyn (n\u00e9e\u00a0Frager) and itinerant cook Amos \"Bud\" Hanks. His mother was from a Portuguese family; their surname was originally \"Fraga\". His father had English ancestry, and through his line, Hanks is a distant cousin of Nancy Hanks and her son President Abraham Lincoln and children's host Fred Rogers (who Hanks has portrayed in a film role).\nHanks' parents divorced in 1960. Their three oldest children, Sandra (later Sandra Hanks Benoiton, a writer), Larry (who became an entomology professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign), and Tom, went with their father, while the youngest, Jim (who also became an actor and filmmaker), remained with their mother in Red Bluff, California. In his childhood, Hanks' family moved often. By age ten, he had lived in ten different houses.\nHis family's religious background was Catholic and Mormon. One journalist characterized Hanks' teenage self as being a \"Bible-toting evangelical\" for several years. In school, he was unpopular with students and teachers alike, later telling \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, \"I was a geek, a spaz. I was horribly, painfully, terribly shy. At the same time, I was the guy who'd yell out funny captions during filmstrips. But I didn't get into trouble. I was always a real good kid and pretty responsible.\" Hanks acted in school plays, including \"South Pacific\", while attending Skyline High School in Oakland, California.\nHaving grown up in the Bay Area, Hanks says that some of his first movie memories were seeing movies in the Alameda Theatre. Hanks studied theater at Chabot College in Hayward, California, and transferred to California State University, Sacramento after two years. During a 2001 interview with sportscaster Bob Costas, Hanks was asked whether he would rather have an Oscar or a Heisman Trophy. He replied that he would have rather won a Heisman by playing halfback for the California Golden Bears. He told \"New York\" magazine in 1986, \"Acting classes looked like the best place for a guy who liked to make a lot of noise and be rather flamboyant. I spent a lot of time going to plays. I wouldn't take dates with me. I'd just drive to a theater, buy myself a ticket, sit in the seat and read the program, and then get into the play completely. I spent a lot of time like that, seeing Brecht, Tennessee Williams, Ibsen, and all that.\"\nDuring his years studying theater, Hanks met Vincent Dowling, head of the Great Lakes Theater Festival in Cleveland, Ohio. At Dowling's suggestion, Hanks became an intern at the festival. His internship stretched into a three-year experience that covered most aspects of theater production, including lighting, set design, and stage management, prompting Hanks to drop out of college. During the same time, Hanks won the Cleveland Critics Circle Award for Best Actor for his 1978 performance as Proteus in Shakespeare's \"The Two Gentlemen of Verona\", one of the few times he played a villain.\nCareer.\n1980\u20131989: Early work, sitcom and comedy films.\nIn 1979, Hanks moved to New York City, where he made his film debut in the low-budget slasher film \"He Knows You're Alone\" (1980) and landed a starring role in the television movie \"Mazes and Monsters\" (1982). Early that year, he was cast as the lead, Callimaco, in the Riverside Shakespeare Company's production of Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli's \"The Mandrake\", directed by Daniel Southern. The following year, Hanks landed one of the lead roles, that of character Kip Wilson, on the ABC television pilot of \"Bosom Buddies\". He and Peter Scolari played a pair of young advertising men forced to dress as women so they could live in an inexpensive all-female hotel. Hanks had previously partnered with Scolari on the 1970s game show \"Make Me Laugh\". After landing the role, Hanks moved to Los Angeles. \"Bosom Buddies\" ran for two seasons, and, although the ratings were never strong, television critics gave the program high marks. \"The first day I saw him on the set,\" co-producer Ian Praiser told \"Rolling Stone\", \"I thought, 'Too bad he won't be in television for long.' I knew he'd be a movie star in two years.\"\nHanks made a guest appearance on a 1982 episode of \"Happy Days\" (\"A Case of Revenge\", in which he played a disgruntled former classmate of Fonzie) where he met writers Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel who were writing the film \"Splash\" (1984), a romantic comedy fantasy about a mermaid who falls in love with a human, to be directed by former \"Happy Days\" star Ron Howard. Ganz and Mandel suggested Howard consider Hanks for the film. At first, Howard considered Hanks for the role of the main character's wisecracking brother, a role that eventually went to John Candy. Instead, Hanks landed the lead role in \"Splash\", which went on to become a surprise box office hit, grossing more than US$69\u00a0million. He had a sizable hit with the sex comedy \"Bachelor Party\", also in 1984. In 1983\u201384, Hanks made three guest appearances on \"Family Ties\" as Elyse Keaton's alcoholic brother Ned Donnelly.\nWith \"Nothing in Common\" (1986)\u2014a story of a young man alienated from his father (Jackie Gleason)\u2014Hanks began to extend himself from comedic roles to dramatic. In an interview with \"Rolling Stone\", Hanks commented on his experience: \"It changed my desires about working in movies. Part of it was the nature of the material, what we were trying to say. But besides that, it focused on people's relationships. The story was about a guy and his father, unlike, say, \"The Money Pit\", where the story is really about a guy and his house.\" In 1987, he had signed an agreement with The Walt Disney Studios where he had starred to a talent pool in an acting/producing pact. After a few more flops and a moderate success with the comedy \"Dragnet\" (1987), Hanks' stature in the film industry rose.\nThe broad success of the fantasy comedy \"Big\" (1988) established Hanks as a major Hollywood talent, both as a box office draw and within the industry as an actor. For his performance in the film, Hanks earned his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. \"Big\" was followed later that year by \"Punchline\", in which he and Sally Field co-starred as struggling comedians. Hanks then suffered a run of box-office underperformers: \"The 'Burbs\" (1989), \"Joe Versus the Volcano\" (1990) and \"The Bonfire of the Vanities\" (1990). In the last, he portrayed a greedy Wall Street figure who gets enmeshed in a hit-and-run accident. \"Turner &amp; Hooch\" (1989) was Hanks' only financially successful film of the period.\n1990\u20131999: Leading man and acclaim.\nHanks climbed back to the top again with his portrayal of a washed-up baseball legend turned manager in Penny Marshall's \"A League of Their Own\" (1992). Hanks has said that his acting in earlier roles had not been great, but that he later improved. In an interview with \"Vanity Fair\", Hanks called attention to what he called his \"modern era of moviemaking\u00a0... because enough self-discovery has gone on\u00a0... My work has become less pretentiously fake and over the top\". This \"modern era\" began in 1993 for Hanks, first with Nora Ephron's \"Sleepless in Seattle\" and then with Jonathan Demme's \"Philadelphia\".\n\"Sleepless in Seattle\" is a romantic comedy about a widower who finds true love over the radio airwaves. Hanks co-starred with Meg Ryan. Richard Schickel of \"TIME\" called his performance \"charming\", and most critics agreed that Hanks' portrayal ensured him a place among the premier romantic-comedy stars of his generation. In \"Philadelphia\", he played a gay lawyer with AIDS who sues his firm for discrimination. Hanks lost and thinned his hair in order to appear sickly for the role. In a review for \"People\", Leah Rozen stated, \"Above all, credit for \"Philadelphia\"'s success belongs to Hanks, who makes sure that he plays a character, not a saint. He is flat-out terrific, giving a deeply felt, carefully nuanced performance that deserves an Oscar.\" Hanks won the 1993 Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in \"Philadelphia\". During his acceptance speech, he revealed that two people with whom he was close, his high school drama teacher Rawley Farnsworth and his former classmate John Gilkerson, were gay.\nHanks followed \"Philadelphia\" with Robert Zemeckis's \"Forrest Gump\" (1994), playing the title character, a man with an IQ of 75 who happens to find himself involved with some of the major events in recent American history. It grossed a worldwide total of more than $600\u00a0million. Hanks remarked, \"When I read the script for \"Gump\", I saw it as one of those kind of grand, hopeful movies that the audience can go to and feel\u00a0... some hope for their lot and their position in life\u00a0... I got that from the movies a hundred million times when I was a kid. I still do.\" Hanks won his second Best Actor Academy Award for his role in \"Forrest Gump\", becoming only the second actor to have accomplished the feat of winning consecutive Best Actor Oscars. (Spencer Tracy was the first, winning in 1937 and \u201838 for \"Captains Courageous\" and \"Boys Town\". Hanks and Tracy were the same age at the time they received their Academy Awards: 37 years old when they won their first and 38 when they won their second.)\nHanks reunited with Ron Howard to play astronaut and commander Jim Lovell in \"Apollo 13\" (1995). Critics generally applauded the film and the performances of the entire cast, which included Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris and Kathleen Quinlan. The movie earned nine Academy Award nominations, winning two. Hanks also starred in Pixar's \"Toy Story\" (1995) as the voice of Sheriff Woody. Hanks made his directing debut with \"That Thing You Do!\" (1996), about a 1960s pop group; he also played the role of a music producer in the film. Hanks and producer Gary Goetzman went on to create Playtone, a record and film production company named after the record company in the film.\nHanks then executive produced, co-wrote and co-directed the HBO docudrama \"From the Earth to the Moon\" (1998). The 12-part series chronicled the space program from its inception, through the familiar flights of Neil Armstrong and Jim Lovell, to the personal feelings surrounding the reality of Moon landings. The Emmy Award\u2013winning project was, at $68\u00a0million (equivalent to $\u00a0million in 2024), one of the most expensive ventures undertaken for television.\nFor \"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998), he worked with Steven Spielberg to make a film about a search through war-torn France after D-Day to bring home a soldier. It earned the praise and respect of the film community, critics and the general public. Hailed as one of the finest war films ever made, it earned Spielberg his second Academy Award for direction, and Hanks another Best Actor nomination. Later that year, Hanks re-teamed with Ephron and Ryan for \"You've Got Mail\", a remake of Ernst Lubitsch's \"The Shop Around the Corner\" (1940). He starred in Frank Darabont's \"The Green Mile\" (1999), based on the novel of the same name by Stephen King. Hanks reprised the role of Woody in \"Toy Story 2\" (1999).\n2000\u20132009: Established star and expansion.\nHanks reunited with Zemeckis for \"Cast Away\" (2000), playing a marooned FedEx systems analyst. Roger Ebert of \"The Chicago Sun-Times\" wrote: \"Hanks proves here again what an effective actor he is, never straining for an effect, always persuasive even in this unlikely situation, winning our sympathy with his eyes and his body language when there's no one else on the screen.\" Hanks co-directed and produced the Emmy Award-winning HBO miniseries \"Band of Brothers\" (2001). He also appeared in the September 11 television special \"\" and the documentary \"Rescued From the Closet\". In 2002, he teamed up with Sam Mendes for \"Road to Perdition\", an adaptation of the adaptation of Max Allan Collins's and Richard Piers Rayner's comics, in which he played an anti-hero role as a hitman on the run with his son. Hanks reunited with Spielberg, starring opposite Leonardo DiCaprio in \"Catch Me If You Can\" (2002), based on the true story of conman Frank Abagnale, Jr. Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson produced \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\" (2002). In August 2007, Hanks, along with co-producers Wilson and Gary Goetzman and writer and star Nia Vardalos, initiated a legal action against the production company Gold Circle Films for their share of profits from the movie. At the age of 45, Hanks became the youngest-ever recipient of the American Film Institute's Life Achievement Award on June 12, 2002.\nIn 2004, he appeared in three films: The Coen brothers' \"The Ladykillers\", Spielberg's \"The Terminal\" and Zemeckis' \"The Polar Express\", a family film for which Hanks played multiple motion capture roles. In a \"USA Weekend\" interview, Hanks discussed how he chooses projects: \"[Since] \"A League of Their Own\", it can't be just another movie for me. It has to get me going somehow\u00a0... There has to be some all-encompassing desire or feeling about wanting to do that particular movie. I'd like to assume that I'm willing to go down any avenue in order to do it right\". In August 2005, Hanks was voted in as vice president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Hanks next starred in \"The Da Vinci Code\" (2006), which grossed over US$750\u00a0million worldwide. In 2006, Hanks topped a 1,500-strong list of \"most trusted celebrities\" compiled by \"Forbes\" magazine. He produced the animated children's movie \"The Ant Bully\" and \"Starter for Ten\", a comedy about working-class students attempting to win on \"University Challenge\".\nHanks did voice work for Ken Burns's documentary \"The War\" (2007), reading excerpts from World War II-era columns by Al McIntosh. Hanks voiced himself in \"The Simpsons Movie\" (2007), in which he appeared in an announcement claiming that the U.S. government has lost its credibility and is hence buying some of his. He also made an appearance in the credits, expressing a desire to be left alone when he is out in public. He starred in Mike Nichols's \"Charlie Wilson's War\" (2007) as Democratic Texas Congressman Charles Wilson. In the comedy-drama film \"The Great Buck Howard\" (2008), Hanks played the on-screen father of a young man (played by Hanks' real-life son Colin) who chooses to work as road manager for a fading mentalist (John Malkovich). His character was less than thrilled about his son's career decision. In the same year, he executive produced the musical comedy \"Mamma Mia!\" and the miniseries \"John Adams\".\nHanks' next endeavor was \"Angels &amp; Demons\" (2009). Its April 11, 2007, announcement revealed that Hanks would reprise his role as Robert Langdon, and that he would reportedly receive the highest salary ever for an actor. The following day he made his 10th appearance on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\", impersonating himself for the \"Celebrity Jeopardy\" sketch. Hanks produced Spike Jonze's \"Where The Wild Things Are\" (2009), based on the children's book by Maurice Sendak.\n2010\u20132019: Broadway debut and other roles.\nHanks reprised his role of Woody in \"Toy Story 3\" (2010) after he, Tim Allen and John Ratzenberger were invited to a movie theater to see a complete story reel of the movie. The film went on to become the highest-grossing animated film at the time. He executive produced the miniseries \"The Pacific\" (2010). In 2011, he directed and starred opposite Julia Roberts in the title role in the romantic comedy \"Larry Crowne\". The movie received poor reviews, with only 35% of the 175 Rotten Tomatoes reviews giving it high ratings. Also in 2011, he starred in the drama \"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close\". In 2012, he voiced the character Cleveland Carr for a web series he created, \"Electric City\". He played multiple parts in \"Cloud Atlas\" (2012), based on the novel of the same name by David Mitchell, and was executive producer of the miniseries \"Game Change\".\nIn 2013, Hanks starred in two critically acclaimed films\u2014Paul Greengrass's \"Captain Phillips\" and John Lee Hancock's \"Saving Mr. Banks\"\u2014which earned him praise, including nominations for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama for the former role. In \"Captain Phillips\", he starred as Captain Richard Phillips with Barkhad Abdi, which was based on the Maersk Alabama hijacking. In \"Saving Mr. Banks\", co-starring Emma Thompson, he was the first actor to portray Walt Disney in a mainstream film. That same year, Hanks made his Broadway debut, starring in Nora Ephron's \"Lucky Guy\", for which he was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play.\nIn 2014, Hanks' short story \"Alan Bean Plus Four\" was published in \"The New Yorker\". Revolving around four friends who make a voyage to the moon, the short story is titled after the Apollo 12 astronaut Alan Bean. \"Slate\" magazine's Katy Waldman found his first published short story \"mediocre\", writing that \"Hanks' shopworn ideas about technology might have yet sung if they hadn't been wrapped in too-clever lit mag-ese\". In an interview with \"The New Yorker\", Hanks said he has always been fascinated by space. He told the magazine that he built plastic models of rockets when he was a child and watched live broadcasts of space missions back in the 1960s.\nIn March 2015, Hanks appeared in the music video for Carly Rae Jepsen's \"I Really Like You\", lip-syncing most of the song's lyrics as he goes through his daily routine. His next film was Steven Spielberg's \"Bridge of Spies\" (2015), in which he played lawyer James B. Donovan, who negotiated for the release of pilot Francis Gary Powers by the Soviet Union in exchange for KGB spy Rudolf Abel. In April 2016, Hanks starred as Alan Clay in the comedy-drama \"A Hologram for the King\", an adaptation of the 2012 novel of the same name. It is the second time he was directed by Tom Tykwer after \"Cloud Atlas\".\nHanks starred as airline captain Chesley Sullenberger in Clint Eastwood's \"Sully\" (2016).

This is the first episode of \"SNL\" to debut after the show's hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic; it features different sketches filmed remotely from the cast members' homes. This is also a first in \"SNL\" history, for the show to be made up entirely of prerecorded content before airing, and the second to not be filmed at Studio 8H.\nHanks had two films released in 2020. Hanks starred in \"Greyhound\", a war film which he also wrote the screenplay for. Initially set to be theatrically released in June 2020 by Sony Pictures, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, distribution rights to the film were bought by Apple TV+, where it was released in July 2020. He reunited with Paul Greengrass for the Western \"News of the World\". David Rooney of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" praised Hanks' performance: \"Hanks has built a career out of playing thoroughly decent men, so his casting here is entirely to type. But the soulfulness and sorrow, the innate compassion that ripple through his characterization make this an enormously pleasurable performance to watch, with new depths of both kindness and regret that keep revealing themselves.\"\nIn 2021, Hanks starred in the science fiction drama \"Finch\", directed by Miguel Sapochnik, and released by Apple TV+. On March 2, 2022, Connor Ratliff appeared as a guest on \"Late Night with Seth Meyers,\" where he revealed that Hanks would at last be interviewed for the season three finale of Ratliff's podcast \"Dead Eyes\". The conversation between Hanks and Ratliff took place 22 years after Ratliff was about to begin filming an episode of \"Band of Brothers\", when he was subsequently fired, allegedly because Hanks believed Ratliff had \"dead eyes\". The 90 minute interview was hailed as a momentous achievement in podcasting, a \"rare show that gives you a perfect conclusion\", \"surprisingly funny and empathetic\", and an event Paul Scheer called \"thrilling\".\nHanks had three films released in 2022. He first starred as Tom Parker, the manager of Elvis Presley, in Baz Luhrmann's \"Elvis\". Shooting commenced in the beginning of 2020 in Queensland, Australia, and the film was released in June 2022.

In the process in the final minutes of the program, in which the guest chooses his/her favorite of the eight discs (pieces of music) just played, a book, and a luxury item, he chose Richard Strauss' \"Also sprach Zarathustra\" by the Vienna Philharmonic, \"A World Lit Only by Fire\" by William Manchester, and a Hermes 3000 typewriter and paper, respectively.\nHanks was interviewed five times on WHYY-FM by Terry Gross on the radio show \"Fresh Air\" in Philadelphia. Topics included two segments on his lead role in \"Captain Phillips\", a movie about the real life story of a ship's captain hijacked by Somali pirates. Two interviews are about the 12 part miniseries \"From Earth to the Moon\", for which Hanks was executive producer and which was nominated for 17 Emmy Awards. The last interview segment comprises anecdotes shared by Hanks about his acting career.\nRoger Ebert wrote \"of actors who are not 'bigger than life,' but somehow just like life\u2014people who we feel we know and understand, and are comfortable with. We sense that these actors embody not our fantasies, but our lives. Watching them we feel congratulated, because we are watching ourselves. They reassure us that in our ordinariness we also have a kind of importance. The actors who can do that\u2014Buster Keaton, Spencer Tracy, James Stewart, Henry Fonda, Robert Duvall, Gene Hackman, and Tom Hanks, occupy a special category... The central triumph of Tom Hanks as a movie actor is that, most of the time, we believe he thinks a lot like us, and does more or less what we would do, but that he somehow does it on a larger or more ennobling scale. It is the James Stewart quality. But few actors can obtain it; with most, you see their egos peeking through, or you catch them trying too hard. The camera is a lie detector, and Hanks must be a fundamentally good person to play such roles\u2014either that, or he is an even better actor than we think.\"\nPersonal life.\nMarriage and family.\nHanks married American actress Samantha Lewes (1952\u20132002) in 1978. They had one son, actor Colin (b. 1977), and one daughter, Elizabeth (b. 1982). Hanks and Lewes divorced in 1987. Lewes died in 2002 at the age of 49 from bone cancer.\nIn 1981, Hanks met actress Rita Wilson on the set of the TV comedy \"Bosom Buddies\" (1980\u20131982). They were reunited in 1985 on the set of \"Volunteers\". Wilson is of Greek and Bulgarian descent and a member of the Greek Orthodox Church. Before marrying her, Hanks converted to her faith. He actively attends church and has commented, \"I must say that when I go to church\u2014and I do go to church\u2014I ponder the mystery. I meditate on the 'why?' of 'why people are as they are' and 'why bad things happen to good people,' and 'why good things happen to bad people'... The mystery is what I think is, almost, the grand unifying theory of all mankind.\" Hanks and Wilson married in 1988 and have two sons. Their older son, Chet, released a rap song in 2011 and had recurring roles in \"Empire\" and \"Shameless\". Their younger son, Truman, was born in 1995, and portrayed the younger version of his father's character in \"A Man Called Otto\" (2022). Hanks lives with his family in Los Angeles, California, and Ketchum, Idaho.\nIn October 2013, on \"Late Show with David Letterman\", Hanks said he has type 2 diabetes. The CBS News medical contributor said significant weight fluctuations for various film roles such as \"A League of Their Own\" and \"Cast Away\" might have contributed to the diagnosis. In a 2018 interview, Hanks further attributed his condition to a combination of genetics and lifestyle choices. He has since made lifestyle changes to manage his condition, such as maintaining a healthier diet and avoiding film roles that require drastic weight changes.\nDespite being a fan of the Oakland Athletics and the Raiders when they were based in Oakland, Hanks stated in April 2017 he would boycott the NFL for two years after the Raiders filed for relocation to Las Vegas. Since 1984, Hanks has been a fan of the English Premier League club Aston Villa.\nIn November 2019, shortly before the release of \"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood\", a drama film in which Hanks portrays Fred Rogers, he learned through Ancestry.com that he and Rogers were sixth cousins, both descendants of Johannes Meffert (1732\u20131795), who was born in Sch\u00f6neck, Hesse, Germany (then part of the Holy Roman Empire) and emigrated to the United States in the 18th century, settling in Kentucky and changing his last name to Mefford. Hanks is also a relative of the 16th US president, Abraham Lincoln. Hanks narrated the 2011 television program \"Killing Lincoln\".\nOn December 27, 2019, the President of Greece, Prokopis Pavlopoulos, signed an honorary naturalization order for Hanks and his family, citing their \"exceptional services to Greece\", thus making him and his immediate family Greek citizens. Hanks, along with Wilson and their children, were conferred honorary citizenship for their role in bringing global attention and appealing for aid after a devastating wildfire that ripped through the seaside village of Mati, near Athens, in July 2018, which killed more than 100 people. Greece's Interior Minister Takis Theodorikakos said Hanks \"showed real interest in the people who suffered from the fire in Mati and promoted this issue in the global media\". In July 2020, Hanks and Wilson were photographed with their Greek passports alongside the Prime Minister of Greece, Kyriakos Mitsotakis and his wife.\nPolitical views and activism.\nHanks has donated to many Democratic politicians, and during the 2008 United States presidential election uploaded a video to his MySpace account endorsing Barack Obama. He also narrated a 2012 documentary, \"The Road We've Traveled,\" created by Obama for America. In 2016, Hanks endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.\nHanks was outspoken about his opposition to the 2008 Proposition8, an amendment to the California constitution that defined marriage as a union only between a man and a woman. Hanks and others raised over US$44\u00a0million to campaign against the proposition. While premiering a TV series in January 2009, Hanks called supporters of Proposition8 \"un-American\" and criticized LDS Church members, who were major proponents of the bill, for their views on marriage and role in supporting the bill. About a week later, he apologized for the remark, saying that nothing is more American than voting one's conscience.\nA proponent of environmentalism, Hanks is an investor in electric vehicles and owns a Toyota RAV4 EV and the first production AC Propulsion eBox. He was a lessee of an EV1 before it was recalled, as chronicled in the documentary \"Who Killed the Electric Car?\" He was on the waiting list for an Aptera2 Series. Hanks serves as campaign chair of the Hidden Heroes Campaign of the Elizabeth Dole Foundation. The stated mission of the campaign is to inspire a national movement to more effectively support the military and veteran caregivers.\nIn 2004, while touring the White House, Hanks learned that the press corps did not have a coffee pot, and shortly thereafter, he donated an espresso machine. He again donated new machines in 2010 and 2017. His 2017 donation was accompanied by a note that read, \"To the White House Press Corps, Keep up the good fight for Truth, Justice, and the American Way. Especially for the truth part.\" He endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.\nVentures and interests.\nA supporter of NASA's crewed space program, Hanks said he originally wanted to be an astronaut. Hanks is a member of the National Space Society, serving on the Board of governors of the nonprofit educational space advocacy organization founded by Wernher von Braun. He also produced the HBO miniseries \"From the Earth to the Moon\" about the Apollo program to send astronauts to the Moon. In addition, Hanks co-wrote and co-produced \"\", an IMAX film about the Moon landings. Hanks provided the voice-over for the premiere of the show \"Passport to the Universe\" at the Rose Center for Earth and Space in the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York.\nIn 2006, the Space Foundation awarded Hanks the Douglas S. Morrow Public Outreach Award, given annually to an individual or organization that has made significant contributions to public awareness of space programs.\nIn June 2006, Hanks was inducted as an honorary member of the United States Army Rangers Hall of Fame for his accurate portrayal of a captain in the movie \"Saving Private Ryan\"; Hanks, who was unable to attend the induction ceremony, was the first actor to receive such an honor. In addition to his role in \"Saving Private Ryan\", Hanks was cited for serving as the national spokesperson for the World War II Memorial Campaign, for being the honorary chairperson of the D-Day Museum Capital Campaign, and for his role in writing and helping to produce the Emmy Award-winning miniseries, \"Band of Brothers\". On March 10, 2008, Hanks was on hand at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to induct The Dave Clark Five.\nHanks is a collector of manual typewriters which he began collecting in his youth and which he uses almost daily. Hank has gifted typewriters including to a child who was being bullied because of his name, which happened to also be a brand of typewriter. In August 2014, Hanks released Hanx Writer, an iOS app meant to emulate the experience of using a typewriter; within days the free app reached number one on the App Store. After contracting and recovering from a COVID-19 infection early in the pandemic, Hanks and his wife donated their blood antibodies for virus research. Hanks is an ordained minister, and on March 24, 2022, CBS News reported that he had recently officiated a wedding in Pittsburgh.\nIn 2023, Hanks founded Hanx for the Troops, a coffee company that supports veterans and military families through a portion of its profits and various initiatives. In recognition of Hanks' positive portrayal of the American service member, his support of veterans, the military, and America's space program, he was to receive the 2025 Sylvanus Thayer Award from the West Point Association of Graduates (WPAOG), but the ceremony was cancelled.\nBibliography.\nHanks wrote a collection of short stories, \"Uncommon Type\", inspired by his typewriter collection, which was published in 2017. \"The Making of Another Major Motion Picture Masterpiece\", his debut novel, was published in May 2023.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "43569", "revid": "50803724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43569", "title": "Ghost town", "text": "Abandoned settlement with intact features\nA ghost town, deserted city, extinct town, or abandoned city is an abandoned settlement, usually one that contains substantial visible remaining buildings and infrastructure such as roads. A town often becomes a ghost town because the economic activity that supported it (usually industrial or agricultural) has failed or ended for any reason (e.g. a host ore deposit exhausted by mining). The town may have also declined because of natural or human-caused disasters such as floods, prolonged droughts, extreme heat or extreme cold, government actions, uncontrolled lawlessness, war, pollution, or nuclear and radiation-related accidents and incidents. The term can sometimes refer to cities, towns, and neighborhoods that, though still populated, are significantly less so than in past years; for example, those affected by high levels of unemployment and dereliction.\nSome ghost towns, especially those that preserve period-specific architecture, have become tourist attractions. Some examples are Bannack, Montana and Oatman, Arizona in the United States; Barkerville, British Columbia in Canada; Craco and Pompeii in Italy; Aghdam in Azerbaijan; Kolmanskop in Namibia; Pripyat and Chernobyl in Ukraine; Dhanushkodi in India; Fordl\u00e2ndia in Brazil and Villa Epecu\u00e9n in Argentina.\nDefinition.\nT. Lindsey Baker, author of \"Ghost Towns of Texas\", defines a ghost town as \"a town for which the reason for being no longer exists.\" Some writers discount settlements that were abandoned as a result of a natural or human-made disaster or other causes; they restrict the term to settlements that were deserted because they were no longer economically viable. Some believe that any settlement with visible tangible remains should not be called a ghost town; others say, conversely, that a ghost town should contain the tangible remains of buildings. Whether or not the settlement must be completely deserted, or may contain a small population, is also a matter for debate. Generally, though, the term is used in a looser sense, encompassing any and all of these definitions. American author Lambert Florin defined a ghost town as \"a shadowy semblance of a former self.\"\nReasons for abandonment.\nFactors leading to the abandonment of towns include depleted natural resources, economic activity shifting elsewhere, railroads and roads bypassing or no longer accessing the town, human intervention, disasters, massacres, wars, the shifting of politics or fall of empires, and volcanic eruptions. A town can also be abandoned when it is part of an exclusion zone due to natural or human-made causes.\nEconomic decline.\nGhost towns may result when the single activity or resource that created a boomtown (e.g., nearby mine, mill or resort) is depleted or the resource economy undergoes a \"bust\" (e.g., catastrophic resource price collapse). A gold rush often brought intensive but short-lived economic activity to a remote village, only to leave a ghost town once the resource was depleted.\nBoomtowns can often decrease in size as quickly as they grew. Sometimes, all, or nearly all, of the population can desert the town, resulting in a ghost town. The dismantling of a boomtown can often occur on a planned basis. Mining companies nowadays will create a temporary company town to service a mine site, building all the accommodations, shops and services required, and then remove them once the resource has been extracted. Modular buildings can be used to facilitate the process.\nIn some cases, multiple factors may remove the economic basis for a community; some former mining towns on U.S. Route 66 suffered both mine closures when the resources were depleted and loss of highway traffic as US 66 was diverted from places like Oatman, Arizona, onto a more direct path. Mine and pulp mill closures have led to many ghost towns in British Columbia, Canada, including several relatively recent ones: Ocean Falls, which closed in 1973 after the pulp mill was decommissioned; Kitsault, whose molybdenum mine shut down after only 18 months in 1982; and Cassiar, whose asbestos mine operated from 1952 to 1992.\nIn other cases, the reason for abandonment can arise from a town's intended economic function shifting to another, nearby place. This happened to Collingwood, Queensland, in Outback Australia when nearby Winton outperformed Collingwood as a regional centre for the livestock-raising industry. The railway reached Winton in 1899, linking it with the rest of Queensland, and Collingwood was a ghost town by the following year. More broadly across Australia, there has been a shift towards fly-in fly-out arrangements over building a company town, in order to avoid the development of ghost towns once a mining resource has been fully extracted.\nThe Middle East has many ghost towns and ruins that were created when the shifting of politics or the fall of empires caused capital cities to be socially or economically unviable, such as Ctesiphon.\nThe rise of real-estate speculation and the resulting possibility of real-estate bubbles (sometimes due to outright overbuilding by land developers) may also trigger the appearance of certain elements of a ghost town, as real-estate prices initially rise (whereupon affordable housing becomes less available) and then later fall for a variety of reasons that are often tied to economic cycles and/or marketing hubris. This has been observed to occur in various countries, including Spain, China, the United States, and Canada, where housing is often used as an investment rather than for habitation.\nHuman intervention and infrastructure.\nRailroads and roads bypassing or no longer reaching a town can also create a ghost town. This was the case in many of the ghost towns along Ontario's historic Opeongo Line, and along U.S. Route 66 after motorists bypassed the latter on the faster moving highways I-44 and I-40. Some ghost towns were founded along railways where steam trains would stop at periodic intervals for repairs or to take on water, but dieselization or electrification negated the need for the trains to stop. Amboy, California, was part of one such series of villages along the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad across the Mojave Desert. In other cases, railroads replaced rivers or canals as the primary means of overland transport, causing the decline of towns that depended on river or canal traffic; one such town was Granville, Indiana, located on the Wabash and Erie Canal. \nRiver re-routing is another factor, one example being the towns along the Aral Sea.\nGhost towns may be created when land is expropriated by a government, and residents are required to relocate. One example is the village of Tyneham in Dorset, England, acquired during World War II to build an artillery range.\nA similar situation occurred in the U.S. when NASA acquired land to construct the John C. Stennis Space Center (SSC), a rocket testing facility in Hancock County, Mississippi (on the Mississippi side of the Pearl River, which is the Mississippi\u2013Louisiana state line). This required NASA to acquire a large (approximately ) buffer zone because of the loud noise and potential dangers associated with testing such rockets. Five thinly populated rural Mississippi communities (Gainesville, Logtown, Napoleon, Santa Rosa, and Westonia), plus the northern portion of a sixth (Pearlington), along with 700 families in residence, had to be completely relocated away from the facility.\nSometimes the town might cease to officially exist, but the physical infrastructure remains. For example, the five Mississippi communities that had to be abandoned to build SSC still have remnants of those communities within the facility itself. These include city streets, now overgrown with forest flora and fauna, and a one-room schoolhouse. Another example of infrastructure remaining is the former town of Weston, Illinois, that voted itself out of existence and turned the land over for construction of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. Many houses and even a few barns remain, used for housing visiting scientists and storing maintenance equipment, while roads that used to cross through the site have been blocked off at the edges of the property, with gatehouses or barricades to prevent unsupervised access.\nFlooding by dams.\nConstruction of dams has produced ghost towns that have been left underwater. Examples include:\nArmed conflicts.\nSome towns become deserted when their populations were massacred, deported, or expelled. Examples include Kayak\u00f6y, an ancient Greek city abandoned in 1923 as result of population exchange between Greece and Turkey and the original French village at Oradour-sur-Glane which was destroyed on 10 June 1944 when 642 of its 663 inhabitants were killed by a German Waffen-SS company. A new village was built after the war on a nearby site, and the ruins of the original have been maintained as a memorial.\nAnother example is Aghdam, a city in Azerbaijan. Armenian forces occupied Aghdam in July 1993 during the First Nagorno-Karabakh War. The heavy fighting forced the entire population to flee. Upon seizing the city, Armenian forces destroyed much of the town to discourage Azerbaijanis from returning. More damage occurred in the following decades when locals looted the abandoned town for building materials. It is currently almost entirely ruined and uninhabited.\nDisasters, actual and anticipated.\nNatural and human-made disasters can create ghost towns. For example, after being flooded more than 30 times since their town was founded in 1845, residents of Pattonsburg, Missouri, decided to relocate after two floods in 1993. With government help, the whole town was rebuilt away.\nCraco, a medieval village in the Italian region of Basilicata, was evacuated after a landslide in 1963. Nowadays it is a filming location for many movies, including \"The Passion of The Christ\" by Mel Gibson, \"Christ Stopped at Eboli\" by Francesco Rosi, \"The Nativity Story\" by Catherine Hardwicke and \"Quantum of Solace\" by Marc Forster.\nIn 1984, Centralia, Pennsylvania, was abandoned due to an uncontainable mine fire, which began in 1962 and still rages to this day; eventually the fire reached an abandoned mine underneath the nearby town of Byrnesville, which caused that mine to catch on fire too and forced the evacuation of that town as well.\nGhost towns may also occasionally come into being due to an \"anticipated\" natural disaster \u2013 for example, the Canadian town of Lemieux, Ontario, was abandoned in 1991 after soil testing revealed that the community was built on an unstable bed of Leda clay. Two years after the last building in Lemieux was demolished, a landslide swept part of the former town-site into the South Nation River. Two decades earlier, the Canadian town of Saint-Jean-Vianney, Qu\u00e9bec, also constructed on a Leda clay base, had been abandoned after a landslide on 4 May 1971, which swept away 41 homes, killing 31 people.\nFollowing the Chernobyl disaster of 1986, dangerously high levels of nuclear contamination escaped into the surrounding area, and nearly 200 towns and villages in Ukraine and neighbouring Belarus were evacuated, including the cities of Pripyat and Chernobyl. The area was so contaminated that many of the evacuees were never permitted to return to their homes. Pripyat is the most famous of these abandoned towns; it was built for the workers of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant and had a population of almost 50,000 at the time of the disaster.\nHuman health.\nSignificant fatality rates from epidemics have produced ghost towns. Multiple hamlets in England were depopulated in the wake of the Black Plague in the mid-14th century. Some places in eastern Arkansas were abandoned after more than 7,000 Arkansans died during the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918 and 1919. Several communities in Ireland, particularly in the west of the country, were wiped out due to the Great Famine in the latter half of the 19th century, and the years of economic decline that followed.\nCatastrophic environmental damage caused by long-term contamination can also create a ghost town. Some notable examples are Times Beach, Missouri, whose residents were exposed to a high level of dioxins, and Wittenoom, Western Australia, which was once Australia's largest source of blue asbestos, but was shut down in 1966 due to health concerns. Treece and Picher, twin communities straddling the Kansas\u2013Oklahoma border, were once one of the United States' largest sources of zinc and lead, but over a century of unregulated disposal of mine tailings led to groundwater contamination and lead poisoning in the town's children, eventually resulting in a mandatory Environmental Protection Agency buyout and evacuation. Contamination due to ammunition caused by military use may also lead to the development of ghost towns. Tyneham, in Dorset, was requisitioned for military exercises during the Second World War, and remains unpopulated, being littered with unexploded munitions from regular shelling.\nGhost town repopulation.\nA few ghost towns have managed to get a second life, and this happens through a variety of reasons.\nOne of these reasons is heritage tourism generating a new economy able to support residents.\nFor example, Walhalla, Victoria, Australia, became almost deserted after its gold mine ceased operation in 1914, but owing to its accessibility and proximity to other attractive locations, it has had a recent economic and holiday population surge. Another town, Sungai Lembing, Malaysia, was almost deserted due to closure of a tin mine in 1986 was revived in 2001 and has become a tourist destination since then.\nFoncebad\u00f3n, a village in Le\u00f3n, Spain, that was mostly abandoned and only inhabited by a mother and son, is slowly being revived owing to the ever-increasing stream of pilgrims on the road to Santiago de Compostela.\nSome ghost towns (e.g. Riace, Mu\u00f1otello) are being repopulated by respectively refugees and homeless people. In Riace, this was accomplished by a scheme funded by the Italian government which offers the housing to refugees and in Mu\u00f1otello it was accomplished through an NGO (Madrina Foundation).\nIn Algeria, many cities became hamlets after the end of Late Antiquity. They were revived with shifts in population during and after French colonization of Algeria. Oran, currently the nation's second-largest city with 1 million people, was a village of only a few thousand people before colonization.\nAlexandria, the second-largest city of Egypt, was a flourishing city in the ancient era, but declined during the Middle Ages. It underwent a dramatic revival during the 19th century; from a population of 5,000 in 1806, it grew into a city of more than 200,000 inhabitants by 1882, and is now home to more than four million people.\nAround the world.\nAfrica.\nWars and rebellions in some African countries have left many towns and villages deserted. Since 2003, when President Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9 came to power, thousands of citizens of the Central African Republic have been forced to flee their homes as a result of the escalating conflict between armed rebels and government troops. Villages accused of supporting the rebels, such as Beogombo Deux near Paoua, are ransacked by government soldiers. Those who are not killed have no choice but to escape to refugee camps. The instability in the region also leaves organized and well-equipped bandits free to terrorize the populace, often leaving villages abandoned in their wake. Elsewhere in Africa, the town of Lukangol was burnt to the ground during tribal clashes in South Sudan. Before its destruction, the town had a population of 20,000. The Libyan town of Tawergha had a population of around 25,000 before it was abandoned during the 2011 civil war, and it has remained empty since.\nMany of the ghost towns in mineral-rich Africa are former mining towns. Shortly after the start of the 1908 diamond rush in German South-West Africa, now known as Namibia, the German Imperial government claimed sole mining rights by creating the (\"forbidden zone\"), effectively criminalizing new settlement. The small mining towns of this area, among them Pomona, Elizabeth Bay and Kolmanskop, were exempt from this ban, but the denial of new land claims soon rendered all of them ghost towns.\nAsia.\nThe town of Dhanushkodi, India is a ghost town. It was destroyed during the 1964 Rameswaram cyclone and remains uninhabited in the aftermath.\nMany abandoned towns and settlements in the former Soviet Union were established near Gulag labour camps to supply necessary services. Since most of these camps were abandoned in the 1950s, the towns were abandoned as well. One such town is located near the former Gulag camp called Butugychag (also called Lower Butugychag). Other towns were deserted due to deindustrialisation and the economic crises of the early 1990s attributed to post-Soviet conflicts \u2013 one example being Tkvarcheli in Georgia, a coal mining town that suffered a drastic population decline as a result of the War in Abkhazia in the early 1990s and Aghdam, made ruined and uninhabited after the First Nagorno-Karabakh War.\nAlthough in the 2010s Chinese ghost cities became a frequent feature of discourse regarding China's economy and urbanization, underoccupied cities filled up.151 Writing in 2023, academic and former UK diplomat Kerry Brown described the idea of Chinese ghost cities as a popular bandwagon which was shown to be a myth.151\u2013152\nThe town of Namie, along with several other towns in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan, was temporarily evacuated as a result of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster following the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. Following ongoing decontamination works, several portions of Namie have been fully reopened to residents, allowing reconstruction and renovation of the town's buildings to be undertaken and resettlement of the area to take place.\nEurope.\nUrbanization \u2013 the migration of a country's rural population into the cities \u2013 has left many European towns and villages deserted. An increasing number of settlements in Bulgaria are becoming ghost towns for this reason; at the time of the 2011 census, the country had 181 uninhabited settlements. In Hungary, dozens of villages are also threatened with abandonment. The first village officially declared as \"dead\" was Gy\u0171r\u0171f\u0171 in the late 1970s, but later it was repopulated as an eco-village. Some other depopulated villages were successfully saved as small rural resorts, such as K\u00e1n, Tornak\u00e1polna, Szanticska, Gorica, and R\u00e9vfalu.\nIn Spain, large zones of the mountainous Iberian System and the Pyrenees have undergone heavy depopulation since the early 20th century, leaving a string of ghost towns in areas such as the Solana Valley. Traditional agricultural practices such as sheep and goat rearing, on which the mountain village economy was based, were not taken over by the local youth, especially after the lifestyle changes that swept over rural Spain during the second half of the 20th century.\nExamples of ghost towns in Italy include the medieval village of Fabbriche di Careggine near Lago di Vagli, in province of Lucca, in Tuscany, the deserted mountain village of Craco, located in Basilicata, which has served as a filming location, and the ghost village of Roveraia, in the municipality of Loro Ciuffenna, in province of Arezzo, situated near Pratovalle. The presence of the village is attested since the Middle Ages, when there was a tower. During World War II it was an important partisan base and it was abandoned between the 1960s and the 1980s, when the last family who lived here left the village. Two projects have been proposed for the recovery of the village: in 2011 the proposal of Movimento Libero Perseo \"Roveraia eco - lab\", based on sustainability, and in 2019 there was a proposal aiming to recover the village with a mix of functions called \"Ecomuseum of Pratomagno\".\nIn the United Kingdom, thousands of villages were abandoned during the Middle Ages, as a result of Black Death, revolts, and enclosure, the process by which vast amounts of farmland became privately owned. Since there are rarely any visible remains of these settlements, they are not generally considered ghost towns; instead, they are referred to in archaeological circles as deserted medieval villages.\nSometimes, wars and genocide end a town's life. In 1944, occupying German \"Waffen-SS\" troops murdered almost the entire population of the French village Oradour-sur-Glane. A new settlement was built nearby after the war, but the old town was left depopulated on the orders of President Charles de Gaulle, as a permanent memorial. In Germany, numerous smaller towns and villages in the former eastern territories were completely destroyed in the last two years of the war. These territories later became part of Poland and the Soviet Union, and many of the smaller settlements were never rebuilt or repopulated, for example K\u0142omino (\"Westfalenhof\"), Pstr\u0105\u017ce (\"Pstransse\"), and Janowa G\u00f3ra (\"Johannesberg\"). Some villages in England were also abandoned during the war, but for different reasons. Imber, on Salisbury Plain, and several villages in the Stanford Battle Area, were commandeered by the War Office for use as training grounds for British and US troops. Although this was intended to be a temporary measure, the residents were never allowed to return, and the villages have been used for military training ever since. southeast of Imber is Copehill Down, a deserted village purpose-built for training in urban warfare.\nDisasters &amp; natural disasters have played a part in the abandonment of settlements within Europe. Two examples are Pripyat and Chernobyl. After the Chernobyl disaster of 1986, both cities were evacuated due to dangerous radiation levels within the area. As of today, Pripyat remains completely abandoned, and Chernobyl has around 500 remaining inhabitants. Another example is Todoque in the Canary Islands, Spain. During the 2021 Cumbre Vieja volcanic eruption, the locality was severely affected. Hundreds of buildings were destroyed, including the parish Church of Saint Pius X, the health center, the headquarters of the neighborhood association, the School of Early Childhood Education, and Los Campitos Elementary School and the Todoque Elementary and the Infant Education School, and by October 10, new lava flows destroyed the remaining buildings that were still standing, leaving the town practically erased from the map.\nAn example in the UK of a ghost village which was abandoned before it was ever occupied is at Polphail, Argyll and Bute. The planned development of an oil rig construction facility nearby never materialised, and a village built to house the workers and their families became deserted the moment the building contractors finished their work.\nNorth America.\nCanada.\nCanada has several ghost towns in parts of British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Quebec. Some were logging towns or dual mining and logging sites, often developed at the behest of the company. In Alberta and Saskatchewan, most ghost towns were once farming communities that have since died off due to the removal of the railway through the town or the bypass of a highway. The ghost towns in British Columbia were predominantly mining towns and prospecting camps as well as canneries and, in one or two cases, large smelter and pulp mill towns. British Columbia has more ghost towns than any other jurisdiction on the North American continent, with more than 1,500 abandoned or semi-abandoned towns and localities. Among the most notable are Anyox, Kitsault, and Ocean Falls.\nSome ghost towns have revived their economies and populations due to historical and eco-tourism, such as Barkerville; once the largest town north of Kamloops, it is now a year-round provincial museum. In Quebec, Val-Jalbert is a well-known tourist ghost town; founded in 1901 around a mechanical pulp mill that became obsolete when paper mills began to break down wood fibre by chemical means, it was abandoned when the mill closed in 1927 and re-opened as a park in 1960.\nMexico.\nA former mining town in Mexico, Real de Catorce, has been used as a backdrop for Hollywood movies such as \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\" (1948), \"The Mexican\" (2001), and \"Bandidas\" (2006).\nUnited States.\nMany ghost towns or abandoned communities exist in the American Great Plains, the rural areas of which have lost a third of their population since 1920. Thousands of communities in the northern plains states of Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota became railroad ghost towns when a rail line failed to materialize. Hundreds of towns were abandoned as the Interstate highway system replaced the railroads as the favored means of transportation. Ghost towns are common in mining or mill towns in all the western states, and many eastern and southern states as well. Residents are compelled to leave in search of more productive areas when the resources that had created an employment boom in these towns were eventually exhausted.\nSometimes a ghost town consists of many abandoned buildings as in Bodie, California, or standing ruins as in Rhyolite, Nevada, while elsewhere only the foundations of former buildings remain as in Graysonia, Arkansas. Old mining camps that have lost most of their population at some stage of their history such as Aspen, Deadwood, Oatman, Tombstone and Virginia City are sometimes referred to as ghost towns although they are presently active towns and cities. Many U.S. ghost towns, such as South Pass City in Wyoming are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nStarting in 2002, an attempt to declare an official ghost town in California stalled when the adherents of the town of Bodie and those of Calico, in Southern California, could not agree on the most deserving settlement for the recognition. A compromise was eventually reached\u2014Bodie became the official state gold rush ghost town, while Calico was named the official state silver rush ghost town.\nSouth America.\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a wave of European immigrants arrived in Brazil and settled in the cities, which offered jobs, education, and other opportunities that enabled newcomers to enter the middle class. Many also settled in the growing small towns along the expanding railway system. Since the 1930s, many rural workers have moved to the big cities. Other ghost towns were created in the aftermath of dinosaur fossil rushes.\nIn Colombia, a volcano erupted in 1985, where the city of Armero was engulfed by lahars, which killed approximately 23,000 people in total. Armero was never rebuilt (its inhabitants being diverted to nearby cities, and thus becoming a ghost town), but still stands today as \"holy land\", as dictated by Pope John Paul II.\nA number of ghost towns throughout South America were once mining camps or lumber mills, such as the many saltpeter mining camps that prospered in Chile from the end of the Saltpeter War until the invention of synthetic saltpeter during World War I. Some of these towns, such as the Humberstone and Santa Laura Saltpeter Works in the Atacama Desert, have been declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\nOceania.\nThe boom and bust of gold rushes and the mining of other ores has led to a number of ghost towns in both Australia and New Zealand. Other towns have become abandoned whether due to natural disasters, the weather, or the drowning of valleys to increase the size of lakes.\nIn Australia, the Victoria gold rush led to numerous ghost towns (such as Cassilis and Moliagul), as did the hunt for gold in Western Australia (for example, the towns of Ora Banda and Kanowna). The mining of iron and other ores has also led to towns thriving briefly before dwindling. The town of Wittenoom was abandoned and demolished due to the health hazards posed by asbestos mining in the area.\nIn New Zealand, the Otago gold rush similarly led to several ghost towns (such as Macetown). New Zealand's ghost towns also include numerous coal mining areas in the South Island's West Coast Region, including Denniston and Stockton. Natural disasters have also led to the loss of some towns, notably Te Wairoa, \"The Buried Village\", destroyed in the 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera, and the Otago town of Kelso, abandoned after it was flooded repeatedly after heavy rainstorms. Early settlements on the rugged southwest coast of the South Island at Martins Bay and Port Craig were also abandoned, mainly due to the inhospitable terrain.\nAntarctica.\nThe oldest ghost town in Antarctica is on Deception Island, where in 1906, a Norwegian-Chilean company set up a whaling station at Whalers Bay, which they used as a base for their factory ship, the \"Gobernador Bories\". Other whaling operations followed suit, and by 1914 there were thirteen factory ships based there. The station ceased to be profitable during the Great Depression, and was abandoned in 1931. In 1969, the station was partially destroyed by a volcanic eruption. There are also many abandoned scientific and military bases in Antarctica, especially in the Antarctic Peninsula.\nThe Antarctic island of South Georgia used to have several thriving whaling settlements during the first half of the 20th century, with a combined population exceeding 2,000 in some years. These included Grytviken (operating 1904\u201364), Leith Harbour (1909\u201365), Ocean Harbour (1909\u201320), Husvik (1910\u201360), Stromness (1912\u201361) and Prince Olav Harbour (1917\u201334). The abandoned settlements have become increasingly dilapidated and remain uninhabited nowadays except for the Museum curator's family at Grytviken. The jetty, the church, dwellings, and industrial buildings at Grytviken have recently been renovated by the South Georgian government, becoming a popular tourist destination. Some historical buildings in the other settlements are being restored as well.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "43573", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43573", "title": "Lager Beer Riot", "text": "Series of riots in Chicago in 1855\nThe Lager Beer Riot occurred on April 21, 1855 in Chicago, Illinois, and was the first major civil disturbance in the city. Mayor Levi Boone, a Nativist politician, renewed enforcement of an old local ordinance mandating that taverns be closed on Sundays and led the city council to raise the cost of a liquor license from $50 per year to $300 per year, renewable quarterly. The move was seen as targeting German immigrants in particular and so caused a greater sense of community within the group.\nBackground.\nChicago's rapid growth in the 1840s and 1850s was largely because of German and Irish Catholic immigrants. Chicago was developing into an attractive opportunity for many immigrants. Although the jobs that awaited the immigrant were often poor-paying wage based positions, opportunities were often more promising than that of their home country. The immigrants settled in their own neighborhoods, German immigrants congregating mainly on the North Side, across the Chicago River from City Hall and the older Protestant part of the city. The German settlers worked a six-day week, leaving Sunday as their primary day to socialize; much socialization took place in the small taverns that dotted the North Side of Chicago. German-language newspapers, such as the Illinois Staats-Zeitung and social movements like the Turners and German craft unions gave the German population of Chicago a high degree of social and political cohesiveness. Additionally, the Forty-Eighters among them had previously used demonstrations as a political tool during the European revolutions of 1848.\nAs in much of the rest of the country, nativist distrust of Catholic influence produced a backlash in the form of the \"Know-Nothing\" movement. In the election of 1854, the Temperance Party candidate, Amos Throop, lost by a margin of nearly 20% to Isaac Lawrence Milliken. Nevertheless, after winning the election, Milliken declared himself in favor of temperance as well. Milliken lost the following year to Levi Boone, the American Party candidate. Levi Boone ran on an anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic platform of the Know-Nothing Party, which garnered him enough support to win the election. The Know-Nothing Party nationally had been feeding off the swell of nationalist sentiments brewing in the nation in the 1840s and 1850s. In his inauguration speech, Mayor Boone stated, \"I cannot be blind to the existence in our midst of a powerful politico-religious organization, all its members owing, and its chief officers bound under an oath of allegiance to the temporal, as well as the spiritual supremacy of a foreign despot.\" Associated with his fear of foreigners, Boone, a Baptist and temperance advocate, believed that the Sabbath was profaned by having drinking establishments open on Sunday. However, the temperance movement was seen in the eyes of immigrants as a means of control used by the elites to further control the working class. Although Boone's actions were in anticipation of Illinois enacting a Maine law by referendum that would prohibit the sale of alcohol for recreational purposes, the referendum failed in June 1855, by a statewide vote of 54% to 46%. The following year, after Boone was turned out of office, the prohibition was repealed.\nBefore 1853, Chicago had only \"a small force of armed municipal officers.\" The Cook County sheriff's office was largely responsible for policing the city, whose constable system \"was modeled on the colonial and English systems.\" Lacking any distinction of their own, elected town constables and night watchmen contributed to the protection of the city. In response to the inadequacy of the constable system, a police department separate and distinct from municipal courts was established in 1853. All eighty men who comprised the newly formed Chicago Police department were native born.\nEvents.\nDespite the renewed enforcement of Chicago's liquor ordinance, tavern owners continued to sell beer on Sundays. That resulted in over 200 Germans being arrested in violation of both the license and the Sunday ordinances. The numerous arrests led to the scheduling of a test case for the 21st of April. Saloon keepers \"decided to unite for defense and resistance, [and] contributed toward a common fund and counsel to represent all.\"\nRobin Einhorn argues that the scheduling of such an event, \"in effect, scheduled the riot.\" Protesters clashed with police near the Cook County Court House. Waves of angry immigrants stormed the downtown area. \"As the marchers, coming from the north with fife and drum, approached the Chicago River at Clark Street,\" the mayor ordered the swing bridges opened to stop further waves of protestors from crossing the river. This left some trapped on the bridges, police then fired shots at protesters stuck on the Clark Street Bridge over the Chicago River. A policeman named George W. Hunt was shot in the arm by a rioter named Peter Martin. Martin was then killed by police, and Hunt's arm had to be amputated. Rumors flew throughout the city that more protesters were killed. There is no evidence to support that, but loaded cannons set on the public square contributed to those rumors.\nOutcomes.\nThe Lager Beer Riot lead to a compromise in which the city council lowered the liquor license fee from $300 to $100. The council decided not to release those already imprisoned for not paying the $300 fee, but most of those arrested during the riot were released and not charged.\nThe Lager Beer Riot illustrated the risk German immigrants were willing to bear to protect German saloon owners who they perceived as leaders of their community. The mayor's temperance policy thus united German property owners, who could have been a natural ally of the mayor because of their strong interest in order, with working-class German immigrants.\nIn addition to the economic implications of the riot, there were compelling socio-cultural reasons for German immigrants to protest the newly instated ordinance. Mitrani posits that, \"To the German and Irish immigrants, drinking beer on Sundays was an orderly and habitual way to spend their one day off... Yet on a deeper level, this clash over drinking marked the opening salvo in a struggle over how the new class of wage workers would spend their time.\" The riot over beer represents a larger issue of a nativist approach to control the immigrant working class. Drinking, particularly on Sundays, was considered unacceptable. Closing taverns on Sundays and raising the cost of liquor licenses was a way to enforce what was considered acceptable behavior.\nWhile the new policies were an attempt to control the immigrant class, the events of the riot proved to be a call for a new type of order. Within a week of the riot, a committee was formed and worked with the city government to pass a series of reforms that ultimately resulted in the reorganization of the Chicago Police Department.\nThe lasting effects of such a traumatic event would influence Chicago for decades to come. Tensions continued to increase between those who advocated temperance and those who enjoyed the pastime. According to Sam Mitrani, \"the bulk of those arrested [had] working-class occupations...[and] the only arrestees who were not part of or tied to [Chicago's] growing working class were four ministers, eight doctors, and four lawyers.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "43577", "revid": "15244483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43577", "title": "Carmelites", "text": "Catholic religious order\nThe Order of the Brothers of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel (; abbreviated OCarm), known as the Carmelites or sometimes by synecdoche known simply as Carmel, is a mendicant order in the Catholic Church for both men and women. Historical records about its origin remain uncertain; it was probably founded in the 12th century on Mount Carmel in the Holy Land.\nNames.\nThe Order of the Brothers of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel are also known simply as the Carmelites or the Carmelite Order. To differentiate themselves from the Discalced Carmelites (founded in 1562), who grew out of the older order but today have more members, the original Carmelites are sometimes known as the Carmelites of the Ancient Observance and very rarely the Calced Carmelites (discalced being a reference to some religious orders going barefoot or wearing sandals instead of shoes).\nHistory.\nHistorical records about its origin remain uncertain, but the order was probably founded in the 12th century on Mount Carmel in the Crusader States. Berthold of Calabria, as well as Albert of Vercelli, have traditionally been associated with the founding of the order, but few clear records of early Carmelite history have survived. The order of Carmelite nuns was formalised in 1452.\nSpiritual origin.\nThe Carmelite Order is one of the few monastic orders, if not the only one, not to refer to a charismatic founder, but to a prophet of the Old Testament: Elijah and his disciple Elisha are considered by the Carmelites as the spiritual fathers of the order. Tradition indicates the presence on Mount Carmel of a series of Jewish and then Christian hermits who lived, prayed and taught in the caves used by Elijah and Elisha. This is how the first Christian hermits (at the origin of the founding of the order) settled in the caves of Mount Carmel to pray to God. The first chapel built within the hermitages and bringing together this community is dedicated to the Virgin Mary. Very quickly, the spirituality of the order turned to Mary who became the queen and mistress of Carmel.\nHermit and monastic life on Mount Carmel.\nBefore the presence of the Carmelites, in the 6th century Byzantine monks built a monastery dedicated to Saint Elijah in a valley a few kilometers south of the present monastery. This was destroyed in 614 by the Persians of Khosrow II. Around 1150, a Greek monk from Calabria established a community of about ten members among the ruins of the ancient Byzantine monastery which he rebuilt and renamed Saint Elijah.\nFoundation of the Order on Mount Carmel.\nTradition indicates that the order was founded in 1185, but that is based on the story of a pilgrim in the Holy Land, the interpretation of which remains questionable. The oldest (and most reliable) written accounts of the presence of Latin hermits on Mount Carmel date back to 1220 and another text from 1263 (See ). During the Third Crusade, a group of hermits led by Berthold of Calabria began to inhabit the caves of Mount Carmel following the prophet Elijah. This first monastery was located in the east\u2013west facing valley located south of the current monastery, and east of the \"Haifa Sde Yehoshua Cemetery\".\nAt the beginning of the 13th century, their leader was supposed to be Brocard, although written evidence is lacking. In the Carmelite rule, reference is made only to \"Brother B.\" (in the introductory sentence of the rule) who asked the patriarch for a rule of life for hermits. Tradition has established that it was Brocard, second prior general of the order, who asked the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, Albert of Vercelli, to provide the group of hermits with a written rule of life. This rule, dated 1209, is centered on prayer and defined the way of life of hermits.\nThe first act of the Order of Brothers of The Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel was to dedicate a chapel to the Virgin Mary under the title of Mary, Star of the Sea (in Latin: \"Stella Maris\"). Elisabeth Steinmann considers it probable that the hermits of Mount Carmel also settled in some cities of Palestine (Acre, Israel, Tyre, Tripoli, Beaulieu in Lebanon), but after a few decades, these hermits began to leave the Holy Land as a result of the insecurity linked to the Muslim reconquests which marked the end of the Crusades. They then returned to Europe where they spread this new monastic order.\nThe rule of St. Albert was not approved by a pope until 30 January 1226 in the bull \"Ut vivendi normam\" of Honorius III. In 1229 Pope Gregory IX confirmed this rule again and gave it the status of \"Regula bullata\".\nAt the end of the first crusade led by Louis IX of France in the Holy Land in 1254 (the Seventh Crusade), Louis brought six Carmelites back to France who joined with those who since 1238 had started to seek and found houses all over Europe. The fall of Saint-Jean-d'Acre in 1291, and the fall of the Latin state of Outremer led to the destruction of the last Carmelite convents in the Holy Land. The Carmelites who had chosen to remain there were massacred by the Mamelukes.\nJerg Ratgeb painted a fresco retracing the life of the Carmelites at the beginning of the 16th century, on the walls of the refectory of the Carmelite monastery in Frankfurt.\nFrom hermits to friars.\nBack in Europe, the hermits of Carmel encountered many difficulties. Their eremitic life did not adapt well to their new settlements, they were scattered in different nations, and they found themselves in \"competition\" with other mendicant orders. Pope Innocent III wished to bring the mendicant orders all together under the direction of the Order of Friars Minor and the Order of Preachers. In 1215, the Fourth Lateran Council decided to group the existing Mendicant orders under the two primary ones. In 1274 the Second Council of Lyon disestablished all mendicant orders that were founded after 1215; only four remained: the Franciscans, the Order of Preachers, the Carmelites, and the Augustinians. The Carmelites, barely spared, had to change their way of life from eremitic to mendicant.\nGradually, during the 13th century, Carmelite hermits returning from Mount Carmel resettled throughout Europe, e.g. in Cyprus, Sicily, Italy, England, and southern France. Some dates and locations are known:\nHowever, the new settlements of the Carmelites in the European cities were very different from their eremitical life on Mount Carmel. In addition, they faced hostility from the secular clergy and even from other mendicant orders, who saw them as competitors.\nAccording to tradition, the prior general of the Carmelites, Simon Stock, worried about the very difficult situation of the order, which was still threatened with dissolution by the Catholic Church, intensely prayed to the Blessed Virgin Mary to aid the order. In 1251, Our Lady of Mount Carmel appeared to him accompanied by a multitude of angels and holding in her hand the Scapular of the Order. In his vision, Mary said &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Receive, my dear son, this scapular of your Order, as the distinctive sign of the mark of the privilege that I have obtained for you and the children of Carmel; it is a sign of salvation, a safeguard in perils and the pledge of peace and special protection until the end of the centuries. Whoever dies in this garment will be preserved from eternal fires.\nFollowing this vision, and the spread of the Scapular, the Order of Carmel endured and spread rapidly. The historicity of these events is disputed because of the lack of contemporary written records for the period in question; the earliest extant written records are from approximately 150 years later), and some documents contradict this narrative.\nIn the bull \"Paganorum incursus\" of 27 July 1247, Pope Innocent IV officially denominated the order the \"Brothers of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel\" and asked bishops to kindly accept them in their dioceses. However, the hostility of the secular clergy to the Carmelites was such that it prompted repetition of this recommendation on 4 October later that year.\nIn 1247, the Carmelites asked Pope Innocent IV to modify the \"Rule of Saint Albert\" of 1209 to adapt it to their new way of life in cities. In this modification, the communal dimension of their life was clearly emphasized. Pope Innocent IV clarified and corrected some ambiguities and mitigated some severities of the original Rule, and on 1 October 1247 he established the text in the bull \"Quae honorem conditoris omnium\". Thereafter, e.g., the Carmelites no longer ate meals in their cells separately and instead ate in common in a refectory. Thereafter Carmelites also preached and heard confessions in secular (ordinary) churches.\nThe last great uncertainty for the survival of the order occurred in 1274. During the \"sanota vacillationis\" session of 17 July 1274, the Second Council of Lyon, presided by Pope Gregory X, suppressed all the mendicant orders that lacked regular legal status (\"incert mendicita\"). The Carmelites defended the anteriority of their foundation, i.e. their institution before 1215, and the pertinent decisions of the Fourth Lateran Council, and emphasized their pontifical approvals. After many Carmelite interventions during this session, the Pope confirmed their anteriority.\nAfter the General Chapter of the Order of 1287 in Montpellier, France, the Carmelites replaced the white and brown striped, or barred, coat of their habit with a white cloak, because of which cloak they therefore colloquially were denominated \"White Friars\".\nThe assimilation of the Carmelites as a mendicant order in 1326 by Pope John XXII ended the final hindrances, and the Carmelites could then rightly perform their apostolic mission. Nonetheless, a conflict ensued between the Carmelites who desired an eremitic life and those who desired an apostolic life in cities, including preaching. Consequently, two kinds of Carmelite monastery developed, one in the heart of cities and another outside them. Carmelites began to study theology at universities.\nMitigation of the rule.\nThe mitigation of the Rule came after the great epidemic of the Black Death in the middle of the 14th century, which brought about a collapse of the European population accompanied by a decrease of members of monastic orders.\nDuring the chapter of Nantes, a majority of Carmelites asked to appeal to Pope Eugene IV for a second mitigation of the Rule of 1209 of Saint Albert; the reform of 1247 was considered the first mitigation.\nThe letter, dated 15 February 1432, indicated that &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Many professed members of the Order can no longer observe the rule because of its severity and rigor, both because of the fragility human than by weakness of the body.\nTwo Carmelites were sent to convey this request to the Pope. The Pope responded in 1435 with the bull \"Romani Pontificis\", dated 15 February 1432, the date of the petition. Addressed to the Prior General, Jean Faci, the bull granted the Carmelites permission to freely and lawfully stay and walk \"in their churches, and in the cloisters of these and in the places adjoining them at the appropriate times\", moreover, it granted the faculty to eat meat three days a week, except during Advent and Lent and on other days when this was prohibited by general law.\nPope Pius II completed this permission on 5 December 1469 by granting the Prior General the faculty of dispensing from fasting on days when abstinence was lifted.\nPope Sixtus IV granted greater freedom, commonly known as \"Mare magnum\", in the bull \"Dum attendant meditatatione\" of 28 November 1476, which conceded many advantages to the mendicant orders. However, this mitigation of the Rule was somewhat resisted. Even before its promulgation, there was some protest against \"a general relaxation\" of the Rule.\nAttempts of reforms.\nThe advantages of the new rule were sometimes frowned upon in certain monasteries which wished to return to the old rule of 1247. The convents of La Selve (near Florence), Mantua and G\u00e9ronde (Switzerland) thrived because of their tendency to observe the ancient observant rule. The Carmelites of Mantua obtained from Pope Eugene IV the bull \"Fama laudabilis\", in 1442, which allowed them to be a separate congregation, governed by a vicar general and only distantly subject to the prior general. While influential during the 15th century, the \"Reform of Mantua\" subsequently became of marginal influence. Finally, this mitigation introduced around 1465 was definitively incorporated into the regulation of the Order of the Great Carmelites in 1783 by Pope Pius VI.\nJohn Soreth, a friar from the Carmelite Convent of Caen, who served as Prior General in the years 1451\u20131471, tried to convince his subjects to lead a more rigorous religious life by developing seeds already sown and promoting movements that already existed. His motto was \"Return to the Rule of Saint Albert\". In his early decrees he protested against privileges and exemptions, seen as a major cause of the decline of the order.\nThe constitutions of the order dating from 1362 were revised and the text approved by the general chapter of Brussels in 1462. They insisted on &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The divine office, the vow of poverty, silence and solitude, the custody of the convent and the cell, studies, work and the visits of the superiors. The reform took hold in some of the convents, the \"observant convents\", and the \"mixed convents\". John Soreth hoped that his reform would gradually be imposed in all the houses of the order, but this attempt at reform remained largely unfulfilled since the prior general who followed him favored a return to a mitigation of the rule, and met with the approval of Popes Pius II and Sixtus IV.\nIn 1523 Pope Hadrian VI appointed Nicolas Audet as vicar general. The latter organized a centralization of the government of the different provinces while ensuring the training of the religious.\nIn 1499, the Reform of Albi aimed at a return to a more strict observance and in 1513 was approved as a \"Congregation of Observance\". However, this reform was suppressed in 1584 by Pope Gregory XIII\nIn 1603, Henri Sylvius, Prior General of the Order, went to France at the request of the king Henri IV of France, to undertake with Philippe Thibault the reform of the province of Touraine. Pierre Behourt, Louis Charpentier, Philippe Thibault and Jean de Saint-Samson were to be the initiators and architects of this reform of the Carmelites of the Old observance. Figures of note in the Catholic Reformation, they were supported by Charles Borromeo, cardinal and archbishop of Milan. On 20 June 1604, at the provincial chapter of Nantes, Henri Sylvius published the statutes of the reform, which intended to promote the interior life and return to the ancient tradition of the order, under the patronage of the Virgin Mary and Saint Joseph.\nBy the middle of the 17th century, most of the French provinces had adopted the reform, which had already won over the convents of Belgium (1624) and Germany. Its constitutions were definitively affirmed in 1635.\nIn 1645, during the general chapter held in Rome, the provincial of Touraine, L\u00e9on de Saint-Jean, was appointed a member of a committee to further revise these constitutions with a view to having them adopted by all the reformed convents of the order.\nFoundation of Carmelite Nuns.\nFrom the Middle Ages, women close to the communities of Carmelite friars were drawn to their life of prayer. Thus, in the Low Countries some beguinages adopted the Carmelite rule and thus formed communities in the second half of the 15th century. Prior General John Soreth worked to transform these beguinages into Carmelite women's convents.\nOn 7 October 1452, Pope Nicholas V promulgated the bull \"Cum Nulla\" introducing the Carmelites in France. Under his protection, Fran\u00e7oise d'Amboise (\u20201485), Duchess of Brittany, erected the first convent for Carmelite nuns in France. In 1463, a house was built in Vannes to accommodate a first community and on 2 November 1463 nine nuns arrived there from Li\u00e8ge and settled permanently. While the Vannes convent, such as \"Les Trois Maries\", was to suffer suppression in 1792, during the French Revolution, in the meantime convents of Carmelite nuns had spread rapidly, including many in Spain and Italy.\nFoundation of the Third Order.\nJohn Soreth played an extremely important role in the founding of the Third Order of the Carmelites. Pope Nicholas V supported this action in his bull \"Cum Nulla\", too.\nIn France, there were many Carmelite fraternities of the Third Order before the Revolution. Many died during the French Revolution, but a few evolved and organized themselves into a religious congregation of apostolic life.\nCurrently the Third Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel has a large number of fraternities in many countries. Following the return of the Carmelites of the Old observance to France in 1989, at the request of the laity, fraternities began to be formed. The first fraternity was established in the diocese of Toulon in 1992. A second was in Nantes in 2001.\nTeresian reform.\nReform in Spain began in earnest in the 1560s, with the work of Teresa of \u00c1vila, who, together with John of the Cross, established the Discalced Carmelites. Teresa's foundations were welcomed by King Philip II of Spain, who was most anxious for all orders to be reformed according to the principles of the Council of Trent (1545\u20131563). But she created practical problems at the grassroots level. The proliferation of new religious houses in towns that were already struggling to cope economically was an unwelcome prospect. Local townspeople resisted direction by the nobility and diocesan clergy. Teresa tried to make her monasteries as self-sufficient as was practicable, and accordingly restricted the number of nuns in each community.\nThe Discalced Carmelites also faced much opposition from unreformed Carmelite houses, as when Carmelites from Toledo arrested and imprisoned John of the Cross in their monastery. Only in the 1580s did the Discalced Carmelites gain official approval of their status. In 1593, the Discalced Carmelites had their own superior general styled praepositus general, the first such being Nicholas Doria. Due to the politics of foundation, the Discalced friars in Italy were canonically erected as a separate juridical entity.\nAfter the rise of Protestantism and the devastation of the French Wars of Religion, a spirit of reform renewed 16th\u201317th century France, as well as the Carmelite Order in France. In the late 16th century, Pierre Behourt began an effort to restore the state of the Province of Touraine, which was continued by the practical reforms of Philip Thibault. The Provincial Chapter of 1604 appointed Thibault the prior of the Convent in Rennes, and moved the Novitiate to Rennes, thereby ensuring that new members of the Province would be formed by the reform-minded friars. The Observance of Rennes advocated poverty, the interior life and regular observance as the antidote to the laxity and decadence into which religious life had fallen, in addition, incorporating currents of renewal from the Discalced Reform, the French School, and the Society of Jesus. Thibault is said to have wished to marry the spirit of the society with the Order of Carmelites as far as possible. One of the most renowned figures of the Reform was John of St. Samson, a blind lay brother, highly regarded for his humility and exalted spiritual life. In 1612, Br. John was moved to the Convent at Rennes and, in addition to playing the organ, served as the instructor and spiritual director of the novices. Thus John of St. Samson became known as the \"Soul of the Reform.\" Eventually, the Observance of Rennes spread to priories throughout France, Belgium, and Germany, and became known as the Touraine Reform, after the Province from which the movement originated.\nCarmelite nunneries were established in New Spain (Mexico), the first founded in 1604 in Puebla de los Angeles, New Spain's second largest city, followed by one in the capital Mexico City 1616. In all, before Mexican independence in 1821, there were five Carmelite convents among 56 nunneries.\nPapebroch controversy.\nDaniel Papebroch was a member of the Bollandists, a group of Jesuit hagiographers who produced the \"Acta Sanctorum\", which took an analytical approach to the \"Lives of the Saints\". In his preliminary commentary on Albert of Vercelli, who is credited with the Carmelite Rule, Papebroch said that the tradition universally received by the Carmelites, that the origin of the order dated back to the prophet Elias, as its founder, was insufficiently grounded. The Carmelites took exception to this.\nFrom 1681 to 1693 there appeared between twenty or thirty pamphlets castigating Papebroch and his work. The series culminated in the large quarto volume signed by Sebastian of St. Paul, provincial of the Flemish-Belgian province of the Carmelite Order, which made serious charges against Papebroch's orthodoxy. Learning that steps were being taken to obtain a condemnation from Rome of the \"Acta Sanctorum\", the Bollandists responded. Conrad Janninck replied first with open letters to Sebastian of St. Paul. The two letters were printed in 1693, followed by a more extended defense of the \"Acta\", published by Janninck in 1695. Papebroch published his rebuttal in 1696, 1697, and 1698 in the three volumes of the \"Responsio Danielis Papebrochii ad Exhibitionem Errorum\".\nWhen Rome did not issue a condemnation the adversaries of Papebroch had recourse to the tribunal of the Spanish Inquisition, which in November, 1695, issued a decree condemning the fourteen volumes of the \"Acta Sanctorum\" published up to that time and branding it heretical. Janninck was sent to Rome not only to prevent the confirmation by Rome of the decree of the Spanish Inquisition, but also to secure the retraction of the decree. In December, 1697, he received the assurance that no censure would be passed against the volumes condemned in Spain. On 20 November 1698, Pope Innocent XII issued a brief that ended the controversy by imposing silence on both parties. Whether it was judged prudent in Rome not to enter into conflict with the Spanish tribunal, or whether the latter prolonged the affair by passive resistance, the decree of condemnation made in 1695 was not revoked until 1715, the year following the death of Papebroch.\nModern history.\nLeaders of the Carmelite Order meet from time to time in General Congregation. The most recent General Congregation took place in F\u00e1tima, Portugal in September 2016.\nSince the 1430s, the Congregation of Mantua had continued to function in its little corner of Italy. It was only at the end of the 19th century that those following the reform of Tourraine (by this time known as the \"strict observance\") and the Mantuan Congregation were formally merged under one set of constitutions. The friars following Mantua conceded to Tourraine's Constitutions but insisted that the older form of the habit \u2013 namely their own \u2013 should be adopted. In a photograph of the period Titus Brandsma is shown in the habit of Tourraine as a novice; in all subsequent images he wears that of the newly styled ancient observance.\nThe French Revolution led to the suppression of the order, with the nuns dispersed into small groups who lived out of view in private houses. At the peak of the persecution, a Carmelite convent, now known as the Martyrs of Compi\u00e8gne, were executed by guillotine.\nAfter the end of the disturbances, the wealthy heiress Camille de Soy\u00e9court who became later the Carmelite Th\u00e9r\u00e8se-Camille de l'Enfant-J\u00e9sus did much to restore the Carmelite life in France.\nThe Napoleonic secularisation at the beginning of the 19th century in Germany was a strong blow to the Carmelites. After Napoleon had occupied large parts of the Rhineland, almost all monasteries were dissolved after 1806; the 16 houses of the Lower German Province disappeared.\nBy the last decades of the 19th century, there were approximately 200 Carmelite men throughout the world. At the beginning of the 20th century, however, new leadership and less political interference allowed a rebirth of the order. Existing provinces began re-founding provinces that had become defunct. The theological preparation of the Carmelites was strengthened, particularly with the foundation of St. Albert's College in Rome.\nBy 2001, the membership had increased to approximately 2,100 men in 25 provinces, 700 enclosed nuns in 70 monasteries, and 13 affiliated Congregations and Institutes. In addition, the Third Order of lay Carmelites count 25,000\u201330,000 members throughout the world. Provinces exist in Australia, Brazil, Britain, Canada, Chile, Croatia, Hungary, Germany, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, Spain, Portugal and the United States. Delegations directly under the Prior General exist in Argentina, France, the Czech Republic, the Dominican Republic, Lebanon, the Philippines and Portugal.\nCarmelite Missions exist in Bolivia, Burkino Faso, Cameroon, Colombia, India, Kenya, Lithuania, Mexico, Mozambique, Peru, Romania, Tanzania, Trinidad, Venezuela and Zimbabwe.\nMonasteries of enclosed Carmelite nuns exist in Brazil, Canada, Croatia, Denmark, the Dominican Republic, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Indonesia, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Kenya, the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand (in Christchurch since 1933), Nicaragua, Norway, Peru, the Philippines, Spain, Sweden, Portugal, the United Kingdom and the United States. Hermit communities of either men or women exist in Brazil, France, Indonesia, Lebanon, Italy and the United States.\nThe Discalced Carmelite Order built the priory of Elijah (1911) at the site of Elijah's epic contest with the prophets of Ba'al (1 Kings 18:20\u201340). The monastery is situated about 25 kilometers south of Haifa on the eastern side of the Carmel, and stands on the foundations of a series of earlier monasteries. The site is held sacred by Christians, Druze, Jews and Muslims; the name of the area is \"el-Muhraqa,\" an Arabic construction meaning \"place of burning\", and is a direct reference to the biblical account.\nSeveral Carmelite saints have received significant attention in the 20th and 21st centuries. In 1970, Teresa of Avila became the first woman to be named a Doctor of the Church. In 1997, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux became one of only four female Doctors of the Church, so named because of her famous teaching on the \"way of confidence and love\" set forth in her best-selling memoir, \"Story of a Soul\". The Martyrs of Compi\u00e8gne, murdered during the French Revolution, inspired a 1931 novella followed by a play, an opera, and a film. Notable 20th century Carmelites include Titus Brandsma, a Dutch scholar and writer who was killed in Dachau concentration camp because of his stance against Nazism; Teresa Benedicta of the Cross (n\u00e9e Edith Stein), a Jewish convert to Catholicism who was imprisoned and murdered at Auschwitz; and three nuns of Guadalajara who were martyred on 24 July 1936 by Spanish Republicans.\nRaphael Kalinowski (1835\u20131907) was the first friar to be canonized in the order since co-founder John of the Cross. The writings and teachings of Brother Lawrence of the Resurrection, a Carmelite friar of the 17th century, continue as a spiritual classic under the title \"The Practice of the Presence of God\". Other non-religious (\"i.e.,\" non-vowed monastic) great figures include George Preca, a Maltese priest and Carmelite Tertiary. The Feast of All Carmelite Saints and Blesseds is celebrated on 14 November.\nCarmelite spirituality.\nHabit and scapular.\nIn 1287, the original way of life of the order was changed to conform to that of the mendicant orders on the initiative of Simon Stock and at the command of Pope Innocent IV. Their former habit of a mantle with black and white or brown and white stripes\u00a0\u2013 the black or brown stripes representing the scorches the mantle of Elijah received from the fiery chariot as it fell from his shoulders\u00a0\u2013 was discarded. They wore the same habit as the Dominicans, except that the cloak was white. They also borrowed much from the Dominican and Franciscan constitutions. Their distinctive garment was a scapular of two strips of dark cloth, worn on the breast and back, and fastened at the shoulders. Tradition holds that this was given to Simon Stock by the Blessed Virgin Mary, who appeared to him and promised that all who wore it with faith and piety and who died clothed in it would be saved. There arose a sodality of the scapular, which affiliated a large number of laymen with the Carmelites.\nA miniature version of the Carmelite scapular is popular among Catholics and is one of the most popular devotions in the church. Wearers usually believe that if they faithfully wear the Carmelite scapular (also called \"the brown scapular\" or simply \"the scapular\") and die in a state of grace, they will be saved from eternal torment. Catholics who decide to wear the scapular are usually enrolled by a priest, and some choose to enter the Scapular Confraternity. The Lay Carmelites of the Third Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel wear a scapular which is smaller than the shortened scapular worn by some Carmelite religious for sleeping, but still larger than the devotional scapulars.\nVisions and devotions.\nAmong the various Catholic orders, Carmelite nuns have had a proportionally high ratio of visions of Jesus and Mary and have been responsible for key Catholic devotions.\nFrom the time of her clothing in the Carmelite religious habit (1583) until her death (1607), Mary Magdalene de' Pazzi is said to have had a series of raptures and ecstasies.\nIn the Carmelite convent of Beja, in Portugal, two Carmelite nuns of the Ancient Observance reported several apparitions and mystical revelations throughout their life: Mariana of the Purification received numerous apparitions of the Child Jesus and her body was found incorrupt after her death; Maria Perp\u00e9tua da Luz wrote 60 books with messages from heaven; both religious died with the odor of sanctity.\nIn the 19th century, another Carmelite nun, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux, was instrumental in spreading devotion to the Holy Face throughout France in the 1890s with her many poems and prayers. Eventually Pope Pius XII approved the devotion in 1958 and declared the Feast of the Holy Face of Jesus as Shrove Tuesday (the day before Ash Wednesday) for all Catholics. Therese of Lisieux emerged as one of the most popular saints for Catholics in the 20th century, and a statue of her can be found in many European and North American Catholic churches built prior to the Second Vatican Council (after which the number of statues tended to be reduced when churches were built).\nIn the 20th century, in the last apparition of the Blessed Virgin Mary in F\u00e1tima, Portugal, Sister L\u00facia, one of the most famous visionaries of Our Lady, said that the Virgin appeared to her as Our Lady of Mount Carmel (holding the Brown Scapular). Many years after, L\u00facia became a Carmelite nun. When L\u00facia was asked in an interview why the Blessed Virgin appeared as Our Lady of Mount Carmel in her last apparition, she replied: \"Because Our Lady wants all to wear the Scapular... The reason for this\", she explained, \"is that the Scapular is our sign of consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary\". When asked if the Brown Scapular is as necessary to the fulfillment of Our Lady's requests as the rosary, L\u00facia answered: \"The Scapular and the Rosary are inseparable\".\nMany Carmelites have been canonized by the Catholic Church as saints. The Feast of All Carmelite Saints is celebrated on 14 November. The Commemoration of All the Departed of the Carmelite Order occurs on 15 November.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The president's prerogatives and duties are determined in the Constitution of Poland. The president jointly exercises the executive power together with the Council of Ministers headed by the prime minister. The president has a right to dissolve both chambers of parliament in certain cases determined by the constitution, can veto legislation, represents the Republic on the international stage, and is the commander-in-chief of the nation's Armed Forces.\nHistory.\nThe first president of Poland, Gabriel Narutowicz, was sworn in as president of the Second Polish Republic on 11 December 1922. He was elected by the National Assembly (the Sejm and the Senate) under the terms of the 1921 March Constitution. Narutowicz was assassinated on 16 December 1922. Previously J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski had been \"Chief of State\" (\"Naczelnik Pa\u0144stwa\") under the provisional Small Constitution of 1919. In 1926 Pi\u0142sudski staged the \"May Coup\", overthrew President Stanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski and had the National Assembly elect a new one, Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki, thus establishing the \"Sanation regime\". Before Pi\u0142sudski's death, parliament passed a more authoritarian 1935 April Constitution of Poland (not in accord with the amendment procedures of the 1921 March Constitution). Mo\u015bcicki continued as president until he resigned in 1939 in the aftermath of the German invasion of Poland. Mo\u015bcicki and his government went into exile in Romania, where Mo\u015bcicki was interned. In Angers, France, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Raczkiewicz, at the time the speaker of the Senate, assumed the presidency after Mo\u015bcicki's resignation on 29 September 1939. Following the fall of France, the president and the Polish government-in-exile were evacuated to London, United Kingdom. The transfer from Mo\u015bcicki to Raczkiewicz was in accordance with Article 24 of the 1935 April Constitution. Raczkiewicz was followed by a succession of presidents in exile, of whom the last one was Ryszard Kaczorowski.\nIn 1945\u201354, Poland became a part of Soviet-controlled central-eastern Europe. Boles\u0142aw Bierut assumed the reins of government and in July 1945 was internationally recognised as the head of state. The Senate was abolished in 1946 by the Polish people's referendum. When the Sejm passed the Small Constitution of 1947, based in part on the 1921 March Constitution, Bierut was elected president by that body. He served until the Constitution of the Polish People's Republic of 1952 eliminated the office of the president, replacing it with a collective leadership called the Council of State ().\nFollowing the 1989 amendments to the constitution which restored the presidency, general Wojciech Jaruzelski, the existing head of state, took office. In Poland's first direct presidential election, Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa won and was sworn in on 22 December 1990. The office of the president was preserved in the Constitution of Poland passed in 1997; the constitution now provides the requirements for, the duties of and the authority of the office.\nThe topic of creation the presidency role as a single-person position was meant to safeguard slow, gentle political change to keep the interests of the ruling party. By March 1989, a compromise regarding the creation of the institution of the presidency was reached between the government and the opposition. In return for a constitutionally defined presidency with various competences, the ruling party agreed to relinquish its position as managing organ within the state. The presidency would be created along with the restoration of a freely elected upper house, the Senate. The president would be elected by a joint session of the lower house (Sejm) and the Senate. By this way, representatives of the opposition, sitting in the Senate, would be involved in the political process of electing the president.\nThe Small constitution of October 17, 1992 created a parliamentarisation of the political system and while the presidency remained in the active model, it was deprived of far-reaching governing powers.\nIn recent years, newly elected presidents have renounced formal ties with their political party before taking office.\nElection.\nThe president of Poland is elected directly by the people to serve for five years and can be reelected only once. Pursuant to the provisions of the Constitution, the president is elected by an absolute majority. If no candidate succeeds in passing this threshold, a second round of voting is held with the participation of the two candidates with the largest and second largest number of votes respectively.\nIn order to be registered as a candidate in the presidential election, one must be a Polish citizen, be at least 35 years old on the day of the first round of the election, and collect at least 100,000 signatures of registered voters.\nPowers.\nArticle 126 paragraph 1 states that the president is the supreme representative of the state, rather than the people, a privilege reserved for the deputies of the Sejm and senators of the Senate. The constitution confirms for the president the role of securing the continuity of state authority. The position of the presidency has an arbiter function (while not directly mentioned, unlike France or Romania), with the president playing a major role in the political system, assisted by a set of legal instruments with which they can exert influence on the organs of state authority and the political system.\nThe president has a free choice in selecting the prime minister, yet in practice they usually give the task of forming a new government to a politician supported by the political party with the majority of seats in the Sejm (usually, though not always, it is the leader of that political party).\nThe president has the right to initiate the legislative process. They also have the opportunity to directly influence it by using their veto to stop a bill; however, a veto can be overruled by a three-fifths majority vote in the presence of at least half of the statutory number of members of the Sejm (230). Before signing a bill into law, the president can also ask the Constitutional Tribunal to verify its compliance with the Constitution, which in practice bears a decisive influence on the legislative process.\nIn their role as supreme representative of the Polish state, the president has the power to ratify and revoke international agreements, nominates and recalls ambassadors, and formally accepts the accreditations of representatives of other states. The president also makes decisions on award of highest academic titles, as well as state distinctions and orders. In addition, they have the right of clemency, viz. they can dismiss final court verdicts (in practice, the president consults such decisions with the minister of justice).\nThe president is also the commander-in-chief of the armed forces; they appoint the chief of the general staff and the commanders of all of the service branches; in wartime, they nominate the supreme commander of the Armed Forces and can order a general mobilisation. The president performs their duties with the help of the following offices: the Chancellery of the President, the Office of National Security, and the Body of Advisors to the President.\nPresidential residencies and properties.\nSeveral properties are owned by the Office of the President and are used by the head of state as their official residence, private residence, residence for visiting foreign officials etc.\nActing president of Poland.\nThe constitution states that the president is an elected office, there is no directly elected presidential line of succession. If the president is unable to execute their powers and duties, the marshal of the Sejm will have the powers of a president for a maximum of 60 days until elections are called.\nOn 10 April 2010, a plane carrying Polish president Lech Kaczy\u0144ski, his wife, and 94 others including many Polish officials crashed near Smolensk North Airport in Russia; there were no survivors. Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski took over acting presidential powers following the incident. On 8 July, Komorowski resigned from the office of Marshal of the Sejm after winning the presidential election. According to the constitution, the acting president then became the marshal of the Senate, Bogdan Borusewicz. In the afternoon Grzegorz Schetyna was elected as a new marshal of the Sejm and he became acting president. Schetyna served as the interim head of state until the swearing-in of Komorowski on 6 August.\nFormer presidents.\nWithin Poland, former presidents are entitled to lifetime personal security protection by State Protection Service officers, in addition to receiving a substantial pension and a private office. On 10 April 2010, Lech Kaczy\u0144ski, president at the time, along with Ryszard Kaczorowski, the last president-in-exile although not internationally recognised as such, died in the crash of a Polish Air Force Tu-154 en route to Russia to mark the 70th anniversary of the Katyn massacre.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Historically, begging the question refers to a fault in a dialectical argument in which the speaker assumes some premise that has not been demonstrated to be true. In modern usage, it has come to refer to an argument in which the premises assume the conclusion without supporting it. This makes it an example of circular reasoning.\nSome examples are: \nThe phrase \"beg the question\" is often used to mean \"strongly prompt the question\", a usage distinct from that in logic. This usage is criticized for diluting the original logical meaning of the phrase.\nHistory.\nThe original phrase used by Aristotle from which \"begging the question\" descends is , or sometimes , 'asking for the initial thing'. Aristotle's intended meaning is closely tied to the type of dialectical argument he discusses in his \"Topics\", book VIII: a formalized debate in which the defending party asserts a thesis that the attacking party must attempt to refute by asking yes-or-no questions and deducing some inconsistency between the responses and the original thesis.\nIn this stylized form of debate, the proposition that the answerer undertakes to defend is called 'the initial thing' () and one of the rules of the debate is that the questioner cannot simply ask (beg) for it (that would be trivial and uninteresting). Aristotle discusses this in \"Sophistical Refutations\" and in \"Prior Analytics\" book II, (64b, 34\u201365a 9, for circular reasoning see 57b, 18\u201359b, 1).\nThe stylized dialectical exchanges Aristotle discusses in the \"Topics\" included rules for scoring the debate, and one important issue was precisely the matter of \"asking for the initial thing\"\u2014which included not just making the actual thesis adopted by the answerer into a question, but also making a question out of a sentence that was too close to that thesis (for example, \"PA\" II 16).\nThe term was translated into English from Latin in the 16th century. The Latin version, 'asking for the starting point', can be interpreted in different ways. (from ), in the post-classical context in which the phrase arose, means 'assuming' or 'postulating', but in the older classical sense means 'petition', 'request' or 'beseeching'. , genitive of , means 'beginning', 'basis' or 'premise' (of an argument). Literally means 'assuming the premise' or 'assuming the original point'.\nThe Latin phrase comes from the Greek ( 'asking the original point') in Aristotle's \"Prior Analytics\" II xvi 64b28\u201365a26:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Aristotle\u2014\u200a\nAristotle's distinction between apodictic science and other forms of nondemonstrative knowledge rests on an epistemology and metaphysics wherein appropriate first principles become apparent to the trained dialectician:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Aristotle's advice in \"S.E.\" 27 for resolving fallacies of Begging the Question is brief. If one realizes that one is being asked to concede the original point, one should refuse to do so, even if the point being asked is a reputable belief. On the other hand, if one fails to realize that one has conceded the point at issue and the questioner uses the concession to produce the apparent refutation, then one should turn the tables on the sophistical opponent by oneself pointing out the fallacy committed. In dialectical exchange, it is a worse mistake to be caught asking for the original point than to have inadvertently granted such a request. The answerer in such a position has failed to detect when different utterances mean the same thing. The questioner, if he did not realize he was asking the original point, has committed the same error. But if he has knowingly asked for the original point, then he reveals himself to be ontologically confused: he has mistaken what is non-self-explanatory (known through other things) to be something self-explanatory (known through itself). In pointing this out to the false reasoner, one is not just pointing out a tactical psychological misjudgment by the questioner. It is not simply that the questioner falsely thought that the original point is placed under the guise of a semantic equivalent, or a logical equivalent, or a covering universal, or divided up into exhaustive parts, would be more persuasive to the answerer. Rather, the questioner falsely thought that a non-self-explanatory fact about the world was an explanatory first principle. For Aristotle, that certain facts are self-explanatory while others are not is not a reflection solely of the cognitive abilities of humans. It is primarily a reflection of the structure of noncognitive reality. In short, a successful resolution of such a fallacy requires a firm grasp of the correct explanatory powers of things. Without a knowledge of which things are self-explanatory and which are not the reasoner is liable to find a question-begging argument persuasive.\u2014\u200a\nThomas Fowler believed that would be more properly called , which is literally 'begging the question'.\nDefinition.\nTo 'beg the question' (also called ) is to attempt to support a claim with a premise that itself restates or presupposes the claim. It is an attempt to prove a proposition while simultaneously taking the proposition for granted.\nWhen the fallacy involves only a single variable, it is sometimes called a \"hysteron proteron\" (Greek for 'later earlier'), a rhetorical device, as in the statement:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Opium induces sleep because it has a \"soporific\" quality.\nReading this sentence, the only thing one can learn is a new word (soporific) that refers to a more common action (inducing sleep); it does not explain why opium causes that effect. A sentence that explains why opium often induces sleep (or the same, why opium has soporific quality) is\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Opium often induces sleep because it contains morphine, an opioid which activates \u03bc-opioid receptors in the central nervous system, a type of inhibitory receptor whose activation is often sufficient to induce sleep.\nwhere the specific physiological processes are omitted for simplicity. A less obvious example from \"Fallacies and Pitfalls of Language: The Language Trap\" by S. Morris Engel:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Free trade will be good for this country. The reason is patently clear. Isn't it obvious that unrestricted commercial relations will bestow on all sections of this nation the benefits which result when there is an unimpeded flow of goods between countries?\nThis form of the fallacy may not be immediately obvious. Linguistic variations in syntax, sentence structure, and the literary device may conceal it, as may other factors involved in an argument's delivery. It may take the form of an unstated premise which is essential but not identical to the conclusion, or is \"controversial or questionable for the same reasons that typically might lead someone to question the conclusion\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFor example, one can obscure the fallacy by first making a statement in concrete terms, then attempting to pass off an identical statement, delivered in abstract terms, as evidence for the original. One could also \"bring forth a proposition expressed in words of Saxon origin, and give as a reason for it the very same proposition stated in words of Norman origin\", as here:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To allow every man an unbounded freedom of speech must always be, on the whole, advantageous to the State, for it is highly conducive to the interests of the community that each individual should enjoy a liberty perfectly unlimited of expressing his sentiments.\"\nWhen the fallacy of begging the question is committed in more than one step, some authors dub it 'reasoning in a circle', or more commonly, \"circular reasoning\".\nBegging the question is usually not considered a formal fallacy (an argument that is defective because it uses an incorrect deductive step). Rather, it is usually a type of informal fallacy that is logically valid but unpersuasive, in that it fails to prove anything other than what is already assumed. There are some exceptions wherein it may be considered a formal fallacy, such as in non-reflexive logics.\nRelated fallacies.\nClosely connected with begging the question is the fallacy of circular reasoning (), a fallacy in which the reasoner begins with the conclusion. The individual components of a circular argument can be logically valid because if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true, and does not lack relevance. However, circular reasoning is not persuasive because a listener who doubts the conclusion also doubts the premise that leads to it.\nBegging the question is similar to the \"complex question\" (also known as \"trick question\" or \"fallacy of many questions\"): a question that, to be valid, requires the truth of another question that has not been established. For example, \"Which color dress is Mary wearing?\" may be fallacious because it presupposes that Mary is wearing a dress. Unless it has previously been established that her outfit is a dress, the question is fallacious because she could be wearing pants instead.\nAnother related fallacy is \"ignoratio elenchi\" or \"irrelevant conclusion\": an argument that fails to address the issue in question, but appears to do so. An example might be a situation where A and B are debating whether the law permits A to do something. If A attempts to support his position with an argument that the law ought to allow him to do the thing in question, then he is guilty of .\nVernacular.\nIn vernacular English, \"begging the question\" (or equivalent rephrasing thereof) is sometimes used in place of \"raises the question\", \"invites the question\", \"suggests the question\", \"leaves unanswered the question\" etc. Such preface is then followed with the question, as in: \nSometimes it is further confused with \"dodging the question\", an attempt to avoid it, or perhaps more often \"begging the question\" is simply used to mean leaving the question unanswered.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The movement was later joined by the younger Carmelite friar and mystic Saint John of the Cross, with whom she established the Discalced Carmelites. A formal papal decree adopting the split from the old order was issued in 1580.\nHer autobiography, \"The Life of Teresa of Jesus\", and her books \"The Interior Castle\" and \" The Way of Perfection\" are prominent works on Christian mysticism and Christian meditation practice. In her autobiography, written as a defense of her ecstatic mystical experiences, she discerns four stages in the ascent of the soul to God: mental prayer and meditation; the prayer of quiet; absorption-in-God; ecstatic consciousness. \"The Interior Castle\", written as a spiritual guide for her Carmelite sisters, uses the illustration of seven mansions within the castle of the soul to describe the different states one's soul can be in during life.\nForty years after her death, in 1622, Teresa was canonized by Pope Gregory XV. On 27 September 1970 Pope Paul VI proclaimed Teresa the first female \"Doctor of the Church\" in recognition of her centuries-long spiritual legacy to Catholicism.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nTeresa S\u00e1nchez de Cepeda D\u00e1vila y Ahumada was born on 28 March 1515. Her birthplace was either \u00c1vila or Gotarrendura. Her paternal grandfather, Juan S\u00e1nchez de Toledo, was a or , a Jew forced to convert to Christianity or emigrate. When Teresa's father was a child, Juan was condemned by the Spanish Inquisition for allegedly returning to Judaism, but he was later able to assume a Catholic identity. Her father, , was a successful wool merchant and one of the wealthiest men in \u00c1vila. He bought a knighthood and assimilated successfully into Christian society.\nS\u00e1nchez de Cepeda was previously married to Catalina del Peso y Henao, with whom he had three children. In 1509, he married Teresa's mother, Beatriz de Ahumada y Cuevas, in Gotarrendura. Her brother, Lorenzo de Cepeda y Ahumada, was the father of Teresa de Ahumada.\nTeresa's mother raised her as a dedicated Christian. Fascinated by accounts of the lives of the saints, she ran away from home at age seven with her brother Rodrigo to seek martyrdom in the fight against the Moors. Her uncle brought them home when he spotted them just outside the town walls.\nWhen Teresa was fourteen years old, her mother died, leaving her grief-stricken. This prompted her to embrace a deeper devotion to the Virgin Mary as her spiritual mother. Teresa was also enamored with popular fiction, which at the time consisted primarily of medieval tales of knighthood and works about fashion, gardens and flowers. Teresa was sent to the Augustinian nuns' school in \u00c1vila.\nReligious life.\nAscetic and mystical practice.\nAfter completing her education, she initially resisted the idea of a religious vocation, but she eventually relented after a stay with her uncle and other relatives. In 1534, aged 20, much to the disappointment of her pious and austere father, she decided to enter the local, easy-going Carmelite \"Convent of the Incarnation\", built on land that had previously been used as a burial ground for Jews. She took up religious reading on contemplative prayer, including Osuna's \"Abecedario espiritual\" (\"Third Spiritual Alphabet,\" 1527), a guide on the examination of conscience and \"spiritual self-concentration and inner contemplation, known in mystical nomenclature as \". She also dipped into other mystical ascetical works such as the of Peter of Alcantara.\nHer zeal for mortification caused her to become ill and she spent almost a year in bed, causing huge worry to her community and family. She nearly died but she recovered, attributing her recovery to the miraculous intercession of Saint Joseph. She began to experience bouts of religious ecstasy. She reported that, during her illness, she had progressed from the lowest stage of \"recollection\", to the \"devotions of silence\" and even to the \"devotions of ecstasy\", in which was one of perceived in \"perfect union with God\" (see ). She said she frequently experienced the rich \"blessing of tears\" during this final stage. As the Catholic distinction between mortal and venial sin became clear to her, she came to understand the awful horror of sin and the inherent nature of original sin. \nAround the same time, she received a copy of the full Spanish translation of Augustine of Hippo's autobiographical work \"Confessions\", which helped her resolve and to tend to her own bouts of religious scruples. The text helped her realize that holiness was indeed possible and she found solace in the idea that such a great saint was once an inveterate sinner. In her autobiography, she wrote that she \"was very fond of St. Augustine[...] for he was a sinner too\".\n\"Transverberation\".\nAround 1556, friends suggested that her newfound knowledge could be of diabolical rather than divine origin. She had begun to inflict mortifications of the flesh upon herself. But her confessor, the Jesuit Francis Borgia, reassured her of the divine inspiration of her thoughts. On St. Peter's Day in 1559, Teresa became firmly convinced that Jesus Christ had presented himself to her in bodily form, though invisible. These visions lasted almost uninterruptedly for more than two years. In another vision, the famous \"transverberation\", a seraph drove the fiery point of a golden lance repeatedly through her heart, causing her an ineffable spiritual and bodily pain:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I saw in his hand a long spear of gold, and at the point there seemed to be a little fire. He appeared to me to be thrusting it at times into my heart, and to pierce my very entrails; when he drew it out, he seemed to draw them out also, and to leave me all on fire with a great love of God. The pain was so great, that it made me moan; and yet so surpassing was the sweetness of this excessive pain, that I could not wish to be rid of it\u00a0...\nThe account of this vision was the inspiration for one of Bernini's most famous works, the \"Ecstasy of Saint Teresa\" at Santa Maria della Vittoria in Rome. Although based in part on Teresa's description of her mystical transverberation in her autobiography, Bernini's depiction of the event is considered by some to be highly eroticized, especially when compared to the entire preceding artistic Teresian tradition.\nThe memory of this episode served as an inspiration throughout the rest of her life, and motivated her lifelong imitation of the life and suffering of Jesus, epitomized in the adage often associated with her: \"Lord, either let me suffer or let me die.\"\nTeresa, who became a celebrity in her town for dispensing wisdom from behind the convent grille, was known for her raptures, which sometimes involved levitation. It was a source of embarrassment to her and she bade her sisters hold her down when this occurred. Subsequently, historians, neurologists, and psychiatrists like Peter Fenwick and Javier \u00c1lvarez-Rodr\u00edguez, among others, have taken an interest in her symptomatology. The fact that she wrote down virtually everything that happened to her during her religious life means that an invaluable and exceedingly rare medical record from the 16th century has been preserved. Examination of this record has led to the speculative conclusion that she may have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy.\nMonastic reformer.\nOver time, Teresa found herself increasingly at odds with the spiritual malaise prevailing in her convent of the Incarnation. Among the 150 nuns living there, the observance of cloister, designed to protect and strengthen spiritual practice and prayer, became so lax that it appeared to lose its purpose. The daily invasion of visitors, many of high social and political rank, disturbed the atmosphere with frivolous concerns and vacuous conversation. Such intrusions in the solitude essential to develop and sustain contemplative prayer so grieved Teresa that she longed to intervene.\nThe incentive to take the practical steps inspired by her inward motivation was supported by the Franciscan priest, Peter of Alcantara, who met her early in 1560 and became her spiritual adviser. She resolved to found a \"reformed\" Carmelite convent, correcting the laxity which she had found at the Incarnation convent and elsewhere besides. Do\u00f1a Guiomar of Ulloa, a friend, was granted permission for the project.\nThe abject poverty of the new convent, established in 1562 and named St. Joseph's (San Jos\u00e9), at first caused a scandal among the citizens and authorities of \u00c1vila, and the small house with its chapel was in peril of suppression. However, powerful patrons, including the local bishop, coupled with the impression of well ordered subsistence and purpose, turned animosity into approval.\nIn March 1563, after Teresa had moved to the new convent house, she received papal sanction for her primary principles of absolute poverty and renunciation of ownership of property, which she proceeded to formulate into a \"constitution\". Her plan was the revival of the earlier, stricter monastic rules, supplemented by new regulations including the three disciplines of ceremonial flagellation prescribed for the Divine Office every week, and the discalceation of the religious. For the first five years, Teresa remained in seclusion, mostly engaged in prayer and writing.\nExtended travels.\nIn 1567, Teresa received a patent from the Carmelite General, Rubeo de Ravenna, to establish further houses of the new order. This process required many visitations and long journeys across nearly all the provinces of Spain. She left a record of the arduous project in her \"Libro de las Fundaciones\". Between 1567 and 1571, reformed convents were established at Medina del Campo, Malag\u00f3n, Valladolid, Toledo, Pastrana, Salamanca, and Alba de Tormes.\nAs part of the original patent, Teresa was given permission to set up two houses for men who wished to adopt the reforms. She convinced two Carmelite friars, John of the Cross and Anthony of Jesus to help with this. They founded the first monastery of Discalced Carmelite brothers in November 1568 at Duruelo. Another friend of Teresa, Jer\u00f3nimo Graci\u00e1n, the Carmelite visitator of the older observance of Andalusia and apostolic commissioner, and later provincial of the Teresian order, gave her powerful support in founding monasteries at Segovia (1571), Beas de Segura (1574), Seville (1575), and Caravaca de la Cruz (Murcia, 1576). Meanwhile, John of the Cross promoted the inner life of the movement through his power as a teacher and preacher.\nOpposition to reforms.\nIn 1576, unreformed members of the Carmelite order began to persecute Teresa, her supporters and her reforms. Following a number of resolutions adopted at the general chapter at Piacenza, the governing body of the order forbade all further founding of reformed convents. The general chapter instructed her to go into \"voluntary\" retirement at one of her institutions. She obeyed and chose St. Joseph's at Toledo. Meanwhile, her friends and associates were subjected to further attacks.\nSeveral years later, her appeals by letter to King Philip II of Spain secured relief. As a result, in 1579, the cases before the inquisition against her, Graci\u00e1n and others, were dropped. This allowed the reform to resume. An edict from Pope Gregory XIII allowed the appointment of a special provincial for the newer branch of the Carmelite religious, and a royal decree created a \"protective\" board of four assessors for the reform.\nDuring the last three years of her life, Teresa founded convents at Villanueva de la Jara in northern Andalusia (1580), Palencia (1580), Soria (1581), Burgos, and Granada (1582). In total, seventeen convents, all but one founded by her, and as many men's monasteries, were owed to her reforms over twenty years.\nLast days.\nHer final illness overtook her on one of her journeys from Burgos to Alba de Tormes. She died in 1582, just as Catholic Europe was making the switch from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar, which required the excision of the dates of 5\u201314 October from the calendar. She died either before midnight of 4 October or early in the morning of 15 October, which is celebrated as her feast day. According to the liturgical calendar then in use, she died on the 15th. Her last words were, \"My Lord, it is time to move on. Well then, may your will be done. O my Lord and my Spouse, the hour that I have longed for has come. It is time to meet one another.\"\nAfter death.\nHoly relics.\nShe was buried at the Convento de la Anunciaci\u00f3n in Alba de Tormes. Nine months after her death the coffin was opened and her body was found to be intact but the clothing had rotted. Before the body was re-interred one of her hands was cut off, wrapped in a scarf and sent to \u00c1vila. Graci\u00e1n cut the little finger off the hand and \u2013 according to his own account \u2013 kept it with him until he was captured by Barbary corsairs when sailing from Messina to Rome, from whom he had to redeem it with a few rings and 20 reales. The body was exhumed again on 25 November 1585 to be moved to \u00c1vila and found to be incorrupt. An arm was removed and left in Alba de Tormes at the nuns' request, to compensate for losing the main relic of Teresa, but the rest of the body was reburied in the Discalced Carmelite chapter house in \u00c1vila. The removal was done without the approval of the Duke of Alba de Tormes and he brought the body back in 1586, with Pope Sixtus V ordering that it remain in Alba de Tormes on pain of excommunication. A grander tomb on the original site was raised in 1598 and the body was moved to a new chapel in 1616.\nThe body still remains there, except for the following parts:\nOn August 28, 2024, it was made the canonical recognition of Teresa's body. The postulator general of the Order of Discalced Carmelites, Father Marco Chiesa, announced that those present at the scene were able to see that \"it is in the same condition as when it was last opened in 1914.\"\nWhen the body was publicly exposed in May 2025, netizens questioned the incorrupted state of the corpse, given its apparent condition.\nCanonization.\nIn 1622, forty years after her death, she was canonized by Pope Gregory XV. The Cortes exalted her to patroness of Spain in 1627. The University of Salamanca had granted her the title (Latin for \"Doctor of the Church\") with a diploma in her lifetime, but that title is distinct from the papal honour of Doctor of the Church, which is always conferred posthumously. The latter was finally bestowed upon her by Pope Paul VI on 27 September 1970, along with Catherine of Siena, making them the first women to be awarded the distinction. Teresa is revered as \"Doctor orationis\" (\"Doctor of Prayer\"). The mysticism in her works exerted a formative influence upon many theologians of the following centuries, such as Francis of Sales, F\u00e9nelon, and the Port-Royalists. In 1670, her coffin was plated in silver.\nTeresa of Avila is honored in the Church of England and in the Episcopal Church on 15 October.\nPatron saint.\nIn 1626, at the request of Philip IV of Spain, the Castilian parliament elected Teresa \"without lacking one vote\" as copatron saint of Castile. This status was affirmed by Pope Urban VIII in a brief issued on 21 July 1627 in which he stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For these reasons [the king's and Cortes's elections] and for the great devotion which they have for Teresa, they elected her for patron and advocate of these kingdoms in the last Cortes of the aforementioned kingdoms\u00a0... And because\u00a0... the representatives in the Cortes desired it so greatly that their vote be firm and perpetual, we grant it our patronage and the approval of the Holy Apostolic See.\nMore broadly, the 1620s, the entirety of Spain (Castile and beyond) debated who should be the country's patron saint; the choices were either the current patron, James Matamoros, or a pairing of him and the newly canonised Saint Teresa of \u00c1vila. Teresa's promoters said Spain faced newer challenges, especially the threat of Protestantism and societal decline at home, thus needing a more contemporary patron who understood those issues and could guide the Spanish nation. Santiago's supporters (\"Santiaguistas\") fought back and eventually won the argument, but Teresa of \u00c1vila remained far more popular at the local level. James the Great kept the title of patron saint for the Spanish people, and the most Blessed Virgin Mary under the title Immaculate Conception as the sole patroness for the entire Spanish Kingdom.\nLegacy regarding the Infant Jesus of Prague.\nThe Spanish nuns who established \"Carmel\" in France brought a devotion to the Infant Jesus with them, and it became widespread in France.\nThough there are no written historical accounts establishing that Teresa of \u00c1vila ever owned the famous Infant Jesus of Prague statue, according to tradition, such a statue is said to have been in her possession and Teresa is reputed to have given it to a noblewoman travelling to Prague. The age of the statue dates to approximately the same time as Teresa. It has been thought that Teresa carried a portable statue of the Child Jesus wherever she went; the idea circulated by the early 1700s.\nWritings.\nAutobiography.\nThe autobiography \"La Vida de la Santa Madre Teresa de Jes\u00fas\" (\"The Life of the Holy Mother Teresa of Jesus\") was written at Avila between 1562 and 1565, but published posthumously. Editions include:\n\"The Way of Perfection\".\n\"The Way of Perfection\" (\"\") was published in 1566. Teresa called this a \"living book\" and in it set out to teach her nuns how to progress through prayer and Christian meditation. She discusses the rationale for being a Carmelite, and the rest deals with the purpose of and approaches to spiritual life. The title was inspired by the devotional book \"The Imitation of Christ\" (1418) which had become a favourite expression of Teresa much before she wrote this work, as it appeared at several places in her autobiography, \"The Life of Teresa of Jesus\". Like her other books, \"The Way of Perfection\" was written on the advice of her counsellors to describe her experiences in prayer during the period when the Reformation was spreading through Europe. Herein she describes ways of attaining spiritual perfection through prayer and its four stages, as in meditation, quiet, repose of soul and finally perfect union with God, which she equates with rapture.\n\"Interior Castle\".\nThe \"Interior Castle\", or \"The Mansions\", (\"\" or \"Las Moradas\") was written in 1577, and published in 1588. It contained the basis for what she felt should be the ideal journey of faith, comparing the contemplative soul to a castle with seven successive interior courts, or chambers, analogous to the seven mansions. The work was inspired by her vision of the soul as a diamond in the shape of a castle containing seven mansions, which she interpreted as the journey of faith through seven stages, ending with union with God. Fray Diego, one of Teresa's former confessors wrote that God revealed to Teresa:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... a most beautiful crystal globe, made in the shape of a castle, and containing seven mansions, in the seventh and innermost of which was the King of Glory, in the greatest splendour, illumining and beautifying them all. The nearer one got to the centre, the stronger was the light; outside the palace limits everything was foul, dark and infested with toads, vipers and other venomous creatures.\"\nChristia Mercer, Columbia University philosophy professor, claims that the seventeenth-century Frenchman Ren\u00e9 Descartes lifted some of his most influential ideas from Teresa of \u00c1vila, who, fifty years before Descartes, wrote popular books about the role of philosophical reflection in intellectual growth. She describes a number of striking similarities between Descartes's seminal work \"Meditations on First Philosophy\" and Teresa's \"Interior Castle\".\nIn popular culture.\nSt. Teresa's mystical experiences have inspired several authors in modern times, but not necessarily from Teresa's Christian theological perspective.\nMysticism.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe prayer \"Nada te turbe\" (Let nothing disturb you) is attributed to Teresa, having been found within her breviary:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\nThe ultimate preoccupation of Teresa's mystical thought, as consistently reflected in her writings, is the ascent of the soul to God. Aumann notes that \"the grades of prayer described in \"The Life\" do not correspond to the division of prayer commonly given in the manuals of the spiritual\", including due to the fact that \"St. Teresa did not write a systematic theology of prayer\". According to Zimmerman, \"In all her writings on this subject she deals with her personal experiences [...] there is no vestige in her writings of any influence of the Areopagite, the Patristic, or the Scholastic Mystical schools, as represented among others, by the German Dominican Mystics. She is intensely personal, her system going exactly as far as her experiences, but not a step further.\"\nTeresa describes in the \"Interior Castle\" that the treasure of heaven lies buried within our hearts, and that there is an interior part of the heart which is the centre of the soul.\nFour stages as described in the \"autobiography\".\nIn her autobiography she describes four stages, in which she uses the image of watering one's garden as a metaphor for mystical prayer:\nThe seven mansions of the Interior castle.\nThe \"Interior Castle\" is divided into seven mansions (also called dwelling places), each level describing a step to get closer to God. In her work, Teresa already assumed entrance into the first mansions by prayer and meditation.\nThe purgative stage, involving active prayer and asceticism:\nThe illuminative stage, the beginning of mystical or contemplative or supernatural prayer:\nUnitive stage:\nNine grades of prayer.\nOverview.\nThe first four grades of Teresa's classifications of prayer belong to the ascetical stage of spiritual life. These are vocal prayer, meditational or mental prayer, affective prayer, and acquired or natural recollection.\nAccording to Augustin Poulain and Robert Thouless, Teresa described four degrees or stages of mystical union, namely the prayer of quiet, full or semi-ecstatic union, ecstatic union or ecstasy, and transforming or deifying union, or spiritual marriage (properly) of the soul with God. While Augustin Poulain and Robert Thouless do not mention the \"Prayer of Supernatural (or passive) Recollection\" as a separate stage, Aumann discerns infused contemplation as a separate stage in the fourth mansion of the \"Interior Castle\". Together, these \"five grades are infused prayer and belong to the mystical phase of spiritual life\".\nThomas Merton disagrees on a fine-cut distinction between acquired contemplation and the prayer of quiet, noticing the Carmelite tendency of systematization, whereas Teresa herself was just describing her personal experiences. Commenting on Teresa's writings and the scholarly discussions on the precise stages, Thomas Merton comments: \"with all these divisions and distinctions, comings and goings and varieties of terms, one tends to become impatient with the saint\".\nAumann synthesizes Teresa's writings into nine grades of prayer:\nOrdinary prayer or ascetical stage.\nMental or meditational prayer.\nMental prayer is a form of prayer \"performed without aid of any particular formula.\" It is distinguished from vocal prayers, \"prayers performed by means of a given formula\", Prayer is mental when the thoughts and affections of the soul are not expressed in a previously determined formula. According to Teresa of \u00c1vila, mental prayer is meditational prayer, in which the person is like a gardener, who, with much labour, draws the water up from the depths of the well to water the plants and flowers. According to Teresa of Avila, mental prayer can proceed by using vocal prayers in order to improve dialogue with God. According to Lehodey, mental prayer can be divided into meditation, more active in reflections, and contemplation, more quiet and gazeful.\nNatural or acquired contemplation \u2013 prayer of simplicity.\nFor Teresa of Avila, in natural or acquired contemplation, also called the prayer of simplicity there is one dominant thought or sentiment which recurs constantly and easily (although with little or no development) amid many other thoughts, beneficial or otherwise. The prayer of simplicity often has a tendency to simplify itself even in respect to its object, leading one to think chiefly of God and of his presence, but in a confused manner.\nIn the words of Saint Alphonsus Maria de Liguori, acquired contemplation \"consists in seeing at a simple glance the truths which could previously be discovered only through prolonged discourse\": reasoning is largely replaced by intuition and affections and resolutions, though not absent, are only slightly varied and expressed in a few words. Similarly, Saint Ignatius of Loyola, in his 30-day retreat or Spiritual Exercises beginning in the \"second week\" with its focus on the life of Jesus, describes less reflection and more simple contemplation on the events of Jesus' life. These contemplations consist mainly in a simple gaze and include an \"application of the senses\" to the events, to further one's empathy for Jesus' values, \"to love him more and to follow him more closely\".\nDefinitions similar to that of Saint Alphonsus Maria de Liguori are given by Adolphe Tanquerey (\"a simple gaze on God and divine things proceeding from love and tending thereto\") and Saint Francis de Sales (\"a loving, simple and permanent attentiveness of the mind to divine things\").\nNatural or acquired contemplation has been compared to the attitude of a mother watching over the cradle of her child: she thinks lovingly of the child without reflection and amid interruptions. The \"Catechism of the Catholic Church\" states: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What is contemplative prayer? St. Teresa answers: 'Contemplative [sic] prayer [oraci\u00f3n mental] in my opinion is nothing else than a close sharing between friends; it means taking time frequently to be alone with him who we know loves us.' Contemplative prayer seeks him 'whom my soul loves'. It is Jesus, and in him, the Father. We seek him, because to desire him is always the beginning of love, and we seek him in that pure faith which causes us to be born of him and to live in him. In this inner prayer we can still meditate, but our attention is fixed on the Lord himself.\nInfused or higher contemplation \u2013 mystical union.\nAccording to Hardon, infused contemplation is \"A supernatural gift by which a person's mind and will become totally centered on God. Under this influence the intellect receives special insights into things of the spirit, and the affections are extraordinarily animated with divine love. Infused contemplation assumes the free co-operation of the human will.\" According to Poulain, it is a form of mystical union with God, a union characterized by the fact that it is God, and God only, who manifests Himself. According to Poulain, mystical grace may also manifest as visions of the humanity of Christ or an angel or revelations of a future event, and include miraculous bodily phenomena sometimes observed in ecstatics.\nIn Teresa's mysticism, infused contemplation is described as a \"divinely originated, general, non-conceptual, loving awareness of God\". According to Dubay:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAccording to Thomas Dubay, infused contemplation is the normal, ordinary development of discursive prayer (mental prayer, meditative prayer), which it gradually replaces. Dubay considers infused contemplation as common only among \"those who try to live the whole Gospel wholeheartedly and who engage in an earnest prayer life\". Other writers view contemplative prayer in its infused supernatural form as far from common. John Baptist Scaramelli, reacting in the 17th century against quietism, taught that asceticism and mysticism are two distinct paths to perfection, the former being the normal, ordinary end of the Christian life, and the latter something extraordinary and very rare. Jordan Aumann considered that this idea of the two paths was \"an innovation in spiritual theology and a departure from the traditional Catholic teaching\". And Jacques Maritain proposed that one should not say that every mystic necessarily enjoys habitual infused contemplation in the mystical state, since the gifts of the Holy Spirit are not limited to intellectual operations.\nThe Prayer of Quiet.\nFor Teresa of Avila, the Prayer of Quiet is a state in which the soul experiences an extraordinary peace and rest, accompanied by delight or pleasure in contemplating God as present. According to Poulain, \"Mystical union will be called spiritual quiet when the Divine action is still too weak to prevent distractions: in a word, when the imagination still retains a certain liberty\". According to Poulain, in incomplete mystical union, or the prayer of quiet or supernatural recollection, the action of God is not strong enough to prevent distractions, and the imagination still retains a certain liberty.\nFull or semi-ecstatic union.\nAccording to Poulain, \"Mystical union will be called [...] full union when its strength is so great that the soul is fully occupied with the Divine object, whilst, on the other hand, the senses continue to act (under these conditions, by making a greater or less effort, one can cease from prayer\".\nEcstatic union.\nAccording to Poulain, \"Mystical union will be called [...] ecstasy when communications with the external world are severed or nearly so (in this event one can no longer make voluntary movement nor energy from the state at will).\"\nTransforming union.\nThe transforming union differs from the other three specifically and not merely in intensity. According to Poulain, \"It consists in the habitual consciousness of a mysterious grace which all shall possess in heaven: the anticipation of the Divine nature. The soul is conscious of the Divine assistance in its superior supernatural operations, those of the intellect and the will. Spiritual marriage differs from spiritual espousals inasmuch as the first of these states is permanent and the second only transitory.\"\nPortrayals.\nPortrayals of Teresa include the following:\nPainting, illustration, and sculpture.\nIconography.\nTheresa is usually shown in the habit of the Discalced Carmelites, and writing in a book with a quill pen. Sometimes there is a dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nThis article was originally based on the text in the \"Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It belongs to the halide minerals. It crystallizes in isometric cubic habit, although octahedral and more complex isometric forms are not uncommon.\nThe Mohs scale of mineral hardness, based on scratch hardness comparison, defines value 4 as fluorite.\nPure fluorite is colourless and transparent, both in visible and ultraviolet light, but impurities usually make it a colorful mineral and the stone has ornamental and lapidary uses. Industrially, fluorite is used as a flux for smelting, and in the production of certain glasses and enamels. The purest grades of fluorite are a source of fluoride for hydrofluoric acid manufacture, which is the intermediate source of most fluorine-containing fine chemicals. Optically clear transparent fluorite has anomalous partial dispersion, that is, its refractive index varies with the wavelength of light in a manner that differs from that of commonly used glasses, so fluorite is useful in making apochromatic lenses, and particularly valuable in photographic optics. Fluorite optics are also usable in the far-ultraviolet and mid-infrared ranges, where conventional glasses are too opaque for use. Fluorite also has low dispersion, and a high refractive index for its density.\nHistory and etymology.\nThe word \"fluorite\" is derived from the Latin verb \"fluere\", meaning \"to flow\". The mineral is used as a flux in iron smelting to decrease the viscosity of slag. The term \"flux\" comes from the Latin adjective \"fluxus\", meaning \"flowing, loose, slack\". The mineral fluorite, originally termed fluorspar, was first printed in a 1530 work \"Bermannvs sive de re metallica dialogus\" [Bermannus; or dialogue about the nature of metals], by Georgius Agricola, as a mineral noted for its usefulness as a flux. Agricola, a German scientist with expertise in philology, mining, and metallurgy, named fluorspar as a Neo-Latinization of the German \"Flussspat\" from \"Fluss\" (short for \"Flussmittel\" smelting flux) and \"Spat\" (meaning a nonmetallic mineral akin to gypsum, sp\u00e6rst\u0101n, \"spear stone\", referring to its crystalline projections).\nIn 1852, fluorite gave its name to the phenomenon of fluorescence, which is prominent in fluorites from certain locations, due to certain impurities in the mineral. Fluorite also gave the name to its constitutive element fluorine. Currently, the word \"fluorspar\" is most commonly used for fluorite as an industrial and chemical commodity, while \"fluorite\" is used mineralogically and in most other senses.\nIn archeology, gemmology, classical studies, and Egyptology, the Latin terms \"murrina\" and \"myrrhina\" refer to fluorite. In book 37 of his \"Naturalis Historia\", Pliny the Elder describes it as a precious stone with purple and white mottling, and noted that the Romans prized objects carved from it. It has been suggested that the Sanskrit mineral name \"vaikr\u0101nta\" (\u0935\u0948\u0915\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0903), known from Sanskrit alchemical texts dating from the early second millennium CE onwards, may refer to fluorite.\nStructure.\nFluorite crystallizes in a cubic motif. Crystal twinning is common and adds complexity to the observed crystal habits. Fluorite has four perfect cleavage planes that help produce octahedral fragments. The structural motif adopted by fluorite is so common that the motif is called the fluorite structure. Element substitution for the calcium cation often includes strontium and certain rare-earth elements (REE), such as yttrium and cerium.\nOccurrence and mining.\nFluorite forms as a late-crystallizing mineral in felsic igneous rocks typically through hydrothermal activity. It is particularly common in granitic pegmatites. It may occur as a vein deposit formed through hydrothermal activity particularly in limestones. In such vein deposits it can be associated with galena, sphalerite, barite, quartz, and calcite. Fluorite can also be found as a constituent of sedimentary rocks either as grains or as the cementing material in sandstone.\nIt is a common mineral mainly distributed in South Africa, China, Mexico, Mongolia, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Tanzania, Rwanda and Argentina.\nThe world reserves of fluorite are estimated at 230 million tonnes (Mt) with the largest deposits being in South Africa (about 41 Mt), Mexico (32 Mt) and China (24 Mt). China is leading the world production with about 3 Mt annually (in 2010), followed by Mexico (1.0 Mt), Mongolia (0.45 Mt), Russia (0.22 Mt), South Africa (0.13 Mt), Spain (0.12 Mt) and Namibia (0.11 Mt).\nOne of the largest deposits of fluorspar in North America is located on the Burin Peninsula, Newfoundland, Canada. The first official recognition of fluorspar in the area was recorded by geologist J.B. Jukes in 1843. He noted an occurrence of \"galena\" or lead ore and fluoride of lime on the west side of St. Lawrence harbour. It is recorded that interest in the commercial mining of fluorspar began in 1928 with the first ore being extracted in 1933. Eventually, at Iron Springs Mine, the shafts reached depths of . In the St. Lawrence area, the veins are persistent for great lengths and several of them have wide lenses. The area with veins of known workable size comprises about .\nIn 2018, Canada Fluorspar Inc. commenced mine production again in St. Lawrence; in spring 2019, the company was planned to develop a new shipping port on the west side of Burin Peninsula as a more affordable means of moving their product to markets, and they successfully sent the first shipload of ore from the new port on July 31, 2021. This marks the first time in 30 years that ore has been shipped directly out of St. Lawrence.\nCubic crystals up to 20\u00a0cm across have been found at Dalnegorsk, Russia. The largest documented single crystal of fluorite was a cube 2.12 meters in size and weighing approximately 16 tonnes. \nIn Asturias (Spain) there are several fluorite deposits known internationally for the quality of the specimens they have yielded. In the area of Berbes, Ribadesella, fluorite appears as cubic crystals, sometimes with dodecahedron modifications, which can reach a size of up to 10\u00a0cm of edge, with internal colour zoning, almost always violet in colour. It is associated with quartz and leafy aggregates of baryte. In the \"Emilio\" mine, in Loro\u00f1e, Colunga, the fluorite crystals, cubes with small modifications of other figures, are colourless and transparent. They can reach 10\u00a0cm of edge. In the \"Moscona\" mine, in Villabona, the fluorite crystals, cubic without modifications of other shapes, are yellow, up to 3\u00a0cm of edge. They are associated with large crystals of calcite and barite.\n\"Blue John\".\nOne of the most famous of the older-known localities of fluorite is Castleton in Derbyshire, England, where, under the name of \"Derbyshire Blue John\", purple-blue fluorite was extracted from several mines or caves. During the 19th century, this attractive fluorite was mined for its ornamental value. The mineral Blue John is now scarce, and only a few hundred kilograms are mined each year for ornamental and lapidary use. Mining still takes place in Blue John Cavern and Treak Cliff Cavern.\nRecently discovered deposits in China have produced fluorite with coloring and banding similar to the classic Blue John stone.\nFluorescence.\nGeorge Gabriel Stokes named the phenomenon of \"fluorescence\" from fluorite, in 1852.\nMany samples of fluorite exhibit fluorescence under ultraviolet light, a property that takes its name from fluorite. Many minerals, as well as other substances, fluoresce. Fluorescence involves the elevation of electron energy levels by quanta of ultraviolet light, followed by the progressive falling back of the electrons into their previous energy state, releasing quanta of visible light in the process. In fluorite, the visible light emitted is most commonly blue, but red, purple, yellow, green, and white also occur. The fluorescence of fluorite may be due to mineral impurities, such as yttrium and ytterbium, or organic matter, such as volatile hydrocarbons in the crystal lattice. In particular, the blue fluorescence seen in fluorites from certain parts of Great Britain responsible for the naming of the phenomenon of fluorescence itself, has been attributed to the presence of inclusions of divalent europium in the crystal. Natural samples containing rare earth impurities such as erbium have also been observed to display upconversion fluorescence, in which infrared light stimulates emission of visible light, a phenomenon usually only reported in synthetic materials.\nOne fluorescent variety of fluorite is chlorophane, which is reddish or purple in color and fluoresces brightly in emerald green when heated (thermoluminescence), or when illuminated with ultraviolet light.\nThe color of visible light emitted when a sample of fluorite is fluorescing depends on where the original specimen was collected; different impurities having been included in the crystal lattice in different places. Neither does all fluorite fluoresce equally brightly, even from the same locality. Therefore, ultraviolet light is not a reliable tool for the identification of specimens, nor for quantifying the mineral in mixtures. For example, among British fluorites, those from Northumberland, County Durham, and eastern Cumbria are the most consistently fluorescent, whereas fluorite from Yorkshire, Derbyshire, and Cornwall, if they fluoresce at all, are generally only feebly fluorescent.\nFluorite also exhibits the property of thermoluminescence.\nColor.\nFluorite is allochromatic, meaning that it can be tinted with elemental impurities. Fluorite comes in a wide range of colors and has consequently been dubbed \"the most colorful mineral in the world\". Every color of the rainbow in various shades is represented by fluorite samples, along with white, black, and clear crystals. The most common colors are purple, blue, green, yellow, or colorless. Less common are pink, red, white, brown, and black. Color zoning or banding is commonly present. The color of the fluorite is determined by factors including impurities, exposure to radiation, and the absence of voids of the color centers.\nUses.\nSource of fluorine and fluoride.\nFluorite is a major source of hydrogen fluoride, a commodity chemical used to produce a wide range of materials. Hydrogen fluoride is liberated from the mineral by the action of concentrated sulfuric acid:\nCaF2(s) + H2SO4 \u2192 CaSO4(s) + 2 HF(g)\nThe resulting HF is converted into fluorine, fluorocarbons, and diverse fluoride materials. As of the late 1990s, five billion kilograms were mined annually.\nThere are three principal types of industrial use for natural fluorite, commonly referred to as \"fluorspar\" in these industries, corresponding to different grades of purity. Metallurgical grade fluorite (60\u201385% CaF2), the lowest of the three grades, has traditionally been used as a flux to lower the melting point of raw materials in steel production to aid the removal of impurities, and later in the production of aluminium. Ceramic grade fluorite (85\u201395% CaF2) is used in the manufacture of opalescent glass, enamels, and cooking utensils. The highest grade, \"acid grade fluorite\" (97% or more CaF2), accounts for about 95% of fluorite consumption in the US where it is used to make hydrogen fluoride and hydrofluoric acid by reacting the fluorite with sulfuric acid.\nInternationally, acid-grade fluorite is also used in the production of AlF3 and cryolite (Na3AlF6), which are the main fluorine compounds used in aluminium smelting. Alumina is dissolved in a bath that consists primarily of molten Na3AlF6, AlF3, and fluorite (CaF2) to allow electrolytic recovery of aluminium. Fluorine losses are replaced entirely by the addition of AlF3, the majority of which react with excess sodium from the alumina to form Na3AlF6.\nNiche uses.\nLapidary uses.\nNatural fluorite mineral has ornamental and lapidary uses. Fluorite may be drilled into beads and used in jewelry, although due to its relative softness it is not widely used as a semiprecious stone. It is also used for ornamental carvings, with expert carvings taking advantage of the stone's zonation.\nOptics.\nIn the laboratory, calcium fluoride is commonly used as a window material for both infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths, since it is transparent in these regions (about 150 to 9000\u00a0nm) and exhibits an extremely low change in refractive index with wavelength. Furthermore, the material is attacked by few reagents. At wavelengths as short as 157\u00a0nm, a common wavelength used for semiconductor stepper manufacture for integrated circuit lithography, the refractive index of calcium fluoride shows some non-linearity at high power densities, which has inhibited its use for this purpose. In the early years of the 21st century, the stepper market for calcium fluoride collapsed, and many large manufacturing facilities have been closed. Canon and other manufacturers have used synthetically grown crystals of calcium fluoride components in lenses to aid apochromatic design, and to reduce light dispersion. This use has largely been superseded by newer glasses and computer-aided design. As an infrared optical material, calcium fluoride is widely available and was sometimes known by the Eastman Kodak trademarked name \"Irtran-3\", although this designation is obsolete.\nFluorite should not be confused with fluoro-crown (or fluorine crown) glass, a type of low-dispersion glass that has special optical properties approaching fluorite. True fluorite is not a glass but a crystalline material. Lenses or optical groups made using this low dispersion glass as one or more elements exhibit less chromatic aberration than those utilizing conventional, less expensive crown glass and flint glass elements to make an achromatic lens. Optical groups employ a combination of different types of glass; each type of glass refracts light in a different way. By using combinations of different types of glass, lens manufacturers are able to cancel out or significantly reduce unwanted characteristics; chromatic aberration being the most important. The best of such lens designs are often called apochromatic (see above). Fluoro-crown glass (such as Schott FK51) usually in combination with an appropriate \"flint\" glass (such as Schott KzFSN 2) can give very high performance in telescope objective lenses, as well as microscope objectives, and camera telephoto lenses. Fluorite elements are similarly paired with complementary \"flint\" elements (such as Schott LaK 10). The refractive qualities of fluorite and of certain flint elements provide a lower and more uniform dispersion across the spectrum of visible light, thereby keeping colors focused more closely together. Lenses made with fluorite are superior to fluoro-crown based lenses, at least for doublet telescope objectives; but are more difficult to produce and more costly.\nThe use of fluorite for prisms and lenses was studied and promoted by Victor Schumann near the end of the 19th century. Naturally occurring fluorite crystals without optical defects were only large enough to produce microscope objectives.\nWith the advent of synthetically grown fluorite crystals in the 1950s - 60s, it could be used instead of glass in some high-performance optical telescope and camera lens elements. In telescopes, fluorite elements allow high-resolution images of astronomical objects at high magnifications. Canon Inc. produces synthetic fluorite crystals that are used in their better telephoto lenses. The use of fluorite for telescope lenses has declined since the 1990s, as newer designs using fluoro-crown glass, including triplets, have offered comparable performance at lower prices. Fluorite and various combinations of fluoride compounds can be made into synthetic crystals which have applications in lasers and special optics for UV and infrared.\nExposure tools for the semiconductor industry make use of fluorite optical elements for ultraviolet light at wavelengths of about 157 nanometers. Fluorite has a uniquely high transparency at this wavelength. Fluorite objective lenses are manufactured by the larger microscope firms (Nikon, Olympus, Carl Zeiss and Leica). Their transparency to ultraviolet light enables them to be used for fluorescence microscopy. The fluorite also serves to correct optical aberrations in these lenses. Nikon has previously manufactured at least one fluorite and synthetic quartz element camera lens (105\u00a0mm f/4.5 UV) for the production of ultraviolet images. Konica produced a fluorite lens for their SLR cameras \u2013 the Hexanon 300\u00a0mm f/6.3.\nSource of fluorine gas in nature.\nIn 2012, the first source of naturally occurring fluorine gas was found in fluorite mines in Bavaria, Germany. It was previously thought that fluorine gas did not occur naturally because it is so reactive, and would rapidly react with other chemicals. Fluorite is normally colorless, but some varied forms found nearby look black, and are known as 'fetid fluorite' or antozonite. The minerals, containing small amounts of uranium and its daughter products, release radiation sufficiently energetic to induce oxidation of fluoride anions within the structure, to fluorine that becomes trapped inside the mineral. The color of fetid fluorite is predominantly due to the calcium atoms remaining. Solid-state fluorine-19 NMR carried out on the gas contained in the antozonite, revealed a peak at 425\u00a0ppm, which is consistent with F2.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "43590", "revid": "6941696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43590", "title": "Flux", "text": "Mathematical concept applicable to physics\nFlux describes any effect that appears to pass or travel (whether it actually moves or not) through a surface or substance. Flux is a concept in applied mathematics and vector calculus which has many applications in physics. For transport phenomena, flux is a vector quantity, describing the magnitude and direction of the flow of a substance or property. In vector calculus flux is a scalar quantity, defined as the surface integral of the perpendicular component of a vector field over a surface.\nTerminology.\nThe word \"flux\" comes from Latin: \"fluxus\" means \"flow\", and \"fluere\" is \"to flow\". As \"fluxion\", this term was introduced into differential calculus by Isaac Newton.\nThe concept of heat flux was a key contribution of Joseph Fourier, in the analysis of heat transfer phenomena. His seminal treatise \"Th\u00e9orie analytique de la chaleur\" (\"The Analytical Theory of Heat\"), defines \"fluxion\" as a central quantity and proceeds to derive the now well-known expressions of flux in terms of temperature differences across a slab, and then more generally in terms of temperature gradients or differentials of temperature, across other geometries. One could argue, based on the work of James Clerk Maxwell, that the transport definition precedes the definition of flux used in electromagnetism. The specific quote from Maxwell is:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In the case of fluxes, we have to take the integral, over a surface, of the flux through every element of the surface. The result of this operation is called the surface integral of the flux. It represents the quantity which passes through the surface. \u2014\u200a\nAccording to the transport definition, flux may be a single vector, or it may be a vector field / function of position. In the latter case flux can readily be integrated over a surface. By contrast, according to the electromagnetism definition, flux \"is\" the integral over a surface; it makes no sense to integrate a second-definition flux for one would be integrating over a surface twice. Thus, Maxwell's quote only makes sense if \"flux\" is being used according to the transport definition (and furthermore is a vector field rather than single vector). This is ironic because Maxwell was one of the major developers of what we now call \"electric flux\" and \"magnetic flux\" according to the electromagnetism definition. Their names in accordance with the quote (and transport definition) would be \"surface integral of electric flux\" and \"surface integral of magnetic flux\", in which case \"electric flux\" would instead be defined as \"electric field\" and \"magnetic flux\" defined as \"magnetic field\". This implies that Maxwell conceived of these fields as flows/fluxes of some sort.\nGiven a flux according to the electromagnetism definition, the corresponding flux density, if that term is used, refers to its derivative along the surface that was integrated. By the Fundamental theorem of calculus, the corresponding flux density is a flux according to the transport definition. Given a current such as electric current\u2014charge per time, current density would also be a flux according to the transport definition\u2014charge per time per area. Due to the conflicting definitions of \"flux\", and the interchangeability of \"flux\", \"flow\", and \"current\" in nontechnical English, all of the terms used in this paragraph are sometimes used interchangeably and ambiguously. Concrete fluxes in the rest of this article will be used in accordance to their broad acceptance in the literature, regardless of which definition of flux the term corresponds to.\nFlux as flow rate per unit area.\nIn transport phenomena (heat transfer, mass transfer and fluid dynamics), flux is defined as the \"rate of flow of a property per unit area\", which has the dimensions [quantity]\u00b7[time]\u22121\u00b7[area]\u22121. The area is of the surface the property is flowing \"through\" or \"across\". For example, the amount of water that flows through a cross section of a river each second divided by the area of that cross section, or the amount of sunlight energy that lands on a patch of ground each second divided by the area of the patch, are kinds of flux.\nGeneral mathematical definition (transport).\nHere are 3 definitions in increasing order of complexity. Each is a special case of the following. In all cases the frequent symbol \"j\", (or \"J\") is used for flux, \"q\" for the physical quantity that flows, \"t\" for time, and \"A\" for area. These identifiers will be written in bold when and only when they are vectors.\nFirst, flux as a (single) scalar:\nformula_1\nwhere\nformula_2\nIn this case the surface in which flux is being measured is fixed and has area \"A\". The surface is assumed to be flat, and the flow is assumed to be everywhere constant with respect to position and perpendicular to the surface.\nSecond, flux as a scalar field defined along a surface, i.e. a function of points on the surface:\nformula_3\nformula_4\nAs before, the surface is assumed to be flat, and the flow is assumed to be everywhere perpendicular to it. However the flow need not be constant. \"q\" is now a function of p, a point on the surface, and \"A\", an area. Rather than measure the total flow through the surface, \"q\" measures the flow through the disk with area \"A\" centered at \"p\" along the surface.\nFinally, flux as a vector field:\nformula_5\nformula_6\nIn this case, there is no fixed surface we are measuring over. \"q\" is a function of a point, an area, and a direction (given by a unit vector formula_7), and measures the flow through the disk of area A perpendicular to that unit vector. \"I\" is defined picking the unit vector that maximizes the flow around the point, because the true flow is maximized across the disk that is perpendicular to it. The unit vector thus uniquely maximizes the function when it points in the \"true direction\" of the flow. (Strictly speaking, this is an abuse of notation because the \"arg\u202fmax\" cannot directly compare vectors; we take the vector with the biggest norm instead.)\nProperties.\nThese direct definitions, especially the last, are rather unwieldy . For example, the arg\u202fmax construction is artificial from the perspective of empirical measurements, when with a weathervane or similar one can easily deduce the direction of flux at a point. Rather than defining the vector flux directly, it is often more intuitive to state some properties about it. Furthermore, from these properties the flux can uniquely be determined anyway.\nIf the flux j passes through the area at an angle \u03b8 to the area normal formula_7, then the dot product\nformula_9\nThat is, the component of flux passing through the surface (i.e. normal to it) is \"j\"\u202fcos\u202f\"\u03b8\", while the component of flux passing tangential to the area is \"j\"\u202fsin\u202f\"\u03b8\", but there is \"no\" flux actually passing \"through\" the area in the tangential direction. The \"only\" component of flux passing normal to the area is the cosine component.\nFor vector flux, the surface integral of j over a surface \"S\", gives the proper flowing per unit of time through the surface:\nformula_10\nwhere A (and its infinitesimal) is the vector area\u00a0\u2013 combination formula_11 of the magnitude of the area \"A\" through which the property passes and a unit vector formula_7 normal to the area.\nUnlike in the second set of equations, the surface here need not be flat.\nFinally, we can integrate again over the time duration \"t\"1 to \"t\"2, getting the total amount of the property flowing through the surface in that time (\"t\"2\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\"t\"1):\nformula_13\nTransport fluxes.\nEight of the most common forms of flux from the transport phenomena literature are defined as follows: \nThese fluxes are vectors at each point in space, and have a definite magnitude and direction. Also, one can take the divergence of any of these fluxes to determine the accumulation rate of the quantity in a control volume around a given point in space. For incompressible flow, the divergence of the volume flux is zero.\nChemical diffusion.\nAs mentioned above, chemical molar flux of a component A in an isothermal, isobaric system is defined in Fick's law of diffusion as:\nformula_14\nwhere the nabla symbol \u2207 denotes the gradient operator, \"DAB\" is the diffusion coefficient (m2\u00b7s\u22121) of component A diffusing through component B, \"cA\" is the concentration (mol/m3) of component A.\nThis flux has units of mol\u00b7m\u22122\u00b7s\u22121, and fits Maxwell's original definition of flux.\nFor dilute gases, kinetic molecular theory relates the diffusion coefficient \"D\" to the particle density \"n\" = \"N\"/\"V\", the molecular mass \"m\", the collision cross section formula_15, and the absolute temperature \"T\" by\nformula_16\nwhere the second factor is the mean free path and the square root (with the Boltzmann constant \"k\") is the mean velocity of the particles.\nIn turbulent flows, the transport by eddy motion can be expressed as a grossly increased diffusion coefficient.\nQuantum mechanics.\nIn quantum mechanics, particles of mass \"m\" in the quantum state \"\u03c8\"(r, \"t\") have a probability density defined as\nformula_17\nSo the probability of finding a particle in a differential volume element d3r is\nformula_18\nThen the number of particles passing perpendicularly through unit area of a cross-section per unit time is the probability flux;\nformula_19\nThis is sometimes referred to as the probability current or current density, or probability flux density.\nFlux as a surface integral.\nGeneral mathematical definition (surface integral).\nAs a mathematical concept, flux is represented by the surface integral of a vector field,\nformula_20\nformula_21\nwhere F is a vector field, and dA is the vector area of the surface \"A\", directed as the surface normal. For the second, n is the outward pointed unit normal vector to the surface.\nThe surface has to be orientable, i.e. two sides can be distinguished: the surface does not fold back onto itself. Also, the surface has to be actually oriented, i.e. we use a convention as to flowing which way is counted positive; flowing backward is then counted negative.\nThe surface normal is usually directed by the right-hand rule.\nConversely, one can consider the flux the more fundamental quantity and call the vector field the flux density.\nOften a vector field is drawn by curves (field lines) following the \"flow\"; the magnitude of the vector field is then the line density, and the flux through a surface is the number of lines. Lines originate from areas of positive divergence (sources) and end at areas of negative divergence (sinks).\nSee also the image at right: the number of red arrows passing through a unit area is the flux density, the curve encircling the red arrows denotes the boundary of the surface, and the orientation of the arrows with respect to the surface denotes the sign of the inner product of the vector field with the surface normals.\nIf the surface encloses a 3D region, usually the surface is oriented such that the influx is counted positive; the opposite is the outflux.\nThe divergence theorem states that the net outflux through a closed surface, in other words the net outflux from a 3D region, is found by adding the local net outflow from each point in the region (which is expressed by the divergence).\nIf the surface is not closed, it has an oriented curve as boundary. Stokes' theorem states that the flux of the curl of a vector field is the line integral of the vector field over this boundary. This path integral is also called circulation, especially in fluid dynamics. Thus the curl is the circulation density.\nWe can apply the flux and these theorems to many disciplines in which we see currents, forces, etc., applied through areas.\nElectromagnetism.\nElectric flux.\nAn electric \"charge\", such as a single proton in space, has a magnitude defined in coulombs. Such a charge has an electric field surrounding it. In pictorial form, the electric field from a positive point charge can be visualized as a dot radiating electric field lines (sometimes also called \"lines of force\"). Conceptually, electric flux can be thought of as \"the number of field lines\" passing through a given area. Mathematically, electric flux is the integral of the normal component of the electric field over a given area. Hence, units of electric flux are, in the MKS system, newtons per coulomb times meters squared, or N m2/C. (Electric flux density is the electric flux per unit area, and is a measure of strength of the normal component of the electric field averaged over the area of integration. Its units are N/C, the same as the electric field in MKS units.)\nTwo forms of electric flux are used, one for the E-field:\n formula_22 formula_23 formula_24\nand one for the D-field (called the electric displacement):\n formula_25 formula_23 formula_27\nThis quantity arises in Gauss's law \u2013 which states that the flux of the electric field E out of a closed surface is proportional to the electric charge \"QA\" enclosed in the surface (independent of how that charge is distributed), the integral form is:\n formula_23 formula_29\nwhere \"\u03b5\"0 is the permittivity of free space.\nIf one considers the flux of the electric field vector, E, for a tube near a point charge in the field of the charge but not containing it with sides formed by lines tangent to the field, the flux for the sides is zero and there is an equal and opposite flux at both ends of the tube. This is a consequence of Gauss's law applied to an inverse square field. The flux for any cross-sectional surface of the tube will be the same. The total flux for any surface surrounding a charge \"q\" is \"q\"/\"\u03b5\"0.\nIn free space the electric displacement is given by the constitutive relation D = \"\u03b5\"0 E, so for any bounding surface the D-field flux equals the charge \"QA\" within it. Here the expression \"flux of\" indicates a mathematical operation and, as can be seen, the result is not necessarily a \"flow\", since nothing actually flows along electric field lines.\nMagnetic flux.\nThe magnetic flux density (magnetic field) having the unit Wb/m2 (Tesla) is denoted by B, and magnetic flux is defined analogously:\nformula_30\nwith the same notation above. The quantity arises in Faraday's law of induction, where the magnetic flux is time-dependent either because the boundary is time-dependent or magnetic field is time-dependent. In integral form:\nformula_31\nwhere \"d\"{{ell}} is an infinitesimal vector line element of the closed curve formula_32, with magnitude equal to the length of the infinitesimal line element, and direction given by the tangent to the curve formula_32, with the sign determined by the integration direction.\nThe time-rate of change of the magnetic flux through a loop of wire is minus the electromotive force created in that wire. The direction is such that if current is allowed to pass through the wire, the electromotive force will cause a current which \"opposes\" the change in magnetic field by itself producing a magnetic field opposite to the change. This is the basis for inductors and many electric generators.\nPoynting flux.\nUsing this definition, the flux of the Poynting vector S over a specified surface is the rate at which electromagnetic energy flows through that surface, defined like before:\n {{oiint\nThe flux of the Poynting vector through a surface is the electromagnetic power, or energy per unit time, passing through that surface. This is commonly used in analysis of electromagnetic radiation, but has application to other electromagnetic systems as well.\nConfusingly, the Poynting vector is sometimes called the \"power flux\", which is an example of the first usage of flux, above. It has units of watts per square metre (W/m2)."}

His name was given to the concepts of the Roche sphere, Roche limit, and Roche lobe. He also was the author of works in meteorology.\nBiography.\nHe was born in Montpellier, and studied at the University of Montpellier, receiving his D.Sc. in 1844 and later becoming a professor at the same institution, where he served in the Facult\u00e9 des Sciences starting in 1849. Roche made a mathematical study of Laplace's nebular hypothesis and presented his results in a series of papers to the Academy of Montpellier from his appointment until 1877. The most important were on comets (1860) and the nebular hypothesis itself (1873). Roche's studies examined the effects of strong gravitational fields upon swarms of tiny particles.\nHe is perhaps most famous for his theory that the planetary rings of Saturn were formed when a large icy moon came too close to Saturn and was pulled apart by gravitational forces. He described a method of calculating the distance at which an object held together only by gravity would break up due to tidal forces; this distance became known as the Roche limit.\nHis other best known works also involved orbital mechanics. The Roche sphere describes the limits at which an object which is in orbit around two other objects will be captured by one or the other, and the Roche lobe approximates the gravitational sphere of influence of one astronomical body in the face of perturbations from another heavier body around which it orbits.\nRoche's works were not appreciated during his lifetime.

He named seven moons of Saturn and four moons of Uranus \u2013 the seventh planet, discovered by his father Sir William Herschel. He made many contributions to the science of photography, and investigated colour blindness and the chemical power of ultraviolet rays. His \"Preliminary Discourse\" (1831), which advocated an inductive approach to scientific experiment and theory-building, was an important contribution to the philosophy of science.\nEarly life and work on astronomy.\nHerschel was born in Slough, Buckinghamshire, the son of Mary Baldwin and astronomer Sir William Herschel. He was the nephew of astronomer Caroline Herschel. He studied shortly at Eton College and St John's College, Cambridge, graduating as Senior Wrangler in 1813. It was during his time as an undergraduate that he became friends with the mathematicians Charles Babbage and George Peacock. He left Cambridge in 1816 and started working with his father. He took up astronomy in 1816, building a reflecting telescope with a mirror in diameter, and with a focal length. Between 1821 and 1823 he re-examined, with James South, the double stars catalogued by his father. He was one of the founders of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1820. For his work with his father, he was presented with the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1826 (which he won again in 1836), and with the Lalande Medal of the French Academy of Sciences in 1825, while in 1821 the Royal Society bestowed upon him the Copley Medal for his mathematical contributions to their Transactions. Herschel was made a Knight of the Royal Guelphic Order in 1831, and he served as president of the Royal Astronomical Society three times: 1827\u20131829, 1839\u20131841 and 1847\u20131849.\nHerschel's \"A preliminary discourse on the study of natural philosophy\", published early in 1831 as part of \"Dionysius Lardner's Cabinet cyclop\u00e6dia\", set out methods of scientific investigation with an orderly relationship between observation and theorising. He described nature as being governed by laws which were difficult to discern or to state mathematically, and the highest aim of natural philosophy was understanding these laws through inductive reasoning, finding a single unifying explanation for a phenomenon. This became an authoritative statement with wide influence on science, particularly at the University of Cambridge where it inspired the student Charles Darwin with \"a burning zeal\" to contribute to this work.\nHe was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1854.\nHerschel published a catalogue of his astronomical observations in 1864, as the \"General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters\", a compilation of his own work and that of his father's, expanding on the senior Herschel's \"Catalogue of Nebulae\". A further complementary volume was published posthumously, as the \"General Catalogue of 10,300 Multiple and Double Stars\".\nHerschel correctly considered astigmatism to be due to irregularity of the cornea and theorised that vision could be improved by the application of some animal jelly contained in a capsule of glass against the cornea. His views were published in an article entitled Light in 1828 and the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Metropolitana\" in 1845.\nDiscoveries of Herschel include the galaxies NGC 7, NGC 10, NGC 25, and NGC 28.\nVisit to South Africa.\nHe declined an offer from the Duke of Sussex that they travel to South Africa on a Navy ship.\nHerschel had his own inherited money and he paid \u00a3500 for passage on the S.S. \"Mountstuart Elphinstone\". He, his wife, their three children and his 20 inch telescope departed from Portsmouth on 13 November 1833.\nThe voyage to South Africa was made to catalogue the stars, nebulae, and other objects of the southern skies. This was to be a completion as well as extension of the survey of the northern heavens undertaken initially by his father William Herschel. He arrived in Cape Town on 15 January 1834 and set up a private telescope at Feldhausen (site of present day Grove Primary School) at Claremont, a suburb of Cape Town. Amongst his other observations during this time was that of the return of Comet Halley. Herschel collaborated with Thomas Maclear, the Astronomer Royal at the Cape of Good Hope and the members of the two families became close friends. During this time, he also witnessed the Great Eruption of Eta Carinae (December 1837).\nIn addition to his astronomical work, however, this voyage to a far corner of the British empire also gave Herschel an escape from the pressures under which he found himself in London, where he was one of the most sought-after of all British men of science. While in southern Africa, he engaged in a broad variety of scientific pursuits free from a sense of strong obligations to a larger scientific community. It was, he later recalled, probably the happiest time in his life. A village in the contemporary province of Eastern Cape is named after him.\nHerschel combined his talents with those of his wife, Margaret, and between 1834 and 1838 they produced 131 botanical illustrations of fine quality, showing the Cape flora. Herschel used a camera lucida to obtain accurate outlines of the specimens and left the details to his wife. Even though their portfolio had been intended as a personal record, and despite the lack of floral dissections in the paintings, their accurate rendition makes them more valuable than many contemporary collections. Some 112 of the 132 known flower studies were collected and published as \"Flora Herscheliana\" in 1996. The book also included work by Charles Davidson Bell and Thomas Bowler.\nAs their home during their stay in the Cape, the Herschels had selected 'Feldhausen' (\"Field Houses\"), an old estate on the south-eastern side of Table Mountain. Here John set up his reflector to begin his survey of the southern skies.\nHerschel, at the same time, read widely. Intrigued by the ideas of gradual formation of landscapes set out in Charles Lyell's \"Principles of Geology\", he wrote to Lyell on 20 February 1836 praising the book as a work that would bring \"a complete revolution in [its] subject, by altering entirely the point of view in which it must thenceforward be contemplated\" and opening a way for bold speculation on \"that mystery of mysteries, the replacement of extinct species by others.\" Herschel himself thought catastrophic extinction and renewal \"an inadequate conception of the Creator\" and by analogy with other intermediate causes, \"the origination of fresh species, could it ever come under our cognizance, would be found to be a natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process\". He prefaced his words with the couplet:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTaking a gradualist view of development and referring to evolutionary descent from a proto-language, Herschel commented:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Words are to the Anthropologist what rolled pebbles are to the Geologist \u2013 battered relics of past ages often containing within them indelible records capable of intelligent interpretation \u2013 and when we see what amount of change 2000 years has been able to produce in the languages of Greece &amp; Italy or 1000 in those of Germany France &amp; Spain we naturally begin to ask how long a period must have lapsed since the Chinese, the Hebrew, the Delaware &amp; the Malesass [Malagasy] had a point in common with the German &amp; Italian &amp; each other \u2013 Time! Time! Time! \u2013 we must not impugn the Scripture Chronology, but we \"must\" interpret it in accordance with \"whatever\" shall appear on fair enquiry to be the \"truth\" for there cannot be two truths. And really there is scope enough: for the lives of the Patriarchs may as reasonably be extended to 5000 or 50000 years apiece as the days of Creation to as many thousand millions of years.\nThe document was circulated, and Charles Babbage incorporated extracts in his ninth and unofficial \"Bridgewater Treatise\", which postulated laws set up by a divine programmer. When HMS \"Beagle\" called at Cape Town, Captain Robert FitzRoy and the young naturalist Charles Darwin visited Herschel on 3 June 1836. Later on, Darwin would be influenced by Herschel's writings in developing his theory advanced in \"The Origin of Species\". In the opening lines of that work, Darwin writes that his intent is \"to throw some light on the origin of species \u2013 that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers,\" referring to Herschel. However, Herschel ultimately rejected the theory of natural selection.\nHerschel returned to England in 1838, was created a baronet, of Slough in the County of Buckingham, and published \"Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope\" in 1847. In this publication he proposed the names still used today for the seven then-known satellites of Saturn: Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, Rhea, Titan, and Iapetus. In the same year, Herschel received his second Copley Medal from the Royal Society for this work. A few years later, in 1852, he proposed the names still used today for the four then-known satellites of Uranus: Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. A stone obelisk, erected in 1842 and now in the grounds of The Grove Primary School, marks the site where his 20-ft reflector once stood.\nPhotography.\nHerschel made numerous important contributions to photography. He made improvements in photographic processes, particularly in inventing the cyanotype process, which became known as blueprints, and variations, such as the chrysotype. In 1839, he made a photograph on glass, which still exists, and experimented with some colour reproduction, noting that rays of different parts of the spectrum tended to impart their own colour to a photographic paper. Herschel made experiments using photosensitive emulsions of vegetable juices, called phytotypes, also known as anthotypes, and published his discoveries in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London in 1842. He collaborated in the early 1840s with Henry Collen, portrait painter to Queen Victoria. Herschel originally discovered the platinum process on the basis of the light sensitivity of platinum salts, later developed by William Willis.\nHerschel coined the term \"photography\" in 1839. Herschel was also the first to apply the terms \"negative\" and \"positive\" to photography.\nHerschel discovered sodium thiosulfate to be a solvent of silver halides in 1819, and informed Talbot and Daguerre of his discovery that this \"hyposulphite of soda\" (\"hypo\") could be used as a photographic fixer, to \"fix\" pictures and make them permanent, after experimentally applying it thus in early 1839.\nHerschel's ground-breaking research on the subject was read at the Royal Society in London in March 1839 and January 1840.\nOther aspects of Herschel's career.\nHerschel wrote many papers and articles, including entries on meteorology, physical geography and the telescope for the eighth edition of the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\". He also translated the \"Iliad\" of Homer.\nIn 1823, Herschel published his findings on the optical spectra of metal salts.\nHerschel invented the actinometer in 1825 to measure the direct heating power of the Sun's rays, and his work with the instrument is of great importance in the early history of photochemistry.\nHerschel proposed a correction to the Gregorian calendar, making years that are multiples of 4000 common years rather than leap years, thus reducing the average length of the calendar year from 365.2425 days to 365.24225. Although this is closer to the mean tropical year of 365.24219 days, his proposal has never been adopted because the Gregorian calendar is based on the mean time between vernal equinoxes (currently days).\nHerschel was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1832, and in 1836, a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\nIn 1835, the \"New York Sun\" newspaper wrote a series of satiric articles that came to be known as the Great Moon Hoax, with statements falsely attributed to Herschel about his supposed discoveries of animals living on the Moon, including batlike winged humanoids.\nSeveral locations are named for him: the village of Herschel in western Saskatchewan, Canada, site of the discovery of \"Dolichorhynchops herschelensis\", a type of plesiosaur; Mount Herschel in Antarctica; the crater J. Herschel on the Moon; and the settlement of Herschel, Eastern Cape and the Herschel Girls' School in Cape Town, South Africa.\nWhile it is commonly accepted that Herschel Island, in the Arctic Ocean, part of the Yukon Territory, was named after him, the entries in the expedition journal of Sir John Franklin state that the latter wished to honour the Herschel family, of which John Herschel's father, Sir William Herschel, and his aunt, Caroline Herschel, are as notable as John.\nFamily.\nHerschel married Margaret Brodie Stewart (1810\u20131884) on 3 March 1829 at St. Marlyebone Church in London, and was father of the following children:\nDeath.\nHerschel died on 11 May 1871 at age 79 at Collingwood, his home near Hawkhurst in Kent. On his death, he was given a national funeral and buried in Westminster Abbey.\nHis obituary by Henry W Field of London was read to the American Philosophical Society on 1 December 1871.\nWorks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is commonly used to refer to what happens in practice, in contrast with \"de jure\" ('from law'). This distinction is highly significant in fields like law and governance.\nThe term \"de facto\" is used to describe concepts that have, or could have, both a declared official form as well as an unofficial functioning form. For example, a \"de facto\" government holds power without legal recognition, while a \"de jure\" government may have formal legal authority but lack any real power.\nJurisprudence and \"de facto\" law.\nIn jurisprudence, a de facto\" law (also known as a de facto\" regulation) is a law or regulation that is followed but \"is not specifically enumerated by a law.\" By definition, \"de facto\" 'contrasts' \"de jure\" which means \"as defined by law\" or \"as a matter of law.\" For example, if a particular law exists in one jurisdiction, but is followed in another where it has no legal effect (such as in another country), then the law could be considered a \"de facto\" regulation (a \"\"de facto\" regulation\" is not an officially prescribed legal classification for a \"type of law\" in a particular jurisdiction, rather, it is a concept about law(s).\nA \"de facto\" regulation \"may\" be followed by an organization as a result of the market size of the \"jurisdiction imposing the regulation\" as a proportion of the overall market; wherein the market share is so large that it results in the organization choosing to comply by implementing one standard of business with respect to the given \"de facto\" law instead of altering standards between different jurisdictions and markets (e.g. data protection, manufacturing, etc.). The decision to voluntarily comply \"may\" be the result of: a desire to simplify manufacturing processes &amp; cost-effectiveness (\"such as adopting a one size fits all approach\"), consumer demand &amp; expectation, or other factors known only to the complier.\nIn prison sentences, the term \"de facto\" life sentence (also known as a \"virtual\" life sentence) is used to describe a \"non-life sentence\" that is long enough to end after the convicted person would have likely died due to old age, or one long enough to cause the convicted person to \"live out the vast majority of their life in jail prior to their release.\"\nTechnical standards.\nA de facto standard is a standard (formal or informal) that has achieved a dominant position by tradition, enforcement, or market dominance. It has not necessarily received formal approval by way of a standardization process, and may not have an official standards document.\nTechnical standards are usually voluntary, such as ISO 9000 requirements, but may be obligatory, enforced by government norms, such as drinking water quality requirements. The term \"de facto standard\" is used for both: to contrast obligatory standards (also known as \"de jure standards\"); or to express a dominant standard, when there is more than one proposed standard.\nIn social sciences, a voluntary standard that is also a de facto standard, is a typical solution to a coordination problem.\nGovernment and culture.\nNational languages.\nSeveral countries, including Australia, Japan, Mexico, and the United Kingdom, only have a de facto national language but no official de jure national language, because in these countries there is not any legal document which mentions and regulates the official language. \nSome countries have a de facto national language in addition to an official language. In Morocco, Arabic and Tamazight are both the official languages; in addition, French is a de facto national language. In Lebanon, Arabic is the official language; moreover, English and French is the national language. In New Zealand, the official languages are M\u0101ori and New Zealand Sign Language; however, English is the language which has the highest population and most predominant.\nRussian was the de facto official language of the central government and, to a large extent, republican governments of the former Soviet Union, but was not declared de jure state language until 1990. A short-lived law, effected April 24, 1990, installed Russian as the sole de jure official language of the Union prior to its dissolution in 1991.\nIn Hong Kong and Macau, the special administrative regions of China, the official languages are English and Portuguese respectively, together with Chinese. However, no particular variety of Chinese referred to in law is specified. Cantonese (Hong Kong Cantonese) in traditional Chinese characters is the standard speaking and writing systems in both territories.\nGovernance and sovereignty.\nA de facto government is a government wherein all the attributes of sovereignty have, by usurpation, been transferred from those who had been legally invested with them to others, who, sustained by a power above the forms of law, claim to act and do really act in their stead.\nIn politics, a de facto leader of a country or region is one who has assumed authority, regardless of whether by lawful, constitutional, or legitimate means; very frequently, the term is reserved for those whose power is thought by some faction to be held by unlawful, unconstitutional, or otherwise illegitimate means, often because it had deposed a previous leader or undermined the rule of a current one. \"De facto\" leaders sometimes do not hold a constitutional office and may exercise power informally.\nNot all dictators are de facto rulers. For example, Augusto Pinochet of Chile initially came to power as the chairperson of a military junta, which briefly made him de facto leader of Chile, but he later amended the nation's constitution and made himself president until new elections were called, making him the formal and legal ruler of Chile. Similarly, Saddam Hussein's formal rule of Iraq is often recorded as beginning in 1979, the year he assumed the Presidency of Iraq. However, his de facto rule of the nation began earlier: during his time as vice president; he exercised a great deal of power at the expense of the elderly Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, the de jure president.\nIn Argentina, the successive military coups that overthrew constitutional governments installed de facto governments in 1930\u20131932, 1943\u20131946, 1955\u20131958, 1966\u20131973 and 1976\u20131983, the last of which combined the powers of the presidential office with those of the National Congress. The subsequent legal analysis of the validity of such actions led to the formulation of a doctrine of the de facto governments, a case law (precedential) formulation which essentially said that the actions and decrees of past de facto governments, although not rooted in legal legitimacy when taken, remained binding until and unless such time as they were revoked or repealed de jure by a subsequent legitimate government.\nThat doctrine was nullified by the constitutional reform of 1994. Article 36 states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTwo examples of de facto leaders are Deng Xiaoping of the People's Republic of China and general Manuel Noriega of Panama. Both of these men exercised nearly all control over their respective nations for many years despite not having either legal constitutional office or the legal authority to exercise power. These individuals are today commonly recorded as the \"leaders\" of their respective nations; recording their legal, correct title would not give an accurate assessment of their power. A modern example of a de facto ruler was Ahmed al-Sharaa, who became the de facto leader of Syria until 29 January 2025, when he was appointed president following the fall of the Assad regime. \nAnother example of a de facto ruler is someone who is not the actual ruler but exerts great or total influence over the true ruler, which is quite common in monarchies. Some examples of these de facto rulers are Empress Dowager Cixi of China (for son Tongzhi Emperor and nephew Guangxu Emperor), Prince Alexander Menshikov (for his former lover Empress Catherine I of Russia), Cardinal Richelieu of France (for Louis XIII), Queen Elisabeth Farnese (for her husband, King Philip V) and Queen Maria Carolina (for her husband King Ferdinand IV of Naples and III of Sicily).\nBorders.\nThe de facto boundaries of a country are defined by the area that its government is actually able to enforce its laws in, and to defend against encroachments by other countries that may also claim the same territory de jure. The Durand Line is an example of a de facto boundary. As well as cases of border disputes, de facto boundaries may also arise in relatively unpopulated areas in which the border was never formally established or in which the agreed border was never surveyed and its exact position is unclear. The same concepts may also apply to a boundary between provinces or other subdivisions of a federal state.\nSegregation.\nIn South Africa, although de jure apartheid formally began in 1948, de facto racist policies and practices discriminating against black South Africans, People of Colour, and Indians dated back decades before.\n\"De facto\" racial discrimination and segregation in the United States (outside of the South) until the 1950s and 1960s was simply discrimination that was not segregation by law (de jure). \"Jim Crow laws\", which were enacted in the 1870s, brought legal racial segregation against black Americans residing in the American South. These laws were legally ended in 1964 by the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\"De facto\" state of war.\nMost commonly used to describe large scale conflicts of the 20th century, the phrase de facto state of war refers to a situation where two nations are actively engaging, or are engaged, in aggressive military actions against the other without a formal declaration of war.\nMarriage and domestic partnerships.\nRelationships.\nA domestic partner outside marriage is referred to as a de facto husband or wife by some authorities.\nIn Australia and New Zealand.\nIn Australian law, a de facto relationship is a legally recognized, committed relationship of a couple living together (opposite-sex or same-sex). \"De facto\" unions are defined in the federal Family Law Act 1975. \"De facto\" relationships provide couples who are living together on a genuine domestic basis with many of the same rights and benefits as married couples. Two people can become a de facto couple by entering into a registered relationship (i.e.: civil union or domestic partnership) or by being assessed as such by the Family Court or Federal Circuit Court. Couples who are living together are generally recognised as a de facto union and thus able to claim many of the rights and benefits of a married couple, even if they have not registered or officially documented their relationship, although this may vary by state. It has been noted that it is harder to prove de facto relationship status, particularly in the case of the death of one of the partners.\nIn April 2014, an Australian federal court judge ruled that a heterosexual couple who had a child and lived together for 13 years were not in a de facto relationship and thus the court had no jurisdiction to divide up their property under family law following a request for separation. In his ruling, the judge stated \"de facto relationship(s) may be described as 'marriage like' but it is not a marriage and has significant differences socially, financially and emotionally.\"\nThe above sense of de facto is related to the relationship between common law traditions and formal (statutory, regulatory, civil) law, and common-law marriages. Common law norms for settling disputes in practical situations, often worked out over many generations to establishing precedent, are a core element informing decision making in legal systems around the world. Because its early forms originated in England in the Middle Ages, this is particularly true in Anglo-American legal traditions and in former colonies of the British Empire, while also playing a role in some countries that have mixed systems with significant admixtures of civil law.\nRelationships not recognised outside Australia.\nDue to Australian federalism, de facto partnerships can only be legally recognised whilst the couple lives within a state in Australia. This is because the power to legislate on de facto matters relies on referrals by States to the Commonwealth in accordance with Section 51(xxxvii) of the Australian Constitution, where it states the new federal law can only be applied back within a state. There must be a nexus between the de facto relationship itself and the Australian state.\nIf an Australian de facto couple moves out of a state, they do not take the state with them and the new federal law is tied to the territorial limits of a state. The legal status and rights and obligations of the de facto or unmarried couple would then be recognised by the laws of the country where they are ordinarily resident.\nThis is unlike marriage and \"matrimonial causes\" which are recognised by sections 51(xxi) and (xxii) of the Constitution of Australia and internationally by marriage law and conventions, Hague Convention on Marriages (1978).\nNon-marital relationship contract.\nA de facto relationship is comparable to non-marital relationship contracts (sometimes called \"palimony agreements\") and certain limited forms of domestic partnership, which are found in many jurisdictions throughout the world.\nA de facto Relationship is not comparable to common-law marriage, which is a fully legal marriage that has merely been contracted in an irregular way (including by habit and repute). Only nine U.S. states and the District of Columbia still permit common-law marriage; but common law marriages are otherwise valid and recognised by and in all jurisdictions whose rules of comity mandate the recognition of any marriage that was legally formed in the jurisdiction where it was contracted.\nFamily law \u2013 custody.\n\"De facto\" joint custody is comparable to the joint legal decision-making authority a married couple has over their child(ren) in many jurisdictions (Canada as an example). Upon separation, each parent maintains de facto joint custody, until such time a court order awards custody, either sole or joint.\nBusiness.\nMonopoly.\nA de facto monopoly is a system where many suppliers of a product are allowed but the market is so completely dominated by one that the other players are unable to compete or even survive. The related terms oligopoly and monopsony are similar in meaning and this is the type of situation that antitrust laws are intended to eliminate.\nFinance.\nIn finance, the World Bank has a pertinent definition:\nA \"de facto government\" comes into, or remains in, power by means not provided for in the country's constitution, such as a coup d'\u00e9tat, revolution, usurpation, abrogation or suspension of the constitution.\nIntellectual property.\nIn engineering, &lt;dfn &gt;de facto technology&lt;/dfn&gt; is a system in which the intellectual property and know-how is privately held. Usually only the owner of the technology manufactures the related equipment. Meanwhile, a &lt;dfn &gt;standard technology&lt;/dfn&gt; consists of systems that have been publicly released to a certain degree so that anybody can manufacture equipment supporting the technology. For instance, in cell phone communications, CDMA1X is a de facto technology, while GSM is a standard technology.\nSports.\nExamples of a de facto General Manager in sports include Syd Thrift who acted as the GM of the Baltimore Orioles between 1999 and 2002. Bill Belichick, the former head coach of the New England Patriots in the NFL did not hold the official title of GM, but served as de facto general manager as he had control over drafting and other personnel decisions.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Established in 1830 as the Depot of Charts and Instruments, it is one of the oldest scientific agencies in the United States, and remains the country's leading facility for astronomical and timing data.\nThe observatory is located in Northwest Washington, D.C. at the northwestern end of Embassy Row. It is among the few pre-20th century astronomical observatories located in an urban area. In 1893, in an effort to escape light pollution, it was relocated from Foggy Bottom near the city's center, to its Northwest Washington, D.C. location.\nThe USNO has conducted significant scientific studies throughout its history, including measuring the speed of light, observing solar eclipses, and discovering the moons of Mars. Its achievements include providing data for the first radio time signals, constructing some of the earliest and most accurate telescopes of their kind, and helping develop universal time. The Naval Observatory performs radio VLBI-based positions of quasars for astrometry and geodesy with numerous global collaborators (IERS), in order to produce Earth orientation parameters and to realize the celestial reference system (ICRF).\nAside from its scientific mission, since the 1970s the Naval Observatory campus hosts the official residence of the vice president of the United States.\nHistory.\nPresident John Quincy Adams, who in 1825 signed the bill for the creation of a national observatory just before leaving presidential office, had intended for it to be called the National Observatory.\nThe names \"National Observatory\" and \"Naval Observatory\" were both used for 10\u00a0years, until the Secretary of the Navy officially adopted the latter.\nAdams had made protracted efforts to bring astronomy to a national level. He spent many nights at the observatory, watching and charting the stars, which had always been one of his interests.\nEstablished by order of the United States Secretary of the Navy John Branch on 6\u00a0December 1830 as the Depot of Charts and Instruments, the Observatory rose from humble beginnings: Placed under the command of Lieutenant Louis M. Goldsborough, with an annual budget of $330; its primary function was the restoration, repair, and rating of navigational instruments.\nOld Naval Observatory.\nIt was established as a national observatory in 1842 by federal law and a Congressional appropriation of $25,000. Lt.\u00a0J.M. Gilliss was put in charge of \"obtaining the instruments needed and books.\" Lt.\u00a0Gilliss visited the principal observatories of Europe with the mission to purchase telescopes and other scientific devices, and books.\nThe observatory's primary mission was to care for the United States Navy's marine chronometers, charts, and other navigational equipment. It calibrated ships' chronometers by timing the transit of stars across the meridian. It opened in 1844 in Foggy Bottom, north of the site of the Lincoln Memorial and west of the White House.\nIn 1893, the observatory moved to its current location in Northwest Washington, D.C. located on a 2000\u00a0foot circle of land atop \"Observatory Hill\", overlooking Massachusetts Avenue.\nIn 2017, the facilities were listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nThe time ball.\nThe first superintendent was Navy Commander M.F. Maury. Maury had the world's first vulcanized time ball, created to his specifications by Charles Goodyear for the U.S.\u00a0Observatory. Placed into service in 1845, it was the first time ball in the United States and the 12th in the world. Maury kept accurate time by the stars and planets.\nThe time ball was dropped every day except Sunday, precisely at the astronomically defined moment of mean solar noon; this enabled all ships and civilians within sight to know the exact time. By the end of the American Civil War, the Observatory's clocks were linked via telegraph to ring the alarm bells in all of the Washington, D.C. firehouses three times a day.\nThe USNO held a one-off time-ball re-enactment for the year-2000 celebration.\nNautical Almanac Office.\nIn 1849, the Nautical Almanac Office (NAO) was established in Cambridge, Massachusetts as a separate organization. In 1866, it was moved to Washington, D.C., operating near Fort Myer. It relocated to the U.S. Naval Observatory grounds in 1893.\nOn 20\u00a0September 1894, the NAO became a \"branch\" of USNO; however, it remained autonomous for several years.\nThe site houses the largest astronomy library in the United States (and the largest astrophysical periodicals collection in the world). The library includes a large collection of rare physics and astronomy books from the past millennium.\nMeasuring the astronomical unit.\nAn early scientific duty assigned to the Observatory was the U.S. contribution to the definition of the Astronomical Unit, or the AU, which defines a standard mean distance between the Sun and the Earth. This was conducted under the auspices of the congressionally-funded U.S. Transit of Venus Commission. The astronomical measurements taken of the transit of Venus by a number of countries since 1639 resulted in a progressively more accurate definition of the AU.\nRelying strongly on photographic methods, the naval observers returned 350\u00a0photographic plates in 1874, and 1,380\u00a0measurable plates in 1882. The results of the surveys conducted simultaneously from several locations around the world (for each of the two transits) produced a final value of the solar parallax, after adjustments, of 8.809\u2033, with a probable error of 0.0059\u2033, yielding a U.S.-determined Earth-Sun distance of , with a probable error of . The calculated distance was a significant improvement over several previous estimates.\nThe 26\u00a0inch refractor and 40\u00a0inch reflector.\nThe telescope used for the discovery of the Moons of Mars was the 26\u00a0inch (66\u00a0cm) refractor telescope, then located at Foggy Bottom, Washington, DC. In 1893 it was moved to its Northwest DC location.\nIn 1934, the largest optical telescope installed at USNO saw \"first light\". This 40\u00a0inch aperture instrument was also the second (and final) telescope made by famed optician, George Willis Ritchey. The Ritchey\u2013Chr\u00e9tien telescope design has since become the \"de\u00a0facto\" optical design for nearly all major telescopes, including the famed Keck telescopes and the space-borne Hubble Space Telescope.\nBecause of light pollution in the Washington metropolitan area, USNO relocated the 40\u00a0inch telescope to Flagstaff, Arizona. A new Navy command, now called the USNO Flagstaff Station (NOFS), was established there. Those operations began in 1955. Within a decade, the Navy's largest telescope, the 61\u00a0inch \"Kaj Strand Astrometric Reflector\" was built; it saw light at Flagstaff in 1964.\nUSNO continues to maintain its dark-sky observatory, NOFS, near Flagstaff. This facility now oversees the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer.\nHistory of the time service.\nBy the early 1870s the USNO daily noon-time signal was distributed electrically, nationwide, via the Western Union Telegraph Company. Time was also \"sold\" to the railroads and was used in conjunction with railroad chronometers to schedule American rail transport. Early in the 20th\u00a0century, the service was broadcast by radio, with Arlington time signal available to those with wireless receivers.\nIn November\u00a01913 the Paris Observatory, using the Eiffel Tower as an antenna, exchanged sustained wireless (radio) signals with the U.S.\u00a0Naval Observatory to determine the exact difference of longitude between the two institutions, via an antenna in Arlington, Virginia.\nThe U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington continues to be a major authority in the areas of Precise Time and Time Interval, Earth orientation, astrometry, and celestial observation. In collaboration with many national and international scientific establishments, it determines the timing and astronomical data required for accurate navigation, astrometry, and fundamental astronomy, and calculation methods \u2014 and distributes this information (such as star catalogs) on-line and in the annual publications \"The Astronomical Almanac\" and \"The Nautical Almanac\".\nFormer USNO director Gernot M. R. Winkler initiated the \"Master clock\" service that the USNO still operates, and which provides precise time to the GPS satellite constellation run by the United States Space Force. The alternate Master Clock time service continues to operate at Schriever Space Force Base in Colorado.\nDepartments.\nIn 1990 two departments were established: Orbital Mechanics and Astronomical Applications, with the Nautical Almanac Office a division in Astronomical Applications. The Orbital Mechanics Department operated under P. Kenneth Seidelmann until 1994, when the department was abolished and its functions transferred to a group within the Astronomical Applications Department.\nIn 2010, USNO's astronomical 'department' known as the Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station (NOFS) was officially made autonomous as an Echelon\u00a05 command, separate from, but still reporting to the USNO in Washington. In the alpine woodlands above 7,000\u00a0feet altitude outside Flagstaff, Arizona, NOFS performs its national, Celestial Reference Frame (CRF) mission under dark skies in that region.\nOfficial residence of the vice president of the United States.\nA house situated on the grounds of the observatory, at Number One Observatory Circle, has been the official residence of the vice president of the United States since 1974. It is protected by tight security control enforced by the Secret Service. The house is separated from the Naval Observatory.\nBefore serving as the vice president's residence, it was that of the observatory's superintendent, and later the chief of naval operations.\nTime service.\nThe U.S. Naval Observatory operates two \"Master Clock\" facilities, one in Washington, DC, and the other at Schriever SFB near Colorado Springs, CO.\nThe observatory also operates four rubidium atomic fountain clocks, which have a stability reaching 7\u00d710-16. The observatory plans to build several more of this type for use at its two facilities.\nThe clocks used for the USNO timescale are kept in 19\u00a0environmental chambers, whose temperatures are kept constant to within 0.1\u00b0C. The relative humidities are kept constant in all maser, and most cesiums enclosures, to within 1%. Time-scale management only uses the clocks in Washington, DC, and of those, preferentially uses the clocks that currently conform reliably to the time reports of the majority. It is the combined 'vote' of the ensemble that constitutes the otherwise-fictitious \"Master Clock\". The time-scale computations on 7\u00a0June 2007 weighted 70 of the clocks into the standard.\nThe U.S. Naval Observatory provides public time service via 26\u00a0NTP servers on the public Internet, and via telephone voice announcements:\nThe voice of actor Fred Covington (1928\u20131993) has been announcing the USNO time since 1978.\nThe voice announcements always begin with the local time (daylight or standard), and include a background of 1\u00a0second ticks. Local time announcements are made on the minute, and 15, 30, and 45\u00a0seconds after the minute. Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is announced 5\u00a0seconds after the local time. Upon connecting, only the second-marking ticks are heard for the few seconds before the next scheduled local time announcement. \nThe USNO also operates a modem time service, and provides time to the Global Positioning System.\nInstrument shop.\nThe United States Naval Observatory Instrument shop has been designing and manufacturing precise instrumentation since the early 1900s.\nSee also.\nAstronomy and observatories\nTechnology and technical resources\nUSNO personnel\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is an electrically neutral quasiparticle regarded as an elementary excitation primarily in condensed matter, such as insulators, semiconductors, some metals, and in some liquids. It transports energy without transporting net electric charge.\nAn exciton can form when an electron from the valence band of a crystal is promoted in energy to the conduction band, for instance when a material absorbs a photon. Promoting the electron to the conduction band leaves a positively charged hole in the valence band. Here 'hole' represents the unoccupied quantum mechanical electron state with a positive charge, an analogue in crystal of a positron. Because of the attractive Coulomb force between the electron and the hole, a bound state is formed, akin to that of the electron and proton in a hydrogen atom or the electron and positron in positronium. Excitons are composite bosons since they are formed from two fermions which are the electron and the hole.\nOccurrences.\nExcitons are often treated in two limiting cases, namely small-radius excitons, named \"Frenkel exciton\", and large-radius excitons, often called \"Wannier-Mott excitons\".\nA Frenkel exciton occurs when the distance between electron and hole is restricted to one or only a few nearest neighbour unit cells. Frenkel excitons typically occur in insulators and organic semiconductors with relatively narrow allowed energy bands and accordingly, rather heavy effective mass.\nIn the case of Wannier-Mott excitons, the relative motion of electron and hole in the crystal covers many unit cells. Wannier-Mott excitons are considered as hydrogen-like quasiparticles. The wavefunction of the bound state then is said to be hydrogenic, resulting in a series of energy states in analogy to a hydrogen atom. Compared to a hydrogen atom, the exciton binding energy in a crystal is much smaller and the exciton's size (radius) is much larger. This is mainly because of two effects: (a) Coulomb forces are screened in a crystal, which is expressed as a relative permittivity \u03b5r significantly larger than 1 and (b) the effective mass of the electron and hole in a crystal are typically smaller compared to that of free electrons. Wannier-Mott excitons with binding energies ranging from a few to hundreds of meV, depending on the crystal, occur in many semiconductors including Cu2O, GaAs, other III-V and II-VI semiconductors, transition metal dichalcogenides such as MoS2. \nExcitons give rise to spectrally narrow lines in optical absorption, reflection, transmission and luminescence spectra with the energies below the free-particle band gap of an insulator or a semiconductor. Exciton binding energy and radius can be extracted from optical absorption measurements in applied magnetic fields.\nThe exciton as a quasiparticle is characterized by the momentum (or wavevector K) describing free propagation of the electron-hole pair as a composite particle in the crystalline lattice in agreement with the Bloch theorem. The exciton energy depends on K and is typically parabolic for the wavevectors much smaller than the reciprocal lattice vector of the host lattice. The exciton energy also depends on the respective orientation of the electron and hole spins, whether they are parallel or anti-parallel. The spins are coupled by the exchange interaction, giving rise to exciton energy fine structure.\nIn metals and highly doped semiconductors a concept of the Gerald Mahan exciton is invoked where the hole in a valence band is correlated with the Fermi sea of conduction electrons. In that case no bound state in a strict sense is formed, but the Coulomb interaction leads to a significant enhancement of absorption in the vicinity of the fundamental absorption edge also known as the Mahan or Fermi-edge singularity.\nHistory.\nThe concept of excitons was first proposed by Yakov Frenkel in 1931, when he described the excitation of an atomic lattice considering what is now called the tight-binding description of the band structure. In his model the electron and the hole bound by the coulomb interaction are located either on the same or on the nearest neighbouring sites of the lattice, but the exciton as a composite quasi-particle is able to travel through the lattice without any net transfer of charge, which led to many propositions for optoelectronic devices.\nTypes.\nFrenkel exciton.\nIn materials with a relatively small dielectric constant, the Coulomb interaction between an electron and a hole may be strong and the excitons thus tend to be small, of the same order as the size of the unit cell. Molecular excitons may even be entirely located on the same molecule, as in fullerenes. This \"Frenkel exciton\", named after Yakov Frenkel, has a typical binding energy on the order of 0.1 to 1 eV. Frenkel excitons are typically found in alkali halide crystals and in organic molecular crystals composed of aromatic molecules, such as anthracene and tetracene. Another example of Frenkel exciton includes on-site \"d\"-\"d\" excitations in transition metal compounds with partially filled \"d\"-shells. While \"d\"-\"d\" transitions are in principle forbidden by symmetry, they become weakly-allowed in a crystal when the symmetry is broken by structural relaxations or other effects. Absorption of a photon resonant with a \"d\"-\"d\" transition leads to the creation of an electron-hole pair on a single atomic site, which can be treated as a Frenkel exciton.\nWannier\u2013Mott exciton.\nIn semiconductors, the dielectric constant is generally large. Consequently, electric field screening tends to reduce the Coulomb interaction between electrons and holes. The result is a \"Wannier\u2013Mott exciton\", which has a radius larger than the lattice spacing. Small effective mass of electrons that is typical of semiconductors also favors large exciton radii. As a result, the effect of the lattice potential can be incorporated into the effective masses of the electron and hole. Likewise, because of the lower masses and the screened Coulomb interaction, the binding energy is usually much less than that of a hydrogen atom, typically on the order of . This type of exciton was named for Gregory Wannier and Nevill Francis Mott. Wannier\u2013Mott excitons are typically found in semiconductor crystals with small energy gaps and high dielectric constants, but have also been identified in liquids, such as liquid xenon. They are also known as \"large excitons\".\nIn single-wall carbon nanotubes, excitons have both Wannier\u2013Mott and Frenkel character. This is due to the nature of the Coulomb interaction between electrons and holes in one-dimension. The dielectric function of the nanotube itself is large enough to allow for the spatial extent of the wave function to extend over a few to several nanometers along the tube axis, while poor screening in the vacuum or dielectric environment outside of the nanotube allows for large (0.4 to ) binding energies.\nOften more than one band can be chosen as source for the electron and the hole, leading to different types of excitons in the same material. Even high-lying bands can be effective as femtosecond two-photon experiments have shown. At cryogenic temperatures, many higher excitonic levels can be observed approaching the edge of the band, forming a series of spectral absorption lines that are in principle similar to hydrogen spectral series.\n3D semiconductors.\nIn a bulk semiconductor, a Wannier exciton has an energy and radius associated with it, called exciton Rydberg energy and exciton Bohr radius respectively. For the energy, we have\nformula_1\nwhere formula_2 is the Rydberg unit of energy (cf. Rydberg constant), formula_3 is the (static) relative permittivity, formula_4 is the reduced mass of the electron and hole, and formula_5 is the electron mass. Concerning the radius, we have\nformula_6\nwhere formula_7 is the Bohr radius.\nFor example, in GaAs, we have relative permittivity of 12.8 and effective electron and hole masses as 0.067\"m0\" and 0.2\"m0\" respectively; and that gives us formula_8 meV and formula_9 nm.\n2D semiconductors.\nIn two-dimensional (2D) materials, the system is quantum confined in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the material. The reduced dimensionality of the system has an effect on the binding energies and radii of Wannier excitons. In fact, excitonic effects are enhanced in such systems.\nFor a simple screened Coulomb potential, the binding energies take the form of the 2D hydrogen atom\nformula_10.\nIn most 2D semiconductors, the Rytova\u2013Keldysh form is a more accurate approximation to the exciton interaction\nformula_11\nwhere formula_12 is the so-called screening length, formula_13 is the vacuum permittivity, formula_14 is the elementary charge, formula_15 the average dielectric constant of the surrounding media, and formula_16 the exciton radius. For this potential, no general expression for the exciton energies may be found. One must instead turn to numerical procedures, and it is precisely this potential that gives rise to the nonhydrogenic Rydberg series of the energies in 2D semiconductors.\nExample: excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs).\nMonolayers of a transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) are a good and cutting-edge example where excitons play a major role. In particular, in these systems, they exhibit a bounding energy of the order of 0.5 eV with a Coulomb attraction between the hole and the electrons stronger than in other traditional quantum wells. As a result, optical excitonic peaks are present in these materials even at room temperatures.\n0D semiconductors.\nIn nanoparticles which exhibit quantum confinement effects and hence behave as quantum dots (also called 0-dimensional semiconductors), excitonic radii are given by\nformula_17\nwhere formula_3 is the relative permittivity, formula_19 is the reduced mass of the electron-hole system, formula_5 is the electron mass, and formula_21 is the Bohr radius.\nHubbard exciton.\nHubbard excitons are linked to electrons not by a Coulomb's interaction, but by a magnetic force. Their name derives by the English physicist John Hubbard.\nHubbard excitons were observed for the first time in 2023 through the Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. Those particles have been obtained by applying a light to a Mott antiferromagnetic insulator.\nCharge-transfer exciton.\nAn intermediate case between Frenkel and Wannier excitons is the \"charge-transfer (CT) exciton\". In molecular physics, CT excitons form when the electron and the hole occupy adjacent molecules. They occur primarily in organic and molecular crystals; in this case, unlike Frenkel and Wannier excitons, CT excitons display a static electric dipole moment. CT excitons can also occur in transition metal oxides, where they involve an electron in the transition metal 3\"d\" orbitals and a hole in the oxygen 2\"p\" orbitals. Notable examples include the lowest-energy excitons in correlated cuprates or the two-dimensional exciton of TiO2. Irrespective of the origin, the concept of CT exciton is always related to a transfer of charge from one atomic site to another, thus spreading the wave-function over a few lattice sites.\nSurface exciton.\nAt surfaces it is possible for so called \"image states\" to occur, where the hole is inside the solid and the electron is in the vacuum. These electron-hole pairs can only move along the surface.\nDark exciton.\nDark excitons are those that cannot be directly excited by light. There are several reasons for exciton \"darkness\". One of them is the case where the electrons have a different momentum from the holes to which they are bound that is they are in an optically forbidden transition which prevents them from photon absorption and therefore to reach their state they need phonon scattering. They can even outnumber normal bright excitons formed by absorption alone. The first direct measurement of the dynamics of momentum-forbidden dark excitons have been performed using time-resolved photoemission from monolayer WS2. A scheme by researcher at the University of Innsbruck enables an all-optical control of dark excitons without relying on any preceding decays.\nAtomic and molecular excitons.\nAlternatively, an exciton may be described as an excited state of an atom, ion, or molecule, if the excitation is wandering from one cell of the lattice to another.\nWhen a molecule absorbs a quantum of energy that corresponds to a transition from one molecular orbital to another molecular orbital, the resulting electronic excited state is also properly described as an exciton. An electron is said to be found in the lowest unoccupied orbital and an electron hole in the highest occupied molecular orbital, and since they are found within the same molecular orbital manifold, the electron-hole state is said to be bound. Molecular excitons typically have characteristic lifetimes on the order of nanoseconds, after which the ground electronic state is restored and the molecule undergoes photon or phonon emission. Molecular excitons have several interesting properties, one of which is energy transfer (see F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer) whereby if a molecular exciton has proper energetic matching to a second molecule's spectral absorbance, then an exciton may transfer (\"hop\") from one molecule to another. The process is strongly dependent on intermolecular distance between the species in solution, and so the process has found application in sensing and \"molecular rulers\".\nThe hallmark of molecular excitons in organic molecular crystals are doublets and/or triplets of exciton absorption bands strongly polarized along crystallographic axes. In these crystals an elementary cell includes several molecules sitting in symmetrically identical positions, which results in the level degeneracy that is lifted by intermolecular interaction. As a result, absorption bands are polarized along the symmetry axes of the crystal. Such multiplets were discovered by Antonina Prikhot'ko and their genesis was proposed by Alexander Davydov. It is known as 'Davydov splitting'.\nGiant oscillator strength of bound excitons.\nExcitons are lowest excited states of the electronic subsystem of pure crystals. Impurities can bind excitons, and when the bound state is shallow, the oscillator strength for producing bound excitons is so high that impurity absorption can compete with intrinsic exciton absorption even at rather low impurity concentrations. This phenomenon is generic and applicable both to the large radius (Wannier\u2013Mott) excitons and molecular (Frenkel) excitons. Hence, excitons bound to impurities and defects possess giant oscillator strength.\nSelf-trapping of excitons.\nIn crystals, excitons interact with phonons, the lattice vibrations. If this coupling is weak as in typical semiconductors such as GaAs or Si, excitons are scattered by phonons. However, when the coupling is strong, excitons can be self-trapped. Self-trapping results in dressing excitons with a dense cloud of virtual phonons which strongly suppresses the ability of excitons to move across the crystal. In simpler terms, this means a local deformation of the crystal lattice around the exciton. Self-trapping can be achieved only if the energy of this deformation can compete with the width of the exciton band. Hence, it should be of atomic scale, of about an electron volt.\nSelf-trapping of excitons is similar to forming strong-coupling polarons but with three essential differences. First, self-trapped exciton states are always of a small radius, of the order of lattice constant, due to their electric neutrality. Second, there exists a self-trapping barrier separating free and self-trapped states, hence, free excitons are metastable. Third, this barrier enables coexistence of free and self-trapped states of excitons. This means that spectral lines of free excitons and wide bands of self-trapped excitons can be seen simultaneously in absorption and luminescence spectra. While the self-trapped states are of lattice-spacing scale, the barrier has typically much larger scale. Indeed, its spatial scale is about formula_22 where formula_23 is effective mass of the exciton, formula_24 is the exciton-phonon coupling constant, and formula_25 is the characteristic frequency of optical phonons. Excitons are self-trapped when formula_23 and formula_24 are large, and then the spatial size of the barrier is large compared with the lattice spacing. Transforming a free exciton state into a self-trapped one proceeds as a collective tunneling of coupled exciton-lattice system (an instanton). Because formula_28 is large, tunneling can be described by a continuum theory. The height of the barrier formula_29. Because both formula_23 and formula_24 appear in the denominator of formula_32, the barriers are basically low. Therefore, free excitons can be seen in crystals with strong exciton-phonon coupling only in pure samples and at low temperatures. Coexistence of free and self-trapped excitons was observed in rare-gas solids, alkali-halides, and in molecular crystal of pyrene.\nInteraction.\nExcitons are the main mechanism for light emission in semiconductors at low temperature (when the characteristic thermal energy \"kT\" is less than the exciton binding energy), replacing the free electron-hole recombination at higher temperatures.\nThe existence of exciton states may be inferred from the absorption of light associated with their excitation. Typically, excitons are observed just below the band gap.\nWhen excitons interact with photons a so-called polariton (or more specifically exciton-polariton) is formed. These excitons are sometimes referred to as \"dressed excitons\".\nProvided the interaction is attractive, an exciton can bind with other excitons to form a biexciton, analogous to a dihydrogen molecule. If a large density of excitons is created in a material, they can interact with one another to form an electron-hole liquid, a state observed in k-space indirect semiconductors.\nAdditionally, excitons are integer-spin particles obeying Bose statistics in the low-density limit. In some systems, where the interactions are repulsive, a Bose\u2013Einstein condensed state, called excitonium, is predicted to be the ground state. Some evidence of excitonium has existed since the 1970s but has often been difficult to discern from a Peierls phase. Exciton condensates have allegedly been seen in a double quantum well systems. In 2017 Kogar et al. found \"compelling evidence\" for observed excitons condensing in the three-dimensional semimetal 1\"T\"-TiSe2.\nSpatially direct and indirect excitons.\nNormally, excitons in a semiconductor have a very short lifetime due to the close proximity of the electron and hole. However, by placing the electron and hole in spatially separated quantum wells with an insulating barrier layer in between so called 'spatially indirect' excitons can be created. This can be achieved using transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures. In contrast to ordinary (spatially direct), these spatially indirect excitons can have large spatial separation between the electron and hole, and thus possess a much longer lifetime. This is often used to cool excitons to very low temperatures in order to study Bose\u2013Einstein condensation (or rather its two-dimensional analog).\nFractional excitons.\nFractional excitons are a class of quantum particles discovered in bilayer graphene systems under the fractional quantum Hall effect. These excitons form when electrons and holes bind in a two-dimensional material separated by an insulating layer of hexagonal boron nitride. When exposed to strong magnetic fields, these systems display fractionalized excitonic behavior with distinct quantum properties.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are the glacial equivalent of rias, or drowned river valleys. Fjords exist on the coasts of Antarctica, the Arctic, and surrounding landmasses of the northern and southern hemispheres. Areas with extensive fjords demonstrate an extreme example of the coastline paradox; Norway's coastline is estimated to be long with its nearly 1,200 fjords, but only long when excluding the fjords.\nFormation.\nA true fjord is formed when a glacier cuts a U-shaped valley by ice segregation and abrasion of the surrounding bedrock. According to the standard model, glaciers formed in pre-glacial valleys with a gently sloping valley floor. The work of the glacier then left an overdeepened U-shaped valley that ends abruptly at a valley or trough end. Such valleys are fjords when flooded by the ocean. Thresholds above sea level create freshwater lakes. Glacial melting is accompanied by the rebounding of Earth's crust as the ice load and eroded sediment is removed (also called isostasy or glacial rebound). In some cases, this rebound is faster than sea level rise. Most fjords are deeper than the adjacent sea; Sognefjord, Norway, reaches as much as below sea level. Fjords generally have a sill or shoal (bedrock) at their mouth caused by the previous glacier's reduced erosion rate and terminal moraine. In many cases this sill causes extreme currents and large saltwater rapids (see skookumchuck). Saltstraumen in Norway is often described as the world's strongest tidal current. These characteristics distinguish fjords from rias (such as the Bay of Kotor), which are drowned valleys flooded by the rising sea. Drammensfjorden is cut almost in two by the Svelvik \"ridge\", a sandy moraine that was below sea level when it was covered by ice, but after the post-glacial rebound reaches above the fjord.\nIn the 19th century, Jens Esmark introduced the theory that fjords are or have been created by glaciers and that large parts of Northern Europe had been covered by thick ice in prehistory. Thresholds at the mouths and overdeepening of fjords compared to the ocean are the strongest evidence of glacial origin, and these thresholds are mostly rocky. Thresholds are related to sounds and low land where the ice could spread out and therefore have less erosive force. John Walter Gregory argued that fjords are of tectonic origin and that glaciers had a negligible role in their formation. Gregory's views were rejected by subsequent research and publications. In the case of Hardangerfjord the fractures of the Caledonian fold has guided the erosion by glaciers, while there is no clear relation between the direction of Sognefjord and the fold pattern. This relationship between fractures and direction of fjords is also observed in Lyngen. Preglacial, Tertiary rivers presumably eroded the surface and created valleys that later guided the glacial flow and erosion of the bedrock. This may in particular have been the case in Western Norway where the tertiary uplift of the landmass amplified eroding forces of rivers.\nConfluence of tributary fjords led to excavation of the deepest fjord basins. Near the very coast, the typical West Norwegian glacier spread out (presumably through sounds and low valleys) and lost their concentration and reduced the glaciers' power to erode leaving bedrock thresholds. Bolstadfjorden is deep with a threshold of only , while the deep Sognefjorden has a threshold around deep. Hardangerfjord is made up of several basins separated by thresholds: The deepest basin Samlafjorden between Jonaneset (Jondal) and \u00c5lvik with a distinct threshold at Vikingneset in Kvam Municipality.\nHanging valleys are common along glaciated fjords and U-shaped valleys. A hanging valley is a tributary valley that is higher than the main valley and was created by tributary glacier flows into a glacier of larger volume. The shallower valley appears to be 'hanging' above the main valley or a fjord. Often, waterfalls form at or near the outlet of the upper valley. Small waterfalls within these fjords are also used as freshwater resources. Hanging valleys also occur underwater in fjord systems. The branches of Sognefjord are for instance much shallower than the main fjord. The mouth of Fj\u00e6rlandsfjord is about deep while the main fjord is nearby. The mouth of Ikjefjord is only deep while the main fjord is around at the same point.\nFeatures and variations.\nHydrology.\nDuring the winter season, there is usually little inflow of water that is fresh. Surface water and deeper water (down to or more) are mixed during winter because of the steady cooling of the surface and wind. In the deep fjords, there is still fresh water from the summer with less density than the saltier water along the coast. Offshore wind, common in the fjord areas during winter, sets up a current on the surface from the inner to the outer parts. This current on the surface in turn pulls dense salt water from the coast across the fjord threshold and into the deepest parts of the fjord. Bolstadfjorden has a threshold of only and strong inflow of freshwater from Vosso river creates a brackish surface that blocks circulation of the deep fjord. The deeper, salt layers of Bolstadfjorden are deprived of oxygen and the seabed is covered with organic material. The shallow threshold also creates a strong tidal current.\nDuring the summer season, there is usually a large inflow of river water in the inner areas. This freshwater gets mixed with saltwater creating a layer of brackish water with a slightly higher surface than the ocean which in turn sets up a current from the river mouths towards the ocean. This current is gradually more salty towards the coast and right under the surface current there is a reverse current of saltier water from the coast. In the deeper parts of the fjord the cold water remaining from winter is still and separated from the atmosphere by the brackish top layer. This deep water is ventilated by mixing with the upper layer causing it to warm and freshen over the summer. In fjords with a shallow threshold or low levels of mixing this deep water is not replaced every year and low oxygen concentration makes the deep water unsuitable for fish and animals. In the most extreme cases, there is a constant barrier of freshwater on the surface and the fjord freezes over such that there is no oxygen below the surface. Drammensfjorden is one example. The mixing in fjords predominantly results from the propagation of an internal tide from the entrance sill or internal seiching.\nThe Gaupnefjorden branch of Sognefjorden is strongly affected by freshwater as a glacial river flows in. Velfjorden has little inflow of freshwater.\nCoral reefs.\nIn 2000, some coral reefs were discovered along the bottoms of the Norwegian fjords. These reefs were found in fjords from the north of Norway to the south. The marine life on the reefs is believed to be one of the most important reasons why the Norwegian coastline is such a generous fishing ground. Since this discovery is fairly new, little research has been done. The reefs are host to thousands of lifeforms such as plankton, coral, anemones, fish, several species of shark, and many more. Most are specially adapted to life under the greater pressure of the water column above it, and the total darkness of the deep sea.\nNew Zealand's fjords are also host to deep-water corals, but a surface layer of dark fresh water allows these corals to grow in much shallower water than usual. An underwater observatory in Milford Sound allows tourists to view them without diving.\nSkerries.\nIn some places near the seaward margins of areas with fjords, the ice-scoured channels are so numerous and varied in direction that the rocky coast is divided into thousands of island blocks, some large and mountainous while others are merely rocky points or rock reefs, menacing navigation. These are called skerries. The term skerry is derived from the Old Norse \", which means a rock in the sea.\nSkerries most commonly formed at the outlet of fjords where submerged glacially formed valleys perpendicular to the coast join with other cross valleys in a complex array. The island fringe of Norway is such a group of skerries (called a \"); many of the cross fjords are so arranged that they parallel the coast and provide a protected channel behind an almost unbroken succession of mountainous islands and skerries. By this channel, one can travel through a protected passage almost the entire route from Stavanger to North Cape, Norway. The Blindleia is a skerry-protected waterway that starts near Kristiansand in southern Norway and continues past Lillesand. The Swedish coast along Bohusl\u00e4n is likewise skerry guarded. The Inside Passage provides a similar route from Seattle, Washington, and Vancouver, British Columbia, to Skagway, Alaska. Yet another such skerry-protected passage extends from the Straits of Magellan north for .\nPhytoplankton.\nFjords provide unique environmental conditions for phytoplankton communities. In polar fjords, glacier and ice sheet outflow add cold, fresh meltwater along with transported sediment into the body of water. Nutrients provided by this outflow can significantly enhance phytoplankton growth. For example, in some fjords of the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), nutrient enrichment from meltwater drives diatom blooms, a highly productive group of phytoplankton that enable such fjords to be valuable feeding grounds for other species. It is possible that as climate change reduces long-term meltwater output, nutrient dynamics within such fjords will shift to favor less productive species, destabilizing the food web ecology of fjord systems.\nIn addition to nutrient flux, sediment carried by flowing glaciers can become suspended in the water column, increasing turbidity and reducing light penetration into greater depths of the fjord. This effect can limit the available light for photosynthesis in deeper areas of the water mass, reducing phytoplankton abundance beneath the surface.\nOverall, phytoplankton abundance and species composition within fjords is highly seasonal, varying as a result of seasonal light availability and water properties that depend on glacial melt and the formation of sea ice. The study of phytoplankton communities within fjords is an active area of research, supported by groups such as FjordPhyto, a citizen science initiative to study phytoplankton samples collected by local residents, tourists, and boaters of all backgrounds.\nEpishelf lakes.\nAn epishelf lake forms when meltwater is trapped behind a floating ice shelf and the freshwater floats on the denser saltwater below. Its surface may freeze forming an isolated ecosystem.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"fjord\" is borrowed from Norwegian, where it is pronounced , , or in various dialects and has a more general meaning, referring in many cases to any long, narrow body of water, inlet or channel (for example, see Oslofjord).\nThe Norwegian word is inherited from Old Norse , a noun which refers to a 'lake-like' body of water used for passage and ferrying and is closely related to the noun \"travelling, ferrying, journey\". Both words go back to Indo-European \"crossing\", from the root \"cross\". The words \"fare\" and \"ferry\" are of the same origin.\nThe Scandinavian \"fjord\", Proto-Scandinavian , is the origin for similar Germanic words: Icelandic , Faroese , Swedish (for Baltic waterbodies), Scots (for marine waterbodies, mainly in Scotland and northern England). The Norse noun was adopted in German as , used for the narrow long bays of Schleswig-Holstein, and in English as \"firth\" \"fjord, river mouth\". The English word \"ford\" (compare German , Low German or , in Dutch names such as Vilvoorde, Ancient Greek , , and Latin ) is assumed to originate from Germanic and Indo-European root meaning \"crossing point\". Fjord/firth/F\u00f6rde as well as ford/Furt/V\u00f6rde/voorde refer to a Germanic noun for \"a travel\": North Germanic or and of the verb \"to travel\", Dutch , German ; English \"to fare\".\nAs a loanword from Norwegian, it is one of the few words in the English language to start with the sequence \"fj\". The word was for a long time normally spelled \"fiord\", a spelling preserved in place names such as Grise Fiord. The \"fiord\" spelling mostly remains only in New Zealand English, as in the place name Fiordland.\nScandinavian usage.\nThe use of the word fjord in Norwegian, Danish and Swedish is more general than in English and in international scientific terminology. In Scandinavia, \"fjord\" is used for a narrow inlet of the sea in Norway, Denmark and western Sweden, but this is not its only application. In Norway and Iceland, the usage is closest to the Old Norse, with fjord used for both a firth and for a long, narrow inlet. In eastern Norway, the term is also applied to long narrow freshwater lakes (Randsfjorden and Tyrifjorden) and sometimes even to rivers (for instance in Fl\u00e5 Municipality in Hallingdal, the Hallingdal river is referred to as ). In southeast Sweden, the name fjard is a subdivision of the term 'fjord' used for bays, bights and narrow inlets on the Swedish Baltic Sea coast, and in most Swedish lakes. This latter term is also used for bodies of water off the coast of Finland where Finland Swedish is spoken. In Danish, the word may even apply to shallow lagoons. In modern Icelandic, is still used with the broader meaning of firth or inlet. In Faroese is used both about inlets and about broader sounds, whereas a narrower sound is called . In the Finnish language, a word is used although there is only one fjord in Finland.\nIn old Norse genitive was whereas dative was . The dative form has become common place names like F\u00f8rde (for instance F\u00f8rde), Fyrde or F\u00f8rre (for instance F\u00f8rre).\nThe German use of the word for long narrow bays on their Baltic Sea coastline, indicates a common Germanic origin of the word. The landscape consists mainly of moraine heaps. The and some \"fjords\" on the east side of Jutland, Denmark are also of glacial origin. But while the glaciers digging \"real\" fjords moved from the mountains to the sea, in Denmark and Germany they were tongues of a huge glacier covering the basin of which is now the Baltic Sea. See F\u00f6rden and East Jutland Fjorde.\nWhereas fjord names mostly describe bays (though not always geological fjords), straits in the same regions typically are named \"Sund\", in Scandinavian languages as well as in German. The word is related to \"to sunder\" in the meaning of \"to separate\". So the use of \"Sound\" to name fjords in North America and New Zealand differs from the European meaning of that word.\nThe name of Wexford in Ireland is originally derived from (\"inlet of the mud flats\") in Old Norse, as used by the Viking settlers\u2014though the inlet at that place in modern terms is an estuary, not a fjord. Similarly the name of Milford (now Milford Haven) in Wales is derived from (\"sandbank fjord/inlet\"), though the inlet on which it is located is actually a ria.\nBefore or in the early phase of Old Norse was another common noun for fjords and other inlets of the ocean. This word has survived only as a suffix in names of some Scandinavian fjords and has in same cases also been transferred to adjacent settlements or surrounding areas for instance Hardanger, Stavanger, and Geiranger.\nDifferences in definitions.\nThe differences in usage between the English and the Scandinavian languages have contributed to confusion in the use of the term fjord. Bodies of water that are clearly fjords in Scandinavian languages are not considered fjords in English; similarly bodies of water that would clearly not be fjords in the Scandinavian sense have been named or suggested to be fjords. Examples of this confused usage follow.\nIn the Danish language some inlets are called a fjord, but are, according to the English language definition, technically not a fjord, such as Roskilde Fjord. Limfjord in English terminology is a sound, since it separates the North Jutlandic Island (Vendsyssel-Thy) from the rest of Jutland. However, the Limfjord once was a fjord until the sea broke through from the west. Ringk\u00f8bing Fjord on the western coast of Jutland is a lagoon. The long narrow fjords of Denmark's Baltic Sea coast like the German were dug by ice moving from the sea upon land, while fjords in the geological sense were dug by ice moving from the mountains down to the sea. However, some definitions of a fjord is: \"A long narrow inlet consisting of only one inlet created by glacial activity\". Examples of Danish fjords are: Kolding Fjord, Vejle Fjord and Mariager Fjord.\nThe fjords in Finnmark in Norway, which are fjords in the Scandinavian sense of the term, are not universally considered to be fjords by the scientific community, because although glacially formed, most Finnmark fjords lack the steep-sided valleys of the more southerly Norwegian fjords. The glacial pack was deep enough to cover even the high grounds when they were formed. The Oslofjord, on the other hand, is a rift valley, and not glacially formed.\nThe indigenous M\u0101ori people of New Zealand see a fjord as a kind of sea () that runs by a bluff (, altogether \"bluff sea\").\n\"Fjords\" not created by glaciers.\nThe term \"fjord\" is sometimes applied to steep-sided inlets which were not created by glaciers. Most such inlets are drowned river canyons or rias. Examples include:\nFreshwater fjords.\nSome Norwegian freshwater lakes that have formed in long glacially carved valleys with sill thresholds, ice front deltas or terminal moraines blocking the outlet follow the Norwegian naming convention; they are frequently named fjords. Ice front deltas developed when the ice front was relatively stable for long time during the melting of the ice shield. The resulting landform is an isthmus between the lake and the saltwater fjord, in Norwegian called \"eid\" as in placename Eidfjord or Nordfjordeid. The post-glacial rebound changed these deltas into terraces up to the level of the original sea level. In Eidfjord, Eio has dug through the original delta and left a terrace while lake is only above sea level. Such deposits are valuable sources of high-quality building materials (sand and gravel) for houses and infrastructure. Eidfjord village sits on the \"eid\" or isthmus between Eidfjordvatnet lake and Eidfjorden branch of Hardangerfjord. Nordfjordeid is the isthmus with a village between Hornindalsvatnet lake and Nordfjord. Such lakes are also denoted \"fjord valley lakes\" by geologists.\nOne of Norway's largest is Tyrifjorden at above sea level and an average depth at most of the lake is under sea level. Norway's largest lake, Mj\u00f8sa, is also referred to as \"the fjord\" by locals. Another example is the freshwater fjord Movatnet (Mo lake) that until 1743 was separated from Romarheimsfjorden by an isthmus and connected by a short river. During a flood in November 1743, the river bed eroded and sea water could flow into the lake at high tide. Eventually, Movatnet became a saltwater fjord and renamed Mofjorden (Mofjorden). Like fjords, freshwater lakes are often deep. For instance Hornindalsvatnet is at least deep and water takes an average of 16 years to flow through the lake. Such lakes created by glacial action are also called fjord lakes or moraine-dammed lakes.\nSome of these lakes were salt after the ice age but later cut off from the ocean during the post-glacial rebound. At the end of the ice age Eastern Norway was about lower (the marine limit). When the ice cap receded and allowed the ocean to fill valleys and lowlands, and lakes like Mj\u00f8sa and Tyrifjorden were part of the ocean while Drammen valley was a narrow fjord. At the time of the Vikings Drammensfjord was still higher than today and reached the town of Hokksund, while parts of what is now the city of Drammen was under water. After the ice age the ocean was about at Notodden. The ocean stretched like a fjord through Heddalsvatnet all the way to Hjartdal. Post-glacial rebound eventually separated Heddalsvatnet from the ocean and turned it into a freshwater lake. In Neolithic times Heddalsvatnet was still a saltwater fjord connected to the ocean, and was cut off from the ocean around 1500 BC.\nSome freshwater fjords such as Slidrefjord are above the marine limit.\nLike freshwater fjords, the continuation of fjords on land are in the same way denoted as \"fjord-valleys\". For instance Fl\u00e5msdal (Fl\u00e5m valley) and M\u00e5b\u00f8dalen.\nOutside of Norway, the three western arms of New Zealand's Lake Te Anau are named North Fiord, Middle Fiord and South Fiord. Another freshwater \"fjord\" in a larger lake is Western Brook Pond, in Newfoundland's Gros Morne National Park; it is also often described as a fjord, but is actually a freshwater lake cut off from the sea, so is not a fjord in the English sense of the term. Locally they refer to it as a \"landlocked fjord\". Such lakes are sometimes called \"fjord lakes\". Okanagan Lake was the first North American lake to be so described, in 1962. The bedrock there has been eroded up to \"below\" sea level, which is below the surrounding regional topography. Fjord lakes are common on the inland lea of the Coast Mountains and Cascade Range; notable ones include Lake Chelan, Seton Lake, Chilko Lake, and Atlin Lake. Kootenay Lake, Slocan Lake and others in the basin of the Columbia River are also fjord-like in nature, and created by glaciation in the same way. Along the British Columbia Coast, a notable fjord-lake is Owikeno Lake, which is a freshwater extension of Rivers Inlet. Quesnel Lake, located in central British Columbia, is claimed to be the deepest fjord formed lake on Earth.\nGreat Lakes.\nA family of freshwater fjords are the embayments of the North American Great Lakes. Baie Fine is located on the northwestern coast of Georgian Bay of Lake Huron in Ontario, and Huron Bay is located on the southern shore of Lake Superior in Michigan. \nLocations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe principal mountainous regions where fjords have formed are in the higher middle latitudes and the high latitudes reaching to 80\u00b0N (Svalbard, Greenland), where, during the glacial period, many valley glaciers descended to the then-lower sea level. The fjords develop best in mountain ranges against which the prevailing westerly marine winds are orographically lifted over the mountainous regions, resulting in abundant snowfall to feed the glaciers. Hence coasts having the most pronounced fjords include the west coast of Norway, the west coast of North America from Puget Sound to Alaska, the southwest coast of New Zealand, and the west and to south-western coasts of South America, chiefly in Chile.\nOther glaciated or formerly glaciated regions.\nOther regions have fjords, but many of these are less pronounced due to more limited exposure to westerly winds and less pronounced relief. Areas include:\nExtreme fjords.\nThe longest fjords in the world are:\nDeep fjords include:\nHeritage fjords.\nNorway has several heritage fjords, including UNESCO World Heritage Sites and other notable fjords, these will require visiting ships to be low-emission by 2026 and zero-emission by 2032\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "43600", "revid": "28903366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43600", "title": "Crayfish", "text": "Freshwater crustaceans\nCrayfish are freshwater crustaceans belonging to the infraorder Astacidea, which also contains lobsters. Taxonomically, they are members of the superfamilies Astacoidea and Parastacoidea. They breathe through feather-like gills. Some species are found in brooks and streams, where fresh water is running, while others thrive in swamps, ditches, and paddy fields. Most crayfish cannot tolerate polluted water, although some species, such as \"Procambarus clarkii\", are hardier. Crayfish feed on animals and plants, either living or decomposing, and detritus.\nThe term \"crayfish\" is applied to saltwater species in some countries.\nTerminology.\nThe name \"crayfish\" comes from the Old French word ' (Modern French '). The word has been modified to \"crayfish\" by association with \"fish\" (folk etymology). The largely American variant \"crawfish\" is similarly derived.\nSome kinds of crayfish are known locally as lobsters, crawdads, mudbugs, and yabbies. In the Eastern United States, \"crayfish\" is more common in the north, while \"crawdad\" is heard more in central and southwestern regions, and \"crawfish\" farther south, although considerable overlaps exist.\nThe study of crayfish is called astacology.\nAnatomy.\nThe body of a decapod crustacean, such as a crab, lobster, or prawn (shrimp), is made up of twenty body segments grouped into two main body parts, the cephalothorax and the abdomen. Each segment may possess two pairs of appendages, although in various groups, these may be reduced or gone. On average, crayfish grow to in length. Walking legs have a small claw at the end.\nDiet.\nCrayfish are opportunistic omnivorous scavengers, with the ability to filter and process mud. In aquaculture ponds using isotope analysis they were shown to build body tissue selectively from the animal protein portion of pelleted food and not the other components of the pellet.\nThey have the potential to eat most foods, even nutrient poor material such as grass, leaves, and paper, but can be highly selective and need variety to balance their diet. The personalities of the individual crayfish can be a key determinant in the food preference behaviour in aquaria.\nCrayfish all over the world can be seen in an ecological role of benthic dwellers, so this is where most of their food is obtained \u2013 at the sediment/water interface in ponds, lakes, swamps, or burrows. When the gut contents are analysed, most of the contents is mud: fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) and mixed particles of lignin and cellulose (roots, leaves, bark, wood). Some animal material can also be identified, but this only contributes a small portion of the diet by volume. \nThey feed on submerged vegetable material at times, but their ability to catch large living animal material is restricted. They can feed on interstitial organisms if they can be grasped in the small feeding claws. They can be lured into traps with an array of baits from dog biscuits, fish heads, meat, etc., all of which reinforces the fact that they are generalist feeders. \nOn a day-to-day basis, they consume what they can acquire in their immediate environment in limited space and time available - detritus. At a microbial level, the FPOM has a high surface area of organic particles and consists of a plethora of substrate and bacteria, fungi, micro-algae, meiofauna, partially decomposed organic material and mucus. This mucus or \"slime\" is a biofilm and can be felt on the surface of leaves and sticks. Also crayfish have been shown to be coprophagic \u2013 eating their own faeces, they also eat their own exuviae (moulted carapace) and each other. They have even been observed leaving the water to graze.\nDetritus or mud is a mixture of dead plankton (plant and animal), organic wastes from the water column, and debris derived from the aquatic and terrestrial environments. Mostly detritus is in the end phase of decomposition and is recognised as black organic mud. The crayfish usually ingest the material in only a few minutes, as distinct from grazing for many hours. The material is mixed with digestive fluids and sorted by size. The finer particles follow a slower and more exacting route through to the hindgut, compared to the coarser material. The coarser material is eliminated first and often reappears in approximately 10 to 12 hours, whereas the finer material is usually eliminated from 16 to 26 hours after ingestion.\nAll waste products coming out through the hindgut are wrapped in a peritrophic membrane, so they look like a tube. Such an investment in the wrapping of the microbial free faeces in a protein rich membrane is most likely the reason they are coprophagic. Such feeding behaviour based on selection, ingestion, and extreme processing ensures periodic feeding, as distinct from continuous grazing. They tend to eat to satiation and then take many hours to process the material, leaving minimal chance of having more room to ingest other items. Crayfish usually have limited home range and so they rest, digest, and eliminate their waste, most commonly in the same location each day.\nFeeding exposes the crayfish to risk of predation, and so feeding behaviour is often rapid and synchronised with feeding processes that reduce such risks \u2013 eat, hide, process and eliminate.\nKnowledge of the diet of these creatures was considered too complex since the first book ever written in the field of zoology, \"The Crayfish\" by T.H. Huxley (1879), where they were described as \"detritivores\". This is why most researchers have not attempted to understand the diet of freshwater crayfish. The most complex study which matched the structure and function of the whole digestive tract with ingested material was performed in the 1990s by Brett O'Brien on marron, the least aggressive of the larger freshwater crayfish with aquaculture potential, similar to redclaw and yabbies.\nClassification and geographical distribution.\nCrayfish are closely related to lobsters, and together they belong to the infraorder Astacidea. Their phylogeny can be shown in the simplified cladogram below:\nFour extant (living) families of crayfish are described, three in the Northern Hemisphere and one in the Southern Hemisphere. The Southern Hemisphere (Gondwana-distributed) family Parastacidae, with 14 extant genera and two extinct genera, live(d) in South America, Madagascar, and Australasia. They are distinguished by the absence of the first pair of pleopods. Of the other three Northern Hemisphere families (grouped in the superfamily Astacoidea), the four genera of the family Astacidae live in western Eurasia and western North America, the 15 genera of the family Cambaridae live in eastern North America, and the single genus of Cambaroididae live in eastern Asia.\nNorth America.\nThe greatest diversity of crayfish species is found in southeastern North America, with over 330 species in 15 genera, all in the family Cambaridae. A further genus of astacid crayfish is found in the Pacific Northwest and the headwaters of some rivers east of the Continental Divide. Many crayfish are also found in lowland areas where the water is abundant in calcium, and oxygen rises from underground springs. Crayfish are also found in some non-coastal wetlands; eight species of crayfish live in Iowa, for example.\nIn 1983, Louisiana designated the crayfish, or crawfish as they are commonly called, as its official state crustacean. Louisiana produces of crawfish per year with the red swamp and white river crawfish being the main species harvested. Crawfish are a part of Cajun culture dating back hundreds of years. A variety of cottage industries have developed as a result of commercialized crawfish iconography. Their products include crawfish attached to wooden plaques, T-shirts with crawfish logos, and crawfish pendants, earrings, and necklaces made of gold or silver.\nAustralia.\nAustralia has over 100 species in a dozen genera. It is home to the world's three largest freshwater crayfish:\nMany of the better-known Australian crayfish are of the genus \"Cherax\", and include the common yabby (\"C. destructor\"), western yabby (\"C. preissii\"), and red-claw crayfish (\"C. quadricarinatus\").\nThe marron species \"C. tenuimanus\" is critically endangered, while other large Australasian crayfish are threatened or endangered.\nNew Zealand.\nIn New Zealand, two species of \"Paranephrops\" are endemic, and are known by the M\u0101ori name \"\".\nOther animals.\nIn Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, the term \"crayfish\" or \"cray\" generally refers to a saltwater spiny lobster, of the genus \"Jasus\" that is indigenous to much of southern Oceania, while the freshwater species are usually called \"yabbies\" or \"\", from the indigenous Australian and M\u0101ori names for the animal, respectively, or by other names specific to each species. Exceptions include western rock lobster (of the Palinuridae family) found on the west coast of Australia (it is a spiny lobster, but not of \"Jasus)\"; the Tasmanian giant freshwater crayfish (from the Parastacidae family and therefore a true crayfish) found only in Tasmania; and the Murray crayfish found along Australia's Murray River.\nIn Singapore, the term crayfish typically refers to \"Thenus orientalis\", a seawater crustacean from the slipper lobster family. True crayfish are not native to Singapore, but are commonly found as pets, or as an invasive species (\"Cherax quadricarinatus\") in the many water catchment areas, and are alternatively known as \"freshwater lobsters\".\nIn the United Kingdom and Ireland, the terms crayfish or crawfish commonly refer to the European spiny lobster, a saltwater species found in much of the East Atlantic and Mediterranean. The only true crayfish species native to the British Isles is the endangered white clawed crayfish.\nFossil record.\nFossil burrows very similar in construction to those of modern crayfish and likely produced by early crayfish are known from the Early Permian (~300-270 million years ago) of equatorial Pangea, in what is now North America (Washington Formation), and Europe (Sardinia). The oldest body fossils assigned to crayfish are known from the Late Triassic (~230-200 million years ago) Chinle Formation of North America, assigned to the species \"Enoploclytia\" \"porteri\" and \"Camborygma eumekenomos,\" which are not assigned to any modern families. An indeterminate member of the modern family Cambaridae is known from the Late Jurassic Morrison Formation of North America. The earliest records of other modern families date to the Early Cretaceous, including the parastacid \"Palaeoechinastacus\" from Australia which is 115\u00a0million years old, the cambaroidid \"Palaeocambarus\" from the Yixian Formation of China which is likely around 120 million years old (Barremian-Aptian), and the astacid \"\"Austropotamobius\" llopisi\" from the Las Hoyas site in Spain (Barremian).\nThreats to crayfish.\nCrayfish are susceptible to infections such as crayfish plague and to environmental stressors including acidification. In Europe, they are particularly threatened by crayfish plague, which is caused by the North American water mold \"Aphanomyces astaci.\" This water mold was transmitted to Europe when North American species of crayfish were introduced. Species of the genus \"Astacus\" are particularly susceptible to infection, allowing the plague-coevolved signal crayfish (native to western North America) to invade parts of Europe.\nAcid rain can cause problems for crayfish across the world. In whole-ecosystem experiments simulating acid rain at the Experimental Lakes Area in Ontario, Canada, crayfish populations crashed \u2013 probably because their exoskeletons are weaker in acidified environments.\nInvasive pest.\nIn several countries, particularly in Europe, native species of crayfish are under threat by imported species, particularly the signal crayfish (\"Pacifastacus leniusculus\"). Crayfish are also considered an invasive predatory species, endangering native European species such as the Italian agile frog and the painted frog in Malta.\nUses.\nCulinary use.\nCrayfish are eaten worldwide. Like other edible crustaceans, only a small portion of the body of a crayfish is eaten. In most prepared dishes, such as soups, bisques and \u00e9touff\u00e9es, only the tail portion is served. At crawfish boils or other meals where the entire body of the crayfish is presented, other portions, such as the claw meat, may be eaten.\nResearch shows that crayfish do not die immediately when boiled alive, and respond to pain in a similar way to mammals. Then the stress hormone cortisol is released and this leads to the formation of lactic acid in the muscles, which makes the meat taste sour. Crayfish can be cooked more humanely by first freezing them unconscious for a few hours, then destroying the central nervous system along their abdomen by cutting the crayfish lengthwise with a long knife down the center of the crayfish before cooking it.\nGlobal crayfish production is centered in Asia, primarily China. In 2018, Asian production accounted for 95% of the world's crayfish supply.\nCrayfish is part of Swedish cuisine and is usually eaten in August at special crayfish parties (). Documentation of the consumption of crayfish dates to at least the 16th century. On the Swedish west coast, Nephrops norvegicus (, lit.\u2009'sea crayfish') is more commonly eaten while various freshwater crayfish are consumed in the rest of the country. Prior to the 1960s, crayfish was largely inaccessible to the urban population in Sweden and consumption was largely limited to the upper classes or farmers holding fishing rights in fresh water lakes. With the introduction of import of frozen crayfish the crayfish party is now widely practiced across all spheres in Sweden and among the Swedish-speaking population of Finland.\nIn the United States, crayfish production is strongly centered in Louisiana, with 93% of crayfish farms located in the state as of 2018. In 1987, Louisiana produced 90% of the crayfish harvested in the world, 70% of which were consumed locally. In 2007, the Louisiana crayfish harvest was about 54,800 tons, almost all of it from aquaculture. About 70\u201380% of crayfish produced in Louisiana are \"Procambarus clarkii\" (red swamp crawfish), with the remaining 20\u201330% being \"Procambarus zonangulus\" (white river crawfish). Optimum dietary nutritional requirement of freshwater crayfish, or crayfish nutrient specifications are now available for aquaculture feed producers \nLike all crustaceans, crayfish are not kosher because they are aquatic animals that do not have both fins and scales. They are therefore not eaten by observant Jews, and some Christian denominations.\nBait.\nCrayfish are preyed upon by a variety of ray-finned fishes, and are commonly used as bait, either live or with only the tail meat. They are a popular bait for catching catfish, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, striped bass, perch, pike and muskie. When using live crayfish as bait, anglers prefer to hook them between the eyes, piercing through their hard, pointed beak which causes them no harm; therefore, they remain more active.\nWhen using crayfish as bait, it is important to fish in the same environment where they were caught. An Illinois State University report that focused on studies conducted on the Fox River and Des Plaines River watershed stated that rusty crayfish, initially caught as bait in a different environment, were dumped into the water and \"outcompeted the native clearwater crayfish\". Other studies confirmed that transporting crayfish to different environments has led to various ecological problems, including the elimination of native species. Transporting crayfish as live bait has also contributed to the spread of zebra mussels in various waterways throughout Europe and North America, as they are known to attach themselves to exoskeleton of crayfishes.\nPets.\nCrayfish are kept as pets in freshwater aquariums. They prefer foods like shrimp pellets or various vegetables, but will also eat tropical fish food, regular fish food, algae wafers, and small fish that can be captured with their claws. A report by the National Park Service as well as video and anecdotal reports by aquarium owners indicate that crayfish will eat their moulted exoskeleton \"to recover the calcium and phosphates contained in it.\" As omnivores, crayfish will eat almost anything; therefore, they may explore the edibility of aquarium plants in a fish tank. However, most species of dwarf crayfish, such as \"Cambarellus patzcuarensis\", will not destructively dig or eat live aquarium plants.\nIn some nations, such as the United Kingdom, United States, Australia, and New Zealand, imported alien crayfish are a danger to local rivers. The three most widespread American species invasive in Europe are \"Faxonius limosus\", \"Pacifastacus leniusculus\" and \"Procambarus clarkii\". Crayfish may spread into different bodies of water because specimens captured for pets in one river are often released into a different catchment. There is a potential for ecological damage when crayfish are introduced into non-native bodies of water: e.g., crayfish plague in Europe, or the introduction of the common yabby (\"Cherax destructor\") into drainages east of the Great Dividing Range in Australia.\nEducation.\nSome public schools in the United States keep live crayfish in the classroom and have the students take care of them in order to give the students a greater understanding of the creatures.\nSentinel species.\nThe Protivin brewery in the Czech Republic uses crayfish outfitted with sensors to detect any changes in their bodies or pulse activity in order to monitor the purity of the water used in their product. The creatures are kept in a fish tank that is fed with the same local natural source water used in their brewing. If three or more of the crayfish have changes to their pulses, employees know there is a change in the water and examine the parameters.\nScientists also monitor crayfish in the wild in natural bodies of water to study the levels of pollutants there.

It was established on 12 July 1996 in Wassenaar, Netherlands, as the successor to the Cold War\u2013era Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom), which restricted certain goods to the Eastern Bloc.\nThe Wassenaar Arrangement was established to \"contribute to regional and international security and stability by promoting transparency and greater responsibility\" among participating states, which coordinate their national policies to ensure certain technologies are not transferred or otherwise diverted to countries that undermine these goals. There are 42 participating states, including many former Comecon (Warsaw Pact) countries such as Russia. A secretariat for administering the agreement is based in Vienna, Austria.\nThe Wassenaar Arrangement is considerably less strict than CoCom, focusing primarily on the transparency of national export control regimes and not granting veto power to individual members over organizational decisions; like CoCom, it is not a treaty and therefore not legally binding. Every six months, member countries voluntarily exchange information on deliveries of conventional arms to non-Wassenaar members that fall under eight broad weapons categories: battle tanks, armoured fighting vehicles, large-calibre artillery, military aircraft, military helicopters, warships, missiles or missile systems, and small arms and light weapons.\nControl lists.\nThe outline of the arrangement is set out in a document entitled \"Guidelines &amp; Procedures, including the Initial Elements\". The http:// is broken into two parts, the \"List of Dual-Use Goods and Technologies\" (also known as the \"Basic List\") and the \"Munitions List\". The Basic List is composed of ten categories based on increasing levels of sophistication:\nBasic List has two nested subsections\u2014Sensitive and Very Sensitive. Items of the Very Sensitive List include materials for stealth technology\u2014i.e., equipment that could be used for submarine detection, advanced radar, and jet engine technologies.\nWithin each of the categories, there are 5 types of controlled item. These are approximately as follows:\nThe types of item B, C, D and E typically refer to the type A items, but there are many exceptions, e.g. some materials may be controlled, even though there is no specific good referred to.\nThe Wassenaar Arrangement List's categories are typically processed, and merged with other sources, e.g. Category 5.A.2 maps on to US ECCN 5A002, and EU control classification 5A002.\nThe Munitions List has 22 categories, which are not labeled.\nIn order for an item to be placed on the lists, member states must take into account the following \nhttps://:\nAdmission requirements.\nAdmission requires states to:\nThe Arrangement is open on a global and non-discriminatory basis to prospective adherents that comply with the agreed criteria. Admission of new members requires the consensus of all members.\nIndia joined as the 42nd participating state on 7 December 2017. \"Wassenaar Arrangement participating states reviewed the progress of a number of current membership applications and agreed at the plenary meeting to admit India which will become the Arrangement's 42nd participating state as soon as the necessary procedural arrangements for joining the WA are completed\", the grouping said in a statement. India's application was supported by Russia, the United States, France and Germany.\n2013 amendments.\nIn December 2013, the list of export restricted technologies was amended to include Internet-based surveillance systems. New technologies placed under the export control regime include \"intrusion software\"\u2014software designed to defeat a computer or network's protective measures so as to extract data or information\u2014as well as IP network surveillance systems.\nThe purpose of the amendments was to prevent Western technology companies from selling surveillance technology to governments known to abuse human rights. However, some technology companies have expressed concerns that the scope of the controls may be too broad, limiting security researchers' ability to identify and correct security vulnerabilities. Google and Facebook criticised the agreement for the restrictions it will place on activities like penetration testing, sharing information about threats, and bug bounty programs. They argue that the restrictions will weaken the security of participating nations and do little to curb threats from non-participant nations.\n\"Wassenaar minus one\".\nDuring 2022 and 2023, a variety of proposals for modification to the listed items were proposed within Wassenaar, but were not accepted. Several states made unilateral legislation, rather than obtaining harmonisation through the Arrangement, including:\nThe corresponding proposals within WA were not accepted, due to objection from the Russian delegation. Only minor and editorial changes were universally accepted. At the time, Russia faced international sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine.\nConsequently in mid 2024 and later, many Wassenaar nations have implemented export controls corresponding to the unilateral legislation above. These include UK and Canada. These are classified as 'country specific', although there appears to be harmonisation of these 2024 controls across many advanced economies. The introduction of these controls caused surprise in some circles. Other nations largely harmonised their export controls over the course of 2024 and early 2025.\nMembership.\nThe 42 states that have been participating since December 2017 are:\n \u2013 European Union member state. \u2013 NATO member.\nCandidates.\nChile.\nChile has been candidate for Nuclear Suppliers Group and Wassenaar Arrangement since 2015 as part of its national commitments with the UNSC resolution 1540 of 2004.

{"id": "43604", "revid": "152727", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43604", "title": "Bud", "text": "Immature or embryonic shoot\nIn botany, a bud is an undeveloped or embryonic shoot and normally occurs in the axil of a leaf or at the tip of a stem. Once formed, a bud may remain for some time in a dormant condition, or it may form a shoot immediately. Buds may be specialized to develop flowers or short shoots or may have the potential for general shoot development. The term bud is also used in zoology, where it refers to an outgrowth from the body which can develop into a new individual.\nOverview.\nThe buds of many woody plants, especially in temperate or cold climates, are protected by a covering of modified leaves called \"scales\" which tightly enclose the more delicate parts of the bud. Many bud scales are covered by a gummy substance which serves as added protection. When the bud develops, the scales may enlarge somewhat but usually just drop off, leaving a series of horizontally-elongated scars on the surface of the growing stem. By means of these scars one can determine the age of any young branch, since each year's growth ends in the formation of a bud, the formation of which produces an additional group of bud scale scars. Continued growth of the branch causes these scars to be obliterated after a few years so that the total age of older branches cannot be determined by this means.\nIn many plants, scales do not form over the bud, and the bud is then called a naked bud. The minute underdeveloped leaves in such buds are often excessively hairy. Naked buds are found in some shrubs, like some species of the Sumac and Viburnums (\"Viburnum alnifolium\" and \"V. lantana\") and in herbaceous plants. In many of the latter, buds are even more reduced, often consisting of undifferentiated masses of cells in the axils of leaves. A terminal bud occurs on the end of a stem and lateral buds are found on the side. A head of cabbage (see Brassica) is an exceptionally large terminal bud, while Brussels sprouts are large lateral buds.\nSince buds are formed in the axils of leaves, their distribution on the stem is the same as that of leaves. There are alternate, opposite, and whorled buds, as well as the terminal bud at the tip of the stem. In many plants buds appear in unexpected places: these are known as adventitious buds.\nOften it is possible to find a bud in a remarkable series of gradations of bud scales. In the buckeye, for example, one may see a complete gradation from the small brown outer scale through larger scales which on unfolding become somewhat green to the inner scales of the bud, which are remarkably leaf-like. Such a series suggests that the scales of the bud are in truth leaves, modified to protect the more delicate parts of the plant during unfavorable periods.\nTypes of buds.\nBuds are often useful in the identification of plants, especially for woody plants in winter when leaves have fallen. Buds may be classified and described according to different criteria: location, status, morphology, and function.\nBotanists commonly use the following terms:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "43607", "revid": "20483999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43607", "title": "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon", "text": "Parlor game on degrees of separation\nSix Degrees of Kevin Bacon or Bacon's Law is a parlor game where players challenge each other to choose an actor whom they connect to another actor via a film in which both actors appeared: this is repeated to try to find the shortest path that leads to prolific American actor Kevin Bacon. It rests on the assumption that anyone involved in the Hollywood film industry can be linked through their film roles to Bacon within six steps. The game's name is a reference to \"six degrees of separation\", a concept that posits that any two people on Earth are six or fewer acquaintance links apart.\nIn 2007, Bacon started a charitable organization called SixDegrees.org. In 2020, Bacon started a podcast called \"The Last Degree of Kevin Bacon\".\nHistory.\nIn a January 1994 interview with \"Premiere\" magazine, Kevin Bacon mentioned while discussing the film \"The River Wild\" that \"he had worked with everybody in Hollywood or someone who's worked with them.\" Following this, a lengthy newsgroup thread which was headed \"Kevin Bacon is the Center of the Universe\" appeared. In 1994, three Albright College students \u2013 Craig Fass, Brian Turtle and Mike Ginelli \u2013 invented the game that became known as \"Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon\" after seeing two movies on television that featured Bacon back to back, \"Footloose\" and \"The Air Up There\". During the latter film they began to speculate on how many movies Bacon had been in and the number of people with whom he had worked.\nThey wrote a letter to talk show host Jon Stewart, telling him that \"Kevin Bacon was the center of the entertainment universe\" and explaining the game. They appeared on \"The Jon Stewart Show\" and \"The Howard Stern Show\" with Bacon to explain the game. Bacon admitted that he initially disliked the game because he believed it was ridiculing him, but he eventually came to enjoy it. The three inventors released a book, \"Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon\" (), with an introduction written by Bacon. A board game based on the concept was released by Endless Games.\nIn popular culture.\nIn 1995 Cartoon Network referenced the concept in a commercial, having Velma (from Scooby-Doo) as the central figure in the 'Cartoon Network Universe'. The commercial cites connections as arbitrary as fake appearances, sharing of clothes, or physical resemblance.\nThe concept was also presented in an episode of the TV show \"Mad About You\" dated November 19, 1996, in which a character expressed the opinion that every actor is only three degrees of separation from Kevin Bacon. Bacon spoofed the concept himself in a cameo he performed for the independent film \"We Married Margo\". Playing himself in a 2003 episode of \"Will and Grace\", Bacon connects himself to Val Kilmer through Tom Cruise and jokes \"Hey, that was a short one!\". The headline of \"The Onion\", a satirical newspaper, on October 30, 2002, was \"Kevin Bacon Linked To Al-Qaeda\". Bacon provides the voice-over commentary for the NY Skyride attraction at the Empire State Building in New York City. At several points throughout the commentary, Bacon alludes to his connections to Hollywood stars via other actors with whom he has worked.\nIn \"Scream 2\", written by Kevin Williamson, a sorority sister played by Portia De Rossi refers to Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon. Bacon himself later starred in \"The Following\", also created and written by Williamson, and broadcast on Fox between 2013 and 2015.\nThe annual \"31 Days of Oscar\" event on the Turner Classic Movies television channel sometimes includes a \"360 Degrees of Oscar\" strand where each film shown shares an actor with the previous one. It has been used as recently as 2020.\nIn 2009, Bacon narrated a National Geographic Channel show \"The Human Family Tree\" \u2013 a program which describes the efforts of that organization's Genographic Project to establish the genetic interconnectedness of all humans. Bacon appeared in a commercial for the Visa check card that referenced the game. In the commercial, Bacon wants to write a check to buy a book, but the clerk asks for his ID, which he does not have. He leaves and returns with a group of people, then says to the clerk, \"Okay, I was in a movie with an extra, Eunice, whose hairdresser, Wayne, attended Sunday school with Father O'Neill, who plays racquetball with Dr. Sanjay, who recently removed the appendix of Kim, who dumped you sophomore year. So you see, we're practically brothers.\"\nIn 2011, James Franco made reference to Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon while hosting the 83rd Academy Awards. EE began a UK television advertising campaign in November 2012, based on the Six Degrees concept, where Bacon illustrates his connections and draws attention to how the EE 4G network allows similar connectivity.\nIn \"Weird Al\" Yankovic's song \"Lame Claim to Fame\", one of the lines is, \"I know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy who knows Kevin Bacon.\" American rapper MC Zappa also makes reference to the game in his 2018 song \"Level Up (The Ill Cypher)\".\nThe most highly connected nodes of the Internet have been referred to as \"the Kevin Bacons of the Web\", inasmuch as they enable most users to navigate to most sites in 19 clicks or less.\nBacon numbers.\nThe Bacon number of an actor is the number of degrees of separation they have from Kevin Bacon, as defined by the game. This is an application of the Erd\u0151s number concept to the Hollywood movie industry. The higher the Bacon number, the greater the separation from Kevin Bacon the actor is.\nThe computation of a Bacon number for actor X is a \"shortest path\" algorithm, applied to the co-stardom network:\nExamples.\nBecause some people have both a finite Bacon \"and\" a finite Erd\u0151s number because of acting and publications, there are a rare few who have a finite Erd\u0151s\u2013Bacon number, which is defined as the sum of a person's independent Erd\u0151s and Bacon numbers.\nPhotography book.\nInspired by the game, the British photographer Andy Gotts tried to reach Kevin Bacon through photographic links instead of film links.\nGotts wrote to 300 actors asking to take their pictures and received permission only from Joss Ackland. Ackland then suggested that Gotts photograph Greta Scacchi, with whom he had appeared in the film \"White Mischief\". Gotts proceeded from there, asking each actor to refer him to one or more friends or colleagues. Eventually, Christian Slater referred him to Bacon. Gotts' photograph of Bacon completed the project, eight years after it began. Gotts published the photos in a book, \"Degrees\" (), with text by Alan Bates, Pierce Brosnan, and Bacon.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Shafter also played a prominent part as a major general in the Spanish\u2013American War. Fort Shafter, Hawaii, is named for him, as well as the city of Shafter, California and the ghost town of Shafter, Texas. He was nicknamed \"Pecos Bill\", inspiration for the fictional character of the same name in tall tales.\nEarly life.\nShafter was born in Galesburg, Michigan on October 16, 1835. His ancestors were of Scots-Irish descent and originally were settlers in Vermont. On his father's side, the family was of Scots-Irish descent, as his ancestor came from Northern Ireland and Scotland, arriving in Massachusetts in the year 1670. Subsequently, the Shafters later settled in Vermont.\nAmerican Civil War and Indian Wars.\nShafter served as a 1st lieutenant the U.S. Army's 7th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment at the battles of Ball's Bluff and Fair Oaks. He was wounded at the Battle of Fair Oaks and later received the Medal of Honor for heroism during the battle. He led a charge on the first day of the battle and was wounded towards the close of that day's fighting. In order to stay with his regiment he concealed his wounds, fighting on the second day of the battle. On August 22, 1862, he was mustered out of the volunteer service but returned to the field as major in the 19th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment. He was captured at the Battle of Thompson's Station and spent three months in a Confederate prison. In April 1864 after his release he was appointed colonel of the 17th United States Colored Infantry and led the regiment at the Battle of Nashville.\nBy the end of the war, he had been promoted to brevet brigadier general of volunteers. He stayed in the regular army when the war ended. During his subsequent service in the Indian Wars, he received his \"Pecos Bill\" nickname. He led the 24th Infantry, another United States Colored Troops regiment, in campaigns against the Cheyenne, Comanche, Kickapoo and Kiowa Indian warriors in Texas. While commander of Fort Davis, he started a controversial court-martial of second lieutenant Henry Flipper, the first black cadet to graduate from West Point. In May 1897 he was appointed as a brigadier general.\nSpanish\u2013American War.\nJust before the outbreak of the Spanish\u2013American War, Shafter was commander of the Department of California. Shafter was an unlikely candidate for command of the expedition to Cuba. He was approaching 63, weighed over 300 pounds and suffered from gout. Nevertheless, he received a promotion to Major General of Volunteers and command of the Fifth Army Corps being assembled in Tampa, Florida. One possible reason for his being given this command was his lack of political ambitions.\nShafter appeared to maintain a very loose control over the expedition to Cuba from the beginning, commencing with a very disorganized landing at Daiquiri on the southern coast of Cuba. Confusion prevailed over landing priorities and the chain of command. When General Sumner refused to allow the Army's Gatling Gun Detachment - which had priority - to disembark from the transport \"Cherokee\" on the grounds that the lieutenant commanding the detachment did not have the rank to enforce his priority, Shafter had to personally intervene, returning to the ship in a steam launch to enforce his demand that the guns come off immediately.\nDuring the disembarkation, Shafter sent forward Fifth Corps' Cavalry Division under Joseph Wheeler to reconnoiter the road to Santiago de Cuba. Apparently disregarding orders, Wheeler brought on a fight which escalated into the Battle of Las Guasimas. Shafter apparently did not realize the battle was even underway nor did he say anything to Wheeler about it afterward.\nA plan was finally developed for the attack on Santiago. Shafter would send his 1st Division (at the time, brigade and division numbers were not unique outside their parent formation) to attack El Caney while his 2nd Division and the Cavalry Division would attack the heights south of El Caney known as San Juan Hill. Originally, Shafter planned to lead his forces from the front, but he suffered greatly from the tropical heat and was confined to his headquarters far to the rear and out of sight of the fighting. Unable to see the battle firsthand, he never developed a coherent chain of command. Shafter's offensive battle plans were both simplistic and extremely vague. He seemed to be unaware or unconcerned about the mass killing effect of modern military weapons technology possessed by the Spanish. Further, his intelligence-gathering efforts on Spanish troop dispositions and equipment was extremely meager, though he had a number of sources available to him, including reconnaissance reports by Cuban rebel forces as well as espionage obtained from indigenous Cubans.\nDuring the hurried attack on El Caney and San Juan Heights, American forces, who had packed the available roads and were unable maneuver, suffered heavy losses from Spanish troops equipped with modern repeating smokeless powder rifles and breech-loading artillery, while the short-ranged black-powder guns of U.S. artillery units were unable to respond effectively. Additional casualties were incurred in the actual assault, which was marked by a series of brave but disorganized and uncoordinated advances. After suffering some 1,400 casualties, and aided by a single Gatling Gun detachment for fire support, American troops successfully stormed and occupied both El Caney and San Juan Heights.\nThe next task for Shafter was the investment and siege of the city of Santiago and its garrison. However, the extent of the American losses were becoming known at Shafter's headquarters back at Sevilla (his gout, poor physical condition, and huge bulk did not allow him to go to the front). The casualties were delivered not only by messenger report, but also by \"meat wagons\" delivering the wounded and dying to the hospital. Viewing the carnage, Shafter began to waver in his determination to defeat the Spanish at Santiago. He knew his troops' position was tenuous, but again had little intelligence on the hardships of the Spanish inside beleaguered Santiago. Shafter felt the Navy was doing little to relieve the pressure on his forces. Supplies could not be delivered to the front, leaving his men in want of necessities, particularly food rations. Shafter himself was ill, and very weak. With this view of events, Shafter sent a dramatic message to Washington. He suggested that the army should give up its attack and all its gains for the day, and withdraw to safer ground about five miles away. Fortunately, by the time this message reached Washington, Shafter changed his mind, and instead renewed siege operations after demanding the Spanish surrender the city and garrison of Santiago. With the victory of the U.S. Navy at the Battle of Santiago de Cuba, by Admirals William T. Sampson and Winfield Scott Schley, the fate of the Spanish position at Santiago was sealed. Shortly afterward, the Spanish commander surrendered the city.\n'Campaigning in Cuba' by George Kennan, 1899 (available on Gutenberg) presents a totally damning account of Shafter's command in the Cuba campaign by a gifted correspondent who was with the troops from Tampa to return:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Morbidly obese at 300 lbs with gout and probably diabetes at 63, Shafter should have been in a hospice, not a tropical hellhole where malaria, yellow fever and dysentery annihilated most of the invasion force within three weeks. Shafter himself was a basket case. Complete planning /logistical incompetence in Washington meant troops had virtually no medical supplies, or adequate rations or means to boil drinking water, and were forced to sleep on the wet ground in wet winter-weight uniforms as no shelters of hammocks were available. One of the most shameful events in US armed forces history for the waste of enlisted men.\nPostwar career and retirement.\nWith disease rampant in the American army in Cuba, Shafter and many of his officers favored a quick withdrawal from Cuba. Shafter personally left Cuba in September 1898. And after a stay in quarantine at Camp Wikoff, Shafter returned to serve as Commander of the Department of California from May 1897 through February 1901.\nAs Commander he oversaw the supplying of the Army's expedition to the Philippines, which escalated into the Philippine\u2013American War during the last years of Shafter's career. Hostilities broke out on February 4, 1899, and the war lasted through July 2, 1902, past Shafter's retirement. When the war was three months old, the Commander shared his views with the Chicago News:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It may be necessary to kill half the Filipinos in order that the remaining half of the population may be advanced to a higher plane of life than their present semi-barbarous state affords.\nShafter reiterated his opinion in January 1900: \"My plan would be to disarm the natives of the Philippine Islands, even if I have to kill half of them to do it. Then I would treat the rest of them with perfect justice.\"\nShafter was a member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States, the Military Order of Foreign Wars and the Sons of the American Revolution.\nShafter retired in 1901 to a farm next to his daughter's land in Bakersfield, California. He died there in 1906 and is buried at San Francisco National Cemetery.\nIn popular culture.\nShafter was portrayed by Rodger Boyce in the 1997 film \"Rough Riders\". Shafter appeared in the 1898 film \"Surrender of General Toral\".\nShafter is also notable for the fact that he has the highest known Bacon Number in the parlor game Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, at 10.\nMedal of Honor citation.\nRank and Organization:\nFirst Lieutenant, Company I, 7th Michigan Infantry.
