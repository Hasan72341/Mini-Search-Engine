{"id": "42521", "revid": "45371855", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42521", "title": "Hans Richter (artist)", "text": "German artist (1888\u20131976)\nHans Johannes Siegfried Richter (; ; 6 April 1888 \u2013 1 February 1976) was a German Dada painter, graphic artist, avant-garde film producer, and art historian. In 1965 he authored the book \"Dadaism\" about the history of the \"Dada\" movement. He was born in Berlin into a well-to-do family and died in Minusio, near Locarno, Switzerland.\nFrom Expressionism through Dadaism, Constructivism and Neoplasticism, he was one of the major figures of avant-garde art in the 1910s and 1920s and a catalyst for intellectuals and artists in many disciplines. Richter helped organise exhibitions which revived interest in Dada, both in the United States and Europe. In 1956 he made \"Dadascope\", a film dedicated to Dada poetry.\nYouth.\nHans Richter was born in 1888 to a Jewish family, the son of legation counselor Moritz Richter and his wife Ida Gabriela Rothschild. Even as a child, he wanted to be a painter. He began his first graphic works at the age of 14. His father initially forbade him from studying painting and persuaded him to study architecture instead. As a prerequisite, he completed a two-year apprenticeship as a carpenter and joiner in his father's business in Berlin. After completing his apprenticeship in 1908, his father enabled him to attend the Berlin Academy of Art.\nGermany.\nIn 1908 Richter entered the Academy of Fine Art in Berlin, and the following year the Academy of Fine Art in Weimar. Richter's first contacts with Modern Art were in 1912 through the Blaue Reiter and in 1913 through the Erster Deutscher Herbstsalon gallery Der Sturm, in Berlin. In 1914 he was influenced by Cubism.\nAt that time he also befriended Franz Pfemfert, who was the editor of \"Die Aktion\". Richter contributed to the periodical \"Die Aktion\" in Berlin. His first exhibition was in Munich in 1916, and \"Die Aktion\" published a special edition about him. In the same year he was wounded and discharged from the army and went to Z\u00fcrich and met Tristan Tzara, Marcel Janco, Jean Arp, and Hugo Ball, who together were forming the Dada movement, which he joined.\nRichter believed that the artist's duty was to be politically active by opposing war and supporting revolution. His first abstract art works were made in 1917. In 1918, Tristan Tzara introduced Richter to Viking Eggeling and the two experimented together with film. Richter was co-founder, in 1919, of the Association of Revolutionary Artists (Artistes Radicaux) at Z\u00fcrich. In the same year he created his first \"Pr\u00e9lude\": an orchestration of a theme developed in eleven drawings. In 1920, he became a member of the November Group in Berlin and contributed to the Dutch periodical \"De Stijl\".\nThroughout his career, Richter claimed that his 1921 film, \"Rhythmus 21\", was the first abstract film ever created, but in fact it was preceded by the Italian Futurist films by Bruno Corra and Arnaldo Ginna (as they report in the \"Futurist Manifesto of Cinema\"), as well as by fellow German artist Walter Ruttmann, who produced \"Lichtspiel Opus 1\" in 1920. Nevertheless, Richter's film \"Rhythmus 21\" is considered an important early abstract film.\nIn 1933, The Nazis ransacked Richter's studio in Berlin, confiscating or destroying his work. He was stripped of his German citizenship and labelled a degenerate artist and \"cultural Bolshevik\". After attempting, in vain, to make an anti-Nazi film in the Soviet Union in 1931\u20131932, Richter travelled around Europe. He worked for Philips in Holland and made commissioned films in Switzerland. He also gave numerous lectures about film.\nAbout Richter's woodcuts and drawings Michel Seuphor wrote that Richter's black-and-whites graphic work, together with that of Hans Arp and Marcel Janco, are the most typical works of the Z\u00fcrich period of Dada. From 1923 to 1926, Richter edited, together with Werner Gr\u00e4ff and Mies van der Rohe, the periodical \"G. Material zur elementaren Gestaltung.\" Richter wrote of his own attitude toward film:\nI conceive of the film as a modern art form particularly interesting to the sense of sight. Painting has its own peculiar problems and specific sensations, and so has the film. But there are also problems in which the dividing line is obliterated, or where the two infringe upon each other. More especially, the cinema can fulfill certain promises made by the ancient arts, in the realization of which painting and film become close neighbors and work together.\nUnited States.\nRichter moved from Switzerland to the United States in 1940 and became an American citizen. Beginning in 1941 he taught at the Institute of Film Techniques at the City College of New York before taking over as director. While living in New York City, Richter directed two feature films, \"Dreams That Money Can Buy\" (1947) and \"\" (1957) in collaboration with Max Ernst, Jean Cocteau, Paul Bowles, Fernand L\u00e9ger, Alexander Calder, Marcel Duchamp, and others, which was partially filmed on the lawn of his summer house in Southbury, Connecticut. In 1957, he finished a film entitled \"Dadascope\" with original poems and prose spoken by their creators: Hans Arp, Marcel Duchamp, Raoul Hausmann, Richard Huelsenbeck, and Kurt Schwitters. After 1958, Richter spent parts of the year in Ascona and Connecticut and returned to painting. Peggy Guggenheim organized his first solo show in the United States in which his large painted scrolls, inspired by the Second World War, featured prominently. In 1963, he directed the short film \"From the Circus to the Moon\" about the American artist Alexander Calder. In 1965, Richter was also the author of a first-hand account of the Dada movement titled \"Dada: Art and Anti-Art\" which also included his reflections on the emerging Neo-Dada artworks.\nPersonal life.\nHans Richter was married four times: in 1916 to Elisabeth (Lisa, Lies, Lieska) Steinert (\u2020 1923), in 1921 to Maria von Vanselow (divorced 1922), in 1927 to Erna Niemeyer (pseudonyms: Renate Green, R\u00e9 Soupault, Ren\u00e9 Mensch), in 1951 to Frida Ruppel (1910-78), whose two children Hans Ruppel and Ursula Lawder administered the estate.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "42526", "revid": "46390296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42526", "title": "Etching", "text": "Intaglio printmaking technique\nEtching is traditionally the process of using strong acid or mordant to cut into the unprotected parts of a metal surface to create a design in intaglio (incised) in the metal. In modern manufacturing, other chemicals may be used on other types of material. As a method of printmaking, it is, along with engraving, the most important technique for old master prints, and remains in wide use today. In a number of modern variants such as microfabrication etching and photochemical milling, it is a crucial technique in modern technology, including circuit boards.\nIn traditional pure etching, a metal plate (usually of copper, zinc or steel) is covered with a waxy ground which is resistant to acid. The artist then scratches off the ground with a pointed etching needle where the artist wants a line to appear in the finished piece, exposing the bare metal. The \u00e9choppe, a tool with a slanted oval section, is also used for \"swelling\" lines. The plate is then dipped in a bath of acid, known as the \"mordant\" (French for \"biting\") or \"etchant\", or has acid washed over it. The acid \"bites\" into the metal (it undergoes a redox reaction) to a depth depending on time and acid strength, leaving behind the drawing (as carved into the wax) on the metal plate. The remaining ground is then cleaned off the plate. For first and renewed uses the plate is inked in any chosen non-corrosive ink all over and the surface ink drained and wiped clean, leaving ink in the etched forms.\nThe plate is then put through a high-pressure printing press together with a sheet of paper (often moistened to soften it). The paper picks up the ink from the etched lines, making a print. The process can be repeated many times; typically several hundred impressions (copies) could be printed before the plate shows much sign of wear. The work on the plate can be added to or repaired by re-waxing and further etching; such an etching (plate) may have been used in more than one state.\nEtching has often been combined with other intaglio techniques such as engraving (e.g., Rembrandt) or aquatint (e.g., Francisco Goya). The French name \"eau forte\" (lit. \"strong water\") for the technique and the resulting prints was sometimes used in English.\nHistory.\nOrigin.\nEtching in antiquity.\nEtching was already used in antiquity for decorative purposes. Etched carnelian beads are a type of ancient decorative beads made from carnelian with an etched design in white, which were probably manufactured by the Indus Valley civilization during the 3rd millennium BCE. They were made according to a technique of alkaline etching developed by the Harappans, and vast quantities of these beads were found in the archaeological sites of the Indus Valley civilization. They are considered as an important marker of ancient trade between the Indus Valley, Mesopotamia and even Ancient Egypt, as these precious and unique manufactured items circulated in great numbers between these geographical areas during the 3rd millennium BCE, and have been found in numerous tomb deposits. Sumerian kings, such as Shulgi c.\u20092000 BCE, also created etched carnelian beads for dedication purposes.\nEarly etching.\nEtching by goldsmiths and other metal-workers in order to decorate metal items such as guns, armour, cups and plates has been known in Europe since the Middle Ages at least, and may go back to antiquity. The elaborate decoration of armour, in Germany at least, was an art probably imported from Italy around the end of the 15th century\u2014little earlier than the birth of etching as a printmaking technique. Printmakers from the German-speaking lands and Central Europe perfected the art and transmitted their skills over the Alps and across Europe. \nThe process as applied to printmaking is believed to have been invented by Daniel Hopfer (c.\u20091470\u20131536) of Augsburg, Germany. Hopfer was a craftsman who decorated armour in this way, and applied the method to printmaking, using iron plates (many of which still exist). Apart from his prints, there are two proven examples of his work on armour: a shield from 1536 now in the Real Armeria of Madrid and a sword in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum of Nuremberg. An Augsburg horse armour in the German Historical Museum, Berlin, dating to between 1512 and 1515, is decorated with motifs from Hopfer's etchings and woodcuts, but this is no evidence that Hopfer himself worked on it, as his decorative prints were largely produced as patterns for other craftsmen in various media. The oldest dated etching is by Albrecht D\u00fcrer in 1515, although he returned to engraving after six etchings instead of developing the craft.\nThe switch to copper plates was probably made in Italy, and thereafter etching soon came to challenge engraving as the most popular medium for artists in printmaking. Its great advantage was that, unlike engraving where the difficult technique for using the burin requires special skill in metalworking, the basic technique for creating the image on the plate in etching is relatively easy to learn for an artist trained in drawing. On the other hand, the handling of the ground and acid need skill and experience, and are not without health and safety risks, as well as the risk of a ruined plate.\nCallot's innovations: \u00e9choppe, hard ground, stopping-out.\nJacques Callot (1592\u20131635) from Nancy in Lorraine (now part of France) made important technical advances in etching technique.\nCallot also appears to have been responsible for an improved, harder, recipe for the etching ground, using lute-makers' varnish rather than a wax-based formula. This enabled lines to be more deeply bitten, prolonging the life of the plate in printing, and also greatly reducing the risk of \"foul-biting\", where acid gets through the ground to the plate where it is not intended to, producing spots or blotches on the image. Previously the risk of foul-biting had always been at the back of an etcher's mind, preventing too much time on a single plate that risked being ruined in the biting process. Now etchers could do the highly detailed work that was previously the monopoly of engravers, and Callot made full use of the new possibilities.\nCallot also made more extensive and sophisticated use of multiple \"stoppings-out\" than previous etchers had done. This is the technique of letting the acid bite lightly over the whole plate, then stopping-out those parts of the work which the artist wishes to keep light in tone by covering them with ground before bathing the plate in acid again. He achieved unprecedented subtlety in effects of distance and light and shade by careful control of this process. Most of his prints were relatively small\u2014up to about six inches or 15\u00a0cm on their longest dimension, but packed with detail.\nOne of his followers, the Parisian Abraham Bosse, spread Callot's innovations all over Europe with the first published manual of etching, which was translated into Italian, Dutch, German and English.\nThe 17th century was the great age of etching, with Rembrandt, Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione and many other masters. In the 18th century, Piranesi, Tiepolo and Daniel Chodowiecki were the best of a smaller number of fine etchers. In the 19th and early 20th century, the Etching revival produced a host of lesser artists, but no really major figures. Etching is still widely practiced today.\nVariants.\nAquatint uses acid-resistant resin to achieve tonal effects.\nSoft-ground etching uses a special softer ground. The artist places a piece of paper (or cloth etc. in modern uses) over the ground and draws on it. The print resembles a drawing. Soft ground can also be used to capture the texture or pattern of fabrics or furs pressed into the soft surface.\nOther materials that are not manufactured specifically for etching can be used as grounds or resists. Examples including printing ink, paint, spray paint, oil pastels, candle or bees wax, tacky vinyl or stickers, and permanent markers.\nThere are some new non-toxic grounds on the market that work differently than typical hard or soft grounds.\nRelief etching was invented by William Blake in about 1788, and he has been almost the only artist to use it in its original form. However, from 1880 to 1950 a photo-mechanical (\"line-block\") variant was the dominant form of commercial printing for images. A similar process to etching, but printed as a relief print, so it is the \"white\" background areas which are exposed to the acid, and the areas to print \"black\" which are covered with ground. Blake's exact technique remains controversial. He used the technique to print texts and images together, writing the text and drawing lines with an acid-resistant medium.\nCarborundum etching (sometimes called carbograph printing) was invented in the mid-20th century by American artists who worked for the WPA. In this technique, a metal plate is first covered with silicon carbide grit and run through an etching press; then a design is drawn on the roughened plate using an acid-resistant medium. After immersion in an acid bath, the resulting plate is printed as a relief print. The roughened surface of the relief permits considerable tonal range, and it is possible to attain a high relief that results in strongly embossed prints.\nPrintmaking technique in detail.\nA waxy acid-resist, known as a ground, is applied to a metal plate, most often copper or zinc but steel plate is another medium with different qualities. There are two common types of ground: hard ground and soft ground.\nHard ground can be applied in two ways. Solid hard ground comes in a hard waxy block. To apply hard ground of this variety, the plate to be etched is placed upon a hot-plate (set at 70\u00a0\u00b0C, 158\u00a0\u00b0F), a kind of metal worktop that is heated up. The plate heats up and the ground is applied by hand, melting onto the plate as it is applied. The ground is spread over the plate as evenly as possible using a roller. Once applied the etching plate is removed from the hot-plate and allowed to cool which hardens the ground.\nAfter the ground has hardened the artist \"smokes\" the plate, classically with 3 beeswax tapers, applying the flame to the plate to darken the ground and make it easier to see what parts of the plate are exposed. Smoking not only darkens the plate but adds a small amount of wax. Afterwards the artist uses a sharp tool to scratch into the ground, exposing the metal.\nThe second way to apply hard ground is by liquid hard ground. This comes in a can and is applied with a brush upon the plate to be etched. Exposed to air the hard ground will harden. Some printmakers use\noil/tar based asphaltum or bitumen as hard ground, although often bitumen is used to protect steel plates from rust and copper plates from aging.\nSoft ground also comes in liquid form and is allowed to dry but it does not dry hard like hard ground and is impressionable. After the soft ground has dried the printmaker may apply materials such as leaves, objects, hand prints and so on which will penetrate the soft ground and expose the plate underneath.\nThe ground can also be applied in a fine mist, using powdered rosin or spraypaint. This process is called aquatint, and allows for the creation of tones, shadows, and solid areas of color.\nThe design is then drawn (in reverse) with an etching-needle or \u00e9choppe. An \"echoppe\" point can be made from an ordinary tempered steel etching needle, by grinding the point back on a carborundum stone, at a 45\u201360 degree angle. The \"echoppe\" works on the same principle that makes a fountain pen's line more attractive than a ballpoint's: The slight swelling variation caused by the natural movement of the hand \"warms up\" the line, and although hardly noticeable in any individual line, has a very attractive overall effect on the finished plate. It can be drawn with in the same way as an ordinary needle.\nThe plate is then completely submerged in a solution that eats away at the exposed metal. ferric chloride may be used for etching copper or zinc plates, whereas nitric acid may be used for etching zinc or steel plates. Typical solutions are 1 part FeCl3 to 1 part water and 1 part nitric to 3 parts water. The strength of the acid determines the speed of the etching process.\nDuring the etching process the printmaker uses a bird feather or similar item to wave away bubbles and detritus produced by the dissolving process, from the surface of the plate, or the plate may be periodically lifted from the acid bath. If a bubble is allowed to remain on the plate then it will stop the acid biting into the plate where the bubble touches it. Zinc produces more bubbles much more rapidly than copper and steel and some artists use this to produce interesting round bubble-like circles within their prints for a Milky Way effect.\nThe detritus is powdery dissolved metal that fills the etched grooves and can also block the acid from biting evenly into the exposed plate surfaces. Another way to remove detritus from a plate is to place the plate to be etched face down within the acid upon plasticine balls or marbles, although the drawback of this technique is the exposure to bubbles and the inability to remove them readily.\nFor aquatinting a printmaker will often use a test strip of metal about a centimetre to three centimetres wide. The strip will be dipped into the acid for a specific number of minutes or seconds. The metal strip will then be removed and the acid washed off with water. Part of the strip will be covered in ground and then the strip is redipped into the acid and the process repeated. The ground will then be removed from the strip and the strip inked up and printed. This will show the printmaker the different degrees or depths of the etch, and therefore the strength of the ink color, based upon how long the plate is left in the acid.\nThe plate is removed from the acid and washed over with water to remove the acid. The ground is removed with a solvent such as turpentine. Turpentine is often removed from the plate using methylated spirits since turpentine is greasy and can affect the application of ink and the printing of the plate.\nSpit-biting is a process whereby the printmaker will apply acid to a plate with a brush in certain areas of the plate. The plate may be aquatinted for this purpose or exposed directly to the acid. The process is known as \"spit\"-biting due to the use of saliva once used as a medium to dilute the acid, although gum arabic or water are now commonly used.\nA piece of matte board, a plastic \"card\", or a wad of cloth is often used to push the ink into the incised lines. The surface is wiped clean with a piece of stiff fabric known as \"tarlatan\" and then wiped with newsprint paper; some printmakers prefer to use the blade part of their hand or palm at the base of their thumb. The wiping leaves ink in the incisions. You may also use a folded piece of organza silk to do the final wipe. If copper or zinc plates are used, then the plate surface is left very clean and therefore white in the print. If steel plate is used, then the plate's natural tooth gives the print a grey background similar to the effects of aquatinting. As a result, steel plates do not need aquatinting as gradual exposure of the plate via successive dips into acid will produce the same result.\nA damp piece of paper is placed over the plate and it is run through the press.\nNontoxic etching.\nGrowing concerns about the health effects of acids and solvents led to the development of less toxic etching methods in the late 20th century. An early innovation was the use of floor wax as a hard ground for coating the plate. Others, such as printmakers Mark Zaffron and Keith Howard, developed systems using acrylic polymers as a ground and ferric chloride for etching. The polymers are removed with sodium carbonate (washing soda) solution, rather than solvents. When used for etching, ferric chloride does not produce a corrosive gas, as acids do, thus eliminating another danger of traditional etching.\nThe traditional aquatint, which uses either powdered rosin or enamel spray paint, is replaced with an airbrush application of the acrylic polymer hard ground. Again, no solvents are needed beyond the soda ash solution, though a ventilation hood is needed due to acrylic particulates from the air brush spray.\nThe traditional soft ground, requiring solvents for removal from the plate, is replaced with water-based relief printing ink. The ink receives impressions like traditional soft ground, resists the ferric chloride etchant, yet can be cleaned up with warm water and either soda ash solution or ammonia.\nAnodic etching has been used in industrial processes for over a century. The etching power is a source of direct current. The item to be etched (anode) is connected to its positive pole. A receiver plate (cathode) is connected to its negative pole. Both, spaced slightly apart, are immersed in a suitable aqueous solution of a suitable electrolyte. The current pushes the metal out from the anode into solution and deposits it as metal on the cathode. Shortly before 1990, two groups working independently developed different ways of applying it to creating intaglio printing plates.\nIn the patented Electroetch system, invented by Marion and Omri Behr, in contrast to certain nontoxic etching methods, an etched plate can be reworked as often as the artist desires The system uses voltages below 2 volts which exposes the uneven metal crystals in the etched areas resulting in superior ink retention and printed image appearance of quality equivalent to traditional acid methods. With polarity reversed the low voltage provides a simpler method of making mezzotint plates as well as the \"steel facing\" copper plates.\nSome of the earliest printmaking workshops experimenting with, developing and promoting nontoxic techniques include Grafisk Eksperimentarium, in Copenhagen, Denmark, Edinburgh Printmakers, in Scotland, and New Grounds Print Workshop, in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\nPhoto-etching.\nLight sensitive polymer plates allow for photorealistic etchings. A photo-sensitive coating is applied to the plate by either the plate supplier or the artist. Light is projected onto the plate as a negative image to expose it. Photopolymer plates are either washed in hot water or under other chemicals according to the plate manufacturers' instructions. Areas of the photo-etch image may be stopped-out before etching to exclude them from the final image on the plate, or removed or lightened by scraping and burnishing once the plate has been etched. Once the photo-etching process is complete, the plate can be worked further as a normal intaglio plate, using drypoint, further etching, engraving, etc. The final result is an intaglio plate which is printed like any other.\nTypes of metal plates.\nCopper is a traditional metal, and is still preferred, for etching, as it bites evenly, holds texture well, and does not distort the color of the ink when wiped. Zinc is cheaper than copper, so preferable for beginners, but it does not bite as cleanly as copper does, and it alters some colors of ink. Steel is growing in popularity as an etching substrate. Increases in the prices of copper and zinc have steered steel to an acceptable alternative. The line quality of steel is less fine than copper, but finer than zinc. Steel has a natural and rich aquatint.\nThe type of metal used for the plate impacts the number of prints the plate will produce. The firm pressure of the printing press slowly rubs out the finer details of the image with every pass-through. With relatively soft copper, for example, the etching details will begin to wear very quickly, some copper plates show extreme wear after only ten prints. Steel, on the other hand, is incredibly durable. This wearing out of the image over time is one of the reasons etched prints created early in a numbered series tend to be valued more highly. An artist thus takes the total number of prints he or she wishes to produce into account whenever choosing the metal.\nIndustrial uses.\nEtching is also used in the manufacturing of printed circuit boards and semiconductor devices, and in the preparation of metallic specimens for microscopic observation.\nPrior to 1100\u00a0AD, the New World Hohokam culture independently utilized the technique of acid etching in marine shell designs. The shells were daubed in pitch and then bathed in acid probably made from fermented cactus juice.\nMetallographic etching.\nMetallographic etching is a method of preparing samples of metal for analysis. It can be applied after polishing to further reveal microstructural features (such as grain size, distribution of phases, and inclusions), along with other aspects such as prior mechanical deformation or thermal treatments. Metal can be etched using chemicals, electrolysis, or heat (thermal etching).\nControlling the acid's effects.\nThere are many ways for the printmaker to control the acid's effects.\nHard grounds.\nMost typically, the surface of the plate is covered in a hard, waxy 'ground' that resists acid. The printmaker then scratches through the ground with a sharp point, exposing lines of metal which the mordant acid attacks.\nAquatint.\nAquatint is a variation giving only tone rather than lines when printed. Particulate resin is evenly distributed on all or parts of the plate, then heated to form a screen ground of uniform, but less than perfect, density. After etching, any exposed surface will result in a roughened (i.e., darkened) surface. Areas that are to be light in the final print are protected by varnishing between acid baths. Successive turns of varnishing and placing the plate in acid create areas of tone difficult or impossible to achieve by drawing through a wax ground.\nSugar lift.\nDesigns in a syrupy solution of sugar or Camp Coffee are painted onto the metal surface prior to it being coated in a liquid etching ground or 'stop out' varnish. When the plate is placed in hot water the sugar dissolves, leaving the image. The plate can then be etched.\nSpit bite.\nA mixture of nitric acid and gum arabic (or, very rarely, saliva) which can be dripped, spattered or painted onto a metal surface giving interesting results. A mixture of nitric acid and rosin may also be used.\nPrinting.\n Printing the plate is done by covering the surface with printing ink, then rubbing the ink off the surface with \"tarlatan\" cloth or newsprint, leaving ink in the roughened areas and lines. Damp paper is placed on the plate, and both are run through a printing press; the pressure forces the paper into contact with the ink, transferring the image (\"cf.\", chine-coll\u00e9). The pressure subtly degrades the image in the plate, smoothing the roughened areas and closing the lines; a copper plate is good for, at most, a few hundred printings of a strongly etched imaged before the degradation is considered too great by the artist. At that point, the artist can manually restore the plate by re-etching it, essentially putting ground back on and retracing their lines; alternatively, plates can be electro-plated before printing with a harder metal to preserve the surface. Zinc is also used, because as a softer metal, etching times are shorter; however, that softness also leads to faster degradation of the image in the press.\nFaults.\n\"Foul-bite\" or \"over-biting\" is common in etching, and is the effect of minuscule amounts of acid leaking through the ground to create minor pitting and burning on the surface. This incidental roughening may be removed by smoothing and polishing the surface, but artists often leave faux-bite, or deliberately court it by handling the plate roughly, because it is viewed as a desirable mark of the process.\n\"Etchings\" euphemism.\nThe phrase \"Want to come up and see my etchings?\" is a romantic euphemism by which a person entices someone to come back to their place with an offer to look at something artistic, but with ulterior motives. The phrase is a corruption of some phrases in a novel by Horatio Alger Jr. called \"The Erie Train Boy\", which was first published in 1891. Alger was an immensely popular author in the 19th century\u2014especially with young people\u2014and his books were widely quoted. In chapter XXII of the book, a woman writes to her boyfriend, \"I have a new collection of etchings that I want to show you. Won't you name an evening when you will call, as I want to be certain to be at home when you really do come.\" The boyfriend then writes back \"I shall no doubt find pleasure in examining the etchings which you hold out as an inducement to call.\"\nThis was referenced in a 1929 James Thurber cartoon in which a man tells a woman in a building lobby: \"You wait here and I'll bring the etchings down\". It was also referenced in Dashiell Hammett's 1934 novel \"The Thin Man\", in which the narrator answers his wife asking him about a lady he had wandered off with by saying: \"She just wanted to show me some French etchings.\"\nThe phrase was given new popularity in 1937: in a well publicized case, violinist David Rubinoff was accused of inviting a young woman to his hotel room to view some French etchings, but instead seducing her.\nAs early as 1895, Hjalmar S\u00f6derberg used the reference in his \"decadent\" d\u00e9but novel \"Delusions\" (swe: \"F\u00f6rvillelser)\", when he lets the dandy Johannes Hall lure the main character's younger sister Greta into his room under the pretence that they browse through his etchings and engravings (e.g., \"Die S\u00fcnde\" by Franz Stuck).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "42528", "revid": "48736052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42528", "title": "Screen printing", "text": "Printing technique\nScreen printing is a printing technique where a mesh is used to transfer ink (or dye) onto a substrate, except in areas made impermeable to the ink by a blocking stencil. A blade or squeegee is moved across the screen in a \"flood stroke\" to fill the open mesh apertures with ink, and a reverse stroke then causes the screen to touch the substrate momentarily along a line of contact. This causes the ink to wet the substrate and be pulled out of the mesh apertures as the screen springs back after the blade has passed. One colour is printed at a time, so several screens can be used to produce a multi-coloured image or design.\nTraditionally, silk was used in the process. Currently, synthetic threads are commonly used. The most popular mesh in general use is made of polyester. There are special-use mesh materials of nylon and stainless steel available to the screen-printer. There are also different types of mesh size which will determine the outcome and look of the finished design on the material.\nThe technique is used not only for garment printing but for printing on many other substances, including decals, clock and watch faces, balloons, and many other products. Advanced uses include laying down conductors and resistors in multi-layer circuits using thin ceramic layers as the substrate.\nHistory.\nOrigin.\nScreen Printing takes its origin from block printing which originated in China, which was the influence for Japanese . Early records of Japanese stencils in the west indicate the art was introduced around 1873, which lines up with development of screen printing as it is known today.\nAdoption in the West.\nScreen printing was largely introduced to Western Europe from Asia sometime in the late 18th century, but did not gain large acceptance or use in Europe until silk mesh was more available for trade from the east and a profitable outlet for the medium discovered.\nEarly in the 1910s, several printers experimenting with photo-reactive chemicals used the well-known actinic light\u2013activated cross linking or hardening traits of potassium, sodium or ammonium chromate and dichromate chemicals with glues and gelatin compounds. Roy Beck, Charles Peter and Edward Owens studied and experimented with chromic acid salt sensitized emulsions for photo-reactive stencils. This trio of developers would prove to revolutionize the commercial screen printing industry by introducing photo-imaged stencils to the industry, though the acceptance of this method would take many years. Commercial screen printing now uses sensitizers far safer and less toxic than bichromates. Currently, there are large selections of pre-sensitized and \"user mixed\" sensitized emulsion chemicals for creating photo-reactive stencils.\nA group of artists who later formed the National Serigraph Society, including WPA artists Max Arthur Cohn, Anthony Velonis and Hyman Warsager, coined the word \"serigraphy\" in the 1930s to differentiate the artistic application of screen printing from the industrial use of the process. \"Serigraphy\" is a compound word formed from Latin \"s\u0113ricum\" (silk) and Greek \"graphein\" (to write or draw).\nHistorians of the New York WPA poster shop give sole credit to Anthony Velonis for establishing silkscreen methods used there, a reputation bolstered by the publication of his 1937 booklet \"Technical Problems of the Artist: Technique of the Silkscreen Process.\" Guido Lengweiler has corrected this misunderstanding in his book, \"A History of Screen Printing\", published in English in 2016. Outgrowths of these WPA poster shops, at least two New York City studios in wartime started decorating ceramic tiles with fire-on underglaze applied by silkscreen starting as early as 1939: Esteban Soriano and Harold Ambellan's workshop called Designed Tiles.\nThe Printers' National Environmental Assistance Center says, \"Screenprinting is arguably the most versatile of all printing processes. Since rudimentary screenprinting materials are so affordable and readily available, it has been used frequently in underground settings and subcultures, and the non-professional look of such DIY culture screenprints have become a significant cultural aesthetic seen on movie posters, record album covers, flyers, shirts, commercial fonts in advertising, in artwork and elsewhere.\n1960s to present.\nCredit is given to the artist Andy Warhol for popularising screen printing as an artistic technique. Warhol's silk screens include his 1962 Marilyn Diptych, which is a portrait of the actress Marilyn Monroe printed in bold colours. Warhol was supported in his production by master screen printer Michel Caza, a founding member of Fespa.\nSister Mary Corita Kent gained international fame for her vibrant serigraphs during the 1960s and 1970s. Her works were rainbow coloured, contained words that were both political, and fostered peace and love and caring.\nAmerican entrepreneur, artist and inventor Michael Vasilantone started to use, develop, and sell a rotatable multicolour garment screen printing machine in 1960. Vasilantone later filed for a patent on his invention in 1967 granted number 3,427,964 on 18 February 1969. The original machine was manufactured to print logos and team information on bowling garments, but was soon directed to the new fad of printing on T-shirts. The Vasilantone patent was licensed by multiple manufacturers and the resulting production and boom in printed T-shirts made this \"garment\" screen printing machine popular. Screen printing on garments currently accounts for over half of the screen printing activity in the United States.\nGraphic screen-printing is widely used today to create mass- or large-batch produced graphics, such as posters or display stands. Full colour prints can be created by printing in CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow and black).\nScreen printing lends itself well to printing on canvas. Andy Warhol, Arthur Okamura, Robert Rauschenberg, Roy Lichtenstein, Harry Gottlieb and many other artists have used screen printing as an expression of creativity and artistic vision.\nAnother variation, digital hybrid screen printing, is a union between analog screen printing and traditional digital direct-to-garment printing, two of the most common textile embellishment technologies in use today. Essentially, digital hybrid screen printing is an automatic screen-printing press with a CMYK digital enhancement located on one of the screen print stations. Digital hybrid screen printing is capable of variable data options, creating endless customizations, with the added ability of screen print specific techniques.\nMethod.\nA screen is made of a piece of mesh stretched over a frame. The mesh could be made of a synthetic polymer, such as nylon, and a finer and smaller aperture for the mesh would be utilized for a design that requires a higher and more delicate degree of detail. For the mesh to be effective, it must be mounted on a frame and it must be under tension. The frame which holds the mesh could be made of diverse materials, such as wood, metal, or aluminum, depending on the sophistication of the machine or the artisan procedure. The tension of the mesh may be checked by using a tensiometer; a common unit for the measurement of the tension of the mesh is Newton per centimeter (N/cm).\nA stencil is formed by blocking off parts of the screen in the negative image of the design to be printed; that is, the open spaces are where the ink will appear on the substrate.\nBefore printing occurs, the frame and screen must undergo the pre-press process, in which an emulsion is 'scooped' across the mesh. Once this emulsion has dried, it is selectively exposed to ultra-violet light, through a film printed with the required design. This hardens the emulsion in the exposed areas but leaves the unexposed parts soft. They are then washed away using a water spray, leaving behind a clean area in the mesh with the identical shape as the desired image, which will allow passage of ink. It is a positive process.\nIn fabric printing, the surface supporting the fabric to be printed (commonly referred to as a pallet) is coated with a wide 'pallet tape'. This serves to protect the 'pallet' from any unwanted ink leaking through the screen and potentially staining the 'pallet' or transferring unwanted ink onto the next substrate. The pallet tape is also used to protect the pallet from the usage of glue that keeps the substrate adhered and in place on the pallet. Over time the pallet tape will become covered with lint which it then can be removed, discarded, and replaced by new pallet tape.\nNext, the screen and frame are lined with a tape to prevent ink from reaching the edge of the screen and the frame. The type of tape used in for this purpose often depends upon the ink that is to be printed onto the substrate. More aggressive tapes are generally used for UV and water-based inks due to the inks' lower viscosities and greater tendency to creep underneath tape.\nThe last process in the 'pre-press' is blocking out any unwanted 'pin-holes' in the emulsion. If these holes are left in the emulsion, the ink will continue through and leave unwanted marks. To block out these holes, materials such as tapes, speciality emulsions and 'block-out pens' may be used effectively.\nThe screen is placed atop a substrate. Ink is placed on top of the screen, and a floodbar is used to push the ink through the holes in the mesh. The operator begins with the fill bar at the rear of the screen and behind a reservoir of ink. The operator lifts the screen to prevent contact with the substrate and then using a slight amount of downward force pulls the fill bar to the front of the screen. This effectively fills the mesh openings with ink and moves the ink reservoir to the front of the screen. The operator then uses a squeegee (rubber blade) to move the mesh down to the substrate and pushes the squeegee to the rear of the screen. The ink that is in the mesh opening is pumped or squeezed by capillary action to the substrate in a controlled and prescribed amount, i.e. the wet ink deposit is proportional to the thickness of the mesh and or stencil. As the squeegee moves toward the rear of the screen the tension of the mesh pulls the mesh up away from the substrate (called snap-off) leaving the ink upon the substrate surface.\nThere are three common types of screen printing presses: flat-bed, cylinder, and rotary. A development of screen printing with flat screens from 1963 was to wrap the screen around to form a tube, with the ink supply and squeegee inside the tube. The resulting roller rotates at the same speed as the web in a roll-to-roll machine. The benefits are high output rates and long rolls of product. This is the only way to make high-build fully patterned printing/coating as a continuous process, and has been widely used for manufacturing textured wallpapers.\nTextile items printed with multi-coloured designs often use a wet on wet technique, or colours dried while on the press, while graphic items are allowed to dry between colours that are then printed with another screen and often in a different colour after the product is re-aligned on the press.\nMost screens are ready for re-coating at this stage, but sometimes screens will have to undergo a further step in the reclaiming process called de-hazing. This additional step removes haze or \"ghost images\" left behind in the screen once the emulsion has been removed. Ghost images tend to faintly outline the open areas of previous stencils, hence the name. They are the result of ink residue trapped in the mesh, often in the knuckles of the mesh (the points where threads cross). A properly cleaned screen will not have any residual traces of the previous image apparent on its surface.\nStencils.\nA method of stenciling that has increased in popularity over the past years is the photo emulsion technique:\nNon-garment uses.\nScreen printing is more versatile than traditional printing techniques. The surface does not have to be printed under pressure, unlike etching or lithography, and it does not have to be planar. Different inks can be used to work with a variety of materials, such as textiles, ceramics, wood, paper, glass, metal, and plastic. As a result, screen printing is used in many different industries, including:\nIn screen printing on wafer-based solar photovoltaic (PV) cells, the mesh and buses of silver are printed on the front; furthermore, the buses of silver are printed on the back. Subsequently, aluminum paste is dispensed over the whole surface of the back for passivation and surface reflection. One of the parameters that can vary and can be controlled in screen printing is the thickness of the print. This makes it useful for some of the techniques of printing solar cells, electronics etc.\nSolar wafers are becoming thinner and larger, so careful printing is required to maintain a lower breakage rate, though high throughput at the printing stage improves the throughput of the whole cell production line.\nAutomation.\nTo print multiple copies of the screen design on garments in an efficient manner, amateur and professional printers usually use a screen printing press, which is a colloquial term as most screen printing machines are vastly different from offset printing presses. Many companies offer simple to sophisticated printing presses. These presses come in one of three types, manual (also referred to as handbench), semi-automatic, and fully automatic. Most printing companies will use one or more semi-automatic or fully automatic machines with manual machines for small runs and sampling.\nWhilst manual screen printing can be done with carousels, handbenches (both of which are often referred to colloquially as presses) or even on to tables. Semi- and fully-automatic machines are broken into two main categories; flatbed printers (poster, art printing or other flat substrates) and carousels and oval machines (garments and other apparel, amongst other textiles). Both which are fundamentally similar in terms of automation but differ in areas such as physical footprint and upgrade paths.\nThese machines are much faster and use either pneumatic pressure generated by air compressors or use electric motors to draw the squeegees, rotate and raise or lower pallets removing much of the manual labour from the task and use UV for instant image curing - resulting in significant reductions in operator fatigue as well as more consistent results.\nPrinted circuit boards (PCB).\nIn electronic design automation, the silk screen is part of the layer stack of the printed circuit board (PCB), and the top and bottom sides are described in individual Gerber files like any other layers (such as the copper and solder-stop layers). Typical names for these \"service print overlays\" include codice_1/codice_2 aka codice_3/codice_4 or codice_5/codice_6 (EAGLE), codice_7/codice_8 (KiCad), codice_9/codice_10 (TARGET), codice_11/codice_12 (Fritzing), codice_13/codice_14 (OrCAD), codice_15/codice_16 (PADS), codice_17/codice_18 (WEdirekt) or codice_19/codice_20 (Gerber and many others).\nPrinted electronics.\nScreen printing, a widely adopted technique in the printing industry, has found its niche in the realm of printed electronics. Its versatility and ability to deposit thick layers of inks make it ideal for creating conductive tracks, sensors, and other electronic components. Furthermore, screen printing offers advantages such as high throughput, low production costs, and compatibility with a wide range of substrates, including flexible materials. These attributes make it a preferred choice for large-scale production of printed electronic devices.\nWhile screen printing offers tremendous potential in printed electronics, it also faces certain challenges. Fine-line resolution, compatibility with advanced materials, and the need for precise registration pose ongoing research and development opportunities. However, continuous advancements in ink formulations, equipment, and process optimization are paving the way for exciting future possibilities, including the integration of printed electronics into Internet of Things (IoT) devices, energy harvesting systems, and more.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Common types of matrices include: metal plates for engraving, etching and related intaglio printing techniques; stone, aluminum, or polymer for lithography; blocks of wood for woodcuts and wood engravings; and linoleum for linocuts. Screens made of silk or synthetic fabrics are used for the screen printing process. Other types of matrix substrates and related processes are discussed below.\nExcept in the case of monotyping, all printmaking processes have the capacity to produce identical multiples of the same artwork, which is called a print. Each print produced is considered an \"original\" work of art, and is correctly referred to as an \"impression\", not a \"copy\" (that means a different print copying the first, common in early printmaking). However, impressions can vary considerably, whether intentionally or not. Master printmakers are technicians who are capable of printing identical \"impressions\" by hand. A print that copies another work of art, especially a painting, is known as a \"reproductive print\".\nMultiple impressions printed from the same matrix form an edition. Since the late 19th century, artists have generally signed individual impressions from an edition and often number the impressions to form a limited edition; the matrix is then destroyed so that no more prints can be produced. Prints may also be printed in book form, such as illustrated books or artist's books.\nTechniques.\nOverview.\nPrintmaking techniques are generally divided into the following basic categories:\nTypes of printmaking outside of this group are viscosity printing, water surface printing such as paper marbling, . Contemporary printmaking may include digital printing, photographic mediums, or a combination of digital, photographic, and traditional processes.\nMany of these techniques can also be combined, especially within the same family. For example, Rembrandt's prints are usually referred to as \"etchings\" for convenience, but very often include work in engraving and drypoint as well, and sometimes have no etching at all.\nWoodcut.\nArtists using this technique include\nAlbrecht D\u00fcrer,\nHans Burgkmair,\nUgo da Carpi,\nHiroshige,\nHokusai,\nFrans Masereel,\nGustave Baumann, \nErnst Ludwig Kirchner,\nEric Slater,\nAntonio Frasconi\nWoodcut, a type of relief print, is the earliest printmaking technique. It was probably first developed as a means of printing patterns on cloth, and by the 5th century was used in China for printing text and images on paper. Woodcuts of images on paper developed around 1400 in Europe, and slightly later in Japan. These are the two areas where woodcut has been most extensively used purely as a process for making images without text. \nThe artist either draws a design directly on a plank of wood, or transfers a drawing done on paper to a plank of wood. Traditionally, the artist then handed the work to a technician, who then uses sharp carving tools to carve away the parts of the block that will not receive ink. In the Western tradition, the surface of the block is then inked with the use of a brayer; however in the Japanese tradition, woodblocks were inked with a brush. Then a sheet of paper, perhaps slightly damp, is placed over the block. The block is then rubbed with a baren or spoon, or is run through a printing press. If the print is in color, separate blocks can be used for each color, or a technique called reduction printing can be used.\nReduction printing is a name used to describe the process of using one block to print several layers of color on one print. Both woodcuts and linocuts can employ reduction printing. This usually involves cutting a small amount of the block away, and then printing the block many times over on different sheets before washing the block, cutting more away and printing the next color on top. This allows the previous color to show through. This process can be repeated many times over. The advantages of this process is that only one block is needed, and that different components of an intricate design will line up perfectly. The disadvantage is that once the artist moves on to the next layer, no more prints can be made.\nAnother variation of woodcut printmaking is the cukil technique, made famous by the Taring Padi underground community in Java, Indonesia. Taring Padi Posters usually resemble intricately printed cartoon posters embedded with political messages. Images\u2014usually resembling a visually complex scenario\u2014are carved unto a wooden surface called cukilan, then smothered with printer's ink before pressing it unto media such as paper or canvas.\nEngraving.\nThe process was developed in Germany in the 1430s from the engraving used by goldsmiths to decorate metalwork. Engravers use a hardened steel tool called a burin to cut the design into the surface of a metal plate, traditionally made of copper. Engraving using a burin is generally a difficult skill to learn.\nGravers come in a variety of shapes and sizes that yield different line types. The burin produces a unique and recognizable quality of line that is characterized by its steady, deliberate appearance and clean edges. Other tools such as mezzotint rockers, roulettes (a tool with a fine-toothed wheel) and burnishers (a tool used for making an object smooth or shiny by rubbing) are used for texturing effects.\nTo make a print, the engraved plate is inked all over, then the ink is wiped off the surface, leaving ink only in the engraved lines. The plate is then put through a high-pressure printing press together with a sheet of paper (often moistened to soften it). The paper picks up the ink from the engraved lines, making a print. The process can be repeated many times; typically several hundred impressions (copies) could be printed before the printing plate shows much sign of wear, except when drypoint, which gives much shallower lines, is used.\nIn the 20th century, true engraving was revived as a serious art form by artists including Stanley William Hayter whose Atelier 17 in Paris and New York City became the magnet for such artists as Pablo Picasso, Alberto Giacometti, Mauricio Lasansky and Joan Mir\u00f3.\nEtching.\nArtists using this technique include\nAlbrecht D\u00fcrer,\nRembrandt,\nFrancisco Goya,\nWenceslaus Hollar,\nWhistler,\nOtto Dix,\nJames Ensor,\nEdward Hopper,\nK\u00e4the Kollwitz,\nPablo Picasso,\nCy Twombly,\nLucas van Leyden\nEtching is part of the intaglio family. In pure etching, a metal plate (usually copper, zinc, or steel) is covered with a waxy or acrylic ground. The artist then draws through the ground with a pointed etching needle, exposing the metal. The plate is then etched by dipping it in a bath of etchant (e.g. nitric acid or ferric chloride). The etchant \"bites\" into the exposed metal, leaving behind lines in the plate. The remaining ground is then cleaned off the plate, and the printing process is then just the same as for engraving.\nAlthough the first dated etching is by Albrecht D\u00fcrer in 1515, the process is believed to have been invented by Daniel Hopfer (c.\u20091470\u20131536) of Augsburg, Germany, who decorated armor in this way, and applied the method to printmaking. Etching soon came to challenge engraving as the most popular printmaking medium. Its great advantage was that, unlike engraving which requires special skill in metalworking, etching is relatively easy to learn for an artist trained in drawing.\nEtching prints are generally linear and often contain fine detail and contours. Lines can vary from smooth to sketchy. An etching is opposite of a woodcut in that the raised portions of an etching remain blank while the crevices hold ink.\nA non-toxic form of etching that does not involve an acid is Electroetching.\nMezzotint.\nArtists using this technique include\nJohn Martin,\nLudwig von Siegen,\nJohn Smith,\nWallerant Vaillant,\nCarol Wax\nAn intaglio variant of engraving in which the image is formed from subtle gradations of light and shade. Mezzotint\u2014from the Italian mezzo (\"half\") and tinta (\"tone\")\u2014is a \"dark manner\" form of printmaking, which requires artists to work from dark to light. To create a mezzotint, the surface of a copper printing plate is roughened evenly all over with the aid of a tool known as a rocker; the image is then formed by smoothing the surface with a tool known as a burnisher. When inked, the roughened areas of the plate will hold more ink and print more darkly, while smoother areas of the plate hold less or no ink, and will print more lightly or not at all. It is, however, possible to create the image by only roughening the plate selectively, so working from light to dark.\nMezzotint is known for the luxurious quality of its tones: first, because an evenly, finely roughened surface holds a lot of ink, allowing deep solid colors to be printed; secondly because the process of smoothing the texture with burin, burnisher and scraper allows fine gradations in tone to be developed.\nThe mezzotint printmaking method was invented by Ludwig von Siegen (1609\u20131680). The process was used widely in England from the mid-eighteenth century, to reproduce oil paintings and in particular portraits.\nAquatint.\nArtists using this technique include\nFrancisco Goya,\nThomas Rowlandson,\nJean-Baptiste Le Prince,\nWilliam Daniell,\nNorman Ackroyd\nA tonal technique typically used in conjunction with Intaglio techniques, especially etching, and printed in the same way. Like etching, aquatint technique involves the application of acid to make marks in a metal plate. Where the etching technique uses a needle to make lines that retain ink, traditional aquatint relies on powdered rosin which is acid resistant in the ground to create a tonal effect. The rosin is applied in a light dusting by a fan booth, the rosin is then cooked until set on the plate. At this time the rosin can be burnished or scratched out to affect its tonal qualities. The plate is then exposed to acid, to which the rosin particles are resistant, and tonal variation is controlled by the level of acid exposure over large areas, and thus the image is shaped by large sections at a time. Very often it is combined with conventional etching. Printing gradually wears away the rosin grain, and many fewer impressions can be printed than in the traditional intaglio techniques before the tonal contrasts weaken, perhaps only 100. The popularity of the technique in the 19th century, combined with this weakness, probably played a role in the rise of the limited edition print. \nContemporary printmakers also sometimes using airbrushed asphaltum or spray paint, as well as other non toxic techniques, to achieve aquatint due to rosin boxes posing a fire hazard.\nGoya used aquatint for most of his prints. After his death, later printings wore away the aquatint grain almost completely, leaving only the etched lines and faint tonal shadows.\nDrypoint.\nArtists using this technique include\nMary Cassatt,\nFrancis Seymour Haden,\nMaster of the Housebook,\nRichard Spare,\nWilliam Lionel Wyllie\nA variant of engraving, done with a sharp point, rather than a v-shaped burin. While engraved lines are very smooth and hard-edged, drypoint scratching leaves a rough burr at the edges of each line. This burr gives drypoint prints a characteristically soft, and sometimes blurry, line quality. Because the pressure of printing quickly destroys the burr, drypoint is useful only for very small editions; as few as ten or twenty impressions. To counter this, and allow for longer print runs, electro-plating (here called steelfacing) has been used since the nineteenth century to harden the surface of a plate.\nThe technique appears to have been invented by the Housebook Master, a south German fifteenth-century artist, all of whose prints are in drypoint only. Among the most famous artists of the old master print, Albrecht D\u00fcrer produced three drypoints before abandoning the technique; Rembrandt used it frequently, but usually in conjunction with etching and engraving.\nLithography.\nArtists using this technique include\nHonor\u00e9 Daumier,\nVincent van Gogh,\nGeorge Bellows,\nPierre Bonnard,\nEdvard Munch,\nEmil Nolde,\nPablo Picasso,\nOdilon Redon,\nHenri de Toulouse-Lautrec,\nSalvador Dal\u00ed,\nM. C. Escher,\nWillem de Kooning,\nJoan Mir\u00f3,\nStow Wengenroth,\nElaine de Kooning,\nLouise Nevelson\nLithography is a technique invented in 1798 by Alois Senefelder and based on the chemical repulsion of oil and water.\nA porous surface, normally limestone, is used; the image is drawn on the limestone with a greasy medium.\nAcid is applied, transferring the grease-protected design to the limestone, leaving the image 'burned' into the surface. Gum arabic, a water-soluble substance, is then applied, sealing the surface of the stone not covered with the drawing medium.\nThe stone is wetted, with water staying only on the surface not covered in grease-based residue of the drawing; the stone is then 'rolled up', meaning oil ink is applied with a roller covering the entire surface; since water repels the oil in the ink, the ink adheres only to the greasy parts, perfectly inking the image.\nA sheet of dry paper is placed on the surface, and the image is transferred to the paper by the pressure of the printing press. Lithography is known for its ability to capture fine gradations in shading and very small detail.\nVariations of Lithography.\nPhoto-lithography captures an image by photographic processes on metal plates; printing is more or less carried out in the same way as stone lithography.\nHalftone lithography produces an image that illustrates a gradient-like quality.\nMokulito is a form of lithography on wood instead of limestone. It was invented by Seishi Ozaku in the 1970s in Japan and was originally called Mokurito.\nScreenprinting.\nArtists using this technique include\nJosef Albers,\nRalston Crawford,\nGene Davis.\nRobert Indiana,\nRoy Lichtenstein,\nJulian Opie,\nBridget Riley,\nEdward Ruscha,\nAndy Warhol.\nScreen printing (occasionally known as \"silkscreen\", or \"serigraphy\") creates prints by using a fabric stencil technique; ink is simply pushed through the stencil against the surface of the paper, most often with the aid of a squeegee. Generally, the technique uses a natural or synthetic 'mesh' fabric stretched tightly across a rectangular 'frame,' much like a stretched canvas. The fabric can be silk, nylon monofilament, multifilament polyester, or even stainless steel. While commercial screen printing often requires high-tech, mechanical apparatuses and calibrated materials, printmakers value it for the \"Do It Yourself\" approach, and the low technical requirements, high quality results. The essential tools required are a squeegee, a mesh fabric, a frame, and a stencil. Unlike many other printmaking processes, a printing press is not required, as screen printing is essentially stencil printing.\nScreen printing may be adapted to printing on a variety of materials, from paper, cloth, and canvas to rubber, glass, and metal. Artists have used the technique to print on bottles, on slabs of granite, directly onto walls, and to reproduce images on textiles which would distort under pressure from printing presses.\nMonotype.\nMonotyping is a type of printmaking made by drawing or painting on a smooth, non-absorbent surface. The surface, or matrix, was historically a copper etching plate, but in contemporary work it can vary from zinc or glass to acrylic glass. The image is then transferred onto a sheet of paper by pressing the two together, usually using a printing-press. Monotypes can also be created by inking an entire surface and then, using brushes or rags, removing ink to create a subtractive image, e.g. creating lights from a field of opaque color. The inks used may be oil based or water based. With oil based inks, the paper may be dry, in which case the image has more contrast, or the paper may be damp, in which case the image has a 10 percent greater range of tones.\nUnlike monoprinting, monotyping produces a unique print, or monotype, because most of the ink is removed during the initial pressing. Although subsequent reprintings are sometimes possible, they differ greatly from the first print and are generally considered inferior. A second print from the original plate is called a \"ghost print\" or \"cognate\". Stencils, watercolor, solvents, brushes, and other tools are often used to embellish a monotype print. Monotypes are often spontaneously executed and with no preliminary sketch.\nMonotypes are the most painterly method among the printmaking techniques, a unique print that is essentially a printed painting. The principal characteristic of this medium is found in its spontaneity and its combination of printmaking, painting, and drawing media.\nMonoprint.\nMonoprinting is a form of printmaking that uses a matrix such as a woodblock, litho stone, or copper plate, but produces impressions that are unique. Multiple unique impressions printed from a single matrix are sometimes known as a variable edition. There are many techniques used in monoprinting, including collagraph, collage, hand-painted additions, and a form of tracing by which thick ink is laid down on a table, paper is placed on the ink, and the back of the paper is drawn on, transferring the ink to the paper. Monoprints can also be made by altering the type, color, and viscosity of the ink used to create different prints. Traditional printmaking techniques, such as lithography, woodcut, and intaglio, can be used to make monoprints.\nMixed-media prints.\nMixed-media prints may use multiple traditional printmaking processes such as etching, woodcut, letterpress, silkscreen, or even monoprinting in the creation of the print. They may also incorporate elements of chine colle, collage, or painted areas, and may be unique, i.e. one-off, non-editioned, prints. Mixed-media prints are often experimental prints and may be printed on unusual, non-traditional surfaces.\nDigital prints.\nArtists using this technique include\nIstvan Horkay, Ralph Goings, Enrique Chagoya\nDigital prints refers to images printed using digital printers such as inkjet printers instead of a traditional printing press. Images can be printed to a variety of substrates including paper, cloth, or plastic canvas.\nDye-based inks.\nDye-based inks are organic (not mineral) dissolved and mixed into a liquid. Although most are synthetic, derived from petroleum, they can be made from vegetable or animal sources. Dyes are well suited for textiles where the liquid dye penetrates and chemically bonds to the fiber. Because of the deep penetration, more layers of material must lose their color before the fading is apparent. Dyes, however, are not suitable for the relatively thin layers of ink laid out on the surface of a print.\nPigment-based inks.\nPigment is a finely ground, particulate substance which, when mixed or ground into a liquid to make ink or paint, does not dissolve, but remains dispersed or suspended in the liquid. Pigments are categorized as either inorganic (mineral) or organic (synthetic). Pigment-based inks have a much longer permanence than dye-based inks.\nGicl\u00e9e.\nGicl\u00e9e (pron.: /\u0292i\u02d0\u02c8kle\u026a/ zhee-KLAY or /d\u0292i\u02d0\u02c8kle\u026a/), is a neologism coined in 1991 by printmaker Jack Duganne for digital prints made on inkjet printers. Originally associated with early dye-based printers it is now more often refers to pigment-based prints. The word is based on the French word gicleur, which means \"nozzle\". Today fine art prints produced on large format ink-jet machines using the CcMmYK color model are generally called \"Gicl\u00e9e\".\nFoil imaging.\nIn art, foil imaging is a printmaking technique made using the Iowa Foil Printer, developed by Virginia A. Myers from the commercial foil stamping process. This uses gold leaf and acrylic foil in the printmaking process.\nDirect-to-garment printing (DTG printing).\nDirect-to-garment printing (DTG) is a process of printing on textiles using specialized aqueous ink jet technology. DTG printers typically have a platen designed to hold the garment in a fixed position, and the printer inks are jetted or sprayed onto the textile by the print head.\nColor.\nPrintmakers apply color to their prints in many different ways. Some coloring techniques include positive surface roll, negative surface roll, and A la poup\u00e9e. Often color in printmaking that involves etching, screen printing, woodcut, or linocut is applied by either using separate plates, blocks or screens or by using a reductionist approach. In multiple plate color techniques, a number of plates, screens or blocks are produced, each providing a different color. Each separate plate, screen, or block will be inked up in a different color and applied in a particular sequence to produce the entire picture. On average about three to four plates are produced, but there are occasions where a printmaker may use up to seven plates. Every application of another plate of color will interact with the color already applied to the paper, and this must be kept in mind when producing the separation of colors. The lightest colors are often applied first, and then darker colors successively until the darkest.\nThe reductionist approach to producing color is to start with a lino or wood block that is either blank or with a simple etching. Upon each printing of color the printmaker will then further cut into the lino or woodblock removing more material and then apply another color and reprint. Each successive removal of lino or wood from the block will expose the already printed color to the viewer of the print. Picasso is often cited as the inventor of reduction printmaking, although there is evidence of this method in use 25 years before Picasso's linocuts.\nThe subtractive color concept is also used in offset or digital print and is present in bitmap or vectorial software in CMYK or other color spaces.\nRegistration.\nIn printmaking processes requiring more than one application of ink or other medium, the problem exists as to how to line up properly areas of an image to receive ink in each application. The most obvious example of this would be a multi-color image in which each color is applied in a separate step. \nThe lining up of the results of each step in a multistep printmaking process is called \"registration.\" Proper registration results in the various components of an image being in their proper place. But, for artistic reasons, improper registration is not necessarily the ruination of an image. Andy Warhol was known to intentionally employ improper registration.\nThis can vary significantly from process to process. This involves the matrices of different colors (generally three or four) being printed successively on the paper in a correct alignment to provide the print in color.\nProtective printmaking equipment.\nProtective clothing is very important for printmakers who engage in etching and lithography (closed toed shoes and long pants). Whereas in the past printmakers put their plates in and out of acid baths with their bare hands, today printmakers use rubber gloves. They also wear industrial respirators for protection from caustic vapors. Most acid baths are built with ventilation hoods above them.\nProtective respirators and masks should have particle filters, particularly for aquatinting. As a part of the aquatinting process, a printmaker is often exposed to rosin powder. Rosin is a serious health hazard, especially to printmakers who, in the past, simply used to hold their breath using an aquatinting booth.\nPrint preservation.\nModern prints on paper protected from the sun and moisture will last for centuries. Works on paper are highly sensitive to environmental factors and handling, making them susceptible to various condition issues. Prints made using newer alkaline and acid-free paper have a life expectancy of over 1,000 years for the best paper and 500 years for average grades. When it comes to older prints, the condition of a print largely depends on the technique used to make the paper. Prints that are several hundred years old may be in better condition than prints that are less than 50 years old. Many older prints will yellow or brown over time owing to acids in the paper and any matting or backing papers. \nFoxing is the appearance of brown spots or blotches in the paper, caused either by mold or chemical reactions. To preserve/restore older prints, washing, deacidification and treatment with stain reducing agents may be in order. Prints in color are especially susceptible to damage from excessive light. Further, if the print is framed, \"archival\" or \"conservation\" grade picture mats are essential since acids within older or inexpensive matting will attack a print even if the print was produced using acid-free paper. Color prints can be susceptible to fading depending on the type of inks used. Lighting of sensitive prints should be limited to 50 lux (5 foot-candles) or less and artificial lights can be equipped with UV-filtering sleeves or tubes.\nPrints onto animal skins (vellum) should also be maintained at a humidity level between 25% and 40%. Prints onto silk are particularly sensitive to any light including camera flashes.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPrintmakers by nationality.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It makes it possible to embed complex objects in simple documents without needing to switch between programming languages or development platforms. The Curl implementation initially consisted of an interpreter only; a compiler was added later.\nCurl combines text markup (as in HyperText Markup Language (HTML)), scripting (as in JavaScript), and heavy-duty computing (as in Java, C#, or C++) within one unified framework. It is used in a range of internal enterprise, business-to-business (B2B), and business-to-consumer (B2C) applications.\nCurl programs may be compiled into Curl applets, that are viewed using the Curl RTE, a runtime environment with a plugin for web browsers. Currently, it is supported on Microsoft Windows. Linux, and macOS was dropped on March 25, 2019 (starting with version 8.0.10). Curl supports https://, which is a web deployed applet which runs on the user's desktop independent of a browser window much as in Microsoft Silverlight 3 and Adobe AIR.\nArchitecture.\nThe Curl language attempts to address a long-standing problem: the different building blocks that make up any modern web document most often require wildly different methods of implementation: different languages, different tools, different frameworks, often completely different teams. The final, and often most difficult, hurdle has been getting all of these blocks to communicate with each other in a consistent manner. Curl attempts to side-step these problems by providing a consistent syntactic and semantic interface at all levels of web content creation: from simple HTML to complex object-oriented programming.\nCurl is a markup language like HTML\u2014that is, plain text is shown as text; at the same time, Curl includes an object-oriented programming language that supports multiple inheritance. Curl applications are not required to observe the separation of information, style, and behavior that HTML, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript have imposed, although that style of programming can be used in Curl if desired.\nWhile the Curl language can be used as an HTML replacement for presenting formatted text, its abilities range all the way to those of a compiled, strongly typed, object-oriented system programming language. Both the authoring (HTML-level) and programming constructs of Curl can be extended in user code. The language is designed so Curl applications can be compiled to native code of the client machine by a just-in-time compiler and run at high speed. Curl applets can also be written so that they can run off-line when disconnected from a network (https://). The http:// is an application written in Curl.\nSyntax.\nA simple Curl applet for a \"Hello, World!\" program might be:\n {text\n color = \"blue\",\n font-size = 16pt,\nThis code will run if the user has at least one of the Curl versions 7.0 or 8.0 installed.\nCurl provides both macros and text-procedures in addition to anonymous procedures and named methods.\nAn alternative using the text-procedure \"paragraph\" would be:\n {paragraph\n paragraph-left-indent=0.5in,\n {text color = \"red\", font-size = 12pt,\n {text color = \"green\", font-size = 12pt,\nRecently this style of layout has been adopted by \"builders\" in the Groovy language for the Java virtual machine (JVM), but is also familiar to users of CSS or Tcl/Tk. Most features for web applications now implemented through combinations of JavaScript libraries + HTML + CSS are already found within the Curl language, including features usually associated with Prototype + script.aculo.us such as accordion panes.\nCurl sets callbacks in the manner also adopted by Groovy:\n {CommandButton width=100pt,\n height = 50pt,\n label = {center {bold Invokes an event handler when clicked}},\n control-color = \"orange\",\n || Attach the following event handler to this CommandButton\n {on Action do\n {popup-message\n title = \"Your Message\",\n \"This is a user message dialog.\"\nCurl comments use the vertical bar in several variations. The simplest is as follows:\n {text A comment can be on a line by itself,\n || A comment on a line by itself\n or it can be at the end || A comment on the same line as code\nAs lightweight markup.\nBecause Curl provides for both user-defined text procedures and style sheets, it can be used readily as domain-specific lightweight markup. A major advantage over plain text HTML markup is that the text encoding can be set to UTF-8, and text entered in a Unicode-enabled text editor with no escaping of characters (like JavaScript, Curl is Unicode friendly). A poetry example is:\n {poem || wraps entire poem\n {stanza || first verse here in any language\n {stanza || another verse here in any language\nwhich can initially be implemented by defining the poem and stanza markup as paragraph text formats. Stanza could be further refined to include a hidden navigation anchor for page navigation using the Curl {destination} which is itself a text procedure.\nThe same markup can be used for different results, as one can style text to be visible in one context and invisible in another. Curl also permits top-level file inclusion so that a source text in markup can be included in different parent files. In education, for example, one could create a source file of test questions, and include it in both a student and a teacher version of the text.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "42540", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42540", "title": "History of the British Virgin Islands", "text": "The history of the British Virgin Islands is usually, for convenience, broken up into five separate periods:\nThese time periods are used for convenience only. There appears to be an uncertain period of time from when the last Arawak left what would later be called the British Virgin Islands until the first Europeans started to settle there in the early 17th century, when records of any settlement are unclear. Each of the above periods is marked by a dramatic change from the preceding time period, providing a way to define the history.\nPre-Columbian settlement.\nThe first recorded settlement of the Territory was by Arawak Indians who came from South America, in around 100 BC. Vernon Pickering places the date later, at around 200 AD, and suggests that the Arawak may have been preceded by the Ciboney Indians. They are thought to have settled in nearby St. Thomas as early as 300 BC. There is some evidence of Amerindian presence on the islands. perhaps in seasonal fishing camps, as far back as 1500 BC. There is little academic support for the idea of a permanent settlement on any of the current British Virgin Islands at that time.\nThe Arawak inhabited the islands until the 15th century, when they were displaced by the more aggressive Caribs, a tribe from the Lesser Antilles islands. The Caribbean Sea is named for these people.\nNone of the later European visitors to the Virgin Islands reported encountering Amerindians in what would later be the British Virgin Islands. Christopher Columbus did have a hostile encounter with the Carib natives of St. Croix.\nComparatively little is known about the early inhabitants of this territory specifically (as opposed to the Arawak generally). The largest excavations of Arawak pottery have been found around Belmont and Smuggler's Cove on the northwest of Tortola. Many other archeological sites have been found with Arawak artifacts, including at Soper's Hole, Apple Bay, Coxheath, Pockwood Pond, Pleasant Valley, Sage Mountain, Russell Hill (modern day Road Town), Pasea, Purcell, Paraquita Bay, Josiah's Bay, Mount Healthy and Cane Garden Bay. Modern archaeological excavations regularly cause local historians to revise what they thought they knew about these early settlers. Discoveries reported in the local newspapers in 2006 have indicated that early Arawak settlement of the islands may have been more significant than had earlier been thought.\n1492: Early European exploration.\nThe first European sighting of the Virgin Islands was by Christopher Columbus in 1493 on his second voyage to the Americas. Columbus gave them the name \"Santa Ursula y las Once Mil V\u00edrgenes\" (Saint Ursula and her 11,000 Virgins), shortened to \"Las V\u00edrgenes\" (The Virgins), after the legend of Saint Ursula. He is also reported to have personally named Virgin Gorda (the Fat Virgin), which he thought to be the largest island in the group.\nThe Spanish claimed the islands by original discovery, but never settled the Territory. In 1508, Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n settled Puerto Rico, and reports in Spanish journals suggested that the settlement used the Virgin Islands for fishing, but nothing else. Their references may have been to the present U.S. Virgin Islands, which are closer.\nIn 1517, Sebastian Cabot and Thomas Spert visited the islands on their return from exploring Brazilian waters. Sir John Hawkins visited the islands three times, firstly in 1542 and then again in 1563 with a cargo of slaves bound for Hispaniola. On his third visit, he was accompanied by a young captain by the name of Francis Drake in the \"Judith\".\nDrake returned in 1585, and is reported to have anchored in North Sound on Virgin Gorda prior to his tactically brilliant attack on Santo Domingo. Drake returned for the final time in 1595 on his last voyage, during which he died. The main channel in the British Virgin Islands was named in his honor.\nIn 1598, George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland, is reported to have used the islands as a staging ground for his later attack on La Fortaleza in Puerto Rico, during conflicts between England and Spain.\nEnglish (and Scottish) King James I granted a patent to James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle, for Tortola, as well as \"Angilla, Semrera (Sombrero island) &amp; Enegada\". Carlisle also received letters of patent for Barbados, St. Kitts and \"all the Caribees\" in 1627 (the \"Carlisle proprietorship\"). He died shortly after, but his son, the 2nd Earl of Carlisle, leased the patents to Lord Willoughby for 21 years in 1647. Neither ever attempted to settle the northern islands.\nFirst Dutch settlements.\nDutch privateer Joost van Dyk organized the first permanent settlements in the Territory in Soper's Hole, on the west end of Tortola. By 1615, van Dyk's settlement was recorded in contemporary Spanish records, which noted its recent expansion. He traded with Spanish colonists in Puerto Rico and farmed cotton and tobacco.\nSome sources suggest that the first settlements in the Virgin Islands were by the Spanish, who mined copper at the copper mine on Virgin Gorda. No archaeological evidence supports any settlement by the Spanish in the islands, nor any mining of copper on Virgin Gorda prior to the 19th century.\nBy 1625, van Dyk was recognized by the Dutch West India Company as the private \"Patron\" of Tortola and had moved his operations to Road Town. During the same year, van Dyk lent some limited (non-military) support to the Dutch admiral Boudewijn Hendricksz, who sacked San Juan, Puerto Rico. In September 1625, in retaliation, the Spanish led a full assault on the island of Tortola, laying waste to its defenses and destroying its embryonic settlements. Joost van Dyk escaped to the island that would later bear his name, and sheltered there from the Spanish. He later moved to the island of St. Thomas until the Spanish gave up and returned to Puerto Rico.\nNotwithstanding Spanish hostility, the Dutch West India Company considered the Virgin Islands to have a significant strategic value, as they were located approximately halfway between the Dutch colonies in South America (now Suriname) and the most important Dutch settlement in North America, New Amsterdam (now New York City). The Dutch built large stone warehouses at Freebottom, near Port Purcell (just east of Road Town), to facilitate exchanges of cargo between North and South America.\nAt this time, the Dutch settlers erected some small earthworks and a three-cannon fort above the warehouse, on the hill. This was the site where the English later built Fort George. The Dutch also constructed a wooden stockade for a lookout post above Road Town. This site was later developed as Fort Charlotte. They stationed troops at the Spanish \"dojon\" near Pockwood Pond, later to be known as Fort Purcell. In the 21st century, it is usually called \"the Dungeon\".\nIn 1631, the Dutch West India Company expressed an interest in the rumors of copper on Virgin Gorda, and a settlement was set up on that island, which came to be known as \"Little Dyk's\" (now known as Little Dix).\nIn 1640, Spain attacked Tortola in an assault led by Captain Lopez. The Spanish attacked again in 1646 and 1647, led by Captain Francisco Vincente Duran. The Spanish anchored a warship in Soper's Hole at West End and landed men ashore. They sent another warship to blockade Road Harbour. After a team of scouts returned a safe report, the Spanish landed more men and attacked Fort Purcell overland by foot. They massacred the Dutch, and next attacked Road Town, killing all inhabitants and destroying the settlement. They did not bother with the smaller settlements further up the coast in Baugher's Bay or on Virgin Gorda.\nDecline of the Dutch West India Company.\nThe Dutch settlements did not return a profit. Evidence suggests that the Dutch settlers spent most of their time more profitably engaged in privateering than in trading. The lack of prosperity of the territory mirrored the lack of commercial success of the Dutch West India Company as a whole.\nThe Company changed its policy. It sought to cede islands such as Tortola and Virgin Gorda to private persons for settlement, and to establish depots to support the slave trade in the Caribbean, as the Company were importing slaves from Africa. The island of Tortola was sold to Willem Hunthum at some point in the 1650s, at which time the Dutch West India Company's interest in the Territory effectively ended. In 1665, the Dutch settlers on Tortola were attacked by a British privateer, John Wentworth; he captured 67 slaves and took them to Bermuda. The record of his prize is the first documentation of slaves being held in the Territory.\nIn 1666, a report to the Company stated that some of the Dutch settlers had been driven out by an influx of British \"brigands and pirates\", although numerous Dutch remained.\n1672: British colonisation.\nEngland took control of the British Virgin Islands in 1672, at the outbreak of the Third Anglo-Dutch War, and have retained influence since. The Dutch averred that in 1672 Willem Hunthum put Tortola under the protection of Colonel Sir William Stapleton, the English Governor-General of the Leeward Islands. Stapleton reported that he had \"captured\" the Territory shortly after the outbreak of war.\nColonel William Burt was dispatched to Tortola and took control of the island no later than 13 July 1672 (when Stapleton reported the conquest to the Council of Trade). Burt did not have sufficient men to occupy the Territory, but before leaving the island, he destroyed the Dutch forts and removed all their cannons to St. Kitts.\nBy the Treaty of Westminster of 1674, the war was ended, and provision was made for mutual restoration of all territorial conquests during the war. The Treaty provided the Dutch with the right to resume possession of the islands, but by then the Dutch were at war with the French, and fear of a French attack prevented their immediate restoration. Although the possessions were not considered valuable, for strategic reasons the British became reluctant to surrender them, and after prolonged discussions, orders were issued to Stapleton in June 1677 to retain possession of Tortola and the surrounding islands.\nIn 1678, the Franco-Dutch War ended, and the Dutch returned their attention to Tortola, although it was not until 1684 that the Dutch ambassador, Arnout van Citters, formally requested the return of Tortola. However, he did not do so on the basis of the Treaty of Westminster, but instead based the claim on the private rights of the widow of Willem Hunthum. He asserted that the island was not a conquest, but had been entrusted to the British. The ambassador provided a letter from Stapleton promising to return the island.\nAt this time (1686), Stapleton had completed his term of office and was \"en route\" back to Britain. The Dutch were told Stapleton would be asked to explain the discrepancy between his assertion of having conquered the island, and the correspondence signed by him indicating a promise to return it, after which a decision would be made. Unfortunately, Stapleton traveled first to France to recover his health, where he died. Cognisant that other Caribbean territories which had been captured from the Dutch during the war had already been restored, in August 1686 the Dutch ambassador was advised by the British that Tortola would be restored, and instructions to that effect were sent to Sir Nathaniel Johnson, the new Governor of the Leeward Islands.\nBut Tortola was never actually returned to the Dutch. Part of the problem was that Johnson's orders were to restore the island to such person or persons who have \"sufficient procuration or authority to receive the same...\" However, most of the former Dutch colonists had now departed, having lost hope of restoration. Certainly there was no official representation of the Dutch monarchy or any other organ of government. In the event, Johnson did nothing.\nIn November 1696, a subsequent claim was made to the island by Sir Peter van Bell, the agent of Sir Joseph Shepheard, a Rotterdam merchant, who claimed to have purchased Tortola on 21 June 1695, for 3,500 guilders. Shepheard was from the Margraviate of Brandenburg, and the prospect of Tortola coming under Brandenburger control did not sit well in Westminster. The Brandenburg claim was dismissed by the British on the grounds that Stapleton had conquered rather than been entrusted with Tortola. The now common delaying tactic of forwarding all correspondence to Governor Codrington for comment was employed. Codrington readily appreciated the risks of a Brandenburg trading outpost on Tortola, as such an outpost already existed on nearby St. Thomas. The Brandenburgers had previously set up an outpost for trading slaves on Peter Island in 1690, which they had abandoned, and they were not considered welcome. At the time they had an outpost on St. Thomas, but they engaged in no agriculture, and only participated in the trading of slaves. Negotiations became more intense, and the British re-asserted the right of conquest and also (wrongly, but apparently honestly) claimed to have first discovered Tortola. During the negotiations, the British also became aware of two older historical claims, the 1628 patent granted to the Earl of Carlisle (which was inconsistent with Hunthum's title being sold to him by the Dutch West India company), and an order of the King in 1694 to prevent foreign settlement in the Virgin Islands. In February 1698, Codrington was told to regard the earlier 1694 orders as final, and the British entertained no further claims to the islands.\nGeographical limits of the territory.\nAlthough the islands which presently form the British Virgin Islands have been under British control since 1672, a number of other islands came under the control of the British Crown (some more than once) during the subsequent period, but no longer form part of the Territory. At the time the British took control of the territory, the following islands were considered part of the Virgin Islands.\nBritain would actually conquer St. Thomas, St. John, and St. Croix in March 1801 through the Napoleonic wars, but they restored them by the Treaty of Amiens in March 1802. They were then re-taken in December 1807, but were restored again by the Treaty of Paris of 1815. Thereafter, they would remain under Danish control until 1917 when they were sold to the U.S.A. for US$25 million, and were later renamed the \"U.S. Virgin Islands\".\nRelationships with the Danes were strained from the outset. The Danes continuously resorted to nearby islands for timber, clearly violating British sovereignty. British ships which foundered in St. Thomas was subject to extortionate levy for salvage. Further, St. Thomas became a base for pirates and privateers which the Danish Governor either could not or would not stop. During the War of the Spanish Succession the Danes supported the French colonies, and allowed the French to sell British ships seized as prizes in Charlotte Amalie. No doubt the British invasions in the early 19th century did not help relations, and in later years smuggling and illegal sales of slaves by St. Thomians would frustrate British authorities.\nLaw and order.\nEven after British control of the Territory became complete, population infiltration was slow. Settlers lived in fear of possible Spanish attack, and there was the constant possibility that diplomatic efforts might fail and the Territory might revert to an overseas power (as happened in St. Croix). Spanish raids in 1685 and ongoing negotiations between the Dutch and the British over the fate of the islands led to them being virtually abandoned; from 1685 to 1690 the population of the Territory was reduced to two - a Mr Jonathan Turner and his wife. In 1690, there was a relative explosion in the population, which had swollen to fourteen. By 1696, it was up to fifty.\nFrom 1678, the British appointed a deputy-governor for the Territory (initially for the Territory and Saba and St. Eustatius, until the latter two islands were returned to the Dutch). The role was somewhat vague, and had no legislative, executory or judicial powers attached to it. The deputy-governor was encouraged to appoint a local governor beneath him, though it was common complaint being unable \"to gett one that's tolerable fitt amongst them to take the command upon them.\" In 1709, Governor Parke observed that \"they live like wild people without law or Government, and have neither Divine nor Lawyer amongst them...\"\nIt was not until 1773 that the Virgin Islands actually had its own legislature.\nEarly attempts to establish a legislature and organs of government in the Territory are considered failures. The uncertainty of tenure and slightly ambivalent official British attitude to the fate of the Territory influenced the early population - for many years only debtors from other islands, pirates and those fleeing the law were prepared to undertake the risk of settling in the Virgin Islands. Most references to the islands from occasional visitors comment on the lack of law and order and the lack of religiosity of the inhabitants.\nThe Territory was granted a Legislative Assembly on 27 January 1774, however, it took a full further decade for a constitutional framework to be settled. Part of the problem was that the islands were so thinly populated, it was almost impossible to constitute the organs of government. In 1778, George Suckling arrived in the Territory to take up his position as Chief Justice of the Territory. In the event, a court was not actually established until the Court Bill was passed in 1783, but even then the vested interests ensured that Suckling could still not take up his position, and the islands had a court but no judge. Suckling finally left the islands without ever taking up his post (or ever being paid) on 2 May 1788, impoverished and embittered, due to the machinations of local interests which were fearful of the recourse of their creditors if a court was to be established. Suckling was forthright in expressing his views on the state of law and order in the Territory - he described the residents of Tortola as \"in a state of lawless ferment. Life, liberty, and property were hourly exposed to the insults and depredations of the riotous and lawless. The authority of His Majesty's Council, as conservators of the peace, was defied and ridiculed... The island presented a shocking state of anarchy; miserable indeed, and disgraceful to government, not to be equaled in any other of His Majesty's dominions, or perhaps in any civilized country in the world.\"\nAlmost 100 years after Governor Parke had expressed his views, one of his successors would speak in similar terms. On his appointment in 1810, Governor Hugh Elliot remarked on \"the state of irritation, nay, I had almost said, of anarchy, in which I have found this Colony ...\" Writer Howard, an agent selling a distressed cargo of slaves from a shipwreck in Tortola in 1803 wrote that \"Tortola is well nigh the most miserable, worst-inhabited spot in all the British possessions... this unhealthy part of the globe appears overstocked with each description of people except honest ones.\"\nQuaker settlement.\nAlthough short in both duration and number, the Quaker settlement in the British Virgin Islands from 1727 to 1768 played an important part in the history of the Territory for two reasons. Firstly, the trenchant opposition of the Quakers to slavery had a contributing effect to the improvements in the treatment of slaves within the Territory (the exceptional case of Arthur William Hodge notwithstanding) compared to other Caribbean islands, and to the large number of free blacks within the islands. Secondly, for such a small community, a large number of famous historical figures came from that small community, including John C. Lettsome, William Thornton, Samuel Nottingham and Richard Humphreys. There are some vague assertions that Arthur Penn, brother of the more famous William Penn, also formed part of the Quaker community of the British Virgin Islands for a time. However, this seems unlikely as the dates of his lifetime do not fit easily within the time frame of the Quaker community in the British Virgin Islands, and as Quaker history is generally very well documented, it is unlikely that an expedition by a member of such a famous family would go unnoticed.\nFortification.\nBetween 1760 and 1800, the British significantly upgraded the defences of the Territory. Usually building upon earlier Dutch fortifications, new structures armed with cannons were erected at Fort Charlotte, Fort George, Fort Burt, Fort Recovery, and a new fort that was built in the centre of Road Town which came to be known as the Road Town Fort. As was common at the time, plantation owners were expected to fortify their own holdings, and Fort Purcell and Fort Hodge were erected on this basis.\nSlave economy.\nIn common with most Caribbean countries, slavery in the British Virgin Islands forms a major part of the history of the Territory. One commentator has gone so far as to say: \"One of the most important aspects of the History of the British Virgin Islands is slavery.\"\nAs Tortola, and to a lesser extent Virgin Gorda, came to be settled by plantation owners, slave labour became economically essential, and there was an exponential growth in the slave population during the 18th century. In 1717 there were 547 black people in the Territory (all of whom were assumed to be slaves); by 1724, there were 1,430; and 1756, there were 6,121. The increase in slaves held in the Territory is, to a large degree, consistent with development of the economy of the British Virgin Islands at the time.\nSlave revolts.\nUprisings in the Territory were common, as they were elsewhere in the Caribbean. The first notable uprising in the British Virgin Islands occurred in 1790, and centred on the estates of Isaac Pickering. It was quickly put down, and the ring leaders were executed. The revolt was sparked by the rumour that freedom had been granted to slaves in England, but that the planters were withholding knowledge of it. The same rumour would also later spark subsequent revolts.\nSubsequent rebellions also occurred in 1823, 1827, and 1830, although in each case they were quickly put down.\nProbably the most significant slave insurrection occurred in 1831 when a plot was uncovered to kill all of the white males in the Territory and to escape to Haiti (which was at the time the only free black republic in the world) by boat with all of the white females. Although the plot does not appear to have been especially well formulated, it caused widespread panic, and military assistance was drafted in from St. Thomas. A number of the plotters (or accused plotters) were executed.\nIt is perhaps unsurprising that the incidence of slave revolts increased sharply after 1822. In 1807, the trade in slaves was abolished. Although the existing slaves were forced to continue their servitude, the Royal Navy patrolled the Atlantic, capturing slave ships, and freeing slave cargoes. Starting in 1808, hundreds of freed Africans were deposited on Tortola by the Navy who, after serving a 14 year \"apprenticeship\", were then absolutely free. Naturally, seeing free Africans in the Territory created enormous resentment and jealousy amongst the existing slave population, who understandably felt this to be enormously unjust.\n1834: Emancipation.\nThe abolition of slavery occurred on 1 August 1834, and to this day it is celebrated by a three-day public holiday on the first Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday in August in the British Virgin Islands. The original emancipation proclamation hangs in the High Court. However, the abolition of slavery was not the single defining event that it is sometimes supposed to have been. Emancipation freed a total of 5,792 slaves in the Territory, but at the time of abolition, there were already a considerable number of free blacks in the Territory, possibly as many as 2,000. Furthermore, the effect of abolition was gradual; the freed slaves were not absolutely manumitted, but instead entered a form of forced apprenticeship which lasted four years for house slaves and six years for field slaves. The terms of the forced apprenticeship required them to provide 45 hours unpaid labour a week to their former masters, and prohibited them from leaving their residence without the masters permission. The effect, deliberately, was to phase out reliance on slave labour rather than end it with a bang. The Council would later legislate to reduce this period to four years for all slaves to quell rising dissent amongst the field slaves.\nJoseph John Gurney, a Quaker, wrote in his \"Familiar Letters to Henry Clay of Kentucky\" that the plantation owners in Tortola were \"decidedly saving money by the substitution of free labor on moderate wages, for the deadweight of slavery\".\nIn practice, the economics of the abolition are difficult to quantify. Undeniably, the original slave owners suffered a huge capital loss. Although they received \u00a372,940 from the British Government in compensation, this was only a fraction of the true economic value of the manumitted slaves. In terms of net cash flow, whilst the slave owners lost the right to \"free\" slave labour, they now no longer had to pay to house, clothe, and provide medical attention for their former slaves, which in some cases almost balanced out. The former slaves now usually worked for the same masters, but instead received small wages, out of which they had to pay for the expenses formerly borne by their masters. However, some former slaves managed to amass savings, which clearly demonstrates that in net terms the slave owners were less well off in income terms as well as capital as a result of abolition.\nDecline of the sugar industry.\nAn often held view is that the economy of the British Virgin Islands deteriorated considerably after the abolition of slavery. Whilst this is, strictly speaking, true, it also disguises the fact that the decline had several different causes. In 1834 the Territory was an agricultural economy with two main crops: sugarcane and cotton. Of the two, sugar was the considerably more lucrative export.\nShortly after the abolition of slavery the Territory was rocked by a series of hurricanes. At the time, there was no accurate method of forecasting hurricanes, and their effect was devastating. A particularly devastating hurricane struck in 1837, which was reported to have completed destroyed 17 of the Territory's sugar works. Further hurricanes hit in 1842 and 1852. Two more struck in 1867 and 1871. The island also suffered severe drought between 1837 and 1847, which made sugar plantations almost impossible to sustain.\nTo compound these miseries, in 1846 the United Kingdom passed the Sugar Duties Act 1846 to equalise duties on sugar grown in the colonies. Removing market distortions had the net effect of making prices fall, a further blow to plantations in the British Virgin Islands.\nIn 1846, the commercial and trading firm of Reid, Irving &amp; Co. collapsed. The firm had 10 sugar estates in the British Virgin Islands and employed 1,150 people. But the actual economic effect of its failure was much wider; the company also acted as a \"de facto\" bank in the Territory, allowing advances to be drawn on the company as credit. Further, the company had represented the only remaining direct line of communication to the United Kingdom; after its collapse, mail had to be sent via St. Thomas and Copenhagen.\nBy 1848, Edward Hay Drummond Hay, the President of the British Virgin Islands, reported that: \"there are now no properties in the Virgin Islands whose holders are not embarrassed for want of capital or credit sufficient to enable them to carry on the simplest method of cultivation effectively.\"\nIn December 1853 there was a disastrous outbreak of cholera in the Territory, which killed nearly 15% of the population. This was followed by an outbreak of smallpox in Tortola and Jost Van Dyke in 1861 which caused a further 33 deaths.\nUp until 1845, the value of sugar exported from the Territory varied, but averaged around \u00a310,000 per annum over the preceding ten years. With the exception of 1847 (an unusually good year), the average for the subsequent 10 years was under \u00a33,000. By 1852, it had fallen below \u00a31,000 and would never recover.\nAlthough this was terrible news for the islands as a whole, as Isaac Dookhan has pointed out, this did mean that the value of land plummeted sharply, and enabled the newly free black community to purchase land where otherwise it might not have been able to do so. It also created the basis for the future peasant agricultural economy of the British Virgin Islands.\nInsurrection.\nSoon after emancipation, the newly freed black population of the British Virgin Islands started to become increasingly disenchanted that freedom had not brought the prosperity that they had hoped for. Economic decline had led to increased tax burdens, which became a source of general discontent, for former slaves and other residents of the Territory alike.\nIn 1848, a major disturbance occurred in the Territory. The causes of the disturbance were several. A revolt of slaves was occurring in St. Croix, which increased the general fervour in the islands, but the free population of Tortola were much more concerned with two other grievances: the appointment of public officials, and the crackdown on smuggling. Although Tortola had sixteen coloured public officials, all except one were \"foreigners\" from outside the Territory. During the period of economic decline, smuggling had been one of the few lucrative sources of employment, and recent laws which imposed stringent financial penalties (with hard labour for non-payment) were unpopular. The anger was directed against the magistrates by the small shop keepers, and they concentrated their attack on the stipendiary magistrate, Isidore Dyett. However, Dyett was popular with the rural population, who respected him for protecting them from unscrupulous planters. The ringleaders of the insurrection had supposed that their attack would lead to a general revolt, but their choice of Dyett as a target robbed them of popular support, and the disturbance eventually fizzled.\nHowever, the insurrection of 1853 was a far more serious affair, and would have much graver and more lasting consequences. Arguably it was the single most defining event in the islands' history. Taxation and economics was also at the root of that disturbance. In March 1853, Robert Hawkins and Joshua Jordan, both Methodist missionaries, petitioned the Assembly to be relieved on taxes. The Assembly rejected the request, and Jordan is said to have replied \"we will raise the people against you.\" Subsequent meetings fostered the general discontent. Then in June 1853 the legislature enacted a head tax on cattle in the Territory. Injudiciously, the tax was to come into effect on 1 August, the anniversary of emancipation. The burden of the tax would fall most heavily on the rural coloured community. There was no violent protest when the Act was passed, and it has been suggested that rioting could have been avoided if the legislature had been more circumspect in enforcing it, although the historical background suggests that insurrection was never far away, and only needed a reason to spark into life.\nOn 1 August 1853, a large body of rural labourers came to Road Town to protest the tax. However, instead of showing a conciliatory approach, the authorities immediately read the Riot Act, and made two arrests. Violence then erupted almost immediately. Several constables and magistrates were badly beaten, the greater part of Road Town itself was burned down, and a large number of the plantation houses were destroyed, cane fields were burned and sugar mills destroyed. Almost all of the white population fled to St. Thomas. President John Chads showed considerable personal courage, but little judgement or tact. On 2 August 1853, he met a gathering of 1,500 to 2,000 protesters, but all he would promise to do was relay their grievances before the legislature (which could not meet, as all the other members had fled). One protester was shot (the only recorded death during the disturbances themselves) which led to the continuation of the rampage. By 3 August 1853, the only white people remaining in the Territory were John Chads himself, the Collector of Customs, a Methodist missionary and the island's doctor.\nThe riots were eventually suppressed with military assistance from St. Thomas, and reinforcements of British troops dispatched by the Governor of the Leeward Islands from Antigua. Twenty of the ringleaders of the riots were sentenced to lengthy terms of imprisonment; three were executed.\n\"Decline and disorder\".\nThe period which followed the riots of 1853 has been referred to by one historian as the period of \"decline and disorder\". Some commentators have suggested that the white population essentially refused to return, and the islands \"went to de bush\". But this is clearly an exaggeration. Whilst many whites did not return to their heavily mortgaged and now ruined estates, some did, and rebuilt. But the rebuilding required as a result of the insurrection, as well as the climate of uncertainty it created, alongside the existing poor economic conditions, created an economic depression which would take nearly a century to lift. It would in fact take a full two years before even the schools in the Territory would be able to open again.\nTensions in the Territory continued to simmer, and local unrest ran high. Exports continued to decline, and large numbers traveled abroad seeking work. In 1887, a plot for an armed rebellion was uncovered. In 1890, a dispute over smuggling led to further violence, and a Long Look resident, Christopher Flemming, emerged as a local hero simply for standing up to authority. In each case widespread damage was averted by bringing in reinforcements for the local authorities from Antigua and, in 1890, from St. Thomas.\nWhilst the violence undoubtedly reflected disenchantment with the economic decline and lack of social services, it would be wrong to construe this period as a form of \"Dark Ages\" for the Territory. During this period there was, for the first time, a significant expansion in the islands' schools. By 1875, the Territory had 10 schools; a remarkable development in light of the complete absence of functional schools after the insurrection of 1853. This period also saw the first coloured British Virgin Islander, Fredrick Augustus Pickering, appointed as President in 1884.\nPickering stepped down in 1887, and in 1889, the title of the office was changed to Commissioner, marking a clear decrease in administrative responsibilities. Offices were also consolidated to save on salaries. The Council itself became less and less functional, and it only narrowly avoided dissolution by appointing two popular local figures, Joseph Romney and Pickering.\nModern developments.\nHowever, in 1901 the Legislative Council \"was\" finally formally dissolved, and the islands were then officially administered through the Governor of the Leeward Islands, who appointed a commissioner and an executive council. The territory was not remotely economically prosperous, and social services had deteriorated to the point of nearly vanishing. Emigration was extremely high, particularly to St. Thomas and to the Dominican Republic. Both concern and assistance from Britain was in very short supply, not least because of the two World Wars which were fought during this period.\nIn 1949 another unlikely hero emerged. Theodolph H. Faulkner was a fisherman from Anegada, who came to Tortola with his pregnant wife. He had a disagreement with the medical officer, and he went straight to the marketplace and for several nights criticised the government with mounting passion. His oratory struck a chord, and a movement started. Led by community leaders such as Isaac Fonseca and Carlton de Castro, on 24 November 1949 a throng of over 1,500 British Virgin Islanders marched on the commissioner's office and presented their grievances. They presented a petition which commenced:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"We are imbued with a desire to decide our local affairs with our own selves. We have outgrown that undesirable stage where one official, or an official clique, makes decisions for us... We are seeking the privilege of deciding how our monies are spent and what shall be our Presidential laws and policies.\"\n1950 \u2013 Self government.\nAs a result of the demonstrations the previous year, the Legislative Council was reinstituted by the British government in 1950 under a new constitution. The reformation of the Legislative Council is often left as a footnote in the territory's history \u2013 a mere part of the process that led to the more fundamental constitutional government in 1967. The 1950 constitution was in fact always envisaged as a temporary measure (it was famously described by McWelling Todman QC as \u201can instrument minimal in its intent and its effect\u201d). But, having been denied any form of democratic control for nearly 50 years, the new council did not sit idly by. In 1951 external capital was brought in to assist farmers from the Colonial Welfare and Development office. In 1953 the Hotel Aid Act was enacted to boost the nascent tourism industry. Up until 1958 the territory had only 12 miles of motorable roads; over the next 12 years the road system was vastly improved, linking West End to the East End of Tortola, and joining Tortola to Beef Island by a new bridge. The Beef Island airport (now renamed after Terrance B. Lettsome) was built shortly thereafter.\nExternal events also played a factor. In 1956 the Leeward Islands Federation was abolished. Defederation enhanced the political status of the British Virgin Islands. Jealous of its newly acquired powers, the council declined to join the new Federation of the West Indies in 1958, a move that would later be crucial in the development of the offshore finance industry.\nIn 1967 a new constitution with a much greater transfer of powers was brought into effect by order-in-council, and introduced true ministerial government to the British Virgin Islands. Elections followed in 1967, and a comparatively young Lavity Stoutt was elected as the first Chief Minister of the territory.\nFinancial services.\nThe fortunes of the Territory dramatically improved in the late twentieth century with the advent of the offshore financial services industry. Former president of the BVI's Financial Services Commission, Michael Riegels, recites the anecdote that the industry commenced on an unknown date in the 1970s when a lawyer from a firm in New York telephoned him with a proposal to incorporate a company in the British Virgin Islands to take advantage of a double taxation relief treaty with the United States. Within the space of a few years, hundreds of such companies had been incorporated.\nThis eventually came to the attention of the United States government, who unilaterally revoked the Treaty in 1981.\nIn 1984 the British Virgin Islands, trying to recapture some of the lost offshore business, enacted a new form of companies legislation, the International Business Companies Act, under which an offshore company which was exempt from local taxes could be formed. The development was only a limited success until 1991, when the United States invaded Panama to oust General Manuel Noriega. At the time Panama was one of the largest providers of offshore financial services in the world, but the business fled subsequent the invasion, and the British Virgin Islands was one of the main beneficiaries. Moreover, in 1988, Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca's founder Ram\u00f3n Fonseca Mora advised his clients to bring their business from Panama to the British Virgin Islands.\nIn 2000, KPMG were commissioned by the British government to produce a report on the offshore financial industry generally, and the report indicated that nearly 41% of the offshore companies in the world were formed in the British Virgin Islands. The British Virgin Islands is now one of the world's leading offshore financial centres, and boasts one of the highest incomes per capita in the Caribbean.\nIn 2017, the total value of assets held in offshore companies in the British Virgin Islands was estimated at $1.5 trillion and two-fifths of company owners were based in Hong Kong and China, according to a report by Capital Economics commissioned by BVI Finance.\nHurricane Irma.\nThe islands were struck by Hurricane Irma on 6 September 2017, causing extensive damage (particularly on Tortola), as well as four deaths in the BVI. The Governor, Gus Jaspert, declared a state of emergency under the Territory's constitution, the first time this had ever happened. A state of emergency was also declared by the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency. The most significant damage was on Tortola. The UK's Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson visited Tortola on 13 September 2017 and said that he was reminded of photos of Hiroshima after it had been hit by the atom bomb.\nBy 8 September, the UK government sent troops with medical supplies and other aid. More troops were expected to arrive a day or two later; the ship\nHMS \"Ocean\", carrying more extensive assistance, was not expected to reach the islands for another two weeks, however.\nThe damage to infrastructure was extensive, and restoration of public electricity to the entire territory took nearly six months. After the hurricane passed, entrepreneur Richard Branson, a resident of Necker Island (British Virgin Islands), called on the UK government to develop a massive disaster recovery plan for British islands that were damaged. That should include \"both through short-term aid and long-term infrastructure spending\", he said. Premier Orlando Smith also called for a comprehensive aid package to rebuild the BVI. On 10 September, British Prime Minister Theresa May pledged \u00a332 million to the Caribbean region generally for a Hurricane relief fund.\nFourteen days after Hurricane Irma, the Territory was struck again by Hurricane Maria, also a Category 5 storm (albeit not as strong as Irma). However the eye of the storm passed to the south of Saint Croix, and the damage was minimal compared to Hurricane Irma.\nIn May 2018 the Immigration Department of the British Virgin Islands announced that the population of the Territory has dropped by approximately 11% since Hurricanes Irma and Maria struck the previous year.\nReferences.\nIt has been commented more than once that there are a paucity of texts which deal with the history of the Territory.

{"id": "42541", "revid": "9399458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42541", "title": "History of Brunei", "text": "The history of Brunei concerns the settlements and societies located on the north coast of the island of Borneo, which has been under the influence of Indianised kingdoms and empires for much of its history. Local scholars assume that the Islamisation of Brunei started in the fifteenth century with the formation of the Bruneian Empire, a thalassocracy that covered the northern part of Borneo and Sulu. At the end of the 17th century, Brunei entered a period of decline brought on by the Brunei Civil War, piracy, and European colonial expansion. Later, there was a brief war with Spain, in which Brunei evacuated its capital for a brief period until the Spanish withdrew. The empire lost much of its territory with the arrival of the Western powers, such as the Spanish in Luzon and Visayas and the British in Labuan, Sarawak, and North Borneo. The decline of the Bruneian Empire accelerated in the nineteenth century when Brunei gave much of its territory to the White Rajahs of Sarawak, resulting in the empire's separation into two parts. Sultan Hashim Jalilul Alam Aqamaddin later appealed to the British to stop further annexation in 1888. In the same year, the British signed a \"Treaty of Protection\" that made Brunei a British protectorate until 1984 when it gained independence and prospered due to the discovery of oil.\nPrehistory.\nThe earliest record of Bruneian people can be traced back to the presence of Austro-Melanesians around 40,000 B.C.E. in the Niah Cave, Sarawak. The remains found there were linked to those found in the Last Glacial Period. During the ice age, Borneo and Palawan were geographically linked.\nAfter the sea level rose about 10,000 years ago, Southeast Asian territories were divided into two regions. The population there began to move around for various reasons. Hoabinhians, or Proto-Melanesians, then moved to Borneo and lived in Niah Cave until around 8,000 B.C.E.\nThe migration from Yangtze started to move toward Taiwan. Then, after Taiwan, the migration wave reached the Philippines via Palawan. After the migration wave reached Palawan, at least three groups began to form distinct communities. One group migrated toward Borneo, another group headed to Sulawesi, and the last moved to Java. The event lasted about a thousand years, between 4,000 and 3,000 B.C.E. The migration at this time signified the end of the bacsonian age. Neolithic usage of pottery and cultivation of rice reached the Austronesians via the Philippines around 2,500 B.C.E. It reached Palawan, then went to Borneo around 2,300 B.C.E. and spread across Insulindia.\nThe Austronesians began to develop a faith or cosmology around megalithism and then started to build social structure and practice agriculture as people settled down and tried to cultivate the land. This Bronze Age cultural complex peaked around 600 B.C.E., centred in Dong Son village, thus called Dongsonian. The introduction of iron and bronze between 500 and 200 B.C.E. marked the end of Neolithic cults and the start of Indian contact in southeast Asia. The Indian trade brought beads of glass or stone to Borneo.\nPre-Islamic Hindu-Buddhist Indianised kingdoms.\nThe history of Brunei before the arrival of Magellan's ships in 1519\u20131522 CE is based on speculation, the interpretation of Chinese sources, and local legends, unless otherwise proven by archaeology. Areas comprising what is now Brunei participated in the Maritime Jade Road, as ascertained by archeological research. The trading network existed for 3,000 years, between 2000 BC and 1000 AD, and was centered on Taiwan and the Philippines.\nCamphor and pepper seem to have been prized objects of trade. Brunei hard camphor had a wholesale value equivalent to its weight in silver. Ming dynasty accounts give detailed information about visits and tribute missions by rulers of \"Po-ni\" (modern Mandarin pronunciation) during the late 14th and early 15th century. Their names and titles suggest either Hindu or Buddhist influence. The texts confirm that the state was tributary to the Hindu Javanese Majapahit Empire, but sought and received Chinese protection in 1408.\nBrunei in the legendary history of Panay island.\nDatu Puti led some dissident datus from Borneo in a rebellion against Datu Makatunaw. The dissidents and their retinue established a new country called Madyaas on Panay island. After the 10 datus established many towns in Panay and southern Luzon, Datu Makatunaw, who was a relative of Datu Puti, seized the properties and riches of the datus. Warriors named Labaw Dunggon and Paybari, after learning of this injustice from their father-in-law Paiburong, sailed to Udtuhan in Borneo where Makatunaw ruled. The warriors sacked the town, killed Makatunaw and his family, retrieved the stolen properties of the 10 datus, enslaved the remaining population of Udtuhan, and sailed back to Panay. Labaw Dunggon and his wife, Uhaytanayon, later settled in a place called Muruburo.\nSyair Awang Semaun epic.\nAccording to the official version of events, mainly the national epic poem \"Syair Awang Semaun\", Brunei was founded by a band of fourteen \"saudara\" (brothers and first cousins) who eventually settled along the Brunei River near the present capital and chose one of their numbers as the first ruler. Some versions of the epic state that they were all the sons of Dewa Amas of Kayangan, a partially supernatural being who descended to earth at Ulu Limbang in an egg. Many Lundayeh / Lun Bawang believe that Awang Semaun is their ancestral land because of Telur Aco.\nSang Aji was married to the ruler's daughter by whom he fathered one son. He traveled to thirteen settlements in the region in search of an auspicious ox. At each of the villages, he fathered thirteen (or twenty-two) other sons by thirteen different aboriginal wives, daughters of the local penghulu.\nThe first ruler chosen by the saudara to rule the newly founded state was Awang Alak Betatar, the son of Dewa Amas and Sang Aji's daughter. He was not necessarily the eldest among them, but he was chosen to rule because of his fitness to do so. The official account states that he journeyed to Johor, embraced Islam, married the daughter of a Sultan \"Bahkei\" of Johor, and received the title of Sultan Muhammad Shah from him.\nBrunei in the 14th century.\nEarly Chinese influence.\nOne of the earliest Chinese records of an independent kingdom in Borneo is the 977 AD letter to the Chinese emperor from the ruler of Boni, which some scholars believe refers to western Borneo. The Bruneians regained their independence from Srivijaya due to the onset of a Javanese-Sumatran war. In 1225, the Chinese official Zhao Rukuo reported that Boni had 100 warships to protect its trade and that there was great wealth in the kingdom. \nAccording to local legends for which no factual confirmation exists, during the early years of the Ming Dynasty, the Emperor of China allegely sent two officers named Wang Kong and Ong Sum Ping to get the \"gemala\" (glowing orb) of the Dragon which supposedly lived on China Balu where the mountain's name itself refers to the great number of Chinese lives lost, being eaten by the Dragon. It is said that Ong Sum Ping later married Princess Ratna Dewi, the daughter of Sultan Muhammad Shah of Brunei. For that he was conferred with the noble title of Pengiran Maharaja Lela and elected Chief of Kinabatangan.\nIslamisation and establishment of the sultanate.\nBy the 15th century, the empire had become a Muslim state, the King of Brunei having declared independence from Majapahit and converting to Islam, which was brought by Muslim Indians and Arab merchants from other parts of Maritime Southeast Asia, who came to trade and spread Islam.{{sfn|Awang Juned|1992}}{{sfn|Saunders|2013|p=23}} During the rule of Bolkiah, the fifth Sultan, the empire controlled the coastal areas of northwest Borneo (present-day Brunei, Sarawak, and Sabah) and reached the Philippines at Sulu.{{sfn|Saunders|2013|p=60}}{{sfn|Herbert|Milner|1989|p=99}}{{sfn|Lea|Milward|2001|p=16}}{{sfn|Hicks|2007|p=34}}{{sfn|Church|2012|p=16}}{{sfn|Eur|2002|p=203}}{{sfn|Abdul Majid|2007|p=2}}{{sfn|Welman|2013|p=8}} In the 16th century, the empire's influence also extended as far as the Kapuas River delta in West Kalimantan.\nOther sultanates in the area had close relations with the royal house of Brunei, in some cases effectively coming under the hegemony of the Brunei ruling family for periods of time. These rulers included the Malay sultans of Pontianak, Samarinda, and Banjarmasin. The Malay Sultanate of Sambas, in present-day West Kalimantan, the Sultanate of Sulu, and the Kingdom of Luzon had formed dynastic relations with the royal house of Brunei. The Sultanate of Sarawak (covering present-day Kuching, known to Portuguese cartographers as Cerava, and one of the five great seaports on the island of Borneo), though under the influence of Brunei, was self-governed under Sultan Tengah before being fully integrated into the Bruneian Empire upon Tengah's death in 1641.\nRelations with Europeans.\nBrunei's relations varied with the different European powers in the region.\nPortuguese.\nThe Portuguese, for the most part, were more interested in economic and trading relations with the regional powers and did little to interfere with Brunei's development. This does not mean that relations were always cordial, such as in 1536 when the Portuguese attacked the Muslims in the Moluccas, and the ambassador to the Brunei court had to leave because of the sultan's hostility. The Portuguese also noted that the sultanate was heavily involved in the region's politics and wars, and that Brunei merchants could be found in Ligor and Siam.\nConflict with the Spanish Empire.\nRelations with Spain were far more hostile. From 1565 on, Spanish and Brunei forces engaged in a number of naval skirmishes, and in 1571, the Spanish, who had been sending expeditions from Mexico, succeeded in capturing Manila from the Brunei aristocracy that had been established there. Brunei raised several large fleets intending to recapture the city, but the campaigns, for various reasons, were never launched.{{efn|1=The Chinese pirate Limahon attacked Manila in December 1574, but Brunei was unable to take advantage of the Spaniards' distraction.}} In 1578, the Spanish took Sulu and in April attacked and captured Brunei itself, after demanding that the sultan cease proselytising in the Philippines and, in turn, allow Christian missionaries to be active in his kingdom. The Spaniards withdrew after suffering heavy losses due to an outbreak of cholera or dysentery. They were so weakened by the illness that they decided to abandon Brunei and return to Manila on 26 June 1578, after just 72 days. The short-term damage to the sultanate was minimal, as Sulu regained its independence soon after. However, Brunei failed to regain a foothold on Luzon, with the island firmly in Spanish hands. The Bruneians in their war against Spain, were supported by Lascars and the Ottoman Caliphate. The Spanish were aware of this and complained to their king, relating how Turks and even Granadans (From the Emirate of Granada) assisted Borneans in their war against Spain. Muslim migration from the Ottoman Caliphate, Egypt, Mecca, and Arabia was so constant that Melchor Davalos complained to the Spanish King of their presence in Borneo and the Philippines.\nTo counteract Ottoman assistance to the Bruneians, Spain levied soldiers from their vassal states in Peru and Mexico, to supplement the Spanish troops sent to the Philippines. However, the Bruneian-Spanish conflict eventually died down.\nThe long-term effects of regional changes could not be avoided. After Sultan Hassan, Brunei entered a period of decline, due to internal battles over royal succession as well as the rising influences of European colonial powers in the region, that, among other things, disrupted traditional trading patterns, destroying the economic base of Brunei and many other Southeast Asian sultanates.\nRelationship with the British and Sarawak.\nDuring Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin II's reign, disturbances occurred in Sarawak. In 1839, the British adventurer James Brooke arrived in Borneo and helped the Sultan put down this rebellion. As a reward, Brooke became governor and later \"White Rajah\" of Sarawak and gradually expanded the territory under his control. Brooke never gained control of Brunei, though he did attempt to. He asked the British to check whether or not it would be acceptable for him to claim Brunei as his own; however, they said although Brunei was poorly governed, it had a definite sense of national identity and therefore could not be absorbed by Brooke.\nIn 1843, an open conflict between Brooke and the Sultan ended in the latter's defeat. The Sultan recognised Sarawak's independence. In 1846, Brunei Town was attacked and captured by the British, and Sultan Saifuddin II was forced to sign a treaty to end the British occupation of Brunei Town. In the same year, Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin II ceded Labuan to the British under the Treaty of Labuan.\nIn 1847, the Sultan signed the Treaty of Friendship and Commerce with the British, officially ceding Labuan and establishing a British foothold in the north of Borneo to counterbalance the Dutch presence. In 1850, he signed a similar treaty with the United States, which, after a series of events{{which|date=January 2025}}, resulted in the first consul of the US, Charles Lee Moses, burning down{{why|date=January 2025}} his consulate.{{clarify|date=January 2025}} Over the years, the Sultans of Brunei ceded further stretches of territory to Sarawak; in 1877, stretches to the east of the capital were leased (later ceded) to the British North Borneo Chartered Company (North Borneo). Eventually, due to these seizures of territory, the British occupied the vast majority of the coast of Brunei. The Sultan only stopped handing over territory when Sarawak asked for Limbang, which the Sultan refused. Against the Sultan's wishes, Sarawak obtained control over the territory.\nBritish protectorate of Brunei.\nPost-independence and beyond.\nBrunei gained its independence from the United Kingdom on 1 January 1984, joining ASEAN in the same year. Economic growth from its extensive petroleum and natural gas fields during the 1990s and 2000s, with its GDP increasing 56% from 1999 to 2008, transformed Brunei into an industrialised country. Brunei has the second-highest Human Development Index among the Southeast Asian nations, after Singapore, and is classified as a \"developed country\". In 2014, the Sultan instituted an Islamic Sharia penal code."}

The earliest evidence of hominid occupation discovered in what is today Bulgaria date from at least 1.4 million years ago. Around 5000 BC, a sophisticated civilization already existed which produced some of the first pottery, jewellery and golden artifacts in the world. After 3500\u00a0BC, the Thracians appeared on the Balkan Peninsula. In the late 6th century\u00a0BC, parts of what is currently Bulgaria, in particular the eastern region of the country, came under the Persian Achaemenid Empire. In the 470s BC, the Thracians formed the powerful Odrysian Kingdom which lasted until 46 BC, when it was finally conquered by the Roman Empire. During the centuries, some Thracian tribes fell under ancient Macedonian and Hellenistic, and also Celtic domination. This mixture of ancient peoples was assimilated by the Slavs, who permanently settled on the peninsula after 500 AD.\nCommon Era.\nIn 632 the Bulgars formed an independent state north of the Black Sea that became known as Great Bulgaria under the leadership of Kubrat. Pressure from the Khazars led to the gradual disintegration of Great Bulgaria in the second half of the 7th century. One of Kubrat's successors, Asparuh, leading some of the Bulgar tribes settled in the area around the Danube delta, and subsequently conquered Scythia Minor and Moesia Inferior from the Byzantine Empire, expanding his new kingdom further into the Balkan peninsula. The crucial Battle of Ongal in 680, the peace treaty with Byzantium in 681, and the establishment of a permanent Bulgarian capital at Pliska south of the Danube mark the beginning of the First Bulgarian Empire. The new state brought together local Byzantine population and migrant population as Early Slavs under Bulgar rule, and a slow process of mutual assimilation began. In the following centuries Bulgaria established itself as a powerful empire, dominating the Balkans through its aggressive military traditions, which led to development of a distinct ethnic identity. Its ethnically and culturally diverse people united under a common religion, language and alphabet which formed and preserved the Bulgarian national consciousness despite foreign invasions and influences.\nIn the 11th century, the First Bulgarian Empire collapsed under multiple Rus' and Byzantine attacks and wars, and was conquered and became part of the Byzantine Empire until 1185. Then, a major uprising led by two brothers, Asen and Peter of the Asen dynasty, restored the Bulgarian state to form the Second Bulgarian Empire. After reaching its apogee in the 1230s, Bulgaria started to decline due to a number of factors, most notably its geographic position which rendered it vulnerable to simultaneous attacks and invasions from many sides. A peasant rebellion, one of the few successful such in history, established the swineherd Ivaylo as a Tsar. His short reign was essential in recovering\u2014at least partially\u2014the integrity of the Bulgarian state. A relatively thriving period followed after 1300, but ended in 1371, when factional divisions caused Bulgaria to split into three small Tsardoms. By 1396, they were subjugated by the Ottoman Empire. The Turks eliminated the Bulgarian system of nobility and ruling clergy, and Bulgaria remained an integral Ottoman Empire territory for the next 482 years.\nPost-decline.\nWith the decline of the Ottoman Empire after 1762 (Slavic-Bulgarian history), signs of revival started to emerge. The Bulgarian nobility had vanished, leaving an egalitarian peasant society with a small but growing urban middle class. By the 19th century, the Bulgarian National Revival became a key component of the struggle for independence, which would culminate in the failed April uprising in 1876, which prompted the Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u201378 and the subsequent Liberation of Bulgaria. The initial Treaty of San Stefano was rejected by the Great Powers, and the following Treaty of Berlin limited Bulgaria's territories to 1/3 of Treaty of San Stefano and dividing it into the east rumelia province and the region of principality of Bulgaria. This left many ethnic Bulgarians out of the borders of the new state, which defined Bulgaria's militaristic approach to regional affairs and its allegiance to Germany in both World Wars.\nAfter World War II, Bulgaria became a Communist state, and the General Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party, Todor Zhivkov, served for a period of 35 years, where there was relatively rapid economic growth. The Communist system collapsed at the eve of the 1990s, and several problems in the 1990s decreased the economic development of Bulgaria's agricultural and other industries. A period of relative stabilization began with the election of Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha as prime minister in 2001. Bulgaria joined NATO in 2004 and the European Union in 2007.\nPrehistory.\nThe earliest human remains found in Bulgaria were excavated in the Kozarnika cave, with an approximate age of 1,6 million BC. This cave probably keeps the earliest evidence of human symbolic behaviour ever found. A fragmented pair of human jaws, which are 44,000 years old, were found in Bacho Kiro cave, but it is disputed whether these early humans were in fact Homo sapiens or Neanderthals.\nThe earliest dwellings in Bulgaria \u2013 the Stara Zagora Neolithic dwellings \u2013 date from 6,000 BC and are amongst the oldest human-made structures yet discovered. By the end of the Neolithic, the Karanovo, Hamangia and Vin\u010da cultures developed on what is today Bulgaria, southern Romania and eastern Serbia. The earliest known town in Europe, Solnitsata, was located in present-day Bulgaria. The Durankulak lake settlement in Bulgaria commenced on a small island, approximately 7000 BC and around 4700/4600 BC the stone architecture was already in general use and became a characteristic phenomenon that was unique in Europe.\nThe Eneolithic Varna culture (5000 BC) represents the first civilization with a sophisticated social hierarchy in Europe. The centrepiece of this culture is the Varna Necropolis, discovered in the early 1970s. It serves as a tool in understanding how the earliest European societies functioned, principally through well-preserved ritual burials, pottery, and golden jewellery. The golden rings, bracelets and ceremonial weapons discovered in one of the graves were created between 4,600 and 4200 BC, which makes them the oldest gold artefacts yet discovered anywhere in the world.\nSome of the earliest evidence of grape cultivation and livestock domestication is associated with the Bronze Age Ezero culture. The Magura Cave drawings date from the same era, although the exact years of their creation cannot be pin-pointed.\nAntiquity.\nThe Thracians.\nThe first people to leave lasting traces and cultural heritage throughout the region were the Thracians. Their origin remains obscure. It is generally proposed that a proto-Thracian people developed from a mixture of indigenous peoples and Indo-Europeans from the time of Proto-Indo-European expansion in the Early Bronze Age when the latter, around 1500 BC, conquered the indigenous peoples. Thracian craftsmen inherited the skills of the indigenous civilisations before them, especially in gold working.\nThe Thracians were generally disorganized, but had an advanced culture despite the lack of their own proper script, and gathered powerful military forces when their divided tribes formed unions under the pressure of external threats. They formed the Odrysian kingdom Although the concept of an urban center was not developed until the Roman period, various larger fortifications which also served as regional market centers were numerous. Yet, in general, despite Greek colonization in such areas as Byzantium, Apollonia and other cities, the Thracians avoided urban life.\nThe first Greek colonies in Thrace were founded in the 8th century BC.\nAchaemenid Persian invasions.\nEver since the Macedonian king Amyntas I surrendered his country to the Persians in about 512-511 BC, Macedonians and Persians were strangers no more. Subjugation of Macedonia was part of Persian military operations initiated by Darius the Great (521\u2013486 BC). In 513 BC - after immense preparations - a huge Achaemenid army invaded the Balkans and tried to defeat the European Scythians roaming to the north of the Danube river. Darius' army subjugated several Thracian peoples, and virtually all other regions that touch the European part of the Black Sea, such as parts of nowadays Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, and Russia, before it returned to Asia Minor. Darius left in Europe one of his commanders named Megabazus whose task was to accomplish conquests in the Balkans. The Persian troops subjugated gold-rich Thrace, the coastal Greek cities, as well as defeating and conquering the powerful Paeonians. Finally, Megabazus sent envoys to Amyntas, demanding acceptation of Persian domination, which the Macedonians accepted. Following the Ionian Revolt, the Persian hold over the Balkans loosened, but was firmly restored in 492 BC through the campaigns of Mardonius. The Balkans, including what is nowadays Bulgaria, provided many soldiers for the multi-ethnic Achaemenid army. Several Thracian treasures dating from the Persian rule in Bulgaria have been found. Most of what is today eastern Bulgaria remained firmly under the Persian sway until 479 BC. The Persian garrison at Doriscus in Thrace held out for many years even after the Persian defeat, and reportedly never surrendered. It remained as the last Persian stronghold in Europe.\nThracian Odrysian kingdom (c. 480 BC - 30 BC).\nThracian tribes remained divided and most of them fell under nominal Persian rule from the late 6th century until the first half of the 5th century, until King Teres united most of them under the Odrysian kingdom around 470 BC, probably after the Persian defeat in Greece which later peaked under the leadership of King Sitalces (431\u2013424 BC) and of Cotys I (383\u2013359 BC). This Thracian kingdom thrived between the early 5th century BC and the early 3rd / late 1st century BC. Located in present-day Bulgaria, southeastern Romania (northern Dobruja), northeastern Greece and European Turkey, it was a tribal amalgam dominated by the Odrysians that was the first large political entity to develop in the eastern Balkans. Before the foundation of Seuthopolis in the late 4th century it had no fixed capital. Similar to the Gauls and other Celtic tribes, most Thracians are thought to have lived simply in small fortified villages, usually on hilltops. At the commencement of the Peloponnesian War, Sitalces entered into alliance with the Athenians, and in 429 BC he invaded Macedon (then ruled by Perdiccas II) with a vast army that included 150,000 warriors from independent Thracian tribes. Cotys I on the other hand, went to war with the Athenians for the possession of the Thracian Chersonese.\nAncient Macedon invasions.\nThereafter the Macedonian Empire incorporated the Odrysian kingdom and Thracians became an inalienable component in the extra-continental expeditions of both Philip II and Alexander III (the Great).\nAncient Celtic invasions.\nIn 298 BC, Celtic tribes reached what is today Bulgaria and clashed with the forces of Macedonian king Cassander on Mount Haemos (Stara Planina). The Macedonians won the battle, but that did not stop the Celtic advancement. Many Thracian communities, weakened by the Macedonian occupation, fell under Celtic dominance.\nIn 279 BC, one of the Celtic armies, led by Comontorius, attacked Thrace and succeeded in conquering it. Comontorius established the kingdom of Tylis in what is now eastern Bulgaria. The modern-day village of Tulovo bears the name of the relatively short-lived kingdom. Cultural interactions between Thracians and Celts are evidenced by several items containing elements of both cultures, such as the chariot of Mezek and almost certainly the Gundestrup cauldron.\nTylis lasted until 212 BC, when the Thracians managed to regain their dominant position in the region and disbanded it. Small bands of Celts survived in Western Bulgaria. One such tribe were the \"serdi\", from which \"Serdica\" - the ancient name of Sofia - originates. Even though the Celts remained in the Balkans for more than a century, their influence on the peninsula was modest. By the end of the 3rd century, a new threat appeared for the people of the Thracian region in the shape of the Roman Empire.\nRoman period.\nIn 188 BC, the Romans invaded Thrace, and warfare continued until 46 AD when Rome finally conquered the region.\nSapaean Thracian kingdom (Roman vassal state) (1st century BC - 46 AD).\nThe Sapaean kingdom was an ancient Thracian state in the southeastern Balkans that existed from the middle of the 1st century BC until 46 AD. Succeeding the Classical and Hellenistic era Odrysian kingdom of Thrace, it was dominated by the Sapaean tribe, who ruled from their capital Bizye in what is now northwestern Turkey. Initially only of limited relevance, its power grew significantly in the ancient Roman world as a client state of the late Roman Republic. After the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, Octavian (later emperor Augustus) installed a new dynasty that proved to be highly loyal and expansive. Conquering and ruling much of Thrace on behalf of the Roman Empire, it lasted until 46 AD, when Emperor Claudius annexed the kingdom and made Thracia into a Roman province.\nRoman rule.\nIn 46 AD, the Romans established the province of Thracia. By the 4th century, the Thracians had a composite indigenous identity, as Christian \"Romans\" who preserved some of their ancient pagan rituals. Thraco-Romans became a dominant group in the region, and eventually yielded several military commanders and emperors such as Galerius and Constantine I the Great. Urban centres became well-developed, especially the territories of Serdika, which today the city of Sofia, due to the abundance of mineral springs. The influx of immigrants from around the empire enriched the local cultural landscape; temples of Osiris and Isis have been discovered near the Black Sea coast. Sometime before 300 AD, Diocletian further divided Thracia into four smaller provinces.\nMigration Period (3rd century - 7th century).\nIn the 4th century, a group of Goths arrived in northern Bulgaria and settled in and around Nicopolis ad Istrum. There the Gothic bishop Ulfilas translated the Bible from Greek to Gothic, creating the Gothic alphabet in the process. This was the first book written in a Germanic language, and for this reason at least one historian refers to Ulfilas as \"the father of Germanic literature\". The first Christian monastery in Europe was founded in 344 by Saint Athanasius near modern-day Chirpan following the Council of Serdica.\nDue to the rural nature of the local population, Roman control of the region remained weak. In the 5th century, Attila's Huns attacked the territories of today's Bulgaria and pillaged many Roman settlements. By the end of the 6th century, Avars organized regular incursions into northern Bulgaria, which were a prelude to the \"en masse\" arrival of the Slavs.\nDuring the 6th century, the traditional Greco-Roman culture was still influential, but Christian philosophy and culture were dominant and began to replace it. From the 7th century, Greek became the predominant language under the Eastern Roman Empire's administration, Church and society, replacing Latin.\nSlavs.\nThe Slavs emerged from their original homeland (most commonly thought to have been in Eastern Europe) in the early 6th century and spread to most of eastern Central Europe, Eastern Europe and the Balkans, thus forming three main branches - the West Slavs, the East Slavs and the South Slavs. The easternmost South Slavs settled on the territory of modern Bulgaria during the 6th century.\nMost of the Thracians were eventually Hellenized or Romanized, with some exceptions surviving in remote areas until the 5th century. A portion of the eastern South Slavs assimilated most of them, before the Bulgar \u00e9lite incorporated these peoples into the First Bulgarian Empire.\nBulgars.\nThe Bulgars were a semi-nomadic people of Turkic descent, originally from Central Asia, who from the 2nd century onwards dwelled in the steppes north of the Caucasus and around the banks of river Volga (then Itil). A branch of them gave rise to the First Bulgarian Empire. The Bulgars were governed by hereditary khans. There were several aristocratic families whose members, bearing military titles, formed a governing class. Bulgars were polytheistic, but chiefly worshiped the supreme deity Tangra.\nOld Great Bulgaria.\nUnified under a single ruler, Kurt, or Kubrat (reigned c. 605\u2013c. 642), the Bulgars constituted a powerful polity known to the Eastern Romans as Great Bulgaria. This country was situated between the lower course of the Danube river to the west, the Black Sea and the Azov Sea to the south, the Kuban river to the east and the Donets river to the north. The capital was Phanagoria, on the Azov.\nIn 635, Kubrat signed a peace treaty with emperor Heraclius of the Byzantine Empire, expanding the Bulgar kingdom further into the Balkans. Later, Kubrat was crowned with the title Patrician by Heraclius. The kingdom never survived Kubrat's death. After several wars with the Khazars, the Bulgars were finally defeated and they migrated to the south, to the north, and mainly to the west into the Balkans, where most of the other Bulgar tribes were living, in a state vassal to the Byzantine Empire since the 5th century.\nOne of the successors of Khan Kubrat, Kotrag led nine Bulgar tribes to the north along the banks of the river Volga in what is today Russia, creating the Kingdom of the Volga Bulgars in the late 7th century. This kingdom later became the trade and cultural centre of the north, because it stood on a very strategic position creating a monopoly over the trade among the Arabs, the Norse and the Avars. The Volga Bulgars were the first to ever defeat the Mongolic horde and protected Europe for decades, but after countless Mongol invasions the Kingdom of the Volga Bulgars was destroyed and most of its citizens slaughtered or sold as slaves in Asia.\nAnother successor of Khan Kubrat, Asparuh (Kotrag's brother) moved west, occupying today's southern Bessarabia. After a successful war with Byzantium in 680, Asparuh's khanate conquered initially Scythia Minor and was recognised as an independent state under the subsequent treaty signed with the Byzantine Empire in 681. That year is usually regarded as the year of the establishment of present-day Bulgaria and Asparuh is regarded as the first Bulgarian ruler.\nAnother Bulgar horde, led by Asparuh's brother Kuber, came to settle in Pannonia and later into the region of Macedonia.\nFirst Bulgarian Empire (681\u20131018).\nUnder the reign of Asparuh Bulgaria expanded southwest after the Battle of Ongal and Danubian Bulgaria was created.\nDuring the Late Roman Empire, several Roman provinces covered the territory that comprises present-day Bulgaria: Scythia (Scythia Minor), Moesia (Upper and Lower), Thrace, Macedonia (First and Second), Dacia (Coastal and Inner, both south of Danube), Dardania, Rhodope and Haemismontus, and had a mixed population of Byzantine Greeks, Thracians and Dacians, most of whom spoke either Greek or variants of Vulgar Latin. Several consecutive waves of Slavic migration throughout the 6th and the early 7th centuries led to a dramatic change of the demographics of the region and its almost complete Slavicisation.\nThe son and heir of Asparuh, Tervel, became ruler in the beginning of 8th century when the Byzantine emperor Justinian II asked Tervel for assistance in recovering his throne, for which Tervel received the region Zagore from the Empire and was paid large quantities of gold. He also received the Byzantine title \"Caesar\". Years later, the emperor decided to betray and attack Bulgaria, but his army was crushed in the battle of Anhialo. After the death of Justinian II, the Bulgarians continued their crusades against the empire and in 716 they reached Constantinople. The threat of both the Bulgarians and the Arab menace in the east, forced the new emperor Theodosius III, to sign a peace treaty with Tervel. The successor, Leo III the Isaurian had to deal with an army of 100,000 Arabs led by Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik and a fleet of 2,500 ships that were laying siege on Constantinople in the year 717. Relying on his treaty with Bulgaria, the emperor asked Khan Tervel to help him deal with the Arab invasion. Tervel accepted and the Arabs were decimated outside the walls of the city. The fleet was heavily damaged with the help of Greek fire. The remaining ships were destroyed by a storm, in an attempt to flee. So the Second Arab Siege of Constantinople ended. After the reign of Tervel, there were frequent changes in the ruling houses, which lead to instability and political crisis.\nDecades later, in 768, Telerig of the house Dulo, ruled Bulgaria. His military campaign against Constantine V in the year 774, proved to be unsuccessful. Thrilled with his success against Telerig, the Byzantine Emperor dispatched a fleet 2,000 ships loaded with horsemen. This expedition proved to be a failure, because of strong northern winds near Mesembria. Telerig was aware of the increased presence of spies in the capital Pliska. To decrease this Byzantine influence, he sent a letter to the emperor in which he asks for refuge in Constantinople and wants to know which Byzantine spies can help him. Knowing their names, he slaughters every agent in the capital. His rule marked the end of the political crisis.\nUnder the reign of Krum (802\u2013814) Bulgaria expanded vastly north-west and south, occupying the lands between the middle Danube and Moldova rivers, all of present-day Romania, Sofia in 809 and Adrianople in 813, and threatening Constantinople itself. Krum implemented law reform intending to reduce poverty and strengthen social ties in his vastly enlarged state.\nDuring the reign of Khan Omurtag (814\u2013831), the northwestern boundaries with the Frankish Empire were firmly settled along the middle Danube. A magnificent palace, pagan temples, ruler's residence, fortress, citadel, water mains and baths were built in the Bulgarian capital Pliska, mainly of stone and brick.\nOmurtag pursued policy of repression against Christians. Menologion of Basil II, glorifies Emperor Basil II showing him as a warrior defending Orthodox Christendom against the attacks of the Bulgarian Empire, whose attacks on Christians are graphically illustrated.\nChristianization.\nUnder Boris I, Bulgaria became officially Christian, and the Ecumenical Patriarch agreed to allow an autonomous Bulgarian Archbishop at Pliska. Missionaries from Constantinople, Cyril and Methodius, devised the Glagolitic alphabet, which was adopted in the Bulgarian Empire around 886. The alphabet and the Old Bulgarian language that evolved from Slavonic gave rise to a rich literary and cultural activity centered around the Preslav and Ohrid Literary Schools, established by order of Boris I in 886.\nIn the early 9th century, a new alphabet \u2014 Cyrillic \u2014 was developed at the Preslav Literary School, adapted from the Glagolitic alphabet invented by Saints Cyril and Methodius. An alternative theory is that the alphabet was devised at the Ohrid Literary School by Saint Climent of Ohrid, a Bulgarian scholar and disciple of Cyril and Methodius.\nBy the late 9th and early 10th centuries, Bulgaria extended to Epirus and Thessaly in the south, Bosnia in the west and controlled all of present-day Romania and eastern Hungary to the north reuniting with old roots. A Serbian state came into existence as a dependency of the Bulgarian Empire. Under Tsar Simeon I of Bulgaria (Simeon the Great), who was educated in Constantinople, Bulgaria became again a serious threat to the Byzantine Empire. His aggressive policy was aimed at displacing Byzantium as major partner of the nomadic polities in the area. By subverting the principles of Byzantine diplomacy and political culture, Simeon turned his own kingdom into a society-structuring factor in the nomadic world.\nSimeon hoped to take Constantinople and become emperor of both Bulgarians and Greeks, and fought a series of wars with the Byzantines through his long reign (893\u2013927). At the end of his rule the front had reached the Peloponnese in the south, making it the most powerful state in contemporary Southeast Europe. Simeon proclaimed himself \"Tsar (Caesar) of the Bulgarians and the Romans\", a title which was recognised by the Pope, but not by the Byzantine Emperor. The capital Preslav was said to rival Constantinople, the new independent Bulgarian Orthodox Church became the first new patriarchate besides the Pentarchy and Bulgarian translations of Christian texts spread all over the Slavic world of the time.\nBogomilism.\nDuring the reign of Emperor PeterI (r.927\u2013969) a heretical movement known as Bogomilism arose in Bulgaria. The heresy was named after its founder the priest Bogomil whose name can be translated as dear (\"mil\") to God (\"Bog\"). The main sources about Bogomilism in Bulgaria come from a letter of the Ecumenical Patriarch Theophylact of Constantinople to Peter I (c.940), a treatise by Cosmas the Priest (c.970) and the anti-Bogomil council of Emperor Boril of Bulgaria (1211). Bogomilism was a neo-Gnostic and dualist sect that believed that God had two sons, Jesus Christ and Satan, that represented the two principles good and evil. God had created light and the invisible world, while Satan rebelled and created darkness, the material world and man.\nDecline.\nAfter Simeon's death, Bulgaria was weakened by external and internal wars with Croatians, Magyars, Pechenegs and Serbs and the spread of the Bogomil heresy. Two consecutive Rus' and Byzantine invasions resulted in the seizure of the capital Preslav by the Byzantine army in 971. Under Samuil, Bulgaria somewhat recovered from these attacks and managed to conquer Serbia and Duklja.\nIn 986, the Byzantine emperor Basil II undertook a campaign to conquer Bulgaria. After a war lasting several decades he inflicted a decisive defeat upon the Bulgarians in 1014 and completed the campaign four years later. In 1018, after the death of the last Bulgarian Tsar - Ivan Vladislav, most of Bulgaria's nobility chose to join the Eastern Roman Empire. However, Bulgaria lost its independence and remained subject to Byzantium for more than a century and a half. With the collapse of the state, the Bulgarian church fell under the domination of Byzantine ecclesiastics who took control of the Ohrid Archbishopric.\nBulgaria under Byzantine rule (1018\u20131185).\nNo evidence remains of major resistance or any uprising of the Bulgarian population or nobility in the first decade after the establishment of Byzantine rule. Given the existence of such irreconcilable opponents to the Byzantines as Krakra, Nikulitsa, Dragash and others, such apparent passivity seems difficult to explain. Some historians\nexplain this as a consequence of the concessions that Basil II granted the Bulgarian nobility to gain their allegiance.\nBasil II guaranteed the indivisibility of Bulgaria in its former geographic borders and did not officially abolish the local rule of the Bulgarian nobility, who became part of Byzantine aristocracy as archons or strategoi. Secondly, special charters (royal decrees) of Basil II recognised the autocephaly of the Bulgarian Archbishopric of Ohrid and set up its boundaries, securing the continuation of the dioceses already existing under Samuil, their property and other privileges.\nAfter the death of Basil II the empire entered into a period of instability. In 1040, Peter Delyan organized a large-scale rebellion, but failed to restore the Bulgarian state and was killed. Shortly after, the Komnenos dynasty came into succession and halted the decline of the empire. During this time the Byzantine state experienced a century of stability and progress.\nIn 1180 the last of the capable Komnenoi, Manuel I Komnenos, died and was replaced by the relatively incompetent Angeloi dynasty, allowing some Bulgarian nobles to organize an uprising. In 1185 Peter and Asen, leading nobles of supposed and contested Bulgarian, Cuman, Vlach or mixed origin, led a revolt against Byzantine rule and Peter declared himself Tsar Peter II. The following year, the Byzantines were forced to recognize Bulgaria's independence. Peter styled himself \"Tsar of the Bulgars, Greeks and Wallachians\".\nSecond Bulgarian Empire (1185\u20131396).\nResurrected Bulgaria occupied the territory between the Black Sea, the Danube and Stara Planina, including a part of eastern Macedonia, Belgrade and the valley of the Morava. It also exercised control over Wallachia Tsar Kaloyan (1197\u20131207) entered a union with the Papacy, thereby securing the recognition of his title of \"Rex\" (King) although he desired to be recognized as \"Emperor\" or \"Tsar\" of Bulgarians and Vlachs. He waged wars on the Byzantine Empire and (after 1204) on the Knights of the Fourth Crusade, conquering large parts of Thrace, the Rhodopes, Bohemia, and Moldavia as well as the whole of Macedonia.\nIn the Battle of Adrianople in 1205, Kaloyan defeated the forces of the Latin Empire and thus limited its power from the very first year of its establishment. The power of the Hungarians and to some extent the Serbs prevented significant expansion to the west and north-west. Under Ivan Asen II (1218\u20131241), Bulgaria once again became a regional power, occupying Belgrade and Albania. In an inscription from Turnovo in 1230 he entitled himself \"In Christ the Lord faithful Tsar and autocrat of the Bulgarians, son of the old Asen\".\nThe Bulgarian Orthodox Patriarchate was restored in 1235 with approval of all eastern Patriarchates, thus putting an end to the union with the Papacy. Ivan Asen II had a reputation as a wise and humane ruler, and opened relations with the Catholic west, especially Venice and Genoa, to reduce the influence of the Byzantines over his country. Tarnovo became a major economic and religious centre\u2014a \"Third Rome\", unlike the already declining Constantinople. As Simeon the Great during the first empire, Ivan Asen II expanded the territory to the coasts of three seas (Adriatic, Aegean and Black), annexed Medea - the last fortress before the walls of Constantinople, unsuccessfully besieged the city in 1235 and restored the destroyed since 1018 Bulgarian Patriarchate.\nThe country's military and economic might declined after the end of the Asen dynasty in 1257, facing internal conflicts, constant Byzantine and Hungarian attacks and Mongol domination. Tsar Teodore Svetoslav (reigned 1300\u20131322) restored Bulgarian prestige from 1300 onwards, but only temporarily. Political instability continued to grow, and Bulgaria gradually began to lose territory. This led to a peasant rebellion led by the swineherd Ivaylo, who eventually managed to defeat the Tsar's forces and ascend the throne.\nOttoman incursions.\nA weakened 14th-century Bulgaria faced a new threat from the south, the Ottoman Turks, who crossed into Europe in 1354. By 1371, factional divisions between the feudal landlords and the spread of Bogomilism had caused the Second Bulgarian Empire to split into three small tsardoms\u2014Vidin, Tarnovo and Karvuna\u2014and several semi-independent principalities that fought among themselves, and also with Byzantines, Hungarians, Serbs, Venetians and Genoese.\nThe Ottomans faced little resistance from these divided and weak Bulgarian states. In 1362 they captured Philippopolis (Plovdiv), and in 1382 they took Sofia. The Ottomans then turned their attentions to the Serbs, whom they routed at Kosovo Polje in 1389. In 1393 the Ottomans occupied Tarnovo after a three-month siege. In 1396 the Tsardom of Vidin was also invaded, bringing the Second Bulgarian Empire and Bulgarian independence to an end.\nBulgaria under Ottoman rule (1396\u20131878).\nIn 1393, the Ottomans captured Tarnovo, the capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire, after a three-month siege. In 1396, the Vidin Tsardom fell after the defeat of a Christian crusade at the Battle of Nicopolis. With this the Ottomans finally subjugated and occupied Bulgaria.\nA Polish-Hungarian crusade commanded by W\u0142adys\u0142aw III of Poland set out to free Bulgaria and the Balkans in 1444, but the Turks emerged victorious at the battle of Varna.\nThe new authorities dismantled Bulgarian institutions and merged the separate Bulgarian Church into the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Constantinople (although a small, autocephalous Bulgarian archbishopric of Ohrid survived until January 1767). Turkish authorities destroyed most of the medieval Bulgarian fortresses to prevent rebellions. Large towns and the areas where Ottoman power predominated remained severely depopulated until the 19th century.\nThe Ottomans did not normally require the Christians to become Muslims. Nevertheless, there were many cases of forced individual or mass Islamization, especially in the Rhodopes. Bulgarians who converted to Islam, the Pomaks, retained Bulgarian language, dress and some customs compatible with Islam..\nThe Ottoman system began declining by the 17th century and at the end of the 18th had all but collapsed. Central government weakened over the decades and this had allowed a number of local Ottoman holders of large estates to establish personal ascendancy over separate regions. During the last two decades of the 18th and first decades of the 19th centuries the Balkan Peninsula dissolved into virtual anarchy.\nBulgarian tradition calls this period the \"kurdjaliistvo\": armed bands of Turks called \"kurdjalii\" plagued the area. In many regions, thousands of peasants fled from the countryside either to local towns or (more commonly) to the hills or forests; some even fled beyond the Danube to Moldova, Wallachia or southern Russia. The decline of Ottoman authorities also allowed a gradual revival of Bulgarian culture, which became a key component in the ideology of national liberation.\nConditions gradually improved in certain areas in the 19th century. Some towns \u2014 such as Gabrovo, Tryavna, Karlovo, Koprivshtitsa, Lovech, Skopie \u2014 prospered. The Bulgarian peasants actually possessed their land, although it officially belonged to the sultan. The 19th century also brought improved communications, transportation and trade. The first factory in the Bulgarian lands opened in Sliven in 1834 and the first railway system started running (between Rousse and Varna) in 1865.\nBulgarian nationalism was emergent in the early 19th century under the influence of western ideas such as liberalism and nationalism, which trickled into the country after the French Revolution, mostly via Greece. The Greek revolt against the Ottomans which began in 1821 also influenced the small Bulgarian educated class. But Greek influence was limited by the general Bulgarian resentment of Greek control of the Bulgarian Church and it was the struggle to revive an independent Bulgarian Church which first roused Bulgarian nationalist sentiment.\nIn 1870, a Bulgarian Exarchate was created by a firman and the first Bulgarian Exarch, Antim I, became the natural leader of the emerging nation. The Constantinople Patriarch reacted by excommunicating the Bulgarian Exarchate, which reinforced their will for independence. A struggle for political liberation from the Ottoman Empire emerged in the face of the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee and the Internal Revolutionary Organisation led by liberal revolutionaries such as Vasil Levski, Hristo Botev and Lyuben Karavelov.\nApril Uprising and Russo-Turkish War (1870s).\nIn April 1876, the Bulgarians revolted in the April Uprising. The revolt was poorly organized and started before the planned date. It was largely confined to the region of Plovdiv, though certain districts in northern Bulgaria, in Macedonia, and in the area of Sliven also took part. The uprising was crushed by the Ottomans, who brought in irregular troops (bashi-bazouks) from outside the area. Countless villages were pillaged and tens of thousands of people were massacred, the majority of them in the insurgent towns of Batak, Perushtitsa, and Bratsigovo, all in the area of Plovdiv.\nThe massacres aroused a broad public reaction among liberal Europeans such as William Ewart Gladstone, who launched a campaign against the \"Bulgarian Horrors\". The campaign was supported by many European intellectuals and public figures. The strongest reaction, however, came from Russia. The enormous public outcry which the April Uprising had caused in Europe led to the Constantinople Conference of the Great Powers in 1876\u201377.\nTurkey's refusal to implement the decisions of the conference gave Russia a long-waited chance to realise her long-term objectives with regard to the Ottoman Empire. Having its reputation at stake, Russia declared war on the Ottomans in April 1877. The Bulgarians also fought alongside the advancing Russians. Russia established a provisional government in Bulgaria. The Russian army and the Bulgarian Opalchentsi decisively defeated the Ottomans at Shipka Pass and Pleven. By January 1878 they had liberated much of the Bulgarian lands. (See Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878).)\nThird Bulgarian State (1878\u20131946).\nThe Treaty of San Stefano was signed on 3 March 1878 and set up an autonomous Bulgarian principality on the territories of the Second Bulgarian Empire, including the regions of Moesia, Thrace and Macedonia, though the state was \"de jure\" only autonomous but \"de facto\" functioned independently. However, trying to preserve the balance of power in Europe and fearing the establishment of a large Russian client state in the Balkans, the other Great Powers were reluctant to agree to the treaty.\nAs a result, the Treaty of Berlin (1878), under the supervision of Otto von Bismarck of Germany and Benjamin Disraeli of Britain, revised the earlier treaty, and scaled back the proposed Bulgarian state. The new territory of Bulgaria was limited between the Danube and the Stara Planina range, with its seat at the old Bulgarian capital of Veliko Turnovo and including Sofia. This revision left large populations of ethnic Bulgarians outside the new country and defined Bulgaria's militaristic approach to foreign affairs and its participation in four wars during the first half of the 20th century.\nAlexander of Battenberg, a German with close ties to the Russian Tsar, was the first prince (knyaz) of modern Bulgaria from 1879. Everyone had assumed Bulgaria would become a Russian ally. To the contrary, it became a bulwark against Russian expansion, and cooperated with the British. Bulgaria was attacked by Serbia in 1885, but defeated the invaders. It thereby gained respect from the great powers and defied Russia. In response Russia secured the abdication of Prince Alexander in 1886.\nStefan Stambolov (1854\u20131895) served 1886-1894 first as regent and then prime minister for the new ruler, Ferdinand I of Bulgaria (prince 1887\u20131908, tsar 1908\u20131918). Stambolov believed that Russia's liberation of Bulgaria from Turkish rule had been an attempt by Czarist Russia to turn Bulgaria into its protectorate. His policy was characterized by the goal of preserving Bulgarian independence at all costs, working with both the Liberal majority and Conservative minority parties. During his leadership Bulgaria was transformed from an Ottoman province into a modern European state. Stambolov launched a new course in Bulgarian foreign policy, independent of the interests of any great power. His main foreign policy objective was the unification of the Bulgarian nation into a nation-state consisting of all the territories of the Bulgarian Exarchate granted by the Sultan in 1870. Stambolov established close connections with the Sultan in order to enliven Bulgarian national spirit in Macedonia and to oppose Russian-backed Greek and Serbian propaganda. As a result of Stambolov's tactics, the Sultan recognised Bulgarians as the predominant people in Macedonia and gave a green light to the creation of a strong church and cultural institutions. Stambolov negotiated loans with western European countries to develop the economic and military strength of Bulgaria. In part, this was motivated by his desire to create a modern army which could secure all of the national territory. His approach toward western Europe was one of diplomatic manoeuvring. He understood the interests of the Austrian Empire in Macedonia and warned his diplomats accordingly. His domestic policy was distinguished by the defeat of terrorist groups sponsored by Russia, the strengthening of the rule of law, and rapid economic and educational growth, leading to progressive social and cultural change, and development of a modern army capable of protecting Bulgaria's independence. Stambolov was aware that Bulgaria had to be politically, militarily, and economically strong to achieve national unification. He mapped out the political course which turned Bulgaria into a strong regional power, respected by the great powers of the day. However, Bulgaria's regional leadership was short-lived. After Stambolov's death the independent course of his policy was abandoned.\nBulgaria emerged from Turkish rule as a poor, underdeveloped agricultural country, with little industry or tapped natural resources. Most of the land was owned by small farmers, with peasants comprising 80% of the population of 3.8 million in 1900. Agrarianism was the dominant political philosophy in the countryside, as the peasantry organized a movement independent of any existing party. In 1899, the Bulgarian Agrarian Union was formed, bringing together rural intellectuals such as teachers with ambitious peasants. It promoted modern farming practices, as well as elementary education.\nThe government promoted modernization, with special emphasis on building a network of elementary and secondary schools. By 1910, there were 4,800 elementary schools, 330 lyceums, 27 post-secondary educational institutions, and 113 vocational schools. From 1878 to 1933, France funded numerous libraries, research institutes, and Catholic schools throughout Bulgaria. In 1888, a university was established. It was renamed the University of Sofia in 1904, where the three faculties of history and philology, physics and mathematics, and law produced civil servants for national and local government offices. It became the center of German and Russian intellectual, philosophical and theological influences.\nThe first decade of the century saw sustained prosperity, with steady urban growth. The capital of Sofia grew by a factor of 600% - from 20,000 population in 1878 to 120,000 in 1912, primarily from peasants who arrived from the villages to become laborers, \ntradesman and office seekers. Macedonians used Bulgaria as a base, beginning in 1894, to agitate for independence from the Ottoman Empire. They launched a poorly planned uprising in 1903 that was brutally suppressed, and led to tens of thousands of additional refugees pouring into Bulgaria.\nThe Balkan Wars.\nIn the years following independence, Bulgaria became increasingly militarized and was often referred to as the \"Prussia of the Balkans\", with regard to its desire to revise the Treaty of Berlin through warfare. The partition of territories in the Balkans by the Great Powers without regard to ethnic composition led to a wave of discontent not only in Bulgaria, but also in its neighbouring countries. In 1911, Nationalist Prime Minister Ivan Geshov formed an alliance with Greece and Serbia to jointly attack the Ottomans and revise the existing agreements around ethnic lines.\nIn February 1912 a secret treaty was signed between Bulgaria and Serbia and in May 1912 a similar agreement was sealed with Greece. Montenegro was also brought into the pact. The treaties provided for the partition of the regions of Macedonia and Thrace between the allies, although the lines of partition were left dangerously vague. After the Ottoman Empire refused to implement reforms in the disputed areas, the First Balkan War broke out in October 1912 at a time when the Ottomans were tied down in a major war with Italy in Libya. The allies easily defeated the Ottomans and seized most of its European territory.\nBulgaria sustained the heaviest casualties of any of the allies while also making the largest territorial claims. The Serbs in particular did not agree and refused to vacate any of the territory they had seized in northern Macedonia (that is, the territory roughly corresponding to the modern Republic of North Macedonia), saying that the Bulgarian army had failed to accomplish its pre-war goals at Adrianople (to capture it without Serbian help) and that the pre-war agreement on the division of Macedonia had to be revised. Some circles in Bulgaria inclined toward going to war with Serbia and Greece on this issue.\nIn June 1913, Serbia and Greece formed a new alliance against Bulgaria. The Serbian Prime Minister Nikola Pasic promised Greece Thrace to Greece [no reference] if it helped Serbia defend the territory it had captured in Macedonia; the Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos agreed [no reference]. Seeing this as a violation of the pre-war agreements, and privately encouraged by Germany and Austria-Hungary, Tsar Ferdinand declared war on Serbia and Greece on June 29.\nThe Serbian and Greek forces were initially beaten back from Bulgaria's western border, but they quickly gained the advantage and forced Bulgaria to retreat. The fighting was very harsh, with many casualties, especially during the key Battle of Bregalnitsa. Soon afterward, the Romania entered the war on the side of Greece and Serbia, attacking Bulgaria from the north. The Ottoman Empire saw this as an opportunity to regain its lost territories and also attacked from the south-east.\nFacing war on three different fronts, Bulgaria sued for peace. It was forced to relinquish most of its territorial acquisitions in Macedonia to Serbia and Greece, Adrianapole to the Ottoman Empire, and the region of Southern Dobruja to Romania. The two Balkan wars greatly destabilized Bulgaria, stopping its hitherto steady economic growth, and leaving 58,000 dead and over 100,000 wounded. The bitterness at the perceived betrayal of its former allies empowered political movements who demanded the restoration of Macedonia to Bulgaria.\nWorld War I.\nIn the aftermath of the Balkan Wars Bulgarian opinion turned against Russia and the Western powers, by whom the Bulgarians felt betrayed. The government of Vasil Radoslavov aligned Bulgaria with the German Empire and Austria-Hungary, even though this meant becoming an ally of the Ottomans, Bulgaria's traditional enemy. But Bulgaria now had no claims against the Ottomans, whereas Serbia, Greece and Romania (allies of Britain and France) held lands perceived in Bulgaria as Bulgarian.\nBulgaria sat out the first year of World War I recuperating from the Balkan Wars. Germany and Austria realized they needed Bulgaria's help in order to defeat Serbia militarily thereby opening supply lines from Germany to Turkey and bolstering the Eastern Front against Russia. Bulgaria insisted on major territorial gains, especially Macedonia, which Austria was reluctant to grant until Berlin insisted. Bulgaria also negotiated with the Allies, who offered somewhat less generous terms. The Tsar decided to go with Germany and Austria and signed an alliance with them in September 1915, along with a special Bulgarian-Turkish arrangement. It envisioned that Bulgaria would dominate the Balkans after the war.\nBulgaria, which had the land force in the Balkans, declared war on Serbia in October 1915. Britain, France and Italy responded by declaring war on Bulgaria. In alliance with Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Ottomans, Bulgaria won military victories against Serbia and Romania, occupying much of Macedonia (taking Skopje in October), advancing into Greek Macedonia, and taking Dobruja from Romania in September 1916. Thus Serbia was temporarily knocked out of the war, and Turkey was temporarily rescued from collapse. By 1917, Bulgaria fielded more than a quarter of its 4.5 million population in a 1,200,000-strong army, and inflicted heavy losses on Serbia (Kaymakchalan), Great Britain (Doiran), France (Monastir), the Russian Empire (Dobrich) and the Kingdom of Romania (Tutrakan).\nHowever, the war soon became unpopular with most Bulgarians, who suffered great economic hardship and also disliked fighting their fellow Orthodox Christians in alliance with the Muslim Ottomans. The Agrarian Party leader Aleksandur Stamboliyski was imprisoned in 1915 for his opposition to the war. The Russian Revolution of February 1917 had a great effect in Bulgaria, spreading anti-war and anti-monarchist sentiment among the troops and in the cities. In June Radoslavov's government resigned. Mutinies broke out in the army, Stamboliyski was released and a republic was proclaimed.\nInterwar years.\nIn September 1918, Tsar Ferdinand abdicated in favour of his son Boris III in order to head off anti-monarchic revolutionary tendencies. Under the Treaty of Neuilly (November 1919) Bulgaria ceded its Aegean coastline to Greece, recognized the existence of Yugoslavia, ceded nearly all of its Macedonian territory to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and had to give Dobruja back to Romania. The country had to reduce its army to no more than 22,000 men and pay reparations exceeding $400 million. Bulgarians generally refer to the results of the treaty as the \"Second National Catastrophe.\"\nElections in March 1920 gave the Agrarians a large majority and Aleksandar Stamboliyski formed Bulgaria's first peasant government. He faced huge social problems, but succeeded in carrying out many reforms, although opposition from the middle and upper classes, the landlords and officers of the army remained powerful. In March 1923, Stamboliyski signed an agreement with the Kingdom of Yugoslavia recognising the new border and agreeing to suppress Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (VMRO), which favoured a war to regain Macedonia from Yugoslavia.\nThis triggered a nationalist reaction and the coup d'\u00e9tat of 9 June 1923 eventually resulted in Stamboliykski's assassination. An extreme right-wing government under Aleksandar Tsankov took power, backed by the army and VMRO, which waged a White terror against Agrarians and Communists. In 1926, after the brief Incident at Petrich, the Tsar persuaded Tsankov to resign, a more moderate government under Andrey Lyapchev took office and an amnesty was proclaimed, although the Communists remained banned. A popular alliance, including the re-organised Agrarians, won the elections of 1931 under the name \"Popular Bloc\".\nIn May 1934 another coup took place, removing the Popular Bloc from power and establishing an authoritarian military r\u00e9gime headed by Kimon Georgiev. A year later, Tsar Boris managed to remove the military r\u00e9gime from power, restoring a form of parliamentary rule (without the re-establishment of the political parties) and under his own strict control. The Tsar's regime proclaimed neutrality, but gradually Bulgaria gravitated into alliance with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy.\nWorld War II.\nUpon the outbreak of World War II, the government of the Kingdom of Bulgaria under Bogdan Filov declared a position of neutrality, being determined to observe it until the end of the war, but hoping for bloodless territorial gains, especially in the lands with a significant Bulgarian population occupied by neighbouring countries after the Second Balkan War and World War I. But it was clear that the central geopolitical position of Bulgaria in the Balkans would inevitably lead to strong external pressure by both sides of World War II. Turkey had a non-aggression pact with Bulgaria.\nBulgaria succeeded in negotiating a recovery of Southern Dobruja, part of Romania since 1913, in the Axis-sponsored Treaty of Craiova on 7 September 1940, which reinforced Bulgarian hopes for solving territorial problems without direct involvement in the war. However, Bulgaria was forced to join the Axis powers in 1941, when German troops that were preparing to invade Greece from Romania reached the Bulgarian borders and demanded permission to pass through Bulgarian territory. Threatened by direct military confrontation, Tsar Boris III had no choice but to join the fascist bloc, which was made official on 1 March 1941. There was little popular opposition, since the Soviet Union was in a non-aggression pact with Germany. However the king refused to hand over the Bulgarian Jews to the Nazis, saving 50,000 lives. Bulgaria sent occupation forces into eastern Serbia, Macedonia and northern Greece (territories it claimed as its own), where atrocities were committed and local Jews were sent to death camps. A resistance movement organised to fight against the Wehrmacht forces in Bulgaria and the Tsardom of Bulgaria authorities. It was mainly communist and pro-Soviet Union.\nBulgaria did not join the German invasion of the Soviet Union that began on 22 June 1941 nor did it declare war on the Soviet Union. However, despite the lack of official declarations of war by both sides, the Bulgarian Navy was involved in a number of skirmishes with the Soviet Black Sea Fleet, which attacked Bulgarian shipping. Besides this, Bulgarian armed forces garrisoned in the Balkans battled various resistance groups. The Bulgarian government was forced by Germany to declare a token war on the United Kingdom and the United States on 13 December 1941, an act which resulted in the bombing of Sofia and other Bulgarian cities by Allied aircraft.\nOn 23 August 1944, Romania left the Axis Powers and declared war on Germany, and allowed Soviet forces to cross its territory to reach Bulgaria. On 5 September 1944 the Soviet Union declared war on Bulgaria and invaded. Within three days, the Soviets occupied the northeastern part of Bulgaria along with the key port cities of Varna and Burgas. Meanwhile, on 5 of September, Bulgaria declared war on Nazi Germany. The Bulgarian Army was ordered to offer no resistance.\nOn 9 September 1944 in a coup the government of Prime Minister Konstantin Muraviev was overthrown and replaced with a government of the Fatherland Front led by Kimon Georgiev. On 16 September 1944 the Soviet Red Army entered Sofia. In October 1944, mobilisation was ordered and Bulgaria sent three armies to fight under the operational command of the Red Army's 3rd Ukrainian Front to repel the Wehrmacht across Central Europe. The Bulgarian Army marked several victories against the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen (at Nish), the 22nd Infantry Division (at Strumica) and other German forces during the operations in Kosovo and at Stratsin. The Soviet army withdraws from Bulgaria after one year.\nPeople's Republic of Bulgaria (1946\u20131991).\nFrom 1946 to 1991 the country was known as the People's Republic of Bulgaria (PRB) and was ruled by the Bulgarian Communist Party (BCP). The BCP transformed itself in 1990, changing its name to \"Bulgarian Socialist Party\".\nCommunist leader Georgi Dimitrov had been in exile, mostly in the Soviet Union, since 1923. Although Stalin executed many other exiles, he was close to Dimitrov and gave him high positions. Dimitrov was arrested in Berlin and showed great courage during the Reichstag fire trial of 1933. Stalin made him head of the Comintern during the period of the Popular Front.\nAfter 1944 he was also close to the Yugoslav Communist leader Josip Broz Tito and believed that Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, as closely related South Slav peoples, should form a federation. This idea was not favoured by Stalin. There have long been suspicions that Dimitrov's sudden death in Moscow in July 1949 was not accidental, although this has never been proven. It coincided with Stalin's expulsion of Tito from the Cominform and was followed by a \"Titoist\" witch hunt in Bulgaria. This culminated in the show trial and execution of Deputy Prime Minister Traicho Kostov (died 16 December 1949). The elderly Prime Minister Vasil Kolarov (born 1877) died in January 1950 and power then passed to a Stalinist, Vulko Chervenkov (1900\u20131980).\nBulgaria's Stalinist phase lasted less than five years. Under his leadership, agriculture was collectivised and a massive industrialisation campaign was launched. Bulgaria adopted a centrally planned economy, similar to those in other COMECON states. In the mid-1940s, when collectivisation began, Bulgaria was a primarily agrarian state, with some 80% of its population located in rural areas. In 1950 diplomatic relations with the U.S. were broken off. But Chervenkov's support base in the Communist Party was too narrow for him to survive long once his patron Stalin was gone. Stalin died in March 1953 and in March 1954 Chervenkov was deposed as Party Secretary with the approval of the new leadership in Moscow and replaced by Todor Zhivkov. Chervenkov stayed on as prime minister until April 1955, when he was dismissed and replaced by Anton Yugov.\nBulgaria experienced a rapid industrial development from the 1950s onwards. From the following decade, the country's economy appeared profoundly transformed. Although many difficulties remained, such as poor housing and inadequate urban infrastructure, modernisation was a reality. The country then turned to high technology, a sector which represented 14% of its GDP between 1985 and 1990. Its factories produce processors, hard disks, floppy disk drives and industrial robots.\nDuring the 1960s, Zhivkov initiated reforms and passed some market-oriented policies on an experimental level. By the mid-1950s standards of living rose significantly, and in 1957 collective farm workers benefited from the first agricultural pension and welfare system in Eastern Europe. Lyudmila Zhivkova, daughter of Todor Zhivkov, promoted Bulgaria's national heritage, culture and arts on a global scale. An assimilation campaign of the late 1980s directed against ethnic Turks resulted in the emigration of some 300,000 Bulgarian Turks to Turkey, which caused a significant drop in agricultural production due to the loss of labor force.\nRepublic of Bulgaria (since 1989).\nBy the time the impact of Mikhail Gorbachev's reform program in the Soviet Union was felt in Bulgaria in the late 1980s, the Communists, like their leader, had grown too feeble to resist the demand for change for long. In November 1989 demonstrations on ecological issues were staged in Sofia and these soon broadened into a general campaign for political reform. The Communists reacted by deposing Zhivkov and replacing him by Petar Mladenov, but this gained them only a short respite.\nIn February 1990 the Communist Party voluntarily gave up its monopoly on power and in June 1990 the first free elections since 1931 were held. The result was a return to power by the Communist Party, now shorn of its hardliner wing and renamed the Bulgarian Socialist Party. In July 1991 a new Constitution was adopted, in which the system of government was fixed as parliamentary republic with a directly elected President and a Prime Minister accountable to the legislature.\nLike the other post-Communist regimes in Eastern Europe, Bulgaria found the transition to capitalism more painful than expected. The anti-Communist Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) took office and between 1992 and 1994 the Berov Government carried through the privatisation of land and industry through the issue of shares in government enterprises to all citizens, but these were accompanied by massive unemployment as uncompetitive industries failed and the backward state of Bulgaria's industry and infrastructure were revealed. The Socialists portrayed themselves as the defender of the poor against the excesses of the free market.\nThe negative reaction against economic reform allowed Zhan Videnov of the BSP to take office in 1995. By 1996 the BSP government was also in difficulties and in the presidential election of that year the UDF's Petar Stoyanov was elected. In 1997 the BSP government collapsed and the UDF came to power. Unemployment, however, remained high and the electorate became increasingly dissatisfied with both parties.\nOn 17 June 2001, Simeon II, the son of Tsar Boris III and himself the former Head of state (as Tsar of Bulgaria from 1943 to 1946), won a narrow victory in elections. The Tsar's party \u2014 National Movement Simeon II (\"NMSII\") \u2014 won 120 of the 240 seats in Parliament. Simeon's popularity declined quickly during his four-year rule as prime minister, and the BSP won the election in 2005, but could not form a single-party government and had to seek a coalition. In the parliamentary elections in July 2009, Boyko Borisov's right-centrist party Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria won nearly 40% of the votes.\nSince 1989 Bulgaria has held multi-party elections and privatized its economy, but economic difficulties and a tide of corruption have led over 800,000 Bulgarians, including many qualified professionals, to emigrate in a \"brain drain\". The reform package introduced in 1997 restored positive economic growth, but led to rising social inequality. The political and economic system after 1989 virtually failed to improve both the living standards and create economic growth. According to a 2009 Pew Global Attitudes Project survey, 76% of Bulgarians said they were dissatisfied with the system of democracy, 63% thought that free markets did not make people better off and only 11% of Bulgarians agreed that ordinary people had benefited from the changes in 1989. Furthermore, the average quality of life and economic performance actually remained lower than in the times of socialism well into the early 2000s (decade).\nBulgaria became a member of NATO on 29 March 2004 and of the European Union on 1 January 2007. In 2010 it was ranked 32nd (between Greece and Lithuania) out of 181 countries in the Globalization Index. \nThe freedom of speech and of the press are respected by the government (as of 2015), but many media outlets are beholden to major advertisers and owners with political agendas. Also see Human rights in Bulgaria. Polls carried out seven years after the country's accession to the EU found only 15% of Bulgarians felt they had personally benefited from the membership.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Furnaces, mines, and surrounding dwellings dating from this time period are found across the country.\nRecent archeological discoveries at Bura in southwest Niger and in adjacent southwest Burkina Faso have documented the existence of the iron-age Bura culture from the 3rd century to the 13th century. The Bura-Asinda system of settlements apparently covered the lower Niger River valley, including the Boura region of Burkina Faso. Further research is needed to understand the role this early culture played in the ancient and medieval history of West Africa.\nLorop\u00e9ni is an ancient stone ruin which was linked to the gold trade between the 14th and 17th centuries. It is a World Heritage Site.\nFrom medieval times until the end of the 19th century, the central region of present-day Burkina Faso was ruled by the Mossi people, descendants of warriors of the Dagomba people of present-day Ghana, who mixed with Mand\u00e9 and other local peoples in the 11th century. During this time the Mossi Kingdoms successfully defended their territory, religious beliefs and social structure against forcible attempts at conquest and conversion by their Muslim neighbors to the northwest.\nFrench Upper Volta.\nThe French arrived and claimed the area in 1896, but Mossi resistance ended only with the capture of their capital Ouagadougou in 1901. In 1919, certain provinces from Ivory Coast were united into French Upper Volta in the French West Africa federation. In 1932, the new colony was split up for economic reasons; it was reconstituted in 1937 as an administrative division called the Upper Coast. After World War II, the Mossi actively pressured the French for separate territorial status and on September 4, 1947, Upper Volta became a French West African territory again in its own right.\nA revision in the organization of French Overseas Territories began with the passage of the Basic Law (Loi Cadre) of July 23, 1956. This act was followed by reorganizational measures approved by the French parliament early in 1957 that ensured a large degree of self-government for individual territories. Upper Volta became an autonomous republic in the French community on December 11, 1958. On July 11, 1960, France agreed to Upper Volta becoming fully independent.\nRepublic of Upper Volta.\nThe Republic of Upper Volta declared independence on 5 August 1960. The first president, Maurice Yam\u00e9ogo, was the leader of the Voltaic Democratic Union (UDV). The 1960 constitution provided for election by universal suffrage of a president and a national assembly for 5-year terms. Soon after coming to power, Yam\u00e9ogo banned all political parties other than the UDV. Yam\u00e9ogo's government was viewed as corrupt and said to perpetuate neo-colonialism by favoring French political and economic interests which had allowed politicians to enrich themselves but not the nation's peasants or small class of urban workers.\nThe government lasted until 1966 when\u2014after much unrest including mass demonstrations and strikes by students, labor unions, and civil servants\u2014the military intervened and deposed Yam\u00e9ogo in the 1966 Upper Voltan coup d'\u00e9tat. The coup leaders suspended the constitution, dissolved the National Assembly, and placed Lieutenant Colonel Sangoul\u00e9 Lamizana at the head of a government of senior army officers. The army remained in power for 4 years; on June 14, 1970, the Voltans ratified a new constitution that established a 4-year transition period toward complete civilian rule. Lamizana remained in power throughout the 1970s as president of military or mixed civil-military governments. He faced a major crisis in the form of the Sahel drought and was sent in 1973 to the UN and the US in order to secure aid. After conflict over the 1970 constitution, a new constitution was written and approved in 1977, and Lamizana was reelected by open elections in 1978.\nLamizana's government faced problems with the country's traditionally powerful trade unions, and on November 25, 1980, Colonel Saye Zerbo overthrew President Lamizana in a bloodless coup. Colonel Zerbo established the Military Committee of Recovery for National Progress as the supreme governmental authority, thus eradicating the 1977 constitution.\nColonel Zerbo also encountered resistance from trade unions and was overthrown two years later on November 7, 1982, by Major Dr. Jean-Baptiste Ou\u00e9draogo and the Council of Popular Salvation (CSP). The CSP continued to ban political parties and organizations, yet promised a transition to civilian rule and a new constitution.\nInfighting developed between the right and left factions of the CSP. The leader of the leftists, Captain Thomas Sankara, was appointed prime minister in January\u00a01983, but subsequently arrested. Efforts to free him, directed by Captain Blaise Compaor\u00e9, resulted in a military coup d'\u00e9tat on 4 August 1983.\nThe coup brought Sankara to power and his government began to implement a series of revolutionary programs which included mass-vaccinations, infrastructure improvements, the expansion of women's rights, encouragement of domestic agricultural consumption and anti-desertification projects.\nBurkina Faso.\nOn 2\u00a0August 1984, on President Sankara's initiative, the country's name was changed from Upper Volta to Burkina Faso (\"land of the upright/honest people\"). The presidential decree was confirmed by the National Assembly on 4 August.\nSankara's government formed the National Council for the Revolution (CNR), with Sankara as its president, and established popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDRs). The Pioneers of the Revolution youth programme was also established.\nSankara launched an ambitious socioeconomic programme for change, one of the largest ever undertaken on the African continent. His foreign policies were centred on anti-imperialism, his government denying all foreign aid, pushing for odious debt reduction, nationalising all land and mineral wealth and averting the power and influence of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank. His domestic policies included a nationwide literacy campaign, land redistribution to peasants, railway and road construction and the outlawing of female genital mutilation, forced marriages and polygamy.\nSankara pushed for agrarian self-sufficiency and promoted public health by vaccinating 2,500,000 children against meningitis, yellow fever, and measles. His national agenda also included planting over 10,000,000 trees to halt the growing desertification of the Sahel. Sankara called on every village to build a medical dispensary and had over 350 communities build schools with their own labour.\nFive-day War with Mali.\nOn Christmas Day 1985, tensions with Mali over the mineral-rich Agacher Strip erupted in a war that lasted five days and killed about 100 people. The conflict ended after mediation by President F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny of Ivory Coast. The conflict is known as the \"Christmas war\" in Burkina Faso.\nRule of Blaise Compaor\u00e9.\nThe CDRs, which were formed as popular mass organizations, deteriorated in some areas into gangs of armed thugs and clashed with several trade unions. Tensions over the repressive tactics of the government and its overall direction mounted steadily. On October 15, 1987, Sankara was assassinated in a coup which brought Captain Blaise Compaor\u00e9 to power.\nCompaor\u00e9, Captain Henri Zongo, and Major Jean-Baptiste Boukary Lengani formed the Popular Front (FP), which pledged to continue and pursue the goals of the revolution and to \"rectify\" Sankara's \"deviations\" from the original aims. The new government, in aims of bourgeois support, tacitly moderated many of Sankara's policies. As part of a much-discussed political \"opening\" process, several political organizations, three of them non-Marxist, were accepted under an umbrella political organization created in June 1989 by the FP.\nSome members of the leftist Organisation pour la D\u00e9mocratie Populaire/Mouvement du Travail (ODP/MT) were against the admission of non-Marxist groups in the front. On September 18, 1989, while Compaor\u00e9 was returning from a two-week trip to Asia, Lengani and Zongo were accused of plotting to overthrow the Popular Front. They were arrested and summarily executed the same night. Compaor\u00e9 reorganized the government, appointed several new ministers, and assumed the portfolio of Minister of Defense and Security. On December 23, 1989, a presidential security detail arrested about 30 civilians and military personnel accused of plotting a coup in collaboration with the Burkinabe external opposition.\nBurkina Faso adopted a new constitution on June 2, 1991.\nIn 2005, Compaor\u00e9 elected to his third term. In November 2010, President Compaor\u00e9 was re\u2013elected for a fourth straight term. He won 80.2% of the vote, while Hama Arba Diallo came a distant second with 8.2%.\nIn February 2011, the death of a schoolboy provoked an uprising in the entire country, lasting through April 2011, which was coupled with a military mutiny and with a strike of the magistrates. See 2011 Burkina Faso uprising.\nOverthrow of Compaor\u00e9.\nIn June 2014 Compaor\u00e9's ruling party, the CDP, called on him to organise a referendum that would allow him to alter the constitution in order to seek re-election in 2015; otherwise he would be forced to step down due to term limits.\nOn 30 October 2014 the National Assembly was scheduled to debate an amendment to the constitution which would have enabled Compaor\u00e9 to stand for re-election as president in 2015. Opponents protested this by storming the parliament building in Ouagadougou, starting fires inside it and looting offices; billowing smoke was reported to be coming from the building by the BBC. Opposition spokesman Pargui Emile Par\u00e9, of the People's Movement for Socialism / Federal Party, described the protests as \"Burkina Faso\u2019s black spring, like the Arab spring\".\nCompaor\u00e9 reacted to the events by shelving the proposed constitutional changes, dissolving the government, declaring a state of emergency and offering to work with the opposition to resolve the crisis. Later in the day, the military, under General Honore Traore, announced that it would install a transitional government \"in consultation with all parties\" and that the National Assembly was dissolved; he foresaw \"a return to the constitutional order\" within a year. He did not make clear what role, if any, he envisioned for Compaor\u00e9 during the transitional period. Compaor\u00e9 said that he was prepared to leave office at the end of the transition.\nOn October 31 Compaor\u00e9 announced he had left the presidency and that there was a \"power vacuum\"; he also called for a \"free and transparent\" election within 90 days. Yacouba Isaac Zida then took over the reins as head of state in an interim capacity.\nOn 17 November 2014, a civilian, Michel Kafando, was chosen to replace Zida as transitional head of state, and he was sworn in on 18 November. Kafando then appointed Zida as Prime Minister of Burkina Faso on 19 November 2014.\nOn 19 July 2015, amidst tensions between the military and Prime Minister Zida, Kafando stripped Zida of the defense portfolio and took over the portfolio himself. He also took over the security portfolio, previously held by Zida's ally Auguste Denise Barry. As part of the same reshuffle, he appointed Moussa N\u00e9bi\u00e9 to replace himself as Minister of Foreign Affairs.\nSeptember 2015 failed coup d'\u00e9tat.\nOn 16 September 2015, two days after a recommendation from the National Reconciliation and Reforms Commission to disband the Regiment of Presidential Security (RSP), members of the RSP detained President Kafando and Prime Minister Zida, and installed the National Council for Democracy in power with Gilbert Diend\u00e9r\u00e9 as its chairman.\nThe military chief of staff (the \"chef d'\u00e9tat-major des arm\u00e9es du Burkina Faso\"), Brigadier General Pingrenoma Zagr\u00e9, called on members of the RSP to lay down their arms, promising in a statement that they would not be harmed if they surrendered peacefully.\nKafando was believed to remain under house arrest until 21 September, when he was reported to have arrived at the residence of the French ambassador. The regular army issued an ultimatum to the RSP to surrender by the morning of 22 September.\nKafando was reinstalled as president at a ceremony on 23 September in the presence of ECOWAS leaders.\nOn 25 September the RSP was disbanded by government decree. On 26 September the assets of Diend\u00e9r\u00e9 and others associated with the coup, as well as the assets of four political parties, including the CDP, were frozen by the state prosecutor. Djibril Bassol\u00e9 and Eddie Kombo\u00efgo, who were barred from standing as presidential candidates, both had their assets frozen. Bassol\u00e9 was arrested on 29 September for allegedly supporting the coup.\n2015 general election.\nOn 13 October 2015 it was announced that general elections would be held on 29 November 2015. The Congress for Democracy and Progress was banned from running a presidential candidate, but was still able to participate in the parliamentary election.\nThe presidential election was won by Roch Marc Christian Kabor\u00e9 of the People's Movement for Progress (MPP), who received 53% of the vote in the first round, negating the need for a second round. The parliamentary election was also won by MPP, which scored 34,71% of votes and won 55 seats in the National Assembly, followed by the Union of Progress and Reform (20,53%, 33 seats) and the Congress for Democracy and Progress (13,20%, 18 seats).\nKabor\u00e9 was sworn in as president on 29 December 2015. On 7 January 2016 he appointed Paul Kaba Thieba as Prime Minister.\n2018 status.\nThe 2018 CIA \"World Factbook\" provides this updated summary. \"Burkina Faso is a poor, landlocked country that depends on adequate rainfall. Irregular patterns of rainfall, poor soil, and the lack of adequate communications and other infrastructure contribute to the economy\u2019s vulnerability to external shocks. About 80% of the population is engaged in subsistence farming and cotton is the main cash crop. The country has few natural resources and a weak industrial base. Cotton and gold are Burkina Faso\u2019s key exports ...The country has seen an upswing in gold exploration, production, and exports.\"\n\"While the end of the political crisis has allowed Burkina Faso\u2019s economy to resume positive growth, the country\u2019s fragile security situation could put these gains at risk. Political insecurity in neighboring Mali, unreliable energy supplies, and poor transportation links pose long-term challenges.\" Civil unrest continued to be problematic, according to the report. \"The country experienced terrorist attacks in its capital in 2016, 2017, and 2018 and continues to mobilize resources to counter terrorist threats.\" (In 2018, several governments were warning their citizens not to travel into the northern part of the country and into several provinces in the East Region.) The CIA report also states that \"Burkina Faso's high population growth, recurring drought, pervasive and perennial food insecurity, and limited natural resources result in poor economic prospects for the majority of its citizens\". The report is optimistic in some aspects, particularly the work being done with assistance by the International Monetary Fund. \"A new three-year IMF program (2018-2020), approved in 2018, will allow the government to reduce the budget deficit and preserve critical spending on social services and priority public investments.\"\nNovember 2020 election.\nIn 2020 general election, President Roch Marc Christian Kabor\u00e9 was re-elected. However, his party Mouvement du people MPP, failed to reach absolute parliamentary majority. It secured 56 seats out of a total of 127. The Congress for Democracy and Progress (CDP), the party of former President Blaise Compaor\u00e9, was distant second with 20 seats.\n2022 military coups.\nOn 24 January 2022, President Roch Kabor\u00e9 was ousted in a military coup. Lieutenant Colonel Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba was the leader of Patriotic Movement for Safeguard and Restoration (MPSR), which included all sections of the army. MPSR announced that it had decided to end President Kabore's post. On 31 January, the ruling military government appointed coup leader Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba as interim president. The African Union (AU) suspended the membership of Burkina Faso.\nOn 30 September 2022 the second military coup took place and Damiba was ousted over his inability to deal with an Islamist insurgency. Captain Ibrahim Traor\u00e9 took over as interim leader. President Damiba resigned and left the country. On 6 October 2022, Captain Ibrahim Traore was officially appointed as president of Burkina Faso.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Before becoming autonomous, it had been part of the French Union as the French Upper Volta. On 5 August 1960, it gained full independence from France. On 4 August 1984, it changed its name to Burkina Faso.\nEtymology.\nThe name Upper Volta indicated that the country contains the upper part of the Volta River.\nHistory.\nUpper Volta obtained independence on 5 August 1960, with Maurice Yam\u00e9ogo of the Voltaic Democratic Union-African Democratic Rally (UDV-RDA) becoming the country's first president. A constitution was ratified the same year, establishing presidential elections by direct universal suffrage and a National Assembly, both with five-year terms. Shortly after coming to power, Yam\u00e9ogo banned all political parties other than the UDV-RDA. He had shown a deep authoritarian streak even before becoming president. Between the time he became prime minister of Upper Volta while it was still a French colony and independence two years later, opposition parties were subjected to increased harassment.\nOn 3 January 1966, Yam\u00e9ogo was overthrown in a coup d'\u00e9tat led by army chief Sangoul\u00e9 Lamizana. Although multiparty democracy was nominally restored four years later, Lamizana dominated the country's politics until he was himself overthrown in 1980.\nAfter a series of short-term presidencies, Thomas Sankara then came to power through yet another military coup d'\u00e9tat on 4 August 1983. After the coup, he formed the National Council for the Revolution (CNR), with himself as president. Under the direction of Sankara, the country changed its name on 4 August 1984, from Upper Volta to Burkina Faso, which means \"Land of Incorruptible People\".\nPolitics.\nFrom 1958 to 1960, the Republic of Upper Volta was led by a high commissioner:\nFrom 1971 to 1987, the Republic of Upper Volta was led by a prime minister:\nSymbols.\nFlag.\nThe colours of the national flag corresponded to the names of the Volta's three main tributaries: the Black Volta, the White Volta and the Red Volta.\nNational Hymn.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThis anthem was replaced in 1984 by a new anthem, the Ditany\u00e8.\nCultural references.\nDuring the 1960s, the Soviet Union was sometimes derisively referred to as \"Upper Volta with rockets\", coined by a journalist Xan Smiley, referencing USSR's disproportion of defence sector over relatively undeveloped civilian economy.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nhttps://-a documentary in French about the first President of Upper Volta, Maurice Yam\u00e9go"}
{"id": "42547", "revid": "42811381", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42547", "title": "History of Ivory Coast", "text": " \nHuman arrival in Ivory Coast (officially called C\u00f4te d'Ivoire) has been dated to the Upper Paleolithic period (15,000 to 10,000 BC), or at the minimum, the Neolithic period based on weapon and tool fragments, specifically polished shale axes and remnants of cooking and fishing. The earliest known inhabitants of left traces scattered throughout the territory. Historians believe these people were all either displaced or absorbed by the ancestors of the present inhabitants. Peoples who arrived before the 16th century include the Ehotil\u00e9 (Aboisso), Kotrowou (Fresco), Z\u00e9hiri (Grand Lahou), Ega, and Di\u00e8s (Divo).\nPrehistory and early history.\nLittle is known about the original inhabitants of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. The first recorded history is in the chronicles of North African Muslims who conducted a caravan trade across the Sahara in salt, slaves, gold, and other items from early Roman times. The southern terminals of the trans-Saharan trade routes were located on the edge of the desert, and from there, supplemental trade extended as far south as the edge of the rainforest. The more important terminals\u2014Djenn\u00e9, Gao, and Timbuctu\u2014grew into major commercial centers around which the great Sudanic empires developed. These empires dominated neighboring states by controlling the trade routes with powerful military forces. \nThe Sudanic empires also became centers of Islamic learning. Islam was introduced into western Sudan by Arab traders from North Africa and spread rapidly after the conversion of many important rulers. By the 11th century, the rulers of the Sudan empires had embraced Islam that spread south into the northern areas of contemporary Ivory Coast.\nGhana was the earliest of the Sudan empires; it flourished in present-day eastern Mauritania from the fourth to the 13th century. At the peak of its power in the 11th century, its realms extended from the Atlantic Ocean to Timbuctu. After the decline of Ghana Empire, the Mali Empire grew into a powerful Muslim state, reaching its peak in the early 14th century. The territory of the Mali Empire in Ivory Coast was limited to the northwest corner around Odienn\u00e9. \nThe Songhai Empire flourished there between the 14th and 16th centuries. Songhai was weakened by internal discord, leading to factional warfare. This discord spurred the migrations of peoples southward toward the forest belt. \nThe dense rainforest in the south created barriers to large-scale political organizations like those in the north. In the south, people lived in villages or village clusters whose contacts with the outside world came through long-distance traders. These villagers subsisted on agriculture and hunting.\nKingdoms and Empires.\nFive important states flourished in Ivory Coast in the pre-European era. The Bono kingdom of Gyaman was established in the 17th century by the Abron, an Akan group that fled the developing Ashanti Empire in Ghana. From their settlement south of Bondoukou, the Abron gradually extended their dominance of the Juula, recent emigrants from the market city of Begho. Bondoukou developed into a major center of commerce and Islam. The kingdom's Quranic scholars attracted students from all parts of West Africa. \nIn the mid-18th century in east-central Ivory Coast, other Akan groups fleeing the Ashanti Empire established a Baoul\u00e9 kingdom at Sakasso and two Agni kingdoms, Ind\u00e9ni\u00e9 and Sanwi. The Baoul\u00e9, like the Ashanti, elaborated a highly centralized political and administrative structure under three successive rulers, but it finally split into smaller chiefdoms. Despite the breakup of their kingdom, the Baoul\u00e9 strongly resisted French subjugation. The descendants of the rulers of the Agni kingdoms tried to retain their separate identity long after Ivory Coast's independence; as late as 1969, the Sanwi of Krinjabo attempted to break away from Ivory Coast and form an independent kingdom.\nIn the early 18th century, the Juula established the Muslim Kong Empire in the north-central region inhabited by the S\u00e9noufo, who fled Islamization under the Mali Empire. The Kong Empire was a prosperous center of agriculture, trade, and crafts but weakened gradually because of ethnic diversity and religious discord. The city of Kong was destroyed in 1895 by Samori Tour\u00e9.\nTrade with Europe and the Americas.\nBecause of its location between Europe and the imagined treasures of the Far East, Africa became a destination for the European explorers of the 15th century. The first Europeans to explore the West African coast were the Portuguese. Other European sea powers followed and established trade with many of the coastal peoples of West Africa. At first, trade included gold, ivory, and pepper but the establishment of American colonies in the 16th century spurred demand for slaves. This led to the kidnapping and enslaving of people from the West African coastal regions for transportation to North and South America (see African slave trade). Local rulers obtained goods and slaves from the inhabitants of the interior to fulfill treaties with the Europeans. By the end of the 15th century, trade with the Europeans had resulted in a strong European influence in Africa, permeating north from the West African coast.\nIvory Coast, like the rest of West Africa, was subject to these influences but the absence of sheltered harbors along its coastline prevented Europeans from establishing permanent trading posts. Thus, seaborne trade was irregular and played only a minor role in the penetration and eventual conquest of Ivory Coast by Europeans. The slave trade, in particular, had little effect on the peoples of Ivory Coast. A profitable trade in ivory existed in the 17th century and gave the area its name. However, the resulting decline in elephant population ended the ivory trade by the beginning of the 18th century.\nThe earliest recorded French voyage to West Africa was in 1483. The French founded their first West African settlement, Saint Louis, in the mid-17th century in what is now Senegal; around this time, the Dutch ceded a settlement at Ile de Gor\u00e9e to the French. The French established a mission in 1687 at Assinie, near the Gold Coast (now Ghana) border, and it became the first European outpost in that area. Although Assini's survival was precarious, the French did not establish themselves in Ivory Coast until the mid-19th century. By that time, the French had settlements around the mouth of the Senegal River and at other points along the coasts of Senegal, Gambia, and Guinea-Bissau. Meanwhile, the British had permanent outposts in the same areas and on the Gulf of Guinea, east of Ivory Coast.\nIn the 18th century, Ivory Coast was invaded by two related Akan groups\u2014the Agni, who occupied the southeast, and the Baoul\u00e9s, who settled in the central section. In 1843\u20131844, the French admiral Bou\u00ebt-Willaumez signed treaties with the kings of the Grand Bassam and Assini regions, placing these territories under a French protectorate. French explorers, missionaries, trading companies, and soldiers gradually extended the area under French control inland from the lagoon region. \nActivity along the coast stimulated European interest in the interior, especially along Senegal and Niger rivers. French exploration of West Africa began in the mid-19th century but moved slowly and was based more on individual initiative than government policy. In the 1840s, the French concluded a series of treaties with local West African rulers, enabling the French to build fortified posts along the Gulf of Guinea to serve as permanent trading centers. The first posts in Ivory Coast were at Assinie and Grand-Bassam, which became the colony's first capital. The treaties gave the French sovereignty for trading privileges in exchange for fees or customs paid annually to the local rulers for the use of their land. This arrangement was not entirely satisfactory to the French because trade was limited and misunderstandings over treaty obligations often arose. Nevertheless, the French government maintained the treaties, hoping to expand trade. France also wanted to maintain a presence in the region to limit the growing influence of the British along the Gulf of Guinea coast.\nThe defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War (1871) and the subsequent annexation of the French province of Alsace-Lorraine by Germany caused the French government to abandon its colonial ambitions and withdraw its military garrisons from its West African trading posts, leaving them in the care of resident merchants. The trading post at Grand-Bassam was left to Arthur Verdier, a shipper from Marseille who was named a resident minister when the Ivory Coast was established in 1878.\nIn 1885, France and Germany brought the European powers with interests in Africa together at the Berlin Conference. The conference helped rationalize what became known as the European scramble for Africa. Prince Otto von Bismarck also wanted a greater role in Africa for Germany, which he thought he could achieve in part by fostering competition between France and Britain. The agreement signed by all conference participants in 1885 stipulated that on the African coastline, only European annexations or spheres of influence that involved effective occupation by Europeans would be recognized. Another agreement in 1890 extended this rule to the interior of Africa and resulted in a rush for territory by France, Britain, Portugal, and Belgium.\nEstablishment of French rule.\nTo support its claims of effective occupation, France again assumed direct control of its West African coastal trading posts and embarked on an accelerated program of exploration in the interior in 1886. In 1887, Lieutenant Louis Gustave Binger began a two-year journey across Ivory Coast's interior. By the end of his journey, Binger had secured four treaties that established French protectorates in Ivory Coast. Also in 1887, Verdier's agent, , negotiated five additional agreements that extended French influence from the headwaters of the Niger River Basin through Ivory Coast.\nBy the end of the 1880s, France had established effective control over the coastal regions of Ivory Coast and Britain recognized French sovereignty in the area in 1889. France named Treich-Lapl\u00e8ne the titular governor of the territory in 1889. In 1893, Ivory Coast was made a French colony; agreements with Liberia in 1892 and with Britain in 1893 determined the eastern and western boundaries of the colony, but the northern boundary was not fixed until 1947 when the French government wanted to attach parts of Upper Volta (present-day Burkina Faso) and French Sudan (present-day Mali) to Ivory Coast for economic and administrative reasons.Throughout the process of partition, the Africans were little concerned with the occasional European who came wandering by. Many local rulers of small, isolated communities did not understand or, more often, were misled by the French about the significance of treaties that compromised their authority. However, other local leaders thought that the French could solve economic problems or become allies in the event of a dispute with belligerent neighbors. In the end, the loss of sovereignty by the local rulers was often the result of their inability to counter French deception and military force, rather than a result of support for French encroachment.\nFrench colonial era.\nC\u00f4te d'Ivoire officially became a French colony on 10 March 1893. Louis Gustave Binger who had explored the Gold Coast frontier, was named the first governor. He negotiated boundary treaties with Liberia and Britain (for the Gold Coast). Throughout the early years of French rule, French military contingents went inland to establish new posts. The French settlements encountered resistance from locals, even in areas with treaties of protection. Samori Tour\u00e9 offered the greatest resistance; he had established the Wassoulou Empire over large parts of present-day Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Ivory Coast starting in 1878. Tour\u00e9s large, well-equipped army could manufacture and repair its own firearms, attracting strong support throughout the region. Binger responded to Tour\u00e9's expansion of regional control with military pressure, resulting in fierce resistance. The French campaigns against the Wassoulou intensified in the mid-1890s until they captured Tour\u00e9 in 1898.\nIn 1900, France imposed a head tax for a public works program in the colony, provoking several revolts. The public works programs and the related exploitation of natural resources required a huge workforce. The French imposed a system of forced labor, requiring each adult male Ivorian to work ten days each year without compensation as an obligation to the state. This system was subject to extreme misuse and was the most hated aspect of French colonial rule by the Africans. Because the population of Ivory Coast was insufficient to meet the labor demands of French-held plantations and forests, the greatest users of labor in French West Africa, the French recruited large numbers of workers from Upper Volta to Ivory Coast. The forced labor was not only disadvantageous to the men forced to work but also to the Ivorian farmers as well. As farming gained importance to the economic growth of Ivory Coast, European and African farmers alike worked diligently to enlarge their businesses. This inherently caused a need for more workers, a need far greater than the number of workers available. During this time, amidst World War II, the French government systematically gave worker preference to the European farmers and made the African farmers find voluntary workers locally or close up shop entirely. These systemic injustices caused great strife between the African working class as they were growing further apart from their European counterparts and had little to no say in the matter as none of them were recognized, French citizens. This labor source was so important to the economic life of Ivory Coast that in 1932 the AOF annexed a large part of Upper Volta to Ivory Coast and administered it as a single colony. Many Ivorians viewed the head tax as a violation of the terms of the protectorate treaties because it seemed that France was now demanding a \"coutume or\" payment from the local kings rather than the reverse. Much of the population, especially in the interior, considered the tax a humiliating symbol of submission.\nFrom 1904 to 1958, Ivory Coast was a constituent unit of the Federation of French West Africa. It was a colony and an overseas territory under the Third Republic. Until the period following World War II, governmental affairs in French West Africa were administered from Paris. France's policy in West Africa was reflected mainly in its philosophy of \"association\", meaning that all Africans in Ivory Coast were officially French subjects without rights to representation in Africa or France. In 1905, the French officially abolished slavery in most of French West Africa.\nIn 1908, Gabriel Angoulvant was appointed governor of Ivory Coast. Angoulvant had little prior experience in Africa but believed that the development of Ivory Coast could proceed only after the forceful conquest, or so-called pacification, of the colony. He sent military expeditions into the hinterland to quell resistance. As a result of these expeditions, local rulers were compelled to obey existing antislavery laws, supply porters and food to the French forces, and ensure the protection of French trade and personnel. In return, the French agreed to leave local customs intact and specifically promised not to intervene in the selection of rulers. However, the French often disregarded their side of the agreement, deporting or interning rulers seen as instigators of revolt. They also regrouped villages and established a uniform administration throughout most of the colony. Finally, they replaced the \"coutume\" system with an allowance based on performance.\nFrench colonial policy incorporated concepts of assimilation and association. Assimilation presupposed the inherent superiority of French culture over all others; the assimilation policy in the colony meant the extension of the French language, institutions, laws, and customs. The policy of association not only affirmed the superiority of the French but also entailed different institutions and systems of laws for the colonizer and the colonized. Under this policy, the Africans in Ivory Coast were allowed to preserve their customs insofar as they were compatible with French interests. An indigenous elite trained in French administrative practice formed an intermediary group between the French and the Africans.\nAssimilation was practiced in Ivory Coast to the extent that a small number of Westernised Ivorians were granted the right to apply for French citizenship after 1930. However, most Ivorians were classified as French subjects with no political rights under the principle of association. Moreover, they were drafted for work in mines, on plantations, as porters, and on public projects as part of their tax responsibility. They were also expected to serve in the military and were subject to the indig\u00e9nat, a separate system of laws for Africans.\nIn World War II, the Vichy regime remained in control until 1943, when members of General Charles De Gaulle's provisional government assumed control of all French West Africa. The Brazzaville conference in 1944, the first Constituent Assembly of the Fourth Republic in 1946, and France's gratitude for African loyalty during World War II led to far-reaching governmental reforms in 1946. French citizenship was granted to all African \"subjects,\" the right to organize politically was recognized, and various forms of forced labor were abolished. A turning point in relations with France was reached with the 1956 Overseas Reform Act or Loi-cadre Defferre, which transferred several powers from Paris to elected territorial governments in French West Africa and also removed remaining voting inequalities.\nUntil 1958, governors appointed in Paris administered the colony of Ivory Coast, using a system of direct, centralized administration that left little room for Ivorian participation in policymaking. The French colonial administration also adopted divide-and-rule policies, applying ideas of assimilation only to the educated elite. The French were interested in ensuring that the small but influential elite was sufficiently satisfied with the status quo to refrain from any anti-French sentiment. Although strongly opposed to the practices of association, educated Ivorians believed that they would achieve equality with their French peers through assimilation rather than through complete independence from France, a change that would eliminate the enormous economic advantages of remaining a French possession. After postwar reforms, the Ivorian leaders realized that assimilation implied the superiority of the French over the Ivorians and that discrimination and inequality would end only with independence.\nIndependence.\nAs early as 1944, Charles de Gaulle proposed to change France's politics and take \"the road of a new era.\" In 1946, the French Empire was converted into the French Union which was superseded by the French Community in 1958. In December 1958, Ivory Coast became an autonomous republic within the French Community as a result of a referendum on 7 August that brought community status to all members of the old Federation of French West Africa (except Guinea, which had voted against the association). On 11 July 1960, France agreed to Ivory Coast becoming fully independent. Ivory Coast became independent on 7 August 1960, and permitted its community members to lapse. It established the commercial city Abidjan as its capital.\nIvory Coast's contemporary political history is closely associated with the career of F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny, president of the republic and leader of the Democratic Party of Ivory Coast (PDCI) until his death on 7 December 1993. He was one of the founders of the Rassemblement D\u00e9mocratique Africain (RDA), the leading pre-independence inter-territorial political party for all of the French West African territories except Mauritania.\nHouphou\u00ebt-Boigny first came to political prominence in 1944 as the founder of the African Agricultural Union, an organization that won improved conditions for African farmers and formed a nucleus for the PDCI. After World War II, he was elected by a narrow margin to the first Constituent Assembly. Representing Ivory Coast in the French National Assembly from 1946 to 1959, he devoted much of his effort to inter-territorial political organization and further amelioration of labor conditions. After his thirteen years in the French National Assembly, including almost three years as a minister in the French Government, he became Ivory Coast's first prime minister in April 1959, and the following year was elected its first president.\nIn May 1959, Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny reinforced his position as a dominant figure in West Africa by leading Ivory Coast, Niger, Upper Volta (Burkina Faso), and Dahomey (Benin) into the Council of the Entente, a regional organization promoting economic development. He maintained that the road to African solidarity was through step-by-step economic and political cooperation, recognizing the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other African states.\nHouphou\u00ebt-Boigny was considerably more conservative than most African leaders of the post-colonial period, maintaining close ties to the West and rejecting the leftist and anti-western stance of many leaders at the time. This contributed to the country's economic and political stability. The first multiparty presidential elections were held in October 1990 and Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny won convincingly. He died on 7 December 1993.\nAfter Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny.\nHouphou\u00ebt-Boigny was succeeded by his deputy Henri Konan B\u00e9di\u00e9, President of the Parliament. Konan B\u00e9di\u00e9 was overthrown on the 24th of December 1999, during the 1999 Ivorian coup d'\u00e9tat by General Robert Gu\u00e9\u00ef, a former army commander who was dismissed by B\u00e9di\u00e9. This was the first \"coup d'\u00e9tat\" in the history of Ivory Coast. An economic downturn followed and the junta promised to return the country to democratic rule in 2000.\nGu\u00e9\u00ef allowed elections to be held the following year. When he lost the election to Laurent Gbagbo, Gu\u00e9 at first refused to accept his defeat. However, street protests forced him to step down, and Gbagbo became president on 26 October 2000.\nFirst Civil War.\nOn 19 September 2002, a rebellion in the north and the west of Ivory Coast flared up and the country was divided into three parts. Mass murders occurred, notably in Abidjan from 25 to 27 March, when government forces killed more than 200 protesters, and on 20 and 21 June in Bouak\u00e9 and Korhogo, where purges led to the execution of more than 100 people. In 2002, France sent troops to Ivory Coast as peacekeepers. A reconciliation process under international auspices started in 2003. In February 2004, the United Nations established the United Nations Operation in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (UNOCI)\nDisarmament was supposed to take place on 15 October 2004, but was a failure. Tensions between Ivory Coast and France increased on 6 November 2004, after Ivorian air strikes killed 9 French peacekeepers and an aid worker. In response, French forces attacked the airport at Yamoussoukro, destroying all airplanes in the Ivorian Air Force. Violent protests erupted in both Abidjan and Yamoussoukro and were marked by violence between Ivorians and French peacekeepers. Thousands of foreigners, especially French nationals, evacuated the two cities. Most of the fighting ended by late 2004, with the country, split between a rebel-held north under the leadership of Guillaume Soro and a government-held south under the leadership of Laurent Gbagbo.\nUnder this system, the quality of life dropped overall, with an increase in debt and civil unrest. To answer these problems, the concept of \"ivoirit\u00e9\" was born, a racist term targeted denying political and economic rights to the Northern immigrants. In March 2007 the two sides signed an agreement to hold fresh elections. However, the elections were delayed until 2010, five years after Gbagbo's term of office expired.\nSecond Civil War.\nAfter northern candidate Alassane Ouattara was declared the victor of the 2010 Ivorian presidential election by the country's Independent Electoral Commission (CEI), the President of the Constitutional Council and an ally of Gbagbo, declared the results to be invalid and that Gbagbo was the winner. Both Gbagbo and Ouattara claimed victory and took the presidential oath of office. The international community, including the United Nations, the African Union, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the European Union, the United States, and former colonial power France affirmed their support for Ouattara and called for Gbagbo to step down. However, negotiations to resolve the dispute failed to achieve any satisfactory outcome. Hundreds of people died in escalating violence between pro-Gbagbo and pro-Ouattara partisans and at least a million people fled, mostly from Abidjan.\nInternational organizations reported numerous instances of human rights violations by both sides, particularly in Du\u00e9kou\u00e9. The United Nations and French forces took military action to protect their forces and civilians. Ouattara's forces arrested Gbagbo at his residence on 11 April 2011.\nAfter the 2011 Civil War.\nAlassane Ouattara has ruled Ivory Coast since 2010, when he unseated his predecessor Laurent Gbagbo. Ouattara was re-elected in 2015 presidential election. In November 2020, he won a third term in the 2020 presidential election. His opponents boycotted the election, arguing that a third term was illegal. Ivory Coast's Constitutional Council formally ratified Ouattara's re-election to a third term in November 2020.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Null Island, defined as the intersection of the Equator and Prime Meridian (zero degrees latitude and longitude), is in the gulf.\nAmong the many rivers that drain into the Gulf of Guinea are the Niger and the Volta. The coastline on the gulf includes the Bight of Benin and the Bight of Bonny.\nName.\n\"Guinea\" is thought to have originated from a local name for an area in the region, although the specifics are disputed. Bovill (1995) gives a thorough description:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The name Guinea is usually said to have been a corrupt form of the name Ghana, picked up by the Portuguese in the Maghrib. The present writer finds this unacceptable. The name Guinea has been in use both in the Maghrib and in Europe long before Prince Henry's time. For example, on a map dated about 1320 by the Genoese cartographer Giovanni di Carignano, who got his information about Africa from a fellow-countryman in Sijilmassa [ancient trading city in North Africa], we find Gunuia, and in the Catalan atlas of 1375 as Ginyia. A passage in Leo [Africanus] (vol. III, 822) points to Guinea having been a corrupt form of Jenne [2,000-year-old city in central Mali on Niger river], less famous than Ghana but nevertheless for many centuries famed in the Maghrib as a great market and a seat of learning. The relevant passage reads: \"The Kingdom of Ghinea . . . called by the merchants of our nation Gheneoa, by the natural inhabitants thereof Genni and by the Portugals and other people of Europe Ghinea.\" But it seems more probable that Guinea derives from\" aguinaou\", the Berber for Negro. Marrakech [city in southeastern Morocco] has a gate, built in the twelfth century, called the Bab Aguinaou, the Gate of the Negro (Delafosse, Haut-S\u00e9n\u00e9gal-Niger, II, 277\u2013278). The modern application of the name Guinea to the coast dates only from 1481. In that year the Portuguese built a fort, S\u00e3o Jorge da Mina (modern-day Elmina), on the Gold Coast region, and their king, John II, was permitted by the Pope [Sixtus II or Innocent VIII] to style himself Lord of Guinea, a title that survived until the recent extinction of the monarchy.\nThe name \"Guinea\" was also previously applied to the south coast of West Africa (north of the Gulf of Guinea), which became known as \"Upper Guinea\", and to the west coast of Southern Africa (to the east), which became known as \"Lower Guinea\".\nToday, the word \"Guinea\" is found in the names of three countries in Africa (Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Equatorial Guinea), and in one country in Melanesia (Papua New Guinea).\nGeography.\nThe main river dispensing its waters in the gulf is the Niger River.\nDifferent definitions of the geographic limits of the Gulf of Guinea are given; the International Hydrographic Organization defines the southwest extent of the Gulf of Guinea as \"B line from Cap Lopez (), in Gabon, northwestward to Ihl\u00e9u Gago Coutinho (Ilh\u00e9u das R\u00f4las) (); and thence a line from Ihl\u00e9u Gago Coutinho northwestward to Cape Palmas (), in Liberia.\nIslands in the Gulf of Guinea.\nThe Gulf of Guinea contains a number of islands, the largest of which are in a southwest-northeast chain, forming part of the Cameroon line of volcanoes.\nAnnob\u00f3n, also known as Pagalu or Pigalua, is an island that is part of Equatorial Guinea.\nBobowasi Island is an island off the west coast of Africa in the Gulf of Guinea that is part of the Western Region of Ghana.\nBioko is an island off the Ambazonian region of Cameroon in the Gulf of Guinea under the sovereignty of Equatorial Guinea.\nCorisco is an island belonging to Equatorial Guinea, as are the two small islands of Elobey Grande and Elobey Chico.\nS\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe (officially the Democratic Republic of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe) is a Portuguese-speaking island nation in the Gulf of Guinea that became independent from Portugal in 1975. It is located off the western equatorial coast of Africa and consists of two islands, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe. They are located about apart and about , respectively, off the northwestern coast of Gabon. Both islands are part of an extinct volcanic mountain range. S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, the sizeable southern island, is situated just north of the Equator.\nMaritime security.\nMaritime security in the Gulf of Guinea consists of 18 sovereign states. Where most of the maritime security issues in the Gulf of Guinea have terrible consequences for the shipping industry.\nMultiple institutional mandates address maritime security in the Gulf of Guinea: the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS). Additionally, maritime security in the Gulf of Guinea is also addressed by the Gulf of Guinea Commission (GGC). \nThere has been a 60% population growth in the Gulf of Guinea since 2000, which consequently leads people to resort to hijacking, kidnapping, robberies, and more due to food shortages. \nClimate change has become a huge problem in the Gulf of Guinea and as a consequence has different Maritime security issues become more pressing. These maritime security crimes are characterized not only by piracy but by a myriad of maritime crimes despite piracy often dominating the conversation on maritime security. The other notable crimes in the Gulf of Guinea are illegal fishing, kidnapping for ransom, drug trafficking, and oil-bunkering. Illegal oil-bunkering consists of the attacking of vessels transporting oil and transferring the oil to the thieves\u2019 own vessel, after which the oil is sold in local and international markets. Illegal oil bunkering at sea is mainly prevalent in the Nigerian waters. \nKidnapping for ransom is also one of the most prevalent maritime crimes in the region. Between 2018 and 2019, the number of crew members that were kidnapped in the Gulf of Guinea increased by 50%, leading the region to account for 90% of global kidnappings at sea. About 92% of the hostage-taking and 73% of kidnappings happening in and around Africa are happening in the Gulf of Guinea. There is also a large issue of drug trafficking in the Gulf of Guinea and the region has over the last few years become a haven for drug trafficking mainly from South America into Europe.\nIllegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing.\nIUU fishing also known as Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing has become a severe problem in the Gulf of Guinea. In 2000 were there reports of 212,800 tons of fish caught and in 2012, this number increased by 9 percent to 232,200 tons.\nIUU consequently creates spillover problems to the social, economic, and environmental life in the Gulf of Guinea. It presents a direct threat to the national security of the coastal states in the Gulf of Guinea. IUU has been linked to multiple issues and forms of organized crime. Some of these crimes are arms trafficking, drug smuggling, forced labor, piracy and more.\nIUU depletes fish stocks in the area and causes issues for fishermen and the local population food security. One of the main issues of IUU is that a lot of the fish that is caught in the Gulf of Guinea is fish that is unreported when caught. This causes overfishing and overfishing causes depleting fisheries all around the region. IUU fishing also becomes a severe issue in the region because it allows fishermen to fish in vessels that are not nationally regulated or managed. Furthermore, can these vessels threaten people's human security due to poor working conditions and poorly regulated boats? Many of the IUU fishing boats are old, rusty, and often in poor condition. \nBoth small-scale and large-scale fisheries often do illegal fishing in the Gulf of Guinea \nIn the Gulf of Guinea can we see severe blue crime spillover effects of IUU through both piracy and human trafficking. Economic activity in the Gulf of Guinea has given rise to maritime piracy in the region. It is evident that in the Gulf of Guinea is there more piracy, forced labor and human trafficking as a consequence of IUU fishing, depleting fish stock and large competition of resources and food.\nFurther Blue Crime Consequences of IUU.\nThere have been many reports of forced labor at sea in the Gulf of Guinea on illegal fishing boats. The EJF reports that through their studies they found that some fishermen and immigrant workers have been forced to work on fishing boats in the Gulf of Guinea for months at a time without access to land. Some of these workers were deployed to sea each day in canoes and in the night where they were forced to return to the mother ship to unload fish. Many illegal fishing boats have operated like such for many years and the workers are often contracted for two years at a time, with no chance to visit home or at times even land in general. \nMany workers are paid in boxes of what the EJF called \"trash fish\" -caught as by-catch- and then the way they would earn money was to further sell this fish. Other reports of forced labor on illegal fishing boats report poor and non-existent safety equipment. Little to no hygiene standards, poor accommodation standards, and very little food. \nEven though piracy in the Gulf of Guinea has dropped since its peak in 2020, is it still a pressing issue in the region. Many pirate groups in the Gulf of Guinea often recruit unemployed and underemployed fishermen. This has become highly lucrative due to poor wages and little to no money going around. Often have these local fishermen been lured into the prospect of quick easy money and as a result sold their fishing boats to other pirates in the Gulf. Depleting fishing stocks encourages fishermen to engage in piracy and more violence in the region is occurring.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the northwest, the Black Volta forms the international borders of the Ivory Coast, Ghana, and Burkina Faso. The Volta flows southward along the Akwapim-Togoland highlands, and empties into the Atlantic Ocean at the Gulf of Guinea at Ada Foah. One of its smaller tributaries, the Oti River, enters Ghana from Togo in the east. The Volta River has been dammed at Akosombo for generating hydroelectricity.

{"id": "42551", "revid": "753665", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42551", "title": "Marty (The Philco Television Playhouse)", "text": "\"Marty\" is a 1953 television play by Paddy Chayefsky. It was telecast live May 24, 1953, on \"The Philco Television Playhouse\" with Rod Steiger in the title role and Nancy Marchand, in her television debut, playing opposite him as Clara. Chayefsky's story of a decent, hard-working Bronx butcher, pining for the company of a woman in his life but despairing of ever finding true love in a relationship, was produced by Fred Coe with associate producer Gordon Duff.\nThe teleplay was adapted into the feature film \"Marty\" starring Ernest Borgnine in 1955. It was directed by Delbert Mann and written by Chayefsky.\nDevelopment.\nIn his collected \"Television Plays\" (1955), Chayefsky recalled:\nI set out in \"Marty\" to write a love story, the most ordinary love story in the world. I didn't want my hero to be handsome, and I didn't want the girl to be pretty. I wanted to write a love story the way it would literally have happened to the kind of people I know... The actor who played Marty, Rod Steiger, is one of the most gifted young actors in the theater, and I owe him a genuine debt of gratitude for all that he contributed to this show.\nThe story originated by chance when Delbert Mann and Chayefsky were rehearsing \"The Reluctant Citizen\" in the old Abbey Hotel's ballroom on West 51st Street, which was also used for Friday night meetings of the Friendship Club. After Chayefsky wandered around and spotted a sign which read, \"Girls, Dance With the Man Who Asks You. Remember, Men Have Feelings, Too\", he told Mann he thought there was a play possibility about a young woman in that type of setting. Speaking to Mann later that day, he told him that such a drama could work better with a man as the central character rather than a woman. Mann told him to go talk to Fred Coe, which Chayefsky did. He pitched the idea by simply saying, \"I want to do a play about a guy who goes to a ballroom.\" Coe told him to start writing it.\nAs Chayefsky was in the middle of writing the script (at this point entitled \"Love Story\"), Coe and Mann unexpectedly rejected another script that was scheduled for production. Coe then called Chayefsky to ask him how the \"Love Story\" script was going, hoping that it could be put into production immediately. At that point, Chayefsky was partway through act 2, and thought he could have it finished in a few weeks, but after talking with Coe he agreed to turn around material in only a few days.\nThe piece was cast and rehearsals got underway with only acts 1 &amp; 2 having been delivered. Chayefsky delivered Act 3 one day later than expected, but still in time to give the cast and crew several days of rehearsal with the complete teleplay.\nChayefsky's original title \"Love Story\" was deemed unacceptable by NBC, who requested the title be changed. Chayefsky's alternative title of \"Marty\" was used instead.\nReception.\nTony Schwartz reviewed the television production in \"The New York Times\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It's the stark, simple portrait of a gentle, lonely man, played by Rod Steiger, who lives with his mother, works as a butcher and longs for a loving relationship as he heads toward middle age. \"I'm 36 years old and I've been lookin' for a girl every Saturday night of my life,\" he tells his best friend. \"I'm a fat little ugly guy and girls don't go for me, that's all.\" It's just that sort of unfettered sentiment that gives the drama such powerful resonance. The story centers mostly on a single Saturday night in Marty's life. After despairing about how to spend it, and then suffering another humiliating rejection when he calls a girl to ask her out, Marty finally decides to attend a lonely hearts social at the Waverly Ballroom. There he meets a girl (Nancy Marchand) who has just been ditched by her blind date\u2014a slick fellow who offers Marty \"five bucks if you take this dog home for me\". Marty approaches her, and in their mutual misery they find a bond. She rejects his first fumbling attempt to kiss her, but mostly in an effort not to seem overeager. Even in the afterglow of a wonderful evening, Marty is subjected the next day to ridicule from his friends, who insist that the girl is a homely loser not worth pursuing. The story hinges on whether he'll follow their advice or follow his own instincts to see her again. The drama is most convincing when it sticks with Marty\u2014and much less so when it drifts off into a stilted subplot about his mother's attempts to convince a sister to move into their household. Because the whole play is less than an hour long (a subsequent film version of the play ran 90 minutes), the second story simply gets in the way.\nThe acclaimed television drama was honored a decade later when the kinescope of the production was selected for showing at the Museum of Modern Art on February 17\u201320, 1963, as part of \"Television USA: Thirteen Seasons\", described by MoMA Film Library curator Richard Griffith as \"a grand retrospective of the best that has been done in American television.\"\nIt was released on VHS by Wood Knapp Video.\nThe original 1953 telecast is commercially available as part of a three-DVD set, \"The Golden Age of Television\" (Criterion Collection), a series which aired on PBS in 1981 with Eva Marie Saint as the host of \"Marty\". It features interviews with Steiger, Marchand and Mann.\nOnly Esther Minciotti, Augusta Ciolli and Joe Mantell repeated their 1953 TV drama roles in the 1955 film adaptation.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "42555", "revid": "35936988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42555", "title": "Jig", "text": "Folk dance and tune\nThe jig (, ) is a form of lively folk dance in compound metre, as well as the accompanying dance tune. It first gained popularity across the British Isles in the 16th-century, and was adopted on mainland Europe where it eventually became the final movement of the mature Baroque dance suite (the French gigue; Italian and Spanish giga). Today it is most associated with Irish dance music, Scottish country dance, French Canadian traditionnal music and dance (trad) and the M\u00e9tis people in Canada. Jigs were originally in quadruple compound metre, (e.g., time), but have been adapted to a variety of time signatures, by which they are often classified into groups, including double jigs (), slip jigs () and single jigs ().\nOrigins.\nThe term \"jig\" was probably derived from the French \"giguer\", meaning 'to jump' or the Italian \"giga\". The use of 'jig' in Irish dance derives from the Irish \"jige\u00e1nnai\", itself borrowed from the Old English \"giga\" meaning 'old dance'. It was known as a dance in 16th-century England, often in time, and the term was used for a post-play entertainment featuring dance in early modern England, but which 'probably employed a great variety\nof dances, solo (suitable for jigs), paired, round, country or courtly'; in Playford's \"Dancing Master\" (1651) 'the dance game in \"Kemps Jegg\" is a typical scenario from a dramatic jig and it is likely that the combination of dance metre for steps and non-metrical passages for pantomime indicates how a solo or ensemble jig might have been danced by stage players.' Later the dance began to be associated with music particularly in time, and with slip jigs time.\nIreland and Scotland.\nDuring the middle of the 16th century the dance was adopted in Ireland and in the 17th century Scotland, where it was widely adapted, and the jig is now most often associated with these countries, especially Ireland. The jig is second in popularity only to the reel in traditional Irish dance; it is popular but somewhat less common in Scottish country dance music. It is transcribed in compound metre, being time. The most common structure of a jig is two eight-bar parts, performing two different steps, each once on the right foot, and one on the left foot. As with most other types of dance tunes in Irish music, at a session or a dance it is common for two or more jigs to be strung together in a set, flowing on without interruption.\nIn Irish step dance.\nThe following distinction is primarily observed in modern competitive Irish dance and should not be confused with the general notion of how the jigs are played and classified among traditional Irish musicians.\nLight jigs.\nA light jig is the second-fastest of all jigs. The performer's feet rarely leave the ground for long, as the step is fast, typically performed at a speed around 116 at feiseanna. There are several light jig steps, varying with each dance school, but the rising step, or the rise and grind, is standard in almost all light jigs. The right side version of the rising step is performed by putting weight on the left foot, lifting the right foot off the ground then hopping on the left foot once. Hop on the left foot again, bringing the right foot back behind the left foot and then shift the weight onto the right foot, leaving the left foot in the air. Dancers use the phrase \"hop, hop back\" for these three movements, and there is a slight pause between the hop, and hop back. The next movement is a hop on the right foot. Then shift the weight, left-right-left-right. The phrase for this whole movement is: \"hop, hop back, hop back 2-3.\" To do the step on the left foot, reverse the left and right directions.\nSlip jigs.\nSlip jigs are in time. Because of the longer measures, they are longer than the reel and the light jig, with the same number of bars to the music. The dance is performed high on the toes, and is often considered the \"ballet of Irish dance\" because of its graceful movements that seem to slip the performers across the floor. Slip jigs are performed at a speed of 113 bpm at feiseanna.\nSingle and double jigs.\nSingle jigs should not be confused with slides; they are the least common of the jigs, performed in ghillies, in a or less commonly a time. Musically, the single jig tends to follow the pattern of a quarter note followed by an eighth note (twice per bar), whereas the pattern for the double jig is three eighth notes twice per bar.\nHop jigs.\nHop jigs are the fastest of all jigs next to light jigs, but the term \"hop jig\" causes some confusion, as some people use it for a single jig, while others use this term to refer to a tune in time.\nAmong the latter, some do not distinguish it from a slip jig, while some reserve the term to a slip jig variant that has special characteristics, in particular an emphasis on quarter note\u2013eighth note pairs.\nTreble jigs.\nTreble jigs (also called the hard or heavy jig) are performed in hard shoes, and also to a time metre. They are characterized by stomps, trebles, and clicks. Many set dances are performed in treble jig time, a few being Drunken Gauger, Blackthorn Stick, The Three Sea Captains, and St Patrick's Day. Two types of treble jigs are performed at feiseanna: the traditional and non-traditional (slow) treble jigs. Beginners will do a treble jig at traditional speed (92 bpm), while more advanced dancers will dance the non-traditional (slow) treble jig at 72 bpm.\nStraight and sand jigs.\nIn 19th-century America, the jig was the name adopted for a form of step dancing developed by enslaved African-Americans and later adopted by minstrel show performers. Danced to five-string banjo or fiddle tunes in or metre played at schottische tempo, the minstrel jig (also called the \"straight jig\" to distinguish it from Irish dances) was characterized by syncopated rhythm and eccentric movements. Jig dancers employed a repertoire of \"hits\" on the heel or toe, \"hops\" on one foot, \"springs\" off both feet as well as various slides and shuffles. The most famous early jig dancer was Master Juba, an African-American who inspired a host of white imitators, many of whom performed in blackface. John Diamond, an Irish-American who competed with Master Juba in a series of \"challenge dances\", was among the most prominent of these white minstrel jig dancers. Minstrel jigs, as well as clogs and breakdowns, were crucial to the evolution of 20th-century tap and soft-shoe dancing.\nA variant of the straight jig was the \"sand jig\" or \"sand dance\", performed as a series of shuffles and slides on a sand-strewn stage. The most prominent sand jiggers of the 19th century were two women, both born in New York in 1855: Buffalo native Kitty O'Neil and her Manhattan-born rival Kitty Sharpe. Sand dancing was a staple of minstrelsy, variety and vaudeville, and was kept alive in later decades largely by African-American tap dancers, including John Bubbles, Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson, Sammy Davis Jr., Harriet Browne and, most prominently, Howard \"Sandman\" Sims.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As leader of the Soviet Union, he stunned the world by denouncing his predecessor Joseph Stalin, embarking on a campaign of de-Stalinization, and presiding over the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.\nNikita Khrushchev was born in a village in western Russia on 15 April 1894. He was employed as a metal worker during his youth and was a political commissar in the Russian Civil War. Under the sponsorship of Lazar Kaganovich, Khrushchev rose through the ranks of the Soviet hierarchy. During Stalin's rule, he actively supported the Great Purge and approved thousands of arrests. In 1938, Stalin sent him to govern the Ukrainian SSR, and he continued the purges there. During the Great Patriotic War, Khrushchev was again a commissar, serving as an intermediary between Stalin and his generals. He was also present at the defense of Stalingrad, a fact in which he took great pride. After the war, Khrushchev returned to Ukraine before being recalled to Moscow as one of Stalin's close advisers.\nOn 5 March 1953, the death of Stalin triggered a power struggle in which Khrushchev ultimately emerged victorious upon consolidating his authority as First Secretary of the party's Central Committee. On 25 February 1956, at the 20th Party Congress, he delivered the \"Secret Speech\", which denounced Stalin's purges and ushered in a less repressive era in the Soviet Union. His domestic policies, aimed at bettering the lives of ordinary citizens, were often ineffective, especially in agriculture. Hoping eventually to rely on missiles for national defense, Khrushchev ordered major cuts in conventional forces. Despite such cuts, Khrushchev's time in office saw the tensest years of the Cold War, culminating in the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.\nAs leader of the Soviet Union, Nikita Khrushchev enjoyed considerable popularity during the late 1950s due to the successful launching of Sputnik in 1957 as well as favorable outcomes in the 1956 Suez Crisis, 1957 Syrian Crisis, and 1960 U-2 incident. However, by the early 1960s, Khrushchev's hold on power had been significantly weakened by his domestic policy failures and mishandling of the Cuban Missile Crisis. As a result, his rivals consolidated enough support among the \"nomenklatura\" to oust him from the Soviet leadership on 14 October 1964. Following his forced retirement, Khrushchev spent much of his time composing a series of lengthy memoirs which were smuggled to the West and published in part in 1970. He died the next year in his dacha.\nEarly life.\nNikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev was born on 15 April 1894 in Kalinovka, a Russian village in what is now Khomutovsky District, Kursk Oblast, near the present Ukrainian border. The village was part of Dmitriyevsky Uyezd in Kursk Governorate at the time of his birth. His parents, Sergei Khrushchev and Kseniya Khrushcheva, were poor Russian peasants, and had a daughter two years Nikita's junior, Irina. Sergei Khrushchev was employed in a number of positions in the Donbas area of far eastern Ukraine, working as a railwayman, as a miner, and laboring in a brick factory. Wages were much higher in the Donbas than in the Kursk region, and Sergei Khrushchev generally left his family in Kalinovka, returning when he had enough money. When Nikita was six or seven, the family moved to Yuzovka (now Donetsk) for about a year before returning to Kalinovka.\nKalinovka was a peasant village; Khrushchev's teacher, Lydia Shevchenko, later stated that she had never seen a village as poor. Nikita worked as a herdsboy from an early age. He was schooled for a total of four years, part in the village school and part under Shevchenko's tutelage in Kalinovka's state school. According to Khrushchev's memoirs, Shevchenko was a freethinker who upset the villagers by not attending church, and when her brother visited, she gave Khrushchev books which had been banned by the Imperial Government. She urged Nikita to seek further education, but family finances did not permit this.\nIn 1908, Sergei Khrushchev moved to the Donbas city of Yuzovka; fourteen-year-old Nikita followed later that year, while Kseniya Khrushcheva and her daughter came after. Yuzovka, which was renamed Stalino in 1924 and Donetsk in 1961, was at the heart of one of the most industrialized areas of the Russian Empire. After working briefly in other fields, Khrushchev's parents found Nikita a place as a metal fitter's apprentice. Upon completing that apprenticeship, the teenage Khrushchev was hired by a factory. He lost that job when he collected money for the families of the victims of the Lena Goldfields massacre, and was hired to mend underground equipment by a mine in nearby Ruchenkovo, where his father was the union organizer, and he helped distribute copies and organize public readings of \"Pravda\". He later stated that he considered emigrating to the United States for better wages, but did not do so. He later recalled his working days:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I started working as soon as I learned how to walk. Until the age of fifteen, I worked as a shepherd. I tended, as the foreigners say when they use the Russian language, \"the little cows,\" I was a sheepherder, I herded cows for a capitalist, and that was before I was fifteen. After that, I worked at a factory for a German, and I worked in a French-owned mine, I worked at a Belgian-owned chemical factory, and [now] I'm the Prime Minister of the great Soviet state. And I am in no way ashamed of my past because all work is worthy of respect. Work as such cannot be dirty, it is only conscience that can be.\u2014\u200a\nWhen World War I broke out in 1914, Khrushchev was exempt from conscription because he was a skilled metal worker. He was employed by a workshop that serviced ten mines, and he was involved in several strikes that demanded higher pay, better working conditions, and an end to the war. In 1914, he married Yefrosinia Pisareva, daughter of the lift operator at the Rutchenkovo mine. In 1915, they had a daughter, Yulia, and in 1917, a son, Leonid.\nAfter the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II in 1917, the new Russian Provisional Government in Petrograd had little influence over Ukraine. Khrushchev was elected to the worker's council (or \"soviet\") in Rutchenkovo, and in May he became its chairman. He did not join the Bolsheviks until 1918, a year in which the Russian Civil War, between the Bolsheviks and a coalition of opponents known as the White Army, began in earnest. His biographer, William Taubman, suggests that Khrushchev's delay in affiliating himself with the Bolsheviks was because he felt closer to the Mensheviks who prioritized economic progress, whereas the Bolsheviks sought political power. In his memoirs, Khrushchev indicated that he waited because there were many groups, and it was difficult to keep them all straight.\nIn March 1918, as the Bolshevik government concluded a separate peace with the Central Powers, the Germans occupied the Donbas and Khrushchev fled to Kalinovka. In late 1918 or early 1919, he was mobilized into the Red Army as a political commissar. The post of political commissar had recently been introduced as the Bolsheviks came to rely less on worker activists and more on military recruits; its functions included indoctrination of recruits in the tenets of Bolshevism, and promoting troop morale and battle readiness. Beginning as commissar to a construction platoon, Khrushchev rose to become commissar to a construction battalion and was sent from the front for a two-month political course. The young commissar came under fire many times, though many of the war stories he would tell in later life dealt more with cultural awkwardness rather than combat. In 1921, the civil war ended, and Khrushchev was demobilized and assigned as commissar to a labor brigade in the Donbas, where he and his men lived in poor conditions.\nThe wars had caused widespread devastation and famine, and one of the victims was Khrushchev's wife, Yefrosinia, who died of typhus in Kalinovka while Khrushchev was in the army. The commissar returned for the funeral and, loyal to his Bolshevik principles, refused to allow his wife's coffin to enter the local church. With the only way into the churchyard through the church, he had the coffin lifted and passed over the fence into the burial ground, shocking the village.\nParty official.\nDonbas years.\nThrough the intervention of a friend, Khrushchev was assigned in 1921 as assistant director for political affairs for the Rutchenkovo mine in the Donbas region, where he had previously worked. There were as yet few Bolsheviks in the area. At that time, the movement was split by Lenin's New Economic Policy. While Khrushchev's responsibility lay in political affairs, he involved himself in the practicalities of resuming full production at the mine after the chaos of the war years. He helped restart the machines (key parts and papers had been removed by the pre-Soviet mine-owners) and he wore his old mine outfit for inspection tours.\nKhrushchev was highly successful at the Rutchenkovo mine, and in mid-1922 he was offered the directorship of the nearby Pastukhov mine. However, he refused the offer, seeking to be assigned to the newly established technical college (\"tekhnikum\") in Yuzovka, though his superiors were reluctant to let him go. As he had only four years of formal schooling, he applied to the training program (\"rabfak\", short for \u0420\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0439 \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0435\u0442 / Rabotchyi Fakultyet, or Worker's Faculty) attached to the \"tekhnikum\" that was designed to bring undereducated students to high-school level, a prerequisite for entry into the \"tekhnikum\". While enrolled in the \"rabfak\", Khrushchev continued his work at the Rutchenkovo mine.\nOne of his teachers later described him as a poor student. He was more successful in advancing in the Communist Party; soon after his admission to the \"rabfak\" in August 1922, he was appointed party secretary of the entire \"tekhnikum\", and became a member of the bureau\u2014the governing council\u2014of the party committee for the town of Yuzovka (renamed Stalino in 1924). He briefly joined supporters of Leon Trotsky against those of Joseph Stalin over the question of party democracy. All of these activities left him with little time for his schoolwork, and while he later said he had finished his \"rabfak\" studies, it is unclear whether this was true.\nAccording to William Taubman, Khrushchev's studies were aided by Nina Petrovna Kukharchuk, a well-educated Party organizer and daughter of well-to-do Ukrainian peasants. The family was poor, according to Nina's own recollections. The two lived together as husband and wife for the rest of Khrushchev's life, though they never registered their marriage. They had three children together: daughter Rada was born in 1929, son Sergei in 1935 and daughter Elena in 1937.\nIn mid-1925, Khrushchev was appointed Party secretary of the Petrovo-Marinsky \"raikom\", or district, near Stalino. The \"raikom\" was about in area, and Khrushchev was constantly on the move throughout his domain, taking an interest in even minor matters. In late 1925, Khrushchev was elected a non-voting delegate to the 14th Congress of the USSR Communist Party in Moscow.\nKaganovich prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\nKhrushchev met Lazar Kaganovich as early as 1917. In 1925, Kaganovich became Party head in Ukraine and Khrushchev, falling under his patronage, was rapidly promoted. He was appointed second in command of Stalin's party apparatus in late 1926. Within nine months his superior, Konstantin Moiseyenko, was ousted, which, according to Taubman, was due to Khrushchev's instigation. Kaganovich transferred Khrushchev to Kharkov, then the capital of Ukraine, as head of the Organizational Department of the Ukrainian Party's Central Committee. In 1928, Khrushchev was transferred to Kiev, where he served as head of the organizational department, second-in-command of the Party organization there.\nIn 1929, Khrushchev again sought to further his education, following Kaganovich (now in the Kremlin as a close associate of Stalin) to Moscow and enrolling in the Stalin Industrial Academy. Khrushchev never completed his studies there, but his career in the Party flourished. When the school's Party cell elected a number of rightists to an upcoming district Party conference, the cell was attacked in \"Pravda\". Khrushchev emerged victorious in the ensuing power struggle, becoming Party secretary of the school, arranging for the delegates to be withdrawn, and, afterward, purging the cell of the rightists. Khrushchev rose rapidly through the Party ranks, first becoming Party leader for the Bauman district, site of the academy, before taking the same position in the Krasnopresnensky district, the capital's largest and most important. By 1932, Khrushchev had become second in command, behind Kaganovich, of the Moscow city Party organization, and in 1934, he became Party leader for the city and a member of the Party's Central Committee. Khrushchev attributed his rapid rise to his acquaintance with fellow Academy student Nadezhda Alliluyeva, Stalin's wife. In his memoirs, Khrushchev stated that Alliluyeva spoke well of him to her husband. His biographer, William Tompson, downplays the possibility, stating that Khrushchev was too low in the Party hierarchy to enjoy Stalin's patronage and that if influence was brought to bear on Khrushchev's career at this stage, it was by Kaganovich.\nWhile head of the Moscow city organization, Khrushchev superintended the construction of the Moscow Metro, a highly expensive undertaking, with Kaganovich in overall charge. Faced with an already-announced opening date of 7 November 1934, Khrushchev took considerable risks in the construction and spent much of his time down in the tunnels. When the inevitable accidents did occur, they were depicted as heroic sacrifices in a great cause. The Metro did not open until 1 May 1935, but Khrushchev received the Order of Lenin for his role in its construction. Later that year, he was selected as First Secretary of the Moscow Regional Committee which was responsible for Moscow \"oblast\", a province with a population of 11\u00a0million.\nInvolvement in purges.\nStalin's office records show meetings at which Khrushchev was present as early as 1932. The two increasingly built a good relationship. Khrushchev greatly admired the dictator and treasured informal meetings with him and invitations to Stalin's \"dacha\", while Stalin felt warm affection for his young subordinate. Beginning in 1934, Stalin began a campaign of political repression known as the Great Purge, during which many were executed or sent to the Gulag. Central to this campaign were the Moscow Trials, a series of show trials of the purged top leaders of the party and the military. In 1936, as the trials proceeded, Khrushchev expressed his vehement support:\nEveryone who rejoices in the successes achieved in our country, the victories of our party led by the great Stalin, will find only one word suitable for the mercenary, fascist dogs of the Trotskyite-Zinovievite gang. That word is execution. \nKhrushchev assisted in the purge of many friends and colleagues in the Moscow \"oblast\". Of 38\u00a0top Party officials in Moscow city and province, 35 were killed\u2014the three survivors were transferred to other parts of the USSR. Of the 146\u00a0Party secretaries of cities and districts outside Moscow city in the province, only 10 survived the purges. In his memoirs, Khrushchev noted that almost everyone who worked with him was arrested. By Party protocol, Khrushchev was required to approve these arrests and did little or nothing to save his friends and colleagues.\nParty leaders were given numerical quotas of \"enemies\" to be turned in and arrested. In June 1937, the Politburo set a quota of 35,000\u00a0enemies to be arrested in Moscow province; 5,000 of these were to be executed. In reply, Khrushchev asked that 2,000\u00a0wealthy peasants, or \"kulaks\" living in Moscow be killed in part fulfillment of the quota. In any event, only two weeks after receiving the order, Khrushchev was able to report to Stalin that 41,305\u00a0\"criminal and \"kulak\" elements\" had been arrested. Of the arrestees, according to Khrushchev, 8,500 deserved execution.\nKhrushchev had no reason to think himself immune from the purges, and in 1937, confessed his own 1923 dalliance with Trotskyism to Kaganovich, who, according to Khrushchev, \"blanched\" (for his prot\u00e9g\u00e9's sins could affect his own standing) and advised him to tell Stalin. The dictator took the confession in his stride, and, after initially advising Khrushchev to keep it quiet, suggested that Khrushchev tell his tale to the Moscow party conference. Khrushchev did so, to applause, and was immediately reelected to his post. Khrushchev related in his memoirs that he was also denounced by an arrested colleague. Stalin told Khrushchev of the accusation personally. Khrushchev speculated in his memoirs that had Stalin doubted his reaction, he would have been categorized as an enemy of the people then and there. Nonetheless, Khrushchev became a candidate member of the Politburo on 14 January 1938 and a full member in March 1939.\nIn late 1937, Stalin appointed Khrushchev as head of the Communist Party in Ukraine. Khrushchev left Moscow for Kiev, again the Ukrainian capital, in January 1938. Ukraine had been the site of extensive purges, with the murdered including professors in Stalino whom Khrushchev greatly respected. The high ranks of the Party were not immune; the Central Committee of Ukraine was so devastated that it could not convene a quorum. After Khrushchev's arrival, the pace of arrests accelerated. All but one member of the Ukrainian Politburo Organizational Bureau and Secretariat were arrested. Almost all government officials and Red Army commanders were replaced. During the first few months after Khrushchev's arrival, almost everyone arrested was executed.\nBiographer William Taubman suggested that because Khrushchev was again unsuccessfully denounced while in Kiev, he must have known that some of the denunciations were not true and that innocent people were suffering. In 1939, Khrushchev addressed the Fourteenth Ukrainian Party Congress, saying \"Comrades, we must unmask and relentlessly destroy all enemies of the people. But we must not allow a single honest Bolshevik to be harmed.\"\nWorld War II.\nInvasion of Poland and subsequent occupation.\nWhen Soviet troops, pursuant to the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, invaded the eastern portion of Poland on 17 September 1939, Khrushchev accompanied the troops at Stalin's direction. A large number of ethnic Ukrainians lived in the invaded area, much of which today forms the western portion of Ukraine. Many inhabitants initially welcomed the invasion, though they hoped that they would eventually become independent. Khrushchev's role was to ensure that the occupied areas voted for union with the USSR. Through a combination of propaganda, deception as to what was being voted for, and outright fraud, the Soviets ensured that the assemblies elected in the new territories would unanimously petition for union with the USSR. When the new assemblies did so, their petitions were granted by the USSR Supreme Soviet, and Western Ukraine became a part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic on 1 November 1939. Clumsy actions by the Soviets, such as staffing Western Ukrainian organizations with Eastern Ukrainians, and giving confiscated land to collective farms (\"kolkhozes\") rather than to peasants, soon alienated Western Ukrainians, damaging Khrushchev's efforts to achieve unity.\nWar against Germany.\nWhen Nazi Germany invaded the USSR, in June 1941, Khrushchev was still at his post in Kiev. Stalin appointed him a political commissar, and Khrushchev served on a number of fronts as an intermediary between the local military commanders and the political rulers in Moscow. Stalin used Khrushchev to keep commanders on a tight leash, while the commanders sought to have him influence Stalin.\nAs the Germans advanced, Khrushchev worked with the military to defend and save Kiev. Handicapped by orders from Stalin that under no circumstances should the city be abandoned, the Red Army was soon encircled by the Germans. While the Germans stated they took 655,000\u00a0prisoners, according to the Soviets, 150,541\u00a0men out of 677,085 escaped. Primary sources differ on Khrushchev's involvement. According to Marshal Georgy Zhukov, writing some years after Khrushchev fired and disgraced him in 1957, Khrushchev persuaded Stalin not to evacuate troops from Kiev. However, Khrushchev noted in his memoirs that he and Marshal Semyon Budyonny proposed redeploying Soviet forces to avoid the encirclement until Marshal Semyon Timoshenko arrived from Moscow with orders for the troops to hold their positions. Early Khrushchev biographer Mark Frankland suggested that Khrushchev's faith in his leader was first shaken by the Red Army's setbacks. Khrushchev stated in his memoirs:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;But let me return to the enemy breakthrough in the Kiev area, the encirclement of our group, and the destruction of the 37th Army. Later, the Fifth Army also perished\u00a0... All of this was senseless, and from the military point of view, a display of ignorance, incompetence, and illiteracy.\u00a0... There you have the result of not taking a step backward. We were unable to save these troops because we didn't withdraw them, and as a result, we simply lost them.\u00a0... And yet it was possible to allow this not to happen.\nIn 1942, Khrushchev was on the Southwest Front, and he and Timoshenko proposed a massive counteroffensive in the Kharkov area. Stalin approved only part of the plan, but 640,000\u00a0Red Army soldiers were involved in the offensive. The Germans, however, had deduced that the Soviets were likely to attack at Kharkov, and set a trap. Beginning on 12 May 1942, the Soviet offensive initially appeared successful, but within five days the Germans had driven deep into the Soviet flanks, and the Red Army troops were in danger of being cut off. Stalin refused to halt the offensive, and the Red Army divisions were soon encircled by the Germans. The USSR lost about 267,000\u00a0soldiers, including more than 200,000 captured, and Stalin demoted Timoshenko and recalled Khrushchev to Moscow. While Stalin hinted at arresting and executing Khrushchev, he allowed the commissar to return to the front by sending him to Stalingrad.\nKhrushchev reached the Stalingrad Front in August 1942, soon after the start of the battle for the city. His role in the Stalingrad defense was not major\u2014General Vasily Chuikov, who led the city's defense, mentions Khrushchev only briefly in a memoir published while Khrushchev was premier\u2014but to the end of his life, he was proud of his role. Though he visited Stalin in Moscow on occasion, he remained in Stalingrad for much of the battle and was nearly killed at least once. He proposed a counterattack, only to find that Georgy Zhukov and other generals had already planned Operation Uranus, a plan to break out from Soviet positions and encircle and destroy the Germans; it was being kept secret. Before \"Uranus\" was launched, Khrushchev spent much time checking on troop readiness and morale, interrogating Nazi prisoners, and recruiting some for propaganda purposes.\nSoon after Stalingrad, Khrushchev met with personal tragedy, as his son Leonid, a fighter pilot, was apparently shot down and killed in action on 11 March 1943. The circumstances of Leonid's death remain obscure and controversial, as none of his fellow fliers stated that they witnessed him being shot down, nor was his plane found or body recovered. One theory has Leonid surviving the crash and collaborating with the Germans, and when he was recaptured by the Soviets, Stalin ordering him shot despite Khrushchev pleading for his life. This supposed killing is used to explain why Khrushchev later denounced Stalin. While there is no supporting evidence for this account in Soviet files, some historians allege that Leonid Khrushchev's file was tampered with after the war. In later years, Leonid Khrushchev's wingmate stated that he saw his plane disintegrate, but did not report it. Khrushchev biographer Taubman speculates that this omission was most likely to avoid the possibility of being seen as complicit in the death of the son of a Politburo member. In mid-1943, Leonid's wife, Liuba Khrushcheva, was arrested on accusations of spying and sentenced to five years in a labor camp, and her son (by another relationship), Tolya, was placed in orphanages. Leonid's daughter, Yulia, was raised by Nikita Khrushchev and his wife.\nAfter \"Uranus\" forced the Germans into retreat, Khrushchev served on other fronts of the war. He was attached to Soviet troops at the Battle of Kursk, in July 1943, which turned back the last major German offensive on Soviet soil. Khrushchev related that he interrogated an SS defector, learning that the Germans intended an attack\u2014a claim dismissed by his biographer Taubman as \"almost certainly exaggerated\". He accompanied Soviet troops as they took Kiev in November 1943, entering the shattered city as Soviet forces drove out German troops. As Soviet forces met with greater success, driving the Nazis westwards towards Germany, Nikita Khrushchev became increasingly involved in reconstruction work in Ukraine. He was appointed Premier of the Ukrainian SSR in addition to his earlier party post, one of the rare instances in which the Ukrainian party and civil leader posts were held by one person.\nAccording to Khrushchev biographer William Tompson, it is difficult to assess Khrushchev's war record, since he most often acted as part of a military council, and it is not possible to know the extent to which he influenced decisions. However, Tompson points to the fact that the few mentions of Khrushchev in military memoirs published during the Brezhnev era were generally favorable, at a time when it was \"barely possible to mention Khrushchev in print in any context\". Tompson suggests that these favorable mentions indicate that military officers held Khrushchev in high regard.\nRise to power.\nReturn to Ukraine.\nAlmost all of Ukraine had been occupied by the Germans, and Khrushchev returned to his domain in late 1943 to find devastation. Ukraine's industry had been destroyed, and agriculture faced critical shortages. Even though millions of Ukrainians had been taken to Germany as workers or prisoners of war, there was insufficient housing for those who remained. One out of every six Ukrainians were killed in World War II.\nKhrushchev sought to reconstruct Ukraine and complete the interrupted work of imposing the Soviet system on it, though he hoped that the purges of the 1930s would not recur. As Ukraine was recovered militarily, conscription was imposed; 750,000\u00a0men aged between nineteen and fifty were sent to join the Red Army. Other Ukrainians joined partisan forces, seeking an independent Ukraine. Khrushchev rushed from district to district through Ukraine, urging the depleted labor force to greater efforts. He made a short visit to his birthplace of Kalinovka, finding a starving population, with only a third of the men who had joined the Red Army having returned. Khrushchev did what he could to assist his hometown. Despite Khrushchev's efforts, in 1945, Ukrainian industry was at only a quarter of pre-war levels, and the harvest actually dropped from that of 1944, when the entire territory of Ukraine had not yet been retaken.\nIn an effort to increase agricultural production, the \"kolkhozes\" (collective farms) were empowered to expel residents who were not pulling their weight. \"Kolkhoz\" leaders used this as an excuse to expel their personal enemies, invalids, and the elderly, sending them to the eastern parts of the Soviet Union. Khrushchev viewed this policy as very effective and recommended its adoption elsewhere to Stalin. He also worked to impose collectivization on Western Ukraine. Lack of resources and armed resistance by partisans slowed the process. The partisans, many of whom fought as the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), were gradually defeated, as Soviet police and military reported killing 110,825 \"bandits\" and capturing a quarter million more between 1944 and 1946. About 600,000\u00a0Western Ukrainians were arrested between 1944 and 1952, with one-third executed and the remainder imprisoned or exiled to the east.\nThe war years of 1944 and 1945 had seen poor harvests, and 1946 saw intense drought strike Ukraine and Western Russia. Despite this, collective and state farms were required to turn over 52% of the harvest to the government. The Soviet government sought to collect as much grain as possible to supply communist allies in Eastern Europe. Khrushchev set the quotas at a high level, leading Stalin to expect an unrealistically large quantity of grain from Ukraine. Food was rationed\u2014but non-agricultural rural workers throughout the USSR were given no ration cards. The inevitable starvation was largely confined to remote rural regions and was little noticed outside the USSR. Khrushchev, realizing the desperate situation in late 1946, repeatedly appealed to Stalin for aid, to be met with anger and resistance. When letters to Stalin had no effect, Khrushchev flew to Moscow and made his case in person. Stalin finally gave Ukraine limited food aid, and money to set up free soup kitchens. However, Khrushchev's political standing had been damaged, and in February 1947, Stalin suggested that Lazar Kaganovich be sent to Ukraine to \"help\" Khrushchev. The following month, the Ukrainian Central Committee removed Khrushchev as party leader in favor of Kaganovich, while retaining him as premier.\nSoon after Kaganovich arrived in Kiev, Khrushchev fell ill and was barely seen until September 1947. In his memoirs, Khrushchev indicates he had pneumonia; some biographers have theorized that Khrushchev's illness was entirely political, out of fear that his loss of position was the first step towards downfall and demise. However, Khrushchev's children remembered their father as having been seriously ill. Once Khrushchev was able to get out of bed, he and his family took their first vacation since before the war, to a beachfront resort in Latvia. Khrushchev, though, soon broke the beach routine with duck-hunting trips, and a visit to the new Soviet Kaliningrad, where he toured factories and quarries. By the end of 1947, Kaganovich had been recalled to Moscow and the recovered Khrushchev had been restored to the First Secretaryship. He then resigned the Ukrainian premiership in favor of Demyan Korotchenko, Khrushchev's prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\nKhrushchev's final years in Ukraine were generally peaceful, with industry recovering, Soviet forces overcoming the partisans, and 1947 and 1948 seeing better-than-expected harvests. Collectivization advanced in Western Ukraine, and Khrushchev implemented more policies that encouraged collectivization and discouraged private farms. These sometimes backfired, however: a tax on private livestock holdings led to peasants slaughtering their stock. With the idea of eliminating differences in attitude between town and countryside and transforming the peasantry into a \"rural proletariat\", Khrushchev conceived the idea of the \"agro-town\". Rather than agricultural workers living close to farms, they would live further away in larger towns which would offer municipal services such as utilities and libraries. He completed only one such town before his December 1949 return to Moscow; he dedicated it to Stalin as a 70th birthday present.\nIn his memoirs, Khrushchev spoke highly of Ukraine:\nI'll say that the Ukrainian people treated me well. I recall warmly the years I spent there. This was a period full of responsibilities, but pleasant because it brought satisfaction\u00a0... But far be it from me to inflate my significance. The entire Ukrainian people was exerting great efforts\u00a0... I attribute Ukraine's successes to the Ukrainian people as a whole. I won't elaborate further on this theme, but in principle, it's very easy to demonstrate. I'm Russian myself, and I don't want to offend the Russians.\nStalin's final years.\nFrom mid-December 1949, Khrushchev served as head of the Party in Moscow city and province. His biographer Taubman suggests that Stalin most likely recalled Khrushchev to Moscow to balance the influence of Georgy Malenkov and security chief Lavrentiy Beria, who were widely seen as Stalin's heirs. The aging leader rarely called Politburo meetings. Instead, much of the high-level work of government took place at dinners hosted by Stalin for his inner circle of Beria, Malenkov, Khrushchev, Kaganovich, Kliment Voroshilov, Vyacheslav Molotov, and Nikolai Bulganin. Khrushchev took early naps so that he would not fall asleep in Stalin's presence; he noted in his memoirs, \"Things went badly for those who dozed off at Stalin's table.\"\nIn 1950, Khrushchev began a large-scale housing program for Moscow. Five- or six-story apartment buildings became ubiquitous throughout the Soviet Union. Khrushchev had prefabricated reinforced concrete used, greatly speeding up construction. These structures were completed at triple the construction rate of Moscow housing from 1946 to 1950, lacked elevators or balconies, and were nicknamed \"khrushchyovka\" by the public, but because of their shoddy workmanship sometimes disparagingly called \"Khrushchoba\", combining Khrushchev's name with the Russian word \"trushchoba\", meaning \"slum\". In 1995, almost 60,000,000\u00a0residents of the former Soviet Union still lived in these buildings.\nIn his new positions, Khrushchev continued his \"kolkhoz\" consolidation scheme, which decreased the number of collective farms in Moscow Oblast by about 70%. This resulted in farms that were too large for one chairman to manage effectively. Khrushchev also sought to implement his agro-town proposal, but when his lengthy speech on the subject was published in \"Pravda\" in March 1951, Stalin disapproved of it. The periodical quickly published a note stating that Khrushchev's speech was merely a proposal, not policy. In April, the Politburo disavowed the agro-town proposal. Khrushchev feared that Stalin would remove him from office, but the leader mocked Khrushchev, then allowed the episode to pass.\nOn 1 March 1953, Stalin had a massive stroke. As terrified doctors attempted treatment, Khrushchev and his colleagues engaged in an intense discussion as to the new government. On 5 March, Stalin died.\nKhrushchev later reflected on Stalin:\nStalin called everyone who didn't agree with him an \"enemy of the people.\" He said that they wanted to restore the old order, and for this purpose, \"the enemies of the people\" had linked up with the forces of reaction internationally. As a result, several hundred thousand honest people perished. Everyone lived in fear in those days. Everyone expected that at any moment there would be a knock on the door in the middle of the night and that knock on the door would prove fatal\u00a0... [P]eople not to Stalin's liking were annihilated, honest party members, irreproachable people, loyal and hard workers for our cause who had gone through the school of revolutionary struggle under Lenin's leadership. This was utter and complete arbitrariness. And now is all this to be forgiven and forgotten? Never!\nStruggle for power.\nOn 6 March 1953, Stalin's death was announced, as was the new leadership. Malenkov was the new Chairman of the Council of Ministers, with Beria (who consolidated his hold over the security agencies), Kaganovich, Bulganin, and former Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov as first vice-chairmen. Those members of the Presidium of the Central Committee who had been recently promoted by Stalin were demoted. Khrushchev was relieved of his duties as Party head for Moscow to concentrate on unspecified duties in the Party's Central Committee. \"The New York Times\" listed Malenkov and Beria first and second among the ten-man Presidium\u2014and Khrushchev last.\nHowever, Malenkov resigned from the secretariat of the Central Committee on 14 March. This came due to concerns that he was acquiring too much power. The major beneficiary was Khrushchev. His name appeared atop a revised list of secretaries\u2014indicating that he was now in charge of the party. The Central Committee formally elected him First Secretary in September.\nAfter Stalin's death, Beria launched a number of reforms. According to Taubman, \"unparalleled in his cynicism, he [Beria] did not let ideology stand in his way. Had he prevailed, he would almost certainly have exterminated his colleagues, if only to prevent them from liquidating him. In the meantime, however, his burst of reforms rivaled Khrushchev's and in some ways even Gorbachev's\". One proposal, which was adopted, was an amnesty which eventually led to the freeing of over a million non-political prisoners. Another, which was not adopted, was to release East Germany into a united, neutral Germany in exchange for compensation from the West\u2014a proposal considered by Khrushchev to be anti-communist. Khrushchev allied with Malenkov to block many of Beria's proposals, while the two slowly picked up support from other Presidium members. Their campaign against Beria was aided by fears that Beria was planning a military coup, and, according to Khrushchev in his memoirs, by the conviction that \"Beria is getting his knives ready for us.\" The key move by Khrushchev and Malenkov was to lure two of Beria's most powerful deputy ministers, Sergei Kruglov and Ivan Serov, to betray their boss. This allowed Khrushchev and Malenkov to arrest Beria as Beria belatedly discovered he had lost control of Ministry of Interior troops and the troops of the Kremlin guard. On 26 June 1953, Beria was arrested at a Presidium meeting, following extensive military preparations by Khrushchev and his allies. Beria was tried in secret and executed in December 1953 with five of his close associates.\nThe power struggle continued. Malenkov's power was in the central state apparatus, which he sought to extend through reorganizing the government, giving it additional power at the expense of the Party. He also sought public support by lowering retail prices and the level of bond sales to citizens, which had long been effectively obligatory. Khrushchev, with his power base in the Party, sought to strengthen the Party and his position within it. While, under the Soviet system, the Party was to be preeminent, it had been greatly drained of power by Stalin, who had given much of that power to himself and to the Politburo (later, to the Presidium). Khrushchev saw that with the Presidium in conflict, the Party and its Central Committee might again become powerful. Khrushchev carefully cultivated high Party officials and was able to appoint supporters as local Party bosses, who then took seats on the Central Committee.\nKhrushchev presented himself as a down-to-earth activist prepared to take up any challenge, contrasting with Malenkov who, though sophisticated, came across as colourless. Khrushchev arranged for the Kremlin grounds to be opened to the public, an act with \"great public resonance\". While both Malenkov and Khrushchev sought reforms to agriculture, Khrushchev's proposals were broader and included the Virgin Lands Campaign, under which hundreds of thousands of young volunteers would settle and farm areas of Western Siberia and Northern Kazakhstan. While the scheme was initially successful, it eventually became a tremendous disaster for Soviet agriculture. In addition, Khrushchev possessed incriminating information on Malenkov, taken from Beria's secret files. As Soviet prosecutors investigated the atrocities of Stalin's last years, including the Leningrad case, they came across evidence of Malenkov's involvement. Beginning in February 1954, Khrushchev replaced Malenkov in the seat of honour at Presidium meetings; in June, Malenkov ceased to head the list of Presidium members, which was thereafter organized in alphabetical order. Khrushchev's influence continued to increase, winning the allegiance of local party heads, and with his nominee heading the KGB.\nIn 1954, the Soviet leadership with Khrushchev transferred Crimea from the Russian SFSR to the Ukrainian SSR, a decision often attributed to Khrushchev's origin. Other historians, though, point more to the pacification of inner-soviet tensions and to a move in the power game with Malenkov.\nAt a Central Committee meeting in January 1955, Malenkov was accused of involvement in atrocities, and the committee passed a resolution accusing him of involvement in the Leningrad case, and of facilitating Beria's climb to power. At a meeting of the mostly ceremonial Supreme Soviet the following month, Malenkov was demoted in favor of Bulganin, to the surprise of Western observers. Malenkov remained in the Presidium as Minister of Electric Power Stations. According to Khrushchev biographer William Tompson, \"Khrushchev's position as first among the members of the collective leadership was now beyond any reasonable doubt.\"\nThe post-Stalin battle for political control reshaped foreign policy. There was more realism and less ideological abstraction when confronted by European and Middle Eastern situations. Khrushchev's \"secret speech\" attack on Stalin in 1956 was a signal for abandoning Stalinist precepts and looking at new options, including more involvement in the Middle East. Khrushchev in power did not moderate his personality\u2014he remained unpredictable and was emboldened by the spectacular successes in space. He thought that would give the USSR world prestige, leading to quick Communist advances in the Third World. Khrushchev's policy was still restrained by the need to retain the support of the Presidium and to placate the inarticulate but restive Soviet masses who were thrilled by Sputnik but demanded a higher standard of living on the ground as well.\nLeader of the Soviet Union (1955\u20131964).\nDomestic policies.\nConsolidation of power and \"Secret Speech\".\nAfter the demotion of Malenkov, Khrushchev and Molotov initially worked together well. Molotov even proposed that Khrushchev, not Bulganin, replace Malenkov as premier. However, Khrushchev and Molotov increasingly differed on policy. Molotov opposed the Virgin Lands policy, instead proposing heavy investment to increase yields in developed agricultural areas, which Khrushchev felt was not feasible due to a lack of resources and a lack of a sophisticated farm labor force. The two differed on foreign policy as well; soon after Khrushchev took power, he sought a peace treaty with Austria, which would allow Soviet troops then occupying part of the country to leave. Molotov was resistant, but Khrushchev arranged for an Austrian delegation to come to Moscow and negotiate the treaty. Although Khrushchev and other Presidium members attacked Molotov at a Central Committee meeting in mid-1955, accusing him of conducting a foreign policy which turned the world against the USSR, Molotov remained in his position.\nBy the end of 1955, thousands of political prisoners had returned home and related their experiences of the Gulag labor camps. Accounts from Gulag survivors like Alexei Snegov and Olga Shatunovskaya brought home the full breadth of Stalin's crimes to his successors. Working together with his close ally Anastas Mikoyan, Khrushchev soon became convinced that once the stain of Stalinism was removed, the Party would inspire loyalty among the people. Beginning in October 1955, Khrushchev fought to tell the delegates to the upcoming 20th Party Congress about Stalin's crimes. Some of his colleagues, including Molotov and Malenkov, opposed the disclosure and persuaded him to make his remarks in a closed session.\nThe 20th Party Congress opened on 14 February 1956. In his opening words in his initial address, Khrushchev denigrated Stalin by asking delegates to rise in honour of the Communist leaders who had died since the last congress, whom he named, equating Stalin with Klement Gottwald and the little-known Kyuichi Tokuda. In the early morning of 25 February, Khrushchev delivered what became known as the \"Secret Speech\" to a closed session of the Congress limited to Soviet delegates. In four hours, he demolished Stalin's reputation. Khrushchev noted in his memoirs that the \"congress listened to me in silence. As the saying goes, you could have heard a pin drop. It was all so sudden and unexpected.\" Khrushchev told the delegates:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is here that Stalin showed in a whole series of cases his intolerance, his brutality, and his abuse of power\u00a0... he often chose the path of repression and physical annihilation, not only against actual enemies but also against individuals who had not committed any crimes against the party or the Soviet Government.\nThe Secret Speech did not fundamentally change Soviet society but had wide-ranging effects. The speech was a factor in unrest in Poland and revolution in Hungary later in 1956, and Stalin defenders led four days of rioting in his native Georgia in June, calling for Khrushchev to resign and Molotov to take over. In meetings where the Secret Speech was read, communists would make even more severe condemnations of Stalin (and of Khrushchev), and even call for multi-party elections. However, Stalin was not publicly denounced, and his portrait remained widespread through the USSR, from airports to Khrushchev's Kremlin office. Mikhail Gorbachev, then a Komsomol official, recalled that though young and well-educated Soviets in his district were excited by the speech, many others decried it, either defending Stalin or seeing little point in digging up the past. Forty years later, after the fall of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev applauded Khrushchev for his courage in taking a huge political risk and showing himself to be \"a moral man after all\".\nThe term \"Secret Speech\" proved to be an utter misnomer. While the attendees at the Speech were all Soviet, Eastern European delegates were allowed to hear it the following night, read slowly to allow them to take notes. By 5 March, copies were being mailed throughout the Soviet Union, marked \"not for the press\" rather than \"top secret\". An official translation appeared within a month in Poland; the Poles printed 12,000 extra copies, one of which soon reached the West. Khrushchev's son, Sergei, later wrote: clearly, Father tried to ensure it would reach as many ears as possible. It was soon read at Komsomol meetings; that meant another eighteen million listeners. If you include their relatives, friends, and acquaintances, you could say that the entire country became familiar with the speech\u00a0... Spring had barely begun when the speech began circulating around the world.\nThe anti-Khrushchev minority in the Presidium was augmented by those opposed to Khrushchev's proposals to decentralize authority over industry, which struck at the heart of Malenkov's power base. During the first half of 1957, Malenkov, Molotov, and Kaganovich worked to quietly build support to dismiss Khrushchev. At an 18 June Presidium meeting at which two Khrushchev supporters were absent, the plotters moved that Bulganin, who had joined the scheme, take the chair, and proposed other moves which would effectively demote Khrushchev and put themselves in control. Khrushchev objected on the grounds that not all Presidium members had been notified, an objection which would have been quickly dismissed had Khrushchev not held firm control over the military, through Minister of Defense Marshal Zhukov, and the security departments. Lengthy Presidium meetings took place, continuing over several days. As word leaked of the power struggle, members of the Central Committee, which Khrushchev controlled, streamed to Moscow, many flown there aboard military planes, and demanded to be admitted to the meeting. While they were not admitted, there were soon enough Central Committee members in Moscow to call an emergency Party Congress, which effectively forced the leadership to allow a session of the Central Committee. At that meeting, the three main conspirators were dubbed the Anti-Party Group, and denounced with accusations of factionalism and complicity in Stalin's crimes. The three were expelled from the Central Committee and Presidium, as was former Foreign Minister and Khrushchev client Dmitri Shepilov who joined them in the plot. Molotov was sent as Ambassador to Mongolia; the others were sent to head industrial facilities and institutes far from Moscow.\nMarshal Zhukov was rewarded for his support with full membership in the Presidium, but Khrushchev feared his popularity and power. In October 1957, the defense minister was sent on a tour of the Balkans, as Khrushchev arranged a Presidium meeting to dismiss him. Zhukov learned what was happening, and hurried back to Moscow, only to be formally notified of his dismissal. At a Central Committee meeting several weeks later, not a word was said in Zhukov's defense. Khrushchev completed the consolidation of power in March 1958, arranging for Bulganin's dismissal as premier in favor of himself (Bulganin was appointed to head the \"Gosbank\") and by establishing a USSR Defense Council, led by himself, effectively making him commander in chief. Though Khrushchev was now preeminent, he did not enjoy Stalin's absolute power.\nLiberalization and the arts.\nAfter assuming power, Khrushchev allowed a modest amount of freedom in the arts. Vladimir Dudintsev's novel \"Not by Bread Alone\", about an idealistic engineer opposed by rigid bureaucrats, was allowed to be published in 1956, though Khrushchev called the novel \"false at its base\". In 1958, however, Khrushchev ordered a fierce attack on Boris Pasternak after his novel \"Doctor Zhivago\" was published abroad (he was denied permission to publish it in the Soviet Union). \"Pravda\" described the novel as \"low-grade reactionary hackwork\", and the author was expelled from the Writer's Union. Pasternak was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, but under heavy pressure he declined it. Once he did so, Khrushchev ordered a halt to the attacks on Pasternak. In his memoirs, Khrushchev stated that he agonized over the novel, very nearly allowed it to be published, and later regretted not doing so. After his fall from power, Khrushchev read the novel (he had earlier read only excerpts) and stated, \"We shouldn't have banned it. I should have read it myself. There's nothing anti-Soviet in it.\"\nKhrushchev believed that the USSR could match the West's living standards, and was not afraid to allow Soviet citizens to see Western achievements. Stalin had permitted few tourists to the Soviet Union, and had allowed few Soviets to travel. Khrushchev let Soviets travel (over two million Soviet citizens travelled abroad between 1957 and 1961, 700,000 of whom visited the West) and allowed foreigners to visit the Soviet Union, where tourists became subjects of immense curiosity. In 1957, Khrushchev authorized the 6th World Festival of Youth and Students to be held in Moscow that summer. He instructed Komsomol officials to \"smother foreign guests in our embrace\". The resulting \"socialist carnival\" involved over three million Moscovites, who joined with 30,000 young foreign visitors in events that ranged from discussion groups throughout the city to events at the Kremlin itself. According to historian Vladislav Zubok, the festival \"shattered propagandist clich\u00e9s\" about Westerners by allowing Moscovites to see them for themselves.\nIn 1962, Khrushchev, impressed by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's \"One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich\", persuaded the Presidium to allow publication. That renewed thaw ended on 1 December 1962, when Khrushchev was taken to the Manezh Gallery to view an exhibit which included a number of avant-garde works. On seeing them, Khrushchev exploded with anger, an episode known as the Manege Affair, describing the artwork as \"dog shit\", and proclaiming that \"a donkey could smear better art with its tail\". A week later, \"Pravda\" issued a call for artistic purity. When writers and filmmakers defended the painters, Khrushchev extended his anger to them. However, despite the premier's rage, none of the artists were arrested or exiled. The Manezh Gallery exhibit remained open and experienced a considerable rise in attendance after the article in \"Pravda\".\nPolitical reform.\nUnder Khrushchev, the special tribunals operated by security agencies were abolished. These tribunals, known as \"troikas\", had often ignored laws and procedures. Under the reforms, no prosecution for a political crime could be brought even in the regular courts unless approved by the local Party committee. This rarely happened; there were no major political trials under Khrushchev, and at most several hundred political prosecutions overall. Instead, other sanctions were imposed on Soviet dissidents, including loss of job or university position, or expulsion from the Party. During Khrushchev's rule, forced hospitalization for the \"socially dangerous\" was introduced. According to author Roy Medvedev, who wrote an early analysis of Khrushchev's years in power, \"political terror as an everyday method of government was replaced under Khrushchev by administrative means of repression\".\nIn 1958, Khrushchev opened a Central Committee meeting to hundreds of Soviet officials; some were even allowed to address the meeting. For the first time, the proceedings of the committee were made public in book form, a practice which was continued at subsequent meetings. This openness, however, actually allowed Khrushchev greater control over the committee, since dissenters would have to make their case in front of a large, disapproving crowd.\nIn 1962, Khrushchev divided \"oblast\" level Party committees (\"obkoms\") into two parallel structures, one for industry and one for agriculture. This was unpopular among Party \"apparatchiks\", and led to confusions in the chain of command, as neither committee secretary had precedence over the other. As there were limited numbers of Central Committee seats from each \"oblast\", the division set up the possibility of rivalry for office between factions, and, according to Medvedev, had the potential for beginning a two-party system. Khrushchev also ordered that one-third of the membership of each committee, from low-level councils to the Central Committee itself, be replaced at each election. This decree created tension between Khrushchev and the Central Committee, and upset the party leaders upon whose support Khrushchev had risen to power.\nAgricultural policy.\nKhrushchev was an expert on agricultural policies and sensed an urgent need to reform the backward, inefficient system with ideas that worked in the US. He looked especially at collectivism, state farms, liquidation of machine-tractor stations, planning decentralization, economic incentives, increased labor and capital investment, new crops, and new production programs. Henry Ford had been at the center of American technology transfer to the Soviet Union in the 1930s; he sent over factory designs, engineers, and skilled craftsmen, as well as tens of thousands of Ford tractors. By the 1940s Khrushchev was keenly interested in American agricultural innovations, especially on large-scale family-operated farms in the Midwest. In the 1950s he sent several delegations to visit farms and land grant colleges, looking at successful farms that utilized high-yielding seed varieties, very large and powerful tractors and other machines, all guided by modern management techniques. Especially after his visit to the US in 1959, he was keenly aware of the need to emulate and even match American superiority and agricultural technology.\nKhrushchev became a hyper-enthusiastic crusader to grow corn (maize). He established a corn institute in Ukraine and ordered thousands of hectares to be planted in the Virgin Lands. In 1955, Khrushchev advocated an Iowa-style corn belt in the Soviet Union, and a Soviet delegation visited the U.S. state that summer. The delegation chief was approached by farmer and corn seed salesman Roswell Garst, who persuaded him to visit Garst's large farm. The Iowan visited the Soviet Union, where he became friends with Khrushchev, and Garst sold the USSR of seed corn. Garst warned the Soviets to grow the corn in the southern part of the country and to ensure there were sufficient stocks of fertilizer, insecticides, and herbicides. This, however, was not done, as Khrushchev sought to plant corn even in Siberia, and without the necessary chemicals. The corn experiment was not a great success, and he later complained that overenthusiastic officials had overplanted without laying the proper groundwork, and \"as a result corn was discredited as a silage crop\u2014and so was I\".\nKhrushchev sought to abolish the Machine-Tractor Stations (MTS) which not only owned most large agricultural machines but also provided services such as plowing, and transfer their equipment and functions to the \"kolkhozes\" and \"sovkhozes\" (state farms). After a successful test involving MTS which served one large \"kolkhoz\" each, Khrushchev ordered a gradual transition\u2014but then ordered that the change take place with great speed. Within three months, over half of the MTS facilities had been closed, and \"kolkhozes\" were being required to buy the equipment, with no discount given for older or dilapidated machines. MTS employees, unwilling to bind themselves to \"kolkhozes\" and lose their state employee benefits and the right to change their jobs, fled to the cities, creating a shortage of skilled operators. The costs of the machinery, plus the costs of building storage sheds and fuel tanks for the equipment, impoverished many \"kolkhozes\". Inadequate provisions were made for repair stations. Without the MTS, the market for Soviet agricultural equipment fell apart, as the \"kolkhozes\" now had neither the money nor skilled buyers to purchase new equipment.\nIn the 1940s, Stalin put Trofim Lysenko in charge of agricultural research, with his ideas that flouted modern genetics science. Lysenko maintained his influence under Khrushchev, and helped block the adoption of American techniques. In 1959, Khrushchev announced a goal of overtaking the US in the production of milk, meat, and butter. Local officials kept Khrushchev happy with unrealistic pledges of production. These goals were met by farmers who slaughtered their breeding herds and by purchasing meat at state stores, then reselling it back to the government, artificially increasing recorded production.\nIn June 1962, food prices were raised, particularly on meat and butter, by 25\u201330%. This caused public discontent. In the southern Russian city of Novocherkassk, this discontent escalated to a strike and a revolt against the authorities. The revolt was put down by the military, resulting in a massacre that killed 22 people and wounded 87 according to Soviet official accounts. In addition, 116 demonstrators were convicted of involvement and seven were executed. Information about the revolt was completely suppressed in the USSR, but spread through Samizdat and damaged Khrushchev's reputation in the West.\nDrought struck the Soviet Union in 1963; the harvest of of grain was down from a peak of in 1958. The shortages resulted in bread lines, a fact at first kept from Khrushchev. Reluctant to purchase food in the West, but faced with the alternative of widespread hunger, Khrushchev exhausted the nation's hard currency reserves and expended part of its gold stockpile in the purchase of grain and other foodstuffs.\nEducation.\nWhile visiting the United States in 1959, Khrushchev was impressed by the agricultural education program at Iowa State University, and sought to imitate it in the Soviet Union. At the time, the main agricultural college in the USSR was in Moscow, and students did not do the manual labor of farming. Khrushchev proposed moving the programs to rural areas. He was unsuccessful, due to resistance from professors and students, who never actually disagreed with the premier, but who did not carry out his proposals. Khrushchev recalled in his memoirs: It's nice to live in Moscow and work at the Timiryazev Agricultural Academy. It's a venerable old institution, a large economic unit, with skilled instructors, but it's in the city! Its students aren't yearning to work on the collective farms because to do that they'd have to go out in the provinces and live in the sticks.\nKhrushchev founded several academic towns, such as Akademgorodok. The premier believed that Western science flourished because many scientists lived in university towns such as Oxford, isolated from big-city distractions, and had pleasant living conditions and good pay. He sought to duplicate those conditions. Khrushchev's attempt was generally successful, though his new towns and scientific centres tended to attract younger scientists, with older ones unwilling to leave Moscow or Leningrad.\nKhrushchev also proposed to restructure Soviet high schools. While the high schools provided a college preparatory curriculum, few Soviet youths went on to university. Khrushchev wanted to shift the focus of secondary schools to vocational training. In practice, schools developed links with nearby enterprises and students went to work for only one or two days a week; the organizations disliked having to teach, while students and their families complained that they had little choice in what trade to learn.\nWhile the vocational proposal would not survive Khrushchev's downfall, a longer-lasting change was a related establishment of specialized high schools. These schools were modeled after the foreign-language schools that had been established in Moscow and Leningrad beginning in 1949. In 1962, a special summer school was established in Novosibirsk to prepare students for the Siberian math and science Olympiad. The following year, the Novosibirsk Maths and Science Boarding-School became the first permanent residential school specializing in math and science. Other such schools were soon established in Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev. By the early 1970s, over 100 specialized schools had been established, in mathematics, the sciences, art, music, and sport. Preschool education was increased as part of Khrushchev's reforms, and by the time he left office, about 22% of Soviet children attended preschool\u2014about half of urban children, but only about 12% of rural children.\nAnti-religious campaign.\nThe anti-religious campaign of the Khrushchev era began in 1959, coinciding with the 21st Party Congress. It was carried out by mass closures of churches (reducing the number from 22,000 in 1959 to 13,008 in 1960 and to 7,873 by 1965), monasteries, convents, and seminaries. The campaign also included a restriction on parental rights to teach religion to their children; a ban on the presence of children at church services; and a ban on the administration of the Eucharist to children over the age of four. Khrushchev additionally banned all services held outside of churches' walls, renewed enforcement of 1929 legislation banning pilgrimages, and recorded the personal identities of all adults requesting church baptisms, weddings, or funerals. He disallowed the ringing of church bells and services in daytime in some rural settings from May to the end of October under the pretext of fieldwork requirements. Non-fulfillment of these regulations by clergy would lead to disallowance of state registration (meaning clergy could no longer do any pastoral or liturgical work without special state permission). According to Dimitry Pospielovsky, the state carried out forced retirement, arrests, and prison sentences for clergymen on \"trumped-up charges,\" but in reality, he writes, said state actions were taken against clergy who resisted the closure of churches; delivered sermons attacking the USSR's state atheism and anti-religious campaign; conducted Christian charity; or made religion popular by personal example.\nForeign and defense policies.\nFrom 1950 to 1953 Khrushchev was well-placed to closely observe and evaluate Stalin's foreign policy. Khrushchev considered the entire Cold War to be a serious mistake on Stalin's part. In the long term, it created an unnecessary and expensive militarized struggle with NATO. It diverted attention away from the neutral developing world, where progress could be made, and it weakened Moscow's relationship with its East European satellites. Basically Khrushchev was much more optimistic about the future than Stalin or Molotov, and was more of an internationalist. He believed the working classes and the common peoples of the world would eventually find their way towards socialism and even communism, and that conflicts like the Cold War diverted their attention from this eventual goal. Peaceful coexistence of the sort that Lenin himself had practiced at first would allow the Soviet Union and its satellite states to build up their economies and their standard of living. Khrushchev decided that Stalin had made a series of mistakes, such as heavy-handed pressure in Turkey and Iran in 1945 and 1946, and especially heavy pressure on Berlin that led to the failed Berlin blockade in 1948. Germany was a major issue for Khrushchev, not because he feared a NATO invasion eastward, but because it weakened the East German regime, which economically paled in comparison to the economic progress of West Germany. Khrushchev blamed Molotov for being unable to resolve the conflict with Yugoslavia, and largely ignoring the needs of the East European communist satellites.\nKhrushchev chose Austria as a way to quickly come to agreement with NATO. It became a small neutralized nation economically tied to the West but diplomatically neutral and no threat.\nWhen Khrushchev took control, the outside world still knew little of him, and initially was not impressed by him. Short, heavyset, and wearing ill-fitting suits, he \"radiated energy but not intellect\", and was dismissed by many as a buffoon who would not last long. British Foreign Secretary Harold Macmillan wondered, \"How can this fat, vulgar man with his pig eyes and ceaseless flow of talk be the head\u2014the aspirant Tsar for all those millions of people?\"\nKhrushchev biographer Tompson stated:\nHe could be charming or vulgar, ebullient or sullen, he was given to public displays of rage (often contrived) and to soaring hyperbole in his rhetoric. But whatever he was, however, he came across, he was more human than his predecessor or even than most of his foreign counterparts, and for much of the world that was enough to make the USSR seem less mysterious or menacing.\nUnited States and NATO.\nEarly relations and U.S. visit (1957\u20131960).\nKhrushchev sought to find a lasting solution to the problem of a divided Germany and of the enclave of West Berlin. In November 1958, calling West Berlin a \"malignant tumor\", he gave the United States, United Kingdom and France six months to conclude a peace treaty with both German states and the Soviet Union. If one was not signed, Khrushchev stated, the Soviet Union would conclude a peace treaty with East Germany. This would leave East Germany, which was not a party to treaties giving the Western Powers access to Berlin, in control of the routes to the city. They proposed making Berlin a free city, which meant no outside military forces would be stationed there. West Germany, United States and France strongly opposed the ultimatum, but Britain wanted to consider it as a starting point for negotiations. No one wanted to risk war over the issue. At Britain's request, Khrushchev extended and ultimately dropped the ultimatum, as the Berlin issue became part of the complex agenda of high-level summit meetings.\nKhrushchev sought to sharply reduce levels of conventional weapons and to defend the Soviet Union with missiles. He believed that without this transition, the huge Soviet military would continue to eat up resources, making Khrushchev's goals of improving Soviet life difficult to achieve. He abandoned Stalin's plans for a large navy in 1955, believing that the new ships would be too vulnerable to either a conventional or nuclear attack. In January 1960, he took advantage of improved relations with the U.S. to order a reduction of one-third in the size of Soviet armed forces, alleging that advanced weapons would make up for the lost troops. While conscription of Soviet youth remained in force, exemptions from military service became more and more common, especially for students.\nHistorians Campbell Craig and Sergey Radchenko later argued that Khrushchev thought that policies like Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) were too dangerous for the Soviet Union. His approach did not greatly change his foreign policy or military doctrine but is apparent in his determination to choose options that minimized the risk of war. The Soviets had few operable intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), but Khrushchev publicly boasted of the Soviets' missile programs, stating that Soviet weapons were varied and numerous. The First Secretary hoped that public perception that the Soviets were ahead would put psychological pressure on the West resulting in political concessions. The Soviet space program, which Khrushchev firmly supported, appeared to confirm his claims when the Soviets launched Sputnik 1 into orbit, a feat that astonished the world. Western governments concluded that the Soviet ICBM program was further along than it actually was. Khrushchev added to this misapprehension by stating in an October 1957 interview that the USSR had all the rockets, of whatever capacity, that it needed.\nFor years, Khrushchev would make a point of preceding a major foreign trip with a rocket launch, to the discomfiture of his hosts. In January 1960 Khrushchev told the Presidium that Soviet ICBMs made an agreement with the U.S. possible because \"main-street Americans have begun to shake from fear for the first times in their lives\". The United States had learned of the underdeveloped state of the Soviet missile program from overflights in the late 1950s, but only high U.S. officials knew of the deception. The perception of a \"missile gap\" led to a considerable defense buildup on the part of the United States.\nDuring Vice President Nixon's visit to the Soviet Union in 1959 he and Khrushchev took part in what later became known as the Kitchen Debate. Nixon and Khrushchev had an impassioned argument in a model kitchen at the American National Exhibition in Moscow, with each defending the economic system of his country.\nNixon invited Khrushchev to visit the United States, and he agreed. He made his first visit to the United States, arriving in Washington, on 15 September 1959, spending thirteen days in the country. This first visit by a Soviet premier resulted in an extended media circus. Khrushchev brought his wife and adult children with him, though it was not usual for Soviet officials to travel with their families. He visited New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco (visiting a supermarket), Coon Rapids, Iowa (visiting Roswell Garst's farm), Pittsburgh, and Washington, concluding with a meeting with President Eisenhower at Camp David. During luncheon at the Twentieth Century-Fox Studio in Los Angeles Khrushchev engaged in an improvised yet jovial debate with his host Spyros Skouras over the merits of capitalism and communism. Khrushchev was also to visit Disneyland, but the visit was canceled for security reasons, much to his disgruntlement. He did, however, visit Eleanor Roosevelt at her home. While visiting IBM's new research campus in San Jose, California, Khrushchev expressed little interest in computer technology, but he greatly admired the self-service cafeteria, and, on his return, introduced self-service in the Soviet Union.\nThis visit resulted in an informal agreement that there would be no firm deadline over Berlin, but that there would be a four-power summit to try to resolve the issue. The Russian's goal was to present warmth, charm and peacefulness, using candid interviews to convince Americans of his humanity and good will. He performed well and Theodore Windt calls it \"the zenith of his career.\" The friendly American audiences convinced Khrushchev that he had achieved a strong personal relationship with Eisenhower and that he could achieve d\u00e9tente with the Americans. Eisenhower was actually unimpressed by the Soviet leader. He pushed for an immediate summit but was frustrated by French President Charles de Gaulle, who postponed it until 1960, a year in which Eisenhower was scheduled to pay a return visit to the Soviet Union.\nU-2 and Berlin crisis (1960\u20131961).\nA constant irritant in Soviet\u2013U.S. relations was the overflight of the Soviet Union by American U-2 spy aircraft. On 9 April 1960, the U.S. resumed such flights after a lengthy break. The Soviets had protested the flights in the past but had been ignored by Washington. Content in what he thought was a strong personal relationship with Eisenhower, Khrushchev was confused and angered by the flights' resumption, and concluded that they had been ordered by CIA Director Allen Dulles without Eisenhower's knowledge. Khrushchev planned to visit the U.S. to meet Eisenhower, but the visit was canceled when Soviet Air Defence Forces brought down the U.S. U-2. On 1 May, a U-2 was shot down, its pilot, Francis Gary Powers, captured alive. Believing Powers to have been killed, the U.S. announced that a weather plane had been lost near the Turkish-Soviet border. Khrushchev risked destroying the summit, due to start on 16 May in Paris, if he announced the shootdown, but would look weak in the eyes of his military and security forces if he did nothing. On 5 May, Khrushchev announced the shootdown and Powers' capture, blaming the overflight on \"imperialist circles and militarists, whose stronghold is the Pentagon\", and suggesting the plane had been sent without Eisenhower's knowledge. Eisenhower could not have it thought that there were rogue elements in the Pentagon operating without his knowledge, and admitted that he had ordered the flights, calling them \"a distasteful necessity\". The admission stunned Khrushchev and turned the U-2 affair from a possible triumph to a disaster for him, and he even appealed to U.S. Ambassador Llewellyn Thompson for help.\nKhrushchev was undecided what to do at the summit even as he boarded his flight. He finally decided, in consultation with his advisers on the plane and Presidium members in Moscow, to demand an apology from Eisenhower and a promise that there would be no further U-2 flights in Soviet airspace. Neither Eisenhower nor Khrushchev communicated with the other in the days before the summit, and at the summit, Khrushchev made his demands and stated that there was no purpose in the summit, which should be postponed for six to eight months, until after the 1960 United States presidential election. The U.S. president offered no apology but stated that the flights had been suspended and would not resume and renewed his Open Skies proposal for mutual overflight rights. This was not enough for Khrushchev, who left the summit. Eisenhower accused Khrushchev \"of sabotaging this meeting, on which so much of the hopes of the world have rested\". Eisenhower's visit to the Soviet Union, for which the premier had even built a golf course so the U.S. president could enjoy his favorite sport, was cancelled by Khrushchev.\nKhrushchev made his second and final visit to the US in September 1960. He had no invitation but had appointed himself as head of the USSR's UN delegation. He spent much of his time wooing the new Third World states which had recently become independent. The U.S. restricted him to the island of Manhattan, with visits to an estate owned by the USSR on Long Island. The notorious shoe-banging incident occurred during a debate on 12 October over a Soviet resolution decrying colonialism. Khrushchev was infuriated by a statement of the Filipino delegate Lorenzo Sumulong charging the Soviets with employing a double standard by decrying colonialism while dominating Eastern Europe. Khrushchev demanded the right to reply immediately and accused Sumulong of being \"a fawning lackey of the American imperialists\". Sumulong accused the Soviets of hypocrisy. Khrushchev yanked off his shoe and began banging it on his desk. This behavior by Khrushchev scandalized his delegation.\nKhrushchev considered U.S. Vice President Nixon a hardliner and was delighted by his defeat in the 1960 presidential election. He considered the victor, John F. Kennedy, as a far more likely partner for d\u00e9tente, but was taken aback by the newly inaugurated U.S. President's tough talk and actions in the early days of his administration. Khrushchev achieved a propaganda victory in April 1961 with the first human spaceflight, while Kennedy suffered a defeat with the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion. While Khrushchev had threatened to defend Cuba with Soviet missiles, the premier contented himself with after-the-fact aggressive remarks. The failure in Cuba led to Kennedy's determination to make no concessions at the Vienna summit scheduled for 3 June 1961. Both Kennedy and Khrushchev took a hard line, with Khrushchev demanding a treaty that would recognize the two German states and refusing to yield on the remaining issues obstructing a test-ban treaty. Kennedy, in contrast, had been led to believe that the test-ban treaty could be concluded at the summit, and felt that a deal on Berlin had to await easing of east\u2013west tensions.\nAn indefinite postponement of action over Berlin was unacceptable to Khrushchev if for no other reason than that East Germany was suffering a continuous brain drain as highly educated East Germans fled west through Berlin. While the boundary between the two German states had elsewhere been fortified, Berlin, administered by the four Allied powers, remained open. Emboldened by statements from former U.S. Ambassador to Moscow Charles E. Bohlen and United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations Chairman J. William Fulbright that East Germany had every right to close its borders, Khrushchev authorized East German leader Walter Ulbricht to begin construction of what became known as the Berlin Wall. Construction preparations were made in great secrecy, and the border was sealed off in the early hours of Sunday, 13 August 1961, when most East German workers who earned hard currency by working in West Berlin would be at their homes. The wall was a propaganda disaster and marked the end of Khrushchev's attempts to conclude a peace treaty among the Four Powers and the two German states. That treaty would not be signed until September 1990, as an immediate prelude to German reunification.\nCuban Missile Crisis and the test ban treaty (1962\u20131964).\nSuperpower tensions culminated in the Cuban Missile Crisis (in the USSR, the \"Caribbean crisis\") of October 1962, as the Soviet Union sought to install medium-range nuclear missiles in Cuba, about from the U.S. coast. Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro was reluctant to accept the missiles, and, once he was persuaded, warned Khrushchev against transporting the missiles in secret. Castro stated, thirty years later, \"We had a sovereign right to accept the missiles. We were not violating international law. Why do it secretly\u2014as if we had no right to do it? I warned Nikita that secrecy would give the imperialists the advantage.\"\nOn 16 October, Kennedy was informed that U-2 flights over Cuba had discovered what were most likely medium-range missile sites, and though he and his advisors considered approaching Khrushchev through diplomatic channels, they could come up with no way of doing this that would not appear weak. On 22 October, Kennedy addressed his nation by television, revealing the missiles' presence and announcing a blockade of Cuba. Informed in advance of the speech but not (until one hour before) the content, Khrushchev and his advisors feared an invasion of Cuba. Even before Kennedy's speech, they ordered Soviet commanders in Cuba that they could use all weapons against an attack\u2014except atomic weapons.\nAs the crisis unfolded, tensions were high in the U.S.; less so in the Soviet Union, where Khrushchev made several public appearances and went to the Bolshoi Theatre to hear American opera singer Jerome Hines. By 25 October, with the Soviets unclear about Kennedy's full intentions, Khrushchev decided that the missiles would have to be withdrawn from Cuba. Khrushchev agreed to withdraw the missiles in exchange for a U.S. promise not to invade Cuba and a secret promise that the U.S. would withdraw missiles from Turkey. As the last term was not publicly announced at the request of the U.S., and was not known until just before Khrushchev's death in 1971, the resolution was seen as a great defeat for the Soviets and contributed to Khrushchev's fall less than two years later. Castro had urged Khrushchev to launch a preemptive nuclear attack on the U.S. in the event of an invasion of Cuba, and was angered by the outcome, referring to Khrushchev in profane terms.\nAfter the crisis, superpower relations improved, as Kennedy gave a conciliatory speech on 10 June 1963, recognizing the Soviet people's suffering during World War II, and paying tribute to their achievements. Khrushchev called the speech the best by a U.S. president since Franklin D. Roosevelt, and, in July, negotiated a test ban treaty with U.S. negotiator Averell Harriman and Lord Hailsham of the United Kingdom. Plans for a second Khrushchev-Kennedy summit were dashed by Kennedy's assassination in November 1963. The new U.S. president, Lyndon Johnson, hoped for continued improved relations but was distracted by other issues and had little opportunity to develop a relationship with Khrushchev before the premier was ousted.\nEastern Europe.\nThe Secret Speech, combined with the death of the Polish communist leader Boles\u0142aw Bierut, who suffered a heart attack while reading the Speech, sparked considerable liberalization in Poland and Hungary. In Poland, a worker's strike in Pozna\u0144 developed into disturbances that left more than 50 dead in June 1956. When Moscow blamed the disturbances on Western agitators, Polish leaders ignored the claim and made concessions to the workers. With anti-Soviet displays becoming more common in Poland, and crucial Polish leadership elections upcoming, Khrushchev and other Presidium members flew to Warsaw on 19 October to meet with the Polish Presidium. The Soviets agreed to allow the new Polish leadership to take office, on the assurance there would be no change to the Soviet-Polish relationship. A period of at least partial liberalization, known as the Polish October, followed.\nThe Polish settlement emboldened the Hungarians. A mass demonstration in Budapest on 23 October turned into a popular uprising. In response, Hungarian Party leaders installed reformist Premier Imre Nagy. Soviet forces in the city clashed with Hungarians and fired on demonstrators, with hundreds of both Hungarians and Soviets killed. Nagy called for a cease-fire and a withdrawal of Soviet troops, which a Khrushchev-led majority in the Presidium decided to obey, choosing to give the new Hungarian government a chance. Khrushchev assumed that if Moscow announced liberalization in how it dealt with its allies, Nagy would adhere to the alliance with the Soviet Union.\nOn 30 October Nagy announced multiparty elections, and the next morning that Hungary would leave the Warsaw Pact. On 3 November, two members of the Nagy government appeared in Ukraine as the self-proclaimed heads of a provisional government and demanded Soviet intervention, which was forthcoming. The next day, Soviet troops crushed the Hungarian uprising, with a death toll of 4,000 Hungarians and several hundred Soviet troops. Nagy was arrested and later executed. Despite the international outrage over the intervention, Khrushchev defended his actions for the rest of his life. Damage to Soviet foreign relations was severe and would have been greater were it not for the timing of the Suez crisis, which distracted world attention.\nIn the aftermath of these crises, Khrushchev made the statement for which he became well-remembered, \"We will bury you\". While many in the West took this statement as a threat, Khrushchev made the statement in a speech on peaceful coexistence with the West. When questioned about the statement during his 1959 U.S. visit, Khrushchev stated that he was not referring to a literal burial, but that, through inexorable historical development, communism would replace capitalism.\nKhrushchev greatly improved relations with Yugoslavia, which had been entirely sundered in 1948 when Stalin realized he could not control Yugoslav leader Josip Tito. Khrushchev led a Soviet delegation to Belgrade in 1955. Though a hostile Tito did everything he could to make the Soviets look foolish , Khrushchev was successful in warming relations, ending the Informbiro period. During the Hungarian crisis, Tito initially supported Nagy, but Khrushchev persuaded him of the need for intervention. Still, the intervention in Hungary damaged Moscow's relationship with Belgrade, which Khrushchev spent several years trying to repair. He was hampered by the fact that China disapproved of Yugoslavia's reformist socialism and attempts to conciliate Belgrade resulted in an angry Beijing.\nChina.\nAfter completing his takeover of mainland China in 1949, Mao Zedong sought material assistance from the USSR, and also called for the return to China of territories taken from it under the Tsars. Khrushchev increased aid to China, even sending a small corps of experts to help develop the new communist country. This assistance was described by historian William C. Kirby as \"the greatest transfer of technology in world history\". The Soviet Union spent 7% of its national income between 1954 and 1959 on aid to China. On his 1954 visit to China, Khrushchev agreed to return Port Arthur and Dalian to China, though Khrushchev was annoyed by Mao's insistence that the Soviets leave their artillery.\nMao bitterly opposed Khrushchev's attempts to reach a \"rapprochement\" with more liberal Eastern European states such as Yugoslavia. Khrushchev's government was reluctant to endorse Mao's desires for an assertive worldwide revolutionary movement, preferring to conquer capitalism through raising the standard of living in communist-bloc countries.\nRelations between the two nations began to cool in 1956, with Mao angered both by the Secret Speech and by the fact that the Chinese had not been consulted in advance about it. Mao believed that de-Stalinization was a mistake and a possible threat to his own authority. When Khrushchev visited Beijing in 1958, Mao refused proposals for military cooperation. Hoping to torpedo Khrushchev's efforts at d\u00e9tente with the U.S., Mao soon thereafter provoked the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis, describing the Taiwanese islands as \"batons that keep Eisenhower and Khrushchev dancing, scurrying this way and that.\"\nThe Soviets had planned to provide China with an atomic bomb and full documentation, but in 1959, amid cooler relations, the Soviets destroyed the device and papers instead. When Khrushchev visited China in September, shortly after his successful U.S. visit, he met a chilly reception, and left the country on the third day of a planned seven-day visit. Relations continued to deteriorate in 1960, as both the USSR and China used a Romanian Communist Party congress as an opportunity to attack the other. Khrushchev responded by pulling Soviet experts out of China.\nWest Africa.\nUnder Khrushchev, the Soviet Union provided considerable aid to the newly independent Ghana and Guinea. These were seen as ideal places to test the \"socialist model of development\" because of their critical dependence on economic cooperation with the Soviet Union, in contrast to larger Third World nations like Egypt and Indonesia. This project proved to be a resounding failure, although the lessons learned would have an important influence on Soviet foreign policy towards Africa in the following decades. The Soviet Union's display of ineptitude during the Congo Crisis, where it failed to prevent both the newly independent Republic of the Congo from descending into chaos and the substantial military intervention by Western powers, led to a further cooling of relations between the Soviet Union and its Ghanaian and Guinean partners.\nRemoval.\nBeginning in March 1964, Supreme Soviet presidium chairman and thus nominal head of state Leonid Brezhnev began plotting Khrushchev's removal with his colleagues. While Brezhnev considered having Khrushchev arrested as he returned from a trip to Scandinavia in June, he instead persuaded members of the Central Committee to support the ousting of Khrushchev, remembering how crucial the committee's support had been to Khrushchev in defeating the Anti-Party Group plot. Brezhnev had ample time for his conspiracy, as Khrushchev was absent from Moscow for a total of five months between January and September 1964.\nThe conspirators, led by Brezhnev, First Deputy Premier Alexander Shelepin, and KGB chairman Vladimir Semichastny, struck in October 1964, while Khrushchev was on vacation at Pitsunda with his friend and Presidium colleague Anastas Mikoyan. On 12 October, Brezhnev called Khrushchev to notify him of a special Presidium meeting to be held the following day, ostensibly about agriculture. Even though Khrushchev suspected the real reason for the meeting, he flew to Moscow, accompanied by the head of the Georgian KGB, General Aleksi Inauri, but otherwise taking no precautions.\nKhrushchev arrived at the VIP hall of Vnukovo Airport; KGB chairman Semichastny waited for him there, flanked by KGB guards. Semichastny informed Khrushchev of his ouster and told him not to resist. The plotters' coup went off smoothly; Khrushchev felt betrayed by Semichastny, as he considered him a friend, not suspecting that he had joined his enemies within the Party. Khrushchev was then taken to the Kremlin, to be verbally attacked by Brezhnev, Suslov and Shelepin. He put up little resistance. Semichastny was careful not to create the appearance of a coup:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I didn't even close the Kremlin to visitors. People were strolling around outside, while in the room the Presidium was meeting. I deployed my men around the Kremlin. Everything that was necessary was done. Brezhnev and Shelepin were nervous. I told them: Let's not do anything that isn't necessary. Let's not create the appearance of a coup.\nThat night, after his ouster, Khrushchev called Mikoyan:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I'm old and tired. Let them cope by themselves. I've done the main thing. Could anyone have dreamed of telling Stalin that he didn't suit us anymore and suggesting he retire? Not even a wet spot would have remained where we had been standing. Now everything is different. The fear is gone, and we can talk as equals. That's my contribution. I won't put up a fight.\nOn 14 October 1964, the Presidium and the Central Committee voted to accept Khrushchev's \"voluntary\" request to retire for reasons of \"advanced age and ill health.\" Brezhnev was elected First Secretary, while Alexei Kosygin succeeded Khrushchev as premier.\nLife in retirement.\nKhrushchev was granted a pension of 500 rubles per month and was given a house, a dacha and a car. Following his removal, he fell into deep depression. He received few visitors, especially since his security guards reported all visits. His pension was reduced to 400 rubles per month, though his retirement remained comfortable by Soviet standards. One of his grandsons was asked what the ex-premier was doing in retirement, and the boy replied, \"Grandfather cries.\" Khrushchev was made a non-person to such an extent that the thirty-volume \"Great Soviet Encyclopedia\" omitted him from the list of prominent political commissars during the Great Patriotic War.\nAs the new rulers made known their conservatism in artistic matters, Khrushchev came to be more favorably viewed by artists and writers, some of whom visited him. One visitor whom Khrushchev regretted not seeing was former U.S. Vice President Nixon, who went to Khrushchev's Moscow apartment while the former premier was at his dacha.\nKhrushchev began his memoirs in 1966. He initially tried to dictate them into a tape recorder while outdoors, in an attempt to avoid eavesdropping by the KGB. These attempts failed due to background noise, so he switched to recording indoors. The KGB made no attempt to interfere until 1968, when Khrushchev was ordered to hand over his tapes; he refused. While Khrushchev was hospitalized with heart ailments, his son Sergei was approached by the KGB in July 1970 and told that there was a plot afoot by foreign agents to steal the memoirs. Sergei Khrushchev handed over the materials to the KGB since the KGB could steal the originals anyway, but copies had been made, some of which had been transmitted to a Western publisher. Sergei instructed that the smuggled memoirs should be published, which they were in 1970 under the title \"Khrushchev Remembers\". Under some pressure, Nikita Khrushchev signed a statement that he had not given the materials to any publisher, and his son was transferred to a less desirable job. Upon publication of the memoirs in the West, \"Izvestia\" denounced them as a fraud. Soviet state radio carried the announcement of Khrushchev's statement; it was the first time in six years that he had been mentioned in that medium.\nDeath.\nKhrushchev died of a heart attack around noon in the Moscow Central Clinical Hospital on 11 September 1971, at the age of 77. He was denied a state funeral with interment in the Kremlin Wall and was instead buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow. Fearing demonstrations, the authorities did not announce Khrushchev's death until the hour of his wake, held in a morgue in the southern suburbs of Moscow, and surrounded the cemetery with troops. Even so, some artists and writers joined the family for the internment.\n\"Pravda\" ran a one-sentence announcement of the former premier's death; Western newspapers contained considerable coverage. \"New York Times\" Moscow correspondent Harry Schwartz wrote of Khrushchev, \"Mr. Khrushchev opened the doors and windows of a petrified structure. He let in fresh air and fresh ideas, producing changes which time already has shown are irreversible and fundamental.\"\nLegacy.\nMany of Khrushchev's innovations were reversed after his fall. The requirement that one-third of officials be replaced at each election was overturned, as was the division in the Party structure between industrial and agricultural sectors. His vocational education program for high school students was dropped, and his plan for sending existing agricultural institutions out to the land was ended. However, new agricultural or vocational institutions thereafter were located outside major cities. When new housing was built, much of it was in the form of high rises rather than Khrushchev's low-rise structures.\nHistorian Robert Service summarizes Khrushchev's contradictory personality traits:\n[he was] at once a Stalinist and an anti-Stalinist, a communist believer and a cynic, a self-publicizing poltroon and a crusty philanthropist, a trouble-maker and a peacemaker, a stimulating colleague and a domineering boor, a statesman and a politicker who was out of his intellectual depth.\nSome of Khrushchev's agricultural projects were easily overturned. Corn became so unpopular in 1965 that its planting fell to the lowest level in the postwar period. Lysenko was stripped of his policy-making positions. However, the MTS stations remained closed, and the basic agricultural problems, which Khrushchev had tried to address, remained. While the Soviet standard of living increased greatly in the ten years after Khrushchev's fall, much of the increase was due to industrial progress; agriculture continued to lag far behind, resulting in regular agricultural crises, especially in 1972 and 1975. Brezhnev and his successors continued Khrushchev's precedent of buying grain from the West rather than suffer shortfalls and starvation. Neither Brezhnev nor his colleagues were personally popular, and the new government relied on authoritarian power. The government's conservative tendencies would lead to the crushing of the \"Prague Spring\" of 1968.\nThough Khrushchev's strategy failed to achieve the major goals he sought, Aleksandr Fursenko, who wrote a book analyzing Khrushchev's foreign and military policies, argued that the strategy did coerce the West in a limited manner. The agreement that the US would not invade Cuba has been adhered to. The refusal of the western world to acknowledge East Germany was gradually eroded, and, in 1975, the US and other NATO members signed the Helsinki Agreement with the USSR and Warsaw Pact nations.\nThe Russian public's view of Khrushchev remains mixed. According to a major Russian pollster, the only eras of the 20th century that Russians in the 21st century evaluate positively are those under Nicholas II and under Khrushchev. A poll in 1998 of young Russians found that they felt Nicholas II had done more good than harm, and all other 20th-century Russian leaders more harm than good\u2014except Khrushchev, about whom they were evenly divided. Khrushchev biographer William Tompson related the former premier's reforms to those which occurred later:\nThroughout the Brezhnev years and the lengthy interregnum that followed, the generation which had come of age during the \"first Russian spring\" of the 1950s awaited its turn in power. As Brezhnev and his colleagues died or were pensioned off, they were replaced by men and women for whom the Secret Speech and the first wave of de-Stalinization had been a formative experience, and these \"Children of Twentieth Congress\" took up the reins of power under the leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev and his colleagues. The Khrushchev era provided this second generation of reformers with both an inspiration and a cautionary tale.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPrint.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}
{"id": "42559", "revid": "43901784", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42559", "title": "Kama Sutra", "text": "Ancient Hindu text on erotic love\nThe Kama Sutra (; , , ; lit.\u2009'Principles of Love') is an ancient Indian Hindu Sanskrit text on sexuality, eroticism and emotional fulfillment. Attributed to V\u0101tsy\u0101yana, the \"Kamasutra\" is neither exclusively nor predominantly a sex manual on sex positions, but rather a guide on the art of living well, the nature of love, finding partners, maintaining sex life, and other aspects pertaining to pleasure-oriented faculties. It is a \"sutra\"-genre text with terse aphoristic verses that have survived into the modern era with different s (commentaries). The text is a mix of prose and anustubh-meter poetry verses.\n\"Kamasutra\" acknowledges the Hindu concept of purusharthas, and lists desire, sexuality, and emotional fulfillment as one of the proper goals of life. It discussed methods for courtship, training in the arts to be socially engaging, finding a partner, flirting, maintaining power in a married life, when and how to commit adultery, sexual positions, and other topics. The text majorly dealt with the philosophy and theory of love, what triggers desire, what sustains it, and how and when it is good or bad.\nThe text is one of many Indian texts on \"Kama Shastra\". It is a much-translated work in Indian and non-Indian languages, and has influenced many secondary texts that followed since the 4th-century CE, as well as the Indian arts as exemplified by the pervasive presence of Kama-related reliefs and sculpture in old Hindu temples. Of these, the Khajuraho in Madhya Pradesh is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Among the surviving temples, one in Rajasthan has all the major chapters and sexual positions sculpted to illustrate the \"Kamasutra\".\nAccording to Wendy Doniger, the \"Kamasutra\" became \"one of the most pirated books in English language\" soon after it was published in 1883 by Richard Burton. This first European edition by Burton does not faithfully reflect much in the \"Kamasutra\" because he revised the collaborative translation by Bhagavanlal Indrajit and Shivaram Parashuram Bhide with Forster Arbuthnot to suit 19th-century Victorian tastes.\nDate and authorship.\nThe original composition date or century for the \"Kamasutra\" is unknown. Historians have variously placed it between 400 BCE and 300 CE. According to John Keay, the \"Kama Sutra\" is a compendium that was collected into its present form in the 2nd century CE. In contrast, the Indologist Wendy Doniger, who had co-translated the \"Kama Sutra\" and published many papers on related Hindu texts, stated that the surviving version of the \"Kama Sutra\" must have been revised or composed after 225 CE because it mentions the Abhiras and the Andhras, dynasties that did not co-rule major regions of ancient India before that year. The text makes no mention of the Gupta Empire, which ruled over major urban areas of ancient India, reshaping arts, culture, and economy from the 4th century through the 6th century CE. For these reasons, she dates the \"Kama Sutra\" to the second half of the 3rd century CE. Doniger notes Kama Sutra was composed \"sometime in the third century of the common era, most likely in its second half, at the dawn of the Gupta Empire\".\nThe place of its composition is also unclear. The likely candidates are urban centers of north India, alternatively in the eastern urban Pataliputra (now Patna). Vatsyayana Mallanaga is its widely accepted author because his name is embedded in the colophon verse, but little is known about him. Vatsyayana states that he wrote the text after much meditation. In the preface, Vatsyayana acknowledges that he is distilling many ancient texts, but these have not survived. He cites the work of others he calls \"teachers\" and \"scholars\", and the longer texts by Auddalaki, Babhravya, Dattaka, Suvarnanabha, Ghotakamukha, Gonardiya, Gonikaputra, Charayana, and Kuchumara.\nKamasutra was considered to have been put together from a 150 chapter manuscript that had itself been distilled from 300 chapters which in turn came from a compilation of some 100,000 chapters of text. It was thought to have been written in its final form sometime between the third and fifth century CE.\nVatsyayana's Kamasutra is mentioned and some verses quoted in the \"Brihatsamhita\" of Varahamihira, as well as the poems of Kalidasa. This suggests he lived before the 5th-century CE.\nBackground.\nPurusharthas.\nThe Hindu tradition has the concept of the \"Purusharthas\" which outlines \"four main goals of life\". It holds that every human being has four proper goals that are necessary and sufficient for a fulfilling and happy life:\nEach of these pursuits became a subject of study and led to prolific Sanskrit and some Prakrit languages literature in ancient India. Along with Dharmasastras, Arthasastras and Mokshasastras, the Kamasastras genre have been preserved in palm leaf manuscripts. The \"Kamasutra\" belongs to the Kamasastra genre of texts. Other examples of Hindu Sanskrit texts on sexuality and emotions include the \"Ratirahasya\" (called \"Kokashastra\" in some Indian scripts), the \"Anangaranga\", the \"Nagarasarvasva\", the \"Kandarpachudmani\", and the \"Panchasayaka\".\nThe defining object of the Indian Kamasastra literature, according to Laura Desmond \u2013 an anthropologist and a professor of Religious Studies, is the \"harmonious sensory experience\" from a good relationship between \"the self and the world\", by discovering and enhancing sensory capabilities to \"affect and be affected by the world\". Vatsyayana predominantly discusses Kama along with its relationship with Dharma and Artha. He makes a passing mention of Moksha in some verses.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The earthly vision of our sages leaves nothing indifferent. It is their compassion that sees perfection in everything, that is why the sages created the Kama Shastra. Such a possibility is difficult to find in the ancient world outside India. Especially in the Semitic world, it is unimaginable. If any knowledge is recognized by the Rishi Darshan, it becomes universal to that extent; it also becomes universal. How can there be Shastrasiddhi without Brahmacharya? That is why Vatsayana Maharshi, who created the Kama Shastra, is a Brahmachari; Sri Krishna, who gave us the Moksha Shastra, is also a Brahmachari; all of them are Brahmacharis, eat and fast.\nIt is inappropriate to limit Kama Shastra to erotics or sexology. Kama is an untranslatable concept because it aims at the pleasure of the five senses of action as well as the pleasure of the five senses of knowledge and thereby the pleasure of the inner mind. Like Dharma-Rasas-Brahma, Kama also has an untranslatable meaning.\nThe vision of Maharishi Vatsyayana is indispensable and beneficial for world culture.\u2014\u200a\nVatsyayana's Kamasutra pays tribute not only to kama but also to all three components of the trivarga. The trivarga are dharma, artha, and kama. According to Vatsyayana, all three components of the trivarga are \u015b\u0101stra, that is, worthy of being learned and learned, and prak\u1e5bti. The Kamasutra emphasizes that all three components of the trivarga are interrelated. No one component of the trivarga should be complementary to the other two components, nor should any component be detrimental to the other.\nVedic heritage.\nThe earliest foundations of the \"kamasutra\" are found in the Vedic era literature of Hinduism. Vatsyayana acknowledges this heritage in verse 1.1.9 of the text where he names Svetaketu Uddalaka as the \"first human author of the \"kamasutra\"\". Uddalaka is an early Upanishadic rishi (scholar-poet, sage), whose ideas are found in the \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" such as in section 6.2, and the \"Chandogya Upanishad\" such as over the verses 5.3 through 5.10. These Hindu scriptures are variously dated between 900 BCE and 700 BCE, according to the Indologist and Sanskrit scholar Patrick Olivelle. Among with other ideas such as Atman (self, soul) and the ontological concept of Brahman, these early Upanishads discuss human life, activities and the nature of existence as a form of internalized worship, where sexuality and sex is mapped into a form of religious \"yajna\" ritual (sacrificial fire, Agni) and suffused in spiritual terms:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\nAccording to the Indologist De, a view with which Doniger agrees, this is one of the many evidences that the \"kamasutra\" began in the religious literature of the Vedic era, ideas that were ultimately refined and distilled into a \"sutra\"-genre text by Vatsyayana. According to Doniger, this paradigm of celebrating pleasures, enjoyment and sexuality as a \"dharmic\" act began in the \"earthy, vibrant text known as the \"Rigveda\"\" of the Hindus. The \"Kamasutra\" and celebration of sex, eroticism and pleasure is an integral part of the religious milieu in Hinduism and quite prevalent in its temples.\nEpics.\nHuman relationships, sex and emotional fulfillment are a significant part of the post-Vedic Sanskrit literature such as the major Hindu epics: the \"Mahabharata\" and the \"Ramayana\". The ancient Indian view has been, states Johann Meyer, that love and sex are a delightful necessity. Though she is reserved and selective, \"a woman stands in very great need of \"surata\" (amorous or sexual pleasure)\", and \"the woman has a far stronger erotic disposition, her delight in the sexual act is greater than a man's\".\nManuscripts.\nThe \"Kamasutra\" manuscripts have survived in many versions across the Indian subcontinent. While attempting to get a translation of the Sanskrit kama-sastra text \"Ananga Ranga\", which had already been widely translated by the Hindus in their regional languages such as Marathi, associates of the British Orientalist Richard Burton, stumbled into portions of the \"Kamasutra\" manuscript. Burton then commissioned the Sanskrit scholar Bhagvanlal Indraji to locate a complete \"Kamasutra\" manuscript and translate it. Indraji collected variant manuscripts of the text in libraries and temples of Varanasi, Kolkata and Jaipur. Burton later published an edited English translation of these manuscripts, but not a critical edition of the \"Kamasutra\" in Sanskrit.\nAccording to S.C. Upadhyaya, known for his 1961 scholarly study and a more accurate translation of the \"Kamasutra\", there are issues with the manuscripts that have survived and the text likely underwent revisions over time. This is confirmed by other 1st-millennium CE Hindu texts on \"kama\" that mention and cite the \"Kamasutra\", but some of these quotations credited to the \"Kamasutra\" by these historic authors \"are not to be found in the text of the Kamasutra\" that have survived.\nStructure.\nVatsyayana's \"Kamasutra\" states it has 1,250 verses distributed over 36 chapters in 64 sections organised into 7 books. This statement is included in the opening chapter, a common practice in ancient Hindu texts, likely to prevent major and unauthorized expansions of a popular text. The text that has survived into the modern era has 67 sections, and this list is enumerated in Book 7 and in Yashodhara's Sanskrit commentary (\"bhasya\") on the text.\nThe \"Kamasutra\" uses a mixture of prose and poetry, and the narration has the form of a dramatic fiction where two characters called \"nayaka\" (man) and \"nayika\" (woman), are aided by the characters called \"pitamarda\" (libertine), \"vita\" (pander) and \"vidushaka\" (jester). This format follows the teachings found in the Sanskrit classic \"Natyasastra\". The teachings and discussions found in the \"Kamasutra\" extensively incorporate ancient Hindu mythology and legends.\nContents.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOn balance in life\n&lt;poem&gt;\nIn any period of life in which\none of the elements of the trivarga\n\u2013 dharma, artha, kama \u2013 \nis the primary one, the other two\nshould be natural adjuncts of it.\nUnder no circumstances, should any one of the\ntrivarga be detrimental to the other two.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\n \u2014\"Kamasutra 1.2.1\",&lt;br&gt;Translator: Ludo Rocher\nThe \"Kamasutra\" is a \"sutra\"-genre text consisting of intensely condensed, aphoristic verses. Doniger describes them as a \"kind of atomic string (thread) of meanings\", which are so cryptic that any translation is more like deciphering and filling in the text. Condensing a text into a sutra-genre religious text form makes it easier to remember and transmit, but it also introduces ambiguity and the need to understand the context of each chapter, its philological roots, as well as the prior literature, states Doniger. However, this method of knowledge preservation and transmission has its foundation in the Vedas, which themselves are cryptic and require a commentator and teacher-guide to comprehend the details and the inter-relationship of the ideas. The \"Kamasutra\" too has attracted commentaries, of which the most well known are those of 12th-century or 13th-century Ya\u015bodhara's \"Jayama\u1e45gal\u0101\" in the Sanskrit language, and of Devadatta Shastri who commented on the original text as well as its commentaries in the Hindi language. There are many other Sanskrit commentaries on the \"Kamasutra\", such as the \"Sutra Vritti\" by Narsingha Sastri. These commentaries cite and quote Hindu texts such as the \"Upanishads\", the \"Arthashastra\", the \"Natyashastra\", the \"Manusmriti\", the \"Nyayasutra\", the \"Markandeya Purana\", the \"Mahabharata\", the \"Nitishastra\" and others to provide the context, per the norms of its literary traditions. The extant translations of the \"Kamasutra\" typically incorporate these commentaries, states Dani\u00e9lou.\nIn the colonial era marked by sexual censorship, the \"Kamasutra\" became famous as a pirated and underground text for its explicit description of sex positions. The stereotypical image of the text is one where erotic pursuit with sexual intercourse include improbable contortionist forms. In reality, according to Doniger, the \"real Kamasutra\" is much more and is a book about \"the art of living\", about understanding one's body and a partner's body, finding a partner and emotional connection, marriage, the power equation over time in intimate relationships, the nature of adultery and drugs (aphrodisiacs) along with many simple to complex variations in sex positions to explore. It is also a psychological treatise that presents the effect of desire and pleasure on human behavior.\nFor each aspect of \"Kama\", the \"Kamasutra\" presents a diverse spectrum of options and regional practices. According to Shastri, as quoted by Doniger, the text analyses \"the inclinations of men, good and bad\", thereafter it presents Vatsyayana's recommendation and arguments of what one must avoid as well as what to not miss in experiencing and enjoying, with \"acting only on the good\". For example, the text discusses adultery but recommends a faithful spousal relationship. The approach of \"Kamasutra\" is not to ignore nor deny the psychology and complexity of human behavior for pleasure and sex. The text, according to Doniger, clearly states \"that a treatise demands the inclusion of everything, good or bad\", but after being informed with in-depth knowledge, one must \"reflect and accept only the good\". The approach found in the text is one where goals of science and religion should not be to repress, but to encyclopedically know and understand, thereafter let the individual decide. The text states that it aims to be comprehensive and inclusive of diverse views and lifestyles.\nFlirting and courtship.\nThe 3rd-century text includes a number of themes, including subjects such as flirting that resonate in the modern era context, states a \"New York Times\" review. For example, it suggests that a young man seeking to attract a woman, should hold a party, and invite the guests to recite poetry. In the party, a poem should be read with parts missing, and the guests should compete to creatively complete the poem. As another example, the \"Kamasutra\" suggests that the boy and the girl should go play together, such as swim in a river. The boy should dive into the water away from the girl he is interested in, then swim underwater to get close to her, emerge from the water and surprise her, touch her slightly and then dive again, away from her.\nBook 3 of the \"Kamasutra\" is largely dedicated to the art of courtship with the aim of marriage. The book's opening verse declares marriage to be a conducive means to \"a pure and natural love between the partners\", states Upadhyaya. It leads to emotional fulfillment in many forms such as more friends for both, relatives, progeny, amorous and sexual relationship between the couple, and the conjugal pursuit of \"dharma\" (spiritual and ethical life) and \"artha\" (economic life). The first three chapters discuss how a man should go about finding the right bride, while the fourth offers equivalent discussion for a woman and how she can get the man she wants. The text states that a person should be realistic, and must possess the \"same qualities which one expects from the partner\". It suggests involving one's friends and relatives in the search, and meeting the current friends and relatives of one's future partner prior to the marriage. While the original text makes no mention of astrology and horoscopes, later commentaries, such as one by 13th-century Yashodhara includes consulting and comparing the compatibility of the horoscopes, omens, planetary alignments, and such signs prior to proposing a marriage. Vatsyayana recommends, states Alain Danielou, that \"one should play, marry, associate with one's equals, people of one's own circle\" who share the same values and religious outlook. It is more difficult to manage a good, happy relationship when there are basic differences between the two, according to verse 3.1.20 of the \"Kamasutra\".\nIntimacy and foreplay.\nVatsyayana's \"Kamasutra\" describes intimacy of various forms, including those between lovers before and during sex. For example, the text discusses eight forms of \"alingana\" (embrace) in verses 2.2.7\u201323: \"sphrishtaka\", \"viddhaka\", \"udghrishtaka\", \"piditaka\", \"lataveshtitaka\", \"vrikshadhirudha\", \"tilatandula\" and \"kshiranira\". The first four are expressive of mutual love, but are nonsexual. The last four are forms of embrace recommended by Vatsyayana to increase pleasure during foreplay and during sexual intimacy. Vatsyayana cites earlier \u2013 now lost \u2013 Indian texts from the Babhraya's school, for these eight categories of embraces. The various forms of intimacy reflect the intent and provide means to engage a combination of senses for pleasure. For instance, according to Vatsyayana the \"lalatika\" form enables both to feel each other and allows the man to visually appreciate \"the full beauty of the female form\", states S.C. Upadhyaya.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOn sexual embraces\n&lt;poem&gt;\nSome sexual embraces, not in this text,\nalso intensify passion;\nthese, too, may be used for love-making,\nbut only with care.\nThe territory of the text extends\nonly so far as men have dull appetites;\nbut when the wheel of sexual ecstasy is in full motion,\nthere is no textbook at all, and no order.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\n\u2014\"Kamasutra 2.2.30\u201331\",&lt;br&gt;Translator: Wendy Doniger and Sudhir Kakar\nAnother example of the forms of intimacy discussed in the \"Kamasutra\" includes \"chumbanas\" (kissing). The text presents twenty-six forms of kisses, ranging from those appropriate for showing respect and affection, to those during foreplay and sex. Vatsyayana also mentions variations in kissing cultures in different parts of ancient India. The best kiss for an intimate partner, according to \"kamasutra\", is one that is based on the awareness of the \"avastha\" (the emotional state of one's partner) when the two are not in a sexual union. During sex, the text recommends going with the flow and mirroring with \"abhiyoga\" and \"samprayoga\".\nOther techniques of foreplay and sexual intimacy that are described in the \"kamasutra\" include; various forms of holding and embraces (\"grahana\", \"upaguhana\"), mutual massage and rubbing (\"mardana\"), pinching and biting, using fingers and hands to stimulate (\"karikarakrida\", \"nadi-kshobana\", \"anguli-pravesha\"), three styles of \"jihva-pravesha\" (french kissing), and many styles of fellatio and cunnilingus.\nAdultery.\nThe \"Kamasutra\", states the Indologist and Sanskrit literature scholar Ludo Rocher, discourages adultery but then devotes \"not less than fifteen sutras (1.5.6\u201320) to enumerating the reasons (\"karana\") for which a man is allowed to seduce a married woman\". Vatsyayana mentions different types of \"nayikas\" (urban girls) such as unmarried virgins, those married and abandoned by husband, widow seeking remarriage and courtesans, then discusses their kama/sexual education, rights and mores. In childhood, V\u0101tsy\u0101yana says, a person should learn how to make a living; youth is the time for pleasure, and as years pass, one should concentrate on living virtuously and hope to escape the cycle of rebirth.\nAccording to Doniger, the \"Kamasutra\" teaches adulterous sexual liaison as a means for a man to predispose the involved woman in assisting him, as a strategic means to work against his enemies and to facilitate his successes. It also explains the signs and reasons a woman wants to enter into an adulterous relationship and when she does not want to commit adultery. The \"Kamasutra\" teaches strategies to engage in adulterous relationships, but concludes its chapter on sexual liaison stating that one should not commit adultery because adultery pleases only one of two sides in a marriage, hurts the other, it goes against both \"dharma\" and \"artha\".\nCaste, class.\nThe \"Kamasutra\" has been one of the unique sources of sociological information and cultural milieu of ancient India. It shows a \"near total disregard of class (varna) and caste (jati)\", states Doniger. Human relationships, including the sexual type, are neither segregated nor repressed by gender or caste, rather linked to individual's wealth (success in \"artha\"). In the \"Kamasutra\", lovers are \"not upper-class\" but they \"must be rich\" enough to dress well, pursue social leisure activities, buy gifts and surprise the lover. In the rare mention of caste, it is about a man finding his legal wife and the advice that humorous stories to seduce a woman should be about \"other virgins of same \"jati\" (caste)\". In general, the text describes sexual activity between men and women across class and caste, both in urban and rural settings.\nSame-sex relationships.\nThe \"Kamasutra\" includes verses describing homosexual relations such as oral sex between two men, as well as between two women. Lesbian relations are extensively covered in Chapters 5 and 8 in Book 2. The text also mentions \"pretend play\", sadomasochism, and group sex.\nAccording to Doniger, the \"Kamasutra\" discusses same-sex relationships through the notion of the \"tritiya prakriti\", literally, \"third sexuality\" or \"third nature\". In \"Redeeming the Kamasutra,\" Doniger states that \"the Kamasutra departs from the dharmic view of homosexuality in significant ways\", where the term \"kliba\" appears. In contemporary translations, this has been inaccurately rendered as \"eunuch\" \u2013 or, a castrated man in a harem, and the royal harem did not exist in India before the Turkish presence in the ninth century. The Sanskrit word \"Kliba\" found in older Indian texts refers to a \"man who does not act like a man\", typically in a pejorative sense. The \"Kamasutra\" does not use the pejorative term \"kliba\" at all, but speaks instead of a \"third nature\" or, in the sexual behavior context as the \"third sexuality\".\nThe text states that there are two sorts of \"third nature\", one where a man behaves like a woman, and in the other, a woman behaves like a man. In one of the longest consecutive sets of verses describing a sexual act, the \"Kamasutra\" describes fellatio technique between a man dressed like a woman performing fellatio on another man. The text also mentions same-sex behavior between two women, such as a girl losing her virginity with a girlfriend as they use their fingers, as well as oral sex and the use of sex toys between women. \"Svairini\", a term Danielou translates as a lesbian, is described in the text as a woman who lives a conjugal life with another woman or by herself fending for herself, not interested in a husband. Additionally, the text has some fleeting remarks on bisexual relationships.\nTranslations.\nAccording to Doniger, the historical records suggest that the \"Kamasutra\" was a well-known and popular text in Indian history. This popularity through the Mughal Empire era is confirmed by its regional translations. The Mughals, states Doniger, had \"commissioned lavishly illustrated Persian and Sanskrit \"Kamasutra\" manuscripts\".\nThe first English translation of the \"Kama Sutra\" was privately printed in 1883 by the Orientalist Sir Richard Francis Burton. He did not translate it, but did edit it to suit the Victorian British attitudes. The unedited translation was produced by the Indian scholar Bhagwan Lal Indraji with the assistance of a student Shivaram Parshuram Bhide, under the guidance of Burton's friend, the Indian civil servant Forster Fitzgerald Arbuthnot. According to Doniger, the Burton version is a \"flawed English translation\" but influential as modern translators and abridged versions, even in the Indian languages such as in Hindi, are re-translations of the Burton version, rather than the original Sanskrit manuscript.\nThe Burton version of the \"Kamasutra\" was produced in an environment where the Victorian mindset and Protestant proselytizers were busy finding faults and attacking Hinduism and its culture, rejecting as \"filthy paganism\" anything they found sensuous and sexual in Hindu arts and literature. The \"Hindus were cowering under their scorn\", states Doniger, and the open discussion of sex in the \"Kamasutra\" scandalized the 19th-century Europeans. The Burton edition of the \"Kamasutra\" was illegal to publish in England and the United States till 1962. Yet, states Doniger, it became soon after its publication in 1883, \"one of the most pirated books in the English language\", widely copied, reprinted and republished sometimes without Richard Burton's name.\nBurton made two important contributions to the \"Kamasutra\". First, he had the courage to publish it in the colonial era against the political and cultural mores of the British elite. He creatively found a way to subvert the then prevalent censorship laws of Britain under the Obscene Publications Act of 1857. Burton created a fake publishing house named \"The Kama Shastra Society of London and Benares\" (Benares = Varanasi), with the declaration that it is \"for private circulation only\". The second major contribution was to edit it in a major way, by changing words and rewriting sections to make it more acceptable to the general British public. For example, the original Sanskrit \"Kamasutra\" does not use the words lingam or yoni for sexual organs, and almost always uses other terms. Burton adroitly avoided being viewed as obscene to the Victorian mindset by avoiding the use of words such as penis, vulva, vagina and other direct or indirect sexual terms in the Sanskrit text to discuss sex, sexual relationships and human sexual positions. Burton used the terms lingam and yoni instead throughout the translation. This conscious and incorrect word substitution, states Doniger, thus served as an Orientalist means to \"anthropologize sex, distance it, make it safe for English readers by assuring them, or pretending to assure them, that the text was not about real sexual organs, their sexual organs, but merely about the appendages of weird, dark people far away.\" Though Burton used the terms lingam and yoni for human sexual organs, terms that actually mean a lot more in Sanskrit texts and its meaning depends on the context. However, Burton's \"Kamasutra\" gave a unique, specific meaning to these words in the western imagination.\nThe problems with Burton mistranslation are many, states Doniger. First, the text \"simply does not say what Burton says it says\". Second, it \"robs women of their voices, turning direct quotes into indirect quotes, thus losing the force of the dialogue that animates the work and erasing the vivid presence of the many women who speak in the Kamasutra\". Third, it changes the force of words in the original text. For example, when a woman says \"Stop!\" or \"Let me go!\" in the original text of Vatsyayana, Burton changed it to \"She continually utters words expressive of prohibition, sufficiency, or desire of liberation\", states Doniger, and thus misconstrues the context and intent of the original text. Similarly, while the original \"Kamasutra\" acknowledges that \"women have strong privileges\", Burton erased these passages and thus eroded women's agency in ancient India in the typical Orientialist manner that dehumanized the Indian culture. David Shulman, a professor of Indian Studies and Comparative Religion, agrees with Doniger that the Burton translation is misguided and flawed. The Burton version was written with a different mindset, one that treated \"sexual matters with Victorian squeamishness and a pornographic delight in the indirect\", according to Shulman. It has led to a misunderstanding of the text and created the wrong impression of it being ancient \"Hindu pornography\".\nIn 1961, S. C. Upadhyaya published his translation as the \"Kamasutra of Vatsyayana: Complete Translation from the Original\". According to Jyoti Puri, it is considered among the best-known scholarly English-language translations of the \"Kamasutra\" in post-independent India.\nOther translations include those by Alain Dani\u00e9lou (\"The Complete Kama Sutra\" in 1994). This translation, originally into French, and thence into English, featured the original text attributed to Vatsyayana, along with a medieval and a modern commentary. Unlike the 1883 version, Dani\u00e9lou's new translation preserves the numbered verse divisions of the original, and does not incorporate notes in the text. He includes English translations of two important commentaries, one by Jayamangala, and a more modern commentary by Devadatta Shastri, as endnotes. Doniger questions the accuracy of Dani\u00e9lou's translation, stating that he has freely reinterpreted the \"Kamasutra\" while disregarding the gender that is implicit in the Sanskrit words. He, at times, reverses the object and subject, making the woman the subject and man the object when the \"Kamasutra\" is explicitly stating the reverse. According to Doniger, \"even this cryptic text [\"Kamasutra\"] is not infinitely elastic\" and such creative reinterpretations do not reflect the text.\nA translation by Indra Sinha was published in 1980. In the early 1990s, its chapter on sexual positions began circulating on the Internet as an independent text and today is often assumed to be the whole of the \"Kama Sutra\".\nDoniger and Sudhir Kakar published another translation in 2002, as a part of the Oxford World's Classics series. Along with the translation, Doniger has published numerous articles and book chapters relating to the \"Kamasutra\". The Doniger translation and \"Kamasutra\"-related literature has both been praised and criticized. According to David Shulman, the Doniger translation \"will change peoples' understanding of this book and of ancient India. Previous translations are hopelessly outdated, inadequate and misguided\". Narasingha Sil calls the Doniger's work as \"another signature work of translation and exegesis of the much misunderstood and abused Hindu erotology\". Her translation has the folksy, \"twinkle prose\", engaging style, and an original translation of the Sanskrit text. However, adds Sil, Doniger's work mixes her postmodern translation and interpretation of the text with her own \"political and polemical\" views. She makes sweeping generalizations and flippant insertions that are supported by neither the original text nor the weight of evidence in other related ancient and later Indian literature such as from the Bengal Renaissance movement \u2013 one of the scholarly specialty of Narasingha Sil. Doniger's presentation style titillates, yet some details misinform and parts of her interpretations are dubious, states Sil.\nAnalysis.\nIndira Kapoor, a director of the International Planned Parenthood Foundation, states that the \"Kamasutra\" is a treatise on human sexual behavior and an ancient attempt to seriously study sexuality among other things. According to Kapoor, quotes Jyoti Puri, the attitude of contemporary Indians is markedly different, with misconceptions and expressions of embarrassment, rather than curiosity and pride, when faced with texts such as \"Kamasutra\" and amorous and erotic arts found in Hindu temples. \"Kamasutra\", states Kapoor, must be viewed as a means to discover and improve the \"self-confidence and understanding of their bodies and feelings\".\nThe \"Kamasutra\" has been a popular reference to erotic ancient literature. In the Western media, such as in the American women's magazine \"Redbook\", the Kamasutra is described as \"Although it was written centuries ago, there's still no better sex handbook, which details hundreds of positions, each offering a subtle variation in pleasure to men and women.\"\nJyoti Puri, who published a review and feminist critique of the text, stated that the \"\"Kamasutra\" is frequently appropriated as indisputable evidence of a non-Western and tolerant, indeed celebratory, view of sexuality\" and for \"the belief that the \"Kamasutra\" provides a transparent glimpse into the positive, even exalted, view of sexuality\". However, according to Puri, this is a colonial and anticolonial modernist interpretation of the text. These narratives neither resonate with nor provide the \"politics of gender, race, nationality and class\" that may have been prevalent in ancient India as published by other historians .\nAccording to Doniger, the \"Kama Sutra\" is a \"great cultural masterpiece\", one which can inspire contemporary Indians to overcome \"self-doubts and rejoice\" in their ancient heritage.\nIn popular culture.\nList of feature films based on the \"Kama Sutra\": \nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nOriginal and translations"}

His music is primarily instrumental, with occasional vocalizations. Most of Arkenstone's music falls into new age category; however, he also worked in other genres, including even a heavy metal soundtrack for \"\" video game. His music has been described as 'soundtracks for the imagination'. Throughout his career, Arkenstone released over 50 albums and composed music for video games, including \"World of Warcraft\", and for television, including NBC's Kentucky Derby. Arkenstone has been nominated for Grammy Awards five times.\nBiography.\nAfter moving from Chicago to California at the age of ten, he was involved in various high school bands playing guitars and keyboards, playing baseball in his spare time. He studied music in college and started a progressive rock band named after himself, but he soon discovered his own musical voice in the instrumental genre. Arkenstone was influenced by writers such as J. R. R. Tolkien and Ian Fleming, and grew up listening to bands like Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, Deep Purple, and Yes, as well as listening to classical music.\nArkenstone went solo and found his own sound in New Age music. He says that has been greatly aided by technology: \"Technology has produced some wonderful tools for making music. The computer allows me to fully orchestrate my pieces and really fine tune them\". His music is primarily instrumental. His albums, typically fantasy themed, often come packaged with literature and art. He worked with fantasy novel writer Mercedes Lackey on a few of her albums. Arkenstone and his ex-wife Diane created their own record label called Neo Pacifica. In addition to releasing their own music on the label, they have included other bands such as Earth Trybe, Enaid, and the Marquis Ensemble.\nHe has also composed music for television; channels such as the History Channel, the Discovery Channel and NBC Sports include his music. He has also written music for trailers and film soundtracks, including the independent film \"PRISM\", as well as computer game soundtracks such as \"World of Warcraft\", ' and \"3\", \"Earth and Beyond\", ', and \"Space Siege\". He also features on \"20 Years of Narada Piano\".\nArkenstone has earned five Grammy nominations for his work: \"In the Wake of the Wind\" in 1992, \"Citizen of the World\" in 2000, \"Atlantis\" in 2004,\"Fairy Dreams\" in 2020, and \"Pangaea\" in 2022.\nArkenstone has learned to play a variety of musical instruments, including bouzouki, mandolin, guitar, bass guitar, harp, cello, flute, electronic keyboards, piano, Turkish saz, pennywhistle, melodica, and pan pipes. He also plays drums and percussion and has performed some vocalizations on his albums.\nArkenstone is also involved in the band Troika; their sound is similar to his solo work. The band members like to remain anonymous, although the compositions are credited to Arkenstone.\nHis theme \"The Journey Begins/Kyla's Ride\" was used for the FIFA World Cup France '98 broadcastings intro by the Mexican television network Azteca.\nHis song \"Papillon (On the Wings of the Butterfly)\" was formerly used as background music in Future World at Epcot in Walt Disney World. His song \"The Palace\" was once used as background music in Tomorrowland at the Magic Kingdom as well. \"The Palace\" also used to play in Tokyo Disneyland's Tomorrowland, and another one of his songs, \"Valley in the Clouds\" was also used.\nHe signed with Domo Records and re-released the album \"Echoes of Light and Shadow\" in 2010.\nArkenstone was a member of the composing team who developed the music for Blizzard Activision's \"World of Warcraft\" videogame's\" Cataclysm\" expansion.

The group has seen many personnel changes over the years, with Froese the only constant member until his death in January 2015. The best-known lineup of the group was its mid-1970s trio of Froese, Christopher Franke, and Peter Baumann. In 1979, Johannes Schmoelling replaced Baumann until his own departure in 1985. This lineup was notable for composing many movie soundtracks. Since Froese's death in 2015, the group has been under the leadership of Thorsten Quaeschning. Quaeschning is Froese's chosen successor and is currently the longest-serving band member, having joined in 2005. Quaeschning is currently joined by violinist Hoshiko Yamane who joined in 2011 and Paul Frick who joined in 2020. Prior to this Quaeschning and Yamane performed with Ulrich Schnauss from 2014 to 2020. Schnauss only played two shows with Froese in November 2014 before Froese's passing.\nTangerine Dream are considered a pioneering act in electronica. Their work with the electronic music Ohr label produced albums that had a pivotal role in the development of the German musical scene known as kosmische Musik (\"cosmic music\"). Their \"Virgin Years\", so called because of their association with Virgin Records, produced albums that further explored synthesizers and sequencers, including the UK top 20 albums \"Phaedra\" (1974) and \"Rubycon\" (1975). The group also had a successful career composing film soundtracks, creating over 60 scores.\nFrom the late 1990s into the 2000s, Tangerine Dream continued to explore other styles of instrumental music as well as electronica. Their recorded output has been prolific, including over one hundred albums. Among other scoring projects, they helped create the soundtrack for the video game \"Grand Theft Auto V\". Their mid-1970s work has been profoundly influential in the development of electronic music styles such as new-age and electronic dance music.\nOn 29 September 2017, the band released an all-new music studio album entitled \"Quantum Gate\". In December 2019, they released \"Recurring Dreams\", a compilation of new recordings of some of the band's classic compositions. On 26 November 2021, the band released an EP entitled \"Probe 6\u20138\" (including three tracks: \"Raum\", \"Para Guy\" and \"Continuum\"), whose concept was developed further on their following album \"Raum\", their latest studio album to date which was released on 25 February 2022.\nHistory.\nOrigins: psychedelia and krautrock.\nEdgar Froese arrived in West Berlin in the mid-1960s to study art. His first band, the psychedelic rock-styled \"The Ones\", disbanded after releasing only one single. After The Ones, Froese experimented with musical ideas, playing smaller gigs with a variety of musicians. Most of these performances were in the famous Zodiak Free Arts Lab, although one grouping also had the distinction of being invited to play for the surrealist painter Salvador Dal\u00ed. The music was partnered with literature, painting, early forms of multimedia, and more. It seemed as though only the most outlandish ideas attracted any attention, leading Froese to comment: \"In the absurd often lies what is artistically possible.\" As members of the group came and went, the direction of the music continued to be inspired by the Surrealists, and the group came to be called by the surreal-sounding name of Tangerine Dream, inspired by mishearing the line \"tangerine trees and marmalade skies\" from the Beatles' track \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\".\nFroese was fascinated by technology and skilled in using it to create music. He built custom-made instruments and, wherever he went, collected sounds with tape recorders for use in constructing musical works later. His early work with tape loops and other repeating sounds was the obvious precursor to the emerging technology of the sequencer, which Tangerine Dream quickly adopted upon its arrival.\nReleased in 1970 by record label Ohr, the first Tangerine Dream album, \"Electronic Meditation\", was a tape-collage Krautrock piece, using the technology of the time rather than the synthesized music they later became famous for. The line-up for the album was Froese, Klaus Schulze, and Conrad Schnitzler. \"Electronic Meditation\" began the period known as the \"Pink Years\" (the Ohr logo was a pink ear). Subsequent albums, beginning with \"Alpha Centauri\", relied heavily on electronic instruments. The band's music during the early 1970s prominently featured organ from Steve Schroyder (on \"Alpha Centauri\") or Peter Baumann (on subsequent releases), commonly augmented by guitar from Froese and drums from Christopher Franke. They also started their heavy usage of the Mellotron during this period.\nRise to fame: the Virgin years.\nThe band's 1973 album \"Atem\" was named as one of British DJ John Peel's records of the year, and this attention helped Tangerine Dream to sign to the fledgling Virgin Records in the same year. Soon afterward, they released the album \"Phaedra\", an eerie soundscape that unexpectedly reached No. 15 in the UK Albums Chart and became one of Virgin's first bona fide hits. \"Phaedra\" was one of the first commercial albums to feature sequencers and came to define much more than just the band's own sound. The creation of the album's title track was something of an accident: the band was experimenting in the studio with a recently acquired Moog synthesizer, and the tape happened to be rolling at the time. They kept the results and later added recorder, bass guitar, and Mellotron performances. The Moog, like many other early synthesizers, was so sensitive to changes in temperature that its oscillators would drift badly in tuning as the equipment warmed up, and this drift can easily be heard on the final recording. This album marked the beginning of the period known as the 'Virgin Years'.\nTheir mid-1970s work has been profoundly influential in the development of electronic music styles such as new-age (although the band themselves disliked the term) and electronic dance music.\nIn the 1980s, along with other electronic music pioneers such as Jean-Michel Jarre (with whom Edgar Froese collaborated on Jarre's 2015 album \"\") and Vangelis, the band were early adopters of the new digital technology, which revolutionized the sound of the synthesizer, although the group had been using digital equipment (in some shape or form) as early as the mid-1970s. Their technical competence and extensive experience in their early years with self-made instruments and unusual means of creating sounds meant that they were able to exploit this new technology to make music quite unlike anything heard before.\nTangerine Dream live.\nTangerine Dream's earliest concerts were visually simple by modern standards, with three men sitting motionless for hours alongside massive electronic boxes festooned with patch cords and a few flashing lights. Some concerts were even performed in complete darkness, as happened during the performance at York Minster on 20 October 1975. As time went on and technology advanced, the concerts became much more elaborate, with visual effects, lighting, lasers, pyrotechnics, and projected images. By 1977 their North American tour featured full-scale Laserium effects.\nThrough the 1970s and 1980s, the band toured extensively. The concerts generally included large amounts of unreleased and improvised material and were consequently widely bootlegged. They were notorious for playing extremely loudly and for a long time. The band released recordings of a fair number of their concerts, and on some of these the band worked out material that would later form the backbone of their studio recordings.\nForays into vocals.\nMost of Tangerine Dream's albums are entirely instrumental. Two earlier albums that prominently featured lyrics were \"Cyclone\" (1978) and \"Tyger\" (1987). While there were occasionally a few vocals on the band's other releases, such as the track \"Kiew Mission\" from 1981's \"Exit\" and \"The Harbor\" from 1987's \"Shy People\", the group only returned to featuring vocals on a larger scale in a musical trilogy based on Dante's \"Divine Comedy\". This was followed by a 2007 album \"Madcap's Flaming Duty\" and a 2010 cover collection \"Under Cover \u2013 Chapter One\".\nAfter their 1980 East Berlin gig, when they became one of the first major Western bands to perform in a communist country, Tangerine Dream released a double live album of one of their performances there, called \"Poland\", recorded during their tour in the winter at the end of 1983. With \"Poland\", the band moved to the Jive Electro label, marking the beginning of the \"Blue Years\".\nSoundtracks.\nThroughout the 1980s, Tangerine Dream composed scores for more than 20 films. This had been an interest of Froese's since the late 1960s, when he scored and acted in the experimental film \"Auf Schei\u00dfer schie\u00dft man nicht\", directed by Hansj\u00fcrgen Pohland. Many of the group's soundtracks were composed at least partially of reworked material from the band's studio albums or work that was in progress for upcoming albums; see, for example, the resemblance between the track \"Igneous\" on their soundtrack for \"Thief\" and the track \"Thru Metamorphic Rocks\" on their studio release \"Force Majeure\". Their first exposure on US television came when a track for the then in-progress album \"Le Parc\" was used as the theme for the television program, \"Street Hawk\". Some of the more famous soundtracks have been \"Sorcerer\", \"Thief\", \"Legend\", \"Risky Business\", \"The Keep\", \"Firestarter\", \"Flashpoint\", \"Heartbreakers\", \"Shy People\", and \"Near Dark\".\nTangerine Dream also composed 35 hours of music stems for the video game, \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIn 2016, Tangerine Dream released their own version of the theme music for the television series \"Stranger Things\". Tangerine Dream had inspired music for the series.\nGoing independent.\nSeveral of the band's albums released during the 1990s were nominated for Grammy Awards. Since then, Tangerine Dream with Jerome Froese took a directional change away from the new-age leanings of those albums and toward an electronica style. After Jerome's departure, founder Edgar Froese steered the band in a direction somewhat reminiscent of material throughout their career.\nIn later years, Tangerine Dream released albums in series. The \"Dream Mixes\" series began in 1995 with the last being released in 2010. The \"Divine Comedy\" series, based on the writings of Dante Alighieri, spanned 2002\u20132006. From 2007 to 2010, the \"Five Atomic Seasons\" were released. Most recently, the \"Eastgate Sonic Poems\" series, based on the works of famous poetic authors such as Edgar Allan Poe and Franz Kafka, began in 2011, with the last appearing in 2013. Also, beginning in 2007, Tangerine Dream released a number of EPs, referred to as \"CupDiscs\" by the band.\nEdgar Froese also released a number of solo recordings, which are similar in style to Tangerine Dream's work. Jerome Froese released a number of singles as TDJ Rome, which are similar to his work within the \"Dream Mixes\" series. In 2005, he released his first solo album \"Neptunes\" under the name Jerome Froese. In 2006, Jerome left Tangerine Dream to concentrate on his solo career. His second solo album \"Shiver Me Timbers\" was released on 29 October 2007, and his third, \"Far Side of the Face\", was released in 2012. Beginning in 2011, Jerome Froese joined with former Tangerine Dream member Johannes Schmoelling and keyboardist Robert Waters to form the band Loom, which plays original material, as well as Tangerine Dream classics. Thorsten Quaeschning, leader of Picture Palace Music, was brought into Tangerine Dream in 2005 and contributed to most of the band's albums and CupDiscs since then.\nThe group had recording contracts with Ohr, Virgin, Jive Electro, Private Music, and Miramar, and many of the minor soundtracks were released on Var\u00e8se Sarabande. In 1996, the band founded their own record label, TDI, and more recently, Eastgate. Subsequent albums are today generally not available in normal retail channels but are sold by mail-order or through online channels. The same applies to their Miramar releases, the rights to which the band bought back. Meanwhile, their Ohr and Jive Electro catalogs (known as the \"Pink\" and \"Blue\" Years) are currently owned by Esoteric Recordings. \nSince 2017, Tangerine Dream has been signed to the independent label Kscope, which has released their studio albums Quantum Gate, Recurring Dreams and Raum.\nConcert updates.\nTo celebrate their 40th anniversary (1967\u20132007), Tangerine Dream announced their only UK concert: at London Astoria on 20 April 2007. The band also played a totally free open-air concert in Eberswalde on 1 July 2007 and at the Alte Oper in Frankfurt on Main on 7 October 2007. 2008 saw the band in Eindhoven Netherlands playing at E-Day (an electronic music festival); later in the year they also played the Night of the Prog Festival in Loreley, Germany, as well as concerts at the Kentish Town Forum, in London on 1 November, at the Picture House, Edinburgh on 2 November, and their first live concert in the US for over a decade, at the UCLA Royce Hall, Los Angeles on 7 November.\nIn 2009, the group announced that they would play a concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London, on 1 April 2010, titled the Zeitgeist concert, 35 years after their milestone concert there on 2 April 1975. The entire concert was released as a 3-CD live album on 7 July 2010.\nTangerine Dream embarked in spring and summer 2012 on a tour of Europe, Canada and the USA called \"The Electric Mandarine Tour 2012\": The 1st leg was a 5-date European tour, beginning on 10 April in Budapest (Hungary) via Padua (Italy), Milano (Italy), Zurich (Switzerland), and ending on 10 May in Berlin (Germany). The 2nd leg was a North-American tour that started with the Jazz Festival in Montr\u00e9al (Canada) on 30 June, followed by a concert on 4 July at the Bluesfest in Ottawa (Canada) and continued as a 10-date US journey beginning in July in Boston, then New York, Philadelphia, Washington, and California. On 16 November 2014, Tangerine Dream performed in Melbourne, Australia, as part of Melbourne Music Week. They were the final shows with Froese. Tangerine Dream played two consecutive nights at the Union Chapel, Islington London on April 23 &amp; 24 2018, the second supported by ex-Japan and Porcupine Tree musician Richard Barbieri. In October and November 2019, Tangerine Dream went on its 16 step \"Random &amp; Revision\" Tour.\n2023 saw the band embark on the largest tour of their entire career, including a 19-date tour of North America (September 8 \u2013 October 5: taking in Miami, Asheville, Atlanta, Dallas, Austin, Albuquerque, Tucson, San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, Vancouver, Seattle, Philadelphia, Washington, New York, Montreal, Toronto and Chicago), 13-dates in Germany (October 10 \u2013 28), and 10-dates in the UK (November 5 \u2013 14)\nAfter Edgar Froese's death.\nEdgar Froese died suddenly in Vienna on 20 January 2015 from a pulmonary embolism. On 6 April 2015, the group's remaining members (Quaeschning, Schnauss and Yamane) and Bianca Acquaye (Froese's widow), pledged to continue working together in an effort to fulfill Froese's vision for the group. However, ex-member Jerome Froese announced on his Facebook timeline that, in his opinion, Tangerine Dream will not exist without his father.\nTangerine Dream played their first show following Froese's death on 9 June 2016 in Szczecin, Poland.\nOn 29 September 2017, Tangerine Dream released their new studio album entitled, \"Quantum Gate\", celebrating the 50th anniversary of the band's foundation. The album is based on ideas and musical sketches by founder Edgar Froese and was completed by the remaining members of the band.\nOn 31 January 2020, Tangerine Dream re-released their December 2019 album \"Recurring Dreams\", an eleven-track collection of new recordings of some of the band's classic tracks, worldwide through Kscope. This was launched to coincide with the \"Tangerine Dream: Zeitraffer\" exhibition, which opened on 17 January 2020 at London's Barbican and runs until 2 May 2020.\nOn 9 June 2020, Paul Frick became the first member to join the group following Edgar's death after having made guest appearances with the band, starting in November 2018. Later on, the group started working on a new studio album entitled, \"Raum\", featuring Froese's archival recordings in early 2022 via Kscope. Frick has the unique distinction of being the first addition to the group who did not ever personally meet Froese.\nIt was announced on 22 June 2021 that Ulrich Schnauss has decided to stop performing live. Since then, the band's official website lists him as a former member.\nIn March 2023, the band embarked on the longest tour of their entire career, with concerts in Portugal (Casa da M\u00fasica), Switzerland (Geneva's Electron Festival), the Netherlands (3-date tour), Belgium (Het Depot), France (La Ga\u00eet\u00e9 Lyrique), Poland (2-date tour), Romania (Transilvania International Film Festival), the United States (16-date tour), Canada (3-date tour), Germany (12-date tour), the United Kingdom (10-date tour), and Poland (1-date).\nArtistic connections.\nInfluences.\nTangerine Dream began as a surreal krautrock band, with each of the members contributing different musical influences and styles, before becoming a \"revered progressive electronic act.\" Edgar Froese's guitar style was inspired by Jimi Hendrix, as well as the avant-garde composers Iannis Xenakis and Karlheinz Stockhausen, while Christopher Franke contributed elements of Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti and Terry Riley. Yes-like progressive rock influence was brought in by Steve Jolliffe on \"Cyclone\". The sample-based sound collages of Johannes Schmoelling drew their inspiration from a number of sources; one instance is Steve Reich's Music for 18 Musicians on parts of \"Logos Live\", and the track \"Love on a Real Train\" from the \"Risky Business\" soundtrack.\nClassical music has had an influence on the sound of Tangerine Dream over the years. Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti, Johann Sebastian Bach, Pierre Boulez, Iannis Xenakis, Maurice Ravel, and Arcangelo Corelli are clearly visible as dominant influences in the early albums. A Baroque sensibility sometimes informs the more coordinated sequencer patterns, which has its most direct expression in the La Folia section that comes at the very end of the title track of Force Majeure. In live performances, the piano solos often directly quoted from Romantic classical works for piano, such as the Beethoven and Mozart snippets in much of the late 1970s \u2013 early 1980s stage shows. In the bootleg recording of the Mannheim Mozartsaal concert of 1976 (Tangerine Tree volume 13), the first part of the first piece also clearly quotes from Franz Liszt's \"Totentanz\". The first phrase is played on a harpsichord synthesizer patch and is answered by the second half of the phrase in a flute voicing on a Mellotron. During the 1990s, many releases included recordings of classical compositions: Pictures at an Exhibition (on \"Turn of the Tides\"), Largo (from Xerxes) (on \"Tyranny of Beauty\"), Symphony in A Minor (by J. S. Bach), and Concerto in A Major / Adagio (by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) (both on \"Ambient Monkeys\").\nSince the 1990s, Tangerine Dream have also recorded cover versions of Jimi Hendrix' \"Purple Haze\" (first on \"220 Volt Live\") and The Beatles' \"Eleanor Rigby\", \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\", \"Tomorrow Never Knows\", and \"Norwegian Wood\".\nAn infrequently recurring non-musical influence on Tangerine Dream, and Edgar Froese in particular, have been 12th\u201319th-century poets. This was first evident on the 1981 album \"Exit\", the track title \"Pilots of the Purple Twilight\" being a quote from Alfred Lord Tennyson's poem \"Locksley Hall\". Six years later, the album \"Tyger\" featured poems from William Blake set to music; and around the turn of the millennium, Edgar Froese started working on a musical trilogy based on Dante Alighieri's \"Divine Comedy\", completed in 2006. Most recently, the 2007 album \"Madcap's Flaming Duty\" features more poems set to music, some again from Blake but also e.g. Walt Whitman.\nPink Floyd were also an influence on Edgar Froese and Tangerine Dream, the band in its very early psychedelic rock band phase playing improvisations based on Pink Floyd's \"Interstellar Overdrive\". \"Madcap's Flaming Duty\" is dedicated to the memory of the late Syd Barrett. The title refers to Barrett's solo release \"The Madcap Laughs\".\nThe band's influence can be felt in ambient artists such as Deepspace, The Future Sound of London, David Kristian, and Global Communication, as well as rock, pop, and dance artists such as Porcupine Tree, M83, DJ Shadow, Ulrich Schnauss, Cut Copy, and Kasabian. The band also clearly influenced 1990s and 2000s trance music, notably Chicane; both \"Offshore\" and \"Sunstroke\" borrow heavily from \"Love on a Real Train\" where lush soundscapes and synth pads are used along with repetitive synth sequences, much like in their 1975 releases \"Rubycon\" and \"Ricochet\", as well as some of their music from the early 1980s. The group have also been sampled countless times, more recently by Recoil on the album \"SubHuman\", by Sasha on \"Involver\", and on several Houzan Suzuki albums. Michael Jackson also expressed being a fan of Tangerine Dream, specifically their 1977 soundtrack for the film \"Sorcerer\". It inspired him to get a Synclavier II, which a demo of would be used as the intro for Beat It. \nPersonnel.\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, Tangerine Dream existed as several short-lived incarnations, all of which included Froese, who teamed up with several musicians from West Berlin's underground music scene, including Steve Jolliffe, Sven-\u00c5ke Johansson, Klaus Schulze, and Conrad Schnitzler.\nFroese's most notable association was his partnership with Christopher Franke. Franke joined Tangerine Dream in 1970 after serving time in the group Agitation Free, originally to replace Schulze as the drummer. Franke is credited with starting to use electronic sequencers, which were introduced on \"Phaedra\", a development that had not only a large impact on the group's music but on many electronic musicians to this day. Franke stayed with the group for 17 years, leaving in 1988 because of exhausting touring schedules, as well as creative differences with Froese.\nOther long-term members of the group include Peter Baumann (1971\u20131977), who later went on to found the new-age label Private Music, to which the band was signed from 1988 to 1991; Johannes Schmoelling (1979\u20131985); Paul Haslinger (1986\u20131990); Froese's son Jerome Froese (1990\u20132006); Linda Spa (1990\u20131996, 2005\u20132014), a saxophonist &amp; flute player who appeared on numerous albums and concerts, contributing one track on \"Goblins' Club\"; and most recently Thorsten Quaeschning of Picture Palace Music (2005\u2013present).\nA number of other members were also part of Tangerine Dream for shorter periods of time. Unlike session musicians, these players also contributed to compositions of the band during their tenures. Some of the more notable members are Steve Schroyder (organist, 1971\u20131972), Michael Hoenig (who replaced Baumann for a 1975 Australian tour and a London concert, included on \"Bootleg Box Set Vol. 1\"), Steve Jolliffe (wind instruments, keyboards and vocals on \"Cyclone\" and the following tour; he was also part of a short-lived 1969 line-up), Klaus Kr\u00fcger (drummer on \"Cyclone\" and \"Force Majeure\") and Ralf Wadephul (in collaboration with Edgar Froese recorded album \"Blue Dawn\", but it was released only in 2006; also credited for one track on \"Optical Race\" (1988) and toured with the band in support of this album).\nThroughout the 1990s and into the 2000s, Tangerine Dream was often joined on stage by Zlatko Perica or Gerald Gradwohl on guitars, and Emil Hachfeld on electronic drums. Jerome Froese left in 2006 after a concert at the Tempodrom in Berlin. Until late 2014, Tangerine Dream comprised Edgar Froese, as well as Thorsten Quaeschning, who first collaborated in the composition of \"Jeanne d'Arc\" (2005). For concerts and recordings, they were usually joined by Linda Spa on saxophone and flute, Iris Camaa on drums and percussion, and Bernhard Beibl on guitar. In 2011, electric violinist Hoshiko Yamane was added to the lineup and is featured on some of the most recent albums.\nIn late 2014, Bernhard Beibl announced on his Facebook page that he would stop collaborating with Tangerine Dream. Shortly thereafter, it was announced that Tangerine Dream would no longer be touring with Linda Spa or Iris Camaa, but that Ulrich Schnauss had been brought into the fold. Edgar Froese's death in January 2015, however, left this a short-lived line-up.\nMembers.\nBianca Froese-Acquaye, Edgar Froese's widow, has taken up the mantle of continuing the legacy of the group and works closely in a non-musical capacity with the remaining members.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nGuest musicians.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDiscography.\nTangerine Dream has released over one hundred albums (not counting compilations and fan releases) over the last five decades.

Polyps are roughly cylindrical in shape and elongated at the axis of the vase-shaped body. In solitary polyps, the aboral (opposite to oral) end is attached to the substrate by means of a disc-like holdfast called a pedal disc, while in colonies of polyps it is connected to other polyps, either directly or indirectly. The oral end contains the mouth, and is surrounded by a circlet of tentacles.\nClasses.\nIn the class Anthozoa, comprising the sea anemones and corals, the individual is always a polyp; in the class Hydrozoa, however, the individual may be either a polyp or a medusa, with most species undergoing a life cycle with both a polyp stage and a medusa stage.\nIn the class Scyphozoa, the medusa stage is dominant, and the polyp stage may or may not be present, depending on the family. In those scyphozoans that have the larval planula metamorphose into a polyp, the polyp, also called a \"scyphistoma,\" grows until it develops a stack of plate-like medusae that pinch off and swim away in a process known as strobilation. Once strobilation is complete, the polyp may die, or regenerate itself to repeat the process again later. With cubozoans, the planula settles onto a suitable surface, and develops into a polyp. The cubozoan polyp then eventually metamorphoses directly into a medusa.\nAnatomy.\nThe body of the polyp may be roughly compared in a structure to a sac, the wall of which is composed of two layers of cells. The outer layer is known technically as the \"ectoderm\", with the inner layer as the \"endoderm\" (or \"gastroderm\"). Between ectoderm and endoderm is a supporting layer of structureless gelatinous substance termed mesoglea, secreted by the cell layers of the body wall. The mesoglea can be thinner than the endoderm or ectoderm or comprise the bulk of the body as in larger jellyfish. The mesoglea can contain skeletal elements derived from cells migrated from ectoderm.\nThe sac-like body built up in this way is attached usually to some firm object by its blind end, and bears at the upper end the mouth which is surrounded by a circle of tentacles which resemble glove fingers. The tentacles are organs which serve both for the tactile sense and for the capture of food. Polyps extend their tentacles, particularly at night, containing coiled stinging nettle-like cells, or nematocysts, which pierce, poison, and firmly hold living prey paralysing or killing them. Polyp prey includes copepods and fish larvae. Longitudinal muscular fibrils formed from the cells of the ectoderm allow tentacles to contract when conveying the food to the mouth. Similarly, circularly disposed muscular fibrils formed from the endoderm permit tentacles to be protract or thrust out once they are contracted. These muscle fibres belong to the same two systems, allowing the whole body to retract or protrude outwards.\nWe can distinguish therefore in the body of a polyp the column, circular or oval in section, forming the trunk, resting on a base or foot and surmounted by the crown of tentacles, which enclose an area termed the peristome, in the centre of which again is the mouth. Generally, there is no other opening to the body except the mouth, but in some cases excretory pores are known to occur in the foot, and pores may occur at the tips of the tentacles. A polyp is an animal of very simple structure, a living fossil that has not changed significantly for about half a billion years (per generally accepted dating of Cambrian sedimentary rock).\nThe external form of the polyp varies greatly in different cases. The column may be long and slender, or may be so short in the vertical direction that the body becomes disk-like. The tentacles may number many hundreds or may be very few, in rare cases only one or two. They may be long and filamentous, or short and reduced to mere knobs or warts. They may be simple and unbranched, or they may be feathery in pattern. The mouth may be level with the surface of the peristome, or may be projecting and trumpet-shaped. As regards internal structure, polyps exhibit two well-marked types of organization, each characteristic of one of the two classes, Hydrozoa and Anthozoa.\nIn the class Hydrozoa, the polyps are indeed often very simple, like the common little fresh water species of the genus \"Hydra\". Anthozoan polyps, including the corals and sea anemones, are much more complex due to the development of a tubular stomodaeum leading inward from the mouth and a series of radial partitions called mesenteries. Many of the mesenteries project into the enteric cavity but some extend from the body wall to the central stomodaeum.\nReproduction.\nIt is an almost universal attribute of polyps to reproduce asexually by the method of budding. This mode of reproduction may be combined with sexual reproduction, or may be the sole method by which the polyp produces offspring, in which case the polyp is entirely without sexual organs.\nAsexual reproduction.\nIn many cases the buds formed do not separate from the parent but remain in continuity with it, thus forming colonies or stocks, which may reach a great size and contain a vast number of individuals. Slight differences in the method of budding produce great variations in the form of the colonies. The reef-building corals are polyp-colonies, strengthened by the formation of a firm skeleton.\nSexual reproduction.\nAmong sea anemones, sexual plasticity may occur. That is, asexually produced clones derived from a single founder individual can contain both male and female individuals (ramets). When eggs and sperm (gametes) are formed, they can produce zygotes derived from \"selfing\" (within the founding clone) or out-crossing, that then develop into swimming planula larvae.\nThe overwhelming majority of stony coral (\"Scleractinia\") taxa are hermaphroditic in their adult colonies. In these species, there is ordinarily synchronized release of eggs and sperm into the water during brief spawning events. Although some species are capable of self-fertilization to varying extents, cross-fertilization appears to be the dominant mating pattern.\nEtymology.\nThe name polyp was given by Ren\u00e9 Antoine Ferchault de R\u00e9aumur to these organisms from their superficial resemblance to an octopus (, ultimately from Ancient Greek adverb (, \"much\") + noun (, \"foot\")), with its circle of writhing arms round the mouth. This comparison contrasts to the common name \"coral-insects\", applied to the polyps which form coral.\nThreats.\n75% of the world's corals are threatened due to overfishing, destructive fishing, coastal development, pollution, thermal stress, ocean acidification, crown-of-thorns starfish, and introduced invasive species.\nIn recent decades the conditions that corals and polyps have found themselves in have been changing, leading to new diseases being observed in corals in many parts of the world, posing even greater risk to an already pressured animal. Aquatic life has been put under a substantial amount of stress because of the pollutants caused by land-based agriculture. Particularly, exposure to the insecticide profenofos and the fungicide MEMC have played a major part in polyp retraction and biomass decrease.\nThere have been many experiments supporting the hypothesis that heat stress in \"Acropora tenuis\" juvenile polyps provokes an up-regulation of protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. The results vary based on the polyp characteristics such as age, type, and growth stage.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "42564", "revid": "49402000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42564", "title": "Ovipositor", "text": "Anatomical structure for laying eggs\nThe ovipositor is a tube-like organ used by some animals, especially insects, for the laying of eggs. In insects, an ovipositor consists of a maximum of three pairs of appendages. The details and morphology of the ovipositor vary, but typically its form is adapted to functions such as preparing a place for the egg, transmitting the egg, and then placing it properly. For most insects, the organ is used merely to attach the egg to some surface, but for many parasitic species (primarily in wasps and other Hymenoptera), it is a piercing organ as well.\nSome ovipositors only retract partly when not in use, and the basal part that sticks out is known as the scape, or more specifically oviscape, the word \"scape\" deriving from the Latin word , meaning \"stalk\" or \"shaft\".\nIn insects.\nGrasshoppers use their ovipositors to force a burrow into the earth to receive the eggs. Cicadas pierce the wood of twigs with their ovipositors to insert the eggs. Sawflies slit the tissues of plants by means of the ovipositor and so do some species of long-horned grasshoppers. In the ichneumon wasp genus \"Megarhyssa\", the females have a slender ovipositor (terebra) several inches long that is used to drill into the wood of tree trunks. These wasps are parasitic in the larval stage on the larvae of horntail wasps, hence the egg must be deposited directly into the host's body as it is feeding. The ovipositors of \"Megarhyssa\" are among the longest egg-laying organs (relative to body size) known.\nThe stingers of the Aculeata (wasps, hornets, bees, and ants) are ovipositors, highly modified and with associated venom glands. They are used to paralyze prey, or as defensive weapons. The penetrating sting plus venom allows the wasp to lay eggs with less risk of injury from the host. In some cases, the injection also introduces virus particles that suppress the host's immune system and prevent it from destroying the eggs. However, in virtually all stinging Hymenoptera, the ovipositor is no longer used for egg-laying. An exception is the family Chrysididae, members of the Hymenoptera, in which species such as \"Chrysis ignita\" have reduced stinging apparatus and a functional ovipositor. \nFig wasp ovipositors have specialized serrated teeth to penetrate fruits, but gall wasps have either uniform teeth or no teeth on their ovipositors, meaning the morphology of the organ is related to the life history.\nMembers of the Dipteran (fly) families Tephritidae and Pyrgotidae have well-developed ovipositors that are partly retracted when not in use, with the part that sticks out being the oviscape. Oestridae, another family within Diptera, often have short hairy ovipositors, the species \"Cuterebra fontinella\" has one of the shortest within the family.\nOvipositors exist not only in winged insects, but also in Apterygota, where the ovipositor has an additional function in gathering the spermatophore during mating. Little is known about the egg-laying habits of these insects in the wild.\nIn fish.\nFemale bitterlings in the genus \"Rhodeus\" have an ovipositor in the form of a tubular extension of the genital orifice. During breeding season, they use it when depositing eggs in the mantle cavity of freshwater mussels, where their eggs develop in reasonable security. Seahorses have an ovipositor for introducing eggs into the brood pouch of the male, who carries them until it is time to release the fry into a suitable situation in the open water.\nIn amphibians.\nThe marbled newt, or \"Triturus marmoratus,\" females participate in parental investment by ovipositing their eggs. They carefully wrap them in aquatic leaves as a form of protection, scattering them throughout a pond to avoid predation. Females are not able to breathe during the oviposition process; therefore, the benefit to wrapping the eggs outweigh the cost of holding their breath.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCope, T., &amp; Fox, R.

{"id": "42567", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42567", "title": "Spleen", "text": "Immune organ that filters blood\nThe spleen (from xno \" espleen\", &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Tooltip/styles.css\" /&gt; from Ancient Greek \" \u03c3\u03c0\u03bb\u03ae\u03bd\", spl\u1e17n) is an organ found in almost all vertebrates. Similar in structure to a large lymph node, it acts primarily as a blood filter.\nThe spleen plays important roles in regard to red blood cells (erythrocytes) and the immune system. It removes old red blood cells and holds a reserve of blood, which can be valuable in case of hemorrhagic shock, and also recycles iron. As a part of the mononuclear phagocyte system, it metabolizes hemoglobin removed from senescent red blood cells. The globin portion of hemoglobin is degraded to its constitutive amino acids, and the heme portion is metabolized to bilirubin, which is removed in the liver.\nThe spleen houses antibody-producing lymphocytes in its white pulp and monocytes which remove antibody-coated bacteria and antibody-coated blood cells by way of blood and lymph node circulation. These monocytes, upon moving to injured tissue (such as the heart after myocardial infarction), turn into dendritic cells and macrophages while promoting tissue healing. The spleen is a center of activity of the mononuclear phagocyte system and is analogous to a large lymph node, as its absence causes a predisposition to certain infections.\nIn humans, the spleen is purple in color and is in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. The surgical process to remove the spleen is known as a splenectomy.\nStructure.\nIn humans, the spleen is underneath the left part of the diaphragm, and has a smooth, convex surface that faces the diaphragm. It is underneath the ninth, tenth, and eleventh ribs. The other side of the spleen is divided by a ridge into two regions: an anterior gastric portion, and a posterior renal portion. The gastric surface is directed forward, upward, and toward the middle, is broad and concave, and is in contact with the posterior wall of the stomach. Below this it is in contact with the tail of the pancreas. The renal surface is directed medialward and downward. It is somewhat flattened, considerably narrower than the gastric surface, and is in relation with the upper part of the anterior surface of the left kidney and occasionally with the left adrenal gland.\nThere are four ligaments attached to the spleen: gastrosplenic ligament, splenorenal ligament, colicosplenic ligament, and phrenocolic ligament.\nMeasurements.\nThe spleen, in healthy adult humans, is approximately in length. It weighs between (standard reference range), correlating mainly to height, body weight and degree of acute congestion but not to sex or age.\nBlood supply.\nNear the middle of the spleen is a long fissure, the hilum, which is the point of attachment for the gastrosplenic ligament and the point of insertion for the splenic artery and splenic vein. There are other openings present for lymphatic vessels and nerves. In addition to the splenic artery, collateral blood supply is provided by the adjacent short gastric arteries.\nLike the thymus, the spleen possesses only efferent lymphatic vessels. The spleen is part of the lymphatic system. Both the short gastric arteries and the splenic artery supply it with blood.\nThe germinal centers are supplied by arterioles called \"penicilliary radicles\".\nNerve supply.\nThe spleen is innervated by the splenic plexus, which connects a branch of the celiac ganglia to the vagus nerve.\nThe underlying central nervous processes coordinating the spleen's function seem to be embedded into the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis, and the brainstem, especially the subfornical organ.\nDevelopment.\nThe spleen is unique in respect to its development within the gut. While most of the gut organs are endodermally derived, the spleen is derived from mesenchymal tissue. Specifically, the spleen forms within, and from, the dorsal mesentery. However, it still shares the same blood supply\u2014the celiac trunk\u2014as the foregut organs.\nFunction.\nOther.\nOther functions of the spleen are less prominent, especially in the healthy adult:\nClinical significance.\nEnlarged spleen.\nEnlargement of the spleen is known as splenomegaly. It may be caused by sickle cell anemia, sarcoidosis, malaria, bacterial endocarditis, leukemia, polycythemia vera, pernicious anemia, Gaucher's disease, leishmaniasis, Hodgkin's disease, Banti's disease, hereditary spherocytosis, cysts, glandular fever (including mononucleosis or 'Mono' caused by the Epstein\u2013Barr virus and infection from cytomegalovirus), and tumours. Primary tumors of the spleen include hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas. Marked splenomegaly may result in the spleen occupying a large portion of the left side of the abdomen.\nThe spleen is the largest collection of lymphoid tissue in the body. It is normally palpable in preterm infants, in 30% of normal, full-term neonates, and in 5% to 10% of infants and toddlers. A spleen easily palpable below the costal margin in any child over the age of three to four years should be considered abnormal until proven otherwise.\nSplenomegaly can result from antigenic stimulation (e.g., infection), obstruction of blood flow (e.g., portal vein obstruction), underlying functional abnormality (e.g., hemolytic anemia), or infiltration (e.g., leukemia or storage disease, such as Gaucher's disease). The most common cause of acute splenomegaly in children is viral infection, which is transient and usually moderate. Basic work-up for acute splenomegaly includes a complete blood count with differential, platelet count, and reticulocyte and atypical lymphocyte counts to exclude hemolytic anemia and leukemia. Assessment of IgM antibodies to viral capsid antigen (a rising titer) is indicated to confirm Epstein\u2013Barr virus or cytomegalovirus. Other infections should be excluded if these tests are negative.\nCalculators have been developed for measurements of spleen size based on CT, US, and MRI findings.\nSplenic injury.\nTrauma, such as a road traffic collision, can cause rupture of the spleen, which is a situation requiring immediate medical attention.\nAsplenia.\nAsplenia refers to a non-functioning spleen, which may be congenital, or caused by traumatic injury, surgical resection (splenectomy) or a disease such as sickle cell anaemia. Hyposplenia refers to a partially functioning spleen. These conditions may cause a modest increase in circulating white blood cells and platelets, a diminished response to some vaccines, and an increased susceptibility to infection. In particular, there is an increased risk of sepsis from polysaccharide encapsulated bacteria. Encapsulated bacteria inhibit binding of complement or prevent complement assembled on the capsule from interacting with macrophage receptors. Phagocytosis needs natural antibodies, which are immunoglobulins that facilitate phagocytosis either directly or by complement deposition on the capsule. They are produced by IgM memory B cells (a subtype of B cells) in the marginal zone of the spleen.\nA splenectomy (removal of the spleen) results in a greatly diminished frequency of memory B cells. A 28-year follow-up of 740 World War II veterans whose spleens were removed on the battlefield showed a significant increase in the usual death rate from pneumonia (6 rather than the expected 1.3) and an increase in the death rate from ischemic heart disease (41 rather than the expected 30), but not from other conditions.\nAccessory spleen.\nAn accessory spleen is a small splenic nodule extra to the spleen usually formed in early embryogenesis. Accessory spleens are found in approximately 10 percent of the population and are typically around 1 centimeter in diameter. \"Splenosis\" is a condition where displaced pieces of splenic tissue (often following trauma or splenectomy) autotransplant in the abdominal cavity as accessory spleens.\nPolysplenia is a congenital disease manifested by multiple small accessory spleens, rather than a single, full-sized, normal spleen. Polysplenia sometimes occurs alone, but it is often accompanied by other developmental abnormalities such as intestinal malrotation or biliary atresia, or cardiac abnormalities, such as dextrocardia. These accessory spleens are non-functional.\nInfarction.\nSplenic infarction is a condition in which blood flow supply to the spleen is compromised, leading to partial or complete infarction (tissue death due to oxygen shortage) in the organ.\nSplenic infarction occurs when the splenic artery or one of its branches are occluded, for example by a blood clot. Although it can occur asymptomatically, the typical symptom is severe pain in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, sometimes radiating to the left shoulder. Fever and chills develop in some cases. It has to be differentiated from other causes of acute abdomen.\nHyaloserositis.\nThe spleen may be affected by hyaloserositis, in which it is coated with fibrous hyaline.\nSociety and culture.\nThere has been a long and varied history of misconceptions regarding the physiological role of the spleen, and it has often been seen as a reservoir for juices closely linked to digestion. In various cultures, the organ has been linked to melancholia, due to the influence of ancient Greek medicine and the associated doctrine of humourism, in which the spleen was believed to be a reservoir for an elusive fluid known as \"black bile\" (one of the four humours). The spleen also plays an important role in traditional Chinese medicine, where it is considered to be a key organ that displays the Yin aspect of the Earth element (its Yang counterpart is the stomach). In contrast, the Talmud (tractate Berachoth 61b) refers to the spleen as the organ of laughter while possibly suggesting a link with the humoral view of the organ.\nEtymologically, \"spleen\" comes from the Ancient Greek (\"spl\u1e17n\"), where it was the idiomatic equivalent of the heart in modern English. Persius, in his satires, associated \"spleen\" with immoderate laughter. The native Old English word for it is , now primarily used for animals; a loanword from Latin is .\nIn English, William Shakespeare frequently used the word \"spleen\" to signify melancholy, but also caprice and merriment. In \"Julius Caesar\", he uses the spleen to describe Cassius's irritable nature:\n&lt;poem&gt;Must I observe you? must I stand and crouch\nUnder your testy humour? By the gods\nYou shall digest the venom of your spleen,\nThough it do split you; for, from this day forth,\nI'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,\nWhen you are waspish.&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe spleen, as a byword for melancholy, has also been considered an actual disease. In the early 18th century, the physician Richard Blackmore considered it to be one of the two most prevalent diseases in England (along with consumption). In 1701, Anne Finch (later, Countess of Winchilsea) had published a Pindaric ode, \"The Spleen\", drawing on her first-hand experiences of an affliction which, at the time, also had a reputation of being a fashionably upper-class disease of the English. Both Blackmore and George Cheyne treated this malady as the male equivalent of \"the vapours\", while preferring the more learned terms \"hypochondriasis\" and \"hysteria\". In the late 18th century, the German word \"Spleen\" came to denote eccentric and hypochondriac tendencies that were thought to be characteristic of English people.\nIn French, \"spl\u00e9n\u00e9tique\" refers to a state of pensive sadness or melancholy. This usage was popularised by the poems of Charles Baudelaire (1821\u20131867) and his collection \"Le Spleen de Paris\", but it was also present in earlier 19th-century Romantic literature.\nFood.\nThe spleen is one of the many organs that may be included in offal. It is not widely eaten as a principal ingredient, but cow spleen sandwiches are eaten in Sicilian cuisine. Chicken spleen is one of the main ingredients of Jerusalem mixed grill.\nOther animals.\nIn cartilaginous and ray-finned fish, the spleen consists primarily of red pulp and is normally somewhat elongated, as it lies inside the serosal lining of the intestine. In many amphibians, especially frogs, it has the more rounded form and there is often a greater quantity of white pulp.\nIn reptiles, birds, and mammals, white pulp is always relatively plentiful, and in birds and some mammals the spleen is typically rounded, but it adjusts its shape somewhat to the arrangement of the surrounding organs. In most vertebrates, the spleen continues to produce red blood cells throughout life; only in mammals this function is lost in middle-aged adults. Many mammals have tiny spleen-like structures known as haemal nodes throughout the body that are presumed to have the same function as the spleen. The spleens of aquatic mammals differ in some ways from those of fully land-dwelling mammals; in general they are bluish in colour. In cetaceans and manatees, they tend to be quite small, but in deep diving pinnipeds, they can be massive, due to their function of storing red blood cells.\nMarsupials have y-shaped spleens, and it develops postnatally.\nThe only vertebrates lacking a spleen are the lampreys and hagfishes (the early-branching Cyclostomata, or jawless fishes). Even in these animals, there is a diffuse layer of haematopoeitic tissue within the gut wall, which has a similar structure to red pulp and is presumed homologous with the spleen of higher vertebrates.\nIn mice, the spleen stores half the body's monocytes so that, upon injury, they can migrate to the injured tissue and transform into dendritic cells and macrophages to assist wound healing.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Jordan died in 2007 while working on what was planned to be the twelfth and final volume in the series. He prepared extensive notes, enabling Sanderson to complete the final book, which grew into three volumes: \"The Gathering Storm\" (2009), \"Towers of Midnight\" (2010), and \"A Memory of Light\" (2013).\nThe series draws on numerous elements of both European and Asian mythologies, most notably the cyclical nature of time found in Buddhism and Hinduism; the metaphysical concepts of balance, duality and a respect for nature found in Taoism; and the dualistic concepts of God and Satan which is the foundation of Zoroastrianism.\n\"The Wheel of Time\" is known for its length, detailed imaginary world, magic system, and large cast of characters. The eighth through fourteenth books each reached number\u00a0one on the \"New York Times\" Best Seller list. After its completion, the series was nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Novel. As of 2021[ [update]], the series has sold over 90 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling epic fantasy series since \"The Lord of the Rings\".

A television adaptation, \"The Wheel of Time\", aired for three seasons on Amazon Prime Video, from 2021 to 2025.\nSetting.\nThe One Power and the Aes Sedai.\nThe series is set in the Third Age of a fantasy world in which the pattern of human existence is determined and maintained by the Wheel of Time, a cosmic embodiment of eternal return. The Wheel spins the Pattern of the Ages, manifest in both the physical world and human destiny, using the lives of men and women as its threads. Individuals with the power to influence and change the Pattern are called \"ta'veren\". The Wheel is rotated by a magical force called the One Power. The ability to access and wield the One Power is known as channeling, and only women can do this safely. Artifacts called \"angreal\" amplify the One Power, with \"sa'angreal\" being the most potent, and \"ter'angreal\" limited to specific functions.\nA matriarchal order called the Aes Sedai, made up of female channelers, are both respected and feared across the world. Their stated goal is to use their skills to serve and protect humanity, but they are also preparing for the inevitable, prophesized return of a malevolent entity they call the Dark One. The leader of the Aes Sedai, known as the Amyrlin Seat, rules from the White Tower in the city of Tar Valon. The order is divided into seven disciplines, or Ajahs: the Blue Ajah are dedicated to the pursuit of justice and inevitably intrigue, possessing extensive spy networks; the Brown Ajah are dedicated to the preservation of knowledge and history; the Gray Ajah are dedicated to mediation and politics; the Green Ajah are warriors trained in battle and strategy; the Red Ajah monitor the use of the One Power by outsiders; the White Ajah are concerned with logic and truth; the Yellow Ajah are mistresses of healing; and a secret eighth faction, the Black Ajah, pose as members of other Ajahs but serve the Dark One. The few men born with the ability to channel ultimately go mad, so the Red Ajah hunt male channelers and \"gentle\" them, or cut them off permanently from the One Power, ever aware of the danger they represent. With the exception of the Red Ajah, an Aes Sedai may choose to bond magically with a Warder, a male protector. The link bestows the Warder with heightened senses, strength, stamina and resistance to injury.\nGeography and cultures.\nThe primary continent depicted in the series consists of three regions: the Westlands, Shara far to the east, and the Aiel Waste in between. The Aiel Waste is separated from the Westlands by a vast mountain range known as the Spine of the World. Connecting these three areas in the north is the eastern part of the Great Blight, a once-verdant land mass that has been corrupted by the Dark One's influence. It stretches far west across the Aryth Ocean and borders the north of the continent of Seanchan. South of the Westlands is the Sea of Storms, and the small continent known as the Land of the Madmen. The Westlands contain 14 nations, including Andor, Cairhien, Illian, Shienar and Tear, as well as four major city-states: Falme, Far Madding, Mayene and Tar Valon. Other notable cities include Caemlyn, the capital of Andor, and Fal Dara, the northernmost city in Shienar. Two Rivers is a region in Andor which includes the village Emond's Field, home of five of the series' main characters. Shara, which extends much further south than either the Westlands or the Aiel Waste, is separated from the rest of the continent by the Cliffs of the Dawn and the Great Rift. Shara remains mysterious to outsiders, who are only allowed to enter walled-off towns to trade. The world in which the series is set is sometimes called \"Randland\" by fans, referring to lead character Rand al'Thor.\nThe &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Seanchan are a vast and powerful empire whose civilization has developed at a distance from the primary continent of the series. Their culture enslaves female channelers, who they believe are too dangerous to be free. Such channelers, known as \"damane\", are collared with a \"ter'angreal\" called an \"a'dam\", which allows women known as \"sul'dam\" to harness and control their channeling power. As the Seanchan invade, they use the \"a'dam\" to enslave any Aes Sedai they can. Also opposing the Aes Sedai are the Children of the Light, or Whitecloaks, a quasi-religious, militarized order bent on destroying anyone who channels the One Power, believing they are servants of the Shadow. In Shara, channelers are known as Ayyad, and isolate themselves in special communities. The females, who secretly control the monarchy, cultivate a bloodline of channelers by using male Ayyad as uneducated breeding stock and executing them by age 21.\nThe &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Aiel are a fierce warrior race who live in the Three-fold Land, called the Aiel Waste by outsiders, an inhospitable desert region located between the Westlands and Shara. They are tall, with characteristic pale eyes, and red or blond hair. There are 12 Aiel clans, plus the extinct Jenn Aiel, who built the city of Rhuidean, a repository of Aiel history and culture. The Maidens of the Spear are an all-female warrior society among the Aiel. Female Aiel who can channel the One Power or navigate \"Tel'aran'rhiod\", the World of Dreams, do not join the Aes Sedai, instead becoming known as Wise Ones. The Aiel await a prophesied \"Chief of Chiefs\", whom they call the \"Car'a'carn\", who will unite and rule all the clans.\nThe &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Ogier are a hirsute, wide-featured and immensely tall and strong species of humanoid known for their proficiency in woodwork and masonry. Though physically intimidating, they are peaceful, intelligent and interested in historical and genealogical study. The Ogier also possess a unique ability called treesinging, whereby they stimulate the growth and healing of trees and plants by singing to them. They live in sanctuaries called \"steddings\", in which the One Power is inaccessible. After the Breaking of the World, male channelers who sought sanctuary with the Ogier thanked them by creating the Ways, a series of paths through an alternate dimension that connected Ogier communities. Stone doorways called Waygates, placed outside each \"stedding\", were used to travel long distances quickly. In the millennia that followed, however, the Ways were corrupted by a malevolent force known as the Machin Shin, or Black Wind, which attacks travelers.\nThe &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Tinkers, or \"Tuatha'an\", are a nomadic group of people who travel continuously and widely in brightly colored wagons, believing this is the only way to remain safe. They follow the pacifistic Way of the Leaf, which eschews violence. The Tuatha'an's main purpose has evolved to searching for \"The Song\", lost during the Breaking of the World, which they claim they will know when they find it. The Sea Folk, or \"Atha'an Miere\", are dark-skinned people with complex customs who live on ships and on islands in the Sea of Storms. They only appear on the mainland to trade goods, and Sea Folk porcelain sculptures, delicate and graceful objects of art, are highly prized by mainlanders. Unknown to any but the \"Atha'an Miere\", the fabled porcelain is created by the Amayar, a group of island dwelling people protected by the Sea Folk as a solemn duty since the Breaking of the World. The Amayar adhere to the Water Way, a pacifistic way of life akin to the Way of the Leaf practiced by the Tuatha'an.\nThe Dark One.\nHumans seduced by promises of power and immortality to serve the Dark One are known as Darkfriends. The increasing influence of the Dark One has also introduced an array of creatures called Shadowspawn. Trollocs are brutal, humanoid monsters with animal senses who kill with pleasure and eat all meat, including humans. They are led by the Myrddraal, or Fades, terrifying and deadly creatures without eyes who can disappear in shadow but will not cross running water. Appearing human and designed to target channelers, \"gholam\" are constructs which possess superhuman strength, are impervious to harm and immune to the One Power, and feed on blood. Gray Men, or the Soulless, are humans who have sacrificed their souls to become drab assassins with the ability to pass completely unnoticed. Draghkar are flying, vampiric creatures that devour the souls of their prey. Darkhounds are otherworldly, doglike beasts the size of small horses, with acidic, poison saliva. They regenerate when wounded or dismembered, and can only be destroyed by balefire, a weapon of the One Power which erases the target from existence, retroactively through time.\nThe most significant minions of the Shadow are the Forsaken, a group of male and female channelers from the Second Age, or the Age of Legends, who are among the most powerful to have ever lived. Calling themselves \"Those Chosen to Rule the World Forever\", they pledged their loyalty to the Dark One in exchange for power and immortality. In turn, the Dark One granted them access to the True Power, his exclusive equivalent of the One Power which is not divided by gender, and is more chaotic. Use of the True Power manifests as \"saa\", black flecks moving across the eyes of the channeler, increasing in number in tandem with increased channeling. The more powerful among the Forsaken vie to be raised above the others to the position of \"nae'blis\", the Dark One's second-in-command. The thirteen Forsaken\u2014Aginor, Asmodean, Balthamel, Be'lal, Demandred, Graendal, Ishamael, Lanfear, Mesaana, Moghedien, Rahvin, Sammael and Semirhage\u2014were imprisoned with the Dark One at Shayol Ghul at the end of the Second Age. Three thousand years later near the end of the Third Age, the Aes Sedai learn that the prophesied channeler known as the Dragon has been reborn, signaling that a final battle with the Dark One is coming. The Seven Seals of the Dark One's prison have weakened, and the Forsaken begin to reenter the world, presenting a new threat and paving the way for their master.\nBackstory.\nIn the backstory of the series, the Wheel of Time and the universe were forged at the dawn of time by a deity known as the Creator, simultaneously imprisoning its antithesis, the Dark One. The One Power itself is divided into both male (\"saidin\") and female (\"saidar\") halves, and originally both genders could wield it. In the Age of Legends, the Aes Sedai was made up of both men and women who could channel. An Aes Sedai experiment inadvertently drilled what would become known as the Bore into the Dark One's prison, and his influence began to seep out into the world. In response to the threat of his eventual release, the Wheel produced the Dragon, Lews Therin Telamon, a channeler of immense power. Lews eventually rose to command the Aes Sedai and their allies in the struggle against the Dark One's forces. Seven Seals were created, made of an unbreakable substance called \"cuendillar\", to be used as focus points to reseal the Dark One's prison for good. Lews and a host of 113 male channelers managed to imprison the Forsaken with their master, but at the moment of victory, the Dark One was able to taint \"saidin\", driving male channelers insane. Lews killed his friends and family, and then himself. Other male channelers devastated the world with earthquakes and tidal waves, an event called the Breaking of the World, before destroying themselves. The female Aes Sedai guided humanity out of this dark time, living in the shadow of a prophecy that the Dark One would break free from his prison and the Dragon would be reborn to fight him once more. And though the Dragon Reborn is humanity's only hope against the Dark One, he would break the world a second time in the process.\nPlot.\nIn \"The Eye of the World\" (1990), the arrival of a mysterious noblewoman to the remote village of Emond's Field in the Two Rivers precedes an attack on the town by a force of humanoid monsters called Trollocs. The woman reveals herself to be Moiraine Damodred, one of the Aes Sedai, and warns that the servants of the Dark One are seeking one of three young men from the village: Rand al'Thor, Perrin Aybara and Matrim Cauthon. They leave with Moiraine and her companion, the Warder Lan Mandragoran, and are joined by Egwene al'Vere, in whom Moiraine sees a potential Aes Sedai; the gleeman Thom Merrilin; and later the Wisdom Nynaeve al'Meara, a healer who learns she can also channel the One Power. They are pursued by increasing numbers of Trollocs, led by deadly, eyeless Fades, and are separated fleeing the cursed, abandoned city of Shadar Logoth. At the Eye of the World, a sacred pool of untainted \"saidin\", Rand's defeat of the Forsaken Aginor and Ba'alzamon convinces Moiraine that he is the prophesied Dragon Reborn.\nFrom then, the story expands and protagonist Rand, as well as the other characters, are frequently split into different groups, pursuing different missions or agendas aimed at furthering the cause of the Dragon Reborn, sometimes thousands of miles apart. Broadly speaking, the original group of characters from the Two Rivers make new allies, gain experience, and become figures of some influence and authority. As they struggle to unite the western kingdoms against the Dark One's forces, their task is complicated by rulers of the nations who refuse to give up their authority and by factions such as the Children of the Light, who do not believe in the prophecies, and the Seanchan, the people of a long-lost colony of Artur Hawkwing's empire across the western ocean who have returned, believing it is their destiny to conquer the world. The Aes Sedai also become divided between those who believe the Dragon Reborn should be strictly controlled and those who believe he must lead them into battle as he did in the earlier war. As the story expands, new characters representing different factions are introduced; although this expansion of the narrative allows the sheer scale of the growing struggle to be effectively depicted, it has been criticized for slowing the pace of the novels and sometimes reducing the appearances of the original or main cast to extended cameos.\nBy the sixth novel, \"Lord of Chaos\" (1994), it has become clear that the Last Battle, triggered when the Dark One is able to exert its influence directly on the world once more, is imminent, as only three Seals (keys to the Dark One's prison) are intact. Once the remaining Seals break, the Dark One will be free to touch the world. The Last Battle, \"Tarmon Gai'don\", is depicted in the fourteenth and final novel in the series, \"A Memory of Light\" (2013).\nNovels.\nIn 2002, \"The Eye of the World\" was repackaged as two volumes with new illustrations for younger readers: \"From the Two Rivers\", including an extra chapter (\"Ravens\") before the existing prologue; and \"To the Blight\" with an expanded glossary. In 2004, the same was done with \"The Great Hunt\", with the two parts being \"The Hunt Begins\" and \"New Threads in the Pattern\".\nDevelopment.\nWriting and conception.\nJordan started writing \"The Eye of the World\" in 1984 and did not finish it until late 1988 or early 1989, with characters and storylines changing considerably during the writing process. One early version of the story centered on an older man who discovered relatively late in life that he was the 'chosen one' who had to save the world. However, Jordan deliberately decided to move closer to the tone and style of J. R. R. Tolkien's \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" and made the characters younger and less experienced. Once this decision had been made, writing proceeded much more easily and Jordan completed the second volume, \"The Great Hunt\", at roughly the same time the first book was published. According to fantasy author Brandon Sanderson, Jordan originally planned the series as a trilogy.\nJordan wrote full-time at breakneck speed for the next several years until he completed the seventh volume, \"A Crown of Swords\", at which point he slowed down, delivering a book every two years. Fans objected when he took some time off to expand a short story into a prequel novel called \"New Spring\", so he decided to shelve his plans for additional prequels in favor of finishing off the last two volumes in the series. He rejected criticisms of the later volumes of the series slowing down in pace in order to concentrate on minor secondary characters at the expense of the main characters from the opening volumes but acknowledged that his structure for the tenth volume, \"Crossroads of Twilight\" (where he showed a major scene from the prior book, \"Winter's Heart\", from the perspective of the main characters that were not involved in the scene), had not worked out as he had planned. \"Knife of Dreams\", the eleventh volume, had a much more positive reception from critics and fans alike and Jordan announced the twelfth volume, which he had previously announced would have the working title \"A Memory of Light\", would conclude the series. According to \"Forbes\", Jordan had intended for it to be the final book \"even if it reaches 2,000 pages.\"\nJordan's death and completion by Sanderson.\nJordan was diagnosed with the terminal heart disease primary amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy in December 2005, and while he intended to finish at least \"A Memory of Light\" even if the \"worse comes to worst\", he made preparations in case he was not able to complete the book: \"I'm getting out notes, so if the worst actually happens, someone could finish \"A Memory of Light\" and have it end the way I want it to end.\"\nWith Jordan's death on 16 September 2007, the conclusion of the series was in question. On 7 December of that year, the publisher Tor Books announced that Sanderson was to finish \"A Memory of Light\". Sanderson, a longtime fan of the series, was chosen by Jordan's widow Harriet McDougal partly because she liked Sanderson's novels and partly because of a eulogy he had written for Jordan. Jordan had prepared extensive notes, which enabled Sanderson to complete the final book.\nOn 30 March 2009, Tor Books announced that \"A Memory of Light\" would be split into three volumes, with Brandon Sanderson citing timing and continuity reasons. By his estimate in early 2009, the book would have taken several years to write and would have reached 800,000 words. McDougal doubted that Jordan could have concluded it in a single volume. The three volumes were published from 2009 to 2013, as \"The Gathering Storm\", \"Towers of Midnight\", and \"A Memory of Light\", with the last book using Jordan's title.\nAfter \"A Memory of Light\".\nPrior to his death, Jordan had often discussed adding an additional two prequels and an 'outrigger' sequel trilogy. In a Q&amp;A following the release of \"A Memory of Light\", Sanderson ruled out the completion of these works; Jordan had left very little in the way of notes for these additional novels \u2013 only two sentences in the case of the sequel trilogy. Sanderson addressed the subject again in a 2023 blog post, and stated that writing additional \"Wheel of Time\" works would have gone against the wishes of Robert Jordan.\nTwo cut portions of \"A Memory of Light\" were released as short stories in the years following the release of the main book. These were published in \"Unfettered\" anthologies, part of a charitable endeavour to support authors and artists with medical debt. \"River of Souls\", a canonical segment removed from the published book due to pacing, was released in the first volume in 2013. \"A Fire in the Ways\", a non-canon alternate sequence of events around the climax of the final book, was included in the third volume in 2019. A glossary to the series, \"The Wheel of Time Companion\", was released in 2015.\nThemes and influences.\n\"The Wheel of Time\" is a novel from the modern fantasy genre, specifically high fantasy. The book is set in a world that is simultaneously the distant past and distant future of the real world, as a result of time being cyclical rather than linear. The opening of the first book establishes the concept:\n The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again. In one Age, called the Third Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past, a wind rose...\nJordan acknowledged the influence of J. R. R. Tolkien, including deliberately modelling the setting of the first chapters on the Shire in \"The Lord of the Rings\". Concepts drawn from monotheistic religions include the duality between good and evil and between \"Creator\" (Light) and Shai'tan, \"The Dark One\" (Shaitan is an Arabic word that, in Islamic contexts, is used as a name for the Devil or Satan). Other influences include Arthurian legends, Norse mythology and Irish mythology, as well as real life history. In addition, Jordan also drew influences from Eastern mythology, which was rare for a Western fantasy series. The concept of a wheel of time was drawn from Hinduism. Versions of the concept include the \"Yuga\" cycle in Hinduism and \"Kalachakra\" in Buddhism. The series was also influenced by the concepts of reincarnation and balance, and the symbol of the Aes Sedai resembles the yin and yang. The series also draws inspiration from Leo Tolstoy's \"War and Peace\".\nFate is an important theme to the series. The series explores in great detail the implications of a common fantasy premise, in which an ordinary boy on the verge of adulthood discovers he is fated to lead a major struggle. It also deals with the divide between fate and free will. Some major characters are \"ta'veren\", who have exceptional abilities to influence the course of history in a tumultuous period, but even they can only go so far as permitted by \"The Pattern\" that is being set by the Wheel of Time.\nThe series also featured alternative portrayals of the role of gender in society. The nature of magic in its world means that only women can safely use it. This disparity influences the power dynamics at multiple levels of its societies, including familial, communal and political levels; many of its societies are ruled by women.\nDerivative works.\nShort stories.\nJordan wrote two short stories within the franchise in the late 1990s. The first, \"The Strike at Shayol Ghul\", predates the main series by several thousand years. It was made available on the Internet and was later published in \"The World of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time\". Jordan also wrote a short story entitled \"New Spring\", for the 1998 anthology \"Legends\" edited by Robert Silverberg. Jordan later expanded this into the stand-alone novel \"New Spring\" that was published in January 2004.\nDuring Brandon Sanderson's work on \"A Memory of Light\", two sections of the book were cut and later published as short stories in anthologies. The first, \"River of Souls\", was published in \"Unfettered: Tales by Masters of Fantasy\" (2013). The second, \"A Fire Within the Ways\" was published in \"Unfettered III\" in 2019. Unlike \"River of Souls\", \"A Fire Within the Ways\" is not considered canon.\nCompanion books.\nIn November 1997, Tor Books published a companion book to the series, entitled \"The World of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time\", which contains much hitherto unrevealed background information about the series including the first maps of the entire world and the Seanchan home continent. Jordan co-authored the book with Teresa Patterson. Jordan ruled the book broadly canonical but stated that it was written from the perspective of an historian within \"The Wheel of Time\" universe and was prone to errors of bias and guesswork.\nOn November 3, 2015, Tor published \"The Wheel of Time Companion: The People, Places, and History of the Bestselling Series\" was released in hardback format, written by Harriet McDougal, Alan Romanczuk, and Maria Simons. Alan Romanczuk and Maria Simons were Robert Jordan's editorial assistants. The book is an encapsulating glossary of the entire series. The authors began compiling material for the volume as early as 2005, and the final book was released after the series' conclusion.\nOn November 8, 2022, Tor published \"Origins of the Wheel of Time: The Legends and Mythologies that Inspired Robert Jordan\" , written by Michael Livingston. The book contains a brief biography of Robert Jordan and gives an account of how he came to write \"The Wheel of Time\". It analyzes Jordan's influences, and how the real world and works of literature influenced or were referenced by the novels. In particular, it outlines the influences of \"Le Morte d'Arthur by Sir Thomas Malory, J. R. R. Tolkien's \"Legendarium, and \"The White Goddess\" by Robert Graves. One section lists various references to the real world contained within \"The Wheel of Time\", both confirmed and speculated. The book also contains a foreword written by Harriet McDougal Rigney (Jordan's widow and editor), a few excerpts from early drafts of the texts, a deleted scene from \"The Eye of the World\", and a revised map of the world based on Jordan's feedback on the map included in \"The World of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time\". Many references are given linking assertions in the book to the collection of Jordan's personal notes contained at The Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina.\nComic books.\nIn 2004, Jordan sold the film, television, video game, and comic rights to the series to production company Red Eagle Entertainment. Dabel Brothers began adapting the series in comic book form, starting with the prequel \"New Spring\" in July 2005. The series initially ran on a monthly schedule, but then went on a three-year hiatus after the fifth issue. Red Eagle cited delays and changes to the creative team on the DB Pro end. The final three issues were ultimately completed and published in 2009\u201310.\nIn 2009 Dabel moved on to their adaptation of the first book of the series proper, \"The Eye of the World\". On 17 March 2009, they showcased ten pages of art from the prelude to the series \"The Wheel of Time: Eye of the World #0 \u2013 Dragonmount\" on their website. Dynamite Entertainment published 35 issues of \"Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time: The Eye of the World\" comic book series, which concluded in March 2013.\nWhen asked in a 2013 interview about whether the comics would continue their run, Harriet McDougal replied \"Well, eventually, [we'll] do the whole thing, unless it stops selling in a dreadful way. In other words, I don't really know.\" The 43 \"New Spring\" and \"Eye of the World\" comics were later collected together and released as a series of six graphic novels, the last of which was released in February 2015.\nDynamite began publishing the comic adaptation \"Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time: The Great Hunt\" in November 2023.\nGames.\nThere is a \"Wheel of Time\" MUD, identified as such or by the initialism \"https://\", which is based on a world like that of the Wheel of Time but set in a time frame around 30 world years prior. It has been in operation almost continuously since 1993. Notably, the \"WoTMUD\" had gained written permission from the author to use his creation including all but major characters.\nA computer game named \"The Wheel of Time\" was released in 1999. Over the course of the game, Aes Sedai must track down a robber following an assault on the White Tower, and prevent the Dark One from being released prematurely. She eventually learns of and executes a long-forgotten ritual at Shayol Ghul to ensure the Dark Lord remains sealed within the prison. While Jordan was consulted in the creation of the game, he did not write the storyline himself.\nStarting in 1999, Precedence Entertainment released three sets of \"The Wheel of Time Collectible Card Game\".\n\"The Wheel of Time Roleplaying Game\" was released in 2001 from Wizards of the Coast using the d20 rules developed for the third edition of the \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" game. The game had a single adventure module published in 2002, \"Prophecies of the Dragon\". Shortly after the release of the adventure book Wizards of the Coast announced they would not be releasing any further products for the game. Robert Jordan cited some problems with the roleplaying game, such as storyline details in the adventure module that contradicted the books.\nIn early 2009 EA Games announced that they had bought the rights for a MMORPG, with the plan to publish it through the EA Partners-Program. The following year Obsidian Entertainment announced that they would be working on the project, for a PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC release. However, the project was seemingly dropped around 2014.\nTelevision and film.\nEarly attempts.\nIn a 2000 chat on CNN.com, Robert Jordan mentioned that NBC had purchased an option to do a miniseries of \"The Eye of the World\". But he expressed doubts that the series would be made stating \"key people involved in getting that contract together have left NBC.\" The series was optioned by Universal Pictures in 2008 for film adaptations, with plans to adapt \"The Eye of the World\" as the first film. Neither project ultimately emerged.\nIn February 2015, Red Eagle Entertainment paid air time to cable network FXX to air \"Winter Dragon\", a low-budget 22-minute pilot for a potential \"The Wheel of Time\" series that allowed Red Eagle to hold on to the rights to the series. The pilot, based on the prologue to \"The Eye of the World\", starred Max Ryan as Lews Therin Thelamon and Billy Zane as Ishamael and aired after midnight with no announcements or publicity. Harriet McDougal initially stated she was unaware of the show ahead of time, and that the film rights to \"The Wheel of Time\" were set to revert to the Bandersnatch Group, her company, a few days later on 11 February 2015. Her comments triggered a slander lawsuit with Red Eagle, which was ultimately dismissed during settlement talks that July. In an interview with \"io9\", Red Eagle Entertainment's CEO Rick Selvage stated \"it was more of an [issue of] getting it on the air.\" A spokesman for FXX stated that the channel was paid to air the show, but Selvage hinted that it was indeed produced with a future series in mind. \"We think there's huge demand for the television series internationally, and we're looking forward to producing it and getting it out in the marketplace.\" On 29 April 2016, Harriet McDougal confirmed that the legal issues had been resolved and that a television series was in development.\nAmazon Prime Video series.\nA new adaptation of the series was announced on 20 April 2017, produced by Sony Pictures Television in association with Red Eagle Entertainment and Radar Pictures, with Rafe Judkins as showrunner and executive producer. In February 2018, Amazon Studios announced a deal with Sony Pictures Television to co-develop the series for distribution on its streaming service Amazon Prime Video. The series was formally greenlit in October 2018. Principal photography for the first season began on 16 September 2019, was halted in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but had resumed by April 2021 and concluded in May 2021. On 20 May 2021, Amazon renewed the series for a second season ahead of the series premiere. \"The Wheel of Time\" premiered on 19 November 2021. Filming for the second season began on 19 July 2021, and concluded in February 2022. On 21 July 2022, ahead of the second-season premiere, Amazon renewed the series for a third season. The second season premiered on 1 September 2023, and combined elements from both \"The Great Hunt\" (1990) and \"The Dragon Reborn\" (1991), the second and third books in the series. The third season premiered on 13 March 2025 and combined elements of the third and fourth books, \"The Dragon Reborn\" (1991) and \"The Shadow Rising\" (1992). On May 23, 2025, Amazon canceled the series after three seasons.\nReception.\nThe eighth through fourteenth novels in the series each reached number\u00a0one on the \"New York Times\" Best Seller list. After its completion, the series was nominated for a Hugo Award. As of 2021[ [update]], the series has sold over 90 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling epic fantasy series since \"The Lord of the Rings\".\nFan culture.\nMany fans of \"The Wheel of Time\" attend Dragon Con, which had an exclusive \"Wheel of Time\" content track from 2001 through 2012. \"The Wheel of Time\" now has its own annual convention, JordanCon, which has been held annually in Atlanta, Georgia, since 2009. The 2020 convention was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, it took place over the Internet, some aspects being held through the use of the Zoom platform. The 2023 convention in April was the 15th anniversary of the founding of JordanCon.\nA new convention titled \"WoT\"Con took place from 8\u201310 July 2022, in Dublin, OH. This convention was created to be dedicated to the world of \"The Wheel of Time\" in all media aspects: novels, social media, and the television series. The second convention took place 14\u201316 July 2023.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The original unabridged audiobook is narrated by Michael Kramer and Kate Reading, with a later unabridged edition read by Rosamund Pike. The initial publication of \"The Eye of the World\" included a prologue and 53 chapters, with a subsequent re-release featuring an additional prologue titled \"Ravens\".\nThe book achieved both critical and commercial success. Critics lauded its tone and themes, while its similarities to \"The Lord of the Rings\" received both praise and criticism.\nOn January 2, 2002, \"The Eye of the World\" was re-released as two separate books, \"From the Two Rivers\" and \"To the Blight\", targeting the young adult market with larger text and illustrations. \"From the Two Rivers\" included an additional prologue, \"Ravens,\" focusing on Egwene al'Vere. The American Library Association included \"The Eye of the World\" on its 2003 list of Popular Paperbacks for Young Adults.\nFollowing the release of the \"The Wheel of Time\" television series, \"The Eye of the World\" appeared on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list in January 2022 in the mass market category and reached number one on the audio fiction list.\nPlot.\nIn the remote village of Emond's Field in the Two Rivers, the arrival of a mysterious noblewoman precedes an attack by Trollocs, humanoid monsters. The woman identifies herself as Moiraine Damodred, an Aes Sedai, and warns that servants of the Dark One seek one of three young men: Rand al'Thor, Perrin Aybara and Matrim Cauthon. They depart with Moiraine and her Warder, Lan Mandragoran, joined by Egwene al'Vere, whom Moiraine believes has Aes Sedai potential; the gleeman Thom Merrilin; and later the Wisdom Nynaeve al'Meara, a healer who discovers her ability to channel the One Power. Pursued by Trollocs, they seek refuge in the abandoned city of Shadar Logoth, where Mat steals a cursed dagger, becoming infected by the malevolent Mashadar.\nEscaping the city, the travelers are separated. Rand, Mat, and Thom travel by boat to Whitebridge, where Thom is lost, allowing Rand and Mat to escape a Myrddraal, the eyeless creatures leading the Trollocs. In Caemlyn, Rand befriends an Ogier named Loial. Attempting to see the captured False Dragon, Rand meets Elayne Trakand, heir to Andor, and her brothers Gawyn Trakand and Galad Damodred. Rand is brought before Queen Morgase; her Aes Sedai advisor, Elaida; and Gareth Bryne, Captain-General of the Queen's Guard, and released, despite Elaida's warnings.\nEgwene and Perrin are separately guided to Caemlyn by Elyas Machera, who communicates telepathically with wolves and claims Perrin shares this ability. They encounter the Tuatha'an, or Tinkers, and Aram, who expresses interest in Egwene and explains their belief in non-violence, The Way of the Leaf. The three encounter the Children of the Light, where Perrin kills two for killing a wolf and is sentenced to death. Moiraine, Lan, and Nynaeve rescue Egwene and Perrin, reuniting them with Rand and Mat. Moiraine decides Mat must go to Tar Valon to overcome Shadar Logoth's influence.\nLoial warns Moiraine of a threat to the Eye of the World, a pool of Saidin untouched by the Dark One's influence, confirmed by dreams Mat, Rand, and Perrin have. The Eye of the World is protected by Someshta (the Green Man) and contains a seal on the Dark One's prison, the Dragon banner of Lews Therin Telamon, and the Horn of Valere. At the border of the civilized world, the group enters the Blight to protect the Eye. They meet the Green Man, who reveals the Eye, and are confronted by the Forsaken Aginor and Balthamel. Balthamel and the Green Man kill each other. Rand defeats Aginor and uses the Eye to decimate the Trolloc army and defeat Ba'alzamon. Moiraine concludes Rand is the Dragon Reborn, but withholds details of the final battle from the male members of the group except Lan.\nTwo Rivers characters.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Plainlist/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThemes and allusions.\nRobert Jordan stated that he consciously intended the early chapters of \"The Eye of the World\" to evoke the Shire of Middle-earth in J. R. R. Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\". Despite their similarities, the two works differ in themes. Jordan and Tolkien created narratives that explored power, but \"The Eye of the World\" discussed how power can be deployed, whereas \"The Lord of the Rings\" focused more on its renunciation. Rand needed to wield his power to fight a war with the Dark One, a theme antithetical to Frodo's quest to destroy the ring of Sauron, a source of immense power that corrupted its wearer.\nReception.\nPBS's The Great American Read named \"The Eye of the World\" \"one of America's best-loved novels,\" ranking it #62 on their top 100 list.\nRelease details.\nDivided printing.\nIn January 2002, Starscape Books released \"The Eye of the World\" in two volumes: \"From the Two Rivers\" () and \"To the Blight\" ().

It was published by Tor Books and released on November 15, 1990. \"The Great Hunt\" consists of a prologue and 50 chapters. In 2004 \"The Great Hunt\" was re-released as two separate books, \"The Hunt Begins\" and \"New Threads in the Pattern\".\nThe story features young heroes Rand al'Thor, Mat Cauthon, and Perrin Aybara, who join Shienaren soldiers in a quest to retrieve the Horn of Valere. At the same time, Egwene al'Vere, Nynaeve al'Meara, and Elayne Trakand go to the White Tower in Tar Valon to learn Aes Sedai ways. Finally, an exotic army invades the western coast.\nPlot summary.\nPrologue.\nBa'alzamon presides over a clandestine meeting. In addition to Forsaken and Darkfriends, Ba'alzamon's known subordinates, the meeting includes two Aes Sedai and a Questioner of the Children of the Light. In this meeting, Rand al'Thor, Mat Cauthon, and Perrin Aybara are all mentioned.\nThe Hunt Begins.\nAt Fal Dara in Shienar, following the events in \"The Eye of the World\", Lan Mandragoran instructs Rand in sword fighting. Mat Cauthon's condition worsens through his psychic attachment to a parasitic dagger from Shadar Logoth. Padan Fain, the Darkfriend, is imprisoned. The Amyrlin Seat, Siuan Sanche, arrives, and identifies Rand al'Thor as the Dragon Reborn. At the same time, through their private conversations it is revealed that the Amyrlin Seat and Moiraine Damodred have a secret plan for the Dragon Reborn and have been close friends for many years. Fain is subsequently freed by Darkforces who invade the castle in Fal Dara, stealing the Horn of Valere and the tainted dagger.\nRand, Perrin Aybara, and Mat accompany a Shienaran party southbound in pursuit, under the leadership of Lord Ingtar Shinowa and guided by a tracker named Hurin who can literally smell past violence. The Amyrlin departs for Tar Valon, taking Nynaeve al'Meara and Egwene al'Vere for Aes Sedai training. Moirane breaks off, unbidden, to seek answers. In Tar Valon, Nynaeve and Egwene befriend daughter-heir Elayne Trakand and the clairvoyant Min Farshaw. Nynaeve passes the test to become Accepted, a rank in the White Tower below Aes Sedai and above Novice.\nRand, the Ogier Loial, and Hurin sleep near a stone. They wake up, separated from the Shienaran party, and transported to an alternative world similar to their own, but deserted and distorted. Rand suspects that he activated the stone by unconsciously channeling \"saidin\" in his sleep. (Rand's struggle to accept his channeling ability is a recurring element in the novel.) However, Egwene dreams of a woman standing over Rand while he slept, whose \"eyes seemed to shine like the moon\".\nIn this alternative world, Rand comes across a beautiful woman who is fighting off a creature unlike he's ever seen, but he ends up killing it. She says her name is Selene, she is from Cairhien and appears to be a lady or even royalty. She says she also came to the strange world while sleeping and knows how to get back. One night, Rand meets Ba'alzamon in a dream and has a heron's image (the crest of his sword) branded into his palm in a fight. Selene explains how they can return by a different portal stone to their own world, ahead of Fain's and Ingtar's groups. When Fain does arrive, Rand and Loial sneak into his camp and retrieve the Horn and dagger. Still behind, and at a loss to explain Rand's disappearance, Lord Ingtar's group pursue Fain with the aid of Perrin, who uses his telepathic ability to communicate with wolves, which in turn can track Fain's Trollocs (the Dark One's bestial foot-soldiers).\nRand's party journeys to Cairhien, where Rand finds gleeman Thom Merrilin, whom he thought dead after the events in \"The Eye of the World\". Rand and Loial are attacked by Trollocs and, during their escape, damage the Chapter House of the Illuminator's Guild, a society retaining knowledge of fireworks.\nRand receives unwanted, high-profile invitations from House Damodred and from the King. Hurin is attacked at the inn by Fain's forces, and the Horn and dagger are stolen once more. Ingtar's group arrives in Cairhien. Hurin traces the Darkfriends to Barthanes Damodred's manor. Using the now-valuable invitation, the path is traced further to a Waygate in the premises. However, they are prevented from pursuit by Machin Shin. Via Barthanes, Padan Fain tells them that he is taking the Horn to the port city of Falme in Toman Head. Thom's apprentice Dena is murdered for Thom's involvement with Rand.\nTo Toman Head.\nThe invading Seanchan and their exotic beasts have occupied Falme. Fain gives the Horn to High Lord Turak of the Seanchan. Geofram Bornhald, leader of the zealous religious group Children of the Light, also known as the Whitecloaks, is preparing to attack the Seanchan.\nIngtar's group tries a different Waygate in a nearby Ogier stedding, but they find Machin Shin there too. Rand takes them via a portal stone instead, but they lose months of time. At the White Tower, Liandrin Guirale lures Egwene and Nynaeve, along with an accompanying Elayne and Min, to Toman Head via the Ways, handing them over to the Seanchan. Egwene is collared with an \"a'dam\", a device used by the Seanchan to control channelers, while Min is held hostage. Nynaeve and Elayne escape.\nElayne and Nynaeve rescue Egwene from the Seanchan and attempt to flee the city. Meanwhile, Ingtar, Rand, Hurin, Mat, and Perrin enter Falme and retrieve the Horn and dagger, during which Rand slays Turak. Ingtar reveals himself as a Darkfriend, but redeems himself when he dies fighting. However, the Whitecloaks attack the Seanchan, leaving Rand's group trapped perilously between the advancing lines. Mat blows the Horn of Valere, summoning dead heroes, including Artur Hawkwing. The banner of the Dragon Reborn is unfurled, and they ride to battle against the Seanchan.\nBa'alzamon appears, and he and Rand fight, the duel projected into the air above Falme. Rand allows himself to be stabbed with Ba'alzamon's staff, giving him an opening to stab Ba'alzamon through the heart with his heron-mark sword.\nWith the battle over and the Seanchan defeated, Rand is found by Min and hauled into a bed to recuperate. Selene arrives, touches the sleeping Rand, reveals herself to be the Forsaken Lanfear, and disappears. When Rand awakens, he finds Ingtar's army under the dragon's banner, and they offer their pledge to him."}

Upon its release, it immediately rose to the #1 position on the \"New York Times\" hardcover fiction bestseller list, making it the second \"Wheel of Time\" book to reach the #1 position on that list. It remained on the list for the next two months. \"Winter's Heart\" consists of a prologue and 35 chapters.\nThe book's title is a reference to the increasing coldness of Rand al'Thor's personality and to the return of winter following the reversal in the previous book, \"The Path of Daggers\", of the unnatural heat caused by the Dark One's manipulation of the climate.\n\"Winter's Heart\" was the first \"Wheel of Time\" book for which the prologue, entitled \"Snow\", was first sold as an ebook in advance of the physical release of the book. \"Snow\" was released by the Scribner imprint of Simon &amp; Schuster in September 2000, two months before the publication of \"Winter's Heart\".\nPlot summary.\nMany of the events of \"Winter's Heart\" take place simultaneously with the events of the next book, \"Crossroads of Twilight\". Perrin Aybara and his followers pursue the Shaido Aiel who kidnapped his wife, Faile Bashere, while Elayne Trakand attempts to suppress rebellious nobles.\nMat Cauthon is trapped in the city of Ebou Dar in Altara, under Seanchan occupation.

There, defended by Cadsuane Melaidhrin's Aes Sedai and loyal Asha'man against the Forsaken, Rand and Nynaeve use the Choedan Kal, two giant \"sa'angreal\", to cleanse \"saidin\" of the Dark One's influence. In the process, Shadar Logoth, the access key to the female Choedan Kal, and the female Choedan Kal itself are destroyed.\nCritical reception.\nFor the \"Centre Daily Times\", Jacob W. Michaels noted that, by this book, the series is \"beginning to drag\" due to the complexity of the story and the number of main characters. Despite entire chapters dedicated to backstory, one of the primary characters, rebel leader Egwene, is almost entirely ignored and separated from the plot, which Michaels complained was an ongoing trend of at least one overlooked character in each book in the series. He did say that the final scene of the book, which changed and recontextualized much of the prior works, was worth its entry in the series, but only for those already invested from reading the rest of the books.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Mrs. Miniver story was later adapted into a film of the same name and starred Greer Garson in the titular role for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress.\nOrigin.\nIn the 1930s, Jan Struther started to write for \"Punch\" magazine, and this brought her to the attention of \"The Times\" newspaper, where Peter Fleming asked her to write a series of columns for the paper, about \"an ordinary sort of woman who leads an ordinary sort of life \u2013 rather like yourself\". The resulting character that she created, Mrs. Kay Miniver, a British housewife living in Chelsea, proved a huge success from the character's inception in 1937, and the columns were subsequently published in book form in 1939. On the outbreak of war, this book became the basis for a patriotic and sentimental American film, \"Mrs. Miniver\", released in 1942, which won six Academy Awards, including Best Picture.\n\"The Times\" columns were short reflections on everyday life, based in part on Struther's own family and experiences. While the columns started as lighthearted domestic scenes where the outside world barely intruded, the approach of World War II slowly brought darker global concerns into Mrs. Miniver's world. One of the more memorable pieces appears near the middle of the series, where the Minivers get gas masks.\nBook publication.\nThe columns were first published in book form in 1939, shortly after the outbreak of World War II. Struther stopped the regular newspaper columns that year, but wrote a series of letters from Mrs. Miniver, expanding on the character's wartime experiences. These were published in later editions.\nThe book became an enormous success, especially in the United States, where Struther went on a lecture tour shortly after the book's release.\nThe U.S. was still officially neutral, but as war with Nazi Germany intensified in Europe, the tribulations of the Miniver family engaged the sympathy of the American public sufficiently that President Franklin D. Roosevelt credited it for hastening America's involvement in the war. Winston Churchill is said to have claimed that it had done more for the Allied cause than a flotilla of battleships. Churchill is further quoted by Bernard Wasserstein in his book, \"Barbarism and Civilization,\" as saying that the book (and later the film) was worth \"six divisions of war effort.\"\nIn 1942, when the film came out, Roosevelt ordered it rushed to theaters.\nAdaptations.\nFilm.\nThe film adaptation of \"Mrs. Miniver\" was produced by MGM in 1942 with Greer Garson in the leading role and William Wyler directing. Under the influence of the American Office of War Information, the film attempted to undermine Hollywood's prewar depiction of Britain as a glamorous bastion of social privilege, anachronistic habits and snobbery in favour of more democratic, modern images. To this end, the social status enjoyed by the Miniver family in the print version was downgraded and increased attention was given to the erosion of class barriers under the pressures of wartime.\nIn 1942, the film won an Oscar in the Best Picture category and both Greer Garson and Teresa Wright won an Oscar in the Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress categories, respectively.\nThe film grossed $5,358,000 () in North America (the highest for any MGM film at the time) and $3,520,000 abroad . In Britain, it was named the top box office attraction of 1942. 555 of the 592 film critics polled by American magazine \"Film Daily\" named it the best film of 1942.\nA sequel to \"Mrs. Miniver\", \"The Miniver Story\" was made by the same studio in 1950 with Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon reprising their original roles. The characters were based on those in the original film, but their creator, Jan Struther, did not participate in the sequel.\nRadio.\nIn 1944, CBS Radio presented a Friday-night series named \"Mrs. Miniver\" starring Judith Evelyn and Karl Swenson. They were soon replaced by Gertrude Warner and John Moore. But the show only lasted 9 months.\nTelevision.\nIn 1960, CBS Television presented Mrs. Miniver starring Maureen O'Hara as Mrs Miniver, Leo Genn as Clem Miniver, Juliet Mills and Keir Dullea.\nThe adaptation was by George Bart and was directed by Marc Daniels.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "42580", "revid": "753665", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42580", "title": "Leopoldo Galtieri", "text": "Argentine general and military ruler (1926\u20132003)\nLeopoldo Fortunato Galtieri Castelli (15 July 1926\u00a0\u2013 12 January 2003) was an Argentine military officer who served as the \"de facto\" President of Argentina from December 1981 to June 1982. Galtieri ruled as a military dictator during the National Reorganization Process as leader of the Third Junta with Jorge Anaya and Basilio Lami Dozo.\nGaltieri was chief combat engineer of the Argentine Army and a patron of the 1976 military coup d'\u00e9tat which helped him become commander-in-chief of the army in 1980. Galtieri overthrew Roberto Eduardo Viola, was appointed president, and established Argentina as a strong Cold War ally of NATO and the United States, while introducing fiscally conservative economic reforms, and increasing Argentine covert support for the anti-communist Contras guerrillas during the Nicaraguan civil war. In domestic policy, General Galtieri continued the Dirty War with the 601 Intelligence Battalion death squad reporting directly to him. \nGaltieri's declining popularity due to his human rights abuses and the worsening economic stagnation caused him to order an invasion of the Falkland Islands in April 1982. Galtieri was removed from power after Argentina's defeat by the British Armed Forces in the Falklands War in June, which led to the restoration of democracy and, in 1986, his court martial prosecution and conviction for war crimes and other offenses. Galtieri was pardoned by Carlos Menem in 1989 and lived in obscurity until his arrest for new charges shortly before his death in 2003.\nEarly life.\nLeopoldo Fortunato Galtieri was born on 15 July 1926 in Caseros, Buenos Aires Province to working-class Italian Argentine parents Francisco Rosario Galtieri and N\u00e9lida Victoria Castelli. In 1943, at 17 years-old, he enrolled at the National Military Academy to study civil engineering, and his early military career was as an officer in the engineering branch of the Argentine Army. As well as rising through the ranks of the military, he continued his studies in engineering until the mid-1950s. In 1949 he graduated from the US Army School of the Americas. In 1958, he became a professor of engineering at the Senior War College.\nGaltieri was married to Luc\u00eda Noem\u00ed Gentili, and the couple had one son and two daughters.\nRise to power.\nIn 1975, after more than 25 years as a combat engineer, Galtieri became commander of the Argentine engineering corps. He was an enthusiastic supporter of the March 1976 coup d'\u00e9tat that overthrew President Isabel Per\u00f3n and started the self-styled National Reorganisation Process, the establishment of a right-wing military junta government in Argentina. This helped him rise through the ranks, becoming a major general in 1977, and commander-in-chief of the army in 1980 with the rank of lieutenant general. During the junta's rule, Congress was suspended, trade unions, political parties, and provincial governments were banned, and in what became known as the Dirty War, between 9,000 and 30,000 people deemed left-wing subversives disappeared from society with torture and mass executions being commonplace. Argentina's economy had been in dire condition prior to the coup and recovered for a short time. An impending economic collapse was one of the main justifications for the overthrow of Per\u00f3n and the civilian government.\nIn March 1981, Galtieri visited the United States and was warmly received, as the Reagan administration viewed the regime as a bulwark against communism. National Security Advisor Richard V. Allen described him as a \"majestic general\". An adherent to the Argentine military's Cold War-era doctrine of \"ideological frontiers\", Galtieri secured his country's support for Contra rebel groups opposing the Socialist Sandinista government in Nicaragua during the Nicaraguan Revolution. In August, he sent advisers to help organize the Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN, for a time the principal Contra group), as well as training FDN leaders in Argentine bases. His support for this initiative allowed Galtieri to remove a number of rival generals.\nPresidency.\nOn 22 December 1981, Galtieri was appointed President of Argentina eleven days after ousting Roberto Eduardo Viola, who had been in power since March. Officially Viola resigned due to a health issue and designated Interior Minister Horacio Liendo as his successor. In reality, Viola was removed from power due to his regime's inability to reverse the economic crisis which caused infighting within the military.\nGaltieri retained direct control of the army whilst President of the governing Military Junta and did not appoint a new commander-in-chief.\nPolitical policy.\nGaltieri instituted limited political reforms which allowed the expression of dissent, and anti-junta demonstrations soon became common, as did agitation for a return to democracy.\nEconomic policy.\nGaltieri appointed conservative economist and publisher Roberto Alemann as Economy Minister. Alemann inherited an economy in deep recession in the aftermath of Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Mart\u00ednez de Hoz's economic policies of the late 1970s. Alemann slashed spending, began selling off government-owned industries (with only minor success), enacted a tight monetary policy, and ordered salaries frozen (amid 130% inflation).\nThe Central Bank Circular 1050, which tied mortgage rates to the value of the US dollar locally, was maintained, however, leading to further deepening of the crisis; GDP fell by 5%, and business investment by 20% over the weakened levels of 1981.\nOne of Galtieri's closest allies, the head of the First Army Corps, General Guillermo Su\u00e1rez Mason, was named Chairman of Yacimientos Petrol\u00edferos Fiscales (YPF), at the time the state petroleum concern, and the largest company of any type in Argentina. Su\u00e1rez Mason's role would contribute to a US$6 billion loss for the company, the largest recorded corporate loss in the world, up to that point.\nForeign policy.\nGaltieri supported the Central Intelligence Agency in its fight against the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, while he was warmly welcomed during his visit to the White House. Argentina support became the principal source of funds and training for the Contras during Galtieri's tenure.\nArgentine military and intelligence cooperation with the Reagan Administration ended in 1982 when Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands.\nFalklands War.\nBy April 1982, Galtieri had been in office for four months and his popularity was low. On 2 April, on his orders, Argentine forces invaded the Falkland Islands, a United Kingdom territory subject to a long-standing Argentine claim.\nInitially the invasion was popular in Argentina, and the anti-junta demonstrations were replaced by patriotic demonstrations in support of Galtieri.\nGaltieri and most of his government mistakenly believed the United Kingdom would not respond militarily.\nThe British government led by the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, dispatched a naval task force to retake the islands militarily if Argentina refused to comply with a United Nations resolution demanding an immediate Argentine withdrawal. Argentina did not comply with the resolution which resulted in a surrender to British forces on 14 June 1982.\nArgentina was supported by Israel during the conflict, even though Galtieri's regime was openly anti-Semitic.\nDefeat, fall from power, trial and prison.\nOn 14 June 1982, the Falklands' capital, Stanley, was retaken by British forces. The fact that an administration ruled by military figures failed to contain the British military response provoked an unprecedented crisis inside the Junta. Galtieri was blamed for the defeat and was removed from power, and he spent the next 18 months at a well-protected country retreat while democracy was restored to Argentina. Along with other members of the former junta, he was arrested in late 1983 and charged in a military court with human rights violations during the Dirty War and with mismanaging the Falklands War. The Argentine Army's internal investigation, known as the Rattenbach report after the general who led it, recommended that those responsible for the misconduct of the war be prosecuted under the Code of Military Justice. In 1986 he was sentenced to twelve years in prison.\nGaltieri was cleared of the civil rights charges in December 1985, but (together with the Air Force and Navy commanders-in-chief) in May 1986 he was found guilty of mishandling the war and sentenced to prison. All three appealed in a civil court, and the prosecution appealed for heavier sentences. In November 1988 the original sentences were confirmed, and all three commanders were stripped of their rank. In 1989, Galtieri and 39 other officers of the dictatorship received President Carlos Menem's pardon.\nLater life, further accusations and 2002 arrest.\nGaltieri was heavily blamed for Argentina's defeat in the Falklands War. Following his release from prison, he moved to the Villa Devoto suburb of Buenos Aires, and lived modestly with his wife Luc\u00eda. He became a recluse and refused most requests for interviews by journalists, though in a rare interview he stated he had \"no regrets\" over anything he had done during the Dirty War. He lived on an army pension of 9,000 pesos per month, and attempted to claim a Presidential pension, but a judge denied it. In her ruling, the judge stated that his presidency had been illegal due to his never having been elected, and she also ordered him to pay court costs.\nIn May 2002, he was invited to the military parade of the Argentine Army for the celebrations of Argentine Army Day (D\u00eda del Ej\u00e9rcito Argentino): the presence of the former \"president de facto\" caused a huge controversy in public opinion after he was confronted and questioned by the journalist Mart\u00edn Ciccioli in the television programme \"Kaos en la Ciudad\".\nIn July 2002, new civil charges were brought concerning the kidnapping of children and the disappearance of 18 leftist sympathizers in the late 1970s (while Galtieri was commander of the Second Army Corps), and the disappearance or death of three Spanish citizens at about the same time. Galtieri faced prosecution with 28 other officials, but due to his poor health, he was allowed to remain at home. On 11 July 2002, Galtieri was arrested. On 12 July 2002, after being held in military barracks, Galtieri was, as a result of ongoing heart problems, transferred to house arrest, which he remained under at the time of his death in January 2003.\nDeath.\nGaltieri underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer on 16 August 2002 at a hospital in Buenos Aires. He died there of a heart attack on 12 January 2003, aged 76. His body is interred in a small mausoleum at La Chacarita Cemetery.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Sigismund I was a member of the Jagiellonian dynasty, the son of Casimir IV and younger brother of Kings John I Albert and Alexander I Jagiellon. He was nicknamed \"the Old\" in later historiography to distinguish him from his son and successor, Sigismund II Augustus. Before ascending to the Polish and Lithuanian thrones, he was Duke of G\u0142og\u00f3w from 1499, Duke of Opava from 1501, and governor of Silesia from 1504 on behalf of his brother, King Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary.\nSigismund was born in the town of Kozienice in 1467 as the fifth son of Casimir IV and his wife Elizabeth of Austria. He was one of thirteen children and was not expected to assume the throne after his father. Sigismund's eldest brother and rightful heir Vladislaus II instead became the King of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia as the successor to George of Pod\u011bbrady in Bohemia and then to Matthias Corvinus in Hungary, thus temporarily uniting these kingdoms. When Casimir died, the Polish-Lithuanian realm was divided between the remaining two older sons, with John Albert being crowned King of Poland, and Alexander as Grand Duke of Lithuania. Alexander inherited Poland following John Albert's sudden death in 1501. Hence, Sigismund's reign only began when he succeeded Alexander to both titles in 1506 at the age of 39.\nA capable monarch and a patron of arts, Sigismund established Polish rule over Ducal Prussia and annexed the Duchy of Mazovia with Warsaw, while retaining the nation's wealth and prominence in the region. He made sure that his nephew Albert, Duke of Prussia, and Albert's Protestant successors would pay feudal homage or tribute to Polish monarchs as a sign of political and diplomatic dependence. This was observed until the Treaty of Bromberg in 1657 when Prussia gained its sovereignty. Sigismund and his commander Jan Amor Tarnowski also defeated Moldavia at Obertyn in 1531, and Muscovy in 1535, thereby strengthening the country's eastern borders. His 42-year reign was further marked by decisive contributions to Polish architecture, cuisine, language, and customs, especially at the behest of his second wife, the Italian-born Bona Sforza. Italian styles and fashions dominated at the height of the Polish Renaissance and Polish Golden Age, which developed the Catholic identity of Poland. He was commemorated on a contemporary 200-z\u0142oty banknote.\nSigismund was married twice, first to noblewoman Barbara Z\u00e1polya from Hungary and then to Bona Sforza, the daughter of Gian Galeazzo Sforza, Duke of Milan. Their only surviving son and the last Jagiellon king, Sigismund Augustus, was made his co-king \"vivente rege\" in 1529 and formally assumed throne when Sigismund the Old died in 1548.\nEarly life and coronation.\nSigismund was the son of King Casimir IV Jagiellon and Elisabeth Habsburg of Austria. He followed his brothers John Albert and Alexander to the Polish throne. Their eldest brother Vladislaus became king of Bohemia, Hungary, and Croatia. Sigismund was christened as the namesake of his maternal great-grandfather, Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund.\nWhen Casimir died in 1492, Sigismund was his only son without any titles or land. From 1495 to 1496, he petitioned his brother Alexander to provide him with land, and Elisabeth of Austria attempted to install him on the Austrian throne. Both efforts failed. In 1497, King John I Albert, his older brother, led an invasion of Moldavia that was intended to place Sigismund on its throne. This, too, was a disastrous failure. Finally, his eldest brother Vladislaus II, King of Bohemia and Hungary, granted him the duchies of G\u0142og\u00f3w (1499) and Opava (1501), and in 1504 Sigismund became governor of Silesia and Lower Lusatia.\nJohn I Albert died suddenly in 1501, and was succeeded by Alexander I, who died in 1506. After his death, Sigismund arrived in Vilnius, where he was elected by the Lithuanian Ducal Council on 13 September 1506 as Grand Duke of Lithuania, contrary to the Union of Mielnik (1501), which proposed a joint Polish-Lithuanian election of a monarch. On 8 December 1506, during the session of the Polish Senate in Piotrk\u00f3w, Sigismund was elected King of Poland. He arrived in Krak\u00f3w on 20 January 1507 and was crowned four days later in Wawel Cathedral by Primate Andrzej Boryszewski.\nInternal politics.\nCrown of the Kingdom of Poland.\nThe internal situation in Poland was characterised by broad authorisation of the Chamber of Deputies, confirmed and extended in the constitution of \"Nihil novi\". During Alexander's reign, the law of \"Nihil novi\" had been instituted, which forbade kings of Poland from enacting laws without the consent of the Sejm. Sigismund had little control over the act, unlike the senators, whom he personally appointed. Eventually, during his reign, Sigismund benefited from the advice of the local nobility, competent ministers in charge of the royal judiciary system, and the wealthy influential treasurers of Krak\u00f3w. Although he was reluctant to the parliamentary system and political independence of the nobility, he recognised the authority of legal norms, supported legalism and summoned annual sessions of the Sejm, usually obtaining funds on state defence. However he was unsuccessful at attempting to create a permanent fund for defence from the annual income tax. Despite this, in 1527 he established a conscript army and the bureaucracy needed to finance it. He set up the legal codes that formalised serfdom in Poland, placing the peasants into the private estates of nobles.\nLikely related to tax matters was an unsuccessful attempt on the life of the king, made on 5 May 1523. The identity of the would-be assassin - who shot the ruler while he was strolling in the evening around the cloisters of the Wawel castle - and his potential supporters was never established. Unclear motives remained after the assassination attempt. Three weeks before the event, Sigismund I introduced a new edict that was very unfavourable and somewhat hostile to the high-ranking nobles and their interests.\nSigismund I achieved several economic successes, including partial debt reduction, separation of accounts of public taxation from the royal treasury, strengthening of the activities of the mint operating in Krak\u00f3w, and the attempt to organise the processing of income from operating salt mines. Furthermore, he issued a statute for the Armenians (1519) and strongly intended to harmonise the judicial system across the country.\nBetween 1530 and 1538 the king issued two statutes defining the rules for the selection of the monarch, which permanently established the election \"viritim\". The laws held that all social groups, regardless of their wealth, could watch the election process (\"unusquisque qui vellet\"), and the election was to be free (\"electio Regis libera\").\nSigismund successfully organised the agricultural economy, looked after the development of the royal cities and recovered numerous goods of the treasury belonging to the crown that were under lien. During the financial activities, the King received full support of his wife, Queen Bona, who aimed to expand the royal estates by purchasing and improving economic efficiency. In 1514 he set up the Council of Four Lands and put Abraham of Bohemia in charge of it.\nChicken War Rebellion.\nAt the start of his reign, King Sigismund I the Old inherited a Kingdom of Poland with a century-long tradition of liberties of the nobility, confirmed in numerous privileges. A rebellion in Lw\u00f3w widely known as the Chicken War () was an anti-royalist and anti-absolutist rokosz (revolt) by the Polish nobility that occurred in 1537. The derisive name was coined by the magnates, who for the most part supported the King and claimed that the \"war's\" only effect was the near-extinction of the local chickens, eaten by the nobles gathered for the rebellion at Lw\u00f3w in eastern part of Lesser Poland.\nTo strengthen his power, Sigismund initiated a set of reforms, establishing a permanent conscription army in 1527 and extending the bureaucratic apparatus necessary to govern the state and finance the army. Supported by his Italian consort Bona Sforza, he began buying up land and issue agriculture reformas to enlarge the royal treasury. He initiated a process of restitution of royal properties, previously pawned or rented to the nobles.\nThe nobility gathered near the city to meet to a \"lev\u00e9e en masse\" and called for a military campaign against Moldavia. However, the lesser and middle strata of the nobility organised a revolt to force the King to abandon his risky reforms. The nobles presented him with 36 demands, most notably a cessation of further land acquisitions by Queen Bona, exemption of the nobility from the tithe, confirmation and extension of privileges for nobles and adoption of a law concerning Incompatibilitas \u2014 an individual wouldn't be able to hold two or more official administrative positions in the country. The role of the Incompatibilitas was to prevent wealthy magnates from usurping too much power at the expense of lesser nobles.\nHowever, the revolt soon transpired that the nobility's leaders were divided and that achieving a settlement was almost impossible. Too weak to start a civil war against the King, the protesters finally agreed to what was thought a compromise. Sigismund rejected most of their demands, while accepting the principle of Incompatibilitas the following year and agreeing not to force the election of the future king in \"vivente rege\". Thereupon, the nobility returned to their homes having achieved little.\nForeign politics.\nWar with Moscow.\nSigismund was intermittently at war with Vasili III of Muscovy beginning in 1507, before the Polish army was fully under his command. Further tensions escalated when Vasili also discovered that Sigismund was bribing Khan Me\u00f1li I Giray to attack the Grand Duchy of Moscow. In December 1512, Muscovite forces marched into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania seeking to capture Smolensk, a major trading center between Russia and Europe. The initial six- and four-week sieges in 1513 were a failure, but the city fell to the Muscovites in July 1514.\nRussia subsequently suffered a series of disastrous defeats in the field. In 1512, Grand Hetman of Lithuania, Konstanty Ostrogski, ransacked the region of Severia and vanquished a Russian force of approximately 6,000 men. On 8 September 1514, Muscovy suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Orsha, which prevented the Russians to place all the former Kievan Rus' lands under their lordship. Poland exploited the battle for propaganda purposes with strong anti-Russian sentiment. A letter sent to Rome stated that \"Muscovites are not Christians; they are cruel and barbaric; they are Asians and not Europeans; they are in league with Turks and the Tatars to destroy Christendom\".\nRegardless of victory, the Polish\u2013Lithuanian troops were incapable of moving quickly enough to retake Smolensk. In 1518, Russian forces were again beaten during the siege of Polotsk, when according to legend the Lithuanian forces were inspired by the sight of their patron saint, Saint Casimir, the older brother of Sigismund. However, this was dubbed by historians as a folk tale. In 1522, a truce was signed between Lithuania and Muscovy which extended until 1534.\nIn 1534, when Grand Hetman Jerzy Radziwi\u0142\u0142 and the Tatars pillaged western Russia, the Muscovites in retaliation invaded Lithuania once more. They were eventually stopped by Polish commander Jan Amor Tarnowski and allies at Starodub in 1535. Their defeat strengthened the Polish-Lithuanian union's eastern flank until the beginning of the Livonian War in 1558.\nEurope.\nIn 1515 Sigismund entered into an alliance with the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I. In return for Maximilian lending weight to the provisions of the Second Peace of Thorn (1466), Sigismund consented to the marriage of the children of Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary, his brother, to the grandchildren of Maximilian. Through this double marriage contract, Bohemia and Hungary passed to the House of Habsburg in 1526, on the death of Sigismund's nephew, Louis II, who led his forces against Suleiman the Magnificent of the Ottoman Empire in the disastrous Battle of Moh\u00e1cs.\nWorried about the growing ties between the Habsburgs and Russia, in 1524 Sigismund signed a Franco-Polish alliance with King Francis I of France to avoid a possible war on two fronts. Francis I himself was looking for allies in Central Europe to curtail the increasing power of Habsburg Emperor Charles V, whose realms were labelled \"the empire on which the sun never sets\". Furthermore, Queen Bona was instrumental in establishing an alliance between Poland and France, with the objective of recovering Milan. The official negotiations were conducted by Antonio Rincon in 1524, who was then followed by Jerome Laski. Through the agreement, the son of Francis, Henry, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, was to marry one of Sigismund's daughters, and Sigismund's eldest son was to marry a daughter of Francis I.\nThe negotiations came to an end and the alliance was disbanded when Francis' troops were defeated by Charles V at the Battle of Pavia in 1525. Disturbed by the failure of his campaign, Francis turned to Hungary instead and formed a Franco-Hungarian alliance with King John Z\u00e1polya in 1528.\nAfter the death of Janusz III of Masovia in 1526, Sigismund succeeded in uniting the Duchy of Masovia and Warsaw with the Kingdom of Poland. There was speculation whether Janusz and his younger brother Stanis\u0142aw were poisoned by a subject of Queen Bona. The accusations were so pervasive and rampant that Sigismund ordered an investigation, as a result of which a special edict was declared on 9 February 1528 confirming that the Masovian princes died naturally or due to related illness. According to chronicler Jan D\u0142ugosz, the real cause of the death of both princes could have been inherited tuberculosis.\nIn other matters of policy, Sigismund sought peaceful coexistence with the Khanate of Crimea, but was unable to completely end border skirmishes.\nTeutonic Knights.\nOver two centuries of wars against the Teutonic Knights ended in 1525 with the Treaty of Krak\u00f3w after the final Polish\u2013Teutonic War (1519\u20131521). Previously, the Second Peace of Thorn (1466) placed the Teutonic Order under Polish suzerainty and interfered with German interests in Livonia, Pomerania, Warmia and Masuria. The Order attempted to avoid paying tribute to Polish monarchs which was a demonstration of weakness and dependence.\nIn accordance with the new Treaty of Krak\u00f3w, the Order was abruptly secularized and turned de facto into a puppet state of Poland which lasted until the Treaty of Bromberg in 1655. Sigismund's nephew Albert, Duke of Prussia, converted to Lutheranism under the persuasion of Martin Luther, and paid a feudal homage to Sigismund. In return he was granted the domains of the Order as the First Duke of Prussia. This became known in Polish and Lithuanian history as the \"Prussian Homage\", which was often featured in arts. The Prussian Landtag and parliament assembled in K\u00f6nigsberg, where envoys embraced both the new Duke and the Protestant Reformation. Thereupon, the Teutonic Order lost its importance as a military order in Prussia and retreated to the Holy Roman Empire where it became secluded.\nRenaissance and legacy.\nSigismund had a profound interest in Renaissance humanism and the revival of classical antiquity. His second consort Bona Sforza, daughter of Gian Galeazzo Sforza of Milan, was also instrumental in developing the Polish Renaissance and brought renowned Italian artists, architects and sculptors from her native country. It was under Sigismund's reign that Renaissance began to flourish in Poland and in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Sigismund II Augustus later continued his father's legacy.\nAmong the illustrious figures that guested or lived in Poland at the time were Bartholommeo Berecci, Francesco Fiorentino, Santi and Mateo Gucci, Bernardo Morando, Giovanni Battista di Quadro and Hans D\u00fcrer. Most of the decorators working for the court were foreigners, especially Italians and Germans who had a profound impact on Poland's architecture as a whole. The centrepiece of their work is Wawel Castle in Krak\u00f3w, the seat of Polish monarchs as well as one of the largest castles in Central Europe. Situated on a hill overlooking Old Town, the fortified residence was extensively reconstructed in the Renaissance style and to the personal needs of the royal family. The Italian cloistered courtyard in the shape of a quadrangle, corridors, archways and portals were designed by Fiorentino with the help of Benedykt from Sandomierz. A similar design was undertaken in Niepo\u0142omice Castle, the hunting retreat of the Jagiellons.\nThe most prominent example of Sigismund's architectural legacy is a funerary monument in the form of a chapel at Wawel Cathedral. It was constructed between 1519 and 1533 according to plans by Bartolomeo Berrecci of Florence, and serves as a mausoleum of the last Jagiellons. The exterior dome is gold-plated and interior tombs made of marble were designed by Santi Gucci. Historians, experts and architects unanimously voted the chapel as \"the most beautiful example of the Tuscan Renaissance north of the Alps\". The monarch also commissioned a 12.6-tonne bell which was named in his honour. The Royal Sigismund Bell was installed 13 July 1521 on Wawel Cathedral's northernmost tower. Apart from religious and national holidays, the bell rung on some of the most significant moments in Polish history and is one of Poland's national symbols.\nDeath and succession.\nSigismund suffered from numerous illnesses and diseases, especially towards the end of his life. Most notably, he was tormented by constant fevers since youth as well as gout and acute rheumatism in the autumn of 1528. The condition, which severely affected his joints and right leg, was repetitive and continued in 1529 and 1534. It is likely that reasons why Sigismund Augustus was made co-ruler \"vivente rege\" in 1529 were pervasive pains of his father and fear he would die unexpectedly. Furthermore, bad eating habits and a poor diet contributed to the king's ailing health, in particular large amounts of beer and mead. Eventually, the king's inability to walk forced him to be carried in a litter. However, despite his age, Sigismund was of sound mind throughout and remained active in politics until death. In 1543, he recovered from an influenza which spread in Krak\u00f3w and in 1545 he enjoyed a last hunting excursion to Niepo\u0142omice.\nSigismund died on 1 April 1548, Easter day at the age of 81 and was buried on 7 July at Wawel Cathedral in Krak\u00f3w. He was laid next to his and Queen Bona's deceased younger son, Prince Albertus. The King was succeeded by his only living legitimate son, Sigismund II Augustus, who became the last Jagiellon king of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania. In 1587 Sigismund the Old's grandson, Sigismund III from the House of Vasa, was elected King of Poland. He was the son of Catherine Jagiellon and her husband John III Vasa of Sweden. Hence, Sigismund III could not belong to the Jagiellonian dynasty by his mother, but the Jagiellon bloodline of Polish monarchs continued until the death of Sigismund Vasa's second son John II Casimir.\nMarriages and issue.\nIn 1512, Sigismund married Barbara Z\u00e1polya (d. 1515), a Hungarian noblewoman, with whom he had two daughters:\nIn 1517, Sigismund married Bona Sforza, with whom he had two sons and four daughters:\nBy his mistress, Katarzyna Telniczanka (d. 1528), he also fathered three children prior to his first marriage:\nCitations and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the eldest son of W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o (Jogaila) and the Lithuanian noblewoman Sophia of Halshany.\nW\u0142adys\u0142aw succeeded his father shortly before turning ten in 1434 and was, therefore, deemed unfit to rule until coming of age. Cardinal Zbigniew Ole\u015bnicki acted as regent and a temporary \"provisores\" council executed power in the king's name. However, W\u0142adys\u0142aw's legitimacy to the crown was contested by Lesser Polish nobles favouring the candidacy of Siemowit V of Masovia, who was of Piast lineage. In the aftermath of the coronation, Spytko III of Melsztyn accused Ole\u015bnicki, the council and the Catholic Church of exploiting the king's youth to hold authority. A sympathiser with the Czech Hussites, Spytko was killed at the Battle of Grotniki in 1439, thus ending the hostilities.\nW\u0142adys\u0142aw simultaneously faced the effects of the Polish\u2013Teutonic War, which commenced under his father's reign in 1431. The Teutonic Knights began supporting \u0160vitrigaila and the Livonian Order in a military struggle against Poland and Sigismund K\u0119stutaitis of Lithuania in 1434, shortly after W\u0142adys\u0142aw assumed the throne. Consequently, the king and the Polish Royal Council, the \"curia regis\", renewed their war efforts by fortifying the borderland regions and sending an army to Lithuania, which was engulfed in a civil war since 1432. \u0160vitrigaila, the Livonians and their allies were ultimately defeated at the Battle of Wi\u0142komierz, and W\u0142adys\u0142aw forced the Peace of Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski on the Teutonic State in December 1435, which curtailed Teutonic influence in East-Central Europe.\nThe policy of the Kingdom of Poland under W\u0142adys\u0142aw and Ole\u015bnicki was to reclaim lost territories such as Silesia or Pomerania and expand its influence to neighbouring realms. In 1440, W\u0142adys\u0142aw was elected King of Hungary and Croatia following the death of Albert II of Germany. Albert's widow, Elizabeth of Luxembourg, spurned the outcome and advocated for her infant son, Ladislaus the Posthumous, to rule under the guardianship of Frederick III Habsburg whilst purloining the Holy Crown of Hungary. Prolonged hostilities from the Habsburgs, the imminent Ottoman advance into Hungary and Elizabeth's sudden death solidified W\u0142adys\u0142aw's legitimacy to the Hungarian throne. Ruling much of Southeastern and Central Europe, W\u0142adys\u0142aw became compelled in confronting the Ottoman Empire.\nWith the Turkish grip over the Balkans weakened in the aftermath of the Hungarian\u2013Ottoman War (1437\u20131442), the papacy and papal legate Julian Cesarini urged W\u0142adys\u0142aw to launch the Crusade of Varna. After initial successes, the outnumbered Christian forces engaged in a decisive battle at Varna, where W\u0142adys\u0142aw was reportedly killed in a heroic cavalry charge against Sultan Murad II. His body was never recovered and its disappearance led to numerous survival theories or legends, none of which have been confirmed. W\u0142adys\u0142aw's legacy in Poland and Hungary is divisive, yet W\u0142adys\u0142aw remains a notable figure in countries like Bulgaria, which were under Ottoman domination. He was succeeded in Poland by his younger brother Casimir IV, and in Hungary-Croatia by his rival Ladislaus V the Posthumous.\nEarly life, 1424\u20131434.\nChildhood, 1424\u20131431.\nW\u0142adys\u0142aw was born in Krak\u00f3w on 31 October 1424, the first-born son of W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o (his pagan name was Jogaila) and Sophia of Halshany, both of whom were Lithuanian in origin. His father was already an elderly man, having outlived three of his consorts, and the birth of a male successor was widely regarded as a miracle. He was baptised at Wawel Cathedral in mid-February 1425 by Wojciech Jastrz\u0119biec, Bishop of Gniezno and Primate of Poland. It took place in the presence of Andrzej \u0141askarz Laskary, Bishop of Pozna\u0144 and Zbigniew Ole\u015bnicki, Bishop of Krak\u00f3w as well as statesmen and royal emissaries from the surrounding realms. The ceremony was unequivocally grandiose; the most probable day of the baptism is 18 February, though this continues to be contested by historians and various sources.\nIn 1427, the Polish nobility initiated anti-Jagiellonian opposition and attempted to have Jogaila's sons declared illegitimate to the Polish throne as they possessed no blood relation to their Piast and Anjou predecessors. In the same year, Queen Sophia was accused of adultery, which aggravated the conflict. Despite the agreements signed between Jogaila and the magnates to ensure the succession for his sons, the opposing faction opted for Frederick II of Brandenburg, who was betrothed to Hedwig Jagiellon, Jogaila's daughter by his second wife. However, the conspiracy was resolved by the death of the princess in December 1431, rumoured to have been poisoned by Sophia.\nOpposition and Cardinal Ole\u015bnicki, 1432\u20131434.\nFrom a young age, W\u0142adys\u0142aw was surrounded by advisors loyal to Zbigniew Ole\u015bnicki (known in Latin as Sbigneus), a cardinal who acted as royal guardian and aimed at maintaining his influence and high position at court. Ole\u015bnicki learned of Jogaila's death on 1 June 1434 in Pozna\u0144, whilst he was en route to the Council of Basel, but decided to remain in Poland and usurp the role of interrex. He subsequently convened an assembly in Pozna\u0144 with the assistance of Chancellor Jan Taszka Koniecpolski, and called for the nobles of Greater Poland to warrant W\u0142adys\u0142aw's right to the crown. This arbitrary behaviour displayed by the assembly vexed the nobility of Lesser Poland, who were outmanoeuvred and excluded from the vote.\nThere was growing antagonism in the demesne and the challengers feared that crowning a young and inexperienced king would invest Ole\u015bnicki with too much power over the affairs of state. Others repudiated a son of formerly-pagan Jogaila on the Polish throne and yearned for a living descendant of the Piast dynasty. The candidacy of Siemowit V remained a considerable threat to W\u0142adys\u0142aw, especially that Siemowit was of royal Piast lineage and a member of a branch that ruled the Duchy of Masovia since the Testament of Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth in the 12th century.\nMany opponents also attempted to counter the power of the Catholic clergy, notably under the influence of Hussitism from neighbouring Bohemia. Among the chief adversaries were Abraham Zb\u0105ski, the judge royal of Pozna\u0144 and a fierce propagator of the Hussites' proto-Protestant movement, Dziers\u0142aw Rytwia\u0144ski, and Spytko III of Melsztyn, a supporter of pro-Hussite military expeditions led by Sigismund Korybut to Bohemia in the years 1422\u20131427. They received clandestine sponsorship from influential magnates and nobles from Lesser Poland, who persuaded Ole\u015bnicki to delay the coronation until 25 July 1434. This granted the opposition additional time to establish an independent assembly on 13 July in Opat\u00f3w, where forthcoming actions were to be discussed. Ole\u015bnicki, having discovered their intent, arrived to the proceedings unannounced and successfully questioned its purpose, and the council hastily dissolved. Negotiations were held in Krak\u00f3w prior to 25 July with the dignitaries sent by Sigismund K\u0119stutaitis and Spytko, who attempted to obstruct W\u0142adys\u0142aw's accession. Jan G\u0142owacz Ole\u015bnicki, Crown Marshal of Poland and the brother of Zbigniew Ole\u015bnicki, called for a decisive vote, which ended the dispute.\nReign, 1434\u20131444.\nCoronation, 1434.\nW\u0142adys\u0142aw was crowned at Wawel Cathedral on 25 July 1434 by the elderly Wojciech Jastrz\u0119biec. There is evidence that the coronation was closely supervised by Ole\u015bnicki, who was instrumental in determining how the investiture is conducted. Changes were made to the order of formalities under Ole\u015bnicki's \"Ordo ad cornandum ad regem Poloniae\", notably the young monarch was obliged to take an oath before the anointment and the handing over of Polish royal insignia. This act was to be seen as submission to the privileges of nobles; the king-elect's fulfillment of the elites' requirements, not hereditary rights, was a condition for obtaining the throne in the Kingdom of Poland. Furthermore, the crown jewels were given to the officials, rather than being placed at the altar, implying W\u0142adys\u0142aw's minority and the officials' active participation in the coronation. The act in which W\u0142adys\u0142aw undertook \"signum crucis\" with a sword in the direction of the four corners of the world was abandoned.\nThe chronicler Jan D\u0142ugosz (Latin: Johannes Longinus) writes that the boy king, dressed in royal garments and accompanied by bishops Ole\u015bnicki and Stanis\u0142aw z Paw\u0142owic, Bishop of P\u0142ock, rode from Wawel Castle to greet the townsfolk. However, a customary feudal homage by the burghers at Krak\u00f3w Town Hall came into effect because of a disagreement between the bishops and Masovia princes concerning the order of precedence in the royal procession and on sitting arrangements.\nRegency, 1434\u20131438.\nShortly after the coronation, senior nobles held both covert and open conventions to discuss the possibility of instituting a regency as the king was still a minor and could not govern. Duke Siemowit, who was staying in the capital of Krak\u00f3w at the time, remained a valid contender for the role of regent or caretaker because of his personal qualities and rank, however, the idea was soon dismissed. Many of the noble lords believed that Siemowit could seize the crown for himself, rather than remain an inferior subject to the boy. Queen Sophia's attempts to be named regent, in accordance with her late husband's instructions, also failed and the general indecisiveness caused the apex of oligarch influence in medieval Poland. As compromise, a regency council was formed comprising regional governors called the \"provisores\". D\u0142ugosz noted three members, each selected for merit and \"wisdom\", which was possibly aimed at curtailing Zbigniew Ole\u015bnicki's influence. Nonetheless, Ole\u015bnicki retained considerable control over W\u0142adys\u0142aw's upbringing.\nIt is believed that W\u0142adys\u0142aw did not have a decisive voice in politics and the situation did not change even after the Sejm, the Polish Parliament, had gathered in Piotrk\u00f3w in 1438 and declared the 14-year-old king to have attained his majority.\nCivil war in Lithuania, 1434\u20131438.\nW\u0142adys\u0142aw faced certain challenges early in his reign, in particular the inherited situation in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was precarious and the ensuing Lithuanian Civil War (1432\u20131438) threatened Polish interests there. The conflict began when W\u0142adys\u0142aw's paternal uncle, \u0160vitrigaila, refused to acknowledge fealty to his brother Jogaila and proclaimed political independence, jeopardising the Polish\u2013Lithuanian union. He subsequently battled against Polish\u2013Lithuanian forces in Volhynia and established an anti-Polish coalition. In June 1431, he reached an agreement with the Teutonic State, which declared a surprise war and marched its army into Polish territory. Following a truce with the Teutonic Knights, the war resumed when W\u0142adys\u0142aw became king. The situation swiftly transformed into a diplomatic struggle for W\u0142adys\u0142aw and the Poles, who sought to turn Lithuanian nobles against \u0160vitrigaila and have him ousted.\nA Polish retinue of approximately 4,000 men under Jakub Kobyla\u0144ski assisted the Lithuanians headed by Sigismund K\u0119stutaitis and Michael \u017dygimantaitis; their joint army defeated \u0160vitrigaila and his allies, Sigismund Korybut and the Livonian Order, on 1 September 1435 at the Battle of Wi\u0142komierz. \u0160vitrigaila fled eastward, but eventually lost the support of the Ruthenians residing in the Grand Duchy and went into exile to Moldavia in 1438, thus ending civil war. However, unrest re-emerged when Sigismund K\u0119stutaitis was assassinated on 20 March 1440 and W\u0142adys\u0142aw's younger brother, Casimir, was proclaimed Grand Duke by Jonas Go\u0161tautas and the Lithuanian Council of Lords on 29 June 1440. This was met with hostility at the Polish court, especially that Casimir was underage and that the Poles hoped for a vicegerent that would submit to Poland. Regardless of the outcome, W\u0142adys\u0142aw continued to use the title of Supreme Duke of Lithuania until death under the conditions of the 1413 Union of Horod\u0142o.\nThe battle also proved momentous in combating the Livonian Order as its Grand Master, Franco Kerskorff, and \"komtur\" commanders were killed or taken prisoner. The Livonian Confederation agreement from 4 December 1435 officially terminated its crusading character, and a formal peace treaty was signed on 31 December 1435 in Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski whereby the Teutonic and Livonian Orders pledged not to intrude or disturb the internal affairs of both Poland and Lithuania. That act concluded the Polish\u2013Teutonic War (1431\u20131435). Moreover, any association between the knights and the Pope or the Holy Roman Emperor would violate the treaty. His youth prevented W\u0142adys\u0142aw from engaging directly in the peace talks, and the negotiations were predominantly undertaken by diplomats or the clergy.\nDomestic and foreign policy, 1438\u20131440.\nThe successive years were marked by the extirpation of Polish Hussites under the Edict of Wielu\u0144, signed earlier in 1424. The initial hostilities eventually culminated in a minor rebellion during W\u0142adys\u0142aw's reign. On 3 May 1439, Spytko of Melsztyn formed a small but armed ad hoc confederation in the town of Nowy Korczyn against Ole\u015bnicki's desire to exterminate the Hussites and to challenge his authority over the young king. Consequently, Spytko was accused of high treason and maleficence. The cardinal sent crown troops to pacify the movement and execute the death warrant. Spytko was ultimately killed at the Battle of Grotniki. His corpse pierced with arrows laid bare in the field for three days, however, W\u0142adys\u0142aw personally ordered Spytko's body to be returned to his widow and restored the family's noble status and privileges.\nThe court also devised the return of lost territories, most notably the southern Duchies of Silesia, which continued to be ruled by the Silesian Piasts. In the north, the gentry of Greater Poland and Kuyavia demanded the recovery of Pomerania. Speaking on behalf of W\u0142adys\u0142aw, the cardinal was opposed to the idea of reclaiming Pomerania and believed that peace between Poland and the Teutonic Order was critical, as the Teutonic Knights were no longer a tool of the Holy Roman Emperor and were wary of taking up arms. He also dedicated himself to subtler diplomatic measures when addressing the issue of Silesia, a large historical region within the Bohemian Crown, but was unwilling to support the Hussites militarily against Sigismund of Luxembourg and his son-in-law, Albert II of Germany. The priority was diverted towards stabilising domestic affairs as well as maintaining Poland's status as a great power and a pillar of the Catholic Church in East-Central Europe.\nThe union with Lithuania remained impregnable, and a dynastic union with the Kingdom of Hungary was to be formed, as Sigismund had no male heirs. The Polish Sejm and statesmen hoped that by marrying W\u0142adys\u0142aw to one of Sigismund's granddaughters, Poland could secure his accession in Hungary and foist Jagiellonian rule there. That would restore a union of Hungary and Poland, which had not been seen since the reign of Louis I of Anjou (1370\u20131382). The union would also allow Poland to renegotiate disputed territories between the Poles and the Hungarians, including Halych (later constituting Galicia) and Moldavia. In response, Poland would propose a military alliance and vow the expulsion of the Ottoman Turks from Hungarian lands.\nKing of Hungary and Croatia, 1440.\nIn October 1439, Albert II died and left the Austrian, Bohemian and Hungarian thrones unoccupied. His only son, born in February 1440, became known as Ladislaus the Posthumous. Ladislaus' claim to the Duchy of Austria was acknowledged in accordance with Albert's testament. Under the influence and pressure of Old\u0159ich II of Rosenberg, the Catholic nobles were also inclined to endorse Ladislaus's hereditary right to Bohemia. Conversely, the Hungarians were not willing to pass his candidacy and began dialogue with the Poles. In early January 1440, the Hungarian Estates rejected the deceased king's testament at an assembly in Buda that would place the regency in the hands of Frederick III Habsburg.\nThe general animosity towards the Habsburg dynasty and the impending Ottoman threat prevented the Hungarians from accepting an infant as king and turned to Poland. Ladislaus' widowed mother, Queen Elizabeth of Luxembourg, was desperate to halt that and sent intermediaries to persuade the Hungarians to terminate all negotiations with W\u0142adys\u0142aw. Contrary to her efforts, the Hungarian nobles proved resolute and elected W\u0142adys\u0142aw king on 8 March 1440. Prior to his election, W\u0142adys\u0142aw vowed to marry Elizabeth and protect her infant son's interests in Austria and Bohemia. Simultaneously, W\u0142adys\u0142aw was made King of Croatia as the Croatian dominion was in a personal union with Hungary since 1102.\nElizabeth did not approve of the Estates' election, and on 15 May 1440, she had her son crowned with the Holy Crown of Hungary, which one of Elizabeth's ladies-in-waiting (Helene Kottanner) had stolen from safekeeping at the fortress of Visegr\u00e1d. The Hungarians soon decried the ceremony as an unlawful farce and utilised a reliquary crown for W\u0142adys\u0142aw's coronation on 17 July 1440 at the Basilica of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r. He had also received significant support from Pope Eugene IV, in exchange for his help in organising an anti-Muslim crusade. Although still young and king solely by title, W\u0142adys\u0142aw became deeply involved in the struggle against the Ottomans, having been brought up in the standard of a pious Christian monarch.\nDiscord and unrest, 1440\u20131442.\nShortly after W\u0142adys\u0142aw's accession the conflict with the supporters of Elizabeth deepened. The western and northern parts of the country remained on the side of the queen and opposing magnates, chiefly the Counts of Celje (Cilli), the Garai family and D\u00e9nes Sz\u00e9csi, Archbishop of Esztergom. In turn, the eastern regions and Transylvania upheld W\u0142adys\u0142aw and his partisans, among them John Hunyadi who became a leading political and military figure in Hungary.\nIn order to assert her claim, Elizabeth had to maintain the wealthy mining counties in what now constitutes Slovakia and hired Hussite mercenaries from Bohemia commanded by John Jiskra. Jiskra undertook a quick campaign and occupied much of the fortresses and defensive posts in northern Hungary, often with the support of local populations and devotees that held Jiskra in high regard because of his fight for religious freedoms. As a benefactor to the mercenaries, Elizabeth had to pawn the Holy Crown and transfer tutelage over her newborn son to Frederick III. However, this proved insufficient to fund the war against W\u0142adys\u0142aw; she was then forced to handover her privately owned Austrian estates and the Hungarian County of Sopron to the Habsburgs in late 1440 and early 1441. This conduct alienated many of the lords that initially supported Elizabeth's cause, including Nicholas of Ilok, Ban of Croatia, who switched sides and allied himself with W\u0142adys\u0142aw and John Hunyadi.\nThe western territories as well as some 70 fortresses under Ulrich II, Count of Celje in modern-day Austria, Croatia and Slovenia remained stalwart and loyal to the queen. Before the end of 1440, Hunyadi attacked Gy\u0151r but was unable to take the garrisoned city. He was, however, successful in capturing local townships and villages around Buda and Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r to prevent the escape of nobles and designated traitors. This proved paramount when Ulrich II made an attempt to flee to Bratislava (Pozsony); he was caught by a Polish detachment and subsequently imprisoned at W\u0142adys\u0142aw's behest. Concurrently, Ladislaus Garai instigated a rebellion in the south. Hunyadi, together with Nicholas of Ilok, annihilated Garai's army at B\u00e1tasz\u00e9k on 10 September 1440. In January 1441, Ulrich was released from captivity, pledged an oath of loyalty to W\u0142adys\u0142aw and freed the hostages held by his troops.\nElizabeth prolonged her resistance until December 1442, when a peace treaty was signed at Gy\u0151r under the auspices of Cardinal Julian Cesarini. Elizabeth died not long after meeting W\u0142adys\u0142aw and exchanging gifts; her supporters claimed that she was poisoned on his orders to prevent their marriage. Cesarini had the treaty ratified by Frederick under the pressure of Pope Eugene, though Frederick abstained from doing so until May 1444. The internal unrest caused Hungary to become vulnerable militarily and was severely weakened for the Turkish campaign.\nCrusade against the Muslim Ottomans, 1443\u20131444.\nThe prelude to the crusade began when the Turks were defeated in the Hungarian\u2013Ottoman War of 1437\u20131442 and temporarily lost jurisdiction over the Principality of Wallachia. In 1442, Sultan Murad II sent Mezid Bey into Transylvania with a large akinji army, raiding cities, towns and villages from the border to Sibiu (known in German as Hermannstadt and in Hungarian as Nagyszeben). Hunyadi initially lost the skirmish and one of the Hungarian leaders, Bishop Gy\u00f6rgy L\u00e9pes, was killed at S\u00e2ntimbru, Alba. However, a few days later Hunyadi regrouped and attacked Ottoman positions with heavy cavalry at the Battle of Hermannstadt, capturing and beheading Mezid. This empowered Hungary to coerce the Wallachians and Moldavians to change loyalty and turn into the vassals of Hungary. Murad sought revenge and entrusted Had\u0131m \u015eehabeddin, governor-general of Rumelia, with a new force to enter Wallachia; he too was defeated by Hunyadi near the Ialomi\u021ba River.\nThroughout the autumn of 1442, Cesarini and the Republic of Venice were planning a crusade against the Turks, with the papacy pledging patronage and considerable funding. The united force would set out from Hungary with an assembled fleet under Francesco Condulmer stationed at the Dardanelles Strait. The objective was to isolate routes and communication from Anatolia to Europe, protect Constantinople, and join with the land troops to capture Turkish defensive posts on the River Danube, thus leaving the Ottoman main army caught in Anatolia. Cesarini, acting as papal legate and gathering support, disseminated slogans and propaganda that would incite the Christian army to act. Moreover, Italian humanist Francesco Filelfo wrote a personal letter to W\u0142adys\u0142aw, describing him in Latin as the \"propugnaculum\", or the \"bulwark of Christianity\". On the other hand, Vlad II Dracul tried to dissuade W\u0142adys\u0142aw from waging war against the Ottomans. Nevertheless, Vlad Dracul provided 7,000 (according to some accounts 4,000) horsemen under the command of his son, Mircea, to fight against the Ottomans.\nOn 15 April 1444, at the diet in Buda and in the presence of Cardinal Cesarini, W\u0142adys\u0142aw swore to renew the war against Turkish infidels in the coming summer. Similar promises were made to the Venetian delegates, the Signoria of Florence and to the Kingdom of Bosnia. Philip the Good of Burgundy was also a generous benefactor to the Christian cause. Simultaneously, W\u0142adys\u0142aw engaged Stojka Gisdani\u0107 and dispatched him to Edirne as an envoy and mediator in peace talks with the Ottomans. In June 1444, the fleet of Francesco Condulmer and Alvise Loredan was ready to sail and by mid-July arrived at Methoni, Messenia, in modern-day Greece. Murad already crossed into Asia Minor by this time and the fleet was tasked with preventing re-entry by holding the strait against him.\nIn August, a Polish assembly at Piotrk\u00f3w implored him to make peace with the Ottomans, dissatisfied with the level of taxes raised for the war and believing that Murad's terms could be lucrative. The Poles were convinced that this would encourage W\u0142adys\u0142aw to leave the Balkans, return to Poland and re-establish himself there as king. Meanwhile, Cesarini sent letters of progress to Cyriacus of Ancona, who was staying in Constantinople; he then translated them from Latin into Greek for John VIII Palaiologos, Byzantine emperor. The Byzantines were ecstatic of the news brought by Cesarini, as were the Genoese colonies and Pera (Galata). Cyriacus also distributed letters to Neapolitan nobility and to Alfonso V of Aragon, urging them to join the campaign. The victory of Jean de Lastic and his Knights Hospitaller in the Siege of Rhodes contributed to the general euphoria surrounding the crusade.\nIn mid-August 1444, the Peace of Szeged was ratified in Oradea (V\u00e1rad). However, W\u0142adys\u0142aw abjured his oath and the war continued; on 20 September 1444 the king and Hunyadi crossed the Danube, beginning the army's march to the shores of the Black Sea to make contact with the allied fleet. The Pope annulled and released Gjergj Arianiti from peace he made with the Turks; Arianiti was then able to march with his troops to Macedonia and fight alongside the Christians if required. At this time, Murad concluded a favourable peace treaty with Ibrahim II of Karaman, who threatened Anatolia from the south. It allowed the Turks to focus their attention and resources on advancing into Europe; in late October 1444 he crossed the Bosphorus while the Christian fleet was stalled from adverse winds, and the Venetians did not make an effort to prevent that. Scholar Poggio Bracciolini appraised that as the true cause of the crusade's early failure. Genoese merchants and sailors were also accused of corruption and accepting bribes from Murad. According to witnesses, the Ottoman troops outnumbered the combined Christian forces and quickly marched to the Black Sea without a delay.\nBattle at Varna, disappearance and succession, 1444-1447.\nThe Venetian treachery placed the large Ottoman army of around 60,000 men in proximity to the unsuspecting 16,000 crusaders, almost outnumbering the Christians by three to one. The crusader fleet, largely manned by Venetian mercenaries and sailors, did not engage in direct combat and desisted from sailing into the Black Sea. Thereafter, the battle began on 10 November 1444 at Varna, Bulgaria; the crusaders were initially successful in defending against Ottoman assaults and Murad sustained heavy losses. Acts of heroism were abundant on the Christian side, almost making up for the lack of men; as was the courage displayed on the battlefield by John Hunyadi. Murad was wary of the battle at first and contemplated escaping when the crusaders took the left flank, but the Janissaries restrained him.\nHunyadi is purported to have proposed that the Christian left assists the right flank to move the Turks out of position, and stated that \"the son of Osman's army shall be defeated\". The Ottoman troops under Had\u0131m \u015eehabeddin of Rumelia began to break and some fled the battle, though the Turkish resistance was fierce. One of the crusaders, Andreas de Pallatio, later wrote in his memoirs that W\u0142adys\u0142aw seized the initiative on the Christian right flank and tore into \u015eehabeddin's ranks like \"a new Caesar\", pushing the Rumelians up the valley's slope. Many of the novice yet still elite Janissaries and azebs were driven back. Pallatio also notes that the size of Murad's army was too great to counter and it seemed as if the Christian offensive barely inflicted any major casualties. W\u0142adys\u0142aw's men quickly became exhausted, with many wounded by arrows and battered, including Hunyadi. In spite of this, the majority of the Ottoman army either fled or was dead. Consequently, Murad decided to seek refuge in his fortified encampment in the rear.\nFacing desperate circumstances and seeing Hunyadi's struggle against the Rumelian sipahis, W\u0142adys\u0142aw decided to take a chance by directly charging the sultan's camp and his armed retinue with heavy cavalry. Few men were able to see the charge and no one returned from the assault, which alarmed the crusaders. The young king was most likely killed when his charge lost impetus and came to a standstill amongst the unyielding Janissaries protecting the sultan. It is possible that the king's horse fell into a trap; Pope Pius II writes that W\u0142adys\u0142aw might have been dismounted from his horse by the Turks. The Janissaries reportedly killed the king's bodyguard, beheaded W\u0142adys\u0142aw and displayed his head on a lance, spear or pole, however, records about W\u0142adys\u0142aw's death come solely from Turkish side, with one account claiming even that he survived the battle but was executed in captivity; Polish relation of battle told by participant Grzegorz of Sanok states only that the King disappeared during battle and his fate remains unknown. Records mention a severed male head candied in a bowl of honey by the Turks, but the head contained blonde hair, and W\u0142adys\u0142aw was a brunette. Disheartened by the presumed death of the king, the Hungarian Army fled the battlefield, and the remainder surrendered. On his return, Hunyadi tried frantically to salvage the king's body; neither W\u0142adys\u0142aw's body nor his armour were ever found.\nW\u0142adys\u0142aw was succeeded in Poland by his younger brother, Duke Casimir IV of Lithuania, in 1447, after a three-year interregnum. In Hungary, he was succeeded by his former rival, the child-king Ladislaus the Posthumous.\nAppearance and personal life.\nAccording to 19th-century sources based on medieval chronicles, W\u0142adys\u0142aw was of medium height, with a swarthy (olive) complexion, dark hair, dark eyes, and possessed a graceful gaze. There are no other accounts disclosing his physical appearance. He did not indulge in overeating or excessive drinking, and was a person of extreme patience and piety. Furthermore, the king was known to be of strong character and merciful to his foes, when required.\nW\u0142adys\u0142aw had no children and did not marry. Contemporary sources suggest that he was homosexual. The chronicler Jan D\u0142ugosz, known for his antipathy towards the Jagiellons, alleged that there was something unusual about the monarch's sexuality. D\u0142ugosz did not specify the details behind that but stated \"too subject to his carnal desires\" and \"he did not abandon his lewd and despicable habits\". On the other hand, D\u0142ugosz noted later, \"No age has ever seen and will never see a more Catholic and holy ruler who, according to his highest goodness, has never harmed any Christian. [...] Finally, like a holy king and a second angel on Earth, he lived an unmarried and virgin life at home and during the war\".\nLegacy.\nW\u0142adys\u0142aw's legacy as King of Hungary was tarnished in existing records by the Habsburgs; the largely unrealistic picture of his reign presented in the \"Annales\" chronicles were constructed as a consistent polemic comprising the allegations of what is described as \"Habsburg propaganda\". Furthermore, W\u0142adys\u0142aw's claim to Hungary was deemed illegitimate and he was often portrayed as a usurper, who unsuccessfully launched a crusade against the Turks. Rumours also spread that W\u0142adys\u0142aw had Elizabeth of Luxembourg poisoned as her death occurred suddenly after their meeting in December 1442.\nFollowing his death, W\u0142adys\u0142aw III was commemorated in many songs and poems.\nA main boulevard and residential district in Varna are named after W\u0142adys\u0142aw. In 1935 a park-museum, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Warne\u0144czyk, opened in Varna, with a symbolic cenotaph built atop of an ancient Thracian mound tomb. There had been also a football team named after Vladislav in Varna, present day its inheritor is known as PFC Cherno More Varna.\nThe Hungarian book series about John Hunyadi was adapted into a television miniseries, \"Rise of the Raven\", released in 2025. The series also depicts the rise of Vladislaus I to the throne of the Kingdom of Hungary and dramatizes events surrounding the Battle of Varna.\nLegend of survival.\nAccording to a Portuguese legend W\u0142adys\u0142aw survived the battle and then journeyed in secrecy to the Holy Land. He became a knight of Saint Catharine of Mount Sinai (\"O Cavaleiro de Santa Catarina\") and then settled on Madeira. King Afonso V of Portugal granted him lands in the Madalena do Mar district of the Madeira Islands for life. He was known there as \"Henrique Alem\u00e3o\" (Henry the German) and married Senhorinha Anes, with the King of Portugal acting as his best man. The marriage produced two sons. He established a church of Saint Catherine and Mary Magdalene at Madalena do Mar in 1471. There he was depicted in a painting as Saint Joachim meeting Saint Anne at the Golden Gate on a painting by Master of the Adoration of Machico (Mestre \"da Adora\u00e7\u00e3o de Machico\") in the beginning of the 16th century.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As Grand Duke, he ruled Lithuania from 1377 to 1381 and from 1382 to 1401, at which time he became the Supreme Duke of Lithuania in exchange for naming his cousin Vytautas as the new Grand Duke. W\u0142adys\u0142aw II initially served as King of Poland alongside his wife Jadwiga until her death in 1399, and then the sole ruler until his own death in 1434.\nRaised a Lithuanian polytheist, he converted to Catholicism in 1386 and baptized as Ladislaus () in Krak\u00f3w, married the young Queen Jadwiga, and was crowned King of Poland as W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o. In 1387, he converted Lithuania to Catholicism. His reign in Poland started in 1399, upon the death of Queen Jadwiga, lasted a further thirty-five years, and laid the foundation for the centuries-long Polish\u2013Lithuanian union. He was a member of the Jagiellonian dynasty in Poland that bears his name and was previously also known as the Gediminid dynasty in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The dynasty ruled both states until 1572, and became one of the most influential dynasties in late medieval and early modern Europe.\nJogaila was the last pagan ruler of medieval Lithuania. After he became King of Poland, as a result of the Union of Krewo, the newly formed Polish-Lithuanian union confronted the growing power of the Teutonic Order. The allied victory at the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, followed by the Peace of Thorn, secured the Polish and Lithuanian borders and marked the emergence of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian alliance as a significant force in Europe. The reign of W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o extended Polish frontiers and is often considered the beginning of Poland's Golden Age.\nEarly life.\nLithuania.\nLittle is known of Jogaila's early life, and even his year of birth is uncertain. Previously historians assumed he was born in 1352, but some recent research suggests a later date\u2014about 1362. He was a descendant of the Gediminid dynasty and was the son of Algirdas, Grand Duke of Lithuania, and his second wife, Uliana of Tver, who was the daughter of the Yaroslavichi prince Aleksandr of Tver. His name had a meaning of more courageous and superior than others, he spent most of his early time in Vilnius, at his father's manor.\nThe Grand Duchy of Lithuania to which Jogaila succeeded as Grand Duke in 1377 was a political entity composed of two leading, but very different nationalities and two political systems: ethnic Lithuania in the north-west and the vast Ruthenian territories of former Kievan Rus', comprising the lands of modern Ukraine, Belarus, and parts of western Russia. At first, Jogaila\u2014like his father\u2014based his rule in the southern and eastern territories of Lithuania, while his uncle, K\u0119stutis, the Duke of Trakai, continued to rule the north-western region. Jogaila's succession, however, soon placed this system of dual rule under strain.\nAt the start of his reign, Jogaila was preoccupied with unrest in the Lithuanian Rus' lands. In 1377\u201378, Andrei of Polotsk, the eldest son of Algirdas, challenged Jogaila's authority and sought to become Grand Duke. In 1380, Andrei and another brother, Dmitry, sided with Prince Dmitri of Moscow against Jogaila's alliance with emir Mamai, de facto khan of the Golden Horde. Jogaila failed to support Mamai, lingering in the vicinity of the battlefield, which led to Mamai's army's significant defeat at the hands of Prince Dmitri in the Battle of Kulikovo. The Muscovites' Pyrrhic victory over the Golden Horde, in the long term, signified, however, the beginning of a slow climb to power by the Grand Duchy of Moscow, which became within a century the most serious rival and threat to the integrity, well-being and survival of Lithuania. However, in 1380 Muscovy was greatly weakened by tremendous losses suffered during the battle and thus, in the same year, Jogaila was free to begin a struggle for supremacy with K\u0119stutis.\nIn the north-west, Lithuania faced constant armed incursions from the Teutonic Knights\u2014founded after 1226 to fight and convert the pagan Baltic tribes of Prussians, Yotvingians and Lithuanians. In 1380, Jogaila concluded the secret Treaty of Dovydi\u0161k\u0117s, directed against K\u0119stutis. When K\u0119stutis discovered the plan, the Lithuanian Civil War began. He seized Vilnius, overthrew Jogaila, and pronounced himself grand duke in his place. In 1382, Jogaila raised an army from his father's vassals and confronted K\u0119stutis near Trakai. K\u0119stutis and his son Vytautas entered Jogaila's encampment for negotiations but were tricked and imprisoned in the Kreva Castle, where K\u0119stutis was found dead, probably murdered, a week later. Vytautas escaped to the Teutonic fortress of Marienburg and was baptised there under the name Wigand.\nJogaila formulated the Treaty of Dubysa, which rewarded the Knights for their aid in defeating K\u0119stutis and Vytautas by promising Christianisation and granting them Samogitia west of the Dubysa river. However, when Jogaila failed to ratify the treaty, the Knights invaded Lithuania in the summer of 1383. In 1384, Jogaila reconciled with Vytautas promising to return his patrimony in Trakai. Vytautas then turned against the Knights, attacking and looting several Prussian castles.\nIt is known that Jogaila, being ethnic Lithuanian in the male line, himself knew and spoke in the Lithuanian language with Vytautas, his cousin from the Gediminids dynasty. Also, during the Christianization of Samogitia, none of the clergy, who came to Samogitia with Jogaila, were able to communicate with the natives, therefore Jogaila himself taught the Samogitians about the Catholicism, thus he was able to communicate in the Samogitian dialect of the Lithuanian language. According to the Teutonic Order's testimonial, he could not read nor write, and had to listen to others reading for him.\nBaptism and marriage.\nJogaila's Russian mother Uliana of Tver urged him to marry Sofia, daughter of Prince Dmitri of Moscow, who required him first to convert to Orthodoxy. That option, however, was unlikely to halt the crusades against Lithuania by the Teutonic Knights, who regarded Orthodox Christians as schismatics and little better than heathens. Jogaila chose therefore to accept a Polish proposal to become a Catholic and marry the eleven-year-old Queen Jadwiga of Poland. The nobles of Lesser Poland made this offer to Jogaila for many reasons. They wanted to neutralize the dangers posed by Lithuania itself and to secure the fertile territories of Galicia\u2013Volhynia. The Polish nobles saw the offer as an opportunity for increasing their privileges and avoiding Austrian influence, brought by Jadwiga's previous fianc\u00e9 William, Duke of Austria.\nOn 14 August 1385 in Kreva Castle, Jogaila confirmed his prenuptial promises in the Union of Krewo (Union of Kreva). The promises included the adoption of Christianity, repatriation of lands \"stolen\" from Poland by its neighbours, and \"terras suas Lithuaniae et Russiae Coronae Regni Poloniae perpetuo applicare\", a clause interpreted by historians to mean anything from a personal union between Lithuania and Poland to a complete incorporation of Lithuania into Poland. The agreement at Kreva has been described both as far-sighted and as a desperate gamble.\nJogaila was duly baptized at the Wawel Cathedral in Krak\u00f3w on 15 February 1386 and from then on formally used the name W\u0142adys\u0142aw or Latin versions of it. The marriage took place three days later, and on 4 March 1386 Jogaila was crowned King W\u0142adys\u0142aw by archbishop Bodzanta. He was also to be legally adopted by Jadwiga's mother, Elizabeth of Bosnia, so retaining the throne in the event of Jadwiga's death. He was the first Lithuanian to be crowned as the King of Poland. The royal baptism triggered the conversion of most of Jogaila's court and noblemen, as well as mass baptisms in Lithuanian rivers, a beginning of the final Christianization of Lithuania. Though the ethnic Lithuanian nobility were the main converts to Catholicism\u2014both paganism and the Orthodox rite remained strong among the peasants\u2014the king's conversion and its political implications created lasting repercussions for the history of both Lithuania and Poland. On 22 February 1387, he banned Catholics from marriages with Orthodox and demanded those Orthodox who previously married with the Catholics to convert to Catholicism.\nRuler of Lithuania and Poland.\nAccession.\nW\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagiello and Jadwiga reigned as co-monarchs; and though Jadwiga probably had little real power, she took an active part in Poland's political and cultural life. In 1387, she led two successful military expeditions to Red Ruthenia, recovered lands her father, Louis I of Hungary, had transferred from Poland to Hungary, and secured the homage of Voivode Petru I of Moldavia. In 1390, she also personally opened negotiations with the Teutonic Order. Most political responsibilities, however, fell to Jagiello, with Jadwiga attending to the cultural and charitable activities for which she is still revered.\nSoon after Jagiello acceded to the Polish throne, Jagiello granted Vilnius a city charter like that of Krak\u00f3w, modelled on the Magdeburg Law; and Vytautas issued a privilege to a Jewish commune of Trakai on almost the same terms as privileges issued to the Jews of Poland in the reigns of Boleslaus the Pious and Casimir the Great. W\u0142adys\u0142aw's policy of unifying the two legal systems was partial and uneven at first but achieved a lasting influence. By the time of the Union of Lublin in 1569, there was not much difference between the administrative and judicial systems in force in Lithuania and Poland.\nOne effect of Jagiello's measures was to be the advancement of Catholics in Lithuania at the expense of Orthodox elements; in 1387 and 1413, for example, Lithuanian Catholic boyars were granted special judicial and political privileges denied to the Orthodox boyars. As this process gained momentum, it was accompanied by the rise of both Rus' and Lithuanian identity in the fifteenth century.\nChallenges.\nJagiello's baptism failed to end the crusade of the Teutonic Knights, who claimed his conversion was a sham, perhaps even heresy, and renewed their incursions on the pretext that pagans remained in Lithuania. From then on, however, the Order found it harder to sustain the cause of a crusade and faced the growing threat to its existence posed by the Kingdom of Poland and a genuinely Christian Lithuania alliance. W\u0142adys\u0142aw sponsored the creation of the diocese of Vilnius under bishop Andrzej Wasilko, the former confessor of Elizabeth of Poland. The bishopric, which included Samogitia, then largely controlled by the Teutonic Order, was subordinated to the see of Gniezno and not to that of Teutonic K\u00f6nigsberg. The decision may not have improved W\u0142adys\u0142aw's relations with the Order, but it served to introduce closer ties between Lithuania and Poland, enabling the Polish church to freely assist its Lithuanian counterpart.\nIn 1389, W\u0142adys\u0142aw's rule in Lithuania faced a revived challenge from Vytautas, who resented the power given to Skirgaila in Lithuania at the expense of his own patrimony. Vytautas started a civil war in Lithuania, aiming to become the Grand Duke. On 4 September 1390, the joint forces of Vytautas and Grand Master Konrad von Wallenrode of the Teutonic Order, laid siege to Vilnius, which was held by W\u0142adys\u0142aw's regent Skirgaila with combined Polish, Lithuanian and Ruthenian troops. Although the Knights lifted the siege of the castle after a month, they reduced much of the outer city to ruins. This bloody conflict was eventually brought to a temporary halt in 1392 with the Treaty of Ostr\u00f3w, by which W\u0142adys\u0142aw handed over the government of Lithuania to his cousin in exchange for peace: Vytautas was to rule Lithuania as the grand duke (\"magnus dux\") until his death, under the overlordship of the Supreme Duke (\"dux supremus\") in the person of the Polish monarch. Skirgaila was moved from the Duchy of Trakai to become prince of Kiev. Vytautas initially accepted his status but soon began to pursue Lithuania's independence from Poland.\nThe protracted period of war between the Lithuanians and the Teutonic Knights was ended on 12 October 1398 by the Treaty of Salynas, named after the islet in the Neman River where it was signed. Lithuania agreed to cede Samogitia and assist the Teutonic Order in a campaign to seize Pskov, while the Order agreed to assist Lithuania in a campaign to seize Novgorod. Shortly afterwards, Vytautas was crowned as a king by local nobles; but the following year his forces and those of his ally, Khan Tokhtamysh of the White Horde, were crushed by the Timurids at the Battle of the Vorskla River, ending his imperial ambitions in the east and obliging him to submit to W\u0142adys\u0142aw's protection once more.\nKing of Poland.\nEarly actions.\nOn 22 June 1399, Jadwiga gave birth to a daughter, baptised Elizabeth Bonifacia, but within a month the mother and daughter died, leaving W\u0142adys\u0142aw sole ruler of the Kingdom of Poland and without an heir nor much legitimacy to rule the kingdom. Jadwiga's death undermined W\u0142adys\u0142aw's right to the throne, and as a result old conflicts between the nobility of Lesser Poland, generally sympathetic to W\u0142adys\u0142aw, and the gentry of Greater Poland began to surface. In 1402, W\u0142adys\u0142aw answered the rumblings against his rule by marrying Anna of Cilli, a granddaughter of Casimir III of Poland, a political match that re-legitimized his reign.\nThe Union of Vilnius and Radom of 1401 confirmed the status of Vytautas as grand duke under W\u0142adys\u0142aw's overlordship while assuring the title of grand duke to the heirs of W\u0142adys\u0142aw rather than those of Vytautas: should W\u0142adys\u0142aw die without heirs, the Lithuanian boyars were to elect a new monarch. Since no heir had yet been produced by either monarch, the implications of the union were unforeseeable, but it forged bonds between the Polish and Lithuanian nobility and a permanent defensive alliance between the two states, strengthening Lithuania's hand for a new war against the Teutonic Order in which Poland officially took no part. While the document left the liberties of the Polish nobles untouched, it granted increased power to the boyars of Lithuania, whose grand dukes had till then been unencumbered by checks and balances of the sort attached to the Polish monarchy. The Union of Vilnius and Radom therefore earned W\u0142adys\u0142aw a measure of support in Lithuania.\nIn late 1401, the new war against the Order overstretched the resources of the Lithuanians, who found themselves fighting on two fronts after uprisings in the eastern provinces. Another of W\u0142adys\u0142aw's brothers, the malcontent \u0160vitrigaila, chose this moment to stir up revolts behind the lines and declare himself grand duke. On 31 January 1402, he presented himself in Marienburg, where he won the backing of the Knights with concessions similar to those made by Jogaila and Vytautas during earlier leadership contests in the Grand Duchy.\nAgainst the Teutonic Order.\nThe war ended in the Treaty of Raci\u0105\u017c on 22 May 1404. W\u0142adys\u0142aw acceded to the formal cession of Samogitia and agreed to support the Order's designs on Pskov; in return, Konrad von Jungingen undertook to sell Poland the disputed Dobrzy\u0144 Land and the town of Z\u0142otoryja, once pawned to the Order by W\u0142adys\u0142aw Opolski, and to support Vytautas in a revived attempt on Novgorod. Both sides had practical reasons for signing the treaty at that point: the Order needed time to fortify its newly acquired lands, the Poles and Lithuanians to deal with territorial challenges in the east and in Silesia.\nAlso in 1404, W\u0142adys\u0142aw held talks at Vratislav with Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia, who offered to return Silesia to Poland if W\u0142adys\u0142aw supported him in his power struggle within the Holy Roman Empire. W\u0142adys\u0142aw turned the deal down with the agreement of both Polish and Silesian nobles, unwilling to burden himself with new military commitments in the west.\nPolish\u2013Lithuanian\u2013Teutonic war.\nIn December 1408, W\u0142adys\u0142aw and Vytautas held strategic talks in Navahrudak Castle, where they decided to foment a Samogitian uprising against Teutonic rule to draw German forces away from Pomerelia. W\u0142adys\u0142aw promised to repay Vytautas for his support by restoring Samogitia to Lithuania in any future peace treaty. The uprising, which began in May 1409, at first provoked little reaction from the Knights, who had not yet consolidated their rule in Samogitia by building castles; but by June their diplomats were busy lobbying W\u0142adys\u0142aw's court at Oborniki, warning his nobles against Polish involvement in a war between Lithuania and the Order. W\u0142adys\u0142aw, however, bypassed his nobles and informed the new Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen that if the Knights acted to suppress Samogitia, Poland would intervene. This stung the Order into issuing a declaration of war against Poland on 6 August, which W\u0142adys\u0142aw received on 14 August in Nowy Korczyn.\nThe castles guarding the northern border were in such bad condition that the Knights easily captured those at Z\u0142otoryja, Dobrzy\u0144 and Bobrowniki, the capital of Dobrzy\u0144 Land, while German burghers invited them into Bydgoszcz (German: Bromberg). W\u0142adys\u0142aw arrived on the scene in late September, retook Bydgoszcz within a week, and came to terms with the Order on 8 October. During the winter, the two armies prepared for a major confrontation. W\u0142adys\u0142aw installed a strategic supply depot at P\u0142ock in Masovia and had a pontoon bridge constructed and transported north down the Vistula.\nMeanwhile, both sides unleashed diplomatic offensives. The Knights dispatched letters to the monarchs of Europe, preaching their usual crusade against the heathens; W\u0142adys\u0142aw countered with his letters to the monarchs, accusing the Order of planning to conquer the whole world. Such appeals successfully recruited many foreign knights to each side. Wenceslas IV of Bohemia signed a defensive treaty with the Poles against the Teutonic Order; his brother, Sigismund of Luxembourg, allied himself with the Order and declared war against Poland on 12 July, though his Hungarian vassals refused his call to arms.\nBattle of Grunwald.\nWhen the war resumed in June 1410, W\u0142adys\u0142aw advanced into the Teutonic heartland at the head of an army of about 20,000 mounted nobles, 15,000 armed commoners, and 2,000 professional cavalry mainly hired from Bohemia. After crossing the Vistula over the pontoon bridge at Czerwi\u0144sk, his troops met up with those of Vytautas, whose 11,000 light cavalry included Lithuanians, Ruthenians, and Tatars. The Teutonic Order's army had about 18,000 cavalry, mostly Germans, and 5,000 infantry. On 15 July, at the Battle of Grunwald after one of the largest and most ferocious battles of the Middle Ages, the allies won a victory so overwhelming that the Teutonic Order's army was virtually annihilated, with most of its key commanders killed in combat, including Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen and Grand Marshal Friedrich von Wallenrode. Thousands of troops were reportedly slaughtered on either side.\nThe road to the Teutonic capital Marienburg now lay open, the city undefended; but for reasons the sources do not explain, W\u0142adys\u0142aw hesitated to pursue his advantage. On 17 July, his army began a laboured advance, arriving at Marienburg only on 25 July, by which time the new Grand Master, Heinrich von Plauen, had organised a defence of the fortress. The apparent half-heartedness of the ensuing siege, called off by W\u0142adys\u0142aw on 19 September, has been variously ascribed to the impregnability of the fortifications, high Lithuanian casualties, to W\u0142adys\u0142aw's unwillingness to risk further casualties, or to his desire to keep the Order weakened but undefeated so as to not upset the balance of power between Poland (which would most likely acquire most of the Order possessions if it was totally defeated) and Lithuania; but a lack of sources precludes a definitive explanation.\nDissent.\nThe war ended in 1411 with the Peace of Thorn, in which neither Poland nor Lithuania drove home negotiating advantages home to the full, much to the discontent of the Polish nobility. Poland regained Dobrzy\u0144 Land, Lithuania regained Samogitia, and Masovia regained a small territory beyond the Wkra river. Most of the Teutonic Order's territory, however, including towns that had surrendered, remained intact. W\u0142adys\u0142aw then released many high-ranking Teutonic Knights and officials for apparently modest ransoms. The cumulative expense of the ransoms, however, proved a drain on the Order's resources. This failure to exploit the victory to his nobles' satisfaction provoked growing opposition to W\u0142adys\u0142aw's regime after 1411, further fueled by the granting of Podolia, disputed between Poland and Lithuania, to Vytautas, and by the king's two-year absence in Lithuania.\nIn an effort to outflank his critics, W\u0142adys\u0142aw promoted the leader of the opposing faction, bishop Miko\u0142aj Tr\u0105ba, to the archbishopric of Gniezno in autumn 1411 and replaced him in Krak\u00f3w with Vytautas supporter Wojciech Jastrz\u0119biec. He also sought to create more allies in Lithuania. The Union of Horod\u0142o on 2 October 1413 decreed that the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was \"tied to our Kingdom of Poland permanently and irreversibly\", and granted the Catholic nobles of Lithuania privileges equal to those of Polish szlachta. The act included a clause prohibiting the Polish nobility from electing a monarch without the consent of the Lithuanian nobility, and the Lithuanian nobility from electing a grand duke without the consent of the Polish monarch.\nLast conflicts.\nIn 1414, a sporadic new war broke out, known as the \"Hunger War\" from the Knights' scorched-earth tactics of burning fields and mills; but both the Knights and the Lithuanians were too exhausted from the previous war to risk a major battle, and the fighting petered out in the autumn. Hostilities did not flare up again until 1419, during the Council of Constance, when they were called off at the papal legate's insistence.\nThe Council of Constance proved a turning point in the Teutonic crusades, as it did for several European conflicts. Vytautas sent a delegation in 1415, including the metropolitan of Kiev and Samogitian witnesses; they arrived at Constance at the end of that year to express their preference for being \"baptised with water and not with blood\". The Polish envoys, among them Miko\u0142aj Tr\u0105ba, Zawisza Czarny, and Pawe\u0142 W\u0142odkowic, lobbied for an end to the forced conversion of heathens and to the Order's aggression against Lithuania and Poland. As a result of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian diplomacy, the council, though scandalised by W\u0142odkowic's questioning of the legitimacy of the monastic state, denied the Order's request for a further crusade and instead entrusted the conversion of the Samogitians to Poland\u2013Lithuania.\nThe diplomatic context at Constance included the revolt of the Bohemian Hussites, who looked upon Poland as an ally in their wars against Sigismund, the emperor elect and new king of Bohemia. In 1421, the Bohemian Diet declared Sigismund deposed and formally offered the crown to W\u0142adys\u0142aw on condition that he accept the religious principles of the Four Articles of Prague, which he was not prepared to do. After W\u0142adys\u0142aw's refusal, Vytautas was postulated (elected in absentia) as Bohemian king, but he assured the pope that he opposed the heretics. Between 1422 and 1428, W\u0142adys\u0142aw's nephew, Sigismund Korybut, attempted a regency in war-torn Bohemia, with little success. Vytautas accepted Sigismund's offer of a royal crown in 1429\u2014apparently with W\u0142adys\u0142aw's blessing\u2014but Polish forces intercepted the crown in transit and the coronation was cancelled.\nIn 1422, W\u0142adys\u0142aw fought another war, known as the Gollub War, against the Teutonic Order, defeating them in under two months before the Order's imperial reinforcements had time to arrive. The resulting Treaty of Melno ended the Knights' claims to Samogitia once and for all and defined a permanent border between Prussia and Lithuania. Lithuania was given the province of Samogitia, with the port of Palanga, but the city of Klaip\u0117da was left to the Order. This border remained largely unchanged for roughly 500 years, until 1920. The terms of this treaty have, however, been seen as turning a Polish victory into defeat, as a result of W\u0142adys\u0142aw's renunciation of Polish claims to Pomerania, Pomerelia, and Che\u0142mno Land, for which he received only the town of Nieszawa in return. The Treaty of Melno closed a chapter in the Knights' wars with Lithuania but did little to settle their long-term issues with Poland. Further sporadic warfare broke out between Poland and the Knights between 1431 and 1435.\nCracks in the cooperation between Poland and Lithuania after the death of Vytautas in 1430 had offered the Knights a revived opportunity for interference in Poland. W\u0142adys\u0142aw supported his brother \u0160vitrigaila as grand duke of Lithuania, but when \u0160vitrigaila, with the support of the Teutonic Order and dissatisfied Rus' nobles, rebelled against Polish overlordship in Lithuania, the Poles, under the leadership of Bishop Zbigniew Ole\u015bnicki of Krak\u00f3w, occupied Podolia, which W\u0142adys\u0142aw had awarded to Lithuania in 1411, and Volhynia. In 1432, a pro-Polish party in Lithuania elected Vytautas's brother \u017dygimantas as grand duke, leading to an armed struggle over the Lithuanian succession which stuttered on for years after W\u0142adys\u0142aw's death.\nSuccession and death.\nAt the dying request of the childless Jadwiga, he married a Styrian lady, Anna of Celje. She died in 1416, leaving a daughter: \nIn 1417, W\u0142adys\u0142aw married Elisabeth of Pilica, who died in 1420 without bearing him a child.&lt;br&gt; \nTwo years later, he married Sophia of Halshany (niece of Uliana Olshanska), who bore him two surviving sons : \nThe death in 1431 of his daughter Hedwig (Jadwiga), the last heir of Piast blood, released W\u0142adys\u0142aw to make his sons by Sophia of Halshany his heirs, though he had to placate the Polish nobility with concessions to ensure their agreement since the monarchy was elective. In 1427 the Polish nobles had initiated an anti-Jagiellonian movement, seeking to have W\u0142adys\u0142aw and Casimir excluded from the Polish throne as they had no blood link to the previous ruling Polish dynasty, the Piasts.\nDuring an excursion into Przemy\u015bl Land in the 48th year of his reign, W\u0142adys\u0142aw caught a cold from which he was unable to recover. He finally died in Grodek in 1434, leaving Poland to his elder son, W\u0142adys\u0142aw III, and Lithuania to his younger, Casimir, both still minors at the time. The Lithuanian inheritance, however, could not be taken for granted. W\u0142adys\u0142aw's death ended the personal union between the two realms, and it was not clear what would take its place.\nLegacy.\nW\u0142adys\u0142aw is depicted on the obverse of the modernized 100 Polish z\u0142oty banknote.\nThe Jagie\u0142\u0142o Oak, an ancient tree in Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest, is named in honour of the fact that he initiated the tradition of royal hunting in the area.\nIn 2021, asteroid 2004 TP17 was officially named as Jogaila (the Lithuanian language variant of his name).\nFamily tree.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Family tree of Jogaila/W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagiello\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The SB was the chief foreign and domestic security organization in Poland from 1956 until the fall of communism in 1989.\nThe parent agency of SB, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, had been established in 1954, but the Ministry did not play a significant role until the winding-up of the Committee for Public Safety in 1956. \nHistory.\nThe post-World War II Ministry of Public Security (UB) was responsible for security, intelligence and counterintelligence. It controlled over 41,000 soldiers of the Internal Security Corps, 57,500 members of the Citizens' Militia, 32,000 Border Protection Forces, 10,000 prison officers and 125,000 members of the Volunteer Reserve Citizen Militia.\nAfter the 1954 defection to the West of J\u00f3zef \u015awiat\u0142o (born Izaak Fleischfarb), a high-ranking Ministry of Public Security officer instrumental in arresting Cardinal Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski, this Ministry of Public Security was abolished.\nIn December 1954, the Communist Party divided the old UB into two parts: the Committee for Public Security (\"Komitet do spraw Bezpiecze\u0144stwa Publicznego\", or KDSBP) and the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MSW). The former was a secret police responsible for internal and external intelligence and counterintelligence to fight underground movements and the influence of the Catholic Church. The MSW was responsible for administrative duties, and eventually controlled the Internal Security Corps, militia, border troops, prison guards and the Volunteer Reserve Citizen Militia.\n1956 reform.\nThe year 1956 brought change to Polish politics. Recently released from prison, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka became the first secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party. Reforms were made in the structure of state security. The Committee of Public Safety was abolished, and its duties were taken over by the MSW.\nThe introduction of Security Service to the Interior Ministry (which was already in the Polish public safety system since 1954), came as a result of directive number 00238/56 made by W\u0142adys\u0142aw Wicha on 29 November 1956. Wicha was a Polish communist and politician PZPR member and then the first Minister of Internal Affairs from 1954 to 1964. After that his directive, the MSW was the only security body in Poland.\nOfficers working in the Security Service were nicknamed \"SB-eks\" (S\u0142u\u017cba Bezpiecze\u0144stwa agents). SB also contracted individuals as secret collaborators ( or TW), who usually received money for the services rendered.\nTasks and organizational structure.\nThe tasks of the Security Service were identical to that of its predecessors (MBP, UB and KdsBP): to protect the communist system in the country (and beyond) through control and penetration into all structures of social life in Poland and abroad. The centrally-based MSW was divided into departments, bureaus, sections and directorates. The following was observed in the SB after the agency was founded:\n1981 SB Structure.\nThe SB was further reorganized in 1981 due to reforms made by Czes\u0142aw Kiszczak. This was made under Resolution No. 144 of the Council of Ministers of October 21, 1983 on granting the organizational statute to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, later amended by Resolution No. 128 of the Council of Ministers of August 22, 1989.\nRanks.\nThe following ranks were observed until 1990:\nActivities.\nAfter it was renamed the SB in 1956, it entered a period of relative inactivity during the era of reform instituted by W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka. However, after 1968 it was revived as a stronger body responsible for political repression, most notably of the Solidarity movement, the leader of which, Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa, was under constant SB surveillance. Throughout the martial law (1981-1983), SB played a key role in wiretapping telephones in public areas and institutions. It also participated in infiltrating Solidarity's committees and gatherings.\nThe torture and execution of Catholic priest Jerzy Popie\u0142uszko by SB members (who were later convicted of murder) in 1984 shook Poland. The agency is also suspected of killing Stanis\u0142aw Pyjas, Catholic priest Stefan Niedzielak, and is reported to have abused priest Roman Kotlarz, who died mysteriously after a beating.\nVictims.\nAn infamous case was the torture and execution by the SB of Catholic priest Jerzy Popie\u0142uszko in 1984. Since 1990, several SB operatives have been tried for their crimes. The SB is also suspected of killing Stanis\u0142aw Pyjas and Catholic priest Stefan Niedzielak. It is reported to have abused priest Roman Kotlarz, who died mysteriously after a beating.\nIn popular culture.\nThe SB is featured in the Polish TV series \"1983\" which is set in an alternative 2003 where Poland is still a communist country.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was constructed in 1988 by a consortium of companies led by AT&amp;T Corporation, France T\u00e9l\u00e9com, and British Telecom. AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories developed the technologies used in the cable. The system was made possible by opto-electric-opto regenerators acting as repeaters with advantages over the electrical repeaters of former cables. They were less costly and could be at greater spacing with less need for associated hardware and software. It was able to serve the three countries with a single transatlantic crossing with the use of an innovative branching unit located underwater on the continental shelf off the coast of Great Britain. The cable lands in Tuckerton, New Jersey, USA, Widemouth Bay, England, UK, and Penmarch, France.\nThe system was built at an initial cost of US$335 million in 1988 and was retired from service in 2002. Capacity was reached in eighteen months despite optimistic predictions that the capacity would not be filled for a decade and some that it would never be filled and no other cables would be needed.\nHistory.\nThis was the first transatlantic cable to use optical fibers, a revolution in telecommunications. The system contained two working pairs of optical fibers; a third fiber pair (in the AT&amp;T segment only) was reserved as a span-wise spare. The signal on each optical fiber was modulated at 295.6\u00a0Mbit/s (carrying 280\u00a0Mbit/s of traffic) and fully regenerated in equipment placed in pressure housings separated by about 40\u00a0km of cable.\nThere were several problems with the early reliability of this cable during its first two years of operation. The cable was buried on the continental shelf on the European and the American side of the ocean. The burial was largely effective, and the cable issues were primarily related to manufacturing defects. AT&amp;T laid a trial optical cable in the Canary Islands in 1985. This cable did not have an electrical screen and was attacked by sharks. It was never proved whether these attacks were due to the sharks sensing the electrical radiation from the cable or the vibration of the cable moving on the sea floor where it might have been suspended, or a combination of both. TAT-8 did not have the screen conductor over the vast majority of its length, as the threat of shark attack was deemed to be small over the majority of the route. Because the Canary Island cable was the first fiber-optic cable and not a coaxial cable, the electrical interference shielding for the high voltage supply lines was removed. This removal did not affect the fiber, but it did cause feeding frenzies in sharks that swam nearby. The sharks would then attack the cable until the voltage lines killed them. This caused numerous, prolonged outages. Eventually, a shark shielding was developed for the cable and was available for TAT-8. PTAT-1, the next cable to go in the Atlantic was put in with the shark shielding across its entire length; the added reliability provided by this shield has not been fully evaluated.\nThe system was manufactured by a consortium of three established submarine system suppliers: AT&amp;T, Standard Telephones and Cables and Alcatel. The idea was that each manufacturer would manufacture part of the system, so French technology procured by France T\u00e9l\u00e9com would land in France, US technology in America procured by AT&amp;T and British technology procured by BT in the UK. The systems were designed to interoperate although the regenerator supervisory systems were all proprietary. The transition between one supplier to another supplier's regenerators was achieved using a \"mid-span meet\". AT&amp;T was appointed the integration coordinator and integration trials were held in Freehold, New Jersey.\nImpact.\nIn 1989, with the new available capacity due to the TAT-8 cable, IBM agreed to fund a dedicated T1 link between Cornell University and CERN, which was completed in February 1990. It greatly increased the connectivity between the American and European portions of the early Internet. This allowed Tim Berners-Lee a high-speed, direct and open connection to the NSFNET, which greatly aided the first demonstrations of the World Wide Web ten months later. It was also crucial, along with the collapse of the Warsaw Pact at the same time, to the acceptance of TCP/IP protocols in Europe.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

With around 283,000 inhabitants, it is Germany's 24th-largest city. Wiesbaden forms a conurbation with a population of around 500,000 with the neighbouring city of Mainz. This conurbation is in turn embedded in the Rhine-Main Metropolitan Region\u2014Germany's second-largest metropolitan region after Rhine-Ruhr\u2014which also includes the nearby cities of Frankfurt am Main, Darmstadt, Offenbach am Main, and Hanau, and has a combined population exceeding 5.8 million.\nThe city is located on the Rhine (Upper Rhine), at the foothills of the Taunus, opposite the Rhineland-Palatine capital of Mainz, and the city centre is located in the wide valley of the small Salzbach stream. Wiesbaden lies in the Rheingau wine-growing region, one of Germany's 13 wine regions. Three of Wiesbaden's boroughs were part of the city of Mainz until 1945, and still bear the designation \"Mainz\" in their names\u2014the so-called AKK-boroughs of Mainz-Am\u00f6neburg, Mainz-Kastel, and Mainz-Kostheim. This so-called AKK-Konflikt () is the main cause for the rivalry between Mainz and Wiesbaden. Wiesbaden Main Station is connected to Frankfurt am Main by the Rhine-Main S-Bahn rapid transit system.\nHistorically, Wiesbaden was a Nassauian city. From 1170 to 1629, it lay in the County of Nassau, and from 1629 to 1721, it was in the county and later principality of Nassau-Idstein, all of which were territories within the Holy Roman Empire ruled by branches of the House of Nassau. In 1728, the city found itself in the principality of Nassau-Usingen, and in 1744, Biebrich Palace became the main residence of the House of Nassau-Usingen. In 1806, the city became the capital of the Duchy of Nassau. Since 1841, the newly built Wiesbaden City Palace was the principal Nassauian residence. From 1868 to 1944, the city lay in the Prussian Province of Hesse-Nassau, and from 1944 to 1945, it was the capital of the Province of Nassau. In 1945, it became the capital of Greater Hesse and subsequently, in 1946, of Hesse.\nWiesbaden is one of the oldest spa towns in Europe. Its name translates to \"meadow baths\", and there are 15 mineral springs\u201414 of which are hot springs\u2014in the city centre. With a yield of around 2 million liters daily, Wiesbaden is the second-most productive German spa after Aachen. Its location in a mountain basin at the southern foot of the Taunus, protected by the mountains in the north and west, gives Wiesbaden a mild climate. It has been called the \"Nice of the North\" because of its climate and architecture. The city of Wiesbaden is one of the wealthiest cities in Germany and one of those with above-average purchasing power. The United States Army Europe and Africa headquarters are located in Wiesbaden-Erbenheim.\nGeography.\nWiesbaden is situated on the right (northern) bank of the Rhine, above the confluence of the Main, where the Rhine's main direction changes from north to west. The city is across the Rhine from Mainz, the capital of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Frankfurt am Main is located about east. To the north of the city are the Taunus Mountains, which trend in a northeasterly direction.\nThe city center, the \"Stadtmitte\", is located in the north-easternmost part of the Upper Rhine Valley at the spurs of the Taunus mountains, about from the Rhine. The landscape is formed by a wide lowland between the Taunus heights in the north, the Bierstadter H\u00f6he and the Hainerberg in the east, the Mosbacher Mountain in the south, and the Schiersteiner Mountain in the west, an offshoot of the Taunus range.\nThe downtown is drained only by the narrow valley of the Salzbach, a tributary of the Rhine, on the eastern flanks of the Mosbacher Mountain. The city's main railway line and the Mainz road (\"Mainzer Stra\u00dfe\") follow this valley. Several other streams drain into the Salzbach within the city center: the Wellritzbach, the Kesselbach, the Schwarzbach, the Dambach, and the Tennelbach, as well as the outflow of many thermal and mineral springs in the \"Kurhaus\" (spa) district. Above the city center, the Salzbach is better known as the Rambach.\nThe highest point of the Wiesbaden municipality is located northwest of the city center near the summit of the Hohe Wurzel, with an elevation of above sea level. The lowest point is the harbour entrance of Schierstein at above sea level. The central square (the \"Schlossplatz\", or palace square) is at an elevation of .\nWiesbaden covers an area of . It is from north to south and from west to east. In the north are vast forest areas, which cover 27.4% of the urban area. In the west and east are vineyards and agricultural land, which cover 31.1% of the area. Of the municipality's border, the Rhine makes up .\nClimate.\nWiesbaden has a temperate-oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Cfb\"; Trewartha: \"Dobk\") with relatively cold winters and warm summers. Its average annual temperature is , with monthly mean temperatures ranging from in January to in July.\nThe Wiesbaden weather station has recorded the following extreme values:\nHistory.\nClassical antiquity.\nWhile evidence of settlement at present-day Wiesbaden dates back to the Neolithic era, historical records document continuous occupancy after the erection of a Roman fort in 6\u00a0AD which housed an auxiliary cavalry unit. The thermal springs of Wiesbaden are first mentioned in Pliny the Elder's \"Naturalis Historia\". They were famous for their recreation pools for Roman army horses and possibly as the source of a mineral used for red hair dye (which was very fashionable around the turn of BC/AD among women in Rome).\nThe Roman settlement is first mentioned using the name \"Aquae Mattiacorum\" (Latin for \"Waters of the Mattiaci\") in 121. The Mattiaci were a Germanic tribe, possibly a branch of the neighboring Chatti, who lived in the vicinity at that time. The town also appears as Mattiacum in Ptolemy's Geographia (2.10). The Roman Empire built the Limes Germanicus, which was a line of Roman frontier fortifications in the Taunus. Wiesbaden is just south of the Taunus.\nThe capital of the province of Germania Superior, Mogontiacum (present-day Mainz), base of 2 (at times 3) Roman legions, was just over the Rhine and connected by a bridge at the present-day borough of Mainz-Kastel (Roman \"castellum\"), a strongly fortified bridgehead.\nThe Alamanni, a coalition of Germanic tribes from beyond the \"Limes\", captured the fort around 260. Later, in the 370s, when the Romans and Alamanni were allied, the Alemanni gained control of the Wiesbaden area and were in charge of its defense against other Germanic tribes.\nMiddle Ages.\nAfter the Franks under Clovis I defeated the Alamanni in the Battle of Tolbiac in 496, the Franks eventually displaced the Alamanni in the Wiesbaden area over the course of the 6th century. In the 8th century, Wiesbaden became the site of a royal palace of the Frankish kingdom. The first documented use of the name Wiesbaden is by Einhard, the biographer of Charlemagne, whose writings mention \"Wisabada\" sometime between 828 and 830.\nWhen the Frankish Carolingian Empire broke up in 888, Wiesbaden was in the eastern half, called East Francia (which would evolve into the Holy Roman Empire). The town was part of Franconia, the heartland of East Francia. In the 1170s, the Count of Nassau, Walram I, received the area around Wiesbaden as a fiefdom. When Franconia fragmented in the early 13th century, Nassau emerged as an independent state as part of the Holy Roman Empire.\nIn 1232 Wiesbaden became a Reichsstadt, an imperial city, of the Holy Roman Empire. However, in 1242, during the war of Emperor Frederick II against the Pope, the Archbishop of Mainz, Siegfried III, ordered the city's destruction.\nWiesbaden returned to the control of the House of Nassau in 1270 under Count Walram II, Count of Nassau. However, Wiesbaden and the castle at Sonnenberg were again destroyed in 1283 in conflict with Eppstein.\nWalram's son and successor Adolf would later become king of Germany from 1292 until 1298. In 1329, under Adolf's son Gerlach I of Nassau-Weilburg the House of Nassau and thereby, Wiesbaden, received the right of coinage from Holy Roman Emperor Louis the Bavarian.\nIn 1355, the County of Nassau-Weilburg was divided among the sons of Gerlach. The County of Nassau's holdings would be subdivided many times among heirs, with the parts being brought together again whenever a line died out. Wiesbaden became the seat of the County of Nassau-Wiesbaden under Count Adolf I (1307\u20131370), eldest son of Gerlach. It would eventually fall back to Nassau-Weilburg in 1605.\nModern era.\nDue to its participation in the uprisings of the German Peasants' War of 1525, Wiesbaden lost all its privileges for over 40 years. During this time, Wiesbaden became Protestant with the nomination of Wolf Denthener as first Lutheran pastor on 1 January 1543. The same day, the first Latin school was opened, preparing pupils for the gymnasium in Idstein. In 1566, the privileges of the city were restored.\nThe oldest remaining building of Wiesbaden, the old city hall, was built in 1609 and 1610. No older buildings are preserved due to two fires in 1547 and 1561. In 1648, at the end of the devastating Thirty Years' War, chronicles tell that Wiesbaden had barely 40 residents left. In 1659, the County of Nassau-Weilburg was divided again. Wiesbaden became part of the County of Nassau-Usingen. In 1744, the seat of Nassau-Usingen was moved to Biebrich. In 1771, the Count of Nassau-Usingen granted a concession for gambling in Wiesbaden. In 1810, the Wiesbaden Casino (German: \"Spielbank\") was opened in the old Kurhaus. Gambling was later outlawed by Prussian authorities in 1872.\nAs a result of Napoleon's victory over Austria in the Battle of Austerlitz, the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved in 1805. On 12 July 1806, 16 states in present-day Germany, including the remaining counties of Nassau-Usingen and Nassau-Weilburg, formally left the Holy Roman Empire and joined in the Confederation of the Rhine. Napoleon was its \"protector\". Under pressure from Napoleon, both counties merged to form the Duchy of Nassau on 30 August 1806.\nAt the 1815 Congress of Vienna, the Duchy of Nassau joined the German Confederation. The capital of Nassau was moved from Weilburg to Wiesbaden, and the city became the ducal residence. Building activity started to give the city a magnificent appearance. Most of the historical center of Wiesbaden dates back to this time.\nIn the Revolutions of 1848, 30,000 citizens of Nassau assembled in Wiesbaden on 4 March. They demanded a constitution from the Duke, which they received.\nIn the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, Nassau took Austria's side. This decision led to the end of the duchy. After the Austrian defeat, Nassau was annexed by Prussia and became part of the Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau. The deposed duke Adolph of Nassau in 1890 became the Grand Duke of Luxembourg (see House of Nassau). This turned out to be a fortunate change for the city, as it then became an international spa town. A rise in construction commenced after the aristocracy followed the lead of the Hohenzollern emperors, who began annual trips to Wiesbaden.\nThe period around the turn of the 20th century is regarded as the heyday of the city. Kaiser Wilhelm II visited the city regularly in summer, such that it became an unofficial \"summer residence\". The city was also popular among the Russian nobility. In the wake of the imperial court, numerous nobles, artists, and wealthy businessmen increasingly settled in the city. Many wealthy persons chose Wiesbaden as their retirement seat, as it offered leisure and medical treatment alike. In the latter part of the 19th century, Wiesbaden became the German city with the most millionaires.\nIn 1894, the present Hessian State Theater, designed by the Vienna architects Fellner and Helmer, was built on behalf of Kaiser Wilhelm II.\nWeimar Republic and Third Reich (1919 to 1945).\nAfter World War I, Wiesbaden fell under the Allied occupation of the Rhineland and was occupied by the French army in 1918. In 1921, the Wiesbaden Agreement on German reparations to France was signed in the city. In 1925, Wiesbaden became the headquarters of the British Army of the Rhine until the withdrawal of occupying forces from the Rhineland in 1930.\nIn 1929, an airport was constructed in Erbenheim on the site of a horse-racing track. In 1936, Fighter Squadron 53 of the Luftwaffe was stationed here.\nIn the Kristallnacht pogrom on 10 November 1938, Wiesbaden's large synagogue on Michelsberg was destroyed. The synagogue had been designed by Phillip Hoffmann and built in 1869. Another synagogue in Wiesbaden-Bierstadt was also destroyed. When the Nazis came to power in Germany, there were 2,700 Jews living in Wiesbaden. By June 1942 nearly all of them had been deported to the extermination camps in German-occupied Poland.\nGeneral Ludwig Beck from Wiesbaden was one of the planners of the 20 July 1944 assassination attempt of Adolf Hitler. Beck was designated by his fellow conspirators to be future Head of State (Regent) after the elimination of Hitler. The plot failed, however, and Beck was forced to commit suicide. Today, the city annually awards the Ludwig Beck prize for civil courage in his honor.\nLutheran pastor and theologian Martin Niem\u00f6ller, founder of the Confessing Church resistance movement against the Nazis, was an Honorary Citizen of Wiesbaden. He presented his last sermon before his arrest in Wiesbaden's Market Church.\nWorld War II.\nIn World War II, Wiesbaden was the headquarters for Germany's Wehrkreis XII. This military district included the Eifel, part of Hesse, the Palatinate, and the Saarland. After the Battle of France, this \"Wehrkreis\" was extended to include Lorraine, including Nancy, and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. The commander was \"General der Infanterie\" Walther Schroth.\n\"Wehrkreis\" XII was made up of three subordinate regions: \"Bereich Hauptsitze\" Koblenz, Mannheim and Metz.\nDuring the war, Wiesbaden was, between August 1940 and the end of 1942, bombed by the Royal Air Force and from 1943 through to March 1945, was attacked by both RAF and United States Air Force bombers on 66 days. In the attacks, about 18% of the city's homes were destroyed. During the war, more than 25% of the city's buildings were damaged or worse and 1,700 people were killed.\nWiesbaden was the location of a camp for Sinti and Romani people (see \"Romani Holocaust\"), and two subcamps of the Hinzert concentration camp, mostly for Luxembourgish prisoners.\nWiesbaden was captured by U.S. Army forces on 28 March 1945. The U.S. 317th Infantry Regiment attacked in assault boats across the Rhine from Mainz while the 319th Infantry attacked across the river Main near Hochheim am Main. The attack started at 01:00 and by early afternoon the two forces of the 80th U.S. Infantry Division had linked up with the loss of only three dead and three missing. The Americans captured 900 German soldiers and a warehouse full of 4,000 cases of champagne.\nAfter the war's end, American rock artist Elvis Presley was stationed in Friedberg and often visited Wiesbaden.\nCold War and contemporary history.\nAfter World War II, the state of Hesse was established (see Greater Hesse), and Wiesbaden became its capital, though nearby Frankfurt am Main is much larger and works as Hesse's economic and financial centre. Wiesbaden however suffered much less than Frankfurt from air bombing. There is a persistent rumour that the U.S. Army Air Force spared the town with the intention of turning it into a postwar HQ, but USAAF sources claim this to be a myth, arguing that Wiesbaden's economic and strategic importance simply did not justify more bombing. Wiesbaden was host to the Headquarters, U.S. Air Forces, Europe based at the former Lindsey Air Station from 1953 to 1973.\nAmerican armed forces have been present in Wiesbaden since World War II. The U.S. 1st Armored Division was headquartered at the Wiesbaden Army Airfield, just off the autobahn toward Frankfurt, until the Division completed relocation to Fort Bliss, Texas, in 2011. Wiesbaden is now home to the U.S. Army Europe Headquarters and the General John Shalikashvili Mission Command Center.\nIn 1962, the American artists George Maciunas, Dick Higgins and Alison Knowles traveled to Europe to promote a planned \"Fluxus\" publication with concerts of antique musical instruments, the \u201cFluxus Internationale Festspiele Neuester Music\u201d (Fluxus International Festival of Newest Music) at the Museum Wiesbaden. Fourteen concerts were performed on four weekends between 1 and 23 September which marked the beginning of the Fluxus movement. Work by musicians such as John Cage, Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti, Krzysztof Penderecki, Terry Riley, Brion Gysin and others were performed alongside new performance pieces written by Higgins, Knowles, George Brecht, Nam June Paik, Ben Patterson, Robert Filliou, Emmett Williams, and others. One performance in particular, \"Piano Activities\" by Philip Corner, became notorious by challenging the important status of the piano in post-war German homes.\nBathing and gambling.\nWiesbaden has long been famous for its thermal springs and spa. Use of the thermal springs was first documented by the Romans. The business of spring bathing became important for Wiesbaden near the end of the Middle Ages. By 1370, 16 bath houses were in operation. By 1800, the city had 2,239 inhabitants and 23 bath houses.\nBy 1900, Wiesbaden, with a population of 86,100, hosted 126,000 visitors annually. Famous visitors to the springs included Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Richard Wagner, Johannes Brahms, and Henrik Pontoppidan. In those years, more millionaires were living in Wiesbaden than in any other city in Germany.\nGambling followed bathing \"en suite\", and in the 19th century, Wiesbaden was famous for both. Its casino (\"Spielbank\") rivalled those of Bad Homburg, Baden-Baden, and Monaco. In 1872, the Prussian-dominated imperial government closed down all German gambling houses. The Wiesbaden casino was reopened in 1949.\nMain sights.\nThe Palace Square.\nThe \"Schlo\u00dfplatz\" (\"palace square\") is situated in the center of the city, surrounded by several outstanding buildings. The ducal palace was begun under William, Duke of Nassau. Its foundations were laid in 1837 and it was completed in November 1841 (two years after William's death). For the twenty-six remaining years of ducal authority it was the residence of the ruling family. It later served as a secondary residence for the King of Prussia 1866 to 1918. It was later used as a headquarters for French and British occupying forces after World War I, then as a museum.\nSince 1945, the building has served as Landtag (parliamentary building) for the state of Hesse. The site of the palace had been that of a castle, probably from the early Middle Ages, around which the city had developed. While nothing is known of the former castle, remains of it were uncovered during excavations after World War II.\nThe new town hall was built in 1887. A tile mosaic in front of the town hall shows the heraldic eagle of the Kingdom of Prussia (of which Wiesbaden was a part at the time), the coat of arms of the Prussian Province of Hesse-Nassau, and the fleur-de-lis of Wiesbaden. The old town hall, built in 1610, is the oldest preserved building in the city center and now is used as a civil registry office.\nThe Protestant \"Marktkirche\" (\"market church\") was built from 1852 to 1862 in a neo-Gothic style. Its western steeple is in height, making the church the highest building in the city.\nKurhaus and Theater.\nThe monumental Neo-Classical \"Kurhaus\" (\"spa house\") was built at the request of Kaiser Wilhelm II between 1904 and 1907. Its famous \"Spielbank\" (casino) is again in operation.\nIn front of the Kurhaus is a lawn known as the Bowling Green. To one side of the Bowling Green is the Kurhaus Kolonnade. Built in 1827, the 129 meter structure is the longest hall in Europe supported by pillars. To the other side is the Theater Kolonnade, built in 1839. It is adjacent to the Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden, built between 1892 and 1894.\nSt. Bonifatius.\nSt. Bonifatius, the first church for the Catholic community after the Reformation, was built from 1845 until 1849 by Philipp Hoffmann in Gothic Revival style and dedicated to Saint Boniface.\nSt. Elizabeth's Church.\nThe Russian Orthodox Church of Saint Elizabeth, called \"Griechische Kapelle\" (Greek chapel) locally, was built on the Neroberg from 1847 to 1855 by Duke Adolf of Nassau on the occasion of the early death of his wife Elizabeth Mikhailovna, who died in childbirth. The architect was again Philipp Hoffmann.\nMuseum Wiesbaden.\nOne of the several Hessian state museums, the Museum Wiesbaden is located in Wiesbaden.\nWarmer Damm park.\nThe Warmer Damm park is a 4.5 hectare park on the east side of Wilhelmstrasse and south of the State theater and Kurhaus which features a lake, a fountain, various statues, and large grassy areas. The park was created in 1859-1860 and is named after the medieval fortifications around a pond into which the warm waters of the town's 26 warm springs flowed.\nOther sights.\nAnother building from the regency of Duke Wilhelm is the Luisenplatz, a square named for the Duke's first wife. It is surrounded by Neoclassicist buildings, and in the middle of the square is the Waterloo Obelisk, commemorating the 683 Nassauers who died on 18 June 1815 near Hougoumont Farm in the respective battle against Napoleon. Apart from the palace in the center, the ducal family had a large palace on the banks of the Rhine, known as Schloss Biebrich. This baroque building was erected in the first half of the 18th century.\nNorth of the city is the Neroberg. From the top of this hill it is possible to view a panorama of the city. The Nerobergbahn funicular railway connects the city with the hill. South of it, the Nerotalanlagen are a park along a creek, created in 1897/98 as an English landscape garden.\nOther churches are the Bergkirche, completed in 1879 in Gothic Revival style, and the Lutherkirche, finished in 1910 in Jugendstil. The church Mari\u00e4 Heimsuchung is a tall concrete landmark in the Kohlheck suburb.\nOriental Christianity is also represented with the St. Isaiah Syriac Orthodox Church on the Willi-Juppe-Stra\u00dfe in Dotzheim, built in 2016 by Assyrians. Although the majority of Assyrians in Wiesbaden are Syriac Orthodox, the Assyrian Church of the East also has a congregation located in the city.\nBoroughs of Wiesbaden.\nThe city of Wiesbaden is divided into 26 boroughs: five in the central city and 21 suburban districts. The 21 suburban districts were incorporated in four phases from 1926 to 1977. The former Mainz suburbs on the right bank of river Rhine viz. Am\u00f6neburg, Kastel and Kostheim have belonged to Wiesbaden since 1945.\nPopulation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nWiesbaden has a population of about 280,000. In 1946, when Wiesbaden became the capital of Hesse state, it had a population of about 188,000. At that time, Wiesbaden was a part of American occupied zone and parts of the city of Mainz, which was the right side on the Rhine river, became a part of Wiesbaden. In 1950s many Americans came to Wiesbaden due to its jobs by military bases. Many people who work in Frankfurt live in Wiesbaden due to its high rent of the city. Wiesbaden is one of the most international cities in Germany with people from over 180 countries. \nList of largest groups of foreign residents of Wiesbaden:\nPolitics.\nMayor.\nThe current mayor of Wiesbaden is Gert-Uwe Mende of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), who was elected in 2019.\nThe most recent mayoral election was held on 26 May 2019, with a runoff held on 16 June, and the results were as follows:\nThe following is a list of mayors since 1945:\nCity council.\nThe administrative structure of Wiesbaden is based on the Hessian municipal code, as last amended in 2006. The Wiesbaden City Council (\"Stadtverordnetenversammlung\") governs the city alongside the Mayor. The most recent city council election was held on 14 March 2021. Following the election, the coalition negotiations resulted in an agreement between Alliance 90/The Greens (Gr\u00fcne), the Social Democratic Party (SPD), The Left, and Volt Germany. These 42 votes allowed the Greens, who came second in the popular vote, to keep the CDU, who had come in first, out of the governing majority. The full results of the election were as follows:\nTransport.\nRoads.\nWiesbaden is well connected to the German motorway (\"Autobahn\") system. The Wiesbadener Kreuz is an Autobahn interchange east of the city where the Bundesautobahn 3 (A 3), Cologne to W\u00fcrzburg, and the Bundesautobahn 66 (A 66), Rheingau to Fulda, meet. With approximately 210,000 cars daily it is one of the most heavily used interchange in Germany.

The airport also serves as a hub for Condor and as the main hub for German flag carrier Lufthansa. Depending on whether total passengers or flights are used, it ranks second or third busiest in Europe alongside London Heathrow Airport and Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport. Passenger traffic at Frankfurt Airport in 2011 was 56.5\u00a0million.\nThe airport can be reached by car or train and has two railway stations, one for regional and one for long-distance traffic.

In the story, Phileas Fogg of London and his newly employed French valet Passepartout attempt to circumnavigate the world in 80 days on a wager of \u00a320,000 (equivalent to \u00a3\u00a0million in 2023) set by his friends at the Reform Club. It is one of Verne's most acclaimed works.\nPlot.\nPhileas Fogg is a wealthy English gentleman living a solitary life in London. Despite his wealth, Fogg lives modestly and carries out his habits with mathematical precision. He is a member of the Reform Club, where he spends a large portion of his days and nights. On the morning of 2 October 1872, having dismissed his valet for bringing him shaving water at a temperature slightly lower than expected, Fogg hires Frenchman Jean Passepartout as a replacement.\nThat evening, while at the Club, Fogg gets involved in a discussion regarding an article in \"The Morning Chronicle\" (or \"The Daily Telegraph\" in some editions) stating that with the opening of a new railway section in India, it is now possible to travel around the world in 80 days. He accepts a wager for \u00a320,000, half of his fortune, from his fellow club members to complete such a journey within this period. With Passepartout accompanying him, Fogg departs from London by train at 8:45\u00a0p.m.; to win the wager, he must return to the club by this same time on 21 December, 80 days later. They take Fogg's remaining \u00a320,000 with them to cover expenses during the journey.\nFogg and Passepartout reach Suez on time. While disembarking in Egypt, they are watched by a Scotland Yard policeman, Detective Fix, who has been dispatched from London in search of James Strand, a bank robber. Since Fogg fits the vague description Scotland Yard was given of Strand, Detective Fix mistakes Fogg for the criminal. Since he cannot secure a warrant in time, Fix boards the steamer (the \"Mongolia\") conveying the travellers to Bombay. Fix becomes acquainted with Passepartout without revealing his purpose. Fogg promises the steamer engineer a large reward if he gets them to Bombay early. They arrive in Bombay on 20 October, two days ahead of schedule, and board a train heading towards Calcutta that evening.\nThe early arrival in Bombay proves beneficial for Fogg and Passepartout, as contrary to what the newspaper article had said, an stretch of track from Kholby to Allahabad has not yet been built. Fogg purchases an elephant, hires a guide and starts toward Allahabad.\nThey come across a procession in which a young Indian woman, Aouda, is about to be burned alive on her husband's funeral pyre. Since she is drugged with opium and hashish and is not going voluntarily, the travellers decide to rescue her. They follow the procession to the site, where Passepartout takes the place of her deceased husband on the funeral pyre. He rises from the pyre during the ceremony, scaring off the priests and carries Aouda away. The two days gained earlier are lost but Fogg shows no regret.\nFogg and Passepartout re-board the train at Allahabad, taking Aouda with them. When the travelers arrive in Calcutta, Fix, who had arrived ahead of them, has Fogg and Passepartout arrested for a crime Passepartout had committed in Bombay. They jump bail and board a steamer (the \"Rangoon\") going to Hong Kong, with a day's stopover in Singapore. Fix also boards the \"Rangoon\"; he shows himself to Passepartout, who is delighted to again meet his friend from the earlier voyage.\nIn Hong Kong, the group learns Aouda's distant relative, in whose care they had been planning to leave her, has moved to Holland, so they decide to take her with them to Europe. Still without a warrant, Fix sees Hong Kong as his last chance to arrest Fogg on British soil. Passepartout becomes convinced that Fix is a spy from the Reform Club. Fix confides in Passepartout, who does not believe a word and remains convinced that his master is not a robber. To prevent Passepartout from informing his master about the premature departure of their next vessel, the \"Carnatic\", Fix gets Passepartout drunk and drugs him in an opium den. Passepartout still manages to catch the steamer to Yokohama but cannot inform Fogg that the steamer is leaving the evening before its scheduled departure date.\nFogg discovers he missed his connection. He searches for a vessel that will take him to Yokohama, finding a pilot boat, the \"Tankadere\", that takes him, Aouda, and Fix to Shanghai, where they catch a steamer to Yokohama. There, they search for Passepartout, believing he arrived on the \"Carnatic\" as initially planned. They find him in a circus, trying to earn the fare for his homeward journey. Reunited, the four board a paddle-steamer, the \"General Grant\", taking them across the Pacific to San Francisco. Fix promises Passepartout that now, having left British soil, he will no longer try to delay Fogg's journey but instead support him in getting back to Britain, where he can arrest him.\nIn San Francisco, they board a transcontinental train to New York City, encountering several obstacles along the way: a herd of bison crossing the tracks, a failing suspension bridge and a band of Sioux warriors ambushing the train. After uncoupling the locomotive from the carriages, Passepartout is kidnapped by the warriors. Fogg rescues him after American soldiers volunteer to help. They continue by a wind-powered sled to Omaha and then get a train to New York.\nIn New York, having missed the ship \"China\", Fogg looks for alternative transport. He finds a steamboat, \"Henrietta\", destined for Bordeaux, France. The captain of the boat refuses to take them to Liverpool, whereupon Fogg consents to be taken to Bordeaux for $2,000 per passenger. He then bribes the crew to mutiny and makes course for Liverpool. Against hurricane winds and going on full steam, the boat runs out of fuel after a few days. When the coal runs out, Fogg buys the boat from the captain, then has the crew burn all the wooden parts to keep up the steam.\nThe companions arrive at Queenstown (Cobh), Ireland, take the train to Dublin and then a ferry to Liverpool, still in time to reach London before the deadline. Once on English soil, Fix arrests Fogg. A short time later, the misunderstanding is cleared up \u2013 the actual robber had been caught three days earlier in Edinburgh. As a result of the delay, Fogg misses the scheduled train to London; he orders a special train and arrives in London apparently five minutes late, certain he has lost the wager.\nThe following day Fogg apologises to Aouda for bringing her with him since he now has to live in poverty and cannot support her. Aouda confesses that she loves him and asks him to marry her. As Passepartout notifies a minister, he learns that he is mistaken in the date \u2013 it is not 22 December, but instead 21 December. Because the party had travelled eastward, their days were shortened by four minutes for every degree of longitude they crossed; thus, although they had experienced the same amount of time abroad as people had experienced in London, they had seen 80 sunrises and sunsets while London had seen only 79. Passepartout informs Fogg of his mistake and Fogg hurries to the Club just in time to meet his deadline and win the wager. Having spent almost \u00a319,000 of his travel money during the journey, he divides the remainder between Passepartout and Fix and marries Aouda.\nBackground and analysis.\n\"Around the World in Eighty Days\" was written during difficult times, both for France and Verne. It was during the Franco-Prussian War (1870\u20131871) in which Verne was conscripted as a coastguard; he was having financial difficulties (his previous works were not paid royalties); his father had died recently; and he had witnessed a public execution, which disturbed him.\nThe technological innovations of the 19th century had opened the possibility of rapid circumnavigation, and the prospect fascinated Verne and his readership. In particular, three technological breakthroughs occurred in 1869\u20131870 that made a tourist-like around-the-world journey possible for the first time: the completion of the first transcontinental railroad in America (1869), the opening of the Suez Canal (1869), and the linking of the Indian railways across the sub-continent (1870). It was another notable mark at the end of an age of exploration and the start of an age of fully global tourism that could be enjoyed in relative comfort and safety. It sparked the imagination that anyone could sit down, draw up a schedule, buy tickets and travel around the world, a feat previously reserved for only the most heroic and hardy of adventurers.\nThe story began serialization in \"Le Temps\" on 6 November 1872. The story was published in installments over the next 45 days, with its ending timed to synchronize Fogg's 21 December deadline with the real world. Chapter XXXV appeared on 20 December; 21 December, the date upon which Fogg was due to appear back in London, did not include an installment of the story; on 22 December, the final two chapters announced Fogg's success. As it was being published serially for the first time, some readers believed that the journey was actually taking place \u2013 bets were placed, and some railway companies and ship liner companies lobbied Verne to appear in the book. It is unknown if Verne submitted to their requests, but the descriptions of some rail and shipping lines leave some suspicion he was influenced.\nConcerning the final \"coup de th\u00e9\u00e2tre\", Fogg had thought it was one day later than it actually was because he had forgotten that during his journey, he had added a full day to his clock, at the rate of an hour per 15\u00b0 of longitude crossed. A recurring criticism of the book is that Fogg should have known and planned for this phenomenon due to his \"exact\" nature, despite him being shown to make similar errors elsewhere. At the time of publication and until 1884, a \"de jure\" International Date Line did not exist. If it did, he would likely have been made aware of the change in date once he reached this line. Thus, the day he added to his clock throughout his journey would be removed upon crossing it. However, Fogg's mistake would not have been likely to occur in the real world because a \"de facto\" date line did exist. The UK, India, and the US had the same calendar despite different local times. When he arrived in San Francisco, he would have noticed that the local date was one day earlier than shown in his travel diary. Consequently, it is unlikely he would fail to notice that the departure dates of the transcontinental train in San Francisco and of the China steamer in New York were one day earlier than his travel diary. He would also somehow have to avoid looking at any newspapers. Additionally, in \"Who Betrays Elizabeth Bennet?\", John Sutherland points out that Fogg and company would have to be \"deaf, dumb and blind\" not to notice how busy the streets were on an apparent \"Sunday\", with the Sunday Observance Act 1780 still in effect.\nReal-life imitations.\nFollowing publication in 1873, various people attempted to follow Fogg's fictional circumnavigation, often within self-imposed constraints:\nOrigins.\nThe idea of a trip around the world within a set period had clear external origins. It was popular before Verne published his book in 1873. Even the title \"Around the World in Eighty Days\" is not original. Several sources have been hypothesized as the origins of the story.\nAnother early reference comes from the Italian traveler Giovanni Francesco Gemelli Careri. He wrote a book in 1699 that was translated into French: Voyage around the World or \"Voyage du Tour du Monde\" (1719, Paris).\n\"Around the World by Steam, via Pacific Railway\", was published in 1871 by the Union Pacific Railroad Company, and an \"Around the World in A Hundred and Twenty Days\" by Edmond Planchut. In early 1870, the Erie Railway Company published a statement of routes, times, and distances detailing a trip around the globe of in 77 days and 21 hours.\nAmerican William Perry Fogg traveled the world, describing his tour in a series of letters to \"The Cleveland Leader\" newspaper, entitled, \"Round the World: Letters from Japan, China, India, and Egypt\" (1872).\nIn 1872, Thomas Cook organised the first around-the-world tourist trip, leaving on 20 September 1872 and returning seven months later. The journey was described in a series of letters published in 1873 as \"Letter from the Sea and from Foreign Lands, Descriptive of a tour Round the World.\" Scholars have pointed out similarities between Verne's account and Cook's letters. However, some argue that Cook's trip happened too late to influence Verne. According to a second-hand 1898 account, Verne refers to a Cook advertisement as a source for the idea of his book. In interviews in 1894 and 1904, Verne says the source was \"through reading one day in a Paris cafe\" and \"due merely to a tourist advertisement seen by chance in the columns of a newspaper.\" \"Around the World\" itself says the origins were a newspaper article. All of these point to Cook's advert as being a probable spark for the idea of the book.\nThe periodical \"Le Tour du monde\" (3 October 1869) contained a short piece titled \"Around the World in Eighty Days\", which refers to of the railway not yet completed between Allahabad and Bombay, a central point in Verne's work. But even the \"Le Tour de monde\" article was not entirely original; it cites in its bibliography the \"Nouvelles Annales des Voyages, de la G\u00e9ographie, de l'Histoire et de l'Arch\u00e9ologie\" (August 1869), which also contains the title \"Around the World in Eighty Days\" in its contents page. The \"Nouvelles Annales\" were written by Conrad Malte-Brun (1775\u20131826) and his son Victor Adolphe Malte-Brun (1816\u20131889). Scholars believe that Verne was aware of the \"Le Tour de monde\" article, the \"Nouvelles Annales,\" or both and that he consulted it or them, noting that the \"Le Tour du monde\" even included a trip schedule very similar to Verne's final version.\nA possible inspiration was the traveller George Francis Train, who made four trips around the world, including one in 80 days in 1870. Similarities include the hiring of a private train and being imprisoned. Train later claimed, \"Verne stole my thunder. I'm Phileas Fogg.\"\nRegarding the idea of gaining a day, Verne said of its origin: \"I have a great number of scientific odds and ends in my head. It was thus that, when, one day in a Paris caf\u00e9, I read in the \"Si\u00e8cle\" that a man could travel around the world in 80 days, it immediately struck me that I could profit by a difference of meridian and make my traveller gain or lose a day in his journey. There was a d\u00e9nouement ready found. The story was not written until long after. I carry ideas about in my head for years \u2013 ten, or 15 years, sometimes \u2013 before giving them form.\" In his April 1873 lecture, \"The Meridians and the Calendar\", Verne responded to a question about where the change of day occurred since the International Date Line only became current in 1880 and the Greenwich prime meridian was not adopted internationally until 1884. Verne cited an 1872 article in \"Nature,\" and Edgar Allan Poe's short story \"Three Sundays in a Week\" (1841), which was also based on going around the world and the difference in a day linked to a marriage at the end. Verne even analysed Poe's story in his \"Edgar Poe and His Works\" (1864).\nAdaptations and influences.\nThe book has been adapted or reimagined many times in different forms.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Each of two hearings in English courts found some of the leaflet's contested claims to be libellous and others to be true.\nThe original case lasted nearly ten years which, according to the BBC and The Guardian, made it the longest-running trial in English history. McDonald's announced it did not plan to collect the \u00a340,000 it was awarded by the courts. Following the decision, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled in \"Steel &amp; Morris v United Kingdom\" that the pair had been denied a fair trial, in breach of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (right to a fair trial), and their conduct should have been protected by Article 10 of the Convention, which protects the right to freedom of expression. The court awarded a judgment of \u00a357,000 against the UK government. McDonald's itself was not involved in, or a party to, this action, as applications to the ECHR are independent cases filed against the relevant state.\nFranny Armstrong and Ken Loach made a documentary film, \"McLibel\", about the case.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nHelen Steel and David Morris were two environmental activists of London Greenpeace, a small environmental campaigning group that existed between 1972 and 2001. In 1986 they distributed \"a few hundred copies\" of a six-page leaflet titled \"What's wrong with McDonald's: everything they don't want you to know\" in Strand, London. The leaflet accused the company of paying low wages, cruelty to animals used in its products, damaging the environment, and other malpractices. The group were not affiliated with the larger Greenpeace International organisation, which they declined to join as they saw it as too \"centralised and mainstream\".\nLibel charges.\nIn 1990, McDonald's brought libel proceedings against five London Greenpeace supporters, Paul Gravett, Andrew Clarke and Jonathan O'Farrell, as well as Steel and Morris, for distributing the sheet on the streets of London. This case followed past instances in which McDonald's threatened to sue more than fifty organisations for libel, including Channel 4 television and several major publications. In all such cases, the media outlets settled and apologised.\nUnder English defamation law at the time, the defendant had to show that each disparaging statement made was substantively true. This could be an expensive and time-consuming process. Gravett, Clarke and O'Farrell apologised as requested by McDonald's, but Steel and Morris chose to defend the case.\nThe two were denied legal aid, as was policy for libel cases, despite having limited income. Thus, they had to represent themselves, though they received significant pro bono assistance, including from Keir Starmer. Steel and Morris called 180 witnesses, seeking to prove their assertions about food poisoning, unpaid overtime, misleading claims about how much McDonald's recycled, and \"corporate spies sent to infiltrate the ranks of London Greenpeace\". McDonald's spent several million pounds, while Steel and Morris spent \u00a330,000; this disparity in funds meant Steel and Morris were not able to call all the witnesses they wanted, especially witnesses from South America who were intended to support their claims about McDonald's activities in that continent's rainforests.\nIn its libel allegation, McDonald's asserted all claims in the pamphlet to be false. They found it difficult to support this position despite the indirectness of some of the claims. The case eventually became a media circus. McDonald's executives, including Ray Cesca, entered the witness box, enabling cross-examination by the defendants.\nIn June 1995, McDonald's offered to settle the case (which \"was coming up to its [tenth] anniversary in court\") by donating a large sum of money to a charity chosen by the two. They further specified they would drop the case if Steel and Morris agreed to \"stop criticising McDonald's\". Steel and Morris secretly recorded the meeting, in which McDonald's said the pair could criticise McDonald's privately to friends but must cease talking to the media or distributing leaflets. Steel and Morris wrote a letter in response saying they would agree to the terms if McDonald's ceased advertising its products and instead only recommended the restaurant privately to friends.\nJudgment.\nHigh Court.\nThe case was adjudicated by Mr Justice Rodger Bell. On 19 June 1997, Bell delivered his more than 1,000-page judgment largely in favour of McDonald's, finding the claims that McDonald's was responsible for starvation and deforestation were false and libellous. The ruling was summarized by a 45-page paper read in court. Steel and Morris were found liable on several points, but the judge also found some of the points in the factsheet were true. McDonald's considered this a legal victory, though it was tempered by the judge's endorsement of some of the allegations in the sheet. Specifically, Bell ruled that McDonald's endangered the health of their workers and customers by \"misleading advertising\", that they \"exploit children\", that they were \"culpably responsible\" in the infliction of unnecessary cruelty to animals, and they were \"antipathetic\" to unionisation and paid their workers low wages. Furthermore, although the decision awarded \u00a360,000 to the company, McDonald's legal costs were much greater, and the defendants lacked the funds to pay it. Steel and Morris immediately appealed against the decision.\nIn 1998 a documentary film was made about the case, also titled \"McLibel\". This was updated in 2005 after the verdict of the final appeal.\nIn September 1998, the pair sued the Metropolitan Police for disclosing confidential information to investigators hired by McDonald's and received \u00a310,000 and an apology for the disclosure.\nCourt of Appeal.\nAn appeal began on 12 January 1999, and lasted 23 court days, ending on 26 February. The case was heard in Court 1 of the Court of Appeal in the Royal Courts of Justice. The case was adjudicated by Lord Justices Pill and May and Mr Justice Keene. The defendants represented themselves in court, assisted by first year law student Kalvin P. Chapman (King's College London). McDonald's were represented by libel lawyer Richard Rampton, and a junior barrister, Timothy Atkinson, and Ms Pattie Brinley-Codd of Barlow, Lyde &amp; Gilbert. Steel and Morris filed a 63-point appeal. They had requested a time extension, but were denied. The verdict for the appeal was handed down on 31 March, in Court 1 at the Royal Courts of Justice.\nThe judges ruled it was fair comment to say that McDonald's employees worldwide \"do badly in terms of pay and conditions\" and true \"if one eats enough McDonald's food, one's diet may well become high in fat, etc., with the very real risk of heart disease\".\nAs a result of their further findings against the corporation, the three Lord Justices reduced Mr Justice Bell's award of \u00a360,000 damages to McDonald's by \u00a320,000. The court ruled against the argument by Steel and Morris that multinational corporations should no longer be able to sue for libel over public interest issues. Steel and Morris announced their intention to appeal over these and other points to the House of Lords, and then take the UK government to the European Court of Human Rights if necessary.\nIn response to the verdict, David Pannick said in \"The Times\": \"The McLibel case has achieved what many lawyers thought impossible: to lower further the reputation of our law of defamation in the minds of all right thinking people.\"\nSteel and Morris appealed to the Law Lords, arguing that their right to legal aid had been unjustly denied. When the Law Lords refused to accept the case, the pair formally retained solicitor Mark Stephens and barrister Keir Starmer to file a case with the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), contesting the UK government's policy that legal aid was not available in libel cases, and setting out a highly detailed case for what they believed to be the oppressive and unfair nature of UK libel laws in general, and in their case in particular. In September 2004, this action was heard by the ECHR. Lawyers for Steel and Morris argued that the lack of legal aid had breached the pair's right to freedom of expression and to a fair trial.\nEuropean Court of Human Rights.\nOn 15 February 2005, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the original case had breached Article 6 (right to a fair trial) and Article 10 (right to freedom of expression) of the European Convention on Human Rights and ordered that the UK government pay Steel and Morris \u00a357,000 in compensation. In their ruling, the ECHR criticised the way in which UK laws had failed to protect the public right to criticise corporations whose business practices affect people's lives and the environment (which violates Article 10); they also ruled that the trial was biased because of the defendants' comparative lack of resources and what they believed were complex and oppressive UK libel laws.\nIn particular the Court held:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;in a democratic society even small and informal campaign groups, such as London Greenpeace, must be able to carry on their activities effectively and that there exists a strong public interest in enabling such groups and individuals outside the mainstream to contribute to the public debate by disseminating information and ideas on matters of general public interest such as health and the environment.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The safeguard afforded by Article 10 to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they act in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism\u00a0..., and the same principle must apply to others who engage in public debate.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is true that large public companies inevitably and knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their acts and, as in the case of the businessmen and women who manage them, the limits of acceptable criticism are wider in the case of such companies.\nIn response to the European Court of Human Rights' decision, Steel and Morris issued the following press release:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Having largely beaten McDonald's\u00a0... we have now exposed the notoriously oppressive and unfair UK laws. As a result of the\u00a0... ruling today, the government may be forced to amend or scrap some of the existing UK laws. We hope that this will result in greater public scrutiny and criticism of powerful organisations whose practices have a detrimental effect on society and the environment. The McLibel campaign has already proved that determined and widespread grass roots protests and defiance can undermine those who try to silence their critics, and also render oppressive laws unworkable. The continually growing opposition to McDonald's and all it stands for is a vindication of all the efforts of those around the world who have been exposing and challenging the corporation's business practices.\nPost court developments.\nIn the course of the UK undercover policing relationships scandal it was revealed that one of the authors of the \"McLibel leaflet\" was Bob Lambert, an undercover police officer who infiltrated London Greenpeace. John Dines, another undercover officer, was Helen Steel's partner for two years; she was unaware of his true identity and motives.\nThe Defamation Act 2013 brought some changes to libel cases, which were expected to make it harder for corporations to abuse libel law.\nThe McLibel case also raised awareness about how defamation proceedings can harm the reputation of companies that raise them, similarly to the Streisand effect.\nMcDonald's response.\nThe \"McLibel\" film quoted McDonald's as offering little comment on the European Court decision, other than to point out that it was the Government and not McDonald's who was the losing party and that \"times have changed and so has McDonald's\".\nOn a website aiming to state its view on issues raised about it, McDonald's stated that the case is in the past and the issues more so, and that both sides in it have moved on (although Morris and Steel did continue related litigation).\nLater events.\nChapter 5 of Paul Lewis and Rob Evans' 2012 book \"\" is titled \"McSpies\". In recounting the history of the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS) it recounts the involvement of undercover policemen Bob Lambert and John Dines in the activities which led up to the trial. \"The Guardian\" later reported that Lambert had co-written the leaflet that was central to the libel trial. Steel has stated that Dines became treasurer of London Greenpeace.\nDocuments from the case showed that McDonald's private investigators had been receiving information from the Metropolitan Police. The Metropolitan Police were sued over this, which was settled out of court and with an apology and the Metropolitan Police undertaking not to share information from police computers with corporations.\nMedia.\nA feature-length documentary film, \"McLibel\", was made about the case by Franny Armstrong and Ken Loach in 1997. An extended version was produced in 2005, with estimated viewing audience of 25 million.\nThe documentary features courtroom reconstructions of the trial. It also features interviews with Eric Schlosser (author of the 2001 book \"Fast Food Nation\"), Morgan Spurlock (writer/director of the 2004 film \"Super Size Me\"), Keir Starmer (who provided free legal support to the McLibel defendants for many years), and Howard Lyman (who appeared on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" about mad cow disease).\nIn April 2022 the case was the subject for a programme in the BBC Radio 4 series \"The Reunion\".\nIn August 2025, the case was the subject of a season of the BBC Radio 4 series Shadow World, entitled \"The People vs McDonald's\" that was presented by Mark Steel.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Prices rose on average roughly sixfold over 150 years. This level of inflation amounts to 1.2% per year compounded, a relatively low inflation rate for modern-day standards, but rather high given the monetary policy in place in the 16th century.\nGenerally it is thought that this high inflation was caused by the large influx of gold and silver from the Spanish treasure fleet from the New World, including Mexico, Peru, Bolivia and the rest of the Spanish Empire.70\nSpecie flowed through Spain increasing its prices and those of allied European countries (e.g., the imperial territories of Charles V). Wealth then spread to the rest of Western Europe as a result of the Spanish balance of payments deficit, or was directly introduced to countries like Great Britain and France, using piracy to attack the Spanish fleet. This enlarged the monetary supply and price levels of many European countries.\nBackground.\nMost historians look at the end of the Renaissance as the start of the Price Revolution. An era that was often considered a time of peace for the Western European population, the Renaissance was a period when Western Europe experienced equilibrium in the price of commodities and labor. It also was a period when there was a high concentration of wealth in the hands of a few (the Black Death had wiped out nearly a third of the population a century before). Additionally, Europe experienced technological advancement in the mining industry, the stream of currency through debasement from royals, and the emergence of Protestantism.\nThe severe shortage of precious metals during the late 15th and early 16th centuries eased in the second half of the 16th century. The Spanish mined American gold and silver at minimal cost and flooded the European market with an abundance of specie. This influx caused a relative decrease in the value of these metals in comparison with agricultural and craft products. Furthermore, depopulation \u2013 specifically in southern Spain \u2013 resulted in a high rate of inflation. The failure of the Spanish to control the influx of gold and the price fluctuations of gold and silver from the American mines, combined with war expenditures, led to three bankruptcies of the Spanish monarchy by the end of the 16th century.\nIn the 16th century, prices increased consistently throughout Western Europe, and by the end of the century prices reached levels three to four times higher than at the beginning. The annual inflation rate ranged from 1% to 1.5%. Since the monetary system of the 16th century was based on specie (mostly silver) this inflation rate was significant. The specie-centered monetary organization had its own price-level stabilization property: rising commodity prices led to a fall in the purchasing power of the monetary metals, and therefore less incentive to mine them and more incentive to use them for non-monetary purposes. This stabilizing adjustment of the money supply led to long-run stability of price levels regardless of permanent shifts in money demand over time. Therefore, the long-run inflation can only be explained either by the devaluation of coins or by shifts in the supply of the specie. An increase in the productivity of mining in Peru led to a fall in the price of metals relative to rising prices for other commodities in Europe. This process is only remedied if the purchasing power of the metal is equal to its production costs.\nCauses.\nInflux of gold and silver.\nFrom an economic viewpoint the discovery of new silver and gold deposits as well as the productivity increase in the silver mining industry perpetuated the price revolution. When precious metals entered Spain, this influx drove up the Spanish price level and caused a balance of payments deficit. This deficit occurred on account of Spanish demand for foreign products exceeding exports to foreign markets. The deficit was financed by the metals that entered these foreign countries and in turn increased their money supply and drove up their price levels.\nThe increased importation of specie to Spain started in Central Europe around the beginning of the sixteenth century. According to Michael North (1994) central European silver output doubled between 1470 and 1520, and increased even more in the 1520s with the new mine of Joachimsthal. Also during this time the Spanish and Portuguese brought a large amount of gold from the New World to Europe. Starting in the 1540s a growing amount of silver was shipped to Europe from Zacatecas, Guanajuato and Taxco mines in Mexico and the Potos\u00ed mountain in Peru. The production of the Potos\u00ed mine increased greatly in the 1560s after mercury deposits had been discovered in the Andes, as mercury was necessary to process the silver. Based on the records of Earl J. Hamilton (1934), the total imports of specie from the Americas during the 16th century amounted to around 210 million pesos, with 160 million of these pesos being imported in the second half of the 16th century. The total amount of silver imported added up to about 3,915 metric tons of silver. However these numbers underestimate the total amount imported to Spain because Hamilton only counted imports recorded by the official Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n in Seville, not including the specie shipped directly to C\u00e1diz by the Dutch and British East India Companies. The influx of these precious metals and the resulting money supply shocks help explain the price increase in Spain during the 16th century.\nEuropean silver production.\nSome accounts emphasize the role of increased silver production within Europe itself. According to Nef, the output of silver mines in Bohemia, Germany and Hungary increased rapidly from c.\u20091460 to c.\u20091510. Production peaked in the 1530s, thereafter slowly declining for the next 30 years. After 1560, the decline in European silver production was rapid. Flynn contends that imports of silver from Spanish America is behind this decline in European silver mining.\nQuantity theory of money.\nThe first scholar to make a quantity-theory link between the influx of American \"treasure\" and the Price Revolution was Mart\u00edn de Azpilcueta in 1556, although French philosopher Jean Bodin is more often credited, because of his 1568 response to a 1566 treatise by the Royal Councilor Jean de Malestroit. Malestroit argued that lower-quality coins were the chief culprit of price influx\u2014similar to the periodic inflations of the 14th and 15th centuries. Bodin dismissed this argument, contending that the growing influx of silver from the Spanish Americas was the primary cause of price inflation. Championed for the quantity theory of money, Bodin was able to demonstrate that the inflation of prices in France was due far more to Spanish-American influx than to any change in coin debasement.\nEarl Hamilton, a contemporary price revolution theorist, found that no Spanish writer of the 16th century had voiced opinions similar to those of Jean Bodin despite having conducted meticulous research into Spanish treatises, letters, and other documents. This, however, was not true; less well known is an even earlier Spanish publication in a treatise from 1556 by the cleric Mart\u00edn de Azpilcueta of the Salamanca School, which made virtually the same claim about the role of Spanish-American silver in the rise of prices.\nDebasement.\nRegardless, Malestroit did put forth several valid claims about the price revolution that continue to hold up today, particularly his argument explaining the different price indexes and why the Spanish prices rose the least and the Brabantine the most. Spain, unlike most other European countries of this era, underwent no debasements of the gold and silver coinages during most of the period, but that all changed in 1599, when the new Spanish king Philip III (1598\u20131621) introduced the purely copper \"vellon\" coinage.\nFollowing Henry VIII of England and his infamous \"Great Debasement\" programme that began 1526, the Spanish King Philip III tried to cement his Spanish legacy through changes in coinage strategy. Previously, Spanish kings (at least from 1471) issued a largely copper fractional coinage called blancas, with a nominal money-of-account value of 0.5 maraved\u00ed, but with a very small amount of silver to convince the public that it was indeed precious-metal \"money\". The blanca issued in 1471 had a silver fineness of 10 grains or 3.47% (weighing 1.107\u00a0g). In 1497, that fineness was reduced to 7 grains (2.43% fine); in 1552, to 5.5 grains (1.909% fine); in 1566, to 4 grains (1.39% fine). By the start of the 17th century, inflation took hold of Spain as the gap between nominal and silver-based prices dramatically shifted. The purely copper coinage had done its damage to Spain. The difference between the silver- and vellon-based price indexes in Spain showed that the purely copper coinage other European countries used made up a much smaller proportion of the total coined money supply (something the Spanish kings had overlooked and Malestroit was able to pinpoint).\nBlack Death.\nDemographic factors also contributed to upward pressure on prices with the resurgence of European population growth after the century of depopulation following the Black Death (1347\u20131353). The price of food rose during the years of the plague, and then began to fall as the population of nations decreased. At the same time prices of manufactured goods rose because of a displacement of supply. As the nations began to recover and repopulate after the Black Death, the increase in population placed greater demands on agriculture. Later on, increased population placed greater demands on an agricultural area that had contracted significantly after the 1340s, or had been converted from arable to less intensive livestock production.\nHowever, population growth and recovery in countries such as England are not consistent with inflation during the early stages of the price revolution. In 1520 at the beginning of the price revolution England's population was roughly 2.5 million people. This is about half of the English population of 5 million in 1300. Critics of the population argument raise the question that if England at the beginning stages of the price revolution was very unpopulated, how could any renewed growth from such a low level immediately spark inflation? It can be argued that population growth led to a price increase in the agrarian sector because of an increase demand for food. Marginal lands that were not very fertile and far away from markets were unable to adopt the technological developments to offset the lower returns of farming. In turn this led to a higher marginal cost to farming and resulted in a price increase for grains and other agricultural goods that surpassed the price increase for non-agrarian commodities during the 16th and beginning of the 17th century. The resurgence of population after the plague is linked with the demand-pull explanation of the price revolution. This \"demand-pull\" theory states that an increase in the demand for money and the growth of economic activity produced the rise in prices and a pressure to increase the supply of money.\nUrbanization.\nSome accounts emphasize the role of urbanization. Urbanization contributed to increased trade between Europe's regions, which made prices more responsive to distant changes in demand, and provided a network for the flow of silver from Spain through western and central Europe. Urbanization is often connected with the increased velocity of money theory because the frequency of transactions increases as urban centers grow relative to rural areas. For example, in England, many lands held as common lands were enclosed so that only the landlord could graze his animals. This forced his former tenants either to pay an increased rent, or to leave their own farms. An increase in the number of people unable to afford their farms led to migration into the cities in search of employment. This in turn led to an increase in the velocity of monetary transactions, but was frustrated by the high demand and inelastic supply of food.\nPopulation and agricultural growth.\nIf the influx of Spanish silver was not the initial cause of the European Price Revolution then the best explanation for the Price Revolution is population growth. This theory developed under Earl Hamilton argues that prices were not driven by specie (which, at most, sets a floor to prices) but by the actions of monopolists (or governments) whose positions in this period were enhanced by the steady population growth in Western Europe. The resurgence of population after the plague is linked to the \"demand-pull\" explanation of the price revolution, which states that an increase in the demand for money and the growth of economic activity produced the rise in prices and a pressure to increase the supply of money.\nThe significant increase of European population in the period 1460\u20131620 meant that there were now more people to be fed, clothed, and housed raising the demand for goods of all kinds. Agricultural products then became crucial to the European market. Producers were unable to respond to the rising demand as new and less fertile land were cultivated. Essentially, marginal costs were increasing and per-capita yields were shrinking, while demand continued to rise. The price of agricultural commodities, especially grain, rose sooner and faster than those of other goods, and the inflation of agricultural prices eventually caused a general increase in price level in all industries. Until the mid-17th century, the number of mouths to feed outran the capacity of agriculture to supply basic foodstuffs, causing the vast majority of people to live in a constant state of hunger. Until food production could catch up with the increasing population, prices, especially those of the staple food, bread, continued to rise. Hamilton's theory pointed to evidence of agricultural price growth, slow nonagricultural price growth and poor timing (of the specie outflow to the East) as tangible evidence of the failure to fix prices and feed the growing populace. Hamilton also pointed to monopolistic and other non-competitive techniques as the typical pricing behavior for European products and factor markets of the period.\nEffects.\nSpain.\nExternal debt.\nRising costs to sustain Habsburg war efforts eventually led to a severe rise of the Spanish public debt, of which German and Italian bankers were the creditors. The Habsburg Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor was also King of Spain and borrowed enormous amounts of money from the Fuggers, the Welsers, and Genoese banking families, in order to be elected Emperor and sustain, for over 35 years, the Imperial foreign policy. To repay such loans, he relied primarily on the vast stream of bullion provided by Spanish America. In the 1520s and 1530s, ships full of Aztec and Inca treasures arrived from Mexico and Peru to the courts of Charles V as homage of Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s and Francisco Pizarro. Those treasures were usually minted into coins in Seville and transferred to German bankers in Antwerp, a port city of the Burgundian Low Countries where major agencies of the Fugger and Welser were located. This allowed Antwerp to become the center of the international economy and accelerated the capitalist transition of the Low Countries. Certain golden objects have survived in descriptions: for example, some were displayed in Brussels to the German artist Albrecht D\u00fcrer who wrote: \"In all my life, I have seen nothing that rejoiced my heart so much as these things\". French corsaires were constantly disrupting this trade: notably, the treasure of the Aztec emperor Cuauht\u00e9moc was captured by the French corsair Jean Fleury.\nSilver arrived in large amounts, whereas gold was rarer to be found. In 1528, Charles V carved out a colony in Venezuela for his German bankers, hoping to discover the legendary golden city of El Dorado. In 1546, the project came to an end and the German colony was disbanded. In the 1540s and 1550s, the discovery of silver mines in the Americas (such as Potos\u00ed, Zacatecas, Taxco, Guanajuato, Sombrerete) increased the flows of precious metals. Overall, 15 million ducats' worth of bullion reached the Imperial treasury during Charles's reign. This contributed to the higher inflation known as the Spanish price revolution: prices doubled in the first half of the 16th century. The rising costs of war had dramatic consequences on Habsburg finances: one campaign in the 1550s costed as much as one war in the 1520s. Charles V was forced to borrow even more and at higher interest rates, which grew from 17% to 48%.\nDespite opposition from the , Charles V managed to impose this vicious circle that progressively weakened the Spanish finances. Furthermore, in the last years of his reign, Charles V could not be economically supported by his non-Spanish possessions: he exempted the Low Countries from taxation after the Revolt of Ghent in 1540, Germany was in the middle of the Schmalkaldic Wars, and the budget surplus of Italian states was wiped out by the Italian Wars. This ultimately put the financial burden of the Holy Roman Empire on the Spanish kingdoms and led to the bankruptcy of Spain. Unable to sustain his projects financially, Charles V abdicated in 1556 and retired to a monastery in 1558. Sovereign default was declared in 1557.\nLandowners.\nConditions in 16th century Europe support the view that the separation of constantly rising prices and fixed rents destroyed landowners. But this did not apply to Spain, where rent was not fixed and the power of landowners allowed them to raise rent and replace their tenants based on the tenants' ability to meet payments.\nOn the other hand, the price revolution brought impoverishment to those who lived on fixed income and small rents, as their earning could not keep pace with Spanish prices. Small landowners of the class, the lower clergy, government officials, and many others all found their standard of living reduced as commodity prices rose beyond their means. The situation of the peasants is less clear, for it is difficult to reconcile agricultural prosperity and the great rural emigration to the towns, which in turn makes it difficult to explain the alleged extension of cultivation in Spain. But one thing is certain\u2014wages lagged behind prices.\nSellers and traders.\nBut landowners and the rich were not the only ones gaining from the price revolution. Anyone with something to sell or trade could reap the benefits of inflation, particularly manufacturers and merchants. However in the second half of the century, when the conditions of the Price Revolution got worse and relentless inflation began to make Spanish enterprise less competitive in the international and colonial market, not all merchants and manufactures found life enjoyable. Only the more powerful merchants were able to survive foreign competition and in doing so prospered boundlessly. Enormous fortunes were made in the Indies trade (whose expansion was related directly to the rise of prices) and this encouraged more investment and profitable returns. Profitable returns were distributed beyond the merchant houses of Seville to entrepreneurs in other parts of Spain, as the American market took the oil and wine of Andalusia, the wool of Castile, the metallurgical products and ships of the Basque country. To at least the end of the 16th century there was still money to be made in Spain for selected merchants and manufactures.\nThe Crown.\nThe Crown, like its ally the aristocracy, was less crippled by the price revolution than the majority of its subjects. Certainly the cost of administration, and of paying, feeding, and equipping its armed forces, rose for the Crown just as the cost of goods did for the private consumer; unlike other countries, Spain was willing to spend at a higher level to maintain their status as a world power. However, the aristocracy in contrast lost less of its savings than the Crown. The aristocracy could raise rents to increase revenue and not face the full consequences of the Price Revolution. The aristocracy allowed prices to remain high, while inflation alleviated the burden of loans, which became a substantial part of their income.\nRepublic of Genoa.\nUnlike many other states of the period, the Republic of Genoa gambled the majority of its economic interest on the Spanish monarchy\u2014bankers invested their money in the crown and farmers of Spanish revenue, while Genoa's merchants and nobles settled in Spain (Madrid, Seville, Kingdom of Naples and Sicily) marrying local nobility and monopolizing majority of the trade. As long as New Spain was sending silver and gold to the in Seville, Genoa could flourish. Genoa became a large credit market as the capital of Italian cities was all drained towards Genoa.\nA multitude of small investors, Genoese and others, obtained from the Crown long-term securities () as collateral for their loans. Also short-term loans known as could be converted into long-term . The contracts specified that these securities would be sold if the Crown did not repay the loans. In essence, the Genoese bankers had worked out an interest rate swap. Furthermore, the Crown sold silver spot in Spain to the Genoese in exchange for future delivery of gold in Antwerp, where the gold was used to pay Spanish troops fighting in the Low Countries. Genoa benefited from the price revolution as they enjoyed the advantage of \"increasing returns to scale in international financial services\". Genoa during the price revolution was a snapshot of global finance at its best. Unfortunately, the decline of Spain in the 17th century brought also the decline of Genoa (due to the Spanish crown's frequent bankruptcies); Genoa's merchant houses particularly suffered. In 1684, Genoa was bombed by a French fleet as punishment for its long alliance with Spain. As a result the Genoese bankers and traders made new economic and financial links with Louis XIV.\nLong term decline of inflation.\nThe inflation of c.\u20091520\u20131640 eventually petered out with the end of the initial rush of New World bullion. Prices remained around or slightly below the levels of the first half of the 17th century until the onset of new inflationary pressures in the latter decades of the 18th century.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is located in Dhi Qar Governorate, Iraq, near the modern city of Basra. Eridu is traditionally considered the earliest city in southern Mesopotamia based on the Sumerian King List. Located south-southwest of the ancient site of Ur, Eridu was the southernmost of a conglomeration of Sumerian cities that grew around temples, almost in sight of one another. The city gods of Eridu were Enki and his consort Damkina. Enki, later known as Ea, was considered to have founded the city. His temple was called E-Abzu, as Enki was believed to live in Abzu, an aquifer from which all life was thought to stem. According to Sumerian temple hymns, another name for the temple of Ea/Enki was called Esira (Esirra).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"... The temple is constructed with gold and lapis lazuli, Its foundation on the nether-sea (apsu) is filled in. By the river of Sippar (Euphrates) it stands. O Apsu pure place of propriety, Esira, may thy king stand within thee. ...\"\nAt nearby Ur there was a temple of Ishtar of Eridu (built by Lagash's ruler Ur-Baba) and a sanctuary of Inanna of Eridu (built by Ur III ruler Ur-Nammu). Ur-Nammu also recorded building a temple of Ishtar of Eridu at Ur which is assumed to have been a rebuild.\nOne of the religious quarters of Babylon, containing the temple called the Esagila as well as the temple of Annunitum, among others, was also named Eridu.\nArchaeology.\nEridu is located on a natural hill in a basin approximately long and deep, which is separated from the Euphrates River by a sandstone ridge called the \"Hazem\". This basin, the \"As Sulaybiyat\" Depression (formerly: \"Khor en-Nejeif\"), becomes a seasonal lake (Arabic: Sebkha) during the rainy season from November to April. During this period, it is filled by the discharge of the Wadi Khanega. Adjacent to eastern edge of the seasonal lake are the Hammar Marshes.\nIn the 3rd Millennium BC a canal, Id-edin-Eriduga (NUN)ki \"the canal of the Eridug plain\", connected Eridu to the Euphrates River, which later shifted its course. The path of the canal is marked by several low tells with 2nd Millennium BC surface pottery and later burials. The site contains 8 mounds:\nThe site was initially excavated by John George Taylor, the British Vice-counsel at Basra, in 1855. Among the finds were inscribed bricks enabling the identification of the site as Eridu. Excavation on the main tell next occurred by R. Campbell Thompson from April 10 until May 8 in 1918, and H. R. Hall from April 21 until May 8 in 1919, who also conducted a survey in the area around the tell. An interesting find by Hall was a piece of manufactured blue glass which he dated to c.\u20092000\u00a0BC. The blue color was achieved with cobalt, long before this technique emerged in Egypt.\nThis lump of glass is currently dated to the 21st century BC or even earlier, and is considered as perhaps the earliest such glass object in the world in the History of glass. It was produced during the Akkadian Empire or the early Ur III period.\nExcavation there resumed from 1946 to 1949 under and Seton Lloyd of the Iraqi Directorate General of Antiquities and Heritage. Among the finds were a Ubaid period terracotta boat model, complete with a socket amidship for a mast and hole for stays and rudder, bevel-rimmed bowls, and a \"lizard type\" figurine like those found in a sounding under the Royal Cemetery of Ur. Soundings in the cemetery showed it to have about 1000 graves, all from the end of the Ubaid period (Temple levels VI and VII). They found a sequence of 17 Ubaid Period superseding temples and an Ubaid Period graveyard with 1000 graves of mud-brick boxes oriented to the southeast. The temple began as a mud brick square with a niche. At Level XI it was rebuilt and eventually reached its final tripartite form in Level VI. In Ur III times a 300 square meter platform was constructed as a base for a ziggurat. These archaeological investigations showed that, according to A. Leo Oppenheim, \"eventually the entire south lapsed into stagnation, abandoning the political initiative to the rulers of the northern cities\", probably as a result of increasing salinity produced by continuous irrigation, and the city was abandoned in 600\u00a0BC. In 1990 the site was visited by A. M. T. Moore who found two areas of surface pottery kilns not noted by the earlier excavators.\nIn October 2014, Franco D\u2019Agostino visited the site in preparation for the coming resumption of excavation, noting a number of inscribed Amar-Sin brick fragments on the surface. In 2019, excavations at Eridu were resumed by a joint Italian, French, and Iraqi effort which included the University of Rome La Sapienza and the University of Strasbourg. Work has included producing new detail topographic and photogrammetric maps and is mainly focused on the Ubaid period cemetery and its associated Ubaid residential area.\nArtifacts.\nIn March 2006, Giovanni Pettinato and S. Chiod from Rome's La Sapienza University claimed to have discovered 500 Early Dynastic historical and literary cuneiform tablets on the surface at Eridu \"disturbed by an explosion\". The tablets were said to be from 2600 to 2100 BC (rulers Eannatum to Amar-Sin) and be part of a library. A team was sent to the site by Iraq's State Board of Antiquities and Heritage which found no tablets, only stamped bricks from Eridu and surrounding sites such as Ur. Nor was there a permit to excavate at the site issued to anyone. At this point Pettinato stated that they had actually found 70 inscribed bricks. This turned out to be stamped bricks used to build the modern Eridu dig-house. The dig-house had been built using bricks from the demolished Leonard Woolley\u2019s expedition house at Ur (clearly spelled out in the 1981 Iraqi excavation report to avoid confusion to future archaeologists). Most of the bricks\nin question were returned to Ur in 1962 for use in restoration efforts.\nArchitecture.\nTemple and ziggurat.\nThe urban nucleus of Eridu was Enki's temple, called House of the Aquifer (Cuneiform: , ; Sumerian: ; Akkadian: ), which in later history was called House of the Waters (Cuneiform: , ; Sumerian: e\u2082-engur; Akkadian: \"b\u012btu engurru\"). The name refers to Enki's realm. His consort Ninhursag had a nearby temple at Ubaid.\nDuring the Ur III period, Ur-Nammu had a ziggurat built over the remains of previous temples. Aside from Enmerkar of Uruk (as mentioned in the \"Aratta\" epics), several later historical Sumerian kings are said in inscriptions found here to have worked on or renewed the \"e-abzu\" temple, including Elili of Ur; Ur-Nammu, Shulgi and Amar-Sin of Ur-III, and Nur-Adad of Larsa.\nLament for Eridu.\nThe fall of early Mesopotamia cities and empires was typically believed to be the result of falling out of favor with the gods. A genre called City Laments developed during the Isin-Larsa period, of which the Lament for Ur is the most famous. These laments had a number of sections (kirugu) of which only fragments have been recovered. The Lament for Eridu describes the fall of that city.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Its king stayed outside his city as if it were an alien city. He wept bitter tears. Father Enki stayed outside his city as if it were an alien city. He wept bitter tears. For the sake of his harmed city, he wept bitter tears. Its lady, like a flying bird, left her city. The mother of E-ma\u1e2b, holy Damgalnuna, left her city. The divine powers of the city of holiest divine powers were overturned. The divine powers of the rites of the greatest divine powers were altered. In Eridug everything was reduced to ruin, was wrought with confusion.\nHistory.\nEridu is one of the earliest settlements in the region, founded c.\u20095400\u00a0BC during the early Ubaid period, at that time close to the Persian Gulf near the mouth of the Euphrates, although in modern times it is about 90 miles inland. Excavation has shown that the city was founded on a virgin sand dune site with no previous habitation. According to the excavators, construction of the Ur III ziggurat and associated buildings was preceded by the destruction of preceding construction and its use as leveling fill so no remains from that time were found. At a small mound 1 kilometer north of Eridu two Early Dynastic III palaces were found, with an enclosure wall. The palaces measured 45 meters by 65 meters with 2.6 meter wide walls and were constructed in the standard Early Dynastic period method of plano-convex bricks laid in a herringbone fashion.\nWith possible breaks in occupation in the Early Dynastic III and Akkadian Empire periods, the city was inhabited until the Neo-Babylonian Empire, though in later times it was primarily a cultic site.\nDuring the Ubaid period the site extended out to an area of about 12 hectares (about 30 acres). Twelve neolithic clay tokens, the precursor to Proto-cuneiform, were found in the Ubaid levels of the site. Eighteen superimposed mudbrick temples at the site underlie the unfinished ziggurat of Amar-Sin (c. 2047\u20132039 BC). Levels XIX to VI were from the Ubaid period and Levels V to I were dated to the Uruk period. Significant habitation was found from the Uruk period with \"non-secular\" buildings being found in soundings. Uruk finds included decorative terracotta cones topped with copper, copper nails topped with gold, a pair of basalt stone lion statues, columns several meters in diameter coated with cones and gypsum, and extensive Uruk period pottery. Occupation increased in the Early Dynastic period with a monumental palace being constructed. An inscription of Elulu, a ruler of the First Dynasty of Ur (c.\u20092600\u00a0BC), was found at Eridu. On a statue of the Early Dynastic ruler of Lagash named Entemena (c.\u20092400\u00a0BC), it reads, \"he built Ab-zupasira for Enki, king of Eridu ...\",\nEridu was active during the Third Dynasty of Ur (22nd to 21st century BC) and royal building activity is known from inscribed bricks notably those of Ur-Nammu from his ziggurat marked \"Ur-Nammu, king of Ur, the one who built the temple of the god Enki in Eridu.\" Three Third Dynasty rulers designated Year Names based on the appointment of an \"en(tu)\"-priestess (high priestess) of the temple of Enki in Eridu, the highest religious office in the land at that time. In each the first two cases it was also used as the succeeding Year Name.\nAfter the fall of Ur III the site was occupied and active during the Isin-Larsa period (early 2nd Millennium BC) as evidenced by a Year Name of Nur-Adad, ruler of Larsa \"Year the temple of Enki in Eridu was built\" and prior texts of Isin rulers Ishbi-Erra and Ishme-Dagan showing control over Eridu. Inscribed construction bricks of Nur-Adad have also been found at Eridu. This continued in the Old Babylonian period with Hammurabi stating in his 33rd Year Name \"Year Hammu-rabi the king dug the canal (called) 'Hammu-rabi is abundance to the people', the beloved of An and Enlil, established the everlasting waters of plentifulness for Nippur, Eridu, Ur, Larsa, Uruk and Isin, restored Sumer and Akkad which had been scattered, overthrew in battle the army of Mari and Malgium and caused Mari and its territory and the various cities of Subartu to dwell under his authority in friendship\"\nIn an inscription of Kurigalzu I (c.\u20091375\u00a0BC), a ruler of the Kassite dynasty one of his epitaphs is \"[he one who ke]eps the sanctuary in Eridu in order\".\nAn inscription of the Second Sealand Dynastic ruler Simbar-shipak (c. 1021\u20131004 BCE) mentions a priest of Eridu.\nThe Neo-Assyrian emperor Sargon II (722\u2013705 BCE) awarded \"andur\u0101ru\"-status (described as \"a periodic reinstatement of goods and persons, alienated because of want, to their original status\") to Eridu.\nThe Neo-Babylonian ruler Nebuchadnezzar II (605\u2013562 BC) built at Eridu as evidenced by inscribed bricks found there.\nMythology.\nIn some, but not all, versions of the Sumerian King List, Eridu is the first of five cities where kingship was received before a flood came over the land. The list mentions two rulers of Eridu from the Early Dynastic period, Alulim and Alalngar.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nIn Sumerian mythology, Eridu was the home of the Abzu temple of the god Enki, the Sumerian counterpart of the Akkadian god Ea, god of deep waters, wisdom and magic. Like all the Sumerian and Babylonian gods, Enki/Ea began as a local god who, according to the later cosmology, came to share the rule of the cosmos with Anu and Enlil. His kingdom was the sweet waters that lay below earth (Sumerian \"ab\"=water; \"zu\"=far).\nThe bright star Canopus was known to the ancient Mesopotamians and represented the city of Eridu in the \"Three Stars Each\" Babylonian star catalogues and later around 1100 BC on the MUL.APIN tablets. Canopus was called MUL.NUNKI by the Babylonians, which translates as \"star of the city of Eridu\". From most southern city of Mesopotamia, Eridu, there is a good view to the south, so that about 6000 years ago due to the precession of the Earth's axis the first rising of the star Canopus in Mesopotamia could be observed only from there at the southern meridian at midnight. In the city of Ur this was the case only 60 years later.\nIn the flood myth tablet found in Ur, how Eridu and Alulim were chosen by gods as first city and first priest-king is described in more detail. The following is the English translation of the tablet:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nAdapa, a man of Eridu, is depicted as an early culture hero. Although earlier tradition, Me-Turan/Tell-Haddad tablet, describes Adapa as postdiluvian ruler of Eridu, in late tradition, Adapa came to be viewed as Alulim\u2019s vizier, and he was considered to have brought civilization to the city as the sage of King Alulim.\nThe stories of Inanna, goddess of Uruk, describe how she had to go to Eridu in order to receive the gifts of civilization. At first Enki, the god of Eridu, attempted to retrieve these sources of his power but later willingly accepted that Uruk now was the centre of the land.\nList of rulers.\nThe following list should not be considered complete:\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nLanguage.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It took place on 20 April 1992, at Wembley Stadium in London, England.\nThe concert was a posthumous tribute to Queen's lead vocalist, Freddie Mercury, who had died of an AIDS-related illness on 24 November 1991. It was broadcast live worldwide, and watched by an estimated one billion people.\nProceeds from the concert totalled \u00a320 million, and were used to launch the Mercury Phoenix Trust. \nBackground.\nQueen lead singer Freddie Mercury died from AIDS-related complications on 24 November 1991. Mercury had kept his AIDS diagnosis private until the week of his death, and it was later revealed that he had donated substantial amounts to AIDS charities that year. \nThe surviving members of Queen (John Deacon, Brian May and Roger Taylor) resolved to continue raising money for charity to honour Mercury's legacy. May said it was decided by the band the night of Mercury's death to stage a concert as his memorial, giving him \"an exit in the true style to which he's accustomed.\".\nA wishlist of performers was created by the band, with Elton John and Elizabeth Taylor recruited since they were already publicly involved with AIDS charities. The band had ruled out a single vocalist performing with them, as they felt Mercury's range could not be duplicated without a variety of singers. May and Taylor publicly announced the event at the Brit Awards on 12 February 1992.\nProduction.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n \u2014Spike Edney, Queen's musical director\nHarvey Goldsmith promoted the concert, which was held on 20 April 1992 at London's Wembley Stadium. Queen had previously played their famous Live Aid set at the venue in 1985, and sold out two nights at the stadium for their Magic Tour the following year.\nRehearsals were held at Nomis Studios in London, Bray Film Studios in Water Oakley, and at Wembley Stadium on the eve of the concert. Queen assigned their songs to the gathered artists, having decided beforehand which singers would sound best on each track.\nSeventy-two thousand tickets were sold for the event. A live television broadcast was produced by Queen, Jim Beach, Dominic Anciano and Ray Burdis, directed by David Mallet, and broadcast to 70 countries. One billion people were estimated to have watched the concert live on television. The event raised \u00a320 million for the Mercury Phoenix Trust, although the donation was presumed to be less after deducting production costs and travel accommodations for the talent.\nConcert synopsis.\nThe event lasted four and a half hours, exceeding the planned runtime by one hour, and ending at 22:30 BST. Cindy Crawford hosted the event, providing backstage interviews with the day's performers. To raise awareness for the cause, 100,000 red ribbons and 40,000 red scarves were distributed to fans entering the venue. \nAn onstage introduction from the surviving members of Queen opened the show. The concert then commenced with opening sets from Metallica, Extreme, Def Leppard, Bob Geldof, Spinal Tap, and Guns N' Roses. Prerecorded performances from U2 and Mango Groove were also shown. Elizabeth Taylor was introduced to the stage via satellite by Ian McKellen, and she spoke to the audience about AIDS prevention.\nQueen's set began with a video montage of Mercury's call and response interactions with his audiences.

Prior to her marriage, she achieved stardom in several significant Hollywood films in the early to mid-1950s. She received an Academy Award and three Golden Globe Awards, and was ranked 13th on the American Film Institute's 25 Greatest Female Stars list.\nKelly was born into a prominent Catholic family in Philadelphia. After graduating from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in 1949, she began appearing in New York City theatrical productions and television broadcasts. Kelly made her film debut in \"Fourteen Hours\" (1951) and gained stardom from her roles in Fred Zinnemann's western film \"High Noon\" (1952), and John Ford's adventure-romance \"Mogambo\" (1953), the latter of which earned her the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress nomination. She won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in the drama \"The Country Girl\" (1954). Other notable works include the war film \"The Bridges at Toko-Ri\" (1954), the romantic comedy \"High Society\" (1956), and three Alfred Hitchcock suspense thrillers: \"Dial M for Murder\" (1954), \"Rear Window\" (1954), and \"To Catch a Thief\" (1955).\nKelly retired from acting at age 26 to marry Rainier and began her duties as Princess of Monaco. Grace and Rainier had three children: Princess Caroline, Prince Albert, and Princess St\u00e9phanie. Princess Grace's charity work focused on young children and the arts. In 1964, she established the Princess Grace Foundation to support local artisans. Her organization for children's rights, AMADE Mondiale, gained consultive status within UNICEF and UNESCO. Her final film role was narrating \"The Children of Theatre Street\" (1977), which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.\nShe died at the age of 52 at Monaco Hospital, from injuries sustained in a car crash. Her son, Prince Albert, helped establish the Princess Grace Awards in 1984 to recognize emerging performers in film, theatre, and dance.\nEarly life and family.\nGrace Patricia Kelly was born on November 12, 1929, at Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to an affluent and influential family. Her father, John B. Kelly Sr., was born to Irish immigrants; he won three Olympic gold medals for sculling. He owned a successful brickwork contracting company that was well known on the East Coast. As the Democratic Party nominee in the 1935 election for mayor of Philadelphia, he lost by the closest margin in the city's history. In later years, he served on the Fairmount Park Commission and, during World War II, was appointed by President Roosevelt as National Director of Physical Fitness. His brother Walter C. Kelly was a vaudeville star, who also made films for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Paramount Pictures, and another brother named George was a Pulitzer Prize-winning dramatist, screenwriter, and director. He built the family home at 3901 Henry Ave in the East Falls, Philadelphia, neighborhood. The Kellys' former family home went up for sale for $1 million in June 2016. It wound up selling in September 2016 for $775,000.\nKelly's mother, Margaret Majer, was of German ancestry. Margaret had taught physical education at the University of Pennsylvania and had been the first woman to coach women's athletics at Penn. She also modeled for a time in her youth. After marrying John Kelly in 1924, Margaret focused on being a homemaker until all her children were of school age, following which she began actively participating in various civic organizations. Patrilineally, Margaret descended from Prof. Johann Christian von Majer (1741\u20131821) from Ludwigsburg, who worked as a political scientist, jurist and theologian, and was elected five times Rector of the University of T\u00fcbingen. Through him, Grace was descended from the Stauffenberg family \u2014 best known for Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, who attempted to assassinate Adolf Hitler \u2014 as well as from several other minor German noble families, including the von Plieningen, von M\u00fcnchingen, von Ow, von Bettendorf, von Nippenburg, and von Roth families.\nKelly had two older siblings, Margaret and John Jr., and a younger sister, Elizabeth. The children were raised in the Catholic faith, and Grace continued to practice the faith until her death, with Rita Gam describing her as a \"deeply religious person\". Kelly grew up in a small, close-knit Catholic community. She was baptized and received her elementary education in the parish of Saint Bridget's in East Falls. Founded in 1853 by Saint John Neumann, the fourth Bishop of Philadelphia, Saint Bridget's was a relatively young parish, with families very familiar with one another. While attending Ravenhill Academy, a Catholic girls' school, Kelly modeled fashions at local charity events with her mother and sisters. In 1942, at the age of 12, she played the lead in \"Don't Feed the Animals\", a play produced in East Falls by the Old Academy Players.\nIn May 1947, Kelly graduated from Stevens School, a private institution in nearby Chestnut Hill, where she participated in drama and dance programs. Her graduation yearbook listed her favorite actress as Ingrid Bergman and her favorite actor as Joseph Cotten. Written in the \"Stevens' Prophecy\" section was \"Miss Grace P. Kelly\u00a0\u2013 a famous star of stage and screen\". Owing to her low mathematics scores, Kelly was rejected by Bennington College in July 1947. Despite her parents' initial disapproval, Kelly decided to pursue her dreams of becoming an actress. Her father was particularly displeased with her decision, as he viewed acting as \"a slim cut above streetwalker\" at the time. In 1947, Kelly signed with the Walter Thornton Model Agency gracing the covers of magazines.\nIn 1954, Kelly dated and was engaged to Oleg Cassini after his divorce from Gene Tierney.\nCareer.\n1949\u20131950: Beginnings.\nTo start her career, she auditioned for the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York, using a scene from her uncle George Kelly's \"The Torch-Bearers\" (1923). Although the school had already met its semester quota, she obtained an interview with the admissions department, and was admitted through George's influence. Kelly worked diligently, and practiced her speech by using a tape recorder. Her early acting pursuits led her to the stage, and she made her Broadway debut in Strindberg's \"The Father\", alongside Raymond Massey. At 19, her graduation performance was as Tracy Lord in \"The Philadelphia Story\". Her uncle continued to advise and mentor Kelly throughout her acting career.\nAt her father's insistence, she lived at the Barbizon Hotel for Women in Manhattan. She was hired as a model by the John Robert Powers agency, where some of her first modeling jobs were doing commercials for bug spray and cigarettes. Kelly was reportedly \"fond of dancing to Hawaiian music down the hallways of the Barbizon, and given to shocking her fellow residents by performing topless\". She later wrote that she had \"wonderful memories of the three years I spent at the Barbizon\".\nTelevision producer Delbert Mann cast Kelly as the lead in an adaptation of the Sinclair Lewis novel \"Bethel Merriday\"; this was her first of nearly sixty live television programs. She was mentioned in \"Theatre World\" magazine as \"[a] most promising personality of the Broadway stage of 1950\". Some of her well-known works as a theater actress were: \"The Father\", \"The Rockingham Tea Set\", \"The Apple Tree\", \"The Mirror of Delusion\", \"Episode\" (for Somerset Maugham's tele-serial), among others.\nImpressed by her work in \"The Father\", Henry Hathaway, director of the Twentieth Century-Fox film \"Fourteen Hours\" (1951), offered her a small role in the film. Kelly had a minor role opposite Paul Douglas, Richard Basehart, and Barbara Bel Geddes, as a young woman contemplating divorce. Douglas commented: \"In two senses, she did not have a bad side \u2013 you could film her from any angle, and she was one of the most un-temperamental, cooperative people in the business.\" Following the release of the film, the \"Grace Kelly Fan Club\" was established, gaining popularity across the country with local chapters springing up and attracting many members. Kelly referred to her fan club as \"terrifically amusing\".\nKelly was noticed during a visit to the set of \"Fourteen Hours\" by Gary Cooper. However, Kelly's performance in \"Fourteen Hours\" went largely unnoticed by critics and did not contribute to her film career's momentum. She continued her work in the theater and on television, although she lacked \"vocal horsepower\", and it was thought she would likely not have had a lengthy stage career.\n1951\u20131953: Early films and breakthrough.\nKelly was performing at Colorado's Elitch Theatre when producer Stanley Kramer offered her a role co-starring opposite Cooper in Fred Zinnemann's \"High Noon\" (1952), a Western filmed in Columbia, California. She accepted the role, and the film was shot in the late summer and early fall of 1951 over a 28-day shooting schedule in hot weather conditions. She was cast as a \"young Quaker bride to Gary Cooper's stoic marshal\", and wore a \"suitably demure vaguely Victorian dress\". \"High Noon\" garnered four Academy Awards, and has since been ranked by some reviewers among the best films of all time.\nBiographer H. Haughland stated: \"Miss Kelly's acting did not excite the critics, or live up to her own expectations.\" Some critics scoffed at the conclusion of the film in which Cooper's character has to be saved by Kelly's. One critic argued that her pacifist character, killing a man who is about to shoot her husband, was cold and abstract. Alfred Hitchcock described her performance as \"rather mousey\", and stated that it lacked animation. He said that it was only in her later films that she \"really blossomed\" and showed her quality.\nAfter filming \"High Noon\", Kelly returned to New York City and took private acting lessons, wanting to be taken seriously as an actress. She performed in a few dramas in the theater, and in TV serials. She appeared in several television plays, and screen-tested for the film \"Taxi\" in the spring of 1952. Director John Ford noticed Kelly in the screen test, and his studio (MGM) flew her out to Los Angeles to audition in September 1952. Ford said that Kelly showed \"breeding, quality, and class\". She was given the role, along with a seven-year contract with MGM at the relatively low salary of $850 a week (). Kelly signed the deal under two conditions: first, that one out of every two years, she had time off to work in the theatre; and second, that she be able to live in New York City at her residence in Manhattan House, at 200 E. 66th Street, now a landmark.\nIn November 1952, Kelly and the cast arrived in Nairobi to begin the production of the film \"Mogambo\", replacing Gene Tierney, who dropped out at the last minute due to personal issues. Kelly later told Hollywood columnist Hedda Hopper, \"\"Mogambo\" had three things that interested me: John Ford, Clark Gable, and a trip to Africa, with expenses paid. If \"Mogambo\" had been made in Arizona, I wouldn't have done it.\" Kelly played Linda Nordley, a contemplative English wife with a romantic interest in Clark Gable's character. Filming took place over the course of three months. The costumes were designed by Helen Rose. A break in the filming schedule afforded her and \"Mogambo\" co-star Ava Gardner a visit to Rome. The film was released in 1953, and had a successful run at the box office. Kelly won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress, and received her first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her performance.\n1954\u20131956: Critical acclaim and final films.\nAfter the success of \"Mogambo\", Kelly starred in the television play \"The Way of an Eagle\" with Jean-Pierre Aumont, before being cast in the film adaptation of Frederick Knott's Broadway play \"Dial M for Murder\", opposite Ray Milland and Robert Cummings. Kelly played the role of the wealthy wife of a retired professional tennis player. Alfred Hitchcock became one of Kelly's mentors during the last years of her career. She was subsequently lent by MGM to work in several Hitchcock films, which would become some of her most critically acclaimed and recognized work. Kelly began filming scenes for her next film, \"The Bridges at Toko-Ri\", in early 1954, with William Holden, for Paramount Pictures. The story, based on the novel by James Michener, is about American Navy jet fighters stationed to fight in Asia. Kelly played the role of Holden's wife. Edith Head, with whom she had established a friendly relationship, did her costumes.\nKelly unhesitatingly turned down the opportunity to star alongside Marlon Brando in \"On the Waterfront\" (1954). Eva Marie Saint, who replaced her, went on to win an Academy Award for the role. Instead, Kelly played the role of Lisa Fremont in \"Rear Window\". Kelly stated, \"All through the making of \"Dial M for Murder\", he (Hitchcock) sat and talked to me about \"Rear Window\" all the time, even before we had discussed my being in it.\" Kelly's co-star, James Stewart, was highly enthusiastic about working with her. The role of Lisa Fremont, a wealthy Manhattan socialite and fashion model who \"never wore the same dress twice,\" was unlike any of the previous women she had played. This marked her first performance as an independent career woman. In line with their previous collaborations, Hitchcock provided the camera with a slow-sequenced silhouette of Kelly, along with close-ups of the two stars kissing, finally lingering closely on her profile. Hitchcock brought her elegance to the foreground by changing her dresses many times, including: \"glamorous evening short dresses, a sheer negligee over a sleek nightgown, a full-skirted floral dress, and a casual pair of jeans\". Upon the film's opening in October 1954, Kelly was again praised. \"Variety\"'s film critic remarked on the casting, commenting on the \"earthy quality to the relationship between Stewart and Miss Kelly\", as \"both do a fine job of the picture's acting demands\".\nKelly played the role of Bing Crosby's long-suffering wife, Georgie Elgin, in \"The Country Girl\" (1954), after a pregnant Jennifer Jones bowed out. Already familiar with the play, Kelly was highly interested in the part. To do it, MGM once again would have to lend Kelly to Paramount Pictures. Kelly was adamant, and threatened the studio, saying that if they did not allow her to do the film she would pack her bags and leave for New York for good. MGM eventually relented. Kelly also negotiated a more lucrative contract in light of her recent success. In the film, Kelly played the wife of a washed-up, alcoholic singer, played by Crosby. Her character becomes torn emotionally between her two lovers, played by Crosby and William Holden. She was again dressed by Edith Head to suit her role in the film, initially appearing in fashionable dresses, shifting to ordinary-looking cardigans toward the end of the film.\nAs a result of her performance in \"The Country Girl\", Kelly won the Academy Award for Best Actress. Her acceptance speech was brief: \"The thrill of this moment keeps me from saying what I really feel. I can only say thank you with all my heart to all who made this possible for me. Thank you.\" Her main competitor was Judy Garland for her performance in \"A Star Is Born\". After receiving the Oscar nomination, Kelly won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for best actress for her performances in her three big movie roles of 1954: \"Rear Window\", \"Dial M For Murder\", and \"The Country Girl\". At the Golden Globe Awards in 1955, Kelly won the Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama. \"The New York Times\" praised her performance in \"The Country Girl\" as \"excellent\", and \"Rear Window\" got her marquee credits on par with, and beyond, those of Stewart and Hitchcock.\nIn April 1954, Kelly flew to Colombia for a 10-day shoot on her next project, \"Green Fire\", with Stewart Granger. She played Catherine Knowland, a coffee plantation owner. Kelly told Hedda Hopper, \"It wasn't pleasant. We worked at a pathetic village\u00a0\u2013 miserable huts and dirty. Part of the crew got shipwrecked\u00a0... It was awful.\" After the consecutive filming of \"Rear Window\", \"Toko-Ri\", \"Country Girl\", and \"Green Fire\", Kelly flew to the French Riviera to work on her third, and last, film for Hitchcock, \"To Catch a Thief\". Loaned to Paramount for the fifth time, Kelly played the role of a temptress who wears \"luxurious and alluring clothes\", while Cary Grant played the role of a former cat burglar, then looking to catch a thief who is imitating him. Kelly and Grant developed a mutual bond and admiration for each other. Years later, when asked to name his all-time favorite actress, Grant replied: \"Well, with all due respect to dear Ingrid Bergman, I much preferred Grace. She had serenity.\"\nIn 1956, Kelly resided in a home rented from Bill Lear in the Pacific Palisades, California for the duration of her filming. She portrayed Princess Alexandra in the film \"The Swan\", directed by Charles Vidor, opposite Alec Guinness and Louis Jourdan. Her final role was in Charles Walters's musical film \"High Society\", a re-make of MGM's \"The Philadelphia Story\" (1940). She portrayed Tracy Lord, opposite Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, and Celeste Holm in the other leads. When it was released in July 1956, \"Variety\" stated, \"Miss Kelly impresses as the femme lead with pleasantly comedienne overtones,\" and that it was \"possibly her most relaxed performance.\"\nMarriage.\nKelly headed the U.S. delegation at the Cannes Film Festival in April 1955. While there, she was invited to participate in a photo session with Prince Rainier III, the sovereign of the Principality of Monaco, at the Prince's Palace of Monaco. After a series of delays and complications, she met him at the palace on May 6, 1955. \nAfter a year-long courtship described as containing \"a good deal of rational appraisal on both sides,\" they married on April 19, 1956.\nThe Napoleonic Code of Monaco and the laws of the Catholic Church necessitated two ceremonies, civil and religious. The 16-minute civil ceremony took place in the Palace Throne Room of Monaco on April 18, 1956, and a reception later in the day was attended by 3,000 Mon\u00e9gasque citizens. The 142 official titles that she acquired in the union (counterparts of her husband's) were formally recited. The church ceremony took place the following day at Monaco's Saint Nicholas Cathedral, presided over by Bishop Gilles Barthe. The wedding was estimated to have been watched by over 30 million viewers on television, and was described by biographer Robert Lacey in 2010 as \"the first modern event to generate media overkill\". Her wedding dress, designed by MGM's Helen Rose, was worked on for 6 weeks by three dozen dress makers. The couple left that night for their seven-week Mediterranean honeymoon cruise on the prince's yacht.\nPrincess of Monaco.\nPrincess Grace gave birth to the couple's first child, Princess Caroline, on January 23, 1957. Their next child and the heir to the throne, Prince Albert, was born on March 14, 1958. Their youngest, Princess St\u00e9phanie, was born on February 1, 1965.\nDuring her marriage, Grace discontinued her acting career. Instead, she performed her daily duties as princess and became involved in philanthropic work. As princess consort, she became the President of the Red Cross of Monaco (with her sister Peggy Davis and sister-in-law Princess Antoinette as the Vice-Presidents) and the Patron of Rainbow Coalition Children, an orphanage that was run by former dancer, singer and actress Josephine Baker. She hosted an annual Christmas celebration with presents for orphaned children in Monaco. The Princess also served as president of the Garden Club of Monaco, and president of the organizing committee of the International Arts Foundation. Grace retained her link to America by her dual U.S. and Mon\u00e9gasque citizenship.\nGrace and her husband visited Ireland on three occasions, and in 1976 she purchased her family's ancestral homestead in Drumilra, near Newport, County Mayo.\nGrace founded AMADE Mondiale, a Monaco-based, non-profit organization which is recognized by the UN, after she witnessed the plight of Vietnamese children in 1963. According to UNESCO's website, AMADE promotes and protects the \"moral and physical integrity\" and the \"spiritual well-being of children throughout the world, without distinction of race, nationality or religion, and in a spirit of complete political independence.\" The organization currently has cooperative branches across Europe, Asia, South America, and Africa. They retain consultive status with UNICEF, UNESCO, and U.N. Economic &amp; Social Council, alongside participative status with The Council of Europe.\nPrincess Grace was active in improving the arts institutions of Monaco, forming the Princess Grace Foundation in 1964 to support local artisans. In 1965, she accepted the invitation to be an honorary member of La Leche League, a worldwide mother-to-mother support group which focuses on mothering through breastfeeding. She was a speaker at their 1971 conference in Chicago, addressing 1,400 mothers, 1,600 fathers and babies. Grace was a known advocate of breastfeeding, and successfully fed her three children. In 1975, Grace helped found the Princess Grace Academy, the resident school of the Monte Carlo Ballet. She later advocated to preserve the Belle \u00c9poque-era architecture of the principality. Grace hosted a yearly American Week in Monaco, where guests would play baseball and eat ice cream. The palace also celebrated American Thanksgiving annually.\nAlfred Hitchcock offered Princess Grace the lead in his film \"Marnie\" in 1962. She was eager, but public outcry in Monaco against her involvement in a film where she would play a kleptomaniac made her reconsider and ultimately reject the project. Director Herbert Ross tried to interest her in a part in his film \"The Turning Point\" (1977), but Rainier dismissed the idea. Later that year, she returned to the arts in a series of poetry readings on stage and narration of the documentary \"The Children of Theatre Street\". She also narrated ABC's made-for-television film \"The Poppy Is Also a Flower\" (1966).\nGrace joined the board of the 20th Century-Fox Film Corporation in 1976, becoming one of its first female members. In 1980, she published \"My Book of Flowers\" with Gwen Robyns, detailing her sense of floral aesthetics, symbolism, and flower pressing. Grace and Rainier worked together on a 33-minute independent film titled \"Rearranged\" in 1979, which received interest from ABC TV executives in 1982 after its premiere in Monaco, on the condition that it be extended to an hour. Before more scenes could be shot, Grace died and the film was never released, nor was it publicly shown again.\nIn the early 1980s, Grace collaborated with Springmaid Company, the now-defunct bed linen brand. The collaboration was titled \"GPK\" after the initials of her maiden name and features bed linens, tablecloths, napkins, placemats, and others. Both collaborated after Neil Mandell, a newly hired Springmaid stylist, found the designs Grace made in a \"People\" magazine article on the exhibition in a Paris Gallery. Princess Grace received more than $1 million in royalties, which she donated to her favorite charities.\nDeath and funeral.\nOn September 13, 1982, Grace suffered a mild cerebral hemorrhage while driving back to Monaco from her country home in Roc Agel. As a result, she lost control of her 1972 Rover P6 3500 and drove off the steep, winding road and the car tumbled down the mountainside. Her daughter St\u00e9phanie, who was in the passenger seat, unsuccessfully tried to regain control of the car.\nThe Princess was taken to the Monaco Hospital (later named the Princess Grace Hospital Centre) with injuries to the brain and thorax and a fractured femur. Initially that afternoon, she was officially diagnosed with a cerebral hemorrhage and was said to be able to make a full recovery before a second, more severe, hemorrhage struck while at the hospital. She was subsequently declared brain dead. With no reasonable chance of recovery, she died the following night at 10:55\u00a0p.m. after Rainier decided to turn off her life support. She was survived by her husband and her three children. As of 2025, she is the grandmother of eleven grandchildren. \nIn the immediate aftermath of the crash, the palace press office issued a statement claiming that it had been caused by brake failure. However, police investigators found no evidence to suggest this, and when Rover sent engineers from Britain to inspect the car they reached the same conclusion, prompting the company to demand that the palace retract its claim, which it did on September 20. The motor engineers did find, however, that the Princess had kept the car in 'Standard' drive mode while descending, rather than setting it to the 'Mountain' position; this was a special safety gear installed by Rover to allow the driver to navigate twisting turns and sharp gradients, which, as Robert Lacey argues, would have \"slowed her descent significantly\" had it been used.\nPrincess Grace's funeral was held at the Cathedral of Our Lady Immaculate in Monaco-Ville, on September 18, 1982. After a Requiem Mass, she was buried in the Grimaldi family vault. Over 400 people attended, including Cary Grant, Nancy Reagan, Danielle Mitterrand, Empress Farah of Iran, and Diana, Princess of Wales. Princess St\u00e9phanie, who had suffered a light concussion and a hairline fracture of a cervical vertebra in the accident, was unable to attend her mother's funeral.\nRainier, who did not remarry, was buried alongside her after his death in 2005.\nLegacy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"I would like to be remembered as someone who accomplished useful deeds, and who was a kind and loving person. I would like to leave the memory of a human being with a correct attitude and who did her best to help others.\"\u2014\u200a\nKelly left a lasting legacy as a theater artist, television actress, and iconic Hollywood film star. Kelly has been cited as one of the \"classic Hitchcock blondes\", and as one of the most elegant women in cinematic and world history. One author describes her as the \"elegant glamour girl of the screen\". In 1999, Kelly was listed by Joan McIver as one of \"30 Irish-American Women Who Changed Our World.\" In a 2019 edition of the \"American Journal of Irish Studies\", she was described as \"Irish America's poster girl\" and \"an understated Irish-American icon.\" Katherine Boyle of \"The Washington Post\" claimed that Kelly \"had dramatic effects on views of Irish Catholic immigrants in the 1950s. Indeed, America seemed to pardon her tainted blood, tuning into her televised nuptial Mass in droves despite aversion to the religious spectacle.\"\nKelly appeared on the cover of the January 31, 1955, issue of the weekly magazine \"Time\". The magazine hailed her as the top movie star who brought about \"a startling change from the run of smoky film sirens and bumptious cuties\". She was described as the \"Girl in White Gloves\" because she wore \"prim and noticeable white gloves\", and journalists often called her the \"lady\" or \"Miss Kelly\" for this reason. In appreciation of her work with Hitchcock in three of his films, Kelly later wrote a foreword to the book \"The Art of Alfred Hitchcock\" by Donald Spoto. Spoto also has written \"High Society: The Life of Grace Kelly\", a biography published 25 years after her death.\nIn 1982, the Princess Grace Foundation-USA was established by her husband to continue the work she had done anonymously during her lifetime, assisting emerging theater, dance and film artists in America. Incorporated in 1982, PGF-USA is headquartered in New York City and is a tax-exempt, non-profit, publicly supported organization. The Princess Grace Awards, a program of the Princess Grace Foundation-USA, has awarded nearly 800 artists at more than 100 institutions in the U.S. with more than $15\u00a0million to date. The foundation also says it \"holds the exclusive rights and facilitates the licensing of her name and likeness throughout the world.\" Her daughter Princess Caroline took over as president for both the Foundation and AMADE Mondiale after her death, with Prince Albert as vice president. The original Monaco branch of her foundation, named Fondation Princesse Grace, remains active and continues to provide direct aid to students and children within the Monaco and France regions.\nIn 1955, Kelly was photographed by Howell Conant in Jamaica. He photographed her without makeup in a naturalistic setting, a departure from the traditional portrayal of actresses. The resulting photographs were published in \"Collier's\", with a celebrated photo of her rising from the water with wet hair making the cover. Following Grace's marriage, Conant was the unofficial photographer to the House of Grimaldi and extensively photographed her, Rainier, and their three children. In 1992, Conant published \"Grace\", a book of photographs that he took during her 26-year tenure as Princess of Monaco. Princess Grace has been depicted by many pop artists, including Andy Warhol and James Gill. Warhol made a portrait of her for the Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia as a limited edition silkscreen in 1984.\nIn 2012, Grace's childhood home was made a Pennsylvania historic landmark, and a historical marker was placed on the site. The house, located at 3901 Henry Avenue in the East Falls section of Philadelphia, was built by her father John B. Kelly Sr. in 1929. Grace lived in the house until 1950, and Prince Rainier III proposed to her there in 1955. The Kelly family sold the property in 1974. Prince Albert of Monaco purchased the property, speculating that the home would be used either as museum space or as offices for the Princess Grace Foundation.\nFashion and style.\nWhile pregnant with her daughter Caroline in 1956, Princess Grace was frequently photographed clutching a distinctive leather handbag manufactured by Herm\u00e8s. The purse, or Sac \u00e0 d\u00e9p\u00eaches, was likely a shield to prevent her pregnant abdomen from being exposed to the prying eyes of the paparazzi. The photographs, however, popularized the purse and became so closely associated with the fashion icon that it would thereafter be known as the Kelly bag.\nGrace was inaugurated into the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame in 1960 and in 1955, the Custom Tailored Guild of America listed her as the \"Best-Tailored Woman\". Numerous exhibitions have been held of Kelly's life and clothing. The Philadelphia Museum of Art presented her wedding dress in a 2006 exhibition to mark the 50th anniversary of her marriage, and a retrospective of her wardrobe was held at London's Victoria and Albert Museum in 2010. The V&amp;A exhibition continued in Australia at the Bendigo Art Gallery in 2012. This famous dress, seen around the world, took thirty five tailors six weeks to complete. An exhibition of her life as Princess of Monaco was held at the Ekaterina Cultural Foundation in Moscow in 2008 in conjunction with Monaco's Grimaldi Forum. In 2009, a plaque was placed on the \"Rodeo Drive Walk of Style\" in recognition of her contributions to style and fashion.\nAfter her death, Grace's legacy as a fashion icon lived on. Modern designers, such as Tommy Hilfiger and Zac Posen, have cited her as a fashion inspiration.

Her fashion legacy was even commemorated at the Victoria and Albert Museum of London, where an exhibit titled, \"Grace Kelly: Style Icon\" paid tribute to her impact on the world of fashion. The exhibit included 50 of her legendary ensembles. She is remembered for her \"college-girl\" everyday fashion, defined by her pulled-together yet simple look. In 2016, \"Forbes\" included her on the list \"10 Fashion Icons and the Trends They Made Famous\".\nThe look and style of TV series \"Mad Men\"'s Betty Draper is influenced by Grace Kelly, and she is frequently complimented in the show by other characters for resembling her.

She has a younger brother, Jake, who is a director and screenwriter. Paltrow's father was Jewish, while her mother is Christian. She was raised celebrating \"both Jewish and Christian holidays.\" Her brother had a traditional Bar Mitzvah when he turned 13. Her father's Ashkenazi Jewish family emigrated from Belarus and Poland, while her mother has Pennsylvania Dutch (German) as well as some Irish and English ancestry. Paltrow's paternal great-great-grandfather was a Rabbi in Nowogr\u00f3d, Poland, and a descendant of the well-known Paltrowicz family of rabbis from Krak\u00f3w.\nPaltrow is a half-cousin of actress Katherine Moennig, through her mother, and a second cousin of former U.S. Congresswoman Gabby Giffords (AZ-08) through her father (Giffords' husband is U.S. Senator and retired astronaut Mark Kelly of Arizona). Paltrow's godfather is director Steven Spielberg. Her uncle is opera singer and actor Harry Danner, whose daughter, actress Hillary Danner, is Paltrow's cousin and close friend. Paltrow recalls their family gatherings: \"Hillary and I always had this in common, and to this day ... cooking for people we love, eating, hanging out as a family. It's how we were raised. It's what we do.\" Another cousin is Rebekah Paltrow Neumann, whose spouse is the Israeli-American billionaire Adam Neumann, founder of WeWork.\nPaltrow was raised in Santa Monica, California, where she attended Crossroads School, before enrolling in the Spence School, an all-girls private school in Manhattan. Later, she studied art history at the University of California, Santa Barbara, before dropping out to act. She is an \"adopted daughter\" of Talavera de la Reina (Spain), where at 15, she spent a year as an exchange student and learned to speak Spanish. She is also conversant in French, as her family frequently traveled to the South of France throughout her childhood.\nCareer.\n1989\u20131995: Early work.\nHer career beginnings can be credited to her acting family, as her acting debut was in \"High\" (1989), a TV film her father directed, and after spending several summers watching her mother perform at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in Massachusetts, Paltrow made her professional stage debut there in 1990. Her film debut followed with the musical romance film \"Shout\" (1991), starring John Travolta, and she was cast by her godfather Steven Spielberg in the commercially successful adventure feature \"Hook\" (1991) as the young Wendy Darling. Paltrow's next roles were in the made-for-television movies \"Cruel Doubt\" (1992) and \"Deadly Relations\" (1993).\nHer first plum feature film role was in the noir drama \"Flesh and Bone\" (1993) as the much younger girlfriend of James Caan. Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" described Paltrow as a scene-stealer \"who is Blythe Danner's daughter and has her mother's way of making a camera fall in love with her.\"\nIn 1995, she starred in the thriller \"Seven\", as the wife of a young detective (Brad Pitt), who is partnered with the retiring William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and then tasked with tracking down a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as tropes in his murders. The seventh highest grossing film of the year, \"Seven\" earned her a nomination for the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress. She appeared in \"Moonlight and Valentino\", as a grieving chain-smoker, and in \"Jefferson in Paris\", portraying Martha Jefferson Randolph.\n1996\u20132001: Breakthrough and film stardom.\nIn 1996, Paltrow played the title character in the period film adaptation \"Emma\", based on the 1815 novel of the same name by Jane Austen. Director Douglas McGrath decided to bring in Paltrow to audition for the part of Emma Woodhouse, after a suggestion from his agent and after seeing her performance in \"Flesh and Bone\". On his decision to cast the actress, McGrath revealed: \"The thing that actually sold me on her playing a young English girl was that she did a perfect Texas accent. I know that wouldn't recommend her to most people ... I knew she had theater training, so she could carry herself. We had many actresses, big and small, who wanted to play this part. The minute she started the read-through, the very first line, I thought, 'Everything is going to be fine; she's going to be brilliant.'\" While she recovered from wisdom-tooth surgery, Paltrow had a month to herself to do research for the part; she studied horsemanship, dancing, singing, archery and the \"highly stylized\" manners and dialect during a 3-week rehearsal period. The film was released to critical acclaim and commercial success through arthouse cinemas. \"Variety\" proclaimed: \"Gwyneth Paltrow shines brightly as Jane Austen's most endearing character, the disastrously self-assured matchmaker Emma Woodhouse. A fine cast, speedy pacing, and playful direction make this a solid contender for the Austen sweepstakes.\" Paltrow starred in the crime film \"Hard Eight\".\n1998 marked a turning point in Paltrow's career as she took on leading roles in five high-profile film releases in the year\u2014\"Great Expectations\", \"Sliding Doors\", \"Hush\", \"A Perfect Murder\" and \"Shakespeare in Love\". In the adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel \"Great Expectations\", also starring Ethan Hawke, Robert De Niro, Anne Bancroft and Chris Cooper, she played the unrequited and haughty childhood love of a New York City painter. The British drama \"Sliding Doors\" saw her star as a woman whose life could take two central paths depending on whether or not she catches a train, causing different outcomes. \"Great Expectations\" and \"Sliding Doors\" both grossed over $55\u00a0million worldwide. Paltrow starred opposite Jessica Lange in the thriller \"Hush\", as an unsuspecting woman living with her psychotic mother-in-law. The film made $13.5\u00a0million domestically and was generally panned by critics. In another thriller, \"A Perfect Murder\", inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 film, \"Dial M for Murder\", Paltrow starred alongside Michael Douglas, playing Emily Taylor, who was based on Grace Kelly's character from the original film. Despite a mixed critical response towards \"A Perfect Murder\", the film grossed $128\u00a0million globally. She was also considered for the role of Rose DeWitt Bukater in the 1997 film \"Titanic\".\nHer most critically acclaimed role in the year was that of the fictional lover of William Shakespeare in \"Shakespeare in Love\", opposite Joseph Fiennes in the titular part. \"Entertainment Weekly\" commented, \"Best of all is Gwyneth Paltrow, who, at long last, has a movie to star in that's as radiant as she is.\" \"The New York Times\" summed up her performance as Viola thus: \"Gwyneth Paltrow, in her first great, fully realized starring performance, makes a heroine so breathtaking that she seems utterly plausible as the playwright's guiding light.\" \"Shakespeare in Love\" made $289\u00a0million in box office receipts, and won Paltrow the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role, Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Comedy or Musical, and Academy Award for Best Actress, among other honors. The pink Ralph Lauren dress she wore to the 71st Academy Awards in collecting her Oscar was extremely popular and was credited for bringing pink back into fashion.\nIn 1999, Paltrow co-starred alongside Jude Law, Matt Damon and Cate Blanchett in the psychological thriller \"The Talented Mr. Ripley\", as the fianc\u00e9e of a rich and spoiled millionaire playboy (Law) whose identity is adopted by a con artist (Damon). While \"The Guardian\", noting the \"very underwritten\" female roles in the story, found her to be \"peaky and pallid\", the film received positive reviews and grossed $80\u00a0million in North America. She showcased her singing ability in 2000s \"Duets\", which was directed by her father and co-starred singer Huey Lewis. In the film, about \"the little known world of karaoke competitions and the wayward characters who inhabit it\", she portrayed the estranged daughter of a hustler (Lewis). She performed a cover version of Smokey Robinson's \"Cruisin', which was released as a single and went to number one in Australia, while her rendition of the Kim Carnes classic \"Bette Davis Eyes\" reached number three. Also in 2000, Paltrow co-starred with Ben Affleck in the moderately successful romantic drama \"Bounce\" as Abby Janello.\nShe starred with Jack Black in the comedy \"Shallow Hal\" (2001), about a shallow man falling in love with an overweight woman. Her role required that she wear a specially designed 25-pound fatsuit and heavy makeup. \"Shallow Hal\" opened with $22.5\u00a0million and grossed $70.7\u00a0million in North America and $141.1\u00a0million around the globe. Roger Ebert remarked that she was \"truly touching\" in the film, which he described as \"often very funny, but ... also surprisingly moving at times.\" In the Wes Anderson dramedy \"The Royal Tenenbaums\" (2001), co-starring Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Ben Stiller and Luke Wilson, Paltrow took on the role of the adopted daughter in an estranged family of former child prodigies reuniting with their father. A positive critical response greeted the film upon its release, and it made $71.4\u00a0million worldwide.\n2002\u20132007: Career fluctuations.\nIn 2004, it was noted that since her Oscar win for \"Shakespeare in Love\", Paltrow's film career had been less noteworthy, and critical acclaim had waned. She said she was unequipped for the pressure, leading to several bad film choices, agreeing with peers who believe the win is, in some ways, a curse. During this time, Paltrow rarely appeared in films, having taken a hiatus to raise her two children. In \"The Guardian\", she said she divided her career into movies for love and films for money: \"The Royal Tenenbaums\", \"Proof\", and \"Sylvia\" fell into the former category, while she signed on to \"View from the Top\" and \"Shallow Hal\" for the latter.\nIn 2002, Paltrow made small appearances in the documentary \"Searching for Debra Winger\" and the action satire comedy \"Austin Powers in Goldmember\", while she starred in the thriller-drama \"Possession\" with Aaron Eckhart as a couple of literary scholars who unearth the amorous secret of two Victorian poets as they find themselves falling under a deepening connection. The film made a lukewarm $14.8\u00a0million worldwide. In the following year, she headlined the romantic comedy \"View from the Top\", where she played the part of a woman from a small town who sets out to fulfill her dream of becoming a flight attendant. Budgeted at $30\u00a0million, the film only earned $7\u00a0million in its opening weekend; it eventually grossed $15.6 domestically and $19,526,014 worldwide. She later disparaged the film, calling it \"terrible\". Paltrow starred as the titular role in \"Sylvia\" (2003), a British biographical drama directed by Christine Jeffs and co-starring Daniel Craig chronicling the romance between prominent poets Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes. Distributed for a limited release in most markets, \"Sylvia\" made $2.9\u00a0million internationally. \"The New York Times\", in its review of the film, wrote that \"her performance goes well beyond mimicry. She has a vivid, passionate presence, even when her lively features have gone slack with depression and her bright blue eyes have glazed over.\"\nIn 2004, she starred with her \"The Talented Mr. Ripley\" co-star Jude Law and Angelina Jolie in the science fiction film \"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\". Her role was Polly Perkins, the reporter for the fictional \"New York Chronicle\". Law became one of the film's producers and used his clout to get Paltrow involved. Once she had been suggested for the role, Law did not remember \"any other name coming up. It just seems that she was perfect. She was as enthusiastic about the script and about the visual references that were sort of put to her, and jumped on board.\" She said in an interview, \"I thought that this is the time to do a movie like this where it's kind of breaking into new territory and it's not your basic formulaic action-adventure movie.\" While critical response was positive, with a budget of $70\u00a0million, \"Sky Captain\" only grossed $58\u00a0million at the international box office. Also in 2004, she was recognized as an outstanding woman in entertainment by Women in Film Los Angeles with the Crystal Award.\nIn the drama \"Proof\" (2005), she starred as the depressed daughter of a brilliant, eccentric mathematician (played by Anthony Hopkins). The film was based on the play of the same name, in which Paltrow also played the same character at London's Donmar Warehouse between May and June 2002. On her portrayal in the film version, \"Eye for Film\" remarked: \"As she has already shown in \"Sylvia\", \"The Royal Tenenbaums\" and even \"Sliding Doors\", Paltrow has an uncanny talent for playing women who are coming apart at the seams and her [character] veers from lovably eccentric to more disturbingly unhinged and back again with fluent ease. The scenes, which she and Hopkins share, as two difficult people bound together by affection, dependency, and mutual respect, are entirely believable and all the more touching for it.\" For her performance, Paltrow received her second Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama.\nPaltrow filmed small roles for the 2006 films \"Love and Other Disasters\", \"Running with Scissors\" and \"Infamous\", where she sang Cole Porter's \"What Is This Thing Called Love?\" Her brother Jake Paltrow directed her in his feature debut, the romantic comedy \"The Good Night\" (2007), in which she starred opposite Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Martin Freeman, Danny DeVito and Simon Pegg as the wife of a former keyboard player (Freeman). The film received a two-theater run in North America and garnered mixed reviews from critics. \"View London\" believed the actress was \"clearly only playing her part as a courtesy to her director brother and it just makes you wish she'd go back to playing lead roles again.\"\n2008\u20132013: Marvel Cinematic Universe and revival.\nPaltrow saw a resurgence in her career in 2008 when she was cast in \"Iron Man\" as Pepper Potts, Tony Stark's personal assistant, closest friend, and budding love interest. At first hesitant to appear in a big-budget project, Paltrow asked Marvel to send her any comics they would consider relevant to her understanding of the character, whom she considered to be very smart, levelheaded, and grounded. She said she liked \"the fact that there's a sexuality that's not blatant\". The director Jon Favreau wanted Potts and Stark's relationship to be reminiscent of the 1940s screwball comedy, something which Paltrow considered to be fun in an \"innocent yet sexy\" way. \"Iron Man\" was favorably received by critics, and with a worldwide gross of $585\u00a0million, it became Paltrow's highest-grossing film until \"The Avengers\" (2012). She reprised her role in the sequels \"Iron Man 2\" (2010) and \"Iron Man 3\" (2013). While the second film grossed $623.9\u00a0million internationally, the third entry went on to gross $1.215\u00a0billion. She also reprised the role in ' (2017), ' (2018), and \"\" (2019).\nPaltrow starred opposite Joaquin Phoenix in the romantic drama \"Two Lovers\" (2008), playing the beautiful but volatile new neighbor of a depressed bachelor. \"Two Lovers\" premiered in competition at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival in May, receiving largely positive reviews, especially for Paltrow's and Phoenix's performances. According to the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"Phoenix is at his best with Paltrow's bruised sparrow of a girl; he's desperate to take care of her when he can't even take care of himself. She is one of those actresses who understands the power of a look, and the one of regret and then resignation that overtakes her when Leonard professes his love is steeped in sadness.\" The film was an arthouse success, grossing $16\u00a0million worldwide.\nIn the musical drama \"Country Strong\" (2010), Paltrow starred as an emotionally unstable country music star who attempts to resurrect her career. She recorded the song \"Country Strong\" for the film's soundtrack, and it was released to country radio stations in August 2010. The film received mediocre reviews and grossed a modest $20.2\u00a0million in North America. The consensus of review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes was: \"The cast gives it their all, and Paltrow handles her songs with aplomb, but \"Country Strong\"'s clich\u00e9d, disjointed screenplay hits too many bum notes.\" At the 83rd Academy Awards, Paltrow performed another song from the film, \"Coming Home\", which was nominated for Best Original Song.\nPaltrow made her first scripted television appearance on Fox's \"Glee\", as substitute teacher Holly Holliday, who fills in for Matthew Morrison's character when he falls ill. Her role was developed by co-creator Ryan Murphy, a personal friend of Paltrow's, who suggested that she showcase her vocal and dancing abilities ahead of the release of \"Country Strong\". In her first episode, \"The Substitute\", she sang \"Nowadays\" from the musical \"Chicago\" with Lea Michele, CeeLo Green's \"Forget You\", and a mash-up of \"Singin' in the Rain\" and Rihanna's \"Umbrella\" with Morrison and the rest of the cast. Her debut on \"Glee\" attracted significant buzz and positive commentary from critics; she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series. Indeed, at the time, \"Entertainment Weekly\"'s Tim Stack and \"E! Online\"'s Kristin dos Santos called her appearance Emmy-worthy, with the former rating it among her best performances, and the latter stating that Holly received \"some of \"Glee\"'s best-ever one-liners\".\nPaltrow later performed \"Forget You\" with CeeLo Green himself and several puppet characters provided by The Jim Henson Company at the 2011 Grammy Awards. She reprised her role twice more that season, performing \"Do You Wanna Touch Me (Oh Yeah)\" by Gary Glitter, an acoustic version of \"Landslide\" by Fleetwood Mac, \"Kiss\" by Prince, and Adele's \"Turning Tables\". Paltrow was briefly featured in \"\" after being filmed while she performed \"Forget You\" as Holly in the 2011 Glee Live! In Concert! tour performances of June 16 and 17, 2011. Later that year, Paltrow appeared in Steven Soderbergh's film \"Contagion\", featuring an ensemble cast consisting of Marion Cotillard, Kate Winslet and her \"The Talented Mr. Ripley\" co-stars Matt Damon and Jude Law. The thriller follows the rapid progress of a lethal indirect contact transmission virus that kills within days. Paltrow played Elizabeth Emhoff, a \"working mom\" and one of the virus' first victims. \"Contagion\" received positive reviews and opened atop at the North American box office with $23.1\u00a0million; it went on to gross $75.6\u00a0million domestically and $135.4\u00a0million worldwide.\nPaltrow reprised her role of Pepper Potts in \"The Avengers\" (2012), which set numerous box office records, including the biggest opening weekend in North America; it grossed over $1.5\u00a0billion worldwide, becoming Paltrow's most widely seen film. Also in 2012, she starred in the independent romantic dramedy \"Thanks for Sharing\", opposite Mark Ruffalo as people learning to face a challenging and confusing road as they struggle together against sex addiction. Distributed for a limited release in certain parts of the United States, the film garnered mixed reviews and grossed $1\u00a0million domestically. \"Paste\" magazine noted that her role: \"...exhibits some of the same obsessive diet and exercise habits that Paltrow herself has been accused of\u2014a kind of meta character trait that balances the power in [the main roles'] budding relationship.\"\n2014\u2013present: Acting sporadically.\nIn 2014, Paltrow had a two-episode arc in the improvised online series \"Web Therapy\", as Maya Ganesh, \"a new-age caricature\". In 2015, she starred in \"Mortdecai\", alongside Johnny Depp, Olivia Munn, and Paul Bettany. In it, she portrayed the wife of an unscrupulous art dealer and swindler (Depp). Budgeted at $60\u00a0million, the film only grossed $7.7\u00a0million in North America and $47.3\u00a0million internationally. Paltrow was featured on the track \"Everglow\", which was included in Coldplay's seventh studio album \"A Head Full of Dreams\" (2015).\nIn June 2017, Paltrow announced that she would take a break from acting to focus on her business Goop, stating: \"I'm still going to do a little bit here and there, but [the company] really requires almost all of my time.\" In 2019, Paltrow reprised her role as Pepper Potts in \"\". That same year, she played a supporting role in the Netflix comedy drama series \"The Politician\", playing the mother of Ben Platt's character. In October 2021, Netflix released \"Sex, Love, and Goop\", a sex therapy-themed series produced by and starring Paltrow.\nIn 2023, Paltrow reiterated that her responsibilities with Goop made her less likely to accept acting roles. She will return to acting with Josh Safdie's table tennis drama \"Marty Supreme\", starring Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. The film will be released on December 25, 2025.\nOther ventures.\nPhilanthropy and politics.\nPaltrow is a Save the Children artist ambassador, raising awareness about World Pneumonia Day. She is on the board of the Robin Hood Foundation, a charitable organization that works to alleviate poverty in New York City. In October 2014, she hosted a Democratic fundraiser attended by President Barack Obama at her private residence in Los Angeles.\nIn May 2019, Paltrow and actor Bradley Whitford hosted a fundraiser for Democratic presidential candidate Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\nIn April 2020, Paltrow, along with other celebrities, discussed the COVID-19 pandemic with Dr. Anthony Fauci on a one-hour-long zoom call. Fauci hoped the celebrities would use their social media \"megaphones\" to encourage proper precautions among their followers.\nAudiobooks.\nIn 2009, Paltrow narrated the audiobook \"The Brown Bear &amp; Friends\" by Bill Martin Jr., the first of a series of children's audiobooks that she narrated. \"The Brown Bear &amp; Friends\" earned Paltrow a Grammy Award nomination for Best Spoken Word Album for Children. Since, she has also narrated Bill Martin's \"Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?\", \"Baby Bear, Baby Bear, What Do You See?\", \"Panda Bear, Panda Bear, What Do You See?\", and \"Polar Bear, Polar Bear, What Do You Hear?\".\nFashion.\nIn May 2005, Paltrow became the face of Est\u00e9e Lauder's Pleasures perfume. She appeared in Chicago on August 17, 2007, to sign bottles of the perfume, and on July 8, 2008, she promoted Lauder's Sensuous perfume in New York with the company's three other models. Est\u00e9e Lauder donates a minimum of $500,000 of sales of items from the 'Pleasures Gwyneth Paltrow' collection to breast cancer research. In 2006, she became the face for Bean Pole International, a Korean fashion brand and in 2014, she partnered with Blo Blow Bar, teaming up with the brand's creative branch.\nGoop.\nIn September 2008, Paltrow launched the weekly lifestyle newsletter Goop, encouraging readers to \"nourish the inner aspect\". Goop has expanded into a web-based company, Goop.com. According to Paltrow, the company's name came from someone telling her that successful internet companies have double O's in their name, and \"is a nickname, like my name is G.P., so that is really where it came from. And I wanted it to be a word that means nothing and could mean anything.\" Goop has expanded into e-commerce, collaborating with fashion brands, launching pop-up shops, launching a wellness summit, a print magazine, a podcast, and a documentary series streamed on Netflix.\nGoop, and by extension Paltrow, have faced backlash for showcasing expensive products and promoting medically and scientifically impossible treatments, many of which have harmful consequences. The controversies have included vaginal steaming, the use of jade eggs, a dangerous coffee enema device, and \"Body Vibes\", wearable stickers that were claimed to \"rebalance the energy frequency in our bodies\" and which Goop falsely claimed were made of a NASA-developed material. Goop settled a lawsuit regarding the health claims it made over the jade eggs.\nJill Avery, a brand analyst, has noted how Goop's response to criticism seems designed to \"strengthen their brand and draw their customers closer\", noting Goop's references to feminism, traditional Asian medicines and Eastern philosophies, and anti-establishment politics to do so. Late Show host Stephen Colbert had repeatedly lampooned Goop products; in 2018 Paltrow appeared in a Late Show sketch seemingly making fun of her company's approach.\nOn January 24, 2020, Netflix released \"The Goop Lab,\" a documentary series. The 6-part show promotes Goop, and covers pseudoscientific topics in energy healing, the use of psychedelic drugs, cold therapy, anti-aging, mediumship, and female sexuality. Critics argued that granting Goop access to Netflix's platform was a \"win for pseudoscience\". Upon release of the first trailer, and again after the full six-episode series was available, the series sparked controversy concerning the medical and scientific misinformation it presented.\nOn January 27, 2020, Truth in Advertising watchdog (TINA.org) filed another complaint with the district attorneys of California alleging that Goop has continued to engage in deceptive marketing, even after Goop was sued by the State of California earlier that year and agreed to refrain from \"making any claims regarding the efficacy or effects of any of its products without possessing competent and reliable scientific evidence that substantiates the claims\" for a period of five years. TINA.org's complaint alleges that Goop claims their products are \"clinically-proven\" to treat such symptoms as anxiety, depression, OCD and more.\nIn January 2021, it was announced that Paltrow was an early investor in Thirteen Lune, an e-commerce site focused on makeup, skincare, haircare, and wellness products owned by people of color and ally brands. In April 2021, Goop became Thirteen Lune's first ally brand. Paltrow was also an early investor in Saie, a cosmetics brand.\nFood.\nIn October 2007, Paltrow signed with PBS to make a television series, \"Spain... on the Road Again\", which showcased the food and culture of Spain. In 2008, Paltrow co-wrote the book \"Spain... A Culinary Road Trip\" with Mario Batali. In 2011, she wrote a book titled \"My Father's Daughter: Delicious, Easy Recipes Celebrating Family and Togetherness\". That same year she penned the book \"Notes From the Kitchen Table\". Two years later she published a book titled \"It's All Good: Delicious Easy Recipes That Will Make You Look Good and Feel Great\", which promoted an elimination diet that is unsupported by medical evidence. Included in that book was a recipe for avocado toast which was widely copied and adapted as part of a 2010s food trend. Also in 2013, Paltrow wrote a foreword for a book by Ross Mathews, \"Man Up! Tales of My Delusional Self-Confidence\". In 2016, Paltrow published a cookbook: \"It's All Easy: Delicious Weekday Recipes for the Super-Busy Home Cook\".\nThe negative reaction from a group of scientist and science communication mothers to Paltrow's 2015 video pushing for mandatory labeling of food containing genetically modified organisms led to the creation of a documentary, \"Science Moms\". The film is about mothers who advocate for science-based decision-making concerning the health and nutrition of children.\nIn February 2021 it was reported that Paltrow was suffering from long COVID, leaving her with \"some long-tail fatigue and brain fog\". She advocated treatments for it which involved a \"ketogenic and plant-based\" diet (with no sugar or alcohol), fasting until 11:00 every day, and taking infrared saunas. This advice was criticized by NHS England's Professor Stephen Powis.\nPersonal life.\nIn 2004, Paltrow practiced cupping therapy, attending a film premiere with bruises on her back. As of 2013[ [update]], Paltrow practices Transcendental Meditation.\nIn 2014, Paltrow, whose father was Jewish, was planning to convert to Judaism. In December 2024, she revealed that she celebrates Hanukkah each year with her family.\nIn 1997, Paltrow revealed that during the filming of \"Emma\" (1996), producer Harvey Weinstein made unwanted sexual advances toward her. She confided in her then-fianc\u00e9 Brad Pitt, who confronted the producer at an industry event. Weinstein later warned Paltrow not to tell anyone else. She was, in 2017, a major source for an article written by \"The New York Times\" investigative journalists Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey about Weinstein's sexual abuse cases.\nPaltrow has received backlash from the scientific community and medical professionals for promoting unproven treatments based on pseudoscience through her company Goop.\nRelationships and marriages.\nPaltrow became engaged in December 1996 to actor Brad Pitt, whom she dated from 1994 to 1997. According to Paltrow, they called off the engagement because she was not ready for marriage. She later said that, as this was her first high-profile relationship with another celebrity, it taught her the need for public discretion about her love life.\nPaltrow began dating actor Ben Affleck in October 1997 after meeting at a Miramax dinner, and they worked together on \"Shakespeare in Love\" (1998). Although they split in January 1999, months later Paltrow persuaded Affleck to co-star with her in \"Bounce\" (2000), and they rekindled their relationship. They ultimately broke up in October 2000. In 2015, Paltrow said she and Affleck remain friends.\nIn October 2002, Paltrow met Chris Martin of the British band Coldplay backstage three weeks after the death of her father, Bruce Paltrow. The Coldplay song \"Fix You\", released in September 2005, was written to help Paltrow through her grief. They married on December 5, 2003, at the Santa Barbara County Courthouse. She was pregnant at the time of their wedding. Paltrow and Martin have two children together: a daughter, Apple, born in May 2004, and a son, Moses, born in April 2006. Their son's name was inspired by a song Chris Martin wrote for Paltrow. Simon Pegg and Martin's bandmate Jonny Buckland are her daughter's godfathers.\nPaltrow cut down on work after becoming a mother. She also suffered from postpartum depression after the birth of her younger child in 2006. In March 2014, Paltrow announced that she and Martin had separated after ten years of marriage, describing the process as \"conscious uncoupling\". In her official announcement, Paltrow had her doctor, Habib Sadeghi, and his dentist wife, Sherry Sami, explain conscious uncoupling as \"the ability to understand that every irritation and argument [within a marriage] was a signal to look inside ourselves and identify a negative internal object that needed healing,\" Sadeghi explained. \"From this perspective, there are no bad guys, just two people, it's about people as individuals, not just the relationship\". In April 2015, Paltrow filed for divorce, which was finalized on July 14, 2016.\nIn 2014, Paltrow began dating producer Brad Falchuk, whom she met on the set of \"Glee\" in 2010. The couple went public with their relationship in April 2015 and announced their engagement on January 8, 2018. Their marriage ceremony was held on September 29, 2018, in the Hamptons on Long Island, New York.\nSki crash lawsuit.\nIn January 2019, retired optometrist Terry Sanderson sued Paltrow, claiming that three years earlier she collided with him on a ski slope at Deer Valley Resort in Park City, Utah, causing him permanent traumatic brain injury. Paltrow counter-sued Sanderson that February, claiming that he was the one who crashed into her. She sought nominal damages of one dollar and repayment of her legal fees. At trial in March 2023, Sanderson claimed damages for $300,000. The jury found that Sanderson was at fault, not Paltrow, and awarded Paltrow $1 in damages.\nThe lawsuit was depicted in two separate musicals, \"I Wish You Well: The Gwyneth Paltrow Ski-Trial Musical\" and \"Gwyneth Goes Skiing\" by Linus Karp.\nPublic image.\nAs an actress, Paltrow performed in mainly low-budget films for much of her early career, starring in few blockbusters until the mid-2000s. According to Charles Taylor of \"Salon\", many of these performances were characterized by a \"blas\u00e9\" demeanor that made her endearing yet overall demonstrated \"a promising actress who needed some training to refine her potential\". Similarly, Jose Solis of \"PopMatters\" said, \"When she's good, she's absolutely brilliant, when she's bad, she just seems deeply uninterested\". Many of her characters were wealthy, privileged, and academic, and she was often labeled \"Hollywood royalty\" in the press. Many viewers mistakenly assumed she was British because of her frequent roles as ing\u00e9nues in period films, and some publications have described her feigned British accent as one of the best among non-British actors. She was frequently compared to actress Grace Kelly, with whom she shared \"blondness, refinement, glacial good looks and all-round star quality\", according to \"The Independent\".\nChristina Newland of BBC said Paltrow used her roles throughout the 1990s to cultivate \"an image off and on-screen ... as a chic social butterfly with charm to spare\". She also established herself as a fashion icon, becoming recognized for her minimal style of dressing for public events. In April 2013, Paltrow was named \"People\" magazine's annual \"Most Beautiful Woman\". Film critic Owen Gleiberman described Paltrow as one of the industry's finest actresses in 2011. He was perplexed by readers' negative comments towards her on his reviews of her work, but agreed that her reputation had suffered from a selection of weaker roles and reduced workload. Critic Wesley Morris defended her acting, calling Paltrow among the final generation of movie stars \"for whom stardom and skill seem scarily, thrillingly natural\" and \"for a while, the best young American actor in Hollywood\". Paltrow herself has stated that her passion for acting waned early in her career due to the scrutiny she received as a young actress, with Morris theorizing that she pivoted away from acting towards an industry she could exercise complete autonomy over. In 2019, she claimed to have been only \"masquerading as an actor\" before founding Goop.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"There is something so absurd about Paltrow's image that it seems almost to transcend the disdain you might expect to be levelled at her for such flagrant unworldliness. To many, she's such a caricature of privilege, doing things that are so glossily removed from ordinary life, that she seems to have become a source of amused, even affectionate fascination\".\n\u2014Christina Newland, BBC\nPaltrow has been described as a polarizing and divisive public figure by the media for much her career. Although generally revered as an actress, her subsequent career endeavors as a businesswoman have garnered mixed reviews. Taylor wrote in 2004 that \"No star of the last 10 years has been such a magnet for the neuroses and prejudices of those who watch her than Paltrow\", which the author surmised as due to her being \"rich, white, beautiful and successful\". In 2023, Leanne Delap, a writer for Everything Zoomer, called her \"one of the most divisive personages of our time\", equally beloved and hated. Many of her remarks regarding diet, health, wellness, and wealth have drawn public backlash and mockery, which some critics have used to justify dismissing her as a privileged and \"out of touch\" celebrity. Paltrow has attributed the public's discourse surrounding her to the perception that her success hinges exclusively on the achievements and wealth of her parents, which she has attempted to dispel in interviews. The actress also maintains that the public's shift in favor against her can be traced back to the moment she delivered an emotional acceptance speech when she won her Oscar for \"Shakespeare in Love\" in 1998. Journalist Hadley Freeman believes Paltrow is completely in control of how she is perceived, describing her as a performer who has ingeniously cultivated an overexposed image that allows her career to benefit from being a parody of the modern-day celebrity.\nAccording to entertainment journalist Dylan Howard, \"Inevitably, in a saga of Hollywood, people identify with either the sympathetic character or the villain ... When it comes to Gwyneth Paltrow, she's both the villain and sympathetic figure\". Describing her as \"successful, opinionated and seemingly happy\" in 2013, journalist Tanya Gold attributed her unpopularity \u2013 particularly among women \u2013 to her \"venturing beyond the accepted Hollywood script and expressing her thoughts about clothing, motherhood and nutrition\". Some journalists theorized that Paltrow's brand and reputation benefited from the sympathy she gained during the ski crash trials, as reported by Edward Helmore of \"The Guardian\". \"The Independent\" said \"The very trial that threatened to harm her reputation \u2014 one that has not been exempt from its fair amount of controversies over questionable advice ... ultimately invigorated the Hollywood actor's image in the court of public opinion\". However, Alex Abad-Santos of \"Vox\" argued that, rather than seek sympathy or relatability, Paltrow embraced the stereotypes her detractors had long accused her of perpetuating, ultimately to her own benefit. Paltrow's penchant for wearing understated luxury-brand clothing during the trial also received widespread coverage, inspiring a trend known as \"courtcore\", as coined by \"The New York Times\" fashion journalist Vanessa Friedman.\nIn a 2021 article for \"Vogue\", Keaton Bell defined her as \"one of our last, true A-listers\" whose \"every move consumes daily headlines\", observing that she \"is now better known as a fabulously out-of-touch entrepreneur than an actor, and she seems perfectly fine with that\". In 2023, EJ Dickson of \"Rolling Stone\" reported that Paltrow had largely rehabilitated her image by \"lean[ing] into her own image as an out-of-touch celebutante\", becoming \"regularly heralded as a scrappy, savvy, self-made entrepreneur\". Newland agreed that \"in today's relentlessly critical social media discourse, many find her schtick so over-the-top that they can't help but find it entertaining\". According to Charles Trepany of \"USA Today\", Paltrow's \"calm, unbothered demeanor\" had become virtually synonymous with her brand and public image by 2024.\nActing credits and accolades.\nPaltrow has starred in over 50 films. According to review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Paltrow's most critically acclaimed and commercial successful films include ' (2019), \"Iron Man\" (2008), \"Shakespeare in Love\" (1998), ' (2017), \"The Avengers\" (2012), \"\" (2018), \"Contagion\" (2011), \"The Talented Mr. Ripley\" (1999), \"Emma\" (1996), \"Seven\" (1995), \"Hard Eight\" (1996), \"Two Lovers\" (2008), \"The Royal Tenenbaums\" (2001), \"Iron Man 3\" (2013), \"Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle\" (1994), \"Infamous\" (2006), \"Iron Man 2\" (2010), \"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\" (2004), and \"Flesh and Bone\" (1993).\nPaltrow has received various awards and nominations, including an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, and two Screen Actors Guild Awards. Paltrow received a motion picture star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6900 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "42622", "revid": "41296920", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42622", "title": "European Court of Human Rights", "text": "Supranational court established by the Council of Europe\nThe European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), also known as the Strasbourg Court, is an international court of the Council of Europe which interprets the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The court hears applications alleging that a contracting state has breached one or more of the human rights enumerated in the convention or its optional protocols to which a member state is a party. The court is based in Strasbourg, France.\nThe court was established in 1959 and decided its first case in 1960 in \"Lawless v. Ireland\". An application can be lodged by an individual, a group of individuals, or one or more of the other contracting states. Aside from judgments, the court can also issue advisory opinions. The convention was adopted within the context of the Council of Europe, and all of its 46 member states are contracting parties to the convention. The court's primary means of judicial interpretation is the living instrument doctrine, meaning that the Convention is interpreted in light of present-day conditions.\nInternational law scholars consider the ECtHR to be the most effective international human rights court in the world. Nevertheless, the court has faced challenges with verdicts not implemented by the contracting parties.\nHistory and structure.\nOn 10 December 1948, the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which aims to promote the universal recognition of rights set out therein, in order to strengthen the protection of human rights at the international level. While hugely important in setting a global standard for the first time, the declaration was essentially aspirational, and had no judicial enforcement mechanism. In 1949, the twelve member states of the newly created Council of Europe began work on the European Convention on Human Rights, drawing inspiration from the rights already set out in the Declaration, but with the crucial difference that\u2014for the European countries which chose to sign up to it\u2014there would be a judicial mechanism to ensure that they respected the basic rights of their citizens.\nThe court was established on 21 January 1959 on the basis of Article 19 of the European Convention on Human Rights when its first members were elected by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. Initially, access to the court was restricted by the European Commission of Human Rights, abolished in 1998. The court kept a low profile during its first years and did not accumulate much case law, first finding a violation in \"Neumeister v Austria\" (1968). The convention charges the court with ensuring the observance of the engagement undertaken by the contracting states in relation to the convention and its protocols, that is ensuring the enforcement and implementation of the European Convention in the member states of the Council of Europe.\nAs a court of the Council of Europe.\nThe European Court of Human Rights, which enforces the European Convention on Human Rights, is the best known body of the Council of Europe. The Council of Europe (CoE) (, CdE) is an international organisation founded in the wake of World War II to uphold human rights, democracy and the rule of law in Europe. Founded in 1949, it now has 46 member states, covering a population of approximately 700 million, and operates with an annual budget of approximately 500 million euros.\nThe organisation is distinct from the 27-nation European Union (EU), although it is sometimes confused with it, partly because the EU has adopted the original flag of Europe created by the Council of Europe in 1955, as well as the anthem of Europe. No country has ever joined the EU without first belonging to the Council of Europe. The Council of Europe is an official United Nations observer.\nMember states.\nThe jurisdiction of the court has been recognised to date by all 46 member states of the Council of Europe. On 1 November 1998, the court became a full-time institution and the European Commission of Human Rights, which used to decide on admissibility of applications, was abolished by Protocol 11.\nThe accession of new states to the European Convention on Human Rights following the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 led to a sharp increase in applications filed in the court. The efficiency of the court was threatened seriously by the large accumulation of pending applications.\nIn 1999, 8,400 applications were allocated to be heard. In 2003, 27,200 cases were filed and the number pending rose to approximately 65,000. In 2005, the court opened 45,500 case files. In 2009, 57,200 applications were allocated, with 119,300 pending. At the time, more than 90 per cent of applications were declared to be inadmissible, and the majority of cases decided\u2014around 60 per cent of the decisions by the court\u2014related to what is termed \"repetitive cases\": where the court has already delivered judgment finding a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights or where well established case law exists on a similar case.\nProtocol 11 was designed to deal with the backlog of pending cases by establishing the court and its judges as a full-time institution, by simplifying the procedure and reducing the length of proceedings. However, as the workload of the court continued to increase, the contracting states agreed that further reforms were necessary and in May 2004, the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers adopted Protocol 14 to the European Convention on Human Rights. Protocol 14 was drafted with the aim of reducing the workload of the court and that of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, which supervises the execution of judgments, so that the court could focus on cases that raise important human rights issues.\nJudges.\nJudges are elected for a non-renewable nine-year term. The number of full-time judges sitting in the court is equal to the number of contracting states to the European Convention on Human Rights, currently 46. The convention requires that judges be of \"high moral character\" and have qualifications suitable for high judicial office, or be jurists of recognised competence.\nEach judge is elected by majority vote in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe from among three candidates nominated by each contracting state. Judges are elected whenever a sitting judge's term has expired or when a new state accedes to the convention. The retiring age of judges is 70, but they may continue to serve as judges until a new judge is elected or until the cases in which they sit have come to an end.\nJudges perform their duties in an individual capacity and are prohibited from having any institutional or similar ties with the state in respect of which they were elected. To ensure the independence of the court, judges are not allowed to participate in activity that may compromise the court's independence. Judges cannot hear or decide a case if they have a familial or professional relationship with a party. A judge can be dismissed from office only if the other judges decide, by a two-thirds majority, that the judge has ceased to fulfil the required conditions. Judges enjoy, during their term as judges, the privileges and immunities provided for in Article 40 of the Statute of the Council of Europe.\nThe European Court of Human Rights is assisted by a registry made up of around 640 agents, of which a little less than half of lawyers divided into 31 sections. The registry carries out preparatory work for the judges, and performs the communication activities of the court, with the applicants, the public and the press. The registrar and the deputy registrar are elected by the Plenary Court.\nPlenary court and administration.\nThe plenary court is an assembly of all of the court's judges. It has no judicial functions. It elects the court's president, vice-president, registrar and deputy registrar. It also deals with administrative matters, discipline, working methods, reforms, the establishment of Chambers and the adoption of the Rules of Court.\nThe president of the court, the two vice-presidents (also section presidents) and the three other section presidents are elected by the Plenary Court, Section presidents are elected by the Plenary Court, a formation made up of the 46 elected judges of the court. The mandate of the holders is for a renewable period of three years. They are renowned for their morality and competence. They must be independent and there is incompatibility with other functions. They cannot be revoked by their state of origin, but only by decision of their peers, taken by a two-thirds majority and for serious reasons.\nJurisdiction.\nThe court has jurisdiction amongst the member states of the Council of Europe which includes almost every country in Europe except for Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Russia and Vatican City. The jurisdiction of the court is generally divided into inter-state cases, applications by individuals against contracting states, and advisory opinions in accordance with Protocol No.2. Applications by individuals constitute the majority of cases heard by the court. A committee is constituted by three judges, chambers by seven judges, and a Grand Chamber by 17 judges.\nApplications by individuals.\nApplications by individuals against contracting states, alleging that the state violated their rights under the European Convention on Human Rights, can be made by any person, non-governmental organisation, or group of individuals. Although the official languages of the court are English and French, applications may be submitted in any one of the official languages of the contracting states. An application has to be made in writing and signed by the applicant or by the applicant's representative.\nOnce registered with the court, the case is assigned to a Judge Rapporteur, who can make a final decision on whether the case is inadmissible. A case may be inadmissible when it is incompatible with the requirements of \"ratione materiae\", \"ratione temporis\" or \"ratione personae\", or if the case cannot be proceeded with on formal grounds, such as non-exhaustion of domestic remedies, lapse of the four months from the last internal decision complained of, anonymity, substantial identity with a matter already submitted to the court, or with another procedure of international investigation.\nIf the Judge Rapporteur decides that the case can proceed, the case is then referred to a chamber of the court which, unless it decides that the application is inadmissible, communicates the case to the government of the state against which the application is made, asking the government to present its observations on the case.\nThe chamber of the court then deliberates and judges the case on its admissibility and its merits. Cases that raise serious questions of interpretation and application of the European Convention on Human Rights, a serious issue of general importance, or which may depart from previous case law can be heard in the Grand Chamber if all parties to the case agree to the chamber of the court relinquishing jurisdiction to the Grand Chamber. A panel of five judges decides whether the Grand Chamber accepts the referral.\nInterstate cases.\nAny contracting state to the European Convention on Human Rights can sue another contracting state in the court for alleged breaches of the convention, although in practice this is very rare. As of 2021[ [update]], five interstate cases have been decided by the court:\nAdvisory opinion.\nThe Committee of Ministers may, by majority vote, ask the court to deliver an advisory opinion on the interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights, unless the matter relates to the content and scope of fundamental rights which the court has already considered. Since 2018, member states can similarly request advisory opinions on questions of principle concerning the interpretation or application of the Convention, on the basis of Protocol No. 16. This mechanism aims to foster dialogue between national courts and the ECtHR, thereby preempting Convention violations and minimizing the latter's caseload. Unlike preliminary references under EU law, advisory opinions may only be solicited by the \"highest courts and tribunals\" of a member state. Although Article 5 of Protocol No. 16 states that \"Advisory opinions shall not be binding\", they nonetheless enter the ECtHR's case law and may be enforced through later individual complaints if contravened.\n\"Erga omnes\" effects.\nECtHR rulings have \"erga omnes\" effects (that is, they are potentially binding on all member states), because the court \"determines issues on public-policy grounds in the common interest, thereby extending human rights jurisprudence throughout the community of European Convention States\", although \"erga omnes\" effect \"is not regarded by all States Parties as a legal requirement\".\nProcedure and decisions.\nAfter the preliminary finding of admissibility the court examines the case by hearing representations from both parties. The court may undertake any investigation it deems necessary on the facts or issues raised in the application and contracting states are required to provide the court with all necessary assistance for this purpose.\nThe European Convention on Human Rights requires all hearings to be in public, unless there are exceptional circumstances justifying the holding of a private hearing. In practice the majority of cases are heard in private following written pleadings. In confidential proceedings the court may assist both parties in securing a settlement, in which case the court monitors the compliance of the agreement with the convention. However, in many cases, a hearing is not held.\nThe judgment of the Grand Chamber is final. Judgments by the chamber of the court become final three months after they are issued, unless a reference to the Grand Chamber for review or appeal has been made. If the panel of the Grand Chamber rejects the request for referral, the judgment of the chamber of the court becomes final. The Grand Chamber is made up of 17 judges: the court's president and vice-presidents, the section presidents and the national judge, together with other judges selected by drawing of lots. Grand Chambers include a public hearing, which is transmitted as a webcast on the ECHR site. After the public hearing, the judges deliberate.\nThe court's chamber decides both issues regarding admissibility and merits of the case. Generally, if any claim is found admissible, its merits are dealt with in the same judgment. In final judgments the court makes a declaration that a contracting state has (or has not) violated the convention in respect of each admissible claim, and in case of violation may order the contracting state to pay material and/or moral damages and the legal expenses incurred in domestic courts and the court in bringing the case.\nThe court's judgments are public and must contain reasons justifying the decision. Article 46 of the convention provides that contracting states undertake to abide by the court's final decision. On the other hand, advisory opinions are, by definition, non-binding. The court has to date decided consistently that under the convention it has no jurisdiction to annul domestic laws or administrative practices which violate the convention.\nThe Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe is charged with supervising the execution of the court's judgments. The Committee of Ministers oversees the contracting states' changes to their national law in order that it is compatible with the convention, or individual measures taken by the contracting state to redress violations. Judgments by the court are binding on the respondent states concerned and states usually comply with the Court's judgments.\nChambers decide cases by a majority. Any judge who has heard the case can attach to the judgment a separate opinion. This opinion can concur or dissent with the decision of the court. In case of a tie in voting, the president has the casting vote.\nExhaustion of domestic remedies.\nArticle 35 of the European Convention on Human Rights establishes as a precondition on referral to the European Court of Human Rights, the exhaustion of domestic remedies. This condition is the consequence of the subsidiary jurisdiction of the supranational court, which monitors the application of the convention and seeks to eradicate human rights violations. The applicant must establish the inability of the national courts to remedy the breaches, by exercising the appropriate effective and adequate remedies, and in substance alleging a violation of the Convention.\nInterim measures.\nRule 39 of the Rules of the Court permits the ECtHR to \"indicate to the parties any interim measure which they consider should be adopted in the interests of the parties or of the proper conduct of the proceedings.\" Interim measures are binding and afford litigants temporary protections on an expedited basis, although the ECtHR has chosen to only impose them in cases concerning imminent danger to life and limb. Such measures are often deployed to prevent extradition or expulsion to countries with inadequate human rights guarantees, whereas requests to prevent potentially damaging publications or property seizures seldom elicit similar responses.\nJust satisfaction.\nThe court may award or non-pecuniary damages, called \"just satisfaction\". The awards are typically small in comparison to verdicts by national courts and rarely exceed \u00a31,000 plus legal costs. Non-pecuniary damages are more closely correlated to what the state can afford to pay than the specific harm suffered by the complainant. In some cases, repeated patterns of human rights violations lead to higher awards in an effort to punish the responsible state, but paradoxically in other cases they lead to lower awards, or the cases being struck entirely.\nJudicial interpretation.\nThe court's primary method of judicial interpretation is the living instrument doctrine, meaning that the text of the Convention \"must be interpreted in the light of present-day conditions\" rather than the intent of its framers. In \"Mamatkulov and Askarov v. Turkey\" (2008), the court emphasised that it \"upholds individual rights as practical and effective, rather than theoretical and illusory protections\". Another key part of the Court's interpretation is the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.\nOne area that the living instrument doctrine has changed ECtHR jurisprudence over time is with regard to differential treatment exclusively based on ethnicity, gender, religion, or sexual orientation, which it is increasingly likely to label unjustified discrimination. In addition, with the proliferation of alternative family arrangements, the court has expanded its definition of family under Article 8, for example to same-sex couples, as in \"Oliari and Others v Italy\" (2015). Although defenders argue that living instrument doctrine is necessary for the court to stay relevant and its rulings to adapt to the actual conditions, such interpretations are labeled overreach or judicial activism by critics. At the same time, in academia it is considered that the ECtHR is one of the most pragmatic courts and is in fact not nearly as progressive as other regional human rights courts, such as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.\nMargin of appreciation.\nThe Court uses the doctrine of margin of appreciation, referring to the member states' rights to set moral standards within reason. Over time, the court has narrowed the margin of appreciation (to the point, according to some commentators, of a \"demise\" of margin of appreciation). Narrowing margin of appreciation is a target of criticism for those who believe that the ECtHR should minimise its role, especially from the United Kingdom.\nProponents of a stronger recognition of margin of appreciation cite local conceptions of human rights, specific to the context of each country and its culture, and the risk of handing down judgements that lack local cultural and grassroots legitimacy. Critics argue that the principle of \"emerging consensus\" of the member states on which the ECtHR operates is fundamentally flawed, because such a consensus often relies on trends, and historically in many instances social and political consensus was retrospectively acknowledged to have been wrong.\nSuch an approach is accused of risking stigmatisation and coercion of the few dissenting countries, encouraging a pack mentality. Furthermore, critics argue that the EHtCR has claimed that such consensus exists even when objectively it did not, due to the judicial activism of its judges. It has been said that in failing to distinctly define how a consensus is reached reduces its legitimacy. Furthermore, as the ECtHR grows, the consensus between the members diminishes.\nHowever, the margin of appreciation doctrine has also come under sharp criticism from jurists and academics who say that it undermines the universal nature of human rights.\nProportionality analysis.\nProportionality analysis governs much of the Court's jurisprudence. The guarantees of ECHR Articles 8, 9, 10, and 11 are subject to whatever limitations may be \"necessary in a democratic society\", citing factors including national security, public safety, health and morals, and the rights and freedoms of others. Such conditions require the balancing of individual rights and community interests, as first articulated in the \"Belgian Linguistic Case (No. 2)\". Critics maintain that proportionality engenders largely subjective rulings: a judge's personal preferences and beliefs may colour their perceptions of rights' relative importance. The Court has established certain formulas to ensure consistency across such decisions, but these guidelines cover only a small fraction of its case law.\nRelationship with other courts.\nEuropean Court of Justice.\nThe Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) is not institutionally related to the European Court of Human Rights: the two courts are related to distinct organisations. However, since all EU states are members of the Council of Europe and so are parties of the Convention on Human Rights, there are concerns about consistency in case law between the two courts. The CJEU refers to the case law of the European Court of Human Rights and treats the Convention on Human Rights as if it were part of the EU's legal system since it forms part of the legal principles of the EU member states.\nEven though its member states are party to the convention, the European Union itself is not a party, as it did not have competence to become one under previous treaties. However, EU institutions are bound under Article 6 of the EU Treaty of Nice to respect human rights under the convention. Furthermore, since the Treaty of Lisbon took effect on 1 December 2009, the EU is expected to sign the convention. That would mean that the Court of Justice is bound by the judicial precedents of the Court of Human Rights' case law and so is subject to its human rights law, which would avoid issues of conflicting case law between these two courts. In December 2014, the CJEU released Opinion 2/13 rejecting accession to the Convention.\nDespite the European Union's failure to accede to the Convention, the ECtHR has consistently held that member states are bound by ECHR guarantees even when executing and implementing EU law. Nevertheless, the Court has simultaneously sought to promote international cooperation and avoid interfering in internal Union affairs. It has balanced the conflicting aims of fostering European harmony and avoiding ECHR circumvention via the \"Bosphorus Presumption\", a policy of conditional deference articulated in \"Bosphorus Hava Yollari Turizm ve Ticaret Anonim Sirketi v Ireland\". Because the CJEU represents a \"comparable\" human rights enforcement mechanism, the ECtHR may presume \"that a State has not departed from the requirements of the Convention when it does no more than implement legal obligations flowing from its [EU] membership\". This presumption may be refuted in any particular instances where protections of Convention rights are \"manifestly deficient\".\nNational courts.\nMost of the contracting parties to the European Convention on Human Rights have incorporated the convention into their own national legal systems, either through constitutional provision, statute or judicial decision. The ECtHR increasingly considers judicial dialogue with national courts to be a \"high priority\", especially when it comes to implementation of judgements. According to a 2012 study, the ECtHR tends to justify its decisions with citations to its own case law in order to convince national courts to accept its rulings.\nIn 2015, Russia adopted a law declaring it legal to overrule judgements from the ECtHR, codifying an earlier Russian Constitutional Court decision which ruled that Russia could refuse to recognise an ECtHR decision if it conflicted with the Constitution of Russia, and in 2020 Russia made constitutional amendments stipulating that the Russian Constitution supersedes international law. (In March 2022, due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and a history of disregard for the principles of the Convention, Russia was expelled from the Council of Europe.) Other countries have also moved to restrict the binding nature of the ECtHR judgments, subject to the countries' own constitutional principles. In 2004, the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany ruled that judgements handed down by the ECtHR are not always binding on German courts. The Italian Constitutional Court also restricts the applicability of ECtHR decisions.\nA 2016 book characterises Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Germany, Italy, Poland, and Sweden to be mostly friendly to ECtHR judgements; France, Hungary, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, and Turkey to be moderately critical; the United Kingdom to be strongly critical; and Russia to be openly hostile. In 2019, south Caucasus states were judged partially compliant in a law review article.\nEffectiveness.\nInternational law scholars consider the ECtHR to be the most effective international human rights court in the world. According to Michael Goldhaber in \"A People's History of the European Court of Human Rights\", \"Scholars invariably describe it with superlatives\".\nImplementation.\nThe court lacks enforcement powers. Some states have ignored ECtHR verdicts and continued practices judged to be human rights violations. Although all damages must be paid to the applicant within the time frame specified by the court (usually three months) or else will accumulate interest, there is no formal deadline for any more complex compliance required by the judgement. However, by leaving a judgement unimplemented for a long period of time, brings into question the state's commitment to addressing human rights violations in a timely fashion.\nThe number of non-implemented judgements rose from 2,624 in 2001 to 9,944 at the end of 2016, 48% of which had gone without implementation five years or more. In 2016, all but one of the 47 member countries of the Council of Europe had not implemented at least one ECtHR verdict in a timely fashion, although most non-implemented verdicts concern a few countries: Italy (2,219), Russia (1,540), Turkey (1,342), and Ukraine (1,172). More than 3,200 non-implemented judgements \"concerned violations by security forces and poor detention conditions\".\nCouncil of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, Nils Mui\u017enieks, stated: \"Our work is based on cooperation and good faith. When you don't have that, it's very difficult to have an impact. We kind of lack the tools to help countries that don't want to be helped.\" Russia systematically ignores ECtHR verdicts, paying compensation in most cases but refusing to fix the problem, leading to a high number of repeat cases. Russian legislation has set up a specific fund for paying the claimants in successful ECtHR verdicts.\nNotable non-implemented judgements include:\nAnother issue is delayed implementation of judgements.\nCaseload.\nThe caseload of the court expanded rapidly after the fall of the Soviet Union, growing from fewer than 8,400 cases filed in 1999 to 57,000 in 2009. Most of these cases concern nationals of the former Eastern Bloc where there is less trust in the court system. In 2009, the court had a backlog of 120,000 cases which would have required 46 years to process at the previous rate, leading to reforms. According to the BBC, the court began \"to be seen as a victim of its own success\".\nBetween 2007 and 2017, the number of cases dealt with each year was relatively constant (between 1,280 and 1,550); two-thirds of cases were repetitive and most concerned a few countries: Turkey (2,401), Russia (2,110), Romania (1,341), and Poland (1,272). Repetitive cases indicate a pattern of human rights violations in a given country.\nThe 2010 Interlaken Declaration stated that the court would reduce its caseload by cutting back on the number of repetitive cases it dealt with.\nAs a result of Protocol 14 reforms to reduce caseload, single judges were empowered to reject applications as inadmissible and a system of \"pilot judgements\" was created to handle repetitive cases without a formal finding for each one. Pending applications peaked at 151,600 in 2011 and were reduced to 59,800 by 2019.\nThese reforms led to an increasing number of applications being declared inadmissible or bypassed a ruling under the new pilot procedure. According to Steven Greer, \"large numbers of applications will not, in practice, be examined\", and this situation is qualified as a \"structural denial of justice for certain categories of meritorious applicants whose cases cannot be handled\". Access to justice may also be de facto impeded the lack of legal aid and other factors.\nImpact.\nECtHR rulings have expanded the protection of human rights in every signatory country. Notable rights secured include:\nHonours and awards.\nIn 2010, the court received the Freedom Medal from the Roosevelt Institute in New York. In 2020, the Greek government nominated the court for the Nobel Peace Prize.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Fredriksson had released a number of successful solo albums, while Gessle had been the lead singer and songwriter of Gyllene Tider, a band which had three number one albums in Sweden. Acting on the advice of Rolf Nygren, the CEO of their mutual record label EMI, Fredriksson and Gessle collaborated to record \"Neverending Love\", the first single from Roxette's 1986 debut album \"Pearls of Passion\", which was a hit in Sweden. \nTheir international breakthrough came with the release of \"Look Sharp!\" in 1988. The album contained two \"Billboard\" Hot 100 number-one singles: \"The Look\" and \"Listen to Your Heart\". \"It Must Have Been Love\", from the soundtrack to the 1990 film \"Pretty Woman\", reached number one as well, as did the lead single of their third studio album, 1991's \"Joyride\". That album is Roxette's most successful, selling eleven million copies worldwide. They performed for over 1.5 million people during the \"Join the Joyride! Tour\". Subsequent albums included 1992's \"Tourism\", 1994's \"Crash! Boom! Bang!\", and 1995's greatest hits compilation \"Don't Bore Us, Get to the Chorus!\", which each sold at least five million copies worldwide.\n\"Have a Nice Day\" and \"Room Service\" were released in 1999 and 2001, respectively, and earned numerous gold and platinum awards in Europe and Latin America. Fredriksson was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2002, leading to an extended hiatus. The two then released several solo albums, with Gessle also reuniting with Gyllene Tider. Roxette reformed in 2009 for an extensive world tour, which ran until 2016. During this period, they released the albums \"Charm School\", \"Travelling\", and \"Good Karma\". Fredriksson announced her retirement from touring in 2016 due to poor health and died on 9 December 2019 due to complications from cancer.\nRoxette is Sweden's second-best-selling musical act, after ABBA. They have sold between 75 and 80 million records worldwide, and are recognised as one of the highest-certified acts of all time in Germany, achieving sales of almost six million units. They had nineteen top-40 hits in the United Kingdom, where the British Phonographic Industry awarded them certifications of over three million units. In the US, they achieved four number ones on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and have been certified for over three million units by the Recording Industry Association of America. Since 2021, Gessle has released music under the name PG Roxette; their debut album \"Pop-Up Dynamo!\" was issued in 2022. In 2024, he announced a Roxette tour, with Lena Philipsson hired as vocalist.\nHistory.\n1978\u20131987: Formation and \"Pearls of Passion\".\nPer Gessle and Marie Fredriksson had been friends since 1978. Both musicians had successful careers in Sweden in the early 1980s. Gessle was a member of Gyllene Tider, (English: Golden Ages), whose first two albums each sold at least 150,000 copies in Sweden. In 1981, Fredriksson performed backing vocals on Gyllene Tider's song \"Ingenting av vad du beh\u00f6ver\" (English: \"Nothing of What You Need\"). The following year, Gessle invited Fredriksson to audition for Gyllene Tider's producer Lars-G\u00f6ran \"Lasse\" Lindbom. Lindbom was impressed by Fredriksson's voice, and offered her a recording contract as a solo artist with the Swedish branch of EMI. However, she refused the deal, saying she \"lacked the confidence\" and was \"too nervous\" to be a solo artist. She then joined Lindbom's band as a backing vocalist for an extensive tour of Sweden.\nIn 1984, Fredriksson recorded backing vocals for Gyllene Tider's debut English album \"The Heartland Caf\u00e9\", released in Sweden under the band's original name and in EP format in North America under the name Roxette\u2014derived from the Dr. Feelgood song of the same name. Soon after, Fredriksson began releasing folk-based solo albums, beginning with \"Het vind\" (English: \"Hot Wind\") in 1984. Gessle also turned to solo work, releasing his second Swedish-language solo album, \"Scener\" (English: \"Scenes\"), in 1985, again featuring Fredriksson on background vocals. Fredriksson issued her second solo album, \"Den sjunde v\u00e5gen\" (English: \"The Seventh Wave\"), in February 1986.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"I remember that Per had written a damn good song. I thought Per and Marie would fit together because Per writes very good music and Marie can sing the phone book and it sounds good. Of course, I'm a little proud that I was the one who came up with the idea for Roxette.\"\n\u2014EMI Sweden CEO Rolf Nygren in 2001\nAround this time, the CEO of EMI, Rolf Nygren, suggested Fredriksson and Gessle collaborate together to record a song in English. Fredriksson was warned by friends and industry advisers to not participate with the project, fearing it may impact her burgeoning solo career. Gessle translated a song he wrote called \"Svarta glas\" (English: \"Black Glasses\") into English, which became their first single, \"Neverending Love\". It was released in the summer of 1986 under the name Roxette, and the single sold over 50,000 copies in Sweden. Roxette quickly recorded their debut album, \"Pearls of Passion\", which was issued later in 1986. The album eventually sold over 280,000 copies in Sweden. \"Neverending Love\" and subsequent song \"Soul Deep\" were issued as singles internationally, but failed to chart outside Sweden.\nIn 1987, Roxette issued \"Dance Passion\", a remix album of songs from their debut, and embarked on \"Rock runt riket\" (English: \"Rock Around the Kingdom\"), a co-headlining tour of Sweden with Eva Dahlgren and Ratata. All three acts collaborated to record \"I Want You\", which was released as a non-album single in July. Fredriksson released her third solo album \"Efter stormen\" (English: \"After the Storm\") in October 1987. It was her most successful solo album to date, peaking at number one on the Swedish Albums Chart and being certified platinum by Swedish Recording Industry Association. It won Best Swedish Album at the 1987 Rockbj\u00f6rnen awards, where Fredriksson also won the award for Best Swedish Female.\nLater that year, Roxette released \"It Must Have Been Love (Christmas For the Broken Hearted)\". The song was written by Gessle in response to the German division of EMI asking Gessle to \"come up with an intelligent Christmas single.\" The track was a top five hit in Sweden. However, international divisions of EMI \u2013 including Germany \u2013 chose not to release the song as a single.\n1988\u20131991: International breakthrough.\nIn the duo's native Sweden, \"Dressed for Success\" and \"Listen to Your Heart\" were chosen as the first two singles from their second album \"Look Sharp!\", as Gessle and EMI Sweden chose to highlight Fredriksson's singing. Gessle said, \"I always thought we should promote the songs Marie sang. Me being a lead singer wasn't part of the plan, not for me anyway.\" Both singles reached the top 10 of the Swedish singles chart, while the album, which was released in Sweden in October 1988, held the No.\u00a01 position for 14 weeks. Music critic M\u00e5ns Ivarsson was underwhelmed by the album, writing derisively: \"To consist of two such original persons as Marie Fredriksson and Per Gessle, the album sounds unbelievably conventional. Most striking are the lyrics. Gessle's once so subtle Swedish lyrics have became desolate English nonsense.\" However, the album won Roxette their first Rockbj\u00f6rnen awards in Sweden and Gessle his first Grammis award in the category Best Composer.\nWhen the third single from \"Look Sharp!\", \"The Look\", became another top 10 single in their home country, Roxette were still unknown internationally. While studying in Sweden an American exchange student from Minneapolis, Dean Cushman, heard \"The Look\" and brought a copy of \"Look Sharp!\" home for the 1988 holiday break. He gave the album to a Minneapolis radio station, KDWB 101.3 FM. The station started playing \"The Look\"; based on positive caller feedback, the song became very popular, and quickly spread to other radio stations. The song became a radio hit before any Roxette product had been commercially released or promoted in the US market. The story was covered by radio, newspapers and TV in the US and in Sweden. Fredriksson dismissed rumors that Cushman was paid to take the record to the radio station.\nEMI had previously rejected Roxette as unsuitable for the American market and they did not have a recording contract there, but after the popularity of \"The Look\" in the US, EMI officials made the decision to release and market the single worldwide. \"The Look\" and pressed copies of \"Look Sharp!\" were issued in early 1989 to record stores and radio stations. \"The Look\" became their first No.\u00a01 in the US on 8 April 1989, where it remained for one week. The breakthrough for Roxette became international when the song also topped the charts in 25 other countries, and at the end of the year, \"Billboard\" named \"The Look\" one of the 20 biggest Hot 100 singles of the year.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n \"The Big Bad Ballad. This is us trying to recreate that overblown American FM-rock sound to the point where it almost becomes absurd. We really wanted to see how far we could take it. When it hit big in the States we suddenly found ourselves lumped together with bands like Heart and Starship, which wasn't the intention behind Roxette at all. But we got out of that one... I hope.\"\nGessle, talking about \"Listen to Your Heart\".\n\"Dressed for Success\", featuring Fredriksson on lead vocals with Gessle singing short parts, was the second international single. The single peaked at No.\u00a014 on the Hot 100 as well as at No.\u00a03 in Australia. \"Listen to Your Heart\" was released thereafter; it differed from previous singles and instead resembled the guitar-heavy ballads of Heart. Spending a single week at No.\u00a01 in the US in November 1989, it bore the distinction of being the first US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 No.\u00a01 not to be commercially available on 7-inch vinyl.\nA fourth single, \"Dangerous\", was released at the end of the year, entering the Hot 100 at the end of December. The single, a duet between Gessle and Fredriksson, spent two weeks at No.\u00a02 on the Hot 100 in February 1990, and again becoming a worldwide success by reaching the top 10 in important music markets such as Germany and Australia. \"Dangerous\" was released as a double A-side single in the UK with \"Listen to Your Heart\".\n\"It Must Have Been Love\"\u00a0\u2013 \"Pretty Woman\" soundtrack.\nIt was around this time that Touchstone Pictures approached EMI and Roxette about contributing a song to the soundtrack of an upcoming film, \"Pretty Woman,\" starring Richard Gere and Julia Roberts. Gessle maintained that \"It Must Have Been Love\", by then a two-year-old recording, was chosen because Roxette had no time to compose and record a new song. The film's producers turned it down, asking for another song, but Gessle declined to produce another song. Some weeks later after re-editing the film before release, the producers re-requested \"It Must Have Been Love\", but Roxette had to remove the Christmas lyrics. Gessle and producer Clarence \u00d6fwerman then took the old recording, had Fredriksson replace a single Christmas-reference line in the song and added some instrumentation and background vocal overlays.\nThough it was not the first single released from the soundtrack, \"It Must Have Been Love\" would prove to be Roxette's most successful single release. The song spent two weeks at No.\u00a01 on the Hot 100 in June 1990, three months after the film's release, and stayed for two additional weeks at No.\u00a02, spending a total of seventeen weeks in the top 40. \"Billboard\" named the song the No.\u00a02 Hot 100 single of the year, behind Wilson Phillips's \"Hold On\". The single also topped the charts in more than 20 other countries (including Australia) around the world. In Germany the single spent 9 months in the top 75, and peaked at No.\u00a03 in the UK, the duo's highest singles chart position there. The soundtrack went on to be certified three times platinum by the RIAA.\n1991\u20131992: \"Joyride\".\nAs 1990 wound down, Roxette completed their tour and returned to Sweden to record their follow-up to \"Look Sharp!\" The 15-track collection titled \"Joyride\", which was released in March 1991, became a critical and commercial success. It topped the charts in a number of countries and became Roxette's best-selling album. Their record company EMI invested almost 2 million dollars on promotion for the album, which stayed at No.\u00a01 in Germany for 13 weeks, while staying on the US album chart for over a year. J.D. Considine of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine reviewed \"Joyride\": \"By emphasizing its sense of personality, Roxette delivers more than just well-constructed hooks; this music has heart, something that makes even the catchiest melody more appealing.\" The album's success brought the duo two Rockbj\u00f6rnen awards for Best Swedish Album and Best Swedish Group, the second time they had achieved that feat.\nThe single \"Joyride\" became Roxette's first No.\u00a01 in their home country. It also topped the charts in more than 25 countries around the world, including Germany, Australia and the US; it was their fourth and last No.\u00a01 in the US. The single also charted well in the UK, and achieved success in Canada, which resulted in the song being nominated in 1992 for a Juno Award in the category, Best Selling Single by a Foreign Artist. Its follow-up, \"Fading Like a Flower (Every Time You Leave)\", a power ballad similar to \"Listen to Your Heart\", with Fredriksson on lead, spent a week at No.\u00a02 in the US in July and achieved success in other big markets as well.\nRoxette then embarked on an ambitious worldwide tour. The Join the Joyride! World Tour 1991/92 tour eventually reached more than 1.5 million fans in 107 concerts around the world, including a few dates in the US. On reviewing their Universal Amphitheater performance, Dennis Hunt of the \"Los Angeles Times\" said, \"Fredriksson is squandering her talents in pop's low-rent district. She's clearly superior to Roxette's uncomplicated, hook-crammed material...\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGessle, on the downturn of Roxette in the US\nThe end of 1991 saw the merger of SBK, Chrysalis and EMI record companies, to form EMI Records Group North America. The resulting merger saw many personnel changes that resulted in a downturn in publicity for Roxette. Though \"Joyride\" was certified platinum and made impressive worldwide sales, the subsequent singles from the album\u2014the ballad \"Spending My Time\" and \"Church of Your Heart\"\u2014failed to reach the heights of previous singles in the US charts.\nIn late 1991, the band was honoured with its own postage stamp in Sweden, along with Lena Philipsson and Jerry Williams.\nMusic tastes in the U.S. were changing, with the emergence of new genres such as new jack swing, grunge, harder-core rap and hip-hop. As William Ruhlmann of AllMusic later wrote, \"Americans probably lost interest [in Roxette] at about the time that Nirvana came roaring in from the Northwest.\" In a 2009 interview with BBC News, Gessle highlighted the popularity of Nirvana and grunge music as a contributor to Roxette's downturn in success. Although Roxette's commercial momentum in America was slowing down dramatically, elsewhere, singles from the \"Joyride\" album continued to become hits when \"Spending My Time\" and \"The Big L.\" charted in many countries.\n1992\u20131993: \"Tourism\".\nRoxette continued the \"Join the Joyride\" tour into 1992. It was during this tour that most of the material for \"Tourism: Songs from Studios, Stages, Hotelrooms &amp; Other Strange Places\" was recorded. Instead of releasing an album of brand-new material, Gessle and Fredriksson re-mastered older recordings, including several slated for, but not included on, \"Look Sharp!\" and \"Joyride\". They also recorded some of their live performances, recorded a country music-inspired version of \"It Must Have Been Love\" in a Los Angeles studio, and recorded new material in various locations around the world\u00a0\u2013 an empty dance club, a hotel room\u00a0\u2013 and compiled everything on to the album. Released in October 1992, Gessle and Fredriksson said \"Tourism\" was meant to \"capture the energy within the band\".\nThe first single off the album was \"How Do You Do!\" followed by the ballad \"Queen of Rain\" and an electrified version of the song \"Fingertips\", originally recorded acoustically for the album and re-titled \"Fingertips '93\" for single release. Singles from \"Tourism\" barely dented the American radio and record charts but in the rest of the world, the first single \"How Do You Do!\", hit the top 5 in most European and South American countries. The album \"Tourism\" also charted well outside of the US, reaching No.\u00a01 in Germany and Sweden, No.\u00a02 in the UK as well as peaking at No.\u00a03 in Australia. The album sold 6 million copies worldwide. The duo's success reflected in an ECHO Award nomination for International Group of the Year. At home, Roxette won a Rockbj\u00f6rnen Award for Best Swedish Group. It remains the last Rockbj\u00f6rnen the duo received. In October 1992, Fredriksson released her first solo album in Swedish for five years, titled \"Den st\u00e4ndiga resan\" (\"The Eternal Journey\").\nIn early 1993, Roxette became the first non-native-English speaking artists to be featured on MTV's \"Unplugged\" series, though the songs from the performance were never released on an official \"Unplugged\" album. In the same year, Roxette recorded and released \"Almost Unreal\", a song originally slated for the film \"Hocus Pocus\" starring Bette Midler. However, the song was moved to the soundtrack of the film based on the Nintendo video game \"Super Mario Bros.\" Supported by an expensive video and ultimately receiving respectable airplay, \"Almost Unreal\" managed to briefly reach the lower end of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 but charted highest in the UK reaching the top 10, the group's first time there since \"Joyride\" two years before. Roxette themselves were dismissive about the song, with Fredriksson saying it was \"not one of our most inspired moments.\" On the other hand, Gessle stated: \"I still like the song in a way... but if you wanted to make a parody of Roxette, it would probably sound something like this.\" To coincide with the UK television premiere of the film \"Pretty Woman\", \"It Must Have Been Love\" was re-issued in September 1993 and entered the UK and Irish singles charts for the second time.\n1994\u20131998: \"Crash! Boom! Bang!\" and \"Don't Bore Us, Get to the Chorus!\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"MF: It was just before Christmas '93 and we were listening to the first playback of the \"Crash! Boom! Bang!\" album and realized we were all missing something. It all sounded so... perfectly grown up. PG: We had worked for a year, much too long, endless hours of studio time... I mean, I loved it but there was too little P-O-P.\"\nRoxette, on the first playback of \"Crash! Boom! Bang!\"\n Roxette changed their musical style with the 1994 release of \"Crash! Boom! Bang!\" Bryan Buss of Allmusic wrote, \"They rock harder than on their pop-friendly albums prior to this, and the result shows growth but not the fun that made them so popular in the first place... Though the two have an edge on this album, they almost seem to have become a bit bored.\"\nAlthough \"Crash! Boom! Bang!\" saw chart success (No.\u00a01 in Sweden, No.\u00a02 in Germany and No.\u00a03 in Australia and the UK), it sold fewer copies than had their previous albums, selling 5 million copies worldwide. EMI America were reluctant to release the album, and instead promoted a shortened 10-track \"Favorites\" CD in association with McDonald's. The \"Favorites of Crash! Boom! Bang!\" CD reportedly sold about 1 million copies. It was noted by journalists that the McDonald's promotion CD (and other CDs by Tina Turner, Garth Brooks and Elton John) led to US music retailers of the time being unhappy with the promotion for several reasons, including that it bypassed established music stores and that the price of the CD was way below normal wholesale costs. Some stores refused to sell the albums published by EMI, with one major chain protesting by temporarily pulling all products from CEMA (EMI's distribution wing) out of its sales and ad campaigns. The duo's relations with EMI's North American subsidiary, which had never been smooth, collapsed after the release of this album. \"Crash! Boom! Bang!\" became the last Roxette release EMI issued in the US until \"Greatest Hits\" was released in 2011 on subsidiary label Capitol Records.\nThe first single release from \"Crash! Boom! Bang!\" was \"Sleeping in My Car\". The distortion guitar-heavy pop song, born out of anger and frustration of the album's grown up nature, reached No.\u00a02 in Canada, as well as the top 10 in 7 European countries (including No.\u00a01 in Sweden) as well as the top 15 in the UK, Australia and Germany. However, in the US, it was less successful, reaching only No. 50 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart. Subsequent releases--the album's title selection, \"Fireworks\", and \"Run to You\"\u2014were less successful but managed to reach the charts in some countries.\nRoxette then embarked on another, albeit scaled-down, worldwide tour, skipping North America in the process. The \"Crash! Boom! Bang! Tour\" saw Roxette becoming the first Western band to be allowed to perform in China (Workers' Indoor Arena, Beijing) since Wham! in 1985. The procedure to get permission for this concert took over a year, and included self-censorship of lyrics. In 2008 they were ordered to pay 4.5 million kronor in unpaid taxes to the Swedish Tax Agency, for money earned during the German part of the 1994/95 tour.\nIn October 1995, Roxette released their first greatest hits compilation, \"Don't Bore Us, Get to the Chorus!\" This reached the top 5 in many European countries, including the UK, as well as the top 10 in Australia. The compilation sold 6 million copies worldwide, and featured four new songs, three of which were released as singles, including the ballad \"You Don't Understand Me\", co-written by Desmond Child. Also that year, a compilation of demos, B-sides and remixes, alongside some of the 1993 \"MTV Unplugged\" material, was released in Japan and parts of South America under the title \"Rarities\".\nGessle briefly reunited with Gyllene Tider in 1996, then Roxette took instrumental masters of many of its ballads and recorded translated Spanish lyrics over them. The resulting album, \"Baladas En Espa\u00f1ol\", sold well in Spanish-speaking regions, reaching 2\u00d7\u00a0platinum in Spain and platinum in Argentina. The single \"Un d\u00eda sin ti\" (\"Spending My Time\") accompanied by a video directed by Jonas \u00c5kerlund, became their first Latin Pop Airplay chart entry. The duo then released solo albums, \"I en tid som v\u00e5r\" (\"In a Time Like Ours\") by Fredriksson and \"The World According to Gessle\" by Gessle, with both charting in Sweden.\n1999\u20132001: \"Have a Nice Day\" and \"Room Service\".\nGessle and Fredriksson reunited in 1998 to record material for a new Roxette album, \"Have a Nice Day\", which was released in February 1999 and gave Roxette a comeback in continental Europe. It entered at No.\u00a01 in Sweden and No.\u00a02 in Germany. The first single, \"Wish I Could Fly\", became their highest-charting UK single since 1993 (No.\u00a011). In Sweden it charted at No.\u00a04, their best position since \"Sleeping in My Car\". Although the second single, \"Anyone\", did not chart well in Europe, \"Stars\", the third single, charted well in Scandinavian and German-speaking countries. \"NME\"'s review called \"Have a Nice Day\" \"...another clever-clever bastard of an album which defies Doctor Rock.\" A review of \"I Wish I Could Fly\" written by H\u00e5kan Steen of \"Aftonbladet\" said, \"The come-back single is a disappointment. The lyrics, which convey a sense of distance in a relationship, are not particularly engaging.\" The album, according to \"Billboard\" magazine, was under discussion for release in the US, but ultimately, it was not released there.\nIn 2000, Fredriksson released a \"greatest hits\" compilation called \"\u00c4ntligen\" (\"At Last\"), which went on to be a big seller in Sweden, peaking at No.\u00a01 for three weeks. Meanwhile, Roxette signed a US distribution deal with Edel Music, which re-released \"Don't Bore Us, Get to the Chorus!\" In doing so, it replaced some non-US hits with songs from \"Have a Nice Day\". To promote the release the duo did a small tour of The United States, performing at the Boston Mixfest and at the Virgin Megastore in Times Square. The single \"Wish I Could Fly\", included on the album, reached No.\u00a027 on the \"Billboard\" Adult Contemporary chart and No.\u00a040 on the Adult Top 40 chart.\n\"Room Service\" followed in 2001, to a mixed response from critics. \"Probably the best Roxette album since \"Joyride\",\" wrote Leslie Mathew of Allmusic, \"\"Room Service\" is an exciting, immediate, high-gloss pop gem that contains very little filler indeed.\" Per Bjurman from Swedish tabloid \"Aftonbladet\" was critical of the album. \"It is not very good.\" he wrote. He did praise the three singles, \"Real Sugar\", \"The Centre of the Heart\", and \"Milk and Toast and Honey\", but he ended the review with the prediction: \"Roxette is not finished. But soon, I suspect.\"\nThe album topped the Swedish charts and reached No.\u00a03 in Germany, but it received little attention in the UK. A planned US release through Edel America Records did not happen as the label was disbanded due to financial difficulties, though it did peak at No.\u00a02 on CNN's Worldbeat album chart. The first single, \"The Centre of the Heart\" topped the charts in Sweden, made the top 10 in Spain, and the top 15 in Finland. The other singles, \"Real Sugar\", the album's opening track and \"Milk and Toast and Honey\" were less successful. Roxette again went on tour, this time in Europe only, as concerts planned in South Africa were cancelled after the 11 September 2001 attacks. On reviewing their L\u00f6fbergs Lila Arena concert, Bjurman from \"Aftonbladet\" wrote, \"Roxette succeed in all cases, to never leave the 80s.\" His review criticised Roxette's playlist, which consisted of some of their early hits. Johan Lindqvist from \"G\u00f6teborgs-Posten\" was more positive, scoring their Munich concert four stars out of five.\n2002\u20132008: Fredriksson's illness, compilation albums and solo work.\nRoxette received an honorary award from the Swedish government at the February 2002 Grammis ceremony. On 11 September 2002, Fredriksson had an epileptic seizure and fractured her skull after collapsing in her bathroom. Following MRI scans, it was confirmed that Fredriksson had a brain tumour. The diagnosis led to the cancellation of Roxette's planned performance at the 2002 Night of the Proms concert series. After waiting several weeks for the fracture to subside, she underwent surgery to remove the malignant tumour, followed by months of chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Fredriksson was unable to speak for a considerable period of time afterward, and for the rest of her life was unable to read, was blind in one eye, and had limited hearing and mobility.\nRoxette issued two greatest hits compilations, \"The Ballad Hits\" in late 2002 and \"The Pop Hits\" in early 2003. On December 1, 2002, a 600-page discography book titled \"The Look for Roxette\" was released, which included a four-song EP of previously unreleased material. The release of \"The Ballad Hits\" was delayed until Valentine's Day 2003 in English-speaking territories such as Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In January 2003, Roxette received the Litteris et Artibus (\"Culture and Education\") award from King of Sweden Carl Gustaf XVI, for \"achievements in Sweden and internationally\". \"The Ballad Hits\" sold over a million copies within a year, and was the best-selling album released by a Scandinavian act that year. The duo received a World Music Award for Best-Selling Scandinavian Artist in October 2003. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n \"They were a legitimately popular band, but they don't fit neatly into the story of American pop music. The Swedish duo wasn't a boy band like New Kids on the Block, they weren't glammy enough to be hair metal, and vocalist Marie Fredriksson didn't have the outsize personality to be a diva like Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, or Janet Jackson. They were far from the only guitar-based pop act on the airwaves in the '80s, but they came too late to be mentioned alongside Journey, Survivor, or REO Speedwagon, and they didn't have the rock legacy of Heart or Starship.\"\n Chris Conaton from \"PopMatters\" reviewing \"Greatest Hits\"\nIn 2003, Gessle released \"Mazarin\" (\"Cake\"), which became his most successful solo album. The record sold over 335,000 copies in Sweden as of January 2005, and received numerous awards. Gyllene Tider reformed to celebrate their 25th anniversary in 2004, releasing the studio album \"Finn 5 fel!\" (\"Find 5 Errors!\") in June, their first new material since 1996. That album was also successful, selling 230,000 copies in Sweden by January 2005. \nFredriksson released her first English-language solo album, \"The Change\", in October 2004, which debuted atop the Swedish albums chart. Despite being unable to read or write, Fredriksson rediscovered her love of drawing during her illness, and began using charcoal to create artwork as a form of therapy. She drew the cover art for \"The Change\", and held her first art exhibition \u2013 titled \"After the Change\" \u2013 at the vernissage of the Doktor Glas gallery in Kungstr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden, Stockholm in October 2005. The following month, Gessle released his second English-language studio solo album, \"Son of a Plumber\".\nAlso in 2005, several remixes of Roxette songs became hit singles. A remix of \"Fading Like a Flower\" by Dancing DJs was a top twenty hit in the UK, while Belgian dance group DHT's 2003 trance cover of \"Listen to Your Heart\" became a top ten hit on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and was certified gold by the RIAA. \nFredriksson released her seventh solo album in June 2006, an album of Swedish cover songs titled \"Min b\u00e4ste v\u00e4n\" (\"My Best Friend\"). To commemorate their 20th anniversary, Roxette issued the four-disc box set \"The Rox Box/Roxette 86\u201306\" on 18 October 2006. The set also included a DVD containing all their music videos and a previously unreleased 1993 concert for \"MTV Unplugged\". Roxette recorded two new songs for the box set, \"One Wish\" and \"Reveal\", which both featured on a new greatest hits album, \"\", released on the same date as \"The Rox Box\". Gessle released two more solo albums: \"En h\u00e4ndig man\" (\"A Handy Man\") in 2007 and \"Party Crasher\" in 2008.\n2009\u20132016: Reformation, touring and studio albums.\nRumours of a Roxette reunion began in April 2009 when Gessle was interviewed by the BBC, where he said he world \"love to do more Roxette and I would love to do more recordings as well, because [Marie is] a great person and a great singer, but I don't want to push her at all. It's really up to her. If she calls me up and tells me 'I'm ready', I'd say 'Let's go for it'.\" Fredriksson joined Gessle on stage during the 6 May 2009 date of Gessle's \"Party Crasher Tour\" in Amsterdam. Immediately after the concert, Gessle announced to Swedish publication \"Aftonbladet\" that Roxette would perform at the 2009 edition of Night of the Proms. Roxette was scheduled to perform at the 2002 edition of the tour, but withdrew because of Fredriksson's illness. The tour began on 23 October 2009 and consisted of 42 dates in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. On the same date the tour began, Gessle confirmed to Swedish newspaper \"Expressen\" that Roxette had been recording material for a new album since May.\nIn 2010, the band performed a series of warm-up concerts in Europe, along with a June concert at the Stockholm Concert Hall for the Wedding of Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden, and Daniel Westling. Roxette embarked on \"The Neverending World Tour\" at the beginning of 2011, an extensive worldwide tour. Their eighth studio album, \"Charm School\", was released on 11 February 2011, preceded by lead single \"She's Got Nothing On (But the Radio)\" on 10 January. The song was Roxette's highest-peaking single in Germany since 1992's \"How Do You Do!\", while the album was their first since 1992's \"Tourism\" to peak at number one in Germany. The album was certified gold and peaked within the top twenty of numerous European territories. It sold half a million copies worldwide by the end of 2011.\nDuring \"The Neverending World Tour\", Roxette recorded \"Travelling\", an album of new studio recordings, live tracks and soundcheck performances. The album was issued in March 2012, and was preceded by \"It's Possible\" as the lead single. The song was A-listed on BBC Radio 2. By April 2012, Roxette had performed to over a million people during \"The Neverending World Tour\". In 2013, Gessle reunited with Gyllene Tider. The band embarked on a tour of large arenas and stadiums in Sweden, and released the album \"Dags att t\u00e4nka p\u00e5 refr\u00e4ngen\" (\"Time to Think About the Chorus\"). That same year, Fredriksson issued the solo album \"Nu!\" (\"Now!\"), and also embarked on a solo tour of Sweden. Roxette issued their first live album in late 2013, \"\", which was also issued as part of a DVD and Blu-ray box set.\nRoxette resumed touring in late 2014. They issued another greatest hits compilation, \"Roxette XXX \u2013 The 30 Biggest Hits\", from late 2014, while an updated version of their 2006 box set \"The Rox Box/Roxette 86\u201306\", titled \"\", was released in Australia in early 2015. They continued touring in 2015, and in July released \"The Look (2015 Remake)\", a new recording of their 1988 single. French DJ Sebastien Drums created a remix and music video for a new Roxette song titled \"Some Other Summer\", which was released in late 2015. \"Roxette Diaries\", a documentary directed by Jonas \u00c5kerlund, was released on video on demand services in March 2016. The following month, Fredriksson announcing her retirement from touring. She was advised by doctors to stop all touring activity, due to poor health. She issued a statement saying: \"Sadly, now my touring days are over and I want to take this opportunity to thank our wonderful fans that [have] followed us on our long and winding journey.\" By the end of the tour, Roxette had performed to 2.5 million people (excluding music festival appearances) in over 50 countries.\nRoxette's tenth and final studio album, \"Good Karma\", was released in June 2016. The album is more electronic than the other albums the duo released following their reformation. It was produced by Gessle alongside regular producers Clarence \u00d6fwerman and Christoffer Lundquist, and Swedish duo Addeboy vs. Cliff, with whom Roxette had collaborated on the 2015 remix of \"The Look\". Three singles were released from the album: \"It Just Happens\", \"Some Other Summer\", and \"Why Don't You Bring Me Flowers?\".\n2017\u20132023: Fredriksson and Alsing's deaths, vault releases and PG Roxette.\nFredriksson and Gessle resumed solo work following the release of \"Good Karma\". Gessle released two Swedish-language solo albums in 2017, \"En vacker natt\" (\"A Beautiful Night\") and \"En vacker dag\" (\"A Beautiful Day\"). His tenth solo album, \"Small Town Talk\", was released in 2018, and consisted of English versions of songs from \"En vacker natt\" and \"En vacker dag\". All three records were recorded in Nashville. Fredriksson released the non-album singles \"Alone Again\" and \"I Want to Go\" in 2017, and \"Sing Me a Song\" in 2018. Roxette issued a 30th-anniversary edition of \"Look Sharp!\" in October 2018, containing a bonus disc of previously unreleased outtakes and demos. Gessle toured Europe in October and November 2018 as \"Per Gessle's Roxette\", with Helena Josefsson as vocalist and set lists for the tour consisting primarily of songs from Roxette's back catalogue.\nMarie Fredriksson died on 9 December 2019, at the age of 61. Her cause of death was not initially specified, but it was later confirmed she died from complications stemming from her 2002 brain tumour diagnosis. Paying tribute to Fredriksson, Gessle said she was \"the most wonderful friend for over 40 years\", and \"an outstanding musician, a master of the voice, an amazing performer.\" Gessle released his eleventh studio album, \"Gammal k\u00e4rlek rostar aldrig\" (\"Old Love Never Rusts\"), in November 2020. A four-disc compilation of Roxette outtakes titled \"Bag of Trix\" was released the following month. An outtake from the \"Good Karma\" sessions, \"Let Your Heart Dance with Me\", was issued as the lead single from the compilation two months earlier. It was one of the final songs Fredriksson recorded before her death. On 19 December 2020, Roxette's longtime drummer Pelle Alsing died at the age of 60.\nIn 2021, Roxette released a 30th-anniversary edition of \"Joyride\", containing two bonus discs of previously unreleased outtakes and demos. That same year, Gessle created a new project called PG Roxette. The band features Gessle alongside vocalists Helena Josefsson and Dea Norberg, who had both provided vocals on Gessle's previous work, either on his solo material or as backing vocalists on Roxette's live shows. The band's first release was a cover of the Metallica song \"Nothing Else Matters\", released on \"The Metallica Blacklist\" in September 2021. The following year, Roxette digitally issued a triple volume compilation of remixes titled \"ROX RMX (Remixes from the Roxette Vaults)\". PG Roxette released their debut album, \"Pop-Up Dynamo!\", in October 2022, with a 4-track EP titled \"Incognito\" following in 2023.\n2024\u2013present: Live reformation and musical.\nOn 2 May 2024, Gessle announced the live reformation of Roxette. With Lena Philipsson taking over on lead vocals, the band will tour Australia and South Africa from February 2025. A 3-CD box set of \"ROX RMX (Remixes from the Roxette Vaults)\" was released in September 2024. A musical titled \"Joyride the Musical\", based on Roxette's music and Jane Fallon's book \"Got You Back\", will run at Malm\u00f6 Opera from September 2024 until April 2025.\nImpact and legacy.\nRoxette is Sweden's best-selling music act after ABBA. Roxette have sold between 75 and 80 million records worldwide. They sold over 5.7 million records in Germany, where they are recognised as one of the highest-certified acts of all time. In the United Kingdom, Roxette had nineteen top 40 hits, and the British Phonographic Industry have certified the band for shipments of over 3 million units.\nIn the United States, the RIAA awarded them certifications of 3.5 million units. They have sold over two million albums in the country since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales data in May 1991. Roxette achieved four number one singles on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100: \"The Look\", \"Listen to Your Heart\", \"It Must Have Been Love\" and \"Joyride\". Gessle is the sole-credited writer on three of these songs, making him one of the most successful solo songwriters on \"Billboard\" Hot 100 history. Roxette songs continue to receive extensive airplay. In 2014, both \"Listen to Your Heart\" and \"It Must Have Been Love\" received awards from music publisher Broadcast Music, Inc., after each song had been played on US radio five million times. \"It Must Have Been Love\" received an updated award in 2021, following its six millionth play.\nAwards.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Awards table/styles.css\" /&gt;\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Nominee / work\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "42626", "revid": "9023670", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42626", "title": "Serial killer", "text": "Murderer of multiple people\nA serial killer (also called a serial murderer) is an individual who murders three or more people, with the killings taking place over a period of more than one month in three or more separate events. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) states that the motives of serial killers can include anger, thrill-seeking, attention seeking, and financial gain, and killings may be executed as such. The victims tend to have things in common, such as demographic profile, appearance, gender, or race. As a group, serial killers suffer from a variety of personality disorders. They are often not adjudicated as insane under the law. Although a serial killer is a distinct classification that differs from that of a mass murderer, spree killer, or contract killer, there are overlaps between them.\nEtymology and definition.\nThe English term and concept of \"serial killer\" are commonly attributed to former Federal Bureau of Investigation special agent Robert Ressler, who used the term \"serial homicide\" in 1974 in a lecture at Police Staff College, in Bramshill, Hampshire, England. Author Ann Rule postulates in her 2004 book \"Kiss Me, Kill Me\", that the English-language credit for coining the term goes to Los Angeles Police Department detective Pierce Brooks, who created the Violent Criminal Apprehension Program (ViCAP) system in 1985.\nThe German term and concept were coined by criminologist Ernst Gennat, who described Peter K\u00fcrten as a ' ('serial-murderer') in his article \"\" (1930). In his book, ' (2004), criminal justice historian Peter Vronsky notes that while Ressler might have coined the English term \"serial homicide\" within the law in 1974, the terms \"serial murder\" and \"serial murderer\" appear in John Brophy's book \"The Meaning of Murder\" (1966). The Washington, D.C., newspaper \"Evening Star\", in a 1967 review of the book:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There is the mass murderer, or what he [Brophy] calls the \"serial\" killer, who may be actuated by greed, such as insurance, or retention or growth of power, like the Medicis of Renaissance Italy, or Landru, the \"bluebeard\" of the World War I period, who murdered numerous wives after taking their money.\nVronsky states that the term \"serial killing\" first entered into broader American popular usage when published in \"The New York Times\" in early 1981, to describe Atlanta serial killer Wayne Williams. Subsequently, throughout the 1980s, the term was used again in the pages of \"The New York Times\", one of the major national news publications of the United States, on 233 occasions. By the end of the 1990s, the use of the term had increased to 2,514 instances in the paper.\nWhen defining serial killers, researchers generally use \"three or more murders\" as the baseline, considering it sufficient to provide a pattern without being overly restrictive. Independent of the number of murders, they need to have been committed at different times, and are usually committed in different places. The lack of a cooling-off period (a significant break between the murders) marks the difference between a spree killer and a serial killer. The category has, however, been found to be of no real value to law enforcement, because of definitional problems relating to the concept of a \"cooling-off period.\" Cases of extended bouts of sequential killings over periods of weeks or months with no apparent \"cooling off period\" or \"return to normality\" have caused some experts to suggest a hybrid category of \"spree-serial killer\".\nIn \"Controversial Issues in Criminology\", Fuller and Hickey write that \"[t]he element of time involved between murderous acts is primary in the differentiation of serial, mass, and spree murderers\", later elaborating that spree killers \"will engage in the killing acts for days or weeks\" while the \"methods of murder and types of victims vary\". Andrew Cunanan is given as an example of spree killing, while Charles Whitman is mentioned in connection with mass murder, and Jeffrey Dahmer with serial killing.\nIn 2005, the FBI hosted a multi-disciplinary symposium in San Antonio, Texas, which brought together 135 experts on serial murder from a variety of fields and specialties with the goal of identifying the commonalities of knowledge regarding serial murder. The group also settled on a definition of serial murder which FBI investigators widely accept as their standard: \"The unlawful killing of two or more victims by the same offender(s) in separate events\". Serial homicide researcher Enzo Yaksic found that the FBI was justified in lowering the victim threshold from three to two victims given that serial murderers from these groups share similar pathologies.\nHistory.\nEarly accounts.\nHistorical criminologists suggest that there have been serial killers throughout history. Some sources suggest that legends such as werewolves and vampires were inspired by medieval serial killers. In Africa, there have been periodic outbreaks of murder by leopard men. \nLiu Pengli of China, nephew of the Han Emperor Jing, was made Prince of Jidong in the sixth year of the middle period of Jing's reign (144\u00a0BC). According to the Chinese historian Sima Qian, he would \"go out on marauding expeditions with 20 or 30 slaves or with young men who were in hiding from the law, murdering people and seizing their belongings for sheer sport\". Although many of his subjects knew about these murders, it was not until the 29th year of his reign that the son of one of his victims finally sent a report to the emperor. Eventually, it was discovered that he had murdered at least 100 people. The officials of the court requested that Liu Pengli be executed; however, the emperor could not bear to have his own nephew killed, so Liu Pengli was made a commoner and banished. \nIn the 9th century (year 257 of the Islamic Calendar), \"a strangler from Baghdad was apprehended. He had murdered a number of women and buried them in the house where he was living.\"\nInside and outside the United States.\nThe majority of documented serial killers were active in the United States. In one study of serial homicide in South Africa, many patterns were similar to established patterns in the U.S., with some exceptions: no offenders were female, offenders were lower educated than in the U.S., and both victims and offenders were predominantly black. \nIn the 15th century, one of the wealthiest men in Europe and a former companion-in-arms of Joan of Arc, Gilles de Rais, was alleged to have sexually assaulted and killed peasant children, mainly boys, whom he had abducted from the surrounding villages and had taken to his castle. It is estimated that his victims numbered between 140 and 800. Similarly, the Hungarian aristocrat Elizabeth B\u00e1thory, born into one of the wealthiest families in Transylvania, allegedly tortured and killed as many as 650 girls and young women before her arrest in 1610.\nBetween 1564 and 1589, German farmer Peter Stumpp killed 14 children, including his own son. He also murdered two pregnant women and had an incestuous relationship with his daughter. Stumpp claimed to have been granted the ability to turn into a werewolf by the Devil. As punishment for his crimes, Stumpp was put on a torture wheel and executed. His head was later severed and put on a pole next to the figure of a wolf to scare other people away from claiming themselves werewolves too. \nMembers of the Thuggee cult in India may have murdered a million people between 1740 and 1840. Thug Behram, a member of the cult, may have murdered as many as 931 victims. In his 1886 book, \"Psychopathia Sexualis\", psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing noted a case of a serial murderer in the 1870s, a Frenchman named Eusebius Pieydagnelle who had a sexual obsession with blood and confessed to murdering six people.\nThe unidentified killer Jack the Ripper, who has been called the first modern serial killer, killed at least five women, and possibly more, in London in 1888. He was the subject of a massive manhunt and investigation by the Metropolitan Police, during which many modern criminal investigation techniques were pioneered. A large team of policemen conducted house-to-house inquiries, forensic material was collected and suspects were identified and traced. Police surgeon Thomas Bond assembled one of the earliest character profiles of the offender.\nThe Ripper murders also marked an important watershed in the treatment of crime by journalists. While not the first serial killer in history, Jack the Ripper's case was the first to create a worldwide media frenzy. The dramatic murders of financially destitute women in the midst of the wealth of London focused the media's attention on the plight of the urban poor and gained coverage worldwide. Jack the Ripper has also been called the most infamous serial killer of all time, and his legend has spawned hundreds of theories on his real identity and many works of fiction.\nH. H. Holmes was a serial killer in the United States, responsible for the death of at least nine victims in the early 1890s. The case was one of the first involving a serial murderer that gained widespread notoriety and publicity through sensationalized accounts in William Randolph Hearst's newspapers. However, at the same time of the Holmes case, in France, Joseph Vacher became known as \"The French Ripper\" after killing and mutilating 11 women and children. He was executed in 1898 after confessing to his crimes.\nAnother notable non-American serial killer\u00a0is Pedro Lopez, a murderer from South America, who killed a minimum of 110 young girls between 1969 and 1980. However, he claims that the number is over 300. He was released from a mental facility in 1998 and his whereabouts are still unknown. He is commonly nicknamed the \"Monster of the Andes\". An additional non-American serial killer is Luis Garavito from Colombia. Garavito would kill and torture boys using various disguises. He murdered around 140 boys ranging in ages from 8 to 16. He would dump his victims' bodies in mass graves.\nLate 20th century.\nThe serial killing phenomenon in the United States was especially prominent from 1970 to 2000, which has been described as the \"golden age of serial murder\". The cause of the spike in serial killings has been attributed to urbanization, which put people in close proximity and offered anonymity. The number of active serial killers in the United States peaked in 1989 and has been steadily trending downward since, coinciding with an overall decrease in crime in the United States since that time. The decline in serial killers has no known single cause but is attributed to a number of factors. Mike Aamodt, emeritus professor at Radford University in Virginia, attributes the decline in number of serial killings to less frequent use of parole, improved forensic technology, and people behaving more cautiously. Causes for the general reduction in violent crime following the 1990s include increased incarceration in the United States, the end of the crack epidemic in the United States, and decreased lead exposure in early childhood.\nCharacteristics.\nSome commonly found characteristics of serial killers include the following:\nThere are exceptions to these criteria, however. For example, Harold Shipman was a successful professional (a General Practitioner working for the NHS). He was considered a pillar of the local community; he even won a professional award for a children's asthma clinic and was interviewed by Granada Television's \"World in Action\" on ITV. Dennis Nilsen was an ex-soldier turned civil servant and trade unionist who had no previous criminal record when arrested. Neither was known to have exhibited many of the tell-tale signs. Vlado Taneski, a crime reporter, was a career journalist who was caught after a series of articles he wrote gave clues that he had murdered people. Russell Williams was a successful and respected career Royal Canadian Air Force Colonel who was convicted of murdering two women, along with fetish burglaries and rapes.\nDevelopment.\nMany serial killers have faced similar problems in their childhood development. Hickey's Trauma Control Model explains how early childhood trauma can set the child up for deviant behavior in adulthood; the child's environment (either their parents or society) is the dominant factor determining whether or not the child's behavior escalates into homicidal activity.\nFamily, or lack thereof, is the most prominent part of a child's development because it is what the child can identify with on a regular basis. \"The serial killer is no different from any other individual who is instigated to seek approval from parents, sexual partners, or others.\" This need for approval is what influences children to attempt to develop social relationships with their family and peers. \"The quality of their attachments to parents and other members of the family is critical to how these children relate to and value other members of society.\"\nWilson and Seaman (1990) conducted a study on incarcerated serial killers, and what they concluded was the most influential factor that contributed to their homicidal activity. Almost all of the serial killers in the study had experienced some sort of environmental problems during their childhood, such as a broken home caused by divorce, or a lack of a parental figure to discipline the child. Nearly half of the serial killers had experienced some type of physical or sexual abuse, and more of them had experienced emotional neglect.\nWhen a parent has a drug or alcohol problem, the attention in the household is on the parents rather than the child. This neglect of the child leads to the lowering of their self-esteem and helps develop a fantasy world in which they are in control. Hickey's Trauma Control Model supports how parental neglect can facilitate deviant behavior, especially if the child sees substance abuse in action. This then leads to disposition (the inability to attach), which can further lead to homicidal behavior, unless the child finds a way to develop substantial relationships and fight the label they receive. If a child receives no support from anyone, then they are unlikely to recover from the traumatic event in a positive way. As stated by E. E. Maccoby, \"the family has continued to be seen as a major\u2014perhaps \"the\" major\u2014arena for socialization\".\nChromosomal makeup.\nThere have been studies looking into the possibility that an abnormality with one's chromosomes could be the trigger for serial killers. Two serial killers, Bobby Joe Long and Richard Speck, came to attention for reported chromosomal abnormalities. Long had an extra X chromosome. Speck was erroneously reported to have an extra Y chromosome; in fact, his karyotype was performed twice and was normal each time. While attempts have been made to link the XYY karyotype to violence, including serial murder, research has consistently found little or no association between violent criminal behaviour and an extra Y chromosome.\nFantasy.\nChildren who do not have the power to control the mistreatment they suffer sometimes create a new reality to which they can escape. This new reality becomes their fantasy that they have total control of and becomes part of their daily existence. In this fantasy world, their emotional development is guided and maintained. According to Garrison (1996), \"the child becomes sociopathic because the normal development of the concepts of right and wrong and empathy towards others is retarded because the child's emotional and social development occurs within his self-centered fantasies. A person can do no wrong in his own world and the pain of others is of no consequence when the purpose of the fantasy world is to satisfy the needs of one person\" (Garrison, 1996). Boundaries between fantasy and reality are lost and fantasies turn to dominance, control, sexual conquest, and violence, eventually leading to murder. Fantasy can lead to the first step in the process of a dissociative state, which, in the words of Stephen Giannangelo, \"allows the serial killer to leave the stream of consciousness for what is, to him, a better place\".\nCriminologist Jose Sanchez reports, \"The young criminal you see today is more detached from his victim, more ready to hurt or kill. The lack of empathy for their victims among young criminals is just one symptom of a problem that afflicts the whole society.\" Lorenzo Carcaterra, author of \"Gangster\" (2001), explains how potential criminals are labeled by society, which can then lead to their offspring also developing in the same way through the cycle of violence. The ability for serial killers to appreciate the mental life of others is severely compromised, presumably leading to their dehumanization of others. This process may be considered an expression of the intersubjectivity associated with a cognitive deficit regarding the capability to make sharp distinctions between other people and inanimate objects. For these individuals, objects can appear to possess animistic or humanistic power while people are perceived as objects. Before he was executed, serial killer Ted Bundy stated media violence and pornography had stimulated and increased his need to commit homicide, although this statement was made during last-ditch efforts to appeal his death sentence.\nOrganized, disorganized, and mixed.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, FBI profilers instigated a simple division of serial killers into \"organized\" and \"disorganized\"; that is, those who plan their crimes, and those who act on impulse. The FBI's \"Crime Classification Manual\" now places serial killers into three categories: \"organized\", \"disorganized\", and \"mixed\" (i.e., offenders who exhibit organized and disorganized characteristics). Some killers descend from organized to disorganized as their killings continue, as in the case of psychological decompensation or overconfidence due to having evaded capture.\nOrganized serial killers often plan their crimes methodically, usually abducting victims, killing them in one place and disposing of them in another. They often lure the victims with ploys appealing to their sense of sympathy. Others specifically target prostitutes, who are likely to go voluntarily with a stranger. These killers maintain a high degree of control over the crime scene and usually have a solid knowledge of forensic science that enables them to cover their tracks, such as burying the body or weighing it down and sinking it in a river. They follow their crimes in the news media carefully and often take pride in their actions as if it were all a grand project.\nOften, organized killers have social and other interpersonal skills sufficient to enable them to develop both personal and romantic relationships, friends and lovers and sometimes even attract and maintain a spouse and sustain a family including children. Among serial killers, those of this type are in the event of their capture most likely to be described by acquaintances as kind and unlikely to hurt anyone. Ted Bundy and John Wayne Gacy are examples of organized serial killers. In general, the IQs of organized serial killers tend to be normal range, with a mean of 98.7.\nDisorganized serial killers are usually far more impulsive, often committing their murders with a random weapon available at the time, and usually do not attempt to hide the body. They are likely to be unemployed, a loner, or both, with very few friends. They often turn out to have a history of mental illness, and their modus operandi (M.O.) or lack thereof is often marked by excessive violence and sometimes necrophilia or sexual violence. Disorganized serial killers have been found to have a lower mean IQ than organized serial killers, at 89.4. Mixed serial killers, with both organized and disorganized traits, have an average IQ of 100.9, but a low sample size.\nMedical professionals.\nSome people with a pathological interest in the power of life and death tend to be attracted to medical professions or acquiring such a job. These kinds of killers are sometimes referred to as \"angels of death\" or angels of mercy. Medical professionals will kill their patients for money, for a sense of sadistic pleasure, for a belief that they are \"easing\" the patient's pain, or simply \"because they can\". Perhaps the most prolific of these was the British doctor Harold Shipman. Another such killer was nurse Jane Toppan, who admitted during her murder trial that she was sexually aroused by death. She would administer a drug mixture to patients she chose as her victims, lie in bed with them and hold them close to her body as they died.\nAnother medical professional serial killer is Genene Jones. It is believed she killed 11 to 46 infants and children while working at Bexar County Medical Center Hospital in San Antonio, Texas, United States. She is currently serving a 99-year sentence for the murder of Chelsea McClellan and the attempted murder of Rolando Santos, and became eligible for parole in 2017 due to a law in Texas at the time of her sentencing to reduce prison overcrowding. A similar case occurred in Britain in 1991, where nurse Beverley Allitt killed four children at the hospital where she worked, attempted to kill three more, and injured a further six over the course of two months. A 21st-century example is Canadian nurse Elizabeth Wettlaufer, who murdered elderly patients in the nursing homes where she worked. William George Davis is another hospital nurse who was sentenced to death in Texas for the murder of four patients.\nFemale.\nFemale serial killers are rare compared to their male counterparts. Sources suggest that female serial killers represented less than one in every six known serial murderers in the United States between 1800 and 2004 (64 females from a total of 416 known offenders), or that around 15% of U.S. serial killers have been women, with a collective number of victims between 427 and 612. The authors of \"Lethal Ladies\", Amanda L. Farrell, Robert D. Keppel, and Victoria B. Titterington, state that \"the Justice Department indicated 36 female serial killers have been active over the course of the last century.\" According to \"The Journal of Forensic Psychiatry &amp; Psychology\", there is evidence that 16% of all serial killers are women.\nMichael D. Kelleher and C. L. Kelleher created several categories to describe female serial killers. They used the classifications of \"black widow\", \"angel of death\", \"sexual predator\", \"revenge\", \"profit or crime\", \"team killer\", \"question of sanity\", \"unexplained\", and \"unsolved\". In using these categories, they observed that most women fell into the categories of the black widow or team killer. Although motivations for female serial killers can include attention seeking, addiction, or the result of psychopathological behavioral factors, female serial killers are commonly categorized as murdering men for material gain, usually being emotionally close to their victims, and generally needing to have a relationship with the victim, hence the traditional cultural image of the \"black widow\".\nThe methods that female serial killers use for murder are frequently covert or low-profile, such as murder by poison (the preferred choice for killing). Other methods used by female serial killers include shootings (used by 20%), suffocation (16%), stabbing (11%), and drowning (5%). They commit killings in specific places, such as their home or a health-care facility, or at different locations within the same city or state. A notable exception to the typical characteristics of female serial killers is Aileen Wuornos, who killed outdoors instead of at home, used a gun instead of poison, and killed strangers instead of friends or family. One \"analysis of 86 female serial killers from the United States found that the victims tended to be spouses, children or the elderly\". Other studies indicate that since 1975, increasingly strangers are marginally the most preferred victim of female serial killers, or that only 26% of female serial killers kill for material gain only. Sources state that each killer will have her own proclivities, needs and triggers. A review of the published literature on female serial murder stated that \"sexual or sadistic motives are believed to be extremely rare in female serial murderers, and psychopathic traits and histories of childhood abuse have been consistently reported in these women.\"\nA study by Eric W. Hickey (2010) of 64 female serial killers in the United States indicated that sexual activity was one of several motives in 10% of the cases, enjoyment in 11% and control in 14% and that 51% of all U.S. female serial killers murdered at least one woman and 31% murdered at least one child. In other cases, women have been involved as an accomplice with a male serial killer as a part of a serial killing team. A 2015 study published in \"The Journal of Forensic Psychiatry &amp; Psychology\" found that the most common motive for female serial killers was for financial gain and almost 40% of them had experienced some sort of mental illness.\nPeter Vronsky in \"Female Serial Killers\" (2007) maintains that female serial killers today often kill for the same reason males do: as a means of expressing rage and control. He suggests that sometimes the theft of the victims' property by the female \"black widow\" type serial killer appears to be for material gain, but really is akin to a male serial killer's collecting of totems (souvenirs) from the victim as a way of exerting continued control over the victim and reliving it. By contrast, Hickey states that although popular perception sees \"black widow\" female serial killers as something of the Victorian past, in his statistical study of female serial killer cases reported in the United States since 1826, approximately 75% occurred since 1950.\nElizabeth B\u00e1thory is sometimes cited as the most prolific female serial killer in all of history. Formally countess Elizabeth B\u00e1thory de Ecsed (B\u00e1thory Erzs\u00e9bet in Hungarian, August 7, 1560 \u2013 August 21, 1614), she was a countess from the B\u00e1thory family. Before her husband's death, Elizabeth took great pleasure in torturing the staff, by jamming pins under the servant's fingernails or stripping servants and throwing them into the snow. After her husband's death, she and four collaborators were accused of torturing and killing hundreds of girls and young women, with one witness attributing to them over 600 victims, though the number for which they were convicted was 80. Elizabeth herself was neither tried nor convicted. In 1610, however, she was imprisoned in the Csejte Castle, where she remained bricked in a set of rooms until her death four years later.\nA 2010 article by Perri and Lichtenwald addressed some of the misconceptions concerning female criminality. In the article, Perri and Lichtenwald analyze the current research regarding female psychopathy, including case studies of female psychopathic killers featuring Munchausen syndrome by proxy, cesarean section homicide, fraud detection homicide, female kill teams, and a female serial killer.\nJuvenile.\nJuvenile serial killers are rare. There are three main categories that juvenile serial killers can fit into: primary, maturing, and secondary killers. There have been studies done to compare and contrast these three groups and to discover similarities and differences between them. Although these types of serial killers are less common, oftentimes adult serial killers may make their debut at an early age and it can be an opportunity for researchers to study what factors brought about the behavior. While juvenile serial killers are rare, the youngest felon on death row is a juvenile serial killer named Harvey Miguel Robinson who was 17 at the time of his crimes and 18 at the time of his arrest.\nEthnicity and demographics in the United States.\nThere is a myth that all serial killers are white males. However, according to the FBI, the racial composition of serial killers as a group reflects the racial composition of the overall U.S. population. White males are actually greatly under-represented among serial killers in proportion to their overall numbers in the United States. According to a 2016 study, since the year 2000, African Americans accounted for roughly 60% of all serial killers in the United States.\nAnthony Walsh has said that non-white serial killers are often ignored by the mainstream media. According to his analysis, Black males were over-represented among serial killers by a factor of 2, yet media coverage at that time overwhelmingly focused on white male serial killers. Walsh argues that the popular media ignores black serial killers because there is a fear of allegations of racism. This may enable black serial killers to operate more effectively, as their crimes do not get the same media attention as the crimes of non-black serial killers.\nMotives.\nThe motives of serial killers are generally placed into four categories: \"visionary\", \"mission-oriented\", \"hedonistic\", and \"power or control\"; however, the motives of any given killer may display considerable overlap among these categories.\nVisionary.\nVisionary serial killers suffer from psychotic breaks with reality, sometimes believing they are another person or are compelled to murder by entities such as the Devil or God. The two most common subgroups are \"demon mandated\" and \"God mandated\".\nHerbert Mullin believed the American casualties in the Vietnam War were preventing California from experiencing the Big One. As the war wound down, Mullin claimed his father instructed him via telepathy to raise the number of \"human sacrifices to nature\" to delay a catastrophic earthquake that would plunge California into the ocean. David Berkowitz (\"Son of Sam\") may also be an example of a visionary serial killer, having claimed a demon transmitted orders through his neighbor's dog and instructed him to commit murder. Berkowitz later described those claims as a hoax, as originally concluded by psychiatrist David Abrahamsen.\nMission-oriented.\nMission-oriented killers typically justify their acts as \"ridding the world\" of certain types of people perceived as undesirable, such as the homeless, ex-cons, homosexuals, drug users, prostitutes, or people of different ethnicity or religion; however, they are generally not psychotic. Some see themselves as attempting to change society, often to cure a societal ill.\nAn example of a mission-oriented killer would be Joseph Paul Franklin, an American white supremacist who exclusively targeted Jewish, biracial, and African American individuals for the purpose of inciting a \"race war\". Saeed Hanaei was a serial killer convicted of murdering at least sixteen women in his native Iran, many of whom were sex workers. He reported his goal was to cleanse his city of \"moral corruption\" and that his mission was sanctioned by God.\nHedonistic.\nThis type of serial killer seeks thrills and derives pleasure and satisfaction from killing, seeing people as expendable means to this goal. Forensic psychologists have identified three subtypes of the hedonistic killer: \"lust\", \"thrill\", and \"comfort\".\nLust.\nSex is the primary motive of lust killers, whether or not the victims are dead, and fantasy plays a large role in their killings. Their sexual gratification depends on the amount of torture and mutilation they perform on their victims. The sexual serial murderer has a psychological need to have absolute control, dominance, and power over their victims, and the infliction of torture, pain, and ultimately death is used in an attempt to fulfill their need. They usually use weapons that require close contact with the victims, such as knives or hands. As lust killers continue with their murders, the time between killings decreases or the required level of stimulation increases, sometimes both.\nKenneth Bianchi, one of the \"Hillside Stranglers\", murdered women and girls of different ages, races, and appearance because his sexual urges required different types of stimulation and increasing intensity. Jeffrey Dahmer searched for his perfect fantasy lover\u2014beautiful, submissive and eternal. As his desire increased, he experimented with drugs, alcohol, and exotic sex. His increasing need for stimulation was demonstrated by the dismemberment of victims, whose heads and genitals he preserved, and by his attempts to create a \"living zombie\" under his control (by pouring acid into a hole drilled into the victim's skull).\nDahmer once said, \"Lust played a big part of it. Control and lust. Once it happened the first time, it just seemed like it had control of my life from there on in. The killing was just a means to an end. That was the least satisfactory part. I didn't enjoy doing that. That's why I tried to create living zombies with acid and the drill.\" He further elaborated on this, also saying, \"I wanted to see if it was possible to make\u2014again, it sounds really gross\u2014uh, zombies, people that would not have a will of their own, but would follow my instructions without resistance. So after that, I started using the drilling technique.\" He experimented with cannibalism to \"ensure his victims would always be a part of him\".\nThrill.\nThe primary motive of a thrill killer is to induce pain or terror in their victims, which provides stimulation and excitement for the killer. They seek the adrenaline rush provided by hunting and killing victims. Thrill killers murder only for the kill; usually, the attack is not prolonged, and there is no sexual aspect. Usually, the victims are strangers, although the killer may have followed them for a period of time. Thrill killers can abstain from killing for long periods of time and become more successful at killing as they refine their murder methods. Many attempt to commit the perfect crime and believe they will not be caught.\nRobert Hansen took his victims to a secluded area, where he would let them loose and then hunt and kill them. In one of his letters to San Francisco Bay Area newspapers in San Francisco, California, the Zodiac Killer wrote \"[killing] gives me the most thrilling experience it is even better than getting your rocks off with a girl\". Carl Watts was described by a surviving victim as \"excited and hyper and clappin' and just making noises like he was excited, that this was gonna be fun\" during the 1982 attack. Slashing, stabbing, hanging, drowning, asphyxiating, and strangling were among the ways Watts killed.\nComfort (profit).\nMaterial gain and a comfortable lifestyle are the primary motives of comfort killers. Usually, the victims are family members and close acquaintances. After a murder, a comfort killer will usually wait for a period of time before killing again to allow any suspicions by family or authorities to subside. They often use poison, most notably arsenic, to kill their victims. Female serial killers are often comfort killers, although not all comfort killers are female.\nDorothea Puente killed her tenants for their Social Security checks and buried them in the backyard of her home. H. H. Holmes killed for insurance and business profits. Puente and Holmes had previous records of crimes such as theft, fraud, non-payment of debts, embezzlement and others of a similar nature. Dorothea Puente was finally arrested on a parole violation, having been on parole for a previous fraud conviction. Contract killers (\"hitmen\") may exhibit similar characteristics of serial killers, but are generally not classified as such because of third-party killing objectives and detached financial and emotional incentives. Nevertheless, there are occasionally individuals that are labeled as both a hitman and a serial killer.\nPower/control.\nThe main objective for this type of serial killer is to gain and exert power over their victim. Such killers are sometimes abused as children, leaving them with feelings of powerlessness and inadequacy as adults. Many power- or control-motivated killers sexually abuse their victims, but they differ from hedonistic killers in that rape is not motivated by lust (as it would be with a lust murder) but as simply another form of dominating the victim. Ted Bundy is an example of a power/control-oriented serial killer. He traveled around the United States seeking women to control.\nMedia influences.\nMany serial killers claim that a violent culture influenced them to commit murders. During his final interview, Ted Bundy stated that hardcore pornography was responsible for his actions. Others idolise figures for their deeds or perceived vigilante justice, such as Peter K\u00fcrten, who idolized Jack the Ripper, or John Wayne Gacy and Ed Kemper, who both idolized the actor John Wayne.\nKillers who have a strong desire for fame or to be renowned for their actions desire media attention as a way of validating and spreading their crimes; fear is also a component here, as some serial killers enjoy causing fear. An example is Dennis Rader, who sought attention from the press during his murder spree.\nTheories.\nBiological and sociological.\nTheories for why certain people commit serial murder have been advanced. Some theorists believe the reasons are biological, suggesting serial killers are born, not made, and that their violent behavior is a result of abnormal brain activity. Holmes believes that \"until a reliable sample can be obtained and tested, there is no scientific statement that can be made concerning the exact role of biology as a determining factor of a serial killer personality.\"\nThe \"Fractured Identity Syndrome\" (FIS) is a merging of Charles Cooley's \"looking glass self\" and Erving Goffman's \"virtual\" and \"actual social identity\" theories. The FIS suggests a social event, or series of events, during one's childhood results in a fracturing of the personality of the serial killer. The term \"fracture\" is defined as a small breakage of the personality which is often not visible to the outside world and is only felt by the killer.\n\"Social Process Theory\" has also been suggested as an explanation for serial murder. Social process theory states that offenders may turn to crime due to peer pressure, family and friends. Criminal behavior is a process of interaction with social institutions, in which everyone has the potential for criminal behavior. A lack of family structure and identity could also be a cause leading to serial murder traits. A child used as a scapegoat will be deprived of their capacity to feel guilt. Displaced anger could result in animal torture, as identified in the Macdonald triad, and a further lack of basic identity.\nMilitary.\nThe \"military theory\" has been proposed as an explanation for why serial murderers kill, as some serial murderers have served in the military or related fields. According to Castle and Hensley, 7% of the serial killers studied had military experience. This figure may be a proportional under-representation when compared to the number of military veterans in a nation's total population. For example, according to the United States census for the year 2000, military veterans comprised 12.7% of the U.S. population; in England, it was estimated in 2007 that military veterans comprised 9.1% of the population. Though by contrast, about 2.5% of the population of Canada in 2006 consisted of military veterans.\nThere are two theories that can be used to study the correlation between serial killing and military training: \"Applied learning theory\" states that serial killing can be learned. The military is training for higher kill rates from servicemen while training the soldiers to be desensitized to taking a human life. \"Social learning theory\" can be used when soldiers get praised and accommodated for killing. They learn or believe that they learn, that it is acceptable to kill because they were praised for it in the military. Serial killers want accreditation for the work that they have done.\nIn both military and serial killing, the offender or the soldier may become desensitized to killing as well as compartmentalized; the soldiers do not see enemy personnel as \"human\" and neither do serial killers see their victims as humans. The theories do not imply that military institutions make a deliberate effort to produce serial killers; to the contrary, all military personnel are trained to recognize when, where, and against whom it is appropriate to use deadly force, which starts with the basic \"Law of Land Warfare\", taught during the initial training phase, and may include more stringent policies for military personnel in law enforcement or security.\nInvestigation.\nFBI: Issues and practices.\nIn 2008, the FBI published a handbook titled \"Serial Murder\" which was the product of a symposium held in 2005 to bring together the many issues surrounding serial murder, including its investigation.\nIdentification.\nAccording to the FBI, identifying one, or multiple, murders as being the work of a serial killer is the first challenge an investigation faces, especially if the victim(s) come from a marginalized or high-risk population and is normally linked through forensic or behavioral evidence. Should the cases cross multiple jurisdictions, the law enforcement system in the United States is fragmented and thus not configured to detect multiple similar murders across a large geographic area. Ted Bundy was particularly famous for such geographic exploitations. He used his knowledge about the lack of communication between multiple jurisdictions to avoid arrest and detection. The FBI suggests utilizing databases and increasing interdepartmental communication. Keppel suggests holding multi-jurisdictional conferences regularly to compare cases giving departments a greater chance to detect linked cases and overcome linkage blindness.\nOne collaboration, the Serial Homicide Expertise and Information Sharing Collaborative, was formed in 2010 and made serial murder data widely accessible after multiple experts combined their databases to aid in research and investigation. Another collaboration, the \"Radford/FGCU Serial Killer Database Project\" was proposed at the 2012 FDIAI Annual Conference. Utilizing Radford's Serial Killer Database as a starting point, the new collaboration, hosted by FGCU Justice Studies, has invited and is working in conjunction with other universities to maintain and expand the scope of the database to also include spree and mass murders. Utilizing over 170 data points, multiple-murderer methodology and victimology; researchers and Law Enforcement Agencies can build case studies and statistical profiles to further research the \"Who, What, Why and How\" of these types of crimes.\nLeadership.\nLeadership, or administration, should play a small or virtually non-existent role in the actual investigation past assigning knowledgeable or experienced homicide investigators to lead positions. The administration's role is not to run the investigation but to establish and reaffirm the primary goal of catching the serial killer, as well as provide support for the investigators. The FBI (2008) suggests completing Memorandums of Understanding to facilitate support and commitment of resources from different jurisdictions to an investigation. Egger takes this one step further and suggests completing mutual aid pacts, which are written agreements to provide support to each other in a time of need, with surrounding jurisdictions. Doing this in advance would save time and resources that could be used on the investigation.\nOrganization.\nThe structural organization of an investigation is key to its success, as demonstrated by the investigation of Gary Ridgway, the Green River Killer. Once a serial murder case was established, a task force was created to track down and arrest the offender. Over the course of the investigation, for various reasons, the task force's organization was radically changed and reorganized multiple times \u2013 at one point including more than 50 full-time personnel, and at another, only a single investigator. Eventually, what led to the end of the investigation was a conference of 25 detectives organized to share ideas to solve the case.\nThe FBI handbook provides a description of how a task force should be organized but offers no additional options on how to structure the investigation. While it appears advantageous to have a full-time staff assigned to a serial murder investigation, it can become prohibitively expensive. For example, the Green River Task Force cost upwards of $2\u00a0million per year, and as was witnessed with the Green River Killer investigation, other strategies can prevail where a task force fails. A common strategy, already employed by many departments for other reasons, is the conference, in which departments get together and focus on a specific set of topics. With serial murders, the focus is typically on unsolved cases, with evidence thought to be related to the case at hand.\nSimilar to a conference is an information clearing-house in which a jurisdiction with a suspected serial murder case collects all of its evidence and actively seeks data that may be related from other jurisdictions. By collecting all of the related information into one place, they provide a central point in which it can be organized and easily accessed by other jurisdictions working toward the goal of arresting an offender and ending the murders. A task force provides for a flexible, organized, framework for jurisdictions depending on the needs of the investigation. Unfortunately due to the need to commit resources (manpower, money, equipment, etc.) for long periods of time it can be an unsustainable option.\nIn the case of the investigation of Aileen Wournos, the Marion County Sheriff coordinated multiple agencies without any written or formal agreement. While not a specific strategy for a serial murder investigation, this is certainly a best practice in so far as the agencies were able to work easily together toward a common goal. Finally, once a serial murder investigation has been identified, the use of an FBI Rapid Response Team can assist both experienced and inexperienced jurisdictions in setting up a task force. This is completed by organizing and delegating jobs, by compiling and analyzing clues, and by establishing communication between the parties involved.\nResource augmentation.\nDuring the course of a serial murder investigation, it may become necessary to call in additional resources; the FBI defines this as Resource Augmentation. Within the structure of a task force, the addition of a resource should be thought of as either long-term or short-term. If the task force's framework is expanded to include the new resource, then it should be permanent and not removed. For short-term needs, such as setting up roadblocks or canvassing a neighborhood, additional resources should be called in on a short-term basis. The decision of whether resources are needed short or long term should be left to the lead investigator and facilitated by the administration.\nThe confusion and counter productiveness created by changing the structure of a task force mid investigation is illustrated by the way the Green River Task Force's staffing and structure was changed multiple times throughout the investigation. This made an already complicated situation more difficult, resulting in the delay or loss of information, which allowed Ridgway to continue killing. The FBI model does not take into account that permanently expanding a task force, or investigative structure, may not be possible due to cost or personnel availability. Egger (1998) offers several alternative strategies including; using investigative consultants, or experienced staff to augment an investigative team. Not all departments have investigators experienced in serial murder and by temporarily bringing in consultants, they can educate a department to a level of competence then step out. This would reduce the initially established framework of the investigation team and save the department the cost of retaining the consultants until the conclusion of the investigation.\nCommunication.\nThe FBI handbook (2008) and Keppel (1989) both stress communication as paramount. The difference is that the FBI handbook concentrates primarily on communication within a task force, while Keppel makes getting information out to and allowing information to be passed back from patrol officers a priority. The FBI handbook suggests having daily e-mail or in-person briefings for all staff involved in the investigation and providing periodic summary briefings to patrol officers and managers. Looking back on a majority of serial murderer arrests, most are exercised by patrol officers in the course of their everyday duties and unrelated to the ongoing serial murder investigation.\nKeppel provides examples of Larry Eyler, who was arrested during a traffic stop for a parking violation, and Ted Bundy, who was arrested during a traffic stop for operating a stolen vehicle. In each case, it was uniformed officers, not directly involved in the investigation, who knew what to look for and took the direct action that stopped the killer. By providing up-to-date (as opposed to periodic) briefings and information to officers on the street the chances of catching a serial killer, or finding solid leads, are increased.\nData management.\nA serial murder investigation generates staggering amounts of data, all of which needs to be reviewed and analyzed. A standardized method of documenting and distributing information must be established and investigators must be allowed time to complete reports while investigating leads and at the end of a shift (FBI 2008). When the mechanism for data management is insufficient, leads are not only lost or buried but the investigation can be hindered and new information can become difficult to obtain or become corrupted.\nDuring the Green River Killer investigation, reporters would often find and interview possible victims or witnesses ahead of investigators. The understaffed investigation was unable to keep up the information flow, which prevented them from promptly responding to leads. To make matters worse, investigators believed that the journalists, untrained in interviewing victims or witnesses of crimes, would corrupt the information and result in unreliable leads.\nMemorabilia.\nNotorious and infamous serial killers number in the thousands and a subculture revolves around their legacies. That subculture includes the collection, sale, and display of serial killer memorabilia, dubbed \"murderabilia\" by Andrew Kahan, one of the best-known opponents of collectors of serial killer remnants. Kahan is the director of the Mayor's Crime Victims Office in Houston. He is backed by the families of murder victims and \"Son of Sam laws\" existing in some states that prevent murderers from profiting from the publicity generated by their crimes.\nSuch memorabilia includes the paintings, writings, and poems of these killers. Recently, marketing has capitalized even more upon interest in serial killers with the rise of various merchandise such as trading cards, action figures, and books. Some serial killers attain celebrity status in the way they acquire fans and may have previous personal possessions auctioned off on websites like eBay. A few examples of this are Ed Gein's 150-pound stolen gravestone and Bobby Joe Long's sunglasses.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "42627", "revid": "26386571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42627", "title": "1968 Democratic National Convention", "text": "Selection of the Democratic nominee for the 1968 U.S. presidential election in Chicago\nThe 1968 Democratic National Convention was held August 26\u201329 at the International Amphitheatre in Chicago, Illinois, United States. Earlier that year incumbent President Lyndon B. Johnson had announced he would not seek reelection, thus making the purpose of the convention to select a new presidential nominee for the Democratic Party. Vice President Hubert Humphrey and Senator Edmund Muskie of Maine were nominated for president and vice president, respectively.\nThe event was among the most tense and confrontational political conventions in American history, and became notorious for the televised heavy-handed police tactics of the host, Mayor Richard J. Daley of Chicago. The most contentious issues were the continuing American military involvement in the Vietnam War, and expanding the right to vote to draft-age soldiers by lowering the voting age from 21 to 18 years old. Dissatisfaction with the convention led to significant changes in the rules governing delegate selection, ushering in the modern primary election system.\nThe year 1968 was a time of riots, political turbulence, and mass civil unrest. The assassination of Martin Luther King in April of that year, following his opposition to the Vietnam War, further inflamed racial tensions, and protest riots in more than 100 cities followed. The convention also followed the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, a candidate in the primary, on June 5. Currently second in delegates at the time of his death to the pro-war Humphrey, the loss of Kennedy saw his committed delegates go for Humphrey over candidate Eugene McCarthy, who had been third in delegates.\nThe Humphrey\u2013Muskie ticket failed to win the confidence of Democratic voters, to unite liberals, or to attract anti-war voters. They were later defeated in the presidential election by the \"silent majority\" Republican ticket of Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew.\nBefore the convention.\nThe Democratic Party, which controlled the House, the Senate, and the White House in 1968, was divided. Senator Eugene McCarthy entered the campaign in November 1967, challenging incumbent President Lyndon Johnson for the Democratic nomination. Senator Robert F. Kennedy entered the race in March 1968.\nJohnson, facing dissent within his party, never entered the 1968 race but won the New Hampshire presidential primary in March 1968 as a write-in candidate; he then announced on March 31 that he would not seek re-election. The Wisconsin primary was scheduled for April 2, and public opinion polls showed Johnson as third in the race, behind McCarthy and Kennedy. In his television address announcing his withdrawal from the presidential race, Johnson also announced the United States would stop bombing North Vietnam north of the 19th parallel and was willing to open peace talks. On April 27 Vice President Hubert Humphrey entered the race but did not compete in any primaries; instead he inherited the delegates previously pledged to Johnson and then collected delegates in caucus states, especially in caucuses controlled by local Democratic bosses.\nVietnam War peace talks had begun in Paris on May 13, 1968, but almost immediately became deadlocked as Xuan Thuy, the head of the North Vietnamese delegation, demanded that the U.S. give a promise to unconditionally stop bombing North Vietnam, a demand rejected by W. Averell Harriman of the American delegation. From the start of the bombing under Operation Rolling Thunder in 1965, the North Vietnamese had demanded the U.S. unconditionally halt the bombing as the first step towards peace. It soon became apparent that no progress would be possible in Paris until the U.S. promised to unconditionally cease bombing, as the talks floundered on that issue through the spring, summer and fall of 1968.\nAfter Robert Kennedy's assassination on June 5, the Democratic Party's divisions grew. At the moment of Kennedy's death the delegate count stood at Humphrey 561.5, Kennedy 393.5, McCarthy 258. Kennedy's murder left his delegates uncommitted. Support within the Democratic Party was divided between McCarthy, who ran a decidedly anti-war campaign and was seen as the peace candidate; Humphrey, who was seen as the candidate representing the more hawkish Johnson point of view; and Senator George McGovern, who appealed to some of Kennedy's supporters.\nWhen Vice President Humphrey arrived in Chicago, Daley was not at the airport to greet him, instead sending a police bagpipe band to welcome him. As Humphrey was driven to the Conrad Hilton hotel, he noticed that no one in the streets cheered him, in marked contrast to the arrival of McCarthy, who had been greeted by 5,000 cheering supporters.\nConvention.\nThe convention was among the most tense and confrontational political conventions ever in American history, marked by fierce debate and protest over the Vietnam peace talks and controversy over the heavy-handed police tactics of the convention's host, Mayor Richard J. Daley of Chicago. The keynote speaker was Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii.\nBefore the start of the convention on August 26, several states had competing slates of delegates attempting to be seated at the convention. Some of these delegate credential fights went to the floor of the convention on August 26, where votes were held to determine which slates of delegates representing Texas, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and North Carolina would be seated at the convention. The more racially integrated challenging slate from Texas was defeated.\nVietnam war plank and Johnson's influence.\nWithin the convention, tensions arose between pro-war and anti-war Democrats. One of the principal issues at the peace talks in Paris was the North Vietnamese demand that the U.S. unconditionally cease bombing North Vietnam before discussing any other matters. The more dovish Democrats favored the North Vietnamese demand while more hawkish Democrats demanded the North Vietnamese promise to close the Ho Chi Minh Trail as the price of a bombing pause, a demand the North Vietnamese rejected. Vice President Humphrey, confronted with a divided party, attempted to craft a party platform that would appeal to both factions, calling for a bombing pause that \"took into account, most importantly, the risk to American troops as well as the response from Hanoi.\" Humphrey's platform tacitly implied that he would order a complete bombing pause if elected. Anticipating the \"Vietnamization\" strategy later carried out by Richard Nixon, Humphrey's platform called for the \"de-Americanization\" of the war as the U.S. gradually pulled American troops out from South Vietnam and shifted the burden of fighting back to the South Vietnamese.\nJohnson, despite spending the week at his Texas ranch, maintained tight control over the proceedings, going so far as to have the Federal Bureau of Investigation illegally tap Humphrey's telephones to find out his plans. Humphrey previewed his platform to two of Johnson's more hawkish advisers, Secretary of State Dean Rusk and National Security Advisor Walt Whitman Rostow. Rostow very reluctantly gave his approval while Rusk told Humphrey, \"We can live with this, Hubert.\" Johnson angrily rejected Humphrey's compromise peace plank as a personal affront, telling Humphrey in a telephone call to change it at once. When Humphrey protested that \"Dean Rusk approved it,\" Johnson shouted over the phone: \"That's not the way I hear it. Well, this just undercuts our whole policy, and by God, the Democratic Party ought not to be doing that to me, and you ought not to be doing it. You've been a part of the policy.\" To put further pressure on Humphrey, Johnson called up General Creighton Abrams, the commander of the U.S. forces in Vietnam, to ask if a complete bombing pause would endanger the lives of American soldiers; Abrams, unaware of the intra-Democratic dispute, wrote back that it would. Johnson gave a copy to Hale Boggs, chairman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), who in turn showed it to various leading delegates to show how reckless and \"unpatriotic\" Humphrey was in contemplating a bombing pause. Faced with Johnson's fury, Humphrey gave in and accepted a plank more to Johnson's liking. Johnson always felt contempt for Humphrey and liked to bully him, telling Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford that he would respect Humphrey more if only he \"showed he had some balls\". Though some of Humphrey's advisors counseled him to defy the lame-duck president, Humphrey resignedly stated: \"Well, it would not look like an act based on principle or conviction; it would seem like a gimmick. It would seem strange. And it would enrage the president.\"\nThe platform that Humphrey had written on Johnson's dictation was intended to be introduced onto the floor of the convention at the end of Day 2 \u2014 well after midnight \u2014 before Donald Peterson, the manager of Senator McCarthy\u2019s campaign in Wisconsin and the head of the Wisconsin delegation, motioned to adjourn the convention and platform fight until the next day. A supporter of the minority plank, he stated his desire for the viewing public to see the debate and for the plank to be debated with full energy. Convention chairman Carl Albert claimed the motion to adjourn was not a recognized motion and declared Peterson out of order. The exhausted delegates on the floor rallied behind the adjournment motion and began chanting \u201clet\u2019s go home!\u201d, leading to Mayor Daley taking to a microphone and calling for the removal of people in the rafters whom he mistakenly believed to be responsible for the uproar. When this failed to quell the enthusiasm, Daley took to the mic again, now to second the adjournment motion; Daley was not declared out of order, and the mayor\u2019s motion was recognized by chairman Albert.\nWhen the plank was finally introduced, it prompted a passionate three-hour long floor debate as anti-war Democrats obstinately objected. The platform was passed with 1,567 delegates (60%) voting for the platform and 1,041 (40%) voting against. When the platform was passed, the delegation from New York put on black armbands and began to sing \"We Shall Overcome\" in protest. Humphrey later stated that his biggest mistake of the election was to give in to Johnson, contending that if he stuck to his original platform it would have shown his independence and given him a lead in the polls. Humphrey always believed that if he had given his planned speech (which he instead gave in Salt Lake City on September 30, 1968) calling for an unconditional bombing pause of North Vietnam as \"an acceptable risk for peace\", that he would have won the election.\nHumphrey also complained that the convention had been held in late August to coincide with Johnson's birthday, which cost him a month to organize, preferring to have the convention held in July. Complicating the election was the third party candidacy of Alabama governor George Wallace, who ran on a white supremacist platform promising to undo the changes of the Civil Rights Movement. Conservative whites in the South had long voted as a bloc for the Democrats, but in the 1960s many were starting to move away from the Democratic Party. Nixon had embarked on his Southern strategy of wooing conservative Southern whites over to the Republicans, but Wallace, more extreme on racial questions than was possible for Nixon, threatened to preempt the Southern strategy. Johnson had wanted Humphrey to nominate as his running mate a conservative white Southern Democrat who might prevent Southern whites from voting for Wallace or Nixon, bringing back one of the most loyal Democratic voting blocs of the past century. Humphrey mustered the courage to defy Johnson and choose as his running mate Senator Edmund Muskie of Maine, a dignified, centrist Democrat.\nHumphrey had been well known as a liberal supporter of the Civil Rights Movement, and he felt that with Nixon and Wallace competing for the conservative white Southern voters there was no realistic opportunity for him to appeal to that group. In 1948, Humphrey, at that time the mayor of Minneapolis, had first come to national attention when he delivered a speech at the 1948 Democratic National Convention denouncing racial injustices in the South. However, over the protests of liberals, Humphrey did not resist Johnson's decision to seat several all-white delegations from several Southern states despite the complaints that Black Americans (and in the case of the Texas delegation, Mexican-Americans) had been systematically excluded.\nThough Johnson had publicly dropped out of the presidential election, he entertained thoughts of re-entering it. He sent his friend and colleague, Texas Governor John Connally, to meet with other southern Democratic governors attending the convention to inquire if they would be willing to support nominating Johnson. Mayor Daley, a strong Johnson supporter, was enthusiastic about having Johnson re-enter. Daley, who was apparently oblivious of the deep antagonism between Johnson and the Kennedy family, favored Senator Ted Kennedy for Johnson's running mate, saying that an \"LBJ-TEK\" ticket would win easily. Daley was so committed to having Johnson re-enter the race that he had secretly printed up signs reading \"We Love LBJ\". He also called up Kennedy to discuss his plans, but Kennedy, who was suffering from depression after the recent assassination of his brother Robert, was not interested. It remains unclear if Johnson was serious about re-entering, or if he was merely using the prospect as a threat to control Humphrey. In the end, Connally's polling found the general feeling about the plan to be \"No way!\"\nNomination results.\nIn the end, the Democratic Party nominated Humphrey. The delegates had defeated the peace plank by &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1,567+3\u20444 to &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1,041+1\u20444. The loss was perceived to be the result of Johnson and Daley influencing behind the scenes. Humphrey, who had not entered any of the thirteen state primary elections, won the Democratic nomination shortly after midnight, and many delegates shouted, \"No! No!\" when his victory was announced. The nomination was watched by 89 million Americans. As a sign of racial reconciliation, Humphrey had intended for his nomination to be seconded by a speech by Carl Stokes, the Black mayor of Cleveland, Ohio. Stokes's speech was not shown on live national television as planned, as the networks instead broadcast live the \"Battle of Michigan Avenue\" that was taking place in front of the Conrad Hilton Hotel. Humphrey announced Senator Edmund Muskie of Maine as his running mate the following morning, whose selection was welcomed by those attending his announcement and ratified by the convention that evening with 1942.5 delegate votes on the first ballot. Humphrey went on to lose the 1968 presidential election to the Republican Richard Nixon.\nRichard J. Daley and the convention.\nThe convention's host, Mayor Richard J. Daley of Chicago, intended to showcase his and the city's achievements to national Democrats and the news media. Instead, the proceedings became notorious for the large number of demonstrators and the use of force by the Chicago police during what was supposed to be, in the words of Yippie activist organizers, \"A Festival of Life.\" Crowd control against the demonstrators by the Chicago Police Department and the Illinois National Guard devolved into a police riot. The disturbances were well publicized by the mass media, with some journalists and reporters being caught up in the violence. Network newsmen Dan Rather, Mike Wallace, and Edwin Newman were assaulted by the police while inside the convention hall.\nPreparation.\nThe Democratic National Convention had been held in Chicago twelve years earlier. Daley had played an integral role in the election of John F. Kennedy in 1960. In 1968, however, it did not seem that Daley had maintained the clout which would allow him to bring out the voters again to produce a Democratic victory as he had in 1960.\nPresident Johnson had wanted the Democratic convention to be held in Houston, but Daley had successfully lobbied the president to hold it in Chicago to showcase to the national media Daley's successes in his fifteen years as mayor. On October 7, 1967, Daley and Johnson had a private meeting at a fund raiser for Johnson's re-election campaign, with an entry fee of one thousand dollars per plate (approximately $9,200 in 2025 dollars). During the meeting, Daley explained to the president that there had been a disappointing showing of Democrats in the 1966 congressional races, and the president might lose the swing state of Illinois with its 26 electoral votes if the convention were not held there. Johnson's pro-war policies had already created a great division within the party; he hoped that the selection of Chicago for the convention would eliminate further conflict with opposition. The DNC head for selecting the location was David Wilentz of New Jersey, who gave the official reason for choosing Chicago as, \"It is centrally located geographically which will reduce transportation costs and because it has been the site of national conventions for both Parties in the past and is therefore attuned to holding them.\" The conversation between Johnson and Daley was leaked to the press and published in the \"Chicago Tribune\" and several other papers.\nDaley ruled Chicago with a tight grip, and was determined to stop the protests which threatened to ruin his moment of triumph. In preparation, Daley had walls erected along the roads to the Amphitheatre through his own neighborhood of Bridgeport to obscure from sight rundown housing in the neighborhood.\nDaley's fear of the protestors.\nTen thousand demonstrators gathered in Chicago for the convention, where they were met by 23,000 police and National Guardsmen. When asked about anti-war demonstrators, Daley repeated to reporters that \"no thousands will come to our city and take over our streets, our city, our convention\".\nDaley later said his primary reason for calling in so many Guardsmen and police was reports he received of plots to assassinate Democratic Party leaders including himself. One of Daley's aides told the media that the anti-war demonstrators were \"revolutionaries bent on the destruction of America\". When the media reported that Daley had given orders to the police to restrict the activities of Democratic delegates loyal to McCarthy, Daley gave an outraged press conference saying, \"This is a vicious attack on this city and its mayor\".\nThe leaders of the Yippies (Youth International Party), Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, specialized in outlandish, bizarre rhetoric to provoke media attention, and Daley took many of their outrageous threats seriously. \nDaley and the media.\nDaley's heavy-handed security measures incensed the media. Walter Cronkite complained of \"a totally unwarranted restriction of free and rapid access to information\". With the convention taking place days after the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, Eric Sevareid stated that Chicago \"runs the city of Prague a close second right now as the world's least attractive tourist destination\".\nOn the second night of the convention, CBS News correspondent Dan Rather was grabbed by security guards and roughed up while trying to interview a Georgia delegate being escorted out of the building. CBS News anchorman Walter Cronkite turned his attention towards the area where Rather was reporting from the convention floor. Rather was grabbed by security guards after he walked toward the delegate who was being hauled out, and asked him, \"What is your name, sir?\" Rather was wearing a microphone headset and was then heard on national television repeatedly saying to the guards \"don't push me\" and \"take your hands off me unless you plan to arrest me\".\nAfter the guards let go of Rather, he told Cronkite:\"Walter ... we tried to talk to the man and we got violently pushed out of the way. This is the kind of thing that has been going on outside the hall, this is the first time we've had it happen inside the hall. We ... I'm sorry to be out of breath, but somebody belted me in the stomach during that. What happened is a Georgia delegate, at least he had a Georgia delegate sign on, was being hauled out of the hall. We tried to talk to him to see why, who he was, what the situation was, and at that instant the security people, well as you can see, put me on the deck. I didn't do very well.\" An angry Cronkite tersely replied, \"I think we've got a bunch of thugs here, Dan.\"\nOn the last night, NBC News switched back and forth between images of the violence to the festivities over Humphrey's victory in the convention hall, highlighting the division in the Democratic Party.\n\"Gestapo tactics\" Ribicoff incident.\nDaley's security measures were so intense that it was not possible to walk across the convention floor without jostling other delegates, which added to the tensions as Democrats fiercely argued about whether to accept Johnson's war plank to the platform. All of it was captured live on national television. Pro-war Democrats challenged the presence of the economist John Kenneth Galbraith, who was serving as the floor manager for McCarthy, and sought to have him expelled. Inside the convention hall were televisions showing the police beating and clubbing demonstrators outside, which increased the tension. Robert Maytag, the chairman of the Colorado delegation asked: \"Is there any rule under which Mayor Daley can be compelled to suspend the police state terror being perpetrated at this minute on kids in front of the Conrad Hilton [hotel]?\" Daley's face flushed with anger while his supporters began to boo Maytag.\nOn the convention floor, Senator Abraham Ribicoff rose to give a speech nominating McGovern as the Democratic candidate. During his speech, Ribicoff pointed to Daley and said: \"With George McGovern, we wouldn't have Gestapo tactics on the streets of Chicago,\" as raucous dissension broke out. Daley rose up to scream at Ribicoff (as interpreted by lip readers): \"Fuck you, you Jew son of bitch! You lousy motherfucker! Go home!\" Ribicoff mildly replied: \"How hard it is to accept the truth. How hard it is.\" Four of Daley's Chicago officials jumped up to usher Ribicoff away, helped by Daley's bodyguards.\nDefenders of the mayor would later claim that he was calling Ribicoff a faker, a charge denied by Daley and refuted by Mike Royko's reporting.\nDaley\u2019s response to convention demonstrations.\nDespite attempts to forestall such activity, there were numerous demonstrations on the floor throughout the convention by the disenchanted delegates that Daley was helpless to stop. The head of the Wisconsin delegation, Donald Peterson, spurred one such demonstration when he called at the end of Day 2 for the convention to adjourn until the next morning right before the Vietnam plank was to begin its debate. Daley and the convention chair Carl Albert attempted to resist and shut down the adjournment motion, but when the tired delegates rallied behind the motion, Daley would reverse his opposition and second the motion to adjourn, to which chairman Albert finally relented.\nOn the final day of the convention, a tribute video for Robert F. Kennedy was shown to the delegates and the home viewing audience. The tribute moved some delegates to tears and eventually the entire convention into song. The delegates sang \u201cBattle Hymn of the Republic,\u201d which was also sung at his widow Ethel\u2019s request at the end of his funeral. Chairman Albert attempted to continue with the convention, but his multiple requests for order in the convention were ignored. Daley also showed noticeable displeasure with the demonstration. The convention sang for over 10 minutes before Chicago alderman and future congressman Ralph Metcalfe was able to recapture the convention\u2019s attention to offer memoriam to Martin Luther King Jr.\nProtests and police response.\nPreparations.\nIn 1968, the Yippies and the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam (MOBE) had already begun planning a youth festival in Chicago to coincide with the convention, and other groups such as the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) would also make their presence known. Two SDS leaders, Tom Hayden and Rennie Davis, had planned to keep their protests peaceful, although the lack of permits and threats of violence by the Chicago police made this unlikely to happen. Todd Gitlin, another SDS leader, was highly worried about the potential for violence, and at a speech paraphrased a lyric from \"San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)\", saying: \"If you're going to Chicago, be sure to wear some armor in your hair\".\nChicago mayor Daley thought that one way to prevent \"anti-patriotic\" demonstrators from coming to Chicago was to refuse to grant permits which would allow for people to protest legally. The mayor announced restrictions on how close protestors could approach the convention, on their numbers, and on their activities, making very clear his hostility to protesters in his city.\nOver 10,000 people had arrived in Chicago to protest the Vietnam War. Daley had the International Amphitheatre, where the convention was being held, ringed with barbed wire while putting the 11,000 officers of the Chicago Police Department on twelve-hour shifts. In addition, there were 6,000 armed men from the Illinois National Guard called up to guard the International Amphitheatre, adding up to a total of 23,000 police and National Guardsmen. Intelligence agents had infiltrated among the protesters, including some from the Central Intelligence Agency, who \u2013 contrary to American law \u2013 had been sent to spy upon domestic politics. The Chicago police raided the mostly black neighborhoods of South Chicago to stage mass arrests of the Blackstone Rangers, a black power group that was allegedly planning to assassinate Humphrey.\nYippie publicity stunts.\nThe leaders of the Yippies (Youth International Party), Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, attempted to provoke authorities by proclaiming: \"We are dirty, smelly, grimy and foul...we will piss and shit and fuck in public...we will be constantly stoned or tripping on every drug known to man\". Surrounded by reporters on August 23, 1968, Yippie leader Rubin, folk singer Phil Ochs, and other activists held their own convention with their candidate Pigasus, an actual pig. When the Yippies paraded Pigasus at the Civic Center, ten policemen arrested Ochs, Rubin, Pigasus, and six others, attracting media attention.\nA peaceful demonstration was held in Lincoln Park led by Rubin and Hoffman, with the Yippie leaders calling the demonstrators to respect the 11pm curfew. The Beatnik poet Allen Ginsberg ended the demonstration by chanting \"Om\". The next day was supposed to be the \"Festival of Life\" in Lincoln Park, but the police confiscated the truck upon which a rock band was to play. The demonstrators and police began shouting insults at each other while the police fired tear gas into the crowd and beat up the photographers and journalists present. Tom Hayden, one of the leaders of the SDS and co-organizer of the protests, was arrested.\nThe next day, what was billed as \"Unbirthday Party\" for President Johnson was planned to be held in Lincoln Park. Hayden, who had been freed on bail after his arrest the previous day, attended the \"Unbirthday Party\". He was recognized by a policeman, Constable Ralph Bell, who beat him and then arrested him for violating his bail conditions. Also attending the \"Unbirthday Party\" were Rubin and Bobby Seale of the Black Panther Party, who both called for \"roasting pigs\" in their speeches. In the evening, a demonstration was held at Grant Park opposite the Hilton Hotel, which was peaceful as bands such as Peter, Paul and Mary played folk music. When 600 Illinois National Guardsmen appeared, Hayden, who had been bailed out a second time, picked up his megaphone to shout that everybody should go home.\nRiots.\nOn August 28, 1968, around 10,000 protesters gathered in Grant Park for the demonstration, intending to march to the International Amphitheatre where the convention was being held. At approximately 3:30\u00a0pm, a young man lowered the American flag that was in the park. The police broke through the crowd and began beating the young man, while the crowd pelted the police with food, rocks, and chunks of concrete. The chants of some of the protesters shifted from, \"Hell no, we won't go!\" to, \"Pigs are whores!\"\nHayden encouraged protesters to move out of the park to ensure that if the police used tear gas on them, it would have to be done throughout the city. The police regained control of the situation after firing tear gas and chased the demonstrators down the streets, beating them with clubs and rifle butts and arresting them. The amount of tear gas used to suppress the protesters was so great that it made its way to the Conrad Hilton, where it disturbed Humphrey while in his shower. The police sprayed demonstrators and bystanders with mace and were taunted by some protesters with chants of, \"Kill, kill, kill!\" The police responded by shouting, \"Get out of here, you cocksuckers!\". Police indiscriminately attacked all who were present, regardless of if they were involved in the demonstrations or not. Dick Gregory, the comedian who attended the protests, told the crowd that the police were merely following the orders of Daley and \"the crooks downtown\".\nThe MOBE leaders then decided to march down Michigan Avenue to the Conrad Hilton hotel, where many of the Democratic delegates were staying. The Illinois National Guard guarding the hotel fired tear gas while the police moved in to beat the demonstrators. The police assault in front of the hotel during the evening of August 28 became the most famous image of the Chicago demonstrations of 1968, as the entire event took place live under television lights for seventeen minutes while the crowd chanted, \"The whole world is watching\". Samuel Brown, one of the organizers for Senator McCarthy, lamented the violence, saying: \"Instead of nice young people ringing doorbells, the public saw the image of mobs shouting obscenities and disrupting the city\". Brown stated the demonstrations at Chicago had been a disaster for the anti-war movement, as the American people saw the protesters as the trouble-makers and the heavy-handed police response as justified. The general feeling at the time was the hippies were intent upon destroying everything good in America and the Chicago police had acted correctly in beating such dangerous anti-social types bloody.\u00a0In a telephone call to President Johnson on Saturday, September 7, 1968, Daley described some of the activity undertaken by elements of the protesters, which he described as \"Professional Trouble Makers\". These activities included the burning of the American Flag, raising of the Viet Cong flag and throwing both manure and urine at the police.\nAftermath.\nThe Chicago Study Team (Walker Report) that investigated the violent clashes between police and protesters at the convention stated that the police response was characterized by:\nunrestrained and indiscriminate police violence on many occasions, particularly at night. That violence was made all the more shocking by the fact that it was often inflicted upon persons who had broken no law, disobeyed no order, made no threat. These included peaceful demonstrators, onlookers, and large numbers of residents who were simply passing through, or happened to live in, the areas where confrontations were occurring.\nThe Walker Report, \"headed by an independent observer from Los Angeles police \u2013 concluded that: 'Individual policemen, and lots of them, committed violent acts far in excess of the requisite force for crowd dispersal or arrest. To read dispassionately the hundreds of statements describing at firsthand the events of Sunday and Monday nights is to become convinced of the presence of what can only be called a police riot.'\"\nAccording to \"The Guardian\", \"[a]fter four days and nights of violence, 668 people had been arrested, 425 demonstrators were treated at temporary medical facilities, 200 were treated on the spot, 400 given first aid for tear gas exposure and 110 went to hospital. A total of 192 police officers were injured.\"\nAfter the Chicago protests, some demonstrators believed the majority of Americans would side with them over what had happened in Chicago, especially because of police behavior. The controversy over the war in Vietnam overshadowed their cause. Daley shared he had received 135,000 letters supporting his actions and only 5,000 condemning them. Public opinion polls demonstrated that the majority of Americans supported the mayor's tactics. It was often commented through the popular media that on that evening, America decided to vote for Richard Nixon.\nAfter the convention, which had very publicly exposed the fault-lines between hawkish and dovish Democrats, Humphrey was 22 points behind Nixon in the polls. By contrast to the violence and chaos in Chicago, the Republican convention in Miami had been a model of order and unity, which made Nixon appear better qualified to be president as even Humphrey himself conceded in private.\nOn September 30, 1968, Humphrey gave a speech in Salt Lake City that he had intended to deliver at the convention in Chicago, saying he was willing to unconditionally stop the bombing of North Vietnam to break the deadlock in the peace talks in Paris. At this point, Humphrey, who was behind in the polls, saw his numbers began to rise; Nixon was certainly concerned in October 1968 that he might lose the election. By late October 1968, Humphrey had a slight lead with 44% intending to vote for him compared to 43% for Nixon. The election of 1968 was one of the closest ever in American history with Nixon winning 31.7\u00a0million votes, Humphrey 31.2\u00a0million votes and Wallace 10 million votes.\nChicago Seven.\nA grand jury charged eight defendants with conspiracy, crossing state lines with intent to incite a riot, and other federal crimes following the 1968 Democratic National Convention. The defendants became known as the Chicago Eight: Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Tom Hayden, Bobby Seale, Rennie Davis, David Dellinger, John Froines, and Lee Weiner. During the trial, the case against Bobby Seale was declared a mistrial, and the Chicago Eight then became the Chicago Seven. Demonstrations were held daily during the trial, organized by the MOBE, the Young Lords led by Jose Cha Cha Jimenez, and the local Black Panther Party led by chairman Fred Hampton. In February 1970, five of the seven defendants were convicted of crossing state lines with intent to incite a riot, and all were acquitted of conspiracy. Froines and Weiner were acquitted on all charges.\nWhile the jury was deliberating, Judge Julius Hoffman sentenced the defendants and their attorneys to jail terms ranging from &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2+1\u20442 months to 4 years for contempt of court. In 1972, the convictions were reversed on appeal, and the government declined to bring the case to trial again.\nThe McGovern\u2013Fraser Commission.\nIn response to the party disunity and electoral failure that came out of the convention, the party established the Commission on Party Structure and Delegate Selection (informally known as the McGovern\u2013Fraser Commission), to examine current rules on the ways candidates were nominated and make recommendations designed to broaden participation and enable better representation for minorities and others who were underrepresented. The commission documented that in many places in America the Democratic Party was \"an autocratic, authoritarian organization\" that engaged in the \"shameful exploitation of the voter\".\nThe commission established more open procedures and affirmative action guidelines for selecting delegates. The changes imposed by the commission required that the number of delegates who were Black, women, Hispanic and between the ages of 18 and 30 reflected the proportion of the people in those groups in every congressional district. In addition the commission required all delegate selection procedures to be open; party leaders could no longer handpick the delegates in secret. The changes brought about by the commission ended the ability of local bosses who headed political machines such as Daley to ensure delegations that were subservient to them attended conventions. The rule changes brought by the commission also marked the beginning of the end of the Democratic delegations that were almost entirely male and usually entirely white, ensuring in the future Democratic delegations would be more diverse. An unforeseen result of these rules was a large shift toward state presidential primaries. Prior to the reforms, Democrats in two-thirds of the states used state conventions to choose convention delegates. In the post-reform era, over three-quarters of the states use primary elections to choose delegates, and over 80% of convention delegates are selected in these primaries.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "42632", "revid": "635492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42632", "title": "Flood (They Might Be Giants album)", "text": "Flood is the third studio album by American alternative rock duo They Might Be Giants, released in January 1990. \"Flood\" was the duo's first album on the major label Elektra Records. It generated three singles: \"Birdhouse in Your Soul\", \"Istanbul (Not Constantinople)\", and the domestic promotional track \"Twisting\". \nThe album is generally considered to be the band's definitive release, as it is their best-selling and most recognizable album, and is regarded by some as one of the best albums of the 1990s. Despite minimal stylistic and instrumental differences from previous releases, \"Flood\" is distinguished by contributions from seasoned producers Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley. John Linnell and John Flansburgh also took advantage of new equipment and recording techniques, including unconventional, home-recorded samples, which were programmed through Casio FZ-1 synthesizers. The album was recorded in New York City at Skyline Studios, which was better equipped than studios the band had worked in previously.\nPromotion for \"Flood\" included television appearances, promotional videos, and an international tour. The album's mainstream promotion and success contributed to its status as the band's most well known album. Many fans, including young viewers of \"Tiny Toon Adventures\", were first exposed to They Might Be Giants's music through \"Flood\".\nThe album was initially issued on CD, LP, and cassette. Upon its release, \"Flood\" was met with praise from critics and achieved moderate success on sales charts. In 2013, the album was reissued as part of a CD series spanning They Might Be Giants' four Elektra releases. In 2014, it was reissued on LP in Europe by Music On Vinyl and in the United States by Asbestos Records for Record Store Day and Black Friday, and it was reissued again on LP in 2015 and in 2023 on the band's label, Idlewild Recordings.\nBackground.\n\"Flood\" was They Might Be Giants' first release on a major label. Elektra Records approached the band in 1989 following the unexpected success of their second album, \"Lincoln\", which was released on the independent Bar/None label. The record deal that Elektra presented was largely due to the work of Susan Drew, an A&amp;R worker who had been following the band since 1986. Because of her confidence, the band was given an extensive level of creative control over their projects, in addition to the ability to take advantage of the label's resources. Although They Might Be Giants recorded the album as a duo, they were joined by several guest musicians on brass and string instruments. The band also enlisted Alan Bezozi to help program some of the electronic drums for the album.\nRecording and production.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"We had never been in an actual, real, multitrack studio before. We had been in an 8-track studio run by a friend of ours that was essentially a demo place. But I didn't know anything about how to make a real record\u00a0... [Langer and Winstanley] approach production the way that we approach songwriting. That is, we let the song take us in whatever direction it seems to want to go.\"\n\u2014 John Flansburgh\nThe album was recorded in the fall of 1989 at Skyline Studios in New York City. Skyline was only a few blocks away from the Public Access Synthesizer Studio, where the band had recorded their previous albums. Alan Bezozi and John Flansburgh worked together to create atypical drum tracks, including one that samples the sound of Flansburgh's kitchen sink and refrigerator being struck with a drum stick. An Alesis SR-16 drum machine was used to program the drums.\nTwo-thirds of the album's budget was exhausted for the production of four songs: \"Birdhouse in Your Soul\", \"Your Racist Friend\", \"We Want a Rock\", and \"Istanbul (Not Constantinople)\". These four tracks were produced by Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley.\nStyle and composition.\nLike many of They Might Be Giants' early releases, \"Flood\" features a range of stylistic eclecticism. The press release for the album notes the \"rock rave-up 'Twisting'\u00a0... the [country] inflected 'Lucky Ball &amp; Chain'\u00a0... the existential oom-pah of 'Particle Man'\", and \"tender night-light metaphor and melody\" of the lead single, \"Birdhouse in Your Soul\". Jon Pareles wrote for \"The New York Times\" that the album \"shrug[s] off most typecasting\". He added that through releases like \"Flood\", They Might Be Giants and a new wave of alternative musicians were gainsaying the standard practice of sticking to only one genre.\nRegardless of the genre employed, They Might Be Giants are noted for unconventional lyrics, characterized by \"bizarre\" cleverness. \"Flood\" includes abundant examples of this style, manifested in unusual subject matter, unreliable narrators, and wordplay. However, John Linnell and Flansburgh took care to avoid using humor excessively, acknowledging the requirement that recorded music withstand repeated listens without losing value. Linnell has pointed out that in general, he writes melodies prior to writing lyrics. This creates the challenge of fitting the appropriate syllables and stresses into each line; often, demos were recorded with dummy lyrics to simplify the process. Linnell's melodies are often based around scales. D. X. Ferris, with commentary from John Linnell and John Flansburgh, outlined each individual track from \"Flood\" in a retrospective article published in \"Rolling Stone\".\n\"Theme From Flood\" acts as a tongue-in-cheek introduction to the album, and it is regarded by scholars Elizabeth Sandifer and Alex Reed to be one of the first in a recurring trend of processional tunes composed by John Linnell. It is followed by the album's lead single, \"Birdhouse in Your Soul\". Although the melody for \"Birdhouse\" was written years prior to the lyrics, the lyrics were \"shoehorned in to match the melody\", according to Linnell. The narrative is given from the point of view of a child's nightlight. According to John Linnell, the song was almost wrecked when he attempted to underscore it with a more dramatic drum track. Producers Winstanley and Langer opposed this decision and the drum track was scrapped. Linnell speculates that had this not been the case, the entire album might have suffered. Reed and Sandifer also note that the song makes an unanticipated jump from the key of C major to E-flat major and then back to C major. The track's later shifts to F-sharp minor and A major lead to the division of the octave into equal intervals. Reed and Sandifer call \"Flood\" in general \"modular\" in its movement between musical ideas, which they accredit partly to its largely digital composition: the band's MIDI sequencer made it easy to transpose sections of a song out of the original key.\n\"Lucky Ball and Chain\" employs the unreliable narrator motif, according to Linnell. Influenced by the country-western musical tradition, the song is a \"simple regret song\" dealing with \"the one that got away\". The fourth track and second single, \"Istanbul (Not Constantinople)\", a cover of the 1953 original, was added by Flansburgh and Linnell to their repertoire in the early 1980s to lengthen their live sets. From that point, it evolved from a folk-inspired cover to the baroque pop rendition that appears on \"Flood\". A Casio FZ-1 synthesizer was used to perform the song in the studio. \"Dead\", described by \"Rolling Stone\" as \"one of TMBG's most abstract and personal songs\", follows the story of someone dying and then being \"reincarnated as a bag of groceries\". According to Linnell, \"The dreamlike relationship between returning expired groceries and returning from the grave after you expire appealed to me.\"\n\"Your Racist Friend\", produced by Langer and Winstanley, is a politically charged song which follows a fairly straightforward narrative. The song, which depicts a social conflict, is considered to be the band's most clear \"political statement\". On the other hand, the accordion-tinged \"Particle Man\" lightheartedly chronicles the disputes of four characters, the titular Particle Man, Universe Man, Person Man, and Triangle Man. Linnell has claimed that the character Triangle Man was inspired by Robert Mitchum's appearance in the 1955 film \"The Night of the Hunter\". The final single, \"Twisting\", was selected over \"Your Racist Friend\", in part because it was more lyrically ambiguous. The song references both The Young Fresh Fellows and The dB's, two groups that influenced the sound of the track itself. Flansburgh has noted that, while recording the song, Bezozi accidentally erased the entire drum track for \"Twisting\". Flansburgh then had to recreate the track from scratch. The cryptic \"We Want a Rock\" features a violin performance by Mark Feldman, and \"Someone Keeps Moving My Chair\" revolves around petty concerns and their importance \"when everything else is going haywire\". \"Hearing Aid\" features the mixing of standard They Might Be Giants sounds with an Arto Lindsay guitar solo and vacuum cleaner synth sounds, experimentations that Flansburgh found difficult to achieve.\n\"Minimum Wage\", which features only those two words, saw the band dabbling in sampling (specifically the 1966 Frank Sinatra recording of \"Downtown\"). The sound of the whip was crafted in the studio when the band was unable to find a suitable stock sound effect; the effect was a composite of a wind sound from Linnell's Moog keyboard and the crack of a wet towel, courtesy of Roger Moutenot. \"Letterbox\", which was also considered as a potential single from the album, was another track that had been in live setlists years prior to the release of the album. For \"Whistling in the Dark\", Flansburgh and Linnell wanted the bass drum to be extremely pronounced, although they were later unhappy with the result. Linnell noted that, lyrically, the song is about two men who engage in a fight, only for the listener to soon learn that they are both in prison. \"Hot Cha!\" references the name of a wooden horse in the Parker Brothers board game \"Derby Day\"; musically, the song is a mix of eclectic sounds (such as the noise of mallets and drumsticks banging on a sink and base of a refrigerator), samples (such as a door buzzer), and unique recording methods (such as running horn samples through a guitar fuzz box). In the cheerful tune \"Women and Men\", the band examines human reproduction from a \"disengaged view\", and \"Sapphire Bullets of Pure Love\" takes its title from a Mahavishnu Orchestra album cut of the same name. \"They Might Be Giants\" operates as the band's manifesto and was inspired by The Monkees song \"(Theme From) The Monkees\". \"Flood\" concludes with \"Road Movie to Berlin\", which was written by John Flansburgh in Germany in 1989 (at which point the Berlin Wall still stood). The song deals with the clash between absurdism and existentialism that the band encountered while touring Europe. Flansburgh's voice was slowed down for this song, an effect that he later called \"creepy\". Due to the haste with which the final portion of the album was recorded, the band accidentally forgot to include an entire verse of the song in the finished product; Linnell and Flansburgh felt that they did not have the time to fix it, so the mistake remained. The song also makes use of \"synthetic or sampled\" trumpet sounds, one of which was also included in \"Birdhouse in Your Soul\".\nArtwork.\nThe photograph used for the cover of the album depicts a man rowing a boat made out of strung-together washbasins. The image was captured by Margaret Bourke-White as part of a series taken to document the Ohio River flood of 1937. The cover, which was designed by band member John Flansburgh with Elizabeth van Itallie, originally featured only the photo; however, an emblem including the band's name, inked by Flansburgh's former coworker Barbara Lipp, was later added. The emblem resembles the logo of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees.\nPromotion.\nTo promote \"Flood\", Elektra produced a promotional video featuring Linnell and Flansburgh facetiously extolling the album's merits. One sarcastic quip was that the album included nineteen songs, which made it inherently better than other albums with fewer tracks. The video also included a live performance of \"Particle Man\" and a sample of the lead single \"Birdhouse in Your Soul\". The band also produced a music video, directed by Adam Bernstein, for \"Birdhouse in Your Soul\". In April, the band appeared on \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" to perform the song with Doc Severinsen and the Tonight Show Band. Severinsen's unusually fast count-in resulted in a performance with a noticeably higher tempo than the album recording. Linnell and Flansburgh would later adopt a similar tempo for subsequent live performances.\nTour.\nIn support of \"Flood\", They Might Be Giants toured North America and Europe, including a series of shows in Germany. Due to the scale of the tour, the band's road crew doubled in size\u2014increasing from two members to four. Linnell and Flansburgh have recounted the unfamiliarity of touring outside of North America. In Europe, they report that crowds acted differently due to cultural gaps.\nThe band continued to tour as a duo, with Linnell playing accordion and Flansburgh on guitars, or occasionally playing a marching band bass drum. Large posters of postage stamps adorned the stage as props; the minimal arrangement was received as a boldly simple choice. Sets included a combination of old and new material. As in the past, the band was backed by a tape deck playing drum tracks or a metronome in lieu of a full rhythm section.\nReception.\nCritical reception.\n\"Flood\" received generally positive reviews, though some critics expressed reservations. Chris Heim wrote for the \"Chicago Tribune\" that the album is a rare example of success for a \"quirky cult band\" signed to a major label. Steve Simels, writing for \"Stereo Review\", compared the album's structural complexities to The Beach Boys at the peak of their career. Simels praised the album's originality and intellect, while heavily criticizing other contemporary music for lacking those characteristics. Writing in \"Spin\", Ira Robbins called \"Flood\" \"another captivating variety show of art-rock, swing, the Bonzo Dog Band, cow-pop, show tunes and the Schmenge Brothers\u00a0... Boundless imagination, loopy mix-and-match arrangements and a gyroscopic sense of what makes a pop tune click are still responsible for the easy and abiding appeal of TMBG's ingenious material.\" In a retrospective AllMusic review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that despite some inconsistencies and awkward selections, the album is musically superior to its predecessors. He observed that through \"Flood\", Flansburgh and Linnell \"exchange quirky artiness for unabashed geekiness\". Six of the album's nineteen tracks are designated as AllMusic \"picks\". Reviewing the album in 2022 for \"Pitchfork\", Quinn Moreland commented that the duo's \"ability to grab listeners with sharp, catchy songwriting was never more evident than on\u00a0... \"Flood\", where their expansive imagination was matched by major label money.\"\nReviews in the UK were also mostly positive. In a review for \"Q\", Peter Kane lauded the record for its uniqueness and for the sheer quantity of tracks, which he said ensured that the listener would enjoy at least one song, and concluded that \"Flood\" was \"as playful an entertainment as will be heard all year\". In \"NME\" Jerry Smith called the collection \"a weird and wonderful varied combination of the zany, trivial, witty and wacky, delivered with a spritely foot-tapping ease that belies their bizarre subject matter\". \"Record Mirror\"'s Iestyn George observed that \"if it's to be faulted, the album is a mite too cluttered for its own good, but the virtues of imagination and originality that these native New Yorkers display are worthy of enthusiastic approval\". Andy Ross of \"Sounds\" believed that it was the duo's melodic talents that prevented them from becoming just a novelty act, and wrote that \"Flood\" was \"a real cryptic crossword of an album, requiring perseverance and application with ultimately rewarding and fulfilling results\".\nConversely, \"Village Voice\" critic Robert Christgau and \"Rolling Stone\"'s David Browne found \"Flood\" to be unremarkable overall. Both critics chastised the band's novelty, which they found to be wearing thin as time progressed. In the UK Caroline Sullivan of \"Melody Maker\" felt that enjoyment of \"Flood\" \"hinges upon one's general feelings about similarly zany characters like Talking Heads and Frank Zappa. If their very American, very beatnik, surrealism spells instant yawnorama, forget TMBG\u2014they're the same thing, but minus the good tunes.\" However, in a 2009 \"Rolling Stone\" article revisiting \"Flood\" near its twentieth anniversary, D. X. Ferris praised the album as both the band's most iconic release and one that revolutionized the college radio scene.\nCommercial response.\n\"Flood\" peaked at number 75 on the \"Billboard\" 200, spending 22 weeks on the chart. The lead single from the album, \"Birdhouse in Your Soul\", reached number three on the \"Billboard\" Modern Rock Tracks chart. The single also charted in Ireland and the UK. \"Twisting\", which was released as a domestic promotional single, peaked at number 22 on the \"Billboard\" Modern Rock Tracks chart. The album also contains two of the band's most well known songs, \"Istanbul (Not Constantinople)\" and \"Particle Man\". The former was released as a single, reaching number 61 on the UK Singles Chart, but failed to chart in the US.\n\"Flood\" was the first album released by They Might Be Giants to receive the RIAA Platinum sales award\u2014indicating sales over one million copies\u2014which it achieved on July 10, 2009. It is also certified Gold by the BPI in the United Kingdom.\nLegacy.\n\"Flood\" is They Might Be Giants' best-selling album, and it is widely regarded as their most iconic. Due to the acclaim with which it was received, the album is considered to have cemented the band's reputation as a staple of alternative and college rock. Curtis Silver, in a retrospective for \"Wired\", collected anecdotes from They Might Be Giants fans, many of whom were first exposed to the band through \"Flood\". Silver concluded that new fans are drawn just as much to the band's old material as they are their more recent work, due to its sustaining accessibility. In fact, many fans cite the band's earliest albums as their favorites\u2014though often not \"Flood\", despite (or perhaps due to) its longstanding mainstream success. Pitchfork ranked it the 25th best album of the 1990s, while\nStrange Currencies ranked it the 80th best of the 1990s,\nand Treble named it the 95th best out of 150.\nIn April 1990, the band performed \"Birdhouse in Your Soul\" on \"The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson\", in a faster-tempo version accompanied by bandleader Doc Severinsen and the Tonight Show Band.\nIn February 1991, \"Tiny Toon Adventures\" aired animated music videos for two tracks from the album, \"Particle Man\" and \"Istanbul (Not Constantinople)\". Through the program, the band was exposed to a younger set of fans. This ultimately led the band to begin releasing children's music alongside their \"rock albums\" over a decade later.\nThey Might Be Giants has performed \"Flood\" live in its entirety on numerous occasions. In 2015, the band released the live album \"Flood Live in Australia\", a recording of the album played live in 2013, in which the songs are performed in reverse order, starting with \"Road Movie to Berlin\" and ending with \"Theme from Flood\". The band has performed multiple \"Flood\" concerts in the reverse-order format. In other shows, the songs are played out of sequence.\nThe band planned to perform a series of \"Flood\" concerts in early 2020 to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the album's release, but the tour was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The dates were rescheduled to between September 2020 and May 2021, but these were also postponed. Following this, the shows were rescheduled in early 2022, with 43 dates from June 2022 to May 2023. Some early tour dates were additionally postponed to later in the schedule due to Flansburgh suffering broken ribs in a car accident.\nPersonnel.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChart performance.\nAlbum\nSingles\nRelease history.\n\"Flood\" was released in CD, LP, and cassette formats both in the United States and foreign markets by Elektra Records. In addition to two vinyl reissues in 2014, the entire album was included in a two-part 2013 CD compilation that collected They Might Be Giants's work from their period with Elektra.\nReferences.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
