The class is designed for a broad spectrum of open-ocean and littoral missions, including anti-submarine warfare and intelligence gathering operations. They are scheduled to replace older \"Los Angeles\"-class attack submarines, many of which have already been decommissioned, as well as four cruise missile submarine variants of the \"Ohio\"-class submarines. Upon the 25 July 2025 decommissioning of the \"Los Angeles\"-class submarine USS \"Helena\" (SSN-725), the \"Virginia\"-class became the most numerous active submarine class in the world.\n\"Virginia\"-class submarines will be acquired through 2043, and are expected to remain in service until at least 2060, with later submarines expected to operate into the 2070s.\nOn 14 March 2023, the trilateral Australian-British-American security pact known as AUKUS announced that the Royal Australian Navy would purchase three \"Virginia\"-class submarines as a stopgap measure between the retirement of their conventionally powered s and the acquisition of the future SSN-AUKUS class submarines. If SSN-AUKUS falls behind schedule, Australia will have the option of purchasing two additional \"Virginia\"-class submarines.\nHistory.\nThe class was developed under the codename Centurion, later renamed New SSN (NSSN). The \"Centurion Study\" was initiated in February 1991. The \"Virginia\"-class submarine was the first US Navy warship with its development coordinated using such 3D visualization technology as CATIA, which comprises computer-aided engineering (CAE), computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and product lifecycle management (PLM). Design problems for Electric Boat\u2014and maintenance problems for the Navy\u2014ensued nonetheless.\nBy 2007 approximately 35 million labor hours had been spent to design the \"Virginia\" class. Constructing a single \"Virginia\"-class submarine has required around nine million labor hours, and over 4,000 suppliers. Each submarine is projected to make 14\u201315 deployments during its 33-year service life.\nThe \"Virginia\" class was intended in part as a less expensive alternative to the ($1.8\u00a0billion vs $2.8\u00a0billion), whose production run was canceled after just three boats had been completed. To reduce costs, the \"Virginia\"-class submarines use many \"commercial off-the-shelf\" (COTS) components, especially in their computers and data networks. Improvements in shipbuilding technology have trimmed production costs below the $1.8\u00a0billion projected fiscal year 2009 dollars.\nIn hearings before both House of Representatives and Senate committees, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) and expert witnesses testified that the annual procurement rate of only one \"Virginia\"-class boat\u2014rising to two in 2012\u2014would result in excessive unit production costs, yet an insufficient complement of attack submarines. In a 10 March 2005 statement to the House Armed Services Committee, Ronald O'Rourke of the CRS testified that, assuming that the production rate remains as planned, \"production economies of scale for submarines would continue to remain limited or poor.\"\nIn 2001, Newport News Shipbuilding and the General Dynamics Electric Boat Company built a quarter-scale version of a \"Virginia\"-class submarine dubbed Large Scale Vehicle II (LSV II) \"Cutthroat\". The vehicle was designed as an affordable test platform for new technologies.\nThe \"Virginia\" class is built through an industrial arrangement designed to maintain both GD Electric Boat and Newport News Shipbuilding, the only two U.S. shipyards capable of building nuclear-powered submarines. Under the present arrangement, the Newport News facility builds the stern, habitability, machinery spaces, torpedo room, sail, and bow, while Electric Boat builds the engine room and control room. The facilities alternate work on the reactor plant as well as the final assembly, test, outfit, and delivery.\nO'Rourke wrote in 2004 that, \"Compared to a one-yard strategy, approaches involving two yards may be more expensive but offer potential offsetting benefits.\" Among the claims of \"offsetting benefits\" that O'Rourke attributes to supporters of a two-facility construction arrangement is that it \"would permit the United States to continue building submarines at one yard even if the other yard is rendered incapable of building submarines permanently or for a sustained period of time by a catastrophic event of some kind\", including an enemy attack.\nTo get the submarine's price down to $2\u00a0billion per submarine in FY-05 dollars, the Navy instituted a cost-reduction program to shave off approximately $400\u00a0million of each submarine's price tag. The project was dubbed \"2 for 4 in 12\", referring to the Navy's desire to buy two boats for $4\u00a0billion in FY-12. Under pressure from Congress, the Navy opted to start buying two boats per year in FY-11, meaning that officials would not be able to get the $2\u00a0billion price tag before the service started buying two submarines per year. However, program manager Dave Johnson said at a conference on 19 March 2008 that the program was only $30\u00a0million away from achieving the $2\u00a0billion price goal, and would reach that target on schedule.\nThe \"Virginia\"-class Program Office received the David Packard Excellence in Acquisition Award in 1996, 1998, and 2008 \"for excelling in four specific award criteria: reducing life-cycle costs; making the acquisition system more efficient, responsive, and timely; integrating defense with the commercial base and practices; and promoting continuous improvement of the acquisition process.\"\nIn December 2008, the Navy signed a $14\u00a0billion contract with General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman to supply eight submarines. The contract required the delivery of one submarine in each of fiscal 2009 and 2010, and two submarines on each of fiscal 2011, 2012, and 2013. This contract was designed to bring the Navy's \"Virginia\"-class fleet to 18 submarines. In December 2010, the United States Congress passed a defense authorization bill that expanded production to two subs per year. Two submarine-per-year production resumed on 2 September 2011 with commencement of construction.\nOn 21 June 2008, the Navy christened , the first Block II submarine. This boat was delivered eight months ahead of schedule and $54\u00a0million under budget. Block\u00a0II boats are built in four sections, compared to the ten sections of the Block I boats. This enables a cost saving of about $300\u00a0million per boat, reducing the overall cost to $2\u00a0billion per boat and the construction of two new boats per year. Beginning in 2010, new submarines of this class were to have included a software system that can monitor and reduce their electromagnetic signatures when needed.\nThe first full-duration six-month deployment was successfully carried out from 15 October 2009 to 13 April 2010. Authorization of full-rate production and the declaration of full operational capability was achieved five months later. In September 2010, it was found that urethane tiles, applied to the hull to damp internal sound and absorb rather than reflect sonar pulses, were falling off while the subs were at sea. Admiral Kevin McCoy announced that the problems with the Mold-in-Place Special Hull Treatment for the early subs had been fixed in 2011, then \"Minnesota\" was built and found to have the same problem.\nIn 2013, just as two-per-year sub construction was supposed to commence, Congress failed to resolve the United States fiscal cliff, forcing the Navy to attempt to \"de-obligate\" construction funds.\nIn April 2019, the CRS reported that the Navy estimated the cost of a boat was $2.8\u00a0billion. In July 2023, the CRS reported that the Navy estimates at the present production rate of two boats per year that the cost per boat when equipped with the additional Virginia Payload Module (VPM) mid-body section was $4.3\u00a0billion.\nOn 14 September 2023, at a Senate confirmation hearing, Admiral Lisa Franchetti said that the US Navy would have to work with builders to raise the rate of production from 1.2/year to 2.2/year to meet the AUKUS target.\nInnovations.\nThe \"Virginia\" class incorporates several innovations not found in previous US submarine classes.\nTechnology barriers.\nBecause of the low rate of \"Virginia\" production, the Navy entered into a program with DARPA to overcome technology barriers to lower the cost of attack submarines so that more could be built, to maintain the size of the fleet.\nThese include:\nUnified Modular Masts.\n\"Virginia\"-class subs are the first class where all masts share common design \u2013 the Universal Modular Mast (UMM) \u2013 designed by L3 KEO (previously Kollmorgen). Shared components have been maximized and some design choices are also shared between different masts. The first UMM was installed on , a \"Los Angeles\"-class submarine. The UMM is an integrated system for housing, erecting, and supporting submarine mast-mounted antennas and sensors. The UMMs are the following:\nPhotonics masts.\nThe \"Virginia\" class is the first to utilize photonic sensors instead of a traditional periscope. The class is equipped with high-resolution cameras, along with light-intensification and infrared sensors, an infrared laser rangefinder, and an integrated Electronic Support Measures (ESM) array. Two redundant sets of these sensors are mounted on two AN/BVS-1 photonics masts located outside the pressure hull. Signals from the masts' sensors are transmitted through optical fiber data lines through signal processors to the control center. Visual feeds from the masts are displayed on liquid-crystal display interfaces in the command center.\nThe design of earlier optical periscopes required them to penetrate the pressure hull, reducing the structural integrity of the pressure hull as well as increasing the risk of flooding, and also required the submarine's control room to be located directly below the sail/fin. Implementation of photonics masts (which do not penetrate the pressure hull) enabled the submarine control room to be relocated to a position inside the pressure hull which is not necessarily directly below the sail.\nThe current photonics masts have a visual appearance so different from ordinary periscopes that when the submarine is detected, it can be distinctly identified as a \"Virginia\"-class vessel. As a result, current photonic masts will be replaced with Low-Profile Photonics Masts (LPPM) which resemble traditional submarine periscopes more closely.\nIn the future, a non-rotational Affordable Modular Panoramic Photonics Mast may be fitted, enabling the submarine to obtain a simultaneous 360\u00b0 view of the sea surface.\nPropulsor.\nIn contrast to a traditional bladed propeller, the \"Virginia\" class uses pump-jet propulsors by BAE Systems, originally developed for the Royal Navy's s. The propulsor significantly reduces the risks of cavitation, and allows quieter operation.\nImproved sonar systems.\nSonar arrays aboard \"Virginia\"-class submarines have an \"Open System Architecture\" (OSA) which enables rapid insertion of new hardware and software as they become available. Hardware upgrades (dubbed Technology Insertions) are usually carried out every four years, while software updates (dubbed Advanced Processor Builds) are carried out every two years. \"Virginia\"-class submarines feature several types of sonar arrays.\n\"Virginia\"-class submarines are also equipped with a low frequency towed sonar array and a high frequency towed sonar array.\nVirginia Payload Module.\nThe Block III submarines have two multipurpose Virginia Payload Tubes (VPT) replacing the dozen single purpose cruise missile launch tubes.\nThe Block V submarines built from 2019 onward will have an additional Virginia Payload Module (VPM) mid-body section, increasing their overall length. The VPM will add four more VPTs of the same diameter and greater height, located on the centerline, carrying up to seven Tomahawk missiles apiece, that would replace some of the capabilities lost when the SSGN conversion s are retired from the fleet. Initially eight payload tubes/silos were planned but this was later rejected in favor of four tubes installed in a long module between the operations compartment and the propulsion spaces.\nThe VPM could potentially carry (non-nuclear) medium-range ballistic missiles. Adding the VPM would increase the cost of each submarine by $500\u00a0million (2012 prices). This additional cost would be offset by reducing the total submarine force by four boats. More recent reports state that as a cost reduction measure the VPM would carry only Tomahawk SLCM and possibly unmanned undersea vehicles (UUV) with the new price tag now estimated at $360\u2013380\u00a0million per boat (in 2010 prices). The VPM launch tubes/silos will reportedly be similar in design to the ones planned for the \"Ohio\" class replacement. In July 2016 General Dynamics was awarded $19\u00a0million for VPM development. In February 2017 General Dynamics was awarded $126\u00a0million for long lead time construction of Block V submarines equipped with VPM.\nThe VPM was designed by General Dynamics Electric Boat; however, manufacturing is undertaken by BWX Technologies and BAE Systems.\nHigh-energy laser weapon.\nAccording to open-source budget documents, \"Virginia\"-class submarines are planned to be equipped with a high-energy laser weapon likely to be incorporated into the photonics mast and have a power output of 300\u2013500 kilowatts, based on the submarine's 30 megawatts reactor capacity.\nBlocks.\nBlock I.\nBlock I includes 4 boats and modular construction techniques were incorporated during construction. Earlier submarines (e.g., \"Los Angeles\"-class SSNs) were built by assembling the pressure hull and then installing the equipment via cavities in the pressure hull. This required extensive construction activities within the narrow confines of the pressure hull which was time-consuming and dangerous. Modular construction was implemented in an effort to overcome these problems and make the construction process more efficient. Modular construction techniques incorporated during construction include constructing large segments of equipment outside the hull. These segments (dubbed rafts) are then inserted into a hull section (a large segment of the pressure hull). The integrated raft and hull section form a module which, when joined with other modules, forms a \"Virginia\"-class submarine. Block I boats were built in 10 modules with each submarine requiring roughly 7 years (84 months) to build.\nBlock II.\nBlock II comprised 6 boats; they were built in four sections rather than ten, saving about $300\u00a0million per boat. Block II boats (except the \"New Hampshire\") were also built under a multi-year procurement agreement as opposed to a block-buy contract in Block I, enabling savings in the range of $400\u00a0million ($80\u00a0million per boat). As a result of improvements in the construction process, \"New Hampshire\" (SSN-778) was US$500\u00a0million cheaper, required 3.7\u00a0million fewer labor hours to build (25% less), thus shortening the construction period by 15 months (20% less) compared to \"Virginia\".\nBlock III.\nConstruction of Block III, through SSN-791 (8 boats), began in 2009. Block III subs feature a revised bow with a Large Aperture Bow (LAB) sonar array, as well as technology from \"Ohio\"-class SSGNs (2 VLS tubes each containing 6 missiles). The horseshoe-shaped LAB sonar array replaces the spherical main sonar array which has been used on all U.S. Navy SSNs since 1960. The LAB sonar array is water-backed\u2014as opposed to earlier sonar arrays which were air-backed\u2014and consists of a passive array and a medium-frequency active array. Compared to earlier \"Virginia\"-class submarines about 40% of the bow has been redesigned.\n\"South Dakota\" (SSN-790) will be equipped with a new propulsor, possibly the Hybrid Multi-Material Rotor (HMMR), developed by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The Hybrid Multi-Material Rotor program is an attempt to improve the design and manufacturing process of submarine propellers with an aim of reducing the cost and weight of the propeller/rotor as well as improving overall acoustic performance.\nBlock IV.\nBlock IV consists of ten submarines. The 2013 budget sequestration put this ten-submarine in doubt by budget sequestration that same year. The most costly shipbuilding contract in history, worth $17.6\u00a0billion, was awarded on 28 April 2014 to General Dynamics Electric Boat. The main improvement over the Block III is the reduction of major maintenance periods from four to three, increasing each boat's total lifetime deployments by one.\nThe long-lead-time materials contract for SSN-792 was awarded on 17 April 2012, with SSN-793 and SSN-794 following on 28 December 2012. The U.S. Navy has awarded General Dynamics Electric Boat a $208.6\u00a0million contract modification for the second fiscal year (FY) 14 \"Virginia\"-class submarine, SSN-793, and two FY 15 submarines, SSN-794 and SSN-795. With this modification, the overall contract is worth $595\u00a0million.\nBlock V.\nBlock V has twelve boats and may incorporate the Virginia Payload Module (VPM), which would give guided-missile capability when the SSGNs are retired from service. The Virginia Payload Module will be included on Block V submarines starting with the second boat, SSN-803. The Block V boats with VPM are expected to triple the capacity of shore targets for each boat. Construction on the first two boats of this block was expected to begin in 2019 but was pushed back to 2020, with contracts for long lead time material for SSN-802 and SSN-803 being awarded to General Dynamics Electric Boat. HII Newport News Shipbuilding was awarded a long-lead materials contract for two Block V boats in 2017, the first Block Vs for the company.\nOn 2 December 2019, the Navy announced an order for nine new \"Virginia\"-class submarines\u2014eight Block Vs and one Block IV\u2014for a total contract price of $22\u00a0billion with an option for a tenth boat. The Block V subs were confirmed to have an increased length, from 377\u00a0ft (115 m) to 460\u00a0ft (140 m), and displacement, from 7,800 tons to 10,200 tons. This would make the Block V the second-longest US submarine, behind only the s (at 560\u00a0ft; 170 m).\nOn 22 March 2021, the U.S. Navy added the tenth boat of the Block V series of the \"Virginia\"-class attack submarine, issuing a $2.4\u00a0billion adjustment on the December 2019 contract. This brings the total cost of the contract with prime contractor General Dynamics Electric Boat to $24.1\u00a0billion. The net increase for the contract is $1.89\u00a0billion, according to a General Dynamics release. Huntington Ingalls Industries' Newport News Shipbuilding is the partner yard in the program.\nBlock VI.\nFor the Fiscal Year 2025, the Navy announced procurement of three Block VI boats, with plans to eventually acquire nine to ten boats in total. The Navy awarded General Dynamics Electric Boat a $1.3 billion long lead materials contract for the first Block VI Virginia-class boats, with a future multi-year contract between the submarine yard and the Navy expected. The Block VIs will be the second set of \"Virginia\"-class attack submarines to feature the Virginia Payload Module, which will meet the Navy's requirement for a large-scale land strike missile platform after the four guided-missile submarines are decommissioned by 2030. Block VI boats will feature six 84-foot wide Multiple All-up-round Canister (MAC) VPMs, four in the middle of the submarine and two on the bow, with each VPM holding seven TLAMs, this will give the Block VI a total capacity of over forty Tomahawk Cruise Missiles. The Navy is also planning to equip its attack submarines, including some of the Block VI's VPMs, with the new Conventional Prompt Strike hypersonic missile system starting in 2028. The Navy has said it would need twenty VPM boats to make up for the strike missile loss when the Ohios retire. Design improvements on the Block VI include improvements in stealth, propulsion, weapons and specialized technology for interacting with the water column from the surface to the seabed, allowing the Block VI to perform land strike missions, anti-submarine and surface ship warfare, special operations support, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Block VI boats will also be equipped with a special type of drone that can be deployed from the submarine, connected by a strong fiber optic cable, and interface with military communications networks, allowing the submarine to share data gathered by their sonar and other acoustic systems with air, surface, and land communications nodes. At least one Block VI boat is expected to be a specialized seabed warfare variant, specially designed for undersea espionage and other special missions such as deploying special operations teams, and would eventually replace the . In January 2025, it was announced the first three Block VI boats would be named , and ; the contract to build \"Potomac\" is expected to be issued in FY2026 with delivery and commissioning in 2034 or 2035.\nBoats in class.\nFuture acquisitions.\nThe Navy initially planned to acquire at least 30 \"Virginia\"-class submarines, however, more recent data provided by the Naval Submarine League (in 2011) and the Congressional Budget Office (in 2012) seems to imply that more than 30 submarines may eventually be built. The Naval Submarine League believes that up to 10\u00a0Block\u00a0V boats will be built. The same source also states that 10 additional submarines could be built after Block\u00a0V submarines, with 5 in the so-called Block\u00a0VI and 5 in Block\u00a0VII, largely due to the delays experienced with the \"Improved \"Virginia\"\". These 20\u00a0submarines (10\u00a0Block\u00a0V, 5\u00a0Block\u00a0VI, 5\u00a0Block\u00a0VII) would carry VPM bringing the total number of \"Virginia\"-class submarines to 48 (including the 28\u00a0submarines in Blocks I, II, III and IV). The CBO in its 2012 report states that 33\u00a0\"Virginia\"-class submarines will be procured in the 2013\u20132032 timeframe, resulting in 49\u00a0submarines in total since 16 were already procured by the end of 2012. Such a long production run seems unlikely but another naval program, the , is still ongoing even though the first vessel was ordered in 1985. However, other sources believe that production will end with Block\u00a0V. In addition, data provided in CBO reports tends to vary considerably compared to earlier editions.\nOne Block VI submarine will include an organic ability to employ seabed warfare equipment.\nGeneral Dynamics Electric Boat, a business unit of General Dynamics, announced on 5 August 2024 it has been awarded a $1.3 billion undefinitized contract modification allowing Electric Boat to purchase long lead time materials for \"Virginia\"-class Block VI submarines.\nDuring the Naval Submarine League's annual symposium on 13 November 2024, plans for extending the \"Virginia\"-class to Block VIII - due to SSN(X) delays - were voiced.\nSSN(X)/Improved \"Virginia\".\nInitially dubbed Future Attack Submarine and Improved \"Virginia\" class in early Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reports, the SSN(X) will instead be a largely new design that initially supplements and eventually replaces the \"Virginia\" class submarines.\nIn late 2014, the US Navy began early preparation work on the SSN(X). It was planned that the first submarine would be procured in 2025. However, their introduction (i.e., procurement of the first submarine) has been pushed back to 2033/2034. The long-range shipbuilding plan is for the new SSN to be authorized in 2034, and become operational by 2044 after the last Block VII \"Virginia\" is built. Roughly a decade would be spent identifying, designing, and demonstrating new technologies before an analysis of alternatives is issued in 2024. An initial small team has been formed to consult with industry and identify the threat environment and technologies the submarine will need to operate against in the 2050-plus timeframe.\nIn 2019, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the SSN(X) boats could cost up to $5.5\u00a0billion per hull. The current \"Virginia\"-class boats cost about $2.8\u00a0billion per hull, while the Block V boats with the 80-foot Virginia Payload Module will cost about $3.2\u00a0billion. \"The Navy indicates that the next-generation attack submarine should be faster, stealthier, and able to carry more torpedoes than the \"Virginia\"-class, similar to the \"Seawolf\"-class submarine. CBO therefore assumed that the SSN(X) would be a \"Seawolf\"-sized SSN, which displaces about 9,100 tons when submerged, and would have an all-new design in keeping with the Navy's description of it as a fast, lethal next-generation attack submarine\", the CBO wrote.\nPotential exports.\nOn 16 September 2021, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that Australia had canceled its contract with French shipbuilder Naval Group for 12 diesel-electric submarines based on the French nuclear submarine that were to replace Australia's diesel-electric s. The AUKUS trilateral security partnership between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, was announced the same day. Under the pact, the US will share nuclear propulsion technology with Australia the same as it has with the UK since 1958, as will the UK. The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) would acquire at least eight nuclear-powered submarines armed with conventional weapons with basic design and key technologies decided by an 18-month research project. On 22 November 2021, Australia, the UK and the US signed the \"Exchange of Naval Nuclear Propulsion Information Agreement\" (ENNPIA) treaty to share classified information about nuclear propulsion.\nOn 13 March 2023, AUKUS announced that \"in the early 2030s, pending Congressional approval, the United States intends to sell Australia three \"Virginia\"-class submarines, with the potential to sell up to two more if needed\". These submarines will ensure there is no capability gap between when the \"Collins\"-class is retired and the introduction of a new class of nuclear-powered submarines, the SSN-AUKUS. AUKUS also announced on the same day that the UK's SSNR submarine design will be renamed SSN-AUKUS and be trilaterally developed and built in the UK and in Australia. The SSN-AUKUS class \"will have a high degree of commonality\" with the \"Virginia\"-class, including \"sharing elements of the propulsion plant, combat system and weapons\".\nThe first in-service United States Navy Block IV \"Virginia\"-class boat is planned to be sold to the RAN in 2032 and the second in-service Block IV in 2035. The third boat to be sold to the RAN, in 2038, will be a new Block VII without the Virginia Payload Module. The first boat of the SSN-AUKUS class for the RAN is planned to be delivered in the early 2040s; five boats are planned to be built, with a boat built every three years. If the SSN-AUKUS build schedule falls behind, the RAN has the option of purchasing up to two additional \"Virginia\"-class boats.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was first released for the North American market in October 1982 and then Europe and Japan in 1983. Originally produced by General Consumer Electronics, it was later licensed to Milton Bradley after they acquired the company. Bandai released the system in Japan under the name \u5149\u901f\u8239, meaning Lightspeed.\nThe Vectrex, in contrast to other video game systems at the time, did not need to be hooked up to a television set; it had an integrated (vertically oriented) monochrome CRT monitor. A detachable wired control pad could be folded into the lower base of the console. Games came with translucent color overlays to place over the screen. Optional peripherals include a pair of 3D goggles known as the \"3D Imager\" and a light pen for drawing directly on the screen. The \"Asteroids\"-inspired \"Mine Storm\" was built into the system.\nThe console was conceived by John Ross, of Smith Engineering, in late 1980 as a handheld called the \"Mini Arcade\". As development progressed, it morphed into a tabletop system that was manufactured by General Consumer Electronics. Strong initial sales caused General Consumer Electronics to be acquired by Milton Bradley. However, sales of the Vectrex soon stalled amid the video game crash of 1983, and the system was discontinued in early 1984.\nDespite its commercial failure, the Vectrex was praised for its software library, unique graphical capabilities, and built-in monitor. Several publications lauded it as one of the best consoles available at the time. The Vectrex was the first console to have a 3D-based peripheral. A color handheld version of the Vectrex was conceived in the late 1980s, but was shelved because of its manufacturing cost and the success of the Nintendo Game Boy.\nHistory.\nThe Vectrex was conceived by John Ross of Smith Engineering. He, Mike Purvis, Tom Sloper, and Steve Marking had gone to Electro-Mavin, a surplus warehouse in Los Angeles. They found a 1-inch cathode-ray tube (CRT) and wondered if a small electronic game could be made of it. A demonstration of a vector-drawing cathode-ray tube display was made by connecting the deflection yoke in a standard television to the channels of a stereo amplifier fed with music program material. An auxiliary yoke was used to keep the raster television's horizontal fly-back high-voltage system running. The demo led to a system originally conceived as a handheld called the Mini Arcade but, as Smith Engineering shopped the idea around to developers, it evolved into a tabletop with nine-inch screen.\nThe system was licensed to General Consumer Electronics in 1981. After a brief hardware and software development period, the Vectrex was unveiled on 7 June 1982 at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago. It was publicly released in seven select introductory markets in October at a retail price of US$199 before being distributed nationally in the first quarter of 1983. The launch sales were strong enough that Milton Bradley bought out General Consumer Electronics in early 1983.\nMilton Bradley's greater resources allowed the Vectrex to be released in parts of Europe by mid-1983 and, through a co-branding agreement with Bandai, in Japan as well. However, the North American video game crash of 1983 turned Milton Bradley's support of the Vectrex into a costly mistake, even despite reducing its price by 25% and then later 50% in desperation to sell units. In February 1984, after losing $31.6 million on the Vectrex, Milton Bradley announced the discontinuation of the console and cancelled development of new games. The company's entire inventory of consoles and accessories was sold off to mass-market discount houses, where they were liquidated at a fraction of the console's introductory price. By May 1984, Milton Bradley merged with Hasbro and after-market support ended.\nPrior to the Vectrex's discontinuation, a successor console with a color screen had been planned. After the rights reverted to Smith Engineering, the company made plans to revive the Vectrex as a handheld, but the imminent arrival of Nintendo's Game Boy put an end to those plans. In the mid-1990s, Jay Smith, then head of Smith Engineering, allowed new hardware and software development on a fee- and royalty-free basis. Smith has also allowed duplication of the original Vectrex software on a not-for-profit basis to allow Vectrex owners to obtain the original titles at low cost or for free.\nDesign and technical specifications.\nThe Vectrex's CPU is a Motorola 68A09 clocked at 1.5\u00a0MHz, with 1\u00a0KB of RAM (two 4-bit 2114 chips) and 8\u00a0KB ROM (one 8-bit 2363 chip). It also uses a MOS Technology 6522 versatile interface adapter (VIA). Games are stored on ROM cartridges that are 32\u00a0KB in size. Controller inputs and audio are provided by a General Instrument AY-3-8912 sound chip. Sound is played through a 3-inch electrodynamic paper cone speaker.\nThe computer and vector generator were designed by Gerry Karr. The computer runs the game's computer code, watches the user's inputs, runs the sound generator, and controls the vector generator to make the screen drawings. The vector generator is an all-analog design using two integrators: X and Y. The computer sets the integration rates using a digital-to-analog converter. The computer controls the integration time by momentarily closing electronic analog switches within the operational-amplifier based integrator circuits. Voltage ramps are produced that the monitor uses to steer the electron beam over the face of the phosphor screen of the cathode-ray tube. Another signal is generated that controls the brightness of the line.\nThe cathode-ray tube is a Samsung model 240RB40 monochrome unit measuring 9 \u00d7 11\u00a0inches, displaying a picture of 240\u00a0mm diagonal; it is an off-the-shelf picture tube manufactured for small black/white television sets. The brightness of the CRT is controlled using a circular knob on the back of the display. A vector CRT display such as the one in the Vectrex does not require a special tube, and differs from standard raster-based television sets only in the control circuits. Rather than use sawtooth waves to direct the internal electron beam in a raster pattern, computer-controlled integrators feed linear amplifiers to drive the deflection yoke. This yoke has similar, if not identical inductances, unlike a TV deflection yoke. The yoke uses a standard TV core. The high-voltage transformer also uses a standard core and bobbin. There is special circuitry to turn off the electron beam if the vector generator stops or fails. This prevents burning of the screen's phosphors. This design is a great deal smaller than the electronics found in the free-standing, full-sized \"Asteroids\" arcade machine.\nDuring development, the possibility of using the MOS Technology 6502 processor was considered, but later its performance was considered insufficient.\nEarly units have a very audible \"buzzing\" from the built-in speaker that reacts to the graphics generated on screen. This is due to improper production grounding of signal lines of the low-level audio circuitry, and was eventually resolved in later production models. A \"ground loop\" had been created by a grounding strap added in production to meet U.S. Federal Communications Commission signal radiation requirements. This idiosyncrasy has become a familiar characteristic of the machine.\nPeripherals.\n3-D Imager.\nThe 3-D Imager, invented by John Ross, turns the 2-D black-and-white images drawn by the Vectrex into a color 3-D experience. The imager works by spinning a disk in front of the viewer's eyes. The disk is black for 180 degrees and in some cases has 60 degree wedges of transparent red, green, and blue filters. The user looks through this to the Vectrex screen. The Vectrex synchronizes the rotation of the disk to the software frame rate as it draws 6 screens: with the right eye covered: the left eye red image, then green, and then the blue image is drawn, and then, while the left eye is covered by the black 180-degree sector: the right eye red, green, and then the blue image is drawn. Only one eye will see the Vectrex screen and its 3 associated images (or colors) at any one time while the other will be blocked by the 180-degree mask. The prototype was made in the plastic casework of a Viewmaster. The disc spins freely and is driven by a motor. The Vectrex software generates its own frame-rate and compares it to an index signal from the glasses once per revolution. Score is kept of how many wheel rotations are early compared to the software frame rate, and how many are late. The software tries to keep these two trends equal by adjusting the power being delivered to the motor that spins the filter and mask wheel. Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is used to control the motor speed: the ratio of the \"on\" time versus the \"off\" time of a rapid stream of power pulses to the motor. In this way the software synchronizes the rotation of the wheel to the software's frame rate, or drawing time, for the combined and repeating group of up to 6 evolving images.\nA single object that does not lie on the plane of the monitor (\"i.e.\", in front of or into the monitor) is drawn at least twice to provide information for each eye. The distance between the duplicate images and the angles from which they are drawn will determine where the object will appear to \"be\" in 3-D space. The 3-D illusion is also enhanced by adjusting the brightness of the object (dimming objects in the background). Spinning the disk at a high enough speed will fool the viewer's eyes/brain into thinking that the multiple images it is seeing are two different views of the same object due to the persistence of vision. This creates the impression of 3-D and color.\nThe same 3-D effect is in fact possible with raster or film-projection images, and the shutter glasses used in some 3-D theaters and virtual reality theme park rides work on the same principle.\nLight pen.\nThe light pen allows the user to \"draw\", to create images and to indicate, on the screen. It has a photo-detector that can see the bright spot of the vector-drawing display monitor when it goes by under the light pen's position where it is being held to the screen. The photo-detector feeds internal pulse-catching circuits that tell the Vectrex and its software of the event. The prototype was made in the plastic casework of a Marks-A-Lot felt-tipped marker pen. The Vectrex draws a spider-web-like search-pattern to track the pen's location. The software changes the pattern size as the pen changes motions and velocity in an attempt keep a continuous lock on the pen's position. The Vectrex light pen was invented by John Ross.\nScreen overlays.\nIn order to enhance the display visuals of the Vectrex, every commercially released game included its own unique translucent plastic screen overlay that accompanied the cartridge (a concept first seen with the Magnavox Odyssey, as well as some early arcade machines). Instead of physically touching the CRT screen, four tabs on the Vectrex console securely held them in place in front of it, with a small gap between the actual screen and the overlay. Made up of one to three colors for the play field area, these overlays simulate simple color graphics (on an otherwise black and white screen), helped reduced glare, flicker and gave the appearance of a flat screen. They also allowed changes in brightness intensity of vector graphics to be more visually distinctive. In some cases game designers created pseudo color cycling effects, for a sense of movement, by using alternating colored patterns. In addition to players' score areas, some overlays also contained additional artwork and patterns, to add to the game's play field. Across the bottom of each overlay are game-specific joystick and button functions as a guide for the player. Each overlay also displayed the title and logo of each game, along with a colored border or design, to add cosmetic flair to the Vectrex (much like an arcade machine with its marquee or side art). Overlays were not required, but added to the experience in terms of the visual look of game graphics and the overall display appearance of the console.\nSoftware.\nSome of the Vectrex's library consisted of ports of arcade hits, most of them brought to the console through a licensing deal with Cinematronics.\nThe liquor company Old Mr. Boston gave out a limited number of customized \"Clean Sweep\" cartridges, with a Mr. Boston sticker on the box. The overlay was the regular \"Clean Sweep\" overlay with the Mr. Boston name, logo, and copyright info running up either side. The game itself had custom text, and the player controlled a top hat rather than a vacuum. \"Clean Sweep\" was written by Richard Moszkowski.\nReception.\n\"Byte\" in 1982 called Vectrex \"one of the greatest game machines we have seen this year ... [Vectrex] is a good bet to score big with the consumer\". The magazine praised the screen, stating that \"it almost has to be seen to be believed; imagine playing games at home (or in the office) using vector graphics with three-dimensional rotation and zoom\", and noted that \"It is unusual and refreshing to see a product appearing on the market with its software ready to run\". David H. Ahl stated in \"Creative Computing Video &amp; Arcade Games\" in 1983 that \"Vector graphics really do make a difference, and the strong line-up of games helps immensely\".\nLegacy.\nSince late 1995, there has been a Usenet community of hobbyists writing games for ParaJVE, a Vectrex emulator. Its emulation is also a compound of MESS (included in MAME, so RetroArch too via libretro), DVE, lr-vex, Vecx, with a Wii version called VectrexWii. Schematics for a \"Vectrex Multicart\" cartridge is available, allowing several games to be packed on one cartridge. There are also several people manufacturing and selling newly made games, some complete as cartridges with packing and overlays in the style of the original commercially released games, others with varying degrees of packaging.\nNew hardware has also been developed for the Vectrex in recent years, including a light pen that addressed the limitation of the original version by including buttons that replace the second controller required on the original version, and a daughterboard that addresses the well-known buzz in the system's audio (bypassing the original audio circuitry on the power board in favor of a module installed elsewhere within the cabinet).\nRebirth.\nOn May 21, 2025, https://, the official handle of Vectrex on X (formerly Twitter), uploaded a post showcasing a new logo designed by David \"Papi Geek\" Oghia using Adobe Illustrator. Then, on July 8, Oghia launched a new project called the \"Vectrex Mini,\" and began discussing it on the \"Vectrex fans unite!\" Facebook group. He would go on to present the unit at Gamescom in Cologne, Germany, which took place between August 20 and 24. The Vectrex Mini, while being approximately half the size of the original Vectrex, is criticized for its 5-inch AMOLED screen, which is unable to faithfully produce vector graphics unlike the original's CRT display. Nevertheless, the Mini garnered positive reception at Gamescom.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is designed to support time-sharing, batch processing, transaction processing and workstation applications. Customers using OpenVMS include banks and financial services, hospitals and healthcare, telecommunications operators, network information services, and industrial manufacturers. During the 1990s and 2000s, there were approximately half a million VMS systems in operation worldwide.\nIt was first announced by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) as VAX/VMS (\"Virtual Address eXtension/Virtual Memory System\") alongside the VAX-11/780 minicomputer in 1977. OpenVMS has subsequently been ported to run on DEC Alpha systems, the Itanium-based HPE Integrity Servers, and select x86-64 hardware and hypervisors. Since 2014, OpenVMS is developed and supported by VMS Software Inc. (VSI). OpenVMS offers high availability through clustering\u2014the ability to distribute the system over multiple physical machines. This allows clustered applications and data to remain continuously available while operating system software and hardware maintenance and upgrades are performed, or if part of the cluster is destroyed. VMS cluster uptimes of 17 years have been reported.\nHistory.\nOrigin and name changes.\nIn April 1975, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) embarked on a project to design a 32-bit extension to its PDP-11 computer line. The hardware component was code named \"Star\"; the operating system was code named \"Starlet\". Roger Gourd was the project lead for VMS. Software engineers Dave Cutler, Dick Hustvedt, and Peter Lipman acted as technical project leaders. To avoid a repetition of PDP-11's many incompatible operating systems, the new operating system would be capable of real-time, time-sharing, and transaction processing. The Star and Starlet projects culminated in the VAX-11/780 computer and the VAX/VMS operating system. The Starlet project's code name survives in VMS in the name of several of the system libraries, including codice_1 and codice_2. VMS was mostly written in VAX MACRO with some components written in BLISS.\nOne of the original goals for VMS was backward compatibility with DEC's existing RSX-11M operating system. Prior to the V4.0 release, VAX/VMS included a compatibility layer named the \"RSX Application Migration Executive\" (RSX AME), which allowed user-mode RSX-11M software to be run unmodified on top of VMS. The RSX AME played an important role on early versions of VAX/VMS, which used certain RSX-11M user-mode utilities before native VAX versions had been developed. By the V3.0 release, all compatibility-mode utilities were replaced with native implementations. In VAX/VMS V4.0, RSX AME was removed from the base system, and replaced with an optional layered product named \"VAX-11 RSX\".\nBy the early 1980s VAX/VMS was very successful in the market. Although created on Unix on DEC systems, Ingres ported to VMS believing that doing so was necessary for commercial success. Demand for the VMS version was so much greater that the company neglected the Unix version. A number of distributions of VAX/VMS were created:\nWith the V5.0 release in April 1988, DEC began to refer to VAX/VMS as simply VMS in its documentation. In July 1992, DEC renamed VAX/VMS to OpenVMS as an indication of its support of open systems industry standards such as POSIX and Unix compatibility, and to drop the VAX connection since a migration to a different architecture was underway. The OpenVMS name was first used with the OpenVMS AXP V1.0 release in November 1992. DEC began using the OpenVMS VAX name with the V6.0 release in June 1993.\nPort to Alpha.\nDuring the 1980s, DEC planned to replace the VAX platform and the VMS operating system with the PRISM architecture and the MICA operating system. When these projects were cancelled in 1988, a team was set up to design new VAX/VMS systems of comparable performance to RISC-based Unix systems. After a number of failed attempts to design a faster VAX-compatible processor, the group demonstrated the feasibility of porting VMS and its applications to a RISC architecture based on PRISM. This led to the creation of the Alpha architecture. The project to port VMS to Alpha began in 1989, and first booted on a prototype Alpha EV3-based \"Alpha Demonstration Unit\" in early 1991.\nThe main challenge in porting VMS to a new architecture was that VMS and the VAX were designed together, meaning that VMS was dependent on certain details of the VAX architecture. Furthermore, a significant amount of the VMS kernel, layered products, and customer-developed applications were implemented in VAX MACRO assembly code. Some of the changes needed to decouple VMS from the VAX architecture included the creation of the \"MACRO-32\" compiler, which treated VAX MACRO as a high-level language, and compiled it to Alpha object code, and the emulation of certain low-level details of the VAX architecture in PALcode, such as interrupt handling and atomic queue instructions.\nThe VMS port to Alpha resulted in the creation of two separate codebases: one for VAX, and another for Alpha. The Alpha code library was based on a snapshot of the VAX/VMS code base circa V5.4-2. 1992 saw the release of the first version of OpenVMS for Alpha AXP systems, designated \"OpenVMS AXP V1.0\". In 1994, with the release of OpenVMS V6.1, feature (and version number) parity between the VAX and Alpha variants was achieved; this was the so-called Functional Equivalence release. The decision to use the 1.x version numbering stream for the pre-production quality releases of OpenVMS AXP confused some customers, and was not repeated in the subsequent ports of OpenVMS to new platforms.\nWhen VMS was ported to Alpha, it was initially left as a 32-bit only operating system. This was done to ensure backwards compatibility with software written for the 32-bit VAX. 64-bit addressing was first added for Alpha in the V7.0 release. In order to allow 64-bit code to interoperate with older 32-bit code, OpenVMS does not create a distinction between 32-bit and 64-bit executables, but instead allows for both 32-bit and 64-bit pointers to be used within the same code. This is known as mixed pointer support. The 64-bit OpenVMS Alpha releases support a maximum virtual address space size of 8TiB (a 43-bit address space), which is the maximum supported by the Alpha 21064 and Alpha 21164.\nOne of the more noteworthy Alpha-only features of OpenVMS was \"OpenVMS Galaxy\", which allowed the partitioning of a single SMP server to run multiple instances of OpenVMS. Galaxy supported dynamic resource allocation to running partitions, and the ability to share memory between partitions.\nPort to Intel Itanium.\nIn 2001, prior to its acquisition by Hewlett-Packard, Compaq announced the port of OpenVMS to the Intel Itanium architecture. The Itanium port was the result of Compaq's decision to discontinue future development of the Alpha architecture in favour of adopting the then-new Itanium architecture. The porting began in late 2001, and the first boot on took place on January 31, 2003. The first boot consisted of booting a minimal system configuration on a HP i2000 workstation, logging in as the codice_3 user, and running the codice_4 command. The Itanium port of OpenVMS supports specific models and configurations of HPE Integrity Servers. The Itanium releases were originally named \"HP OpenVMS Industry Standard 64 for Integrity Servers\", although the names \"OpenVMS I64\" or \"OpenVMS for Integrity Servers\" are more commonly used.\nThe Itanium port was accomplished using source code maintained in common within the OpenVMS Alpha source code library, with the addition of conditional code and additional modules where changes specific to Itanium were required. This required certain architectural dependencies of OpenVMS to be replaced, or emulated in software. Some of the changes included using the Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) to boot the operating system, reimplementing the functionality previously provided by Alpha PALcode inside the kernel, using new executable file formats (Executable and Linkable Format and DWARF), and adopting IEEE 754 as the default floating point format.\nAs with the VAX to Alpha port, a binary translator for Alpha to Itanium was made available, allowing user-mode OpenVMS Alpha software to be ported to Itanium in situations where it was not possible to recompile the source code. This translator is known as the \"Alpha Environment Software Translator\" (AEST), and it also supported translating VAX executables which had already been translated with VEST.\nTwo pre-production releases, OpenVMS I64 V8.0 and V8.1, were available on June 30, 2003, and on December 18, 2003. These releases were intended for HP organizations and third-party vendors involved with porting software packages to OpenVMS I64. The first production release, V8.2, was released in February 2005. V8.2 was also released for Alpha; subsequent V8.x releases of OpenVMS have maintained feature parity between the Alpha and Itanium architectures.\nPort to x86-64.\nWhen VMS Software Inc. (VSI) announced that they had secured the rights to develop the OpenVMS operating system from HP, they also announced their intention to port OpenVMS to the x86-64 architecture. The porting effort ran concurrently with the establishment of the company, as well as the development of VSI's own Itanium and Alpha releases of OpenVMS V8.4-x.\nThe x86-64 port is targeted for specific servers from HPE and Dell, as well as certain virtual machine hypervisors. Initial support was targeted for KVM and VirtualBox. Support for VMware was announced in 2020, and Hyper-V is being explored as a future target. In 2021, the x86-64 port was demonstrated running on an Intel Atom-based single-board computer.\nAs with the Alpha and Itanium ports, the x86-64 port made some changes to simplify porting and supporting OpenVMS on the new platform including: replacing the proprietary GEM compiler backend used by the VMS compilers with LLVM, changing the boot process so that OpenVMS is booted from a memory disk, and simulating the four privilege levels of OpenVMS in software since only two of x86-64's privilege levels are usable by OpenVMS.\nThe first boot was announced on May 14, 2019. This involved booting OpenVMS on VirtualBox, and successfully running the codice_4 command. In May 2020, the V9.0 Early Adopter's Kit release was made available to a small number of customers. This consisted of the OpenVMS operating system running in a VirtualBox VM with certain limitations; most significantly, few layered products were available, and code can only be compiled for x86-64 using cross compilers which run on Itanium-based OpenVMS systems. Following the V9.0 release, VSI released a series of updates on a monthly or bimonthly basis which added additional functionality and hypervisor support. These were designated V9.0-A through V9.0-H. In June 2021, VSI released the V9.1 Field Test, making it available to VSI's customers and partners. V9.1 shipped as an ISO image which can be installed onto a variety of hypervisors, and onto HPE ProLiant DL380 servers starting with the V9.1-A release.\nInfluence.\nDuring the 1980s, the MICA operating system for the PRISM architecture was intended to be the eventual successor to VMS. MICA was designed to maintain backwards compatibility with VMS applications while also supporting Ultrix applications on top of the same kernel. MICA was ultimately cancelled along with the rest of the PRISM platform, leading Dave Cutler to leave DEC for Microsoft. At Microsoft, Cutler led the creation of the Windows NT operating system, which was heavily inspired by the architecture of MICA. As a result, VMS is considered an ancestor of Windows NT, together with RSX-11, VAXELN and MICA, and many similarities exist between VMS and NT.\nA now-defunct project named \"FreeVMS\" attempted to develop an open-source operating system following VMS conventions. FreeVMS was built on top of the L4 microkernel and supported the x86-64 architecture. Prior work investigating the implementation of VMS using a microkernel-based architecture had previously been undertaken as a prototyping exercise by DEC employees with assistance from Carnegie Mellon University using the Mach 3.0 microkernel ported to VAXstation 3100 hardware, adopting a multiserver architectural model.\nArchitecture.\nThe OpenVMS operating system has a layered architecture, consisting of a privileged \"Executive\", an intermediately privileged Command Language Interpreter, and unprivileged utilities and run-time libraries (RTLs). Unprivileged code typically invokes the functionality of the Executive through \"system services\" (equivalent to system calls in other operating systems).\nOpenVMS' layers and mechanisms are built around certain features of the VAX architecture, including:\nThese VAX architecture mechanisms are implemented on Alpha, Itanium and x86-64 by either mapping to corresponding hardware mechanisms on those architectures, or through emulation (via PALcode on Alpha, or in software on Itanium and x86-64).\nExecutive and Kernel.\nThe OpenVMS Executive comprises the privileged code and data structures which reside in the system space. The Executive is further subdivided between the \"Kernel\", which consists of the code which runs at the kernel access mode, and the less-privileged code outside of the Kernel which runs at the executive access mode.\nThe components of the Executive which run at executive access mode include the Record Management Services, and certain system services such as image activation. The main distinction between the kernel and executive access modes is that most of the operating system's core data structures can be read from executive mode, but require kernel mode to be written to. Code running at executive mode can switch to kernel mode at will, meaning that the barrier between the kernel and executive modes is intended as a safeguard against accidental corruption as opposed to a security mechanism.\nThe Kernel comprises the operating system's core data structures (e.g. page tables, the I/O database and scheduling data), and the routines which operate on these structures. The Kernel is typically described as having three major subsystems: I/O, Process and Time Management, Memory Management. In addition, other functionality such as logical name management, synchronization and system service dispatch are implemented inside the Kernel.\nOpenVMS allows user-mode code with suitable privileges to switch to executive or kernel mode using the codice_6 and codice_7 system services, respectively. This allows code outside of system space to have direct access to the Executive's routines and system services. In addition to allowing third-party extensions to the operating system, Privileged Images are used by core operating system utilities to manipulate operating system data structures through undocumented interfaces.\nFile system.\nThe typical user and application interface into the file system is the Record Management Services (RMS), although applications can interface directly with the underlying file system through the QIO system services. The file systems supported by VMS are referred to as the Files-11 \"On-Disk Structures\" (ODS), the most significant of which are \"ODS-2\" and \"ODS-5\". VMS is also capable of accessing files on ISO 9660 CD-ROMs and magnetic tape with ANSI tape labels.\nFiles-11 is limited to 2 TiB volumes. DEC attempted to replace it with a log-structured file system named Spiralog, first released in 1995. However, Spiralog was discontinued due to a variety of problems, including issues with handling full volumes. Instead, there has been discussion of porting the open-source GFS2 file system to OpenVMS.\nCommand Language Interpreter.\nAn OpenVMS Command Language Interpreter (CLI) implements a command-line interface for OpenVMS, responsible for executing individual commands and \"command procedures\" (equivalent to shell scripts or batch files). The standard CLI for OpenVMS is the DIGITAL Command Language, although other options are available.\nUnlike Unix shells, which typically run in their own isolated process and behave like any other user-mode program, OpenVMS CLIs are an optional component of a process, which exist alongside any executable image which that process may run. Whereas a Unix shell will typically run executables by creating a separate process using fork-exec, an OpenVMS CLI will typically load the executable image into the same process, transfer control to the image, and ensure that control is transferred back to CLI once the image has exited and that the process is returned to its original state.\nBecause the CLI is loaded into the same address space as user code, and the CLI is responsible for invoking image activation and image rundown, the CLI is mapped into the process address space at supervisor access mode, a higher level of privilege than most user code. This is in order to prevent accidental or malicious manipulation of the CLI's code and data structures by user-mode code.\nFeatures.\nClustering.\nOpenVMS supports clustering (first called \"VAXcluster\" and later \"VMScluster\"), where multiple computers run their own instance of the operating system. Clustered computers (nodes) may be fully independent from each other, or they may share devices like disk drives and printers. Communication across nodes provides a single system image abstraction. Nodes may be connected to each other via a proprietary hardware connection called Cluster Interconnect or via a standard Ethernet LAN.\nOpenVMS supports up to 96 nodes in a single cluster. It also allows mixed-architecture clusters. OpenVMS clusters allow applications to function during planned or unplanned outages. Planned outages include hardware and software upgrades.\nNetworking.\nThe DECnet protocol suite is tightly integrated into VMS, allowing remote logins, as well as transparent access to files, printers and other resources on VMS systems over a network. VAX/VMS V1.0 featured support for DECnet Phase II, and modern versions of VMS support both the traditional Phase IV DECnet protocol, as well as the OSI-compatible Phase V (also known as \"DECnet-Plus\"). Support for TCP/IP is provided by the optional \"TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS\" layered product (originally known as the \"VMS/ULTRIX Connection\", then as the \"ULTRIX Communications Extensions\" or UCX). TCP/IP Services is based on a port of the BSD network stack to OpenVMS, along with support for common protocols such as SSH, DHCP, FTP and SMTP.\nDEC sold a software package named PATHWORKS (originally known as the \"Personal Computer Systems Architecture\" or PCSA) which allowed personal computers running MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows or OS/2, or the Apple Macintosh to serve as a terminal for VMS systems, or to use VMS systems as a file or print server. PATHWORKS was later renamed to \"Advanced Server for OpenVMS\", and was eventually replaced with a VMS port of Samba at the time of the Itanium port.\nDEC provided the Local Area Transport (LAT) protocol which allowed remote terminals and printers to be attached to a VMS system through a terminal server such as one of the DECserver family.\nProgramming.\nDEC (and its successor companies) provided a wide variety of programming languages for VMS. Officially supported languages on VMS, either current or historical, include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAmong OpenVMS's notable features is the \"Common Language Environment\", a strictly defined standard that specifies calling conventions for functions and routines, including use of stacks, registers, etc., independent of programming language. Because of this, it is possible to call a routine written in one language (for example, Fortran) from another (for example, COBOL), without needing to know the implementation details of the target language. OpenVMS itself is implemented in a variety of different languages and the common language environment and calling standard supports freely mixing these languages. DEC created a tool named the \"Structure Definition Language\" (SDL), which allowed data type definitions to be generated for different languages from a common definition.\nThe set of languages available directly with the operating system is restricted to C, Fortran, Pascal, BASIC, C++, BLISS and COBOL. Freely available open source languages include Lua, PHP, Python, Scala and Java.\nDevelopment tools.\nDEC provided a collection of software development tools in a layered product named \"DECset\" (originally named \"VAXset\"). This consisted of the following tools:\nThe OpenVMS Debugger supports all DEC compilers and many third-party languages. It allows breakpoints, watchpoints and interactive runtime program debugging using either a command line or graphical user interface. A pair of lower-level debuggers, named \"DELTA\" and \"XDELTA\", can be used to debug privileged code in additional to normal application code.\nIn 2019, VSI released an officially supported Integrated Development Environment for VMS based on Visual Studio Code. This allows VMS applications to be developed and debugged remotely from a Microsoft Windows, macOS or Linux workstation.\nDatabase management.\nDEC created a number of optional database products for VMS, some of which were marketed as the \"VAX Information Architecture\" family. These products included:\nIn 1994, DEC sold Rdb, DBMS and CDD to Oracle, where they remain under active development. In 1995, DEC sold DSM to InterSystems, who renamed it \"Open M\", and eventually replaced it with their Cach\u00e9 product.\nExamples of third-party database management systems for OpenVMS include MariaDB, Mimer SQL (Itanium and x86-64), and System 1032.\nUser interfaces.\nVMS was originally designed to be used and managed interactively using DEC's text-based video terminals such as the VT100, or hardcopy terminals such as the DECwriter series. Since the introduction of the VAXstation line in 1984, VMS has optionally supported graphical user interfaces for use with workstations or X terminals such as the VT1000 series.\nText-based user interfaces.\nThe DIGITAL Command Language (DCL) has served as the primary command language interpreter (CLI) of OpenVMS since the first release. Other official CLIs available for VMS include the RSX-11 Monitor Console Routine (MCR) (VAX only), and various Unix shells. DEC provided tools for creating text-based user interface applications \u2013 the \"Form Management System\" (FMS) and \"Terminal Data Management System\" (TDMS), later succeeded by \"DECforms\". A lower level interface named \"Screen Management Services\" (SMG$), comparable to Unix curses, also exists.\nGraphical user interfaces.\nOver the years, VMS has gone through a number of different GUI toolkits and interfaces:\nVersions of VMS running on DEC Alpha workstations in the 1990s supported OpenGL and Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) graphics adapters. VMS also provides support for older graphics standards such as GKS and PHIGS. Modern versions of DECwindows are based on X.Org Server.\nSecurity.\nOpenVMS provides various security features and mechanisms, including security identifiers, resource identifiers, subsystem identifiers, ACLs, intrusion detection and detailed security auditing and alarms. Specific versions evaluated at Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria Class C2 and, with the SEVMS security enhanced release at Class B1. OpenVMS also holds an ITSEC E3 rating (see NCSC and Common Criteria). Passwords are hashed using the Purdy Polynomial.\nPOSIX compatibility.\nVarious official Unix and POSIX compatibility layers were created for VMS. The first of these was \"DEC/Shell\", which was a layered product consisting of ports of the Bourne shell from Version 7 Unix and several other Unix utilities to VAX/VMS. In 1992, DEC released the \"POSIX for OpenVMS\" layered product, which included a shell based on the KornShell. POSIX for OpenVMS was later replaced by the open-source \"GNV\" (GNU's not VMS) project, which was first included in OpenVMS media in 2002. Amongst other GNU tools, GNV includes a port of the Bash shell to VMS. Examples of third-party Unix compatibility layers for VMS include Eunice.\nHobbyist programs.\nIn 1997, OpenVMS and a number of layered products were made available free of charge for hobbyist, non-commercial use as part of the \"OpenVMS Hobbyist Program\". Since then, several companies producing OpenVMS software have made their products available under the same terms, such as Process Software. Prior to the x86-64 port, the age and cost of hardware capable of running OpenVMS made emulators such as SIMH a common choice for hobbyist installations.\nIn March 2020, HPE announced the end of the OpenVMS Hobbyist Program. This was followed by VSI's announcement of the \"Community License Program\" (CLP) in April 2020, which was intended as a replacement for the HPE Hobbyist Program. The CLP was launched in July 2020, and provides licenses for VSI OpenVMS releases on Alpha, Integrity and x86-64 systems. OpenVMS for VAX is not covered by the CLP, since there are no VSI releases of OpenVMS VAX, and the old versions are still owned by HPE.\nRelease history.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:row hover highlight/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "32737", "revid": "48736052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32737", "title": "Victoria Woodhull", "text": "American women's suffrage activist (1838\u20131927)\nVictoria Claflin Woodhull (born Victoria California Claflin; September 23, 1838\u00a0\u2013 June 9, 1927), later Victoria Woodhull Martin, was an American leader of the women's suffrage movement who ran for president of the United States in the 1872 election. While many historians and authors agree that Woodhull was the first woman to run for the presidency, some disagree with classifying it as a true candidacy because according to the Constitution she would have been too young to be president if elected.\nAn activist for women's rights and labor reforms, Woodhull was also an advocate of \"free love\", by which she meant the freedom to marry, divorce and bear children without social restriction or government interference. \"They cannot roll back the rising tide of reform,\" she often said. \"The world moves.\"\nWoodhull twice went from rags to riches, her first fortune being made on the road as a magnetic healer before she joined the spiritualist movement in the 1870s. Together with her sister, Tennessee Claflin, she was the first woman to operate a brokerage firm on Wall Street, making a second fortune. They were among the first women to found a newspaper in the United States, \"Woodhull &amp; Claflin's Weekly\", which began publication in 1870. Authorship of many of her articles is disputed (many of her speeches on these topics were collaborations between Woodhull, her backers, and her second husband, Colonel James Blood).\nWoodhull was politically active in the early 1870s when she was nominated as the first woman candidate for the United States presidency. Woodhull was the candidate in 1872 from the Equal Rights Party, supporting women's suffrage and equal rights; her running mate (unbeknownst to him) was abolitionist leader Frederick Douglass. Her campaign inspired at least one other woman \u2013 apart from her sister \u2013 to run for Congress. A check on her activities occurred when she was arrested on obscenity charges a few days before the election. Her paper had published an account of the alleged adulterous affair between the prominent minister Henry Ward Beecher and Elizabeth Richards Tilton that had rather more detail than was considered proper at the time. However, it all added to the sensational coverage of her candidacy.\nEarly life and education.\nVictoria California Claflin was born the seventh of ten children (six of whom survived to maturity), in the rural frontier town of Homer, Licking County, Ohio. Her mother, Mrs Roxanna \"Roxy\" Hummel Claflin, was born to unmarried parents and was illiterate. She had become a follower of the Austrian mystic Franz Mesmer and the new spiritualist movement. Her father, Reuben Buckman \"Buck\" Claflin, Esq., was a con man, lawyer and snake oil salesman. He came from an impoverished branch of the Massachusetts-based Scots-American Claflin family, semi-distant cousins to Massachusetts Governor William Claflin.\nWoodhull was whipped by her father, according to biographer Theodore Tilton. Biographer Barbara Goldsmith claimed she was also starved and sexually abused by her father when still very young. Goldsmith based her incest claim on a statement in Theodore Tilton's biography: \"But the parents, as if not unwilling to be rid of a daughter whose sorrow was ripening her into a woman before her time, were delighted at the unexpected offer.\" Biographer Myra MacPherson disputes Goldsmith's claim that \"Vickie often intimated that he sexually abused her\" as well as the accuracy of Goldsmith's saying that \"Years later, Vickie would say that Buck made her 'a woman before my time.'\" Macpherson wrote, \"Not only did Victoria not say this, there was no 'often' involved, nor was it about incest.\"\nWoodhull believed in spiritualism \u2013 she referred to \"Banquo's Ghost\" from Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\" \u2013 because it gave her belief in a better life. She said that she was guided in 1868 by Demosthenes to what symbolism to use supporting her theories of Free Love.\nAs they grew older, Victoria became close to her sister Tennessee Celeste Claflin (called Tennie), seven years her junior and the last child born to the family. As adults, they collaborated in founding a stock brokerage and newspaper in New York City.\nBy age 11, Woodhull had only three years of formal education, but her teachers found her to be extremely intelligent. She was forced to leave school and home with her family when her father, after having \"insured it heavily,\" burned the family's rotting gristmill. When he tried to get compensated by insurance, his arson and fraud were discovered; he was run off by a group of town vigilantes. The town held a \"benefit\" to raise funds to pay for the rest of the family's departure from Ohio.\nMarriages.\nFirst marriage and family.\nWhen she was 14, Victoria met 28-year-old Canning Woodhull (listed as \"Channing\" in some records), a doctor from a town outside Rochester, New York. Her family had consulted him to treat the girl for a chronic illness. Woodhull practiced medicine in Ohio at a time when the state did not require formal medical education and licensing. By some accounts, Woodhull abducted Victoria to marry her. Woodhull claimed to be the nephew of Caleb Smith Woodhull, mayor of New York City from 1849 to 1851; he was in fact a distant cousin.\nThey were married on November 20, 1853. Their marriage certificate was recorded in Cleveland on November 23, 1853, when Victoria was two months past her 15th birthday.\nVictoria soon learned that her new husband was an alcoholic and a womanizer. She often had to work outside the home to support the family. She and Canning had two children, Byron and Zulu (later called Zula) Maude Woodhull. Byron was born with an intellectual disability in 1854, a condition Victoria believed was caused by her husband's alcoholism. Another version recounted that her son's disability was caused by a fall from a window. After their children were born, Victoria divorced her husband and kept his surname.\nSecond marriage.\nAbout 1866, Woodhull married Colonel James Harvey Blood, who also was marrying for a second time. He had served in the Union Army in Missouri during the American Civil War, and had been elected as city auditor of St. Louis, Missouri.\nFree love.\nWoodhull's support of free love may have started after she discovered the infidelity of her first husband, Canning. Women who married in the United States during the 19th century were bound into the unions, even if loveless, with few options to escape. Divorce was limited by law and considered socially scandalous. Women who divorced were stigmatized and often ostracized by society. Victoria Woodhull concluded that women should have the choice to leave unbearable marriages.\nWoodhull believed in monogamous relationships, although she also said she had the right to change her mind. The choice to have sex or not was, in every case, the woman's choice, since this would place her in an equal status to the man, who had the capability to physically overcome and rape a woman, whereas a woman did not have that capability with respect to a man.\nWoodhull said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn this same speech, which became known as the \"Steinway speech,\" delivered on Monday, November 20, 1871, in Steinway Hall, New York City, Woodhull said of free love:\nYes, I am a Free Lover. I have an inalienable, constitutional and natural right to love whom I may, to love as long or as short a period as I can; to change that love every day if I please, and with that right neither you nor any law you can frame have any right to interfere.\nWoodhull railed against the hypocrisy of society's tolerating married men who had mistresses and engaged in other sexual dalliances. In 1872, Woodhull publicly criticized well-known clergyman Henry Ward Beecher for adultery. Beecher was known to have had an affair with his parishioner Elizabeth Tilton, who had confessed to it, and the scandal was covered nationally. Woodhull was prosecuted on obscenity charges for sending accounts of the affair through the federal mails, and she was briefly jailed. This added to sensational coverage during her campaign that autumn for the United States presidency.\nProstitution rumors and stance.\nWoodhull spoke out in person against prostitution and considered marriage for material gain a form of it but in her journal, \"Woodhull &amp; Claflin's Weekly,\" Woodhull expressed support for the legalization of prostitution. A personal account from one of Colonel Blood's friends suggests that Tennessee was held against her will in a brothel until Woodhull rescued her, but this story remains unconfirmed.\nReligious shift and repudiation of free love.\nWhile Woodhull's earlier radicalism had stemmed from the Christian socialism of the 1850s, for most of her life, she was involved in Spiritualism and she did not use religious language in her public speeches. However, in 1875, Woodhull began to publicly espouse Christianity and she changed her political stances. She exposed Spiritualist frauds in her periodical, alienating her Spiritualist followers. She wrote articles against promiscuity, calling it a \"curse of society\". Woodhull repudiated her earlier views on free love, and began idealizing purity, motherhood, marriage, and the Bible in her writings. She further claimed that some works had been written in her name without her consent, an assertion which many historians have found dubious.\nCareers.\nStockbroker.\nWoodhull, with sister Tennessee (Tennie) Claflin, became the first female stockbrokers and in 1870 they opened a brokerage firm on Wall Street. Wall Street brokers were shocked. \"Petticoats Among the Bovine and Ursine Animals\", the \"New York Sun\" headlined. Woodhull, Claflin &amp; Company opened in 1870, with the assistance of the wealthy Cornelius Vanderbilt, an admirer of Woodhull's skills as a medium; he is rumored to have been Tennie's lover, and to have seriously considered marrying her. Woodhull made a fortune on the New York Stock Exchange by advising clients like Vanderbilt. On one occasion she told him to sell his shares short for 150 cents per stock, which he duly followed, and earned millions on the deal. The \"New York Herald\" hailed Woodhull and Claflin as \"the Queens of Finance\" and \"the Bewitching Brokers.\" Many contemporary men's journals (e.g., \"The Days' Doings\") published sexualized images of the pair running their firm (although they did not participate in the day-to-day business of the firm), linking the concept of publicly minded, un-chaperoned women with ideas of \"sexual immorality\" and prostitution.\nNewspaper editor.\nOn the date of May 14, 1870, Woodhull and Claflin used the money they had made from their brokerage to found a newspaper, the \"Woodhull &amp; Claflin's Weekly\", which at its height had a national circulation of 20,000. Its primary purpose was to support Victoria Claflin Woodhull for President of the United States. Published for the next six years, feminism was the \"Weekly\"'s primary interest, but it became notorious for publishing controversial opinions on taboo topics, advocating among other things sex education, free love, women's suffrage, short skirts, spiritualism, vegetarianism, and licensed prostitution. History often states the paper advocated birth control, but some historians disagree. The paper is now known for printing the first English version of Karl Marx's \"Communist Manifesto\" in its edition of December 30, 1871. James Blood and Stephen Pearl Andrews wrote the majority of the articles, as well as other able contributors.\nIn 1872, the \"Weekly\" published a story that set off a national scandal and preoccupied the public for months. Henry Ward Beecher, a renowned preacher of Brooklyn's Plymouth Church, had condemned Woodhull's free love philosophy in his sermons but a member of his church, Theodore Tilton, disclosed to Elizabeth Cady Stanton, a colleague of Woodhull, that his wife had confessed Beecher was committing adultery with her. Provoked by such hypocrisy, Woodhull decided to expose Beecher. He ended up standing trial in 1875, for adultery in a proceeding that proved to be one of the most sensational legal episodes of the era, gripping the attention of hundreds of thousands of Americans: the trial ended with a hung jury, but the church won the case hands down. On November 2, 1872, Woodhull, Claflin and Col. Blood were arrested and charged with publishing an obscene newspaper and circulating it through the United States Postal Service. In the raid, 3,000 copies of the newspaper were found. It was this arrest and Woodhull's acquittal that propelled Congress to pass the 1873 Comstock Laws.\nGeorge Francis Train once defended her. Other feminists of her time, including Susan B. Anthony, disagreed with her tactics in pushing for women's equality. Some characterized her as opportunistic and unpredictable; in one notable incident, she had a run-in with Anthony during a meeting of the National Women's Suffrage Association (NWSA). (The radical NWSA later merged with the conservative American Women's Suffrage Association [AWSA] to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association.)\nWomen's rights advocate.\nWoodhull learned how to infiltrate the all-male domain of national politics and arranged to testify on women's suffrage before the House Judiciary Committee. In December 1870, she submitted a memorial in support of the New Departure to the House Committee. She read the memorial aloud to the committee, arguing that women already had the right to vote\u00a0\u2013 all they had to do was use it\u00a0\u2013 since the 14th and 15th Amendments guaranteed the protection of that right for all citizens. The simple but powerful logic of her argument impressed some committee members. Learning of Woodhull's planned address, suffrage leaders postponed the opening of the 1871 National Woman Suffrage Association's third annual convention in Washington in order to attend the committee hearing. Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Isabella Beecher Hooker, saw Woodhull as the newest champion of their cause. They applauded her statement: \"[W]omen are the equals of men before the law, and are equal in all their rights.\"\nWith the power of her first public appearance as a woman's rights advocate, Woodhull moved to the leadership circle of the suffrage movement. Although her constitutional argument was not original, she focused unprecedented public attention on suffrage. Woodhull was the second woman to petition Congress in person (the first was Elizabeth Cady Stanton). Numerous newspapers reported her appearance before Congress. \"Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper\" printed a full-page engraving of Woodhull, surrounded by prominent suffragists, delivering her argument.\nFirst International.\nWoodhull joined the International Workingmen's Association, also known as the First International. She supported its goals by articles in her newspaper. In the United States, many Yankee radicals, former abolitionists and other progressive activists, became involved in the organization, which had been founded in England. German-American and ethnic Irish nearly lost control of the organization, and feared its goals were going to be lost in the broad-based, democratic egalitarianism promoted by the Americans. In 1871, the Germans expelled most of the English-speaking members of the First International's U.S. sections, leading to the quick decline of the organization, as it failed to attract the ethnic working class in America. Karl Marx commented disparagingly on Woodhull in 1872, and expressed approval of the expulsions.\nRecent scholarship has shown Woodhull to have been a far more significant presence in the socialist movement than previous historians had allowed. Woodhull thought of herself as a revolutionary and her conception of social and political reorganization was, like Marx, based upon economics. In an article titled \"Woman Suffrage in the United States\" in 1896, she concluded that \"suffrage is only one phase of the larger question of women's emancipation. More important is the question of her social and economic position. Her financial independence underlies all the rest.\" Ellen Carol DuBois refers to her as a \"socialist feminist.\"\nPresidential candidate.\nOn April 2, 1870, Woodhull's letter to the editor of the \"New York Herald\" was published, announcing her candidacy. She was influenced by retired Civil War general and congressman Benjamin Butler by basing her candidacy on the idea that there was no need for women to have special legislation to win suffrage as they already had attained it through the 14th and 15th Amendments of the Constitution.\nWoodhull was nominated for president of the United States by the newly formed Equal Rights Party on May 10, 1872, at Apollo Hall, New York City. A year earlier, she had announced her intention to run. Also in 1871, she publicly spoke out against the government only being composed of men; she proposed the development of a new constitution and the creation of a new government a year thence. Her nomination was ratified at the convention on June 6, 1872, making her the first woman candidate.\nWoodhull's campaign was also notable because Frederick Douglass was nominated as its vice-presidential candidate, even though he did not take part in the convention. He did not acknowledge his nomination and did not play any active role in the campaign. His nomination stirred up controversy about the mixing of white and black people in public life, and fears of miscegenation. The Equal Rights Party hoped to use the nominations to reunite suffragists with African-American civil rights activists, because the exclusion of female suffrage from the Fifteenth Amendment two years earlier had caused a substantial rift between the groups.\nHaving been vilified in the media for her support of free love, Woodhull devoted an issue of \"Woodhull &amp; Claflin's Weekly\" (November 2, 1872) to an alleged adulterous affair between Elizabeth Tilton and Reverend Henry Ward Beecher, a prominent Protestant minister in Brooklyn. He supported female suffrage but had lectured against free love in his sermons. Woodhull published the article to highlight what she saw as a sexual double standard between men and women.\nThat same day, a few days before the presidential election, U.S. Federal Marshals arrested Woodhull, her second husband, Colonel James Blood, and her sister Tennie on charges of \"publishing an obscene newspaper\" because of the content of this issue. The sisters were held in the Ludlow Street Jail for the next month, a place normally reserved for civil offenses but that also held more hardened criminals. The arrest was arranged by Anthony Comstock, the self-appointed moral defender of the nation at the time. Opponents raised questions about censorship and government persecution. The three were acquitted on a technicality six months later, but the arrest prevented Woodhull from attempting to vote during the 1872 presidential election. With the publication of the scandal, Theodore Tilton, Elizabeth's husband, sued Beecher for \"criminal conversation\" (adultery) and alienation of affection. The 1875 trial was sensationalized across the nation and resulted in a hung jury.\nWoodhull received no electoral votes in the election of 1872, an election in which six different candidates received at least one electoral vote, and a negligible, but unknown, percentage of the popular vote. A man in Texas said that he had voted for her, saying he was casting his vote against Grant.\nWoodhull again tried to gain nominations for the presidency in 1884 and 1892. Newspapers reported that her 1892 attempt culminated in her nomination by the \"National Woman Suffragists' Nominating Convention\" on September 21. Marietta L. B. Stow of California was nominated as the candidate for vice president. The convention was held at Willard's Hotel in Boonville, New York, and Anna M. Parker was its president. Some women's suffrage organizations repudiated the nominations, claiming that the nominating committee was unauthorized. Woodhull was quoted as saying that she was \"destined\" by \"prophecy\" to be elected president of the United States in the upcoming election.\nLife in England and third marriage.\nIn October 1876, Woodhull divorced her second husband, Colonel Blood. After Cornelius Vanderbilt's death in 1877, William Henry Vanderbilt paid Woodhull and her sister Claflin $1,000 () to leave the country because he was worried they might testify in hearings on the distribution of the elder Vanderbilt's estate. The sisters accepted the offer and moved to Great Britain in August 1877.\nShe made her first public appearance as a lecturer at St. James's Hall in London on December 4, 1877. Her lecture was called \"The Human Body, the Temple of God,\" a lecture which she had previously presented in the United States. Present at one of her lectures was the banker John Biddulph Martin. They began to see each other and married on October 31, 1883. His family disapproved of the union.\nFrom then on, she was known as Victoria Woodhull Martin. Under that name, she published the magazine \"The Humanitarian\" from 1892 to 1901 with help from her daughter, Zula Woodhull. Her husband John died in 1897. After 1901, Martin gave up publishing and retired to the country, establishing residence at Norton Park, Bredon's Norton, Worcestershire, where she built a village school with Tennessee and Zula. Through her work at the Bredon's Norton school, she became a champion for education reform in English village schools with the addition of kindergarten curriculum.\nShe was active in the pioneering days of female motorists, with the Ladies' Automobile Club, and was reputed to have been the first woman to drive a car in Hyde Park, London and in the English country roads.\nViews on abortion and eugenics.\nWoodhull expressed thoughts on abortion:\nEvery woman knows that if she were free, she would never bear an unwished-for child, nor think of murdering one before its birth.\nIn one of her speeches, she states:\nThe rights of children, then, as individuals, begin while yet they are in foetal life. Children do not come into existence by any will or consent of their own.\nAt the Woodhull and Claflin's Weekly, on an essay called \"When Is It Not Murder to Take a Life?\", she asserts:\nMany women who would be shocked at the very thought of killing their children after birth, deliberately destroy them previously. If there is any difference in the actual crime we should be glad to have those who practice the latter, point it out. The truth of the matter is that it is just as much a murder to destroy life in its embryotic condition, as it is to destroy it after the fully developed form is attained, for it is the self-same life that is taken.\nLater in the same essay she asks:\nCan any one suggest a better than to so situate woman, that she may never be obligated to conceive a life she does not desire shall be continuous?Woodhull also promoted eugenics, which was popular in the early 20th century. Her views on eugenics tied into her views on abortion, because she blamed abortion for assorted problems with pregnancies. Her interest in eugenics might have been motivated by the profound intellectual impairment of her son. She advocated, among other things, sex education, \"marrying well,\" and pre-natal care as a way to bear healthier children and prevent mental and physical disease. Her writings express views which are closer to the views of anarchist eugenicists, rather than the views of coercive eugenicists like Sir Francis Galton. In 2006, publisher Michael W. Perry discovered writings which show that Woodhull supported the forcible sterilization of people who she considered unfit to breed. He published these writings in his book \"Lady Eugenist\". He cited a \"New York Times\" article from 1927 in which she concurred with the ruling of the case \"Buck v. Bell\". This was in stark contrast to her earlier works in which she advocated social freedom and opposed governmental interference in matters of love and marriage.\nWoodhull Martin died on June 9, 1927, at Norton Park in Bredon's Norton.\nLegacy and honors.\nWoodhull was photographed several times by Mathew Brady, well known for his photographs of the American Civil War.\nThere is a wall memorial to Victoria Woodhull Martin at Tewkesbury Abbey in England.\nA historical marker outside the Homer Public Library in Licking County, Ohio describes Woodhull as the \"First Woman Candidate For President of the United States.\"\nThere is a memorial clock tower in her honor at the Robbins Hunter Museum, Granville, Ohio. A likeness of Victoria made of linden wood appears on the hours.\nThe 1980 Broadway musical \"Onward Victoria\" was inspired by Woodhull's life.\nThe Woodhull Institute for Ethical Leadership was founded by Naomi Wolf and Margot Magowan in 1997.\nIn 2001, Victoria Woodhull was posthumously inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.\nThe Woodhull Sexual Freedom Alliance is an American human rights and sexual freedom advocacy organization, it was founded in 2003, and it is named in honor of Victoria Woodhull.\nShe was honored by the Office of the Manhattan Borough President in March 2008 and she was also included on a map of historical sites which are related or dedicated to important women.\nOn September 26, 2008, she was posthumously awarded the \"Ronald H. Brown Trailblazer Award\" from the St. John's University School of Law in Queens, New York. Mary L. Shearer, owner of the registered trademark Victoria Woodhull and a great-granddaughter of Col. James H. Blood's step-son, accepted the award on Victoria Woodhull's behalf. Trailblazer Awards are presented \"to individuals whose work and activities in the business and community demonstrate a commitment to uplifting under-represented groups and individuals.\"\nVictoria Bond composed the opera \"Mrs. President\" about Woodhull. It premiered in 2012 in Anchorage, Alaska.\nIn March 2017, Amazon Studios announced production of a movie based on her life, produced by and starring Brie Larson as Victoria Woodhull.\nReferences.\nCited works.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nSecondary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPrimary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The three models of strategic bomber, known collectively as the \"V class\", were the Vickers Valiant, which first flew in 1951 and entered service in 1955; the Avro Vulcan, which first flew in 1952 and entered service in 1956; and the Handley Page Victor, which first flew in 1952 and entered service in 1957. The V Bomber force reached its peak in June 1964 with 50 Valiants, 70 Vulcans and 39 Victors in service.\nWhen it became clear that the Soviet Union's surface-to-air missiles like the S-75 Dvina could bring down high-flying aircraft, the V bomber force changed to low-level attack methods. Additionally the Blue Steel missile profile was changed to one of low level penetration and release. This reduced its range significantly. It was then planned to move to the much longer-ranged Skybolt air-launched ballistic missile. When the US cancelled Skybolt, the survivability of the V force was highly questionable. This led to the Royal Navy taking over the nuclear deterrent role from 1968, using UGM-27 Polaris submarine launched ballistic missiles launched from nuclear submarines. The tactical role passed to smaller aircraft like the SEPECAT Jaguar and Panavia Tornado.\nThe V bombers were also capable of dropping conventional weapons, supported by a complex analogue computer system known as the Navigation and Bombing System that allowed accurate bombing even over very long ranges. The Valiants were used during the Suez Crisis as conventional bombers. Victors and Vulcans were deployed to the Malay Archipelago as a deterrent during the Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation but were not used in missions. The Vulcan is well-remembered for its conventional Black Buck bombing raids during the 1982 Falklands War. To support such missions, tanker aircraft versions of all three designs were developed. Reconnaissance versions were produced, and other modifications were also made during their lifetime.\nThe Valiants were removed from service in 1964 after problems with metal fatigue of their wings became apparent; a planned low-level variant did not progress beyond the prototype. Usage of all V bombers as weapons platforms, nuclear or conventional, ended in 1982.\nBackground.\nThe Royal Air Force (RAF) Bomber Command ended the Second World War with a policy of using heavy four-piston-engined bombers for massed raids, and remained committed to this policy in the immediate post-war period. The RAF adopted the Avro Lincoln, an updated version of the wartime Avro Lancaster, as its standard bomber for this purpose. Production of the Lincoln continued after the war, and eventually 450 were built. Although touted as a mighty bomber in 1945, it lacked the range to reach targets in the Soviet Union, and would be vulnerable to the new jet fighters that were then under development.\nElements within the RAF and the government sought to adopt the new nuclear weaponry and advances in aviation technology to introduce more potent and effective means of conducting warfare. In November 1944, the UK Chiefs of Staff had requested a report from Sir Henry Tizard on potential future means of warfare. Reporting without knowledge of the progress of Allied efforts to produce an atomic bomb, in July 1945 the Tizard Committee urged the encouragement of large-scale atomic energy research. It foresaw the devastating effects of atomic weapons and envisaged high-flying jet bombers cruising at at . It was thought that potential aggressors might be deterred by the knowledge that Britain would retaliate with atomic weapons if attacked.\nEven at the time, there were those who could see that guided missiles would eventually make such aircraft vulnerable, but development of such missiles was proving difficult, and fast and high-flying jet bombers were likely to serve for years before there was a need for something better. Massed bombers were unnecessary if a single bomber could destroy an entire city or military installation with a nuclear weapon. It would have to be a large bomber, since the first generation of nuclear weapons were big and heavy. Such a large and advanced bomber would be expensive on a per-unit basis, as it would be produced in small quantities.\nDuring the early part of the Second World War, Britain had a nuclear weapons project, codenamed Tube Alloys, which the 1943 Quebec Agreement merged with the American Manhattan Project. The British government trusted that the United States would continue to share nuclear technology, which it regarded as a joint discovery, after the war, but the United States Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act) ended technical co-operation. The British government saw this as a resurgence of United States isolationism, as had occurred after the First World War, and dreaded the possibility that Britain might have to fight an aggressor alone. It also feared that Britain might lose its great power status and its influence in world affairs. It therefore restarted its own nuclear weapons development effort, which was now codenamed High Explosive Research. The first British atomic bomb was tested in Operation Hurricane on 3 October 1952.\nDevelopment.\nIn November 1946, the Air Ministry issued an operational requirement (OR230) for an advanced jet bomber capable of carrying a bomb to a target from a base anywhere in the world with a cruising speed of and at an altitude of between . The bomb weight arose from an earlier operational requirement for an atomic bomb (OR1001), which specified a maximum weight of . The speed and altitude requirements were based on what was thought necessary to penetrate enemy air defences. The aircraft itself was to weigh no more than . The Ministry of Supply baulked, and initially refused to accept OR230. Calculations showed that such an aircraft would require a runway long. Bomber Command's runways were built to handle the Lancaster, and extending them would be an expensive undertaking, involving not only additional construction, but land acquisition and demolition works. OR230 would never be fulfilled, and was ultimately cancelled on 17 September 1952.\nThe Operational Requirements Committee met to discuss OR230 on 17 December 1946. This committee was chaired by the Vice-Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Sir William Dickson, with Stuart Scott-Hall, the Principal Director of Technical Development (Air) representing the Ministry of Supply. The result was a new Operational Requirement (OR229) on 7 January 1947. This was much the same as OR230, but the range was cut to , and the weight reduced to . OR229 formed the basis of an Air Ministry specification, B.35/46. A request for designs went to most of the United Kingdom's major aircraft manufacturers: Handley Page, Armstrong Whitworth, Avro, Bristol, Short Brothers and English Electric.\nOn 30 April 1947, Armstrong Whitworth, Avro, English Electric and Handley Page were invited to submit formal design tenders. A tender design conference was held on 28 July 1947, and decided to order the design submitted by Avro, along with a small flying model to test its delta wing design. The conference also decided to investigate the crescent wing concept as insurance against the favoured delta wing design being a failure. The Handley Page and Armstrong Whitworth designs were both considered. The Ministry of Supply gave financial cover in the form of an Intention to Proceed (ITP) order to Avro in November 1947. An advisory committee selected the Handley Page design on 23 December 1947, and it too was given an ITP.\nThe 17 December 1946 meeting that came up with OR230 also decided to solicit bids for a more conservative design that could be put into service more quickly, and could act as further insurance against the failure of both of the more advanced designs. This was expressed in another operational requirement (OR239), from which an Air Ministry specification, B.14/46, was generated, which was issued on 11 August 1947. This had lower cruising altitude and speed requirements than B.35/46, but was otherwise identical. A design was put forward by Shorts, which was given an ITP in November 1947. The result was an extremely conservative design with straight wings, the Short Sperrin, which was in practice little more than a jet-powered Lincoln.\nMeanwhile, Vickers-Armstrong had produced a swept wing design, the Vickers 660. This had been rejected because it did not meet the B.35/46 specification; but the estimated performance of the Sperrin caused officials at the Air Ministry to take another look. A new specification, B.9/48, was drawn up, based on the Vickers-Armstrong design, which was issued on 19 July 1948. An ITP was given to Vickers-Armstrong in April 1948, followed by a contract for two prototypes in February 1949, whereas Shorts was only awarded a contract for two prototypes in February 1949. The first prototype Vickers 660 flew on 18 May 1951, three months before the first prototype Sperrin, which first flew on 10 August 1951. No longer required, the Sperrin was cancelled; only the two prototypes were built.\nVickers-Armstrong named its aircraft the Vickers Valiant. Hitherto, bombers had been named after British or Commonwealth cities, but in October 1952 the Air Ministry decided to adopt alliterate names, with the other designs becoming the Avro Vulcan and the Handley-Page Victor. Henceforth, the three would be known as the V bombers. While more expensive than the approach of building one bomber design per category, the RAF insisted on having choice. Air Chief Marshal Sir John Slessor believed that had the air force been forced to choose among the three British bombers under development in the late 1930s\u2014the Avro Manchester, Short Stirling, and Handley Page Halifax\u2014it would have chosen the wrong one.\nAs a stop gap, the British announced on 27 January 1950 that it had agreed to acquire Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers from the United States free under the recently passed American Mutual Defense Assistance Act. This allowed the Air Ministry to drop the development of the Sperrin. The B-29 served in the RAF under the name of the Washington B1. The RAF received its first Washington on 22 March 1950, and the eighty-seventh was delivered in June 1952. Like the Lincoln, it was a piston-engine aircraft, and while it did have the range to reach the Soviet Union from British bases, it was not nuclear-capable. The RAF planned to use them against Soviet bomber bases. The Washingtons suffered from maintenance problems due to a lack of spare parts, and most were returned to the US between July 1953 and July 1954; four remained in service until 1958. Their role was assumed by the new jet-propelled English Electric Canberra bomber.\nIn service.\nFirst generation.\nWhen the first Blue Danube atomic bombs were delivered to the Bomber Command Armaments School at RAF Wittering on 7 and 11 November 1953, the RAF had no bombers capable of carrying them. Sir William Penney noted that \"the RAF has handled aircraft for a long time and can fly Valiants as soon as they come off the production line. But the Royal Air Force has not yet handled atomic weapons, therefore, we must get some bombs to the RAF at the earliest possible moment, so that the handling and servicing can be practised and fully worked out.\" The Canberra and Valiant were accorded \"super priority\" status on 13 March 1952, and in December the Vulcan and Victor also received it.\nThe Valiant went into production as the first V bomber in 1955. The Valiant entered service in February 1955, the Vulcan in May 1956 and the Victor in November 1957. No. 232 Operational Conversion Unit was formed at RAF Gaydon in June 1955 and aircrew training commenced. The first Valiant squadron, No. 138 Squadron, formed at RAF Gaydon in January 1955, followed by No. 543 Squadron, which was formed at RAF Gaydon on 1 June 1955 before moving to RAF Wyton. Two more Valiant bases were established at RAF Marham and RAF Honington in 1956, and six more squadrons were formed in quick succession: No. 214 Squadron at RAF Marham in March, No. 207 Squadron at RAF Marham and No. 49 Squadron at RAF Wittering in May, No. 148 Squadron at RAF Marham in July, No. 7 Squadron at RAF Honington in November and finally No. 90 Squadron at RAF Honington in January 1957.\nVulcan XA895 was allocated to No. 230 Operational Conversion Unit at RAF Waddington in January 1957, and Vulcan aircrew training commenced. The first Vulcan squadron, No. 83 Squadron, was formed at RAF Waddington in May 1957. It initially used aircraft borrowed from No. 230 Operational Conversion Unit until it received its first Vulcan, XA905, on 11 July 1957. It was followed by No. 101 Squadron, which was formed at RAF Finningley on 15 October 1957. A third Vulcan squadron, No. 617 Squadron, was formed on 1 May 1958 at RAF Scampton, the same base from which it carried out the Dambuster Raids in May 1943. No. 232 Operational Conversion Unit took delivery of its first Victor on 29 November 1957. The first operational Victor squadron was No. 10 Squadron RAF, which received its first Victor on 9 April 1958 and was formed on 15 April. This was followed by No. 15 Squadron, which was formed on 1 September 1958, and No. 57 Squadron, which was formed on 1 January 1959.\nThe UK nuclear strike force became known officially as the V force or Main Force. V force assets at the end of 1958 were:\nSecond generation.\nThe development of effective jet fighters and anti-aircraft missile defences promised to make the nuclear deterrent delivered from bombers flying at high altitudes increasingly ineffective. While making the V bombers fast enough to avoid them was problematic, improved engines offered the possibility of allowing them to fly higher. Since the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19 fighters coming into service in the Soviet Union had a ceiling of , a V bomber could avoid them by flying at over . Two dozen of a new model of the Vulcan, the B.2, with Bristol Olympus 201 engines, a slightly larger wingspan and new electrical and electronic systems were ordered on 25 February 1956. The last 17 aircraft outstanding from the September 1954 order and 8 from the March 1955 order were switched to the B.2, making a total of 49 on order. Another 40 were ordered on 22 January 1958. A pre-production model, XH533, first flew on 19 August 1958, and in a trial on 4 March 1959 it reached . The wings and new engines also increased the range by . The second production B.2, XH558, was delivered to No. 230 Operational Conversion Unit on 1 July 1960. As Vulcan B.2s were received, the B.1s were withdrawn from service and upgraded to B.1A standard through the installation of more electronics. Most of this work was carried out by Armstrong Whitworth.\nModifications were made to the Victor B.1 in 1959. These included the addition of an in-flight refuelling probe, new electronic countermeasures (ECM) equipment, tail-warning radar, drooped leading edges and a strengthened pressure cabin. This modified version was known as the Victor B.1A. An improved version of the Victor was also programmed with the Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire 9 engine, an improved version of the Sapphire 7 in the Victor B.1. However, development of the Sapphire 9 was cancelled by the Ministry of Supply in February 1956, and a minor improvement to the Sapphire 7 in March 1956 increased its thrust to , so it was decided to ship 25 of the next production batch of 33 Victors ordered in May 1955 with the Sapphire 7. The remaining eight, along with 18 more Victors ordered in January 1956, were built as Victor B.2s, with the Rolls-Royce Conway RCo.11 engines providing . The new Conway engines required redesigned enlarged intakes to provide the greater airflow required, and the wingspan was extended from . As in the Vulcan, the DC electrical system was replaced with an AC one. The prototype Victor B.2, XH668, first flew on 20 February 1959, but was lost over the Irish Sea on 20 August. The first production B.2, XL188, was delivered on 2 November 1961, and No. 139 Squadron became the first Victor B.2 squadron on 1 February 1962.\nV force assets at the end of 1962 were:\nThe V Bomber force reached its peak in June 1964, when 50 Valiants, 70 Vulcans and 39 Victors were in service. In retrospect, the decision to proceed with three V bombers was questionable. As it turned out, all the roles could have been performed by the Valiant, and its B.2 model was specifically designed for the low-level operations that the V bombers would employ in their later years. Moreover, the rationale for producing both the Vulcan and the Victor disappeared early on. That for producing the Victor B.2 instead of concentrating on the Vulcan B.2 was especially dubious, and Air Chief Marshal Sir Harry Broadhurst attributed it to lobbying by Sir Frederick Handley Page, a desire to retain jobs in the aviation industry, and because the government wanted the Rolls-Royce Conway engine produced for the Vickers VC10 airliner.\nNuclear mission.\nThe British government was well aware of the devastation that a nuclear war would bring. A 1953 report estimated that an attack on the UK with 132 fission weapons would generate 2 million casualties. A follow-on study, which considered the possible effect of hydrogen bombs, estimated that as few as ten could reduce the entire UK to a radioactive ruin. Given that defence was impractical, the UK turned to a policy of deterrence, by targeting the population and administrative centres of the Soviet Union. In 1957, the Air Ministry drew up a list of 131 Soviet cities with populations of 100,000 or more. Of these, 98 were within of the UK. Of these, 44 were selected. It was estimated that their destruction would kill about thirty per cent of the urban population of the Soviet Union, about 38 million people.\nIt was almost inconceivable that a war with the Soviet Union would not involve the United States, and as early as 1946, American defence planning envisaged using the UK as a base for nuclear strikes on the Soviet Union, as the United States Air Force (USAF) had not yet developed long-range bombers that could attack key targets in the Soviet Union from bases in the United States. But the United States strategy was that attacks on population centres would have little value once a war had actually begun, and prioritised military targets, particularly those from which nuclear weapons could be launched or deployed.\nCoordination of war plans between RAF Bomber Command and the USAF Strategic Air Command (SAC) was clearly desirable, and a joint war plan was negotiated between 1954 and 1958. The RAF's nuclear force was capable of destroying key targets before bomber aircraft from the United States had entered Soviet airspace, \"taking into account Bomber Command\u2019s ability to be on target in the first wave several hours in advance of the main SAC force operating from bases in the United States.\" Based on the assumption that RAF Bomber Command would have about 100 V bombers in operations by 1959, the SAC/RAF agreement assigned 106 targets to the UK: 69 cities, 17 long-range aviation bases, and 20 air-defence sites. Attacks on the air-defence installations would clear the way for waves of SAC bombers to follow. The plan was updated annually; as Soviet capabilities improved, more emphasis was placed on attacking airfields and missile bases.\nNuclear testing.\nSpecial Valiant unit No. 1321 Flight was formed at RAF Wittering on 3 August 1954 which conducted ballistic test trials with Blue Danube practice bombs. It became C Flight of No. 138 Squadron in March 1956, and No. 49 Squadron on 1 May 1956.\nValiants WZ366 and WZ367 were then flown to Maralinga, South Australia for Operation Buffalo. Valiant B.1 WZ366 of No. 49 Squadron became the first RAF aircraft to drop an operational atomic bomb when it performed a test drop of a down-rated 3-kt Blue Danube at Maralinga on 11 October 1956. The bomb landed about left and short of the target. The pilot was Squadron Leader Edwin Flavell, and the bomb aimer was Flight Lieutenant Eric Stacey, and both were awarded the Air Force Cross in the 1957 New Year Honours.\nOn 15 May 1957, Valiant B.1 XD818 flown by Wing Commander Kenneth Hubbard dropped the first British hydrogen bomb over the Pacific, the \"Short Granite\", as part of Operation Grapple. No. 49 Squadron was selected to perform the live weapon drop and was equipped with specially modified Valiants to conform with the scientific requirements of the tests and other precautionary measures to protect against heat and radiation. The test was largely a failure, as the measured yield was less than a third of the maximum expected and the device failed to achieve a thermonuclear explosion as intended. The first British hydrogen bomb that detonated as planned was Grapple X Round A, dropped on 8 November 1957. The Grapple series of tests continued into 1958, and the Grapple Y bomb exploded in April 1958 with ten times the yield of the original \"Short Granite\". Testing was finally terminated in November 1958 when the British government decided to cease atmospheric testing.\nProject E.\nAs V bomber production picked up, the number of bombers exceeded the number of available British nuclear weapons. Britain had only ten nuclear bombs in 1955, and just 14 in 1956. To make up the difference, American nuclear weapons were obtained through Project E. Since they were in American custody, they were not available for the RAF to use as part of the UK's independent national nuclear deterrent; only British-owned weapons could be used for that purpose. The Vulcan and Victor were armed with British-built bombs Blue Danube, Red Beard, Violet Club, and Yellow Sun of both the Mk 1 and Mk 2 versions. Project E modifications to Valiants commenced at RAE Farnborough in February 1956. Crew training was carried out with American instructors at RAF Boscombe Down.\nThe planned V bomber force was reduced to 144 aircraft, and it was planned to equip half of them with Project E weapons. The first 28 Valiants were modified by October 1957; the remaining 20 Valiants, along with 24 Vulcans, were ready by January 1959. Under the Project E Memorandum of Understanding, US personnel had custody of the weapons. That meant they performed all the tasks related to their storage, maintenance and readiness. While the bombs were at the same bases as the bombers, they were stored in Secure Storage Areas (SSAs) that British staff were not permitted to enter. It was therefore impossible to store British and American bombs together in the same SSA. Bomber Command designated RAF Marham, RAF Waddington and RAF Honington as bases with US SSAs. Another three sites had British SSAs. US custody created operational problems. The procedure for handing over the bombs added an extra ten minutes to the bombers' reaction time, and the requirement that US personnel had guardianship of the weapons at all times meant that neither they nor the bombers could be relocated to dispersal airfields as the RAF desired.\nInitially, 72 Mark 5 nuclear bombs were supplied for the V bombers. They had a yield of up to . The successful British development of the hydrogen bomb, and a favourable international relations climate caused by the Sputnik crisis, led to the United States Atomic Energy Act being amended again in 1958, resulting in the long-sought resumption of the nuclear Special Relationship between Britain and the United States in the form of the 1958 US\u2013UK Mutual Defence Agreement. The United States now agreed to supply the V bombers with megaton weapons in place of the Mark 5, in the form of Mark 15 and Mark 39 nuclear bombs. The Treasury immediately inquired as to whether this meant that the British megaton bomb programme could be terminated. The answer was no; the operational restrictions imposed by Project E \"effectively handed the US government a veto over the use of half of Britain's nuclear deterrent\". With sufficient British bombs on hand, operational issues, and the concept of an independent nuclear deterrent came to the fore.\nThe Air Council decided on 7 July 1960 that Project E weapons would be phased out by December 1962, by which time it was anticipated that there would be sufficient British megaton weapons to equip the entire strategic bomber force. Project E weapons were replaced by British Yellow Sun bombs at RAF Honington on 1 July 1961 and Waddington on 30 March 1962. Problems encountered in the development of the Red Beard bomb meant that the replacement of kiloton weapons took longer. The UK-based Valiants at Honington and Wittering were withdrawn in April and October 1962, and the last Valiants were retired from the V bomber force in July 1965. The final practice loading at RAF Marham\u2014with the Mark 43s\u2014was in January 1965, and the last US personnel left the base in July.\nLow level strike.\nThe prospect of bombers being able to avoid the Soviet air defences dimmed with the appearance of the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21, which Nigel Birch, the Secretary of State for Air and senior RAF officers saw at Tushino Airfield on 24 June 1956. There was no immediate concern as Soviet designs often took several years to deploy; but its ceiling of posed a clear threat to the V bombers. So too did the new SA-2 surface-to-air missiles, which appeared in 1957. One of them shot down an American Lockheed U-2 piloted by Francis Gary Powers over the Soviet Union on 1 May 1960. In 1957, the supersonic Avro 730 bomber was cancelled. This freed up funds for the Blue Streak missile programme, but it too was cancelled, on 24 February 1960. To extend the effectiveness and operational life of the V bombers, an Operational Requirement (OR1132), was issued on 3 September 1954 for an air-launched, rocket-propelled standoff missile with a range of that could be launched from a V bomber. This became Blue Steel. The Ministry of Supply placed a development contract with Avro in March 1956, and it entered service in December 1962.\nBy this time, it was anticipated that even with Blue Steel, the air defences of the Soviet Union would soon improve to the extent that V bombers might find it difficult to attack their targets, and there were calls for the development of the Blue Steel Mark II with a range of at least . Despite the name, this was a whole new missile, and not a development of the Mark I. The Minister of Aviation, Duncan Sandys, insisted that priority be accorded to getting the Mark I into service, and the Mark II was cancelled at the end of 1959. Considerable modification was required to enable the Victors to carry Blue Steel. These included structural changes to the bomb bay. New Conway RCo.17 engines were installed, along with a combustor ignition system to allow all four engines to be started simultaneously and reduce scramble time to &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1+1\u20442 minutes per aircraft. A total of 23 Victor B.2 aircraft were upgraded to the new standard, known as B.2R (for retrofit), and two more were built as such.\nThe British government then turned to Skybolt, an American missile that combined the range of Blue Streak with the mobile basing of the Blue Steel, and was small enough that two could be carried on the Vulcan bomber. Armed with a British Red Snow warhead, this would improve the capability of the UK's V bomber force, and extend its useful life into the late 1960s and early 1970s. Cabinet Defence Committee approved the acquisition of Skybolt in February 1960. The Vulcan B.2s were modified to carry a pair of Skybolt missiles. They were fitted with Bristol Olympus 301 engines, strengthened wings and two special attachment points. A British warhead was designed to fit in Skybolt's nose cone, and dummy test firings were carried out at RAF West Freugh commencing on 9 December 1961. It did not prove possible to modify the Victors. The project came to an abrupt halt when the US government cancelled Skybolt on 31 December 1962, but the vestigial attachment points were used for AN/ALQ-101 electronic countermeasure pods during the Falklands War. To replace Skybolt, the Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan, negotiated the Nassau Agreement with the President of the United States John F. Kennedy on 3 January 1963, under which the US agreed to supply the UK with Polaris submarine-launched ballistic missiles instead. This spelt the beginning of the end of the V bombers' nuclear deterrent, but six more years passed before the submarines were built and the Royal Navy was able to take over responsibility.\nAlthough originally part of the V force, three squadrons of Valiants were assigned to SACEUR as part of the TBF (Tactical Bomber Force), while remaining part of Bomber Command for training and administration. As the new Victors and Vulcans became available, Valiants became surplus to the planned V force of 144 aircraft. It was proposed that 24 Valiants could replace 64 Canberra bombers. This represented a numerical reduction in the force available to SACEUR, but an improvement in capability due to the Valiants' all-weather strike capacity. The decision was taken by the Air Council on 15 May 1958. The first squadron to be assigned was No. 207 Squadron, on 1 January 1960. It was followed by No. 49 Squadron on 1 July, and No. 148 on 13 July. No. 49 Squadron moved to RAF Marham so that all three squadrons were concentrated there. They were each equipped with two Mark 28 nuclear bombs provided by Project E. The three TBF squadrons eventually became the only Valiant bomber squadrons as all the others were disbanded or converted to tanker or strategic reconnaissance roles. They adopted SACEUR's Quick Reaction Alert, under which arrangements were made so that three armed aircraft were always ready to scramble within 15 minutes. They were also the first V bombers to adopt a low-level strike role, with their white paintwork replaced by green camouflage. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, each V force squadron kept one fully armed aircraft and crew at 15 minutes' readiness.\nBy 1963, the RAF was convinced that, to have any chance of survival, the V bombers would have to attack at low level. At altitudes below , radar was less effective due to ground-generated clutter. The three Vulcan B.1A squadrons at RAF Waddington and the four Victor B.1A squadrons at RAF Honington and RAF Cottesmore were ordered to switch to low-level operations in March 1963. The Vulcan B.2 and Victor B.2 squadrons followed on 1 May 1964. A sign of the new doctrine was the replacement of their white paintwork with green camouflage on their upper surfaces, starting with Vulcan XH505 on 24 March 1964. They were also outfitted with new ECMs, ground positioning equipment and terrain-following radar. Tests performed in the UK and at Woomera demonstrated that Blue Steel could be launched from low level. The Yellow Sun Mark 2 free-fall bomb was a different story, and V bombers equipped with it would have had to climb to medium altitude to release it. A new bomb, the WE.177 was developed. Deliveries of the WE.177B commenced in September 1966. Through Project E and the introduction of the smaller, lighter Red Beard bomb, which entered service in 1960, by the mid-1960s Canberras and the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm were able to deliver nuclear weapons, but their power was insignificant compared with that of the 109 Victor and Vulcan bombers.\nThe V bombers were formally relieved of their role as the deliverer of the UK strategic nuclear deterrent, which officially passed to the Polaris ballistic missile submarines of the Royal Navy on 1 July 1969. The last Blue Steel mission was flown on 21 December 1970. Five Vulcan squadrons continued to serve with the WE.177B weapon in a tactical role in Europe with SACEUR. Nos 9 and 35 Squadrons moved to RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, where they replaced Canberra bombers in support of CENTO and operations on NATO's southern flank. They were withdrawn in 1975 in the wake of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. Six squadrons of Vulcans were still assigned this role with the WE.177 weapon in 1981. The last four remaining squadrons were about to disband in 1982 when called upon to assist in the Falklands War.\nConventional mission.\nSuez crisis.\nThe first V bomber to see combat use with conventional bombs was the Valiant in Operation Musketeer, the Anglo-French military response in the Suez Crisis in 1956. It was the first and only time the Valiants dropped bombs in combat operations. RAF units began deploying to Malta in September 1956, and when Israel attacked Egypt on 29 October 1956, four Valiant squadrons\u2014Nos 138, 148, 207 and 214 Squadrons\u2014were based at RAF Luqa. No. 138 Squadron was the only one with a full complement of eight Valiants; Nos 148 and 207 each had six, and No. 214 had only four. The initial objective was to neutralise the Egyptian Air Force, which was believed to have about 100 Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 jet fighters and 30 Ilyushin Il-28 twin-engine jet bombers. The Egyptian early-warning radar system was known to be non-operational due to lack of maintenance and spare parts, so the bombers were ordered to operate at night when the visually-controlled defences would be least effective. This meant a reversion to the tactics used by Bomber Command in the Second World War. The Valiants were neither trained nor equipped for such a mission. Not all of the Valiants were equipped with the Navigation and Bombing System (NBS) and it was not serviceable in all of those that were. This forced a reversion to the older, visual bomb sight. The Valiants and Canberras were equipped with the Gee-H radio navigation system, but it could not be used as there were no beacons in the Middle East. However, the Valiants were also equipped with Green Satin radar, which could still be used.\nThe first mission was flown on 31 October, in co-operation with Canberra bombers from Malta and Cyprus. The target was five Egyptian airbases in the Cairo area, including Cairo West Air Base. At the last minute, it was discovered that fifteen US transport aircraft were at Cairo West evacuating civilians, and the target had to be altered while the bombers were already in the air. The Valiants dropped target markers, and then Canberras dropped flares to illuminate the target area. This allowed other Canberras to drop bombs on the runways. This pattern was repeated in attacks on four airfields in the Nile Delta and eight in the Suez Canal area over the next two nights. The Valiant's final mission was flown on 3 November against El Agami Island, which was believed to be a submarine repair depot. By the time operations ended, of bombs had been dropped, half of which had fallen within of their targets. The results were unimpressive. Three of the seven main Egyptian airbases remained fully operational, one had its runway shortened, and one had three craters that needed filling. The only airbase that was completely out of commission was Cairo West, and then only because of Egyptian demolitions.\nFar East operations.\nOn 29 October 1957, three Valiants from No. 214 Squadron flew to RAF Changi in Singapore for a fortnight to gain experience operating in the Far East. This was known as Exercise Profiteer. Subsequently, small detachments of Valiants and Vulcans deployed to the Far East for a fortnight every three months until June 1960. Although the Malayan Emergency was ongoing at this time, none of the Exercise Profiteer aircraft participated in combat operations. When the Valiants were assigned to SACEUR for operations in Europe, the conventional mission in the Middle East was assigned to the Vulcans at RAF Waddington, while that in the Far East was given to the Victors based at RAF Cottesmore and RAF Honington. When the Indonesian Confrontation heated up in December 1963, eight Victors from Nos 10 and 15 Squadrons were sent to the Far East, where they were based at RAF Tengah and RAAF Butterworth. The crews normally served 3&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442-month tours. No. 10 Squadron was disbanded in March 1964, and No. 15 Squadron in October. No. 12(B) Squadron replaced them at RAAF Butterworth from October. The Vulcans were recalled to UK in December 1964 whilst the responsibility for the Far East fell on temporary detachments of Vulcans of Nos 9, 12 and 35 Squadrons with up to 16 aircraft for short periods. Tensions decreased after March 1965, and the size of the detachment was cut to four aircraft. As the Waddington Wing converted to the Mk2 Vulcan the responsibility was transferred to Nos 44, 50 and 101 Squadrons. Annual deployments in support of SEATO continued for some years.\nFalklands War.\nDuring the 1982 Falklands War, Vulcan bombers from Nos 44, 50 and 101 Squadrons, supported by Victor tankers from Nos 55 and 57 Squadrons, carried out a series of seven extremely long-range ground attack missions against Argentine positions in the Falkland Islands. The operation was codenamed Black Buck. The objectives of the missions were to attack Port Stanley Airport and its associated defences. While the Vulcans were capable of carrying conventional munitions, this had not been done for a long time. To carry twenty-one bombs, the Vulcan required three sets of bomb carriers, each of which held seven bombs. Their release was controlled by a panel at the navigator's station known as a 90-way that monitored the electrical connections to each bomb, and was said to provide 90 different sequences for releasing the bombs. None of the Vulcans at RAF Waddington were fitted with the bomb racks or the 90-way. A search of the supply dumps at Waddington and RAF Scampton located the 90-way panels, which were fitted and tested, but finding enough septuple bomb carriers proved harder, and at least nine were required. Someone remembered that some had been sold to a scrapyard in Newark-on-Trent, and they were retrieved from there. Locating sufficient bombs also proved difficult, and only 167 could be found, and some had cast bomb cases instead of the preferable machined ones. Training of crews in conventional bombing and in-flight refuelling was carried out from 14 to 17 April 1982.\nThe raids, at almost and 15 hours for the return journey, were the longest-ranged bombing raids in history at the time. The Black Buck raids were staged from RAF Ascension Island, close to the equator. The Vulcans lacked the range to fly to the Falklands without refuelling several times, as did the converted Victor tankers, so they too had to be refuelled in flight. Eleven tankers were required for two Vulcans, a huge logistical effort as all aircraft had to use the same runway. The aircraft carried either twenty-one bombs internally or two or four Shrike anti-radar missiles externally. Of the five Black Buck raids flown to completion, three were against Stanley Airfield's runway and operational facilities, and the other two were anti-radar missions using Shrike missiles against a Westinghouse AN/TPS-43 long-range 3D radar in the Port Stanley area. Shrikes hit two of the less valuable and rapidly replaced secondary fire control radars, causing minor damage.\nWithdrawal of the Valiants.\nIn July 1964, a Valiant of No. 543 Squadron (WZ394) on a deployment to Rhodesia was found to have cracks in the rear wing spar and was ferried back to the UK for repairs. The following month, a Valiant from No. 232 Operational Conversion Unit (WP217) suffered a wing spar failure during a training exercise over Wales. The whole Valiant fleet was checked, and many were found to have significant cracks in the wing spars. Those that were considered to have little or no damage were cleared to fly, but with a temporary restriction to a maximum speed of , maximum load of , and a maximum bank angle of 30 degrees. When Vickers commenced repairs, it was found that the damage was more severe than first thought, and the entire fleet was grounded on 9 December 1964, and withdrawn from service. At first it was thought that the switch to low-level flying was the cause, but cracks were also found in Valiants that were in service as tanker and strategic reconnaissance aircraft, and had not been flown at low level. Suspicion then fell on the aluminium alloy that had been used, DTD683. One Valiant (XD816) remained in service as a test aircraft, having been re-sparred.\nElectronic countermeasures and reconnaissance.\nValiants served in a photo-reconnaissance role with No. 543 Squadron, commencing in the second half of 1955. At least seven Valiants were configured to the ECM role, serving with No. 199 Squadron from 30 September 1957. These aircraft were ultimately fitted with APT-16A and ALT-7 jamming transmitters, Airborne Cigar and Carpet jammers, APR-4 and APR-9 \"sniffing\" receivers, and chaff dispensers. After the Valiants were grounded, the timetable for the development of a photo-reconnaissance version of the Victor, known as the SR.2, was accelerated. A prototype (XL165) was flown for the first time on 23 February 1965, and the first aircraft (XL230) was delivered to No. 543 Squadron on 18 May 1965. The Victor SR.2s carried out extensive photographic survey work, which assumed increased importance after the bombers switched to low-level operations. No. 543 Squadron was disbanded on 31 May 1974, but a flight of four remained until 30 March 1975 to participate in French nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific. Responsibility for the reconnaissance role passed to No. 27 Squadron, which had been re-formed in November 1973, and operated the Vulcan SR.2. No. 27 Squadron was disbanded in March 1982.\nAerial refuelling.\nIn addition to the roles for which they were designed, all three V bombers served as aerial refuelling tankers at one time or another. The Valiant was the RAF's first large-scale tanker. The probe and drogue system for aerial refuelling was developed by Sir Alan Cobham, but the Air Ministry doubted its value so long as Britain maintained bases around the world. However, on 8 January 1954, the Air Staff decided that the V bombers should be capable of both aerial refuelling and acting as tankers, and an Operational Requirement (OR3580) was issued in 1956 for an electronic positioning system to facilitate aerial refuelling. Initially, there were no aircraft to perform the role, but two new types of Valiant were ordered. Fourteen B(PR)K.1 versions were produced. These were a tanker variant of the photo-reconnaissance model, with a hose drum unit (HDU) in the bomb bay. The final production model of the Valiant was the BK.1 version, which had a fuel tank in the front of the bomb bay and an HDU in the rear. Some 44 were built. No. 214 Squadron was selected to carry out tanker trials, while retaining its bombing role, in February 1958. The trials were successful. In August 1961, a second Valiant squadron, No. 90 Squadron, was ordered to begin training in the aerial refuelling role. Nos 90 and 214 Squadrons became full-time tanker squadrons on 1 April 1962. In a demonstration on 20/21 June 1962, a Vulcan B.1A from No. 617 Squadron flew non-stop from RAF Scampton to Sydney in 20 hours and 5 minutes, refuelled four times by tankers from No. 214 Squadron. They served in the role until the Valiants were abruptly withdrawn from service.\nWork was already under way to replace the Valiants with Victors. A proposal to convert Victor B.1s and B.1As was first considered by the Air Staff on 25 May 1961 and was endorsed by the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence, Sir Solly Zuckerman, and the Chiefs of Staff in 1963. The Defence Research Policy Committee (DRPC) estimated that converting 27 aircraft would cost \u00a37 million. This would provide sufficient aircraft for three tanker squadrons. The price tag soon increased to \u00a38 million for 24 aircraft, and the Treasury was reluctant to spend that much money pending a review of Britain's overseas defence commitments, which would establish whether a third squadron was required. There were also doubts about the financial viability of Handley Page. Approval was given for the conversion of twelve aircraft on 12 June, three more on 9 July, and another nine on 15 September. The second production Victor B.1 (XA918) was converted into a prototype tanker. This involved the installation of Flight Refuelling Mark 20B pods on each wing to refuel fighter aircraft, two fuel tanks in the bomb bay, and a Flight Refuelling Mark 17 HDU in the bomb bay for bombers and transport aircraft. The grounding of the Valiant tankers injected some urgency into the situation, as the RAF lost its refuelling capability. Six Victor K.1A tankers were delivered to No. 55 Squadron at RAF Marham in May and June 1965, but these were not full conversions, as they had only the underwing refuelling pods, and retained their bombing capability.\nAs Victor tankers became available, a second tanker squadron, No. 57 Squadron, was formed at RAF Marham on 14 February 1966, and a third was added on 1 July 1966 when No. 214 Squadron was re-formed. The last Victor bomber squadrons, Nos 100 and 139 Squadrons, were disbanded on 1 October and 31 December 1968 respectively. It was decided to convert their Victor B.2s into tankers. However, while the Vulcans' rigid delta wing coped well with low-altitude flight, it subjected the Victors' slender wings to considerable flexing, and they suffered badly from fatigue cracks. Repairing them became a major cost of the tanker conversion programme, and some Victors were determined to be beyond economical repair. The Victor SR.2s were withdrawn from service to make up the numbers, and were replaced by Vulcans. Due to the increased costs, none of the SR.2s were modified, and only 21 Victor K.2 tankers were converted. Handley Page went into liquidation in August 1969, and the subsequent work was undertaken by Hawker Siddeley. The first Victor K.2 tanker made its maiden flight on 1 March 1972. No. 55 Squadron began re-equipping with the Victor K.2 on 1 July 1975, followed by No. 57 Squadron on 7 June 1976. No. 214 Squadron retained its K.1As until it was disbanded on 28 February 1977, reducing the RAF's tanker fleet to just two squadrons.\nDuring the Falklands War, the commitments of the Victor tanker fleet became overwhelming. All available tankers were deployed to support operations there. Only the Victor tanker fleet made it possible for the transport aircraft to reach Ascension Island with vital supplies, and for the Vulcan bombers to reach the Falkland Islands for Operation Black Buck. In the meantime, the RAF forces in the UK were serviced by USAF Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers. Work was in progress to convert VC-10s into tankers, but as an interim measure it was decided to convert some Lockheed C-130 Hercules and Vulcan bombers. The equipment in the ECM bay was removed and a Mark 17 HDU installed there. The first of six converted Vulcan tankers (XH561 - the others being XH558, XH560, XJ825, XL445 and XM571) flew on 18 June 1982, just seven weeks after the conversion work began, and the first Vulcan K.2 tanker was delivered to the RAF five days later. The HDUs used were those earmarked for the VC-10 conversion programme, so as these were completed, the HDUs were removed from the Vulcans, starting with Vulcan XJ825 on 4 May 1983.\nNo. 617 Squadron was disbanded on 31 December 1981, followed by No. 35 Squadron on 1 March 1982, and No. 9 Squadron on 1 May 1982. This left only Nos 44, 50 and 101 Squadrons at RAF Waddington, which were all scheduled to disband by 1 July 1982, with their tactical nuclear mission passing to the Panavia Tornado. The Falklands War intervened, providing a temporary reprieve. No. 101 Squadron was disbanded on 4 August 1982, and No. 44 Squadron on 21 December 1982. The last Vulcan unit, No. 50 Squadron at RAF Waddington, was disbanded on 13 March 1984, leaving behind six K.2s and three B.2s. The Ministry of Defence decided to retain a Vulcan in service for air shows. This role was filled by XL426, and then by XH558.In 1992, XH558 was sold to a private owner, and it made its last RAF flight on 23 March 1993.\nThe Victor tankers saw active service again in the Gulf War, with eight deploying to Muharraq in Bahrain between December 1990 and March 1991. Victor tankers subsequently deployed to Akrotiri in support of Operation Warden, the operations to protect Kurdish communities in the northern part of Iraq, and to Muharraq in support of Operation Jural in southern Iraq. The tankers returned to RAF Marham in September 1993, where No. 55 Squadron, the last Victor unit, was disbanded on 15 October 1993.\nPreservation.\nOn 8 February 2007, the Royal Air Force Museum Midlands opened the National Cold War Exhibition at RAF Cosford in Shropshire to tell the story of the Cold War. This exhibition brought together static displays of all three types of V bomber in one location for the first time. The museum's director general, Dr Michael A. Fopp, stated the goal was \"people will leave feeling better informed about what happened in the second half of the 20th Century.\"\nVulcan XH558 (Civil Registration G-VLCN), flew until October 2015, funded by public donations. It was displayed at air shows and events. It will be used as a centrepiece for engineering excellence, showing what an advanced design it was for the period.\nOn 26 September 2022, at Imperial War Museum Duxford, Victor XH648 was put on display after 8 years of restoration at the museum - Funded by donations from the public - costing \u00a3450,000. Veterans who flew the aircraft were invited to observe its official unveiling in the museum before it was put on public display. It is currently being displayed in the AirSpace hanger at the museum. \nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "32742", "revid": "46443173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32742", "title": "Virginia Woolf", "text": "English modernist writer (1882\u20131941)\nAdeline Virginia Woolf (; n\u00e9e\u00a0Stephen; 25 January 1882\u00a0\u2013 28 March 1941) was an English writer and one of the most influential 20th-century modernist authors. She helped to pioneer the use of stream of consciousness narration as a literary device.\nVirginia Woolf was born in South Kensington, London, into an affluent and intellectual family as the seventh child of Julia Prinsep Jackson and Leslie Stephen. She grew up in a blended household of eight children, including her sister, the painter Vanessa Bell. Educated at home in English classics and Victorian literature, Woolf later attended King\u2019s College London, where she studied classics and history and encountered early advocates for women\u2019s rights and education.\nAfter the death of her father in 1904, Woolf and her family moved to the bohemian Bloomsbury district, where she became a founding member of the influential Bloomsbury Group. She married Leonard Woolf in 1912, and together they established the Hogarth Press in 1917, which published much of her work. They eventually settled in Sussex in 1940, maintaining their involvement in literary circles throughout their lives.\nWoolf began publishing professionally in 1900 and rose to prominence during the interwar period with novels like \"Mrs Dalloway\" (1925), \"To the Lighthouse\" (1927), and \"\" (1928), as well as the feminist essay \"A Room of One\u2019s Own\" (1929). Her work became central to 1970s feminist criticism and remains influential worldwide, having been translated into over 50 languages. Woolf\u2019s legacy endures extensive scholarship, cultural portrayals, and tributes such as memorials, societies, and university buildings bearing her name.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLife.\nEarly life.\nVirginia Woolf was born Adeline Virginia Stephen on 25 January 1882, in South Kensington, London, to Julia (n\u00e9e Jackson) and Sir Leslie Stephen. Her father was a writer, historian, essayist, biographer, and mountaineer, while her mother was a noted philanthropist. Woolf's maternal relatives include Julia Margaret Cameron, a celebrated photographer, and Lady Henry Somerset, a campaigner for women's rights. Originally named after her aunt Adeline, Woolf did not use her first name due to her aunt's recent death. Virginia's great-nephew, the historian William Dalrymple, has claimed that Virginia was part Bengali through her maternal grandmother, Maria Theodosia Pattle.\nBoth Virginia's parents had children from previous marriages. Julia's first marriage, to barrister Herbert Duckworth, produced three children: George, Stella, and Gerald. Leslie's first marriage, to Minny Thackeray, daughter of William Makepeace Thackeray, resulted in one daughter, Laura. Leslie and Julia Stephen had four children together: Vanessa, Thoby, Virginia, and Adrian.\nVirginia showed an early affinity for writing. By the age of five, she was writing letters, and her fascination with books helped form a bond with her father. From the age of 10, she began an illustrated family newspaper, the \"Hyde Park Gate News\", chronicling life and events within the Stephen family, and modelled on the popular magazine \"Tit-Bits\". Virginia would run the \"Hyde Park Gate News\" until 1895. In 1897, Virginia began her first diary, which she kept for the next twelve years.\nTalland House.\nIn the spring of 1882, Leslie rented a large white house in St Ives, Cornwall. The family spent three months each summer there for the first 13 years of Virginia's life. Despite its limited amenities, the house's main attraction was the view of Porthminster Bay overlooking the Godrevy Lighthouse. The happy summers spent at Talland House would later influence Woolf's novels \"Jacob's Room\", \"To the Lighthouse\" and \"The Waves\".\nAt both Talland House and her family home, the family engaged with many literary and artistic figures. Frequent guests included literary figures such as Henry James, George Meredith, and James Russell Lowell. The family did not return after 1894; a hotel was constructed in front of the house which blocked the sea view, and Julia Stephen died in May the following year.\nSexual abuse.\nIn the 1939 essay \"A Sketch of the Past\", Woolf first disclosed that she had experienced sexual abuse by her half-brother, Gerald Duckworth, during childhood. There is speculation that this contributed to her mental health issues later in life. There are also suggestions of sexual impropriety from George Duckworth during the period that he was caring for the Stephen sisters when they were teenagers.\nAdolescence.\nHer mother's death precipitated what Virginia later identified as her first \"breakdown\"\u2014for months afterwards she was nervous and agitated, and she wrote very little for the subsequent two years.\nStella Duckworth took on a parental role in the household. She married in April 1897 but remained closely involved with the Stephens, moving to a house very close to the Stephens to continue to support the family. However, she fell ill on her honeymoon and died in July of that same year. After Stella's death, George Duckworth took on the role of head of the household, and sought to bring Vanessa and Virginia into society. However, this experience did not resonate with either sister. Virginia later reflected on this societal expectation, stating: \"Society in those days was a very competent, perfectly complacent, ruthless machine. A girl had no chance against its fangs. No other desires\u2014say to paint, or to write\u2014could be taken seriously.\" For Virginia, writing remained a priority. She began a new diary at the start of 1897 and filled notebooks with fragments and literary sketches.\nIn February 1904 Leslie Stephen died, which caused Virginia to suffer another period of mental instability, lasting from April to September. During this time she experienced a severe psychological crisis, which led to at least one suicide attempt. Woolf later described the period between 1897 and 1904 as \"the seven unhappy years\".\nEducation.\nAs was common at the time, Virginia's mother did not believe in formal education for her daughters. Instead, Virginia was educated in a piecemeal fashion by her parents. She also received piano lessons. Virginia had unrestricted access to her father's vast library, exposing her to much of the literary canon. This resulted in a greater depth of reading than any of her Cambridge contemporaries. She later recalled: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Even today there may be parents who would doubt the wisdom of allowing a girl of fifteen the free run of a large and quite unexpurgated library. But my father allowed it. There were certain facts \u2013 very briefly, very shyly he referred to them. Yet \"Read what you like\", he said, and all his books...were to be had without asking.\nBeginning in 1897, Virginia received private tutoring in Classical Greek and Latin. One of her tutors was Clara Pater, who was instrumental to her classical education, while another, Janet Case, became a lasting friend and introduced her to the suffrage movement. Virginia also attended lectures at the King's College Ladies' Department.\nAlthough Virginia could not attend Cambridge, she was profoundly influenced by her brother Thoby's experiences there. When Thoby went to Trinity in 1899 he became part of an intellectual circle of young men, including Clive Bell, Lytton Strachey, Leonard Woolf (whom Virginia would later marry), and Saxon Sydney-Turner. He introduced his sisters to this circle at the Trinity May Ball in 1900. This circle formed a reading group that they named the Midnight Society, to which the Stephen sisters would later be invited.\nBloomsbury (1904\u20131912).\nGordon Square.\nAfter their father's death, Vanessa and Adrian Stephen decided to sell their family home in South Kensington and move to Bloomsbury, a more affordable area. The Duckworth brothers did not join the Stephens in their new home; Gerald did not wish to, and George married and moved with his wife during the preparations. Virginia lived in the house for brief periods in the autumn\u00a0\u2013 she was sent away to Cambridge and Yorkshire for her health. She eventually settled there permanently in December 1904.\nFrom March 1905 the Stephens hosted gatherings with Thoby's intellectual friends at their home. Their social gatherings, referred to as \"Thursday evenings\", aimed to recreate the atmosphere at Trinity College. This circle formed the core of the intellectual circle of writers and artists known as the Bloomsbury Group. Later, it would include John Maynard Keynes, Duncan Grant, E. M. Forster, Roger Fry, and David Garnett. The group went on to gain notoriety for the \"Dreadnought\" hoax, in which they posed as a royal Abyssinian entourage. Among them, Virginia assumed the role of Prince Mendax.\nDuring this period, Virginia began teaching evening classes on a voluntary basis at Morley College and continued intermittently for the next two years. Her experience here would later influence themes of class and education in her novel \"Mrs Dalloway\". She also made some money from reviews, including some published in church paper \"The Guardian\" and the \"National Review\", capitalising on her father's literary reputation in order to earn commissions.\nVanessa added another event to their calendar with the \"Friday Club\", dedicated to the discussion of the fine arts. This gathering attracted some new members into their circle, including Henry Lamb, Gwen Darwin, and Katherine Laird (\"Ka\") Cox. Cox was to become Virginia's intimate friend. These new members brought the Bloomsbury Group into contact with another, slightly younger, group of Cambridge intellectuals whom Virginia would refer to as the \"Neo-Pagans\". The Friday Club continued until 1912 or 1913.\nIn the autumn of 1906, the siblings travelled to Greece and Turkey with Violet Dickinson. During the trip both Violet and Thoby contracted typhoid fever, which led to Thoby's death on 20 November of that year. Two days after Thoby's death, Vanessa accepted a previous proposal of marriage from Clive Bell. As a couple, their interest in avant-garde art would have an important influence on Virginia's further development as an author.\nFitzroy Square and Brunswick Square.\nAfter Vanessa's marriage, Virginia and Adrian moved into Fitzroy Square, still very close to Gordon Square. The new house had previously been occupied by George Bernard Shaw, and the area had been populated by artists since the previous century. Virginia resented the wealth that Vanessa's marriage had given her; Virginia and Adrian lived more humbly by comparison.\nThe siblings resumed the Thursday Club at their new home. During this period, the Bloomsbury group increasingly explored progressive ideas, with open discussions of sexuality. Virginia, however, appears not to have shown interest in practising the group's ideologies, finding an outlet for her sexual desires only in writing. Around this time she began work on her first novel, \"Melymbrosia\", which eventually became \"The Voyage Out\" (1915). In 1907, Woolf also wrote her first mock-biographical set of three interconnected comic stories chronicling the adventures of a giantess named Violet, titled \"The Life of Violet\", after Violet Dickinson, her first completed experiment in literary parody and biographical writing, anticipating her later experiments in prose.\nIn November 1911 Virginia and Adrian moved to a larger house in Brunswick Square, and invited John Maynard Keynes, Duncan Grant and Leonard Woolf to become lodgers there. Virginia saw it as a new opportunity: \"We are going to try all kinds of experiments\", she told Ottoline Morrell.\nAsham House (1911\u20131919).\nDuring the later Bloomsbury years, Virginia travelled frequently with friends and family, to Dorset, Cornwall, and farther afield to Paris, Italy and Bayreuth. These trips were intended to prevent her from suffering exhaustion due to extended periods in London. The question arose of her needing a quiet country retreat close to London to support her still-fragile mental health. In the winter of 1910 she and Adrian stayed at Lewes and started exploring Sussex's surrounding area. She soon found a property in nearby Firle, which she named \"Little Talland House\"; she maintained a relationship with that region for the rest of her life, spending her time either in Sussex or London.\nIn September 1911 she and Leonard Woolf found Asham House nearby, and she and Vanessa took a joint lease on it. Located at the end of a tree-lined road, the house was in a Regency-Gothic style, \"flat, pale, serene, yellow-washed\", remote, without electricity or water and allegedly haunted. The sisters had two housewarming parties in January 1912.\nVirginia recorded the weekends and holidays she spent there in her Asham Diary, part of which was later published as \"A Writer's Diary\" in 1953. Creatively, \"The Voyage Out\" was completed there, as was much of \"Night and Day\". The house itself inspired the short story \"A Haunted House\", published in \"A Haunted House and Other Short Stories\". Asham provided Virginia with much-needed relief from the London's fast-paced life and was where she found happiness that she expressed in her diary on 5 May 1919: \"Oh, but how happy we've been at Asheham! It was a most melodious time. Everything went so freely; \u2013 but I can't analyse all the sources of my joy\".\nWhile at Asham, in 1916 Leonard and Virginia found a farmhouse about four miles away that they thought would be ideal for her sister. Eventually, Vanessa visited to inspect it, and took possession in October of that year, establishing it as a summer home for her family. The Charleston Farmhouse was to become the summer gathering place for the Bloomsbury Group.\nMarriage and war (1912\u20131920).\nLeonard Woolf was one of Thoby Stephen's friends at Trinity College, Cambridge, and had encountered the Stephen sisters in Thoby's rooms while visiting for May Week between 1899 and 1904. He recalled that in \"white dresses and large hats, with parasols in their hands, their beauty literally took one's breath away\". In 1904 Leonard left Britain for a civil service position in Ceylon, but returned for a year's leave in 1911 after letters from Lytton Strachey, describing Virginia's beauty, enticed him back. He and Virginia attended social engagements together, and he moved into Brunswick Square as a tenant in December of that year.\nLeonard proposed to Virginia on 11 January 1912. Initially she expressed reluctance, but the two continued courting. Leonard decided not to return to Ceylon and resigned from his post. On 29 May Virginia declared her love for Leonard, and they married on 10 August at St Pancras Town Hall. The couple spent their honeymoon first at Asham and the Quantock Hills before travelling to the south of France, Spain and Italy. Upon returning, they moved to Clifford's Inn, and began to divide their time between London and Asham. Though Virginia wanted to have children, Leonard refused, as he believed Virginia was not mentally strong enough to be a mother, and worried that having children might worsen her mental health.\nVirginia had completed a penultimate draft of her first novel \"The Voyage Out\" before her wedding but made large-scale alterations to the manuscript between December 1912 and March 1913. The work was later accepted by her half-brother Gerald Duckworth's publishing house, and she found the process of reading and correcting the proofs extremely emotionally difficult. This led to one of several breakdowns over the next two years; Virginia attempted suicide on 9 September 1913 with an overdose of Veronal, being saved with the help of surgeon Geoffrey Keynes. Virginia's illness led to Duckworth delaying the publication of \"The Voyage Out\" until 26 March 1915.\nIn the autumn of 1914 the couple moved to a house on Richmond Green. In late March 1915 they moved to Hogarth House, after which they named their publishing house in 1917. The decision to move to London's suburbs was made for the sake of Virginia's health. Many of Virginia's friends were against the war, and Virginia herself opposed it from a standpoint of pacifism and anti-censorship. Leonard was exempted from the introduction of conscription in 1916 on medical grounds. The Woolfs employed two servants at the recommendation of Roger Fry in 1916; Lottie Hope worked for some other Bloomsbury Group members, and Nellie Boxall would stay with them until 1934.\nThe Woolfs spent parts of the World War I era in Asham but were obliged by the owner to leave in 1919. \"In despair\" they purchased the Round House in Lewes. No sooner had they bought the Round House, than Monk's House in nearby Rodmell came up for auction, a weatherboarded house with oak-beamed rooms, said to date from the 15th or 16th century. The Woolfs sold the Round House and purchased Monk's House for \u00a3700. Monk's House also lacked running water but came with an acre of garden, and had a view across the Ouse towards the hills of the South Downs. Leonard Woolf describes this view as being unchanged since the days of Chaucer. The Woolfs would retain Monk's House until the end of Virginia's life; it became their permanent home after their London home was bombed, and it was where she completed \"Between the Acts\" in early 1941, which was followed by her final breakdown and suicide in the nearby River Ouse on 28 March.\nFurther works (1920\u20131940).\nMemoir Club.\n1920 saw a postwar reconstitution of the Bloomsbury Group, under the title of the Memoir Club, which as the name suggests focussed on self-writing, in the manner of Proust's \"A La Recherche\", and inspired some of the more influential books of the 20th century. The Group, which had been scattered by the war, was reconvened by Mary ('Molly') MacCarthy who called them \"Bloomsberries\", and operated under rules derived from the Cambridge Apostles, an elite university debating society of which some of them had been members. These rules emphasised candour and openness. Among the 125 memoirs presented, Virginia contributed three that were published posthumously in 1976, in the autobiographical anthology \"Moments of Being\". These were \"22 Hyde Park Gate\" (1921), \"Old Bloomsbury\" (1922) and \"Am I a Snob?\" (1936).\nVita Sackville-West.\nOn 14 December 1922 Woolf met the writer and gardener Vita Sackville-West, wife of Harold Nicolson. This period was to prove fruitful for both authors, Woolf producing three novels, \"To the Lighthouse\" (1927), \"Orlando\" (1928), and \"The Waves\" (1931) as well as a number of essays, including \"Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown\" (1924) and \"A Letter to a Young Poet\" (1932). The two women remained friends until Woolf's death in 1941.\nVirginia Woolf also remained close to her surviving siblings, Adrian and Vanessa.\nFurther novels and non-fiction.\nBetween 1924 and 1940 the Woolfs returned to Bloomsbury, taking out a ten-year lease at 52 Tavistock Square, from where they ran the Hogarth Press from the basement, where Virginia also had her writing room.\n1925 saw the publication of \"Mrs Dalloway\" in May followed by her collapse while at Charleston in August. In 1927, her next novel, \"To the Lighthouse\", was published, and the following year she lectured on \"Women &amp; Fiction\" at Cambridge University and published \"Orlando\" in October.\nHer two Cambridge lectures then became the basis for her major essay \"A Room of One's Own\" in 1929. Virginia wrote only one drama, \"Freshwater\", based on her great-aunt Julia Margaret Cameron, and produced at her sister's studio on Fitzroy Street in 1935. 1936 saw the publication of \"The Years\", which had its origin in a lecture Woolf gave to the National Society for Women's Service in 1931, an edited version of which would later be published as \"Professions for Women\". Another collapse of her health followed the novel's completion \"The Years\".\nThe Woolfs' final residence in London was at 37 Mecklenburgh Square (1939\u20131940), destroyed during the Blitz in September 1940; a month later their previous home on Tavistock Square was also destroyed. After that, they made Sussex their permanent home.\nDeath.\nAfter completing the manuscript of her last novel (posthumously published), \"Between the Acts\" (1941), Woolf fell into a depression similar to one that she had earlier experienced. The onset of the Second World War, the destruction of her London home during the Blitz, and the cold reception given to of her late friend Roger Fry all worsened her condition until she was unable to work. When Leonard enlisted in the Home Guard, Virginia disapproved. She held fast to her pacifism and criticised her husband for wearing what she considered to be \"the silly uniform of the Home Guard\".\nAfter the Second World War began, Woolf's diary indicates that she was obsessed with death, which figured more and more as her mood darkened. On 28 March 1941, Woolf drowned herself by walking into the fast-flowing River Ouse near her home, after placing a large stone in her pocket. Her body was not found until 18 April. Her husband buried her cremated remains beneath an elm tree in the garden of Monk's House, their home in Rodmell, Sussex.\nIn her suicide note, addressed to her husband, she wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Dearest,\nI feel certain that I am going mad again. I feel we can't go through another of those terrible times. And I shan't recover this time. I begin to hear voices, and I can't concentrate. So I am doing what seems the best thing to do. You have given me the greatest possible happiness. You have been in every way all that anyone could be. I don't think two people could have been happier till this terrible disease came. I can't fight it any longer. I know that I am spoiling your life, that without me you could work. And you will I know. You see I can't even write this properly. I can't read. What I want to say is I owe all the happiness of my life to you. You have been entirely patient with me and incredibly good. I want to say that\u2014everybody knows it. If anybody could have saved me it would have been you. Everything has gone from me but the certainty of your goodness. I can't go on spoiling your life any longer. I don't think two people could have been happier than we have been. V.\nMental health.\nMuch examination has been made of Woolf's mental health. From the age of 13, following the death of her mother, Woolf suffered periodic mood swings. However, Hermione Lee asserts that Woolf was not \"mad\"; she was merely a woman who suffered from and struggled with illness for much of her life, a woman of \"exceptional courage, intelligence and stoicism\", who made the best use, and achieved the best understanding she could, of that illness. Writer and social anthropologist Camille Caprioglio suggests that Woolf may have been autistic, a possible contributing factor to her mental health struggles. \nHer mother's death in 1895, \"the greatest disaster that could happen\", precipitated a crisis for which their family doctor, Dr. Seton, prescribed rest, stopping lessons and writing, and regular walks supervised by Stella. Yet just two years later, Stella too was dead, bringing on Virginia's first expressed wish for death at the age of 15. This was a scenario she would later recreate in \"Time Passes\" (\"To the Lighthouse\", 1927).\nThe death of her father in 1904 provoked her most alarming collapse, on 10 May, when she threw herself out of a window and she was briefly institutionalised under the care of her father's friend, the eminent psychiatrist George Savage. She spent time recovering at the house of Stella's friend Violet Dickinson, and at her aunt Caroline Stephen's house in Cambridge, and by January 1905, Savage considered her cured.\nHer brother Thoby's death in 1906 marked a \"decade of deaths\" that ended her childhood and adolescence.\nOn Savage's recommendation, Virginia spent three short periods in 1910, 1912, and 1913 at Burley House at 15 Cambridge Park, Twickenham, described as \"a private nursing home for women with nervous disorder\" run by Miss Jean Thomas. By the end of February 1910, she was becoming increasingly restless, and Savage suggested being away from London. Vanessa rented Moat House, outside Canterbury, in June, but there was no improvement, so Savage sent her to Burley for a \"rest cure\". This involved partial isolation, deprivation of literature, and force-feeding, and after six weeks she was able to convalesce in Cornwall and Dorset during the autumn.\nShe loathed the experience; writing to her sister on 28 July, she described how she found the religious atmosphere stifling and the institution ugly, and informed Vanessa that to escape \"I shall soon have to jump out of a window\". The threat of being sent back would later lead to her contemplating suicide. Despite her protests, Savage would refer her back in 1912 for insomnia and in 1913 for depression.\nOn emerging from Burley House in September 1913, she sought further opinions from two other physicians on the 13th: Maurice Wright, and Henry Head, who had been Henry James's physician. Both recommended she return to Burley House. Distraught, she returned home and attempted suicide by taking an overdose of 100 grains of veronal (a barbiturate) and nearly dying.\nOn recovery, she went to Dalingridge Hall, George Duckworth's home in East Grinstead, Sussex, to convalesce on 30 September, returning to \"Asham\" on 18 November. She remained unstable over the next two years, with another incident involving veronal that she claimed was an 'accident', and consulted another psychiatrist in April 1914, Maurice Craig, who explained that she was not sufficiently psychotic to be certified or committed to an institution.\nThe rest of the summer of 1914 went better for her, and they moved to Richmond, but in February 1915, just as \"The Voyage Out\" was due to be published, she relapsed once more, and remained in poor health for most of that year. Then she began to recover, following 20 years of ill health. Nevertheless, there was a feeling among those around her that she was now permanently changed, and not for the better.\nOver the rest of her life, she suffered recurrent bouts of depression. In 1940, a number of factors appeared to overwhelm her. Her biography of Roger Fry had been published in July, and she had been disappointed in its reception. The horrors of war depressed her, and their London homes had been destroyed in the Blitz in September and October. Woolf had completed \"Between the Acts\" (published posthumously in 1941) in November, and completing a novel was frequently accompanied by exhaustion. Her health became increasingly a matter of concern, culminating in her decision to end her life on 28 March 1941.\nShe also suffered many physical ailments such as headaches, backache, fevers and faints, which related closely to her psychological stress. These often lasted for weeks or even months, and impeded her work: \"What a gap! ... for 60 days; &amp; those days spent in wearisome headache, jumping pulse, aching back, frets, fidgets, lying awake, sleeping draughts, sedatives, digitalis, going for a little walk, &amp; plunging back into bed again.\"\nThough this instability would frequently affect her social life, she was able to continue her literary productivity with few interruptions throughout her life. Woolf herself provides not only a vivid picture of her symptoms in her diaries and letters but also her response to the demons that haunted her and at times made her long for death: \"But it is always a question whether I wish to avoid these glooms... These 9 weeks give one a plunge into deep waters... One goes down into the well &amp; nothing protects one from the assault of truth.\"\nPsychiatry had little to offer Woolf, but she recognised that writing was one of the behaviours that enabled her to cope with her illness: \"The only way I keep afloat... is by working... Directly I stop working I feel that I am sinking down, down. And as usual, I feel that if I sink further I shall reach the truth.\" Sinking underwater was Woolf's metaphor for both the effects of depression and psychosis\u2014 but also for finding the truth, and ultimately was her choice of death.\nThroughout her life, Woolf struggled, without success, to find meaning in her illness: on the one hand, an impediment, on the other, something she visualised as an essential part of who she was, and a necessary condition of her art. Her experiences informed her work, such as the character of Septimus Warren Smith in \"Mrs Dalloway\" (1925), who, like Woolf, was haunted by the dead, and ultimately takes his own life rather than be admitted to a sanatorium.\nLeonard Woolf relates how during the 30 years they were married, they consulted many doctors in the Harley Street area, and although they were given a diagnosis of neurasthenia, he felt they had little understanding of the causes or nature. The proposed solution was simple\u2014as long as she lived a quiet life without any physical or mental exertion, she was well. In contrast, any mental, emotional, or physical strain resulted in a reappearance of her symptoms, beginning with a headache, followed by insomnia and thoughts that started to race. Her remedy was simple: to retire to bed in a darkened room, following which the symptoms slowly subsided.\nModern scholars, including her nephew and biographer, Quentin Bell, have suggested her breakdowns and subsequent recurring depressive periods were influenced by the sexual abuse to which she and her sister Vanessa were subjected by their half-brothers George and Gerald Duckworth (which Woolf recalls in her autobiographical essays \"A Sketch of the Past\" and \"22 Hyde Park Gate\"). Biographers point out that when Stella died in 1897, there was no counterbalance to control George's predation, and his nighttime prowling. \"22 Hyde Park Gate\" ends with the sentence \"The old ladies of Kensington and Belgravia never knew that George Duckworth was not only father and mother, brother and sister to those poor Stephen girls; he was their lover also.\"\nIt is likely that other factors also played a part. It has been suggested that they include genetic predisposition. Virginia's father, Leslie Stephen, suffered from depression, and her half-sister Laura was institutionalised. Many of Virginia's symptoms, including persistent headache, insomnia, irritability, and anxiety, resembled those of her father's. Another factor is the pressure she placed upon herself in her work; for instance, her breakdown of 1913 was at least partly triggered by the need to finish \"The Voyage Out\".\nVirginia herself hinted that her illness was related to how she saw the repressed position of women in society when she wrote \"A Room of One's Own\". in a 1930 letter to Ethel Smyth:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As an experience, madness is terrific I can assure you, and not to be sniffed at; and in its lava I still find most of the things I write about. It shoots out of one everything shaped, final, not in mere driblets, as sanity does. And the six months\u2014not three\u2014that I lay in bed taught me a good deal about what is called oneself.\nThomas Caramagno and others, in discussing her illness, oppose the \"neurotic-genius\" way of looking at mental illness, where creativity and mental illness are conceptualised as linked rather than antithetical. Stephen Trombley describes Woolf as having a confrontational relationship with her doctors, and possibly being a woman who is a \"victim of male medicine\", referring to the lack of understanding, particularly at the time, about mental illness.\nSexuality.\nThe Bloomsbury Group held very progressive views of sexuality and rejected the austere strictness of Victorian society. The majority of its members were homosexual or bisexual.\nWoolf had several affairs with women, the most notable being with Vita Sackville-West. The two women developed a deep connection; Vita was arguably one of the few people in Virginia's adult life that she was truly close to.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[Virginia Woolf] told Ethel that she only really loved three people: Leonard, Vanessa, and myself, which annoyed Ethel but pleased me.\u2014\u200a\nDuring their relationship, both women saw the peak of their literary careers, with the titular protagonist of Woolf's acclaimed \"\" being inspired by Sackville-West. The pair remained lovers for a decade and stayed close friends for the rest of Woolf's life. Woolf had said to Sackville-West she disliked masculinity.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[Virginia Woolf] dislikes the possessiveness and love of domination in men. In fact, she dislikes the quality of masculinity\u00a0 says that women stimulate her imagination, by their grace &amp; their art of life.\u2014\u200a\nAmong her other notable affairs were those with Sibyl Colefax, Lady Ottoline Morrell, and Mary Hutchinson. Some surmise that she fell in love with Madge Symonds, the wife of one of her uncles. Madge Symonds was described as one of Woolf's early loves in Sackville-West's diary. She also fell in love with Violet Dickinson, although there is some confusion as to whether the two consummated their relationship.\nVirginia initially declined marriage proposals from her future husband, Leonard. She even went so far as to tell him that she was not physically attracted to him, but later declared that she did love him, and eventually agreed to marriage. Woolf preferred female lovers to male lovers and did not seem to be sexually attracted to men.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I sometimes think that if I married you, I could have everything\u2014and then\u2014is it the sexual side of it that comes between us? As I told you brutally the other day, I feel no physical attraction in you.\u2014\u200a\nLeonard became the love of her life. Although their sexual relationship was questionable, they loved each other deeply and formed a strong and supportive marriage that led to the formation of their publishing house as well as several of her writings. Though Virginia had affairs with and attractions to women during their marriage, she and Leonard maintained a mutual love and respect.\nWork.\nWoolf is considered to be one of the most important 20th-century novelists. A modernist, she was one of the pioneers of using stream of consciousness as a narrative device, alongside contemporaries such as Marcel Proust, Dorothy Richardson and James Joyce. Woolf's reputation was at its greatest during the 1930s, but declined considerably following the Second World War. The growth of feminist criticism in the 1970s helped re-establish her reputation.\nVirginia submitted her first article in 1890, to a competition in \"Tit-Bits\". Although it was rejected, this shipboard romance by the eight-year-old would presage her first novel 25 years later, as would contributions to the \"Hyde Park News\", such as the model letter \"to show young people the right way to express what is in their hearts\", a subtle commentary on her mother's legendary matchmaking. She transitioned from juvenilia to professional journalism in 1904 at the age of 22. Violet Dickinson introduced her to Kathleen Lyttelton, the editor of the \"Women's Supplement\" of \"The Guardian\", a Church of England newspaper. Invited to submit a 1,500-word article, Virginia sent Lyttelton a review of William Dean Howells' \"The Son of Royal Langbirth\" and an essay about her visit to Haworth that year, \"Haworth, November 1904\". The review was published anonymously on 4 December, and the essay on the 21st. In 1905, Woolf began writing for \"The Times Literary Supplement\" (TLS); in 2019, the \"TLS\" would publish a collection of her essays entitled \"Genius and Ink: Virginia Woolf on How to Read\", which originally appeared anonymously, as did all their reviews.\nWoolf went on to publish novels and essays as a public intellectual to both critical and popular acclaim. Much of her work was self-published through the Hogarth Press. \"Virginia Woolf's peculiarities as a fiction writer have tended to obscure her central strength: she is arguably the major lyrical novelist in the English language. Her novels are highly experimental: a narrative, frequently uneventful and commonplace, is refracted\u2014and sometimes almost dissolved\u2014in the characters' receptive consciousness. Intense lyricism and stylistic virtuosity fuse to create a world overabundant with auditory and visual impressions.\" \"The intensity of Virginia Woolf's poetic vision elevates the ordinary, sometimes banal settings\"\u2014often wartime environments\u2014\"of most of her novels.\"\nThough at least one biography of Virginia Woolf appeared in her lifetime, the first authoritative study of her life was published in 1972 by her nephew Quentin Bell. Hermione Lee's 1996 biography \"Virginia Woolf\" provides a thorough and authoritative examination of Woolf's life and work, which she discussed in an interview in 1997. In 2001, Louise DeSalvo and Mitchell A. Leaska edited \"The Letters of Vita Sackville-West and Virginia Woolf\". Julia Briggs's \"Virginia Woolf: An Inner Life\" (2005) focuses on Woolf's writing, including her novels and her commentary on the creative process, to illuminate her life. The sociologist Pierre Bourdieu also uses Woolf's literature to understand and analyse gender domination. Woolf biographer Gillian Gill notes that Woolf's traumatic experience of sexual abuse by her half-brothers during her childhood influenced her advocacy for the protection of vulnerable children from similar experiences. Biljana Doj\u010dinovi\u0107 has discussed the issues surrounding translations of Woolf to Serbian as a \"border-crossing\".\nThemes.\nWoolf's fiction has been studied for its insight into many themes including war, shell shock, witchcraft, and the role of social class in contemporary modern British society. In the postwar \"Mrs Dalloway\" (1925), Woolf addresses the moral dilemma of war and its effects and provides an authentic voice for soldiers returning from the First World War, suffering from shell shock, in the person of Septimus Smith. In \"A Room of One's Own\" (1929) Woolf equates historical accusations of witchcraft with creativity and genius among women \"When, however, one reads of a witch being ducked, of a woman possessed by devils...then I think we are on the track of a lost novelist, a suppressed poet, of some mute and inglorious Jane Austen\". Throughout her work Woolf tried to evaluate the degree to which her privileged background framed the lens through which she viewed class. She examined her own position as someone who would be considered an elitist snob but attacked the class structure of Britain as she found it. In her 1936 essay \"Am I a Snob?\" she examined her values and those of the privileged circle she existed in. She concluded she was, and subsequent critics and supporters have tried to deal with the dilemma of being both elite and a social critic.\nThe sea is a recurring motif in Woolf's work. Noting Woolf's early memory of listening to waves break in Cornwall, Katharine Smyth writes in \"The Paris Review\" that \"the radiance [of] cresting water would be consecrated again and again in her writing, saturating not only essays, diaries, and letters but also \"Jacob's Room\", \"The Waves\", and \"To the Lighthouse\".\" Patrizia A. Muscogiuri explains that \"seascapes, sailing, diving and the sea itself are aspects of nature and of human beings' relationship with it which frequently inspired Virginia Woolf's writing.\" This trope is deeply embedded in her texts' structure and grammar; James Antoniou notes in \"Sydney Morning Herald\" how \"Woolf made a virtue of the semicolon, the shape and function of which resembles the wave, her most famous motif.\"\nDespite the considerable conceptual difficulties, given Woolf's idiosyncratic use of language, her works have been translated into over 50 languages. Some writers, such as the Belgian Marguerite Yourcenar, had rather tense encounters with her, while others, such as the Argentinian Jorge Luis Borges, produced versions that were highly controversial.\nDrama.\nVirginia Woolf researched the life of her great-aunt, the photographer Julia Margaret Cameron, publishing her findings in an essay titled \"Pattledom\" (1925), and later in her introduction to her 1926 edition of Cameron's photographs. She had begun work on a play based on an episode in Cameron's life in 1923 but abandoned it. Finally, it was performed on 18 January 1935 at the studio of her sister, Vanessa Bell on Fitzroy Street in 1935. Woolf directed it herself, and the cast were mainly members of the Bloomsbury Group, including herself. \"Freshwater\" is a short three act comedy satirising the Victorian era, only performed once in Woolf's lifetime. Beneath the comedic elements, there is an exploration of both generational change and artistic freedom. Both Cameron and Woolf fought against the class and gender dynamics of Victorianism and the play shows links to both \"To the Lighthouse\" and \"A Room of One's Own\" that would follow.\nNon-fiction.\nWoolf wrote a body of autobiographical work and more than 500 essays and reviews, some of which, like \"A Room of One's Own\" (1929) were of book-length. Not all were published in her lifetime. Shortly after her death, Leonard Woolf produced an edited edition of unpublished essays titled \"The Moment and other Essays\", published by the Hogarth Press in 1947. Many of these were originally lectures that she gave, and several more volumes of essays followed, such as \"The Captain's Death Bed: and other essays\" (1950).\n\"A Room of One's Own\".\nAmong Woolf's non-fiction works, one of the best known is \"A Room of One's Own\" (1929), a book-length essay divided into six chapters. Considered a key work of feminist literary criticism, it was written following two lectures she delivered on \"Women and Fiction\" at Cambridge University the previous year. In it, she examines the historical disempowerment women have faced in many spheres, including social, educational and financial. One of her more famous dicta is contained within the book \"A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction\". Much of her argument (\"to show you how I arrived at this opinion about the room and the money\") is developed through the \"unsolved problems\" of women and fiction writing to arrive at her conclusion, although she claimed that was only \"an opinion upon one minor point\". In doing so, she states a good deal about the nature of women and fiction, employing a quasi-fictional style as she examines where women writers failed because of lack of resources and opportunities, examining along the way the experiences of the Bront\u00ebs, George Eliot and George Sand, as well as the fictional character of Shakespeare's sister, equipped with the same genius but not position. She contrasts these women who accepted a deferential status with Jane Austen, who wrote entirely as a woman.\nHogarth Press.\nVirginia had taken up book-binding as a pastime in October 1901, at the age of 19. The Woolfs had been discussing setting up a publishing house for some time\u00a0\u2013 Leonard intended for it to give Virginia a rest from the strain of writing, and thereby help her fragile mental health. Additionally, publishing her works under their own outfit would save her from the stress of submitting her work to an external company, which contributed to her breakdown during the process of publishing her first novel \"The Voyage Out\". The Woolfs obtained their own hand-printing press in April 1917 and set it up on their dining room table at Hogarth House, thus beginning the Hogarth Press.\nThe first publication was \"Two Stories\" in July 1917, consisting of \"The Mark on the Wall\" by Virginia Woolf (which has been described as \"Woolf's first foray into modernism\") and \"Three Jews\" by Leonard Woolf. The accompanying illustrations by Dora Carrington were a success, leading Virginia to remark that the press was \"specially good at printing pictures, and we see that we must make a practice of always having pictures.\" The process took two and a half months with a production run of 150 copies. Other short stories followed, including \"Kew Gardens\" (1919) with a woodblock by Vanessa Bell as frontispiece. Subsequently, Bell added further illustrations, adorning each page of the text.\nUnlike its contemporary small printers, who specialised in expensive artisanal reprints, the Woolfs concentrated on living avant-garde authors, and over the subsequent five years printed works by authors including Katherine Mansfield, T.S. Eliot, E. M. Forster, Clive Bell and Roger Fry. They also produced translations of Russian works with S. S. Koteliansky, and the first translation of the complete works of Sigmund Freud. They acquired a larger press in 1921 and began to sell directly to booksellers. In 1938 Virginia sold her share of the company to John Lehmann, who had started working for Hogarth Press seven years previously. The Press eventually became Leonard's only source of income, but his association with it ended in 1946, after publishing 527 titles, and Hogarth is now an imprint of Penguin Random House.\nThe Press also produced explicitly political works. Pamphlets had fallen out of fashion due to the high production costs and low revenue, but the Hogarth Press produced several series on contemporary issues of international politics, challenging colonialism and critiquing Soviet Russia and Italian fascism. The Woolfs also published political fiction, including \"Turbott Wolfe\" (1926) by William Plomer and \"In a Province\" (1934) by Laurens van der Post, which concern South African racial policies and revolutionary movements respectively. Virginia Woolf saw a link between international politics and feminism, publishing a biography of Indian feminist activist Saroj Nalini Dutt and the memoirs of suffragette Elizabeth Robins. Scholar Ursula McTaggart argues that the Hogarth Press shaped and represented Woolf's later concept of an \"Outsiders' Society\", a non-organised group of women who would resist \"the patriarchal fascism of war and nationalism\" by exerting influence through private actions, as described in \"Three Guineas\". In this view, the readers and authors form a loose network, with the Press providing the means to exchange ideas.\nInfluences.\nSybil Oldfield examines Woolf's convinced pacifism, its sources and its expression in her life and works.\nMichel Lackey argues that a major influence on Woolf, from 1912 onward, was Russian literature and Woolf adopted many of its aesthetic conventions. The style of Fyodor Dostoyevsky with his depiction of a fluid mind in operation helped to influence Woolf's writings about a \"discontinuous writing process\", though Woolf objected to Dostoyevsky's obsession with \"psychological extremity\" and the \"tumultuous flux of emotions\" in his characters together with his right-wing, monarchist politics as Dostoyevsky was an ardent supporter of the autocracy of the Russian Empire. In contrast to her objections to Dostoyevsky's \"exaggerated emotional pitch\", Woolf found much to admire in the work of Anton Chekhov and Leo Tolstoy. Woolf admired Chekhov for his stories of ordinary people living their lives, doing banal things and plots that had no neat endings. From Tolstoy, Woolf drew lessons about how a novelist should depict a character's psychological state and the interior tension within. Lackey notes that, from Ivan Turgenev, Woolf drew the lessons that there are multiple \"I's\" when writing a novel, and the novelist needed to balance those multiple versions of him- or herself to balance the \"mundane facts\" of a story vs. the writer's overarching vision, which required a \"total passion\" for art.\nThe American writer Henry David Thoreau also influenced Woolf. In a 1917 essay, she praised Thoreau for his statement \"The millions are awake enough for physical labor, but only one in hundreds of millions is awake enough to a poetic or divine life. To be awake is to be alive.\" They both aimed to capture 'the moment'\u2013\u2013as Walter Pater says, \"to burn always with this hard, gem-like flame.\" Woolf praised Thoreau for his \"simplicity\" in finding \"a way for setting free the delicate and complicated machinery of the soul\". Like Thoreau, Woolf believed that it was silence that set the mind free to really contemplate and understand the world. Both authors believed in a certain transcendental, mystical approach to life and writing, where even banal things could be capable of generating deep emotions if one had enough silence and the presence of mind to appreciate them. Woolf and Thoreau were both concerned with the difficulty of human relationships in the modern age.\nWoolf's preface to credits Daniel Defoe, Sir Thomas Browne, Laurence Sterne, Sir Walter Scott, Lord Macaulay, Emily Bront\u00eb, Thomas de Quincey, and Walter Pater as influences. Among her contemporaries, Woolf was influenced by Marcel Proust, writing to Roger Fry, \"Oh if I could write like that!\"\nVirginia Woolf and her mother.\nThe intense scrutiny of Virginia Woolf's literary output has led to speculation as to her mother's influence, including psychoanalytic studies of mother and daughter. Her memories of her mother are memories of an obsession, starting with her first major breakdown on her mother's death in 1895, the loss having a profound lifelong effect. In many ways, her mother's profound influence on Virginia Woolf is conveyed in the latter's recollections, \"there she is; beautiful, emphatic ... closer than any of the living are, lighting our random lives as with a burning torch, infinitely noble and delightful to her children\".\nWoolf's understanding of her mother and family evolved considerably between 1907 and 1940, in which the somewhat distant, yet revered figure, becomes more nuanced and complete. She described her mother as an \"invisible presence\" in her life, and Ellen Rosenman argues that the mother-daughter relationship is a constant in Woolf's writing. She describes how Woolf's modernism needs to be viewed in relationship to her ambivalence towards her Victorian mother, the centre of the former's female identity, and her voyage to her own sense of autonomy. To Woolf, \"Saint Julia\" was both a martyr whose perfectionism was intimidating and a source of deprivation, by her absences real and virtual and premature death. Julia's influence and memory pervade Woolf's life and work. \"She has haunted me\", she wrote.\nHistorical feminism.\nAccording to the 2007 book \"Feminism: From Mary Wollstonecraft to Betty Friedan\" by Bhaskar A. Shukla, \"Recently, studies of Virginia Woolf have focused on feminist and lesbian themes in her work, such as in the 1997 collection of critical essays, \"Virginia Woolf: Lesbian Readings\", edited by Eileen Barrett and Patricia Cramer.\" In 1928, Woolf took a grassroots approach to informing and inspiring feminism. She addressed undergraduate women at the ODTAA Society at Girton College, Cambridge, and the Arts Society at Newnham College, with two papers that eventually became \"A Room of One's Own\" (1929).\nWoolf's best-known nonfiction works, \"A Room of One's Own\" (1929) and \"Three Guineas\" (1938), examine the difficulties that female writers and intellectuals faced because men held disproportionate legal and economic power, as well as the future of women in education and society. In \"The Second Sex\" (1949), Simone de Beauvoir counts, of all women who ever lived, only three female writers\u2014Emily Bront\u00eb, Woolf and \"sometimes\" Katherine Mansfield\u2014who have explored \"the given\".\nViews.\nIn her lifetime, Woolf was outspoken on many topics that were considered controversial, some of which are now considered progressive, others regressive. She was an ardent feminist at a time when women's rights were barely recognised, and anti-colonialist, anti-imperialist, anti-militarist and a pacifist when chauvinism was popular. On the other hand, she has been criticised for her views on class and race in her private writings and published works. Like many of her contemporaries, some of her writing is now considered offensive. As a result, she is considered polarising, a revolutionary feminist and socialist hero or a purveyor of hate speech.\nWorks such as \"A Room of One's Own\" (1929) and \"Three Guineas\" (1938) are frequently taught as icons of feminist literature in courses that would be very critical of some of her views expressed elsewhere. She has also been the recipient of considerable homophobic and misogynist criticism.\nHumanist views.\nVirginia Woolf was born into a non-religious family and is regarded, along with fellow members of the Bloomsbury group E. M. Forster and G. E. Moore, as a humanist. Both her parents were prominent agnostic atheists although a significant influence was her aunt Caroline Stephen. Caroline Stephen was a convert to Quakerism, the Religious Society of Friends, and was a strong English exponent for its peace testimony in 1890. Her father, Leslie Stephen, had become famous in polite society for his writings which expressed and publicised reasons to doubt the veracity of religion and abhorred military service. Stephen was also President of the West London Ethical Society, an early humanist organisation, and helped to found the Union of Ethical Societies in 1896. Woolf's mother, Julia Stephen, wrote the book \"Agnostic Women\" (1880), which argued that agnosticism (defined here as something more like atheism) could be a highly moral approach to life.\nWoolf was a critic of Christianity. In a letter to Ethel Smyth, she gave a scathing denunciation of the religion, seeing it as self-righteous \"egotism\" and stating \"my Jew [Leonard] has more religion in one toenail\u2014more human love, in one hair\". Woolf stated in her private letters that she thought of herself as an atheist.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;She thought there were no Gods; no one was to blame; and so she evolved this atheist's religion of doing good for the sake of goodness.\u2014\u200a\nControversies.\nHermione Lee cites a number of extracts from Woolf's writings that many, including Lee, would consider offensive, and these criticisms can be traced back as far as those of Wyndham Lewis and Q. D. Leavis in the 1920s and 1930s. Other authors provide more nuanced contextual interpretations and stress the complexity of her character and the apparent inherent contradictions in analysing her apparent flaws. She could certainly be off-hand, rude and even cruel in her dealings with other authors, translators and biographers, such as her treatment of Ruth Gruber. Some authors, including David Daiches, Brenda Silver, Alison Light and other postcolonial feminists, dismiss her (and modernist authors in general) as privileged, elitist, classist, racist, and antisemitic.\nWoolf's tendentious expressions, including prejudicial feelings against disabled people, have often been the topic of academic criticism:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The first quotation is from a diary entry of September 1920 and runs: \"The fact is the lower classes are detestable.\" The remainder follow the first in reproducing stereotypes standard to upper-class and upper-middle class life in the early 20th century: \"imbeciles should certainly be killed\"; \"Jews\" are greasy; a \"crowd\" is both an ontological \"mass\" and is, again, \"detestable\"; \"Germans\" are akin to vermin; some \"baboon faced intellectuals\" mix with \"sad green dressed negroes and negresses, looking like chimpanzees\" at a peace conference; Kensington High St. revolts one's stomach with its innumerable \"women of incredible mediocrity, drab as dishwater\".\nAntisemitism.\nWoolf has often been accused of antisemitism. Despite being happily married to an irreligious Jewish man (Leonard Woolf) who had no connection with or knowledge of his people, she generally characterised Jewish characters with negative stereotypes. For instance, she described some of the Jewish characters in her work in terms that suggested they were physically repulsive or dirty. She also expressed derogatory views in private, writing in a 1930 letter to friend Ethyl Smith, \"How I hated marrying a Jew \u2014 how I hated their nasal voices and their oriental jewellery, and their noses and their wattles \u2014 what a snob I was: for they have immense vitality, and I think I like that quality best of all\" (Letter to Ethel Smyth, 1930).\nWhile travelling on a cruise to Portugal, she protested at finding \"a great many Portuguese Jews on board, and other repulsive objects, but we keep clear of them\". Furthermore, she wrote in her diary: \"I do not like the Jewish voice; I do not like the Jewish laugh.\" Her 1938 short story, written during Hitler's rule, \"The Duchess and the Jeweller\" (originally titled \"The Duchess and the Jew\") has been considered antisemitic.\nSome believe that Woolf and her husband Leonard came to despise and fear the 1930s' fascism and antisemitism. Her 1938 book \"Three Guineas\" was an indictment of fascism and what Woolf described as a recurring propensity among patriarchal societies to enforce repressive societal mores by violence. And yet, her 1938 story \"The Duchess and the Jeweller\" was so deeply hateful in its depiction of Jews that \"Harper's Bazaar\" asked her to modify it before publication; she reluctantly complied.\nLegacy.\nVirginia Woolf is known for her contributions to 20th-century literature and her essays, as well as the influence she has had on literary, particularly feminist criticism. A number of authors have stated that their work was influenced by her, including Margaret Atwood, Michael Cunningham, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, and Toni Morrison. Her iconic image is instantly recognisable from the portrait of her aged 20 by George Charles Beresford (at the top of this page) to the Beck and Macgregor portrait in her mother's dress in \"Vogue\" at 44 (see ) or Man Ray's cover of \"Time\" magazine (see ) at 55. More postcards of Woolf are sold by London's National Portrait Gallery than of any other person. Her image is ubiquitous and can be found on products ranging from tea towels to T-shirts.\nVirginia Woolf is studied around the world, with organisations devoted to her, such as the Virginia Woolf Society of Great Britain, and The Virginia Woolf Society of Japan. In addition, trusts\u2014such as the Asham Trust\u2014encouraged writers in her honour.\nIn January 2025 Sophie Oliver, a lecturer of modernism at the University of Liverpool, discovered two previously unknown poems by Woolf, at the Harry Ransom Center, at the University of Texas at Austin. Oliver estimated the date of the poems, which reveal \"a different shade\" to Woolf, as sometime after March 1927.\nMonuments and memorials.\nIn 2013, Woolf was honoured by her alma mater King's College London with the opening of the Virginia Woolf Building on Kingsway, together with an exhibit depicting her accompanied by the quotation \"London itself perpetually attracts, stimulates, gives me a play &amp; a story &amp; a poem\" from her 1926 diary. The University of Kent also named a college after her\u2014Woolf College, which was built in 2008.\nBusts of Virginia Woolf have been erected at her home in Rodmell, Sussex, and at Tavistock Square, London, where she lived between 1924 and 1939. She is also honoured at Tavistock Square by the Woolf &amp; Whistle, a bar that is located near where her house once stood.\nIn 2014, she was one of the inaugural honorees in the Rainbow Honor Walk, a walk of fame in San Francisco's Castro neighbourhood noting LGBTQ people who have \"made significant contributions in their fields\".\nA campaign was launched in 2018 to erect a statue of Woolf in Richmond-upon-Thames, where she lived for 10 years. In November 2022 the statue, created by sculptor Laury Dizengremel, was unveiled. It depicts Woolf on a bench overlooking the River Thames and is the first full-size statue of Woolf.\nSelected works.\nWoolf's most notable works include the following.\nNovels.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEssays and essay collections.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is connected in parallel. It usually has a high resistance so that it takes negligible current from the circuit.\nAnalog voltmeters move a pointer across a scale in proportion to the voltage measured and can be built from a galvanometer and series resistor. Meters using amplifiers can measure tiny voltages of microvolts or less. Digital voltmeters give a numerical display of voltage by use of an analog-to-digital converter.\nVoltmeters are made in a wide range of styles, some separately powered (e.g. by battery), and others powered by the measured voltage source itself. Instruments permanently mounted in a panel are used to monitor generators or other fixed apparatus. Portable instruments, usually equipped to also measure current and resistance in the form of a multimeter are standard test instruments used in electrical and electronics work. Any measurement that can be converted to a voltage can be displayed on a meter that is suitably calibrated; for example, pressure, temperature, flow or level in a chemical process plant.\nGeneral-purpose analog voltmeters may have an accuracy of a few percent of full scale and are used with voltages from a fraction of a volt to several thousand volts. Digital meters can be made with high accuracy, typically better than 1%. Specially calibrated test instruments have higher accuracies, with laboratory instruments capable of measuring to accuracies of a few parts per million. Part of the problem of making an accurate voltmeter is that of calibration to check its accuracy. In laboratories, the Weston cell is used as a standard voltage for precision work. Precision voltage references are available based on electronic circuits.\nSchematic symbol.\nIn circuit diagrams, a voltmeter is represented by the letter \"V\" in a circle, with two emerging lines representing the two points of measurement.\nAnalog voltmeter.\nA moving coil galvanometer can be used as a voltmeter by inserting a resistor in series with the instrument. The galvanometer has a coil of fine wire suspended in a strong magnetic field. When an electric current is applied, the interaction of the magnetic field of the coil and of the stationary magnet creates a torque, tending to make the coil rotate. The torque is proportional to the current through the coil. The coil rotates, compressing a spring that opposes the rotation. The deflection of the coil is thus proportional to the current, which in turn is proportional to the applied voltage, which is indicated by a pointer on a scale. \nOne of the design objectives of the instrument is to disturb the circuit as little as possible and so the instrument should draw a minimum of current to operate. This is achieved by using a sensitive galvanometer in series with a high resistance, and then the entire instrument is connected in parallel with the circuit examined.\nThe sensitivity of such a meter can be expressed as \"ohms per volt\", the number of ohms resistance in the meter circuit divided by the full scale measured value. For example, a meter with a sensitivity of 1000 ohms per volt would draw 1 milliampere at full scale voltage; if the full scale was 200 volts, the resistance at the instrument's terminals would be ohms and at full scale, the meter would draw 1 milliampere from the circuit under test. For multi-range instruments, the input resistance varies as the instrument is switched to different ranges.\nMoving-coil instruments with a permanent-magnet field respond only to direct current. Measurement of AC voltage requires a rectifier in the circuit so that the coil deflects in only one direction. Some moving-coil instruments are also made with the zero position in the middle of the scale instead of at one end; these are useful if the voltage reverses its polarity.\nVoltmeters operating on the electrostatic principle use the mutual repulsion between two charged plates to deflect a pointer attached to a spring. Meters of this type draw negligible current but are sensitive to voltages over about 100 volts and work with either alternating or direct current.\nAmplified voltmeter.\nThe sensitivity and input resistance of a voltmeter can be increased if the current required to deflect the meter pointer is supplied by an amplifier and power supply instead of by the circuit under test. The electronic amplifier between input and meter gives two benefits; a rugged moving coil instrument can be used, since its sensitivity need not be high, and the input resistance can be made high, reducing the current drawn from the circuit under test. Amplified voltmeters often have an input resistance of 1, 10, or 20 megohms which is independent of the range selected. A once-popular form of this instrument used a vacuum tube in the amplifier circuit and so was called the vacuum tube voltmeter (VTVM). These were almost always powered by the local AC line current and so were not particularly portable. Today these circuits use a solid-state amplifier using field-effect transistors, hence FET-VM, and appear in handheld digital multimeters as well as in bench and laboratory instruments. These largely replaced non-amplified multimeters except in the least expensive price ranges.\nMost VTVMs and FET-VMs handle DC voltage, AC voltage, and resistance measurements; modern FET-VMs add current measurements and often other functions as well. A specialized form of the VTVM or FET-VM is the AC voltmeter. These instruments are optimized for measuring AC voltage. They have much wider bandwidth and better sensitivity than a typical multifunction device.\nDigital voltmeter.\nA digital voltmeter (DVM) measures an unknown input voltage by converting the voltage to a digital value and then displays the voltage in numeric form. DVMs are usually designed around a special type of analog-to-digital converter called an integrating converter.\nDVM measurement accuracy is affected by many factors, including temperature, input impedance, and DVM power supply voltage variations. Less expensive DVMs often have input resistance on the order of 10 M\u03a9. Precision DVMs can have input resistances of 1 G\u03a9 or higher for the lower voltage ranges (e.g. less than 20 V). To ensure that a DVM's accuracy is within the manufacturer's specified tolerances, it must be periodically calibrated against a voltage standard such as the Weston cell.\nThe first digital voltmeter was invented and produced by Andrew Kay of Non-Linear Systems (and later founder of Kaypro) in 1954.\nSimple AC voltmeters use a rectifier connected to a DC measurement circuit, which responds to the average value of the waveform. The meter can be calibrated to display the root mean square value of the waveform, assuming a fixed relation between the average value of the rectified waveform and the RMS value. If the waveform departs significantly from the sinewave assumed in the calibration, the meter will be inaccurate, though for simple wave shapes the reading can be corrected by multiplying by a constant factor. Early \"true RMS\" circuits used a thermal converter that responded only to the RMS value of the waveform. Modern instruments calculate the RMS value by electronically calculating the square of the input value, taking the average, and then calculating the square root of the value. This allows accurate RMS measurements for a variety of waveforms.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "32745", "revid": "47285530", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32745", "title": "Venus", "text": "Second planet from the Sun\nVenus is the second planet from the Sun. It is often called Earth's \"twin\" or \"sister\" among the planets of the Solar System for its orbit being the closest to Earth's, both being rocky planets, and having the most similar and nearly equal size, mass, and surface gravity. Venus, though, is significantly different, especially as it has no liquid water, and its atmosphere is far thicker and denser than that of any other rocky body in the Solar System. The atmosphere is composed mostly of carbon dioxide and has a thick cloud layer of sulfuric acid that spans the whole planet. At the mean surface level, the atmosphere reaches a temperature of and a pressure 92 times greater than Earth's at sea level, turning the lowest layer of the atmosphere into a supercritical fluid. From Earth, Venus is visible as a star-like point of light, appearing brighter than any other natural point of light in the sky, and as an inferior planet always relatively close to the Sun, either as the brightest \"morning star\" or \"evening star\".\nThe orbits of Venus and Earth make the two planets approach each other in synodic periods of 1.6 years. In the course of this, Venus comes closer to Earth than any other planet, in contrast to Mercury which stays closer over the course of an orbit to Earth than any other planet, due to its orbit being closer to the Sun. In interplanetary spaceflight from Earth, Venus is frequently used as a waypoint for gravity assists, offering a faster and more economical route. Venus has no moons and a very slow retrograde rotation about its axis, a result of competing forces of solar tidal locking and differential heating of Venus's massive atmosphere. As a result, a Venusian day is 116.75 Earth days long, about half a Venusian solar year, which is 224.7 Earth days long.\nVenus has a weak magnetosphere; lacking an internal dynamo, it is induced by the solar wind interacting with the atmosphere. Internally, Venus has a core, a mantle, and a crust. Internal heat escapes through active volcanism, resulting in resurfacing, instead of plate tectonics. Venus may have had liquid surface water early in its history with a habitable environment, before a runaway greenhouse effect evaporated any water and turned Venus into its present state. There are atmospheric conditions at cloud layer altitudes that are the most similar ones to Earth in the Solar System and have been identified as possibly favourable for life on Venus, with potential biomarkers found in 2020, spurring new research and missions to Venus.\nThroughout history humans across the globe have observed Venus and it has acquired particular importance in many cultures. With telescopes, the phases of Venus became discernible and, by 1613, were presented as decisive evidence disproving the then-dominant geocentric model and supporting the heliocentric model. Venus was visited for the first time in 1961 by Venera 1, which flew past the planet, achieving the first interplanetary spaceflight. The first data from Venus were returned during the second interplanetary mission, Mariner 2, in 1962. In 1967, the first interplanetary impactor, Venera 4, reached Venus, followed by the lander Venera 7 in 1970. As of 2025[ [update]], Solar Orbiter is on its way to fly-by Venus in 2026, and the next mission planned to launch to Venus is the Venus Life Finder, scheduled for 2026 as well.\nPhysical characteristics.\nVenus is one of the four terrestrial planets in the Solar System, meaning that it is a rocky body like Earth. It is similar to Earth in size and mass and is often described as Earth's \"sister\" or \"twin\". Venus is very close to spherical due to its slow rotation. It has a diameter of \u2014only less than Earth's\u2014and its mass is 81.5% of Earth's, making it the third-smallest planet in the Solar System. Conditions on the surface of Venus differ radically from those on Earth because its dense atmosphere is 96.5% carbon dioxide, causing an intense greenhouse effect, with most of the remaining 3.5% being nitrogen. The surface pressure is , and the average surface temperature is , above the critical points of both major constituents and making the surface atmosphere a supercritical fluid of mainly supercritical carbon dioxide and some supercritical nitrogen.\nNatural history.\nFormation.\nThe rocky terrestrial planets including Venus are thought to have formed in 5 stages: dust settling, planetesimal formation, planetary embryos, giant impacts, and finally formation of atmospheres. Limited measurements from Venus have prevented a more detailed analysis of the formation timeline.\nFuture.\nVenus is expected to be destroyed, along with Mercury, and possibly the Earth and the Moon, when the Sun becomes a red giant in approximately seven or eight billion years.\nGeography.\nThe Venusian surface was a subject of speculation until some of its secrets were revealed by probes in the 20th century. \"Venera\" landers in 1975 and 1982 returned images of a surface covered in sediment and relatively angular rocks. The surface was mapped in detail by \"Magellan\" in 1990\u201391. There is evidence of extensive volcanism, and variations in the atmospheric sulphur dioxide may indicate that there are active volcanoes.\nAbout 80% of the Venusian surface is covered by smooth, volcanic plains, consisting of 70% plains with wrinkle ridges and 10% smooth or lobate plains. Two highland \"continents\" make up the rest of its surface area, one lying in the planet's northern hemisphere and the other just south of the equator. The northern continent is called Ishtar Terra after Ishtar, the Babylonian goddess of love, and is about the size of Australia. The Maxwell Montes mountain range lies on Ishtar Terra. Its peak Skadi Mons is the highest point on Venus, above the Venusian average surface elevation. The southern continent is called Aphrodite Terra, after the Greek mythological goddess of love, and is the larger of the two highland regions at roughly the size of South America. A network of fractures and faults covers much of this area.\nThere is recent evidence of lava flow on Venus (2024), such as flows on Sif Mons, a shield volcano, and on Niobe Planitia, a flat plain. There are visible calderas. The planet has few impact craters, demonstrating that the surface is relatively young, at 300\u2013600million years old. Venus has some unique surface features in addition to the impact craters, mountains, and valleys commonly found on rocky planets. Among these are flat-topped volcanic features called \"farra\", which look somewhat like pancakes and range in size from across, and from high; radial, star-like fracture systems called \"novae\"; features with both radial and concentric fractures resembling spider webs, known as \"arachnoids\"; and \"coronae\", circular rings of fractures sometimes surrounded by a depression. These features are volcanic in origin.\nMost Venusian surface features are named after historical and mythological women. Exceptions are Maxwell Montes, named after James Clerk Maxwell, and highland regions Alpha Regio, Beta Regio, and Ovda Regio. The last three features were named before the current system was adopted by the International Astronomical Union, the body which oversees planetary nomenclature.\nThe longitude of physical features on Venus is expressed relative to its prime meridian. The original prime meridian passed through the radar-bright spot at the centre of the oval feature Eve, located south of Alpha Regio. After the Venera missions were completed, the prime meridian was redefined to pass through the central peak in the crater Ariadne on Sedna Planitia.\nThe stratigraphically oldest tessera terrains have consistently lower thermal emissivity than the surrounding basaltic plains measured by \"Venus Express\" and \"Magellan\", indicating a different, possibly a more felsic, mineral assemblage. The mechanism to generate a large amount of felsic crust usually requires the presence of a water ocean and plate tectonics, implying that habitable condition existed on early Venus, with large bodies of water at some point. However, the nature of tessera terrains is far from certain.\nStudies reported in 2023 suggested for the first time that Venus may have had plate tectonics during ancient times and, as a result, may have had a more habitable environment, possibly one capable of sustaining life. Venus has gained interest as a case for research into the development of Earth-like planets and their habitability.\nVolcanism.\nMuch of the Venusian surface appears to have been shaped by volcanic activity. Venus has several times as many volcanoes as Earth, and it has 167 large volcanoes that are over across. The only volcanic complex of this size on Earth is the Big Island of Hawaii. More than 85,000 volcanoes on Venus have been identified and mapped. This is not because Venus is more volcanically active than Earth, but because its crust is older and is not subject to the erosion processes active on Earth. Earth's oceanic crust is continually recycled by subduction at the boundaries of tectonic plates, and has an average age of about 100 million years, whereas the Venusian surface is estimated to be 300\u2013600million years old.\nSeveral lines of evidence point to ongoing volcanic activity on Venus. Sulfur dioxide concentrations in the upper atmosphere dropped by a factor of 10 between 1978 and 1986, jumped in 2006, and again declined 10-fold. This may mean that levels were boosted several times by large volcanic eruptions. It has been suggested that Venusian lightning (discussed below) could originate from volcanic activity (i.e. volcanic lightning). In January 2020, astronomers reported evidence suggesting that Venus is currently volcanically active, specifically the detection of olivine, a volcanic product that would weather quickly on the planet's surface.\nThis massive volcanic activity is fuelled by a hot interior, which models say could be explained by energetic collisions when the planet was young, as well as radioactive decay as in the case of the earth. Impacts would have had significantly higher velocity than on Earth, both because Venus moves faster due to its closer proximity to the Sun and because high-eccentricity objects colliding with the planet would have high speeds.\nIn 2008 and 2009, the first direct evidence for ongoing volcanism was observed by \"Venus Express\", in the form of four transient localized infrared hot spots within the rift zone Ganis Chasma, near the shield volcano Maat Mons. Three of the spots were observed in more than one successive orbit. These spots are thought to represent lava freshly released by volcanic eruptions. The actual temperatures are not known, because the size of the hot spots could not be measured, but are likely to have been in the range, relative to a normal temperature of . In 2023, scientists reexamined topographical images of the Maat Mons region taken by the \"Magellan\" orbiter. Using computer simulations, they determined that the topography had changed during an 8-month interval, and concluded that active volcanism was the cause.\nCraters.\nThere are almost a thousand impact craters on Venus, evenly distributed across its surface. On other cratered bodies, such as Earth and the Moon, craters show a range of states of degradation. On the Moon, degradation is caused by subsequent impacts, whereas on Earth it is caused by wind and rain erosion. On Venus, about 85% of the craters are in pristine condition. The number of craters, together with their well-preserved condition, indicates the planet underwent a global resurfacing event 300\u2013600million years ago, followed by a decay in volcanism. Whereas Earth's crust is in continuous motion, Venus is thought to be unable to sustain such a process. Without plate tectonics to dissipate heat from its mantle, Venus instead undergoes a cyclical process in which mantle temperatures rise until they reach a critical level that weakens the crust. Then, over a period of about 100million years, subduction occurs on an enormous scale, completely recycling the crust.\nVenusian craters range from in diameter. No craters are smaller than 3km, because of the effects of the dense atmosphere on incoming objects. Objects with less than a certain kinetic energy are slowed so much by the atmosphere that they do not create an impact crater. Incoming projectiles less than in diameter will fragment and burn up in the atmosphere before reaching the ground.\nInternal structure.\nWithout data from reflection seismology or knowledge of its moment of inertia, little direct information has been available about the internal structure and geochemistry of Venus. The similarity in size and density between Venus and Earth suggests that they share a similar internal structure: a core, mantle, and crust. Like that of Earth, the Venusian core is most likely at least partially liquid because the two planets have been cooling at about the same rate, although a completely solid core cannot be ruled out. The slightly smaller size of Venus means pressures are 24% lower in its deep interior than Earth's. The predicted values for the moment of inertia based on planetary models suggest a core radius of 2,900\u20133,450\u00a0km. There is now an estimate of 3,500\u00a0km from the moment of inertia based on the rate of axial precession, measured between 2006 and 2020.\nThe crust of Venus is estimated to be 40 kilometers thick on average and at most 65 kilometers thick.\nThe principal difference between the two planets is the lack of evidence for plate tectonics on Venus, possibly because its crust is too strong to subduct without water to make it less viscous. This results in reduced heat loss from the planet, preventing it from cooling and providing a likely explanation for its lack of an internally generated magnetic field. Instead, Venus may lose its internal heat in periodic major resurfacing events.\nMagnetic field and core.\nIn 1967, \"Venera 4\" found Venus's magnetic field to be much weaker than that of Earth. This magnetic field is induced by an interaction between the ionosphere and the solar wind, rather than by an internal dynamo as in the Earth's core. Venus's small induced magnetosphere provides negligible protection to the atmosphere against solar and cosmic radiation.\nThe lack of an intrinsic magnetic field on Venus was surprising, given that it is similar to Earth in size and was expected to contain a dynamo at its core. A dynamo requires three things: a conducting liquid, rotation, and convection. The core is thought to be electrically conductive and, although its rotation is often thought to be too slow, simulations show it is adequate to produce a dynamo. This implies that the dynamo is missing because of a lack of convection in Venus's core. On Earth, convection occurs in the liquid outer layer of the core because the bottom of the liquid layer is much higher in temperature than the top. On Venus, a global resurfacing event may have shut down plate tectonics and led to a reduced heat flux through the crust. This insulating effect would cause the mantle temperature to increase, thereby reducing the heat flux out of the core. As a result, no internal geodynamo is available to drive a magnetic field. Instead, the heat from the core is reheating the crust.\nOne possibility is that Venus has no solid inner core, or that its core is not cooling, so that the entire liquid part of the core is at approximately the same temperature. Another possibility is that its core has already been completely solidified. The state of the core is highly dependent on the concentration of sulphur, which is unknown at present.\nAnother possibility is that the absence of a large impact on Venus (\"contra\" the Earth's \"Moon-forming\" impact) left the core of Venus stratified from the core's incremental formation, and without the forces to initiate/sustain convection, and thus a \"geodynamo\".\nThe weak magnetosphere around Venus means that the solar wind interacts directly with its outer atmosphere. Here, ions of hydrogen and oxygen are being created by the dissociation of water molecules due to ultraviolet radiation. The solar wind then supplies energy that gives some of these ions sufficient speed to escape Venus's gravity field. This erosion process results in a steady loss of low-mass hydrogen, helium, and oxygen ions, whereas higher-mass molecules, such as carbon dioxide, are more likely to be retained. Atmospheric erosion by the solar wind could have led to the loss of most of Venus's water during the first billion years after it formed. However, the planet may have retained a dynamo for its first 2\u20133 billion years, so the water loss may have occurred more recently. The erosion has increased the ratio of higher-mass deuterium to lower-mass hydrogen in the atmosphere 100 times compared to the rest of the solar system.\nAtmosphere and climate.\nVenus has a dense atmosphere composed of 96.5% carbon dioxide, 3.5% nitrogen\u2014both exist as supercritical fluids at the planet's surface with a density 6.5% that of water\u2014and traces of other gases including sulphur dioxide. The mass of its atmosphere is 92 times that of Earth's, whereas the pressure at its surface is about 93 times that at Earth's\u2014a pressure equivalent to that at a depth of nearly under Earth's ocean surfaces. The density at the surface is , 6.5% that of water or 50 times as dense as Earth's atmosphere at at sea level. The -rich atmosphere generates the strongest greenhouse effect in the Solar System, creating surface temperatures of at least . This makes the Venusian surface hotter than Mercury's, even though Venus is nearly twice Mercury's distance from the Sun and thus receives only around a quarter of Mercury's solar irradiance, of 2,600 W/m2 (double that of Earth). Because of its runaway greenhouse effect, Venus has been identified by scientists such as Carl Sagan as a warning and research object linked to climate change on Earth. Therefore Venus has been called a greenhouse planet, a planet under a greenhouse inferno.\nVenus's atmosphere is rich in primordial noble gases compared to that of Earth. This enrichment indicates an early divergence from Earth in evolution. An unusually large comet impact or accretion of a more massive primary atmosphere from the solar nebula have been proposed to explain the enrichment. However, the atmosphere is poor in radiogenic argon-40, a proxy for mantle degassing, suggesting an early shutdown of major magmatism.\nStudies have suggested that billions of years ago, the atmosphere of Venus may have been much more like the one surrounding the early Earth, and there may have been substantial quantities of liquid water on the surface. After a period of 600 million to several billion years, the rising luminosity of the Sun and possibly large volcanic resurfacing caused the evaporation of the original water. A runaway greenhouse effect was created once a critical level of greenhouse gases (including water) was reached in the atmosphere. Although the surface conditions on Venus are no longer hospitable to any terrestrial-like life that might have formed before this event, there is speculation that life may exist in the upper cloud layers of Venus, above the surface, where atmospheric conditions are the most Earth-like in the Solar System, with temperatures ranging between , and the pressure and radiation being about the same as at Earth's surface, but with acidic clouds and the carbon dioxide air. More specifically, between heights of 48 and 59\u00a0km temperature and radiation conditions are suitable for life. At lower elevations water would evaporate and at higher elevation UV radiation would be too strong. The putative detection of an absorption line of phosphine in Venus's atmosphere, with no known pathway for abiotic production, led to speculation in September 2020 that there could be extant life currently present in the atmosphere. Later research attributed the spectroscopic signal that was interpreted as phosphine to sulphur dioxide, or found that in fact there was no absorption line.\nThermal inertia and the transfer of heat by winds in the lower atmosphere mean that the surface temperature does not vary significantly between the hemispheres facing and not facing the Sun, despite Venus's slow rotation. Winds at the surface are slow, moving at a few kilometres per hour, but because of the high density of the atmosphere at the surface, they exert a significant amount of force against obstructions, and transport dust and small stones across the surface. This alone would make it difficult for a human to walk through, even without the heat, pressure, and lack of oxygen.\nAbove the dense layer are thick clouds 45 to 70\u00a0km above the surface, consisting mainly of sulphuric acid, which is formed by a reaction catalyzed by UV radiation from sulphur dioxide molecules and then water, resulting in sulphuric acid hydrate. Additionally, the clouds contain approximately 1% ferric chloride. Other possible constituents of the cloud particles are ferric sulfate, aluminium chloride and phosphoric anhydride. Clouds at different levels have different compositions and particle size distributions. These clouds reflect, like thick cloud cover on Earth, about 70% of the sunlight that falls on them back into space, and since they cover the whole planet they prevent visual observation of the surface. The permanent cloud cover means that although Venus is closer than Earth to the Sun, it receives less sunlight on the ground, with only 10% of the received sunlight reaching the surface, resulting in average daytime levels of illumination at the surface of 14,000 lux, comparable to that on Earth \"in the daytime with overcast clouds\".\nVenus's atmosphere rotates much faster than its solid body, a phenomenon known as atmospheric super-rotation. This results in strong winds at the cloud tops, which complete a full rotation around the planet in about 4 days, corresponding to 60 times the speed of the planet's rotation, whereas Earth's strongest winds reach only 10\u201320% of its rotational speed.\nAlthough Venus looks featureless in visible light, there are bands or streaks in the UV, whose origin has not been pinned down. The absorption of UV may be due to a compound of oxygen and sulfur, OSSO, which has a double bond between the sulfur atoms and exists in \"cis\" and \"trans\" forms, or due to polysulfur compounds from to .\nThe surface of Venus is effectively isothermal; it retains a constant temperature not only between the two hemispheres but between the equator and the poles. Venus's minute axial tilt\u2014less than 3\u00b0, compared to 23\u00b0 on Earth\u2014also minimizes seasonal temperature variation. Altitude is one of the few factors that affect Venusian temperatures. The highest point on Venus, Skadi Mons of the Maxwell Montes range, is therefore the coolest point on Venus, with a temperature of about and an atmospheric pressure of about . In 1995, the \"Magellan\" spacecraft imaged a highly reflective substance at the tops of the highest mountain peaks, a \"Venus snow\" that bore a strong resemblance to terrestrial snow. This substance likely formed by a similar process to snow, albeit at a far higher temperature. Too volatile to condense on the surface, it rose in gaseous form to higher elevations, where it is cooler and could precipitate. The identity of this substance is not known with certainty, but speculation has ranged from elemental tellurium to lead sulfide (galena).\nAlthough Venus has no seasons, in 2019 astronomers identified a cyclical variation in sunlight absorption by the atmosphere, possibly caused by opaque, absorbing particles suspended in the upper clouds. The variation causes observed changes in the speed of Venus's zonal winds and appears to rise and fall in time with the Sun's 11-year sunspot cycle.\nThe existence of lightning in the atmosphere of Venus has been controversial since the first suspected bursts were detected by the Soviet Venera probes. In 2006\u201307, \"Venus Express\" clearly detected whistler mode waves, the signatures of lightning. Their intermittent appearance indicates a pattern associated with weather activity. According to these measurements, the lightning rate is at least half that on Earth, however other instruments have not detected lightning at all. The origin of any lightning remains unclear, but could originate from clouds or Venusian volcanoes.\nIn 2007, \"Venus Express\" discovered that a huge double atmospheric polar vortex exists at the south pole. \"Venus Express\" discovered, in 2011, that an ozone layer exists high in the atmosphere of Venus. In 2013 ESA scientists reported that the ionosphere of Venus streams outwards in a manner similar to \"the ion tail seen streaming from a comet under similar conditions.\"\nIn December 2015, and to a lesser extent in April and May 2016, researchers working on Japan's \"Akatsuki\" mission observed bow-shaped objects in the atmosphere of Venus. This was considered direct evidence of the existence of perhaps the largest stationary gravity waves in the solar system.\nColour and sound of the atmosphere at the surface have been recorded, with the sky having an orange-yellow colour, while at higher altitudes being white.\nOrbit and rotation.\nVenus orbits the Sun at an average distance of about , and completes an orbit every 224.7 days. It completes 13 orbits in 7.998 years, so its position in our sky almost repeats every eight years. Although all planetary orbits are elliptical, Venus's orbit is currently the closest to circular, with an eccentricity of less than 0.01. Simulations of the early solar system orbital dynamics have shown that the eccentricity of the Venus orbit may have been substantially larger in the past, reaching values as high as 0.31 and possibly impacting early climate evolution.\nVenus has retrograde rotation, meaning that unlike most planets including Earth it rotates clockwise around its own axis, opposite to its anticlockwise rotation around the Sun.\nTherefore Venusian sidereal day, 243 Earth days, lasts longer than a Venusian year, 224.7 Earth days.\nIf Venus were tidally locked to the Sun, it would always have the same face pointed to the Sun and its sidereal day would be 224.7 days. However, Venus's atmosphere is massive and it is close to the Sun, so differential heating of the atmosphere gives Venus a small retrograde rotation. The day length also fluctuates by up to 20 minutes for the same reason. Venus's rotation period measured with \"Magellan\" spacecraft data over a 500-day period is smaller than the rotation period measured during the 16-year period between the Magellan spacecraft and \"Venus Express\" visits, with a difference of about 6.5minutes. Because of the retrograde rotation, the length of a solar day on Venus is significantly shorter than the sidereal day, at 116.75 Earth days.\nOne Venusian year is about 1.92Venusian solar days. To an observer on the surface of Venus, the Sun would rise in the west and set in the east, although Venus's opaque clouds prevent observing the Sun from the planet's surface.\nVenus may have formed from the solar nebula with a different rotation period and obliquity, reaching its current state because of chaotic spin changes caused by planetary perturbations and tidal effects on its dense atmosphere, a change that would have occurred over the course of billions of years. The rotation period of Venus may represent an equilibrium state between tidal locking to the Sun's gravitation, which tends to slow rotation, and an atmospheric tide created by solar heating of the thick Venusian atmosphere. The 584-day average interval between successive close approaches to Earth is almost exactly equal to 5Venusian solar days (5.001444 to be precise), but the hypothesis of a spin-orbit resonance with Earth has been discounted.\nVenus has no natural satellites. It has several trojan asteroids: the quasi-satellite 524522 Zoozve and two other temporary trojans, 2001 CK32 and . In the 17th century, Giovanni Cassini reported a moon orbiting Venus, which was named Neith and numerous sightings were reported over the following , but most were determined to be stars in the vicinity. Alex Alemi's and David Stevenson's 2006 study of models of the early Solar System at the California Institute of Technology shows Venus likely had at least one moon created by a huge impact event billions of years ago. About 10millionyears later, according to the study, another impact reversed the planet's spin direction and the resulting tidal deceleration caused the Venusian moon gradually to spiral inward until it collided with Venus. If later impacts created moons, these were removed in the same way. An alternative explanation for the lack of satellites is the effect of strong solar tides, which can destabilize large satellites orbiting the inner terrestrial planets.\nThe orbital space of Venus has a dust ring-cloud, with a suspected origin either from Venus\u2013trailing asteroids, interplanetary dust migrating in waves, or the remains of the Solar System's original circumstellar disc that formed the planetary system.\nOrbit in respect to Earth.\nEarth and Venus have a near orbital resonance of 13:8 (Earth orbits eight times for every 13 orbits of Venus).\nTherefore, they approach each other and reach inferior conjunction in synodic periods of 584 days, on average. The path that Venus makes in relation to Earth viewed geocentrically draws a pentagram over five synodic periods, shifting every period by 144\u00b0. This pentagram of Venus is sometimes referred to as the petals of Venus due to the path's visual similarity to a flower.\nWhen Venus lies between Earth and the Sun in inferior conjunction, it makes the closest approach to Earth of any planet at an average distance of .\nBecause of the decreasing eccentricity of Earth's orbit, the minimum distances will become greater over tens of thousands of years. From the year1 to 5383, there are 526 approaches less than ; then, there are none for about 60,158 years.\nWhile Venus approaches Earth the closest, Mercury is more often the closest to Earth of all planets and to any other planet. Venus has been used as a waypoint for gravity assist manoeuvres, which has been identified as a faster and economic way to travel to Mercury, the Sun, asteroids, Mars, Jupiter and beyond.\nTidally Venus exerts the third strongest tidal force on Earth, after the Moon and the Sun, though significantly less.\nObservability.\nTo the naked eye, Venus appears as a white point of light with a maximum apparent magnitude of \u22124.92 brighter than any other planet or star apart from the Sun, even when faintest during its transit with an apparent magnitude of \u22122.98. The planet's mean apparent magnitude is \u22124.14 with a standard deviation of 0.31. The brightest magnitude occurs during the crescent phase about one month before or after an inferior conjunction. Venus fades to about magnitude \u22123 when it is backlit by the Sun, although the exact value depends on the phase angle. The planet is bright enough to be seen in broad daylight, but is more easily visible when the Sun is low on the horizon or setting. As an inferior planet, it always lies within about 47\u00b0 of the Sun.\nVenus \"overtakes\" Earth every 584 days as it orbits the Sun. As it does so, it changes from the \"Evening Star\", visible after sunset, to the \"Morning Star\", visible before sunrise. Although Mercury, the other inferior planet, reaches a maximum elongation of only 28\u00b0 and is often difficult to discern in twilight, Venus is hard to miss when it is at its brightest. Its greater maximum elongation means it is visible in dark skies long after sunset. As the brightest point-like object in the sky, Venus is a commonly misreported \"unidentified flying object\".\nBecause Venus comes close to the earth at inferior conjunction and has an orbit inclined to the plane of the earth's orbit, it can appear more than 8\u00b0 north or south of the ecliptic, more than any other planet or the moon. Every eight years around March it appears this far north of the ecliptic, in Pisces (such as in mid-March 2025), and every eight years it appears this far south of the ecliptic in August or September in Virgo (as in late August 2023). Venus can thus be north of the sun and appear as a morning star and an evening star on the same day, in the northern hemisphere. The timing of these north or south excursions gets slowly earlier in the year, and over 30 cycles (240 years) the cycle is gradually replaced by another cycle offset by three years, so the situation returns close to the original situation after 243 orbits of Earth, 395 of Venus.\nLunar occultations of Venus, in which the moon blocks the view of Venus for observers in certain parts of the earth, occur on average about twice a year, sometimes several times in a year (though rarely).\nPhases.\nAs it orbits the Sun, Venus displays phases like those of the Moon in a telescopic view. The planet appears as a small and \"full\" disc when it is on the opposite side of the Sun (at superior conjunction). Venus shows a larger disc and \"quarter phase\" at its maximum elongations from the Sun, and appears at its brightest in the night sky. The planet presents a much larger thin \"crescent\" in telescopic views as it passes along the near side between Earth and the Sun. Venus displays its largest size and \"new phase\" when it is between Earth and the Sun (at inferior conjunction). Its atmosphere is visible through telescopes by the halo of sunlight refracted around it. The phases are clearly visible in a 4\" telescope. Although naked eye visibility of Venus's phases is disputed, records exist of observations of its crescent.\nDaylight apparitions.\nWhen Venus is sufficiently bright with enough angular distance from the sun, it is easily observed in a clear daytime sky with the naked eye, though most people do not know to look for it. Astronomer Edmund Halley calculated its maximum naked eye brightness in 1716, when many Londoners were alarmed by its appearance in the daytime. French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte once witnessed a daytime apparition of the planet while at a reception in Luxembourg. Another historical daytime observation of the planet took place during the inauguration of the American president Abraham Lincoln in Washington, D.C., on 4March 1865.\nTransits.\nA transit of Venus is the appearance of Venus in front of the Sun, during inferior conjunction. Since the orbit of Venus is slightly inclined relative to Earth's orbit, most inferior conjunctions with Earth, which occur every synodic period of 1.6 years, do not produce a transit of Venus. Consequently, Venus transits only occur when an inferior conjunction takes place during some days of June or December, when the orbits of Venus and Earth cross a straight line with the Sun. This results in Venus transiting above Earth in a sequence currently of , , and , forming cycles of .\nHistorically, transits of Venus were important, because they allowed astronomers to determine the size of the astronomical unit, and hence the size of the Solar System as shown by Jeremiah Horrocks in 1639 with the first known observation of a Venus transit (after history's first observed planetary transit in 1631, of Mercury).\nOnly seven Venus transits have been observed so far, since their occurrences were calculated in the 1621 by Johannes Kepler. Captain Cook sailed to Tahiti in 1768 to record the third observed transit of Venus, which subsequently resulted in the exploration of the east coast of Australia.\nThe latest pair was 8 June 2004 and 5\u20136 June 2012. The transit could be watched live from many online outlets or observed locally with the right equipment and conditions. The preceding pair of transits occurred in December 1874 and December 1882.\nThe next transit will occur in December 2117 and December 2125.\nAshen light.\nA long-standing mystery of Venus observations is the so-called ashen light\u2014an apparent weak illumination of its dark side, seen when the planet is in the crescent phase. The first claimed observation of ashen light was made in 1643, but the existence of the illumination has never been reliably confirmed. Observers have speculated it may result from electrical activity in the Venusian atmosphere, but it could be illusory, resulting from the physiological effect of observing a bright, crescent-shaped object. The ashen light has often been sighted when Venus is in the evening sky, when the evening terminator of the planet is towards Earth.\nObservation and exploration history.\nEarly observation.\nVenus is in Earth's sky bright enough to be visible without aid, making it one of the classical planets that human cultures have known and identified throughout history, particularly for being the third brightest object in Earth's sky after the Sun and the Moon. Because the movements of Venus appear to be discontinuous (it disappears due to its proximity to the sun, for many days at a time, and then reappears on the other horizon), some cultures did not recognize Venus as a single entity; instead, they assumed it to be two separate stars on each horizon: the morning and evening star. Nonetheless, a cylinder seal from the Jemdet Nasr period and the Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa from the First Babylonian dynasty indicate that the ancient Sumerians already knew that the morning and evening stars were the same celestial object.\nIn the Old Babylonian period, the planet Venus was known as Ninsi'anna, and later as Dilbat. The name \"Ninsi'anna\" translates to \"divine lady, illumination of heaven\", which refers to Venus as the brightest visible \"star\". Earlier spellings of the name were written with the cuneiform sign si4 (= SU, meaning \"to be red\"), and the original meaning may have been \"divine lady of the redness of heaven\", in reference to the colour of the morning and evening sky.\nThe Chinese historically referred to the morning Venus as \"the Great White\" ( ) or \"the Opener (Starter) of Brightness\" ( ), and the evening Venus as \"the Excellent West One\" ( ).\nThe ancient Greeks initially believed Venus to be two separate stars: Phosphorus, the morning star, and Hesperus, the evening star. Pliny the Elder credited the realization that they were a single object to Pythagoras in the sixth century BC, while Diogenes La\u00ebrtius argued that Parmenides (early fifth century) was probably responsible for this discovery. Though they recognized Venus as a single object, the ancient Romans continued to designate the morning aspect of Venus as Lucifer, literally \"Light-Bringer\", and the evening aspect as Vesper, both of which are literal translations of their traditional Greek names.\nIn the second century, in his astronomical treatise \"Almagest\", Ptolemy theorized that both Mercury and Venus were located between the Sun and the Earth. The 11th-century Persian astronomer Avicenna claimed to have observed a transit of Venus (although there is some doubt about it), which later astronomers took as confirmation of Ptolemy's theory. In the 12th century, the Andalusian astronomer Ibn Bajjah observed \"two planets as black spots on the face of the Sun\"; these were thought to be the transits of Venus and Mercury by 13th-century Maragha astronomer Qotb al-Din Shirazi, though this cannot be true as there were no Venus transits in Ibn Bajjah's lifetime.\nVenus and early modern astronomy.\nWhen the planet was first observed with a telescope in December 1610, by the Italian physicist Galileo Galilei, he found it showed phases like the Moon, varying from crescent to gibbous to full and vice versa. When Venus is furthest from the Sun in the sky, it shows a half-lit phase, and when it is closest to the Sun in the sky, it shows as a crescent or full phase. This could be possible only if Venus orbited the Sun, reported by Galileo in his 1613 Letters on Sunspots, becoming one of the first observations to clearly contradict the Ptolemaic geocentric model that the Solar System was concentric and centred on Earth.\nThe 1631 transit of Venus, while not recorded, was the first one successfully predicted, by Johannes Kepler and his calculations, which he published in 1629. The following 1639 transit of Venus was accurately predicted by Jeremiah Horrocks and observed by him and his friend, William Crabtree, at each of their respective homes, on 4December 1639 (24 November under the Julian calendar in use at that time).\nThe atmosphere of Venus was discovered in 1761 by Russian polymath Mikhail Lomonosov. Venus's atmosphere was observed in 1790 by German astronomer Johann Schr\u00f6ter. Schr\u00f6ter found when the planet was a thin crescent, the cusps extended through more than 180\u00b0. He correctly surmised this was due to scattering of sunlight in a dense atmosphere. Later, American astronomer Chester Smith Lyman observed a complete ring around the dark side of the planet when it was at inferior conjunction, providing further evidence for an atmosphere. The atmosphere complicated efforts to determine a rotation period for the planet, and observers such as Italian-born astronomer Giovanni Cassini and Schr\u00f6ter incorrectly estimated periods of about from the motions of markings on the planet's apparent surface.\nEarly 20th century advances.\nLittle more was discovered about Venus until the 20th century. Its almost featureless disc gave no hint what its surface might be like, and it was only with the development of spectroscopic and ultraviolet observations that more of its secrets were revealed.\nThe first ultraviolet observations were carried out in the 1920s, when Frank E. Ross found that ultraviolet photographs revealed considerable detail that was absent in visible and infrared radiation. He suggested this was due to a dense, yellow lower atmosphere with high cirrus clouds above it.\nIt had been noted that Venus had no discernible oblateness in its disk, suggesting a slow rotation, and some astronomers concluded based on this that it was tidally locked like Mercury was believed to be at the time; but other researchers had detected a significant quantity of heat coming from the planet's nightside, suggesting a quick rotation (a high surface temperature was not suspected at the time), confusing the issue. Later work in the 1950s showed the rotation was retrograde.\nFirst missions to Venus.\nThe first interplanetary spaceflight attempt was in 1961 when the robotic space probe \"Venera 1\" of the Soviet Venera programme flew to Venus. It lost contact en route.\nThe first successful interplanetary mission, also to Venus, was \"Mariner 2\" of the United States' Mariner programme, passing on 14 December 1962 at above the surface of Venus and gathering data on the planet's atmosphere.\nAdditionally radar observations of Venus were first carried out in the 1960s, and provided the first measurements of the rotation period, which were close to the actual value.\n\"Venera 3\", launched in 1966, became humanity's first probe and lander to reach and impact another celestial body other than the Moon, but could not return data as it crashed into the surface of Venus. In 1967, \"Venera 4\" was launched and successfully deployed science experiments in the Venusian atmosphere before impacting. \"Venera 4\" showed the surface temperature was hotter than \"Mariner 2\" had calculated, at almost , determined that the atmosphere was 95% carbon dioxide (CO2), and discovered that Venus's atmosphere was considerably denser than \"Venera 4\"'s designers had anticipated.\nIn an early example of space cooperation the data of \"Venera 4\" was joined with the 1967 \"Mariner 5\" data, analysed by a combined Soviet\u2013American science team in a series of colloquia over the following year.\nOn 15 December 1970, \"Venera 7\" became the first spacecraft to soft land on another planet and the first to transmit data from there back to Earth.\nIn 1974, \"Mariner 10\" swung by Venus to bend its path towards Mercury and took ultraviolet photographs of the clouds, revealing the extraordinarily high wind speeds in the Venusian atmosphere. This was the first interplanetary gravity assist ever used, a technique which would be used by later probes.\nRadar observations in the 1970s revealed details of the Venusian surface for the first time. Pulses of radio waves were beamed at the planet using the radio telescope at Arecibo Observatory, and the echoes revealed two highly reflective regions, designated the Alpha and Beta regions. The observations revealed a bright region attributed to mountains, which was called Maxwell Montes. These three features are now the only ones on Venus that do not have female names.\nIn 1975, the Soviet \"Venera 9\" and \"10\" landers transmitted the first images from the surface of Venus, which were in black and white. NASA obtained additional data with the Pioneer Venus project, consisting of two separate missions: the Pioneer Venus Multiprobe and Pioneer Venus Orbiter, orbiting Venus between 1978 and 1992. In 1982 the first monochrome colour filters images of the surface were obtained with the Soviet \"Venera\u00a013\" and \"14\" landers. After \"Venera 15\" and \"16\" operated between 1983 and 1984 in orbit, conducting detailed mapping of 25% of Venus's terrain (from the north pole to 30\u00b0N latitude), the Soviet Venera programme came to a close.\nIn 1985 the Soviet Vega programme with its \"Vega 1\" and \"Vega 2\" missions carried the last entry probes and carried the first ever extraterrestrial aerobots for the first time achieving atmospheric flight outside Earth by employing inflatable balloons.\nBetween 1990 and 1994, \"Magellan\" operated in orbit until deorbiting, mapping the surface of Venus. Furthermore, probes like \"Galileo\" (1990), and \"Cassini\u2013Huygens\" (1998/1999) visited Venus with flybys en route to other destinations.\nRenewed exploration.\nIn April 2006, \"Venus Express\", the first dedicated Venus mission by the European Space Agency (ESA), entered orbit around Venus. \"Venus Express\" provided unprecedented observation of Venus's atmosphere. ESA concluded the \"Venus Express\" mission in December 2014 deorbiting it in January 2015. The same and following year \"MESSENGER\" visited Venus with flybys en route to other destinations.\nIn 2010, the first successful interplanetary solar sail spacecraft IKAROS travelled to Venus for a flyby.\nBetween 2015 and 2024 Japan's \"Akatsuki\" probe was active in orbit around Venus and BepiColombo performed flybys in 2020/2021.\nActive and planned missions.\nAs of 2025[ [update]] there are no active probes at Venus, with Parker Solar Probe scheduled to return repeatedly to Venus until 2030.\nSeveral probes are under development as well as multiple proposed missions still in their early conceptual stages. The next Venus mission scheduled is the Venus Life Finder, expected to launch not earlier than summer 2026.\nIndian ISRO is working on Venus Orbiter Mission, aiming to launch it in 2028. UAE mission to asteroids, MBR Explorer, will perform a flyby of the planet. NASA approved two missions to the planet, VERITAS and DAVINCI, planned to be launched not earlier then 2031. ESA plans to launch EnVision also in 2031.\nObjectives.\nVenus has been identified for future research as an important case for understanding:\nCrewed mission concepts.\nVenus has been considered since the 1960s as a waypoint for crewed missions to Mars through opposition missions instead of direct conjunction missions with Venus gravity assist flybys, demonstrating that they should be quicker and safer missions to Mars, with better return or abort flight windows, and less or the same amount of radiation exposure from the flight as direct Mars flights.\nPossible atmospheric habitation.\nWhile the surface conditions of Venus are extremely hostile, the atmospheric pressure, temperature, and solar and cosmic radiation 50\u00a0km above the surface are similar to those at Earth's surface (\"clement conditions\"). Among the many engineering challenges for any human presence in the atmosphere of Venus are the corrosive amounts of sulfuric acid in the atmosphere. Aerostats for crewed exploration and possibly for permanent \"floating cities\" in the Venusian atmosphere have been proposed as an alternative to the popular idea of living on planetary surfaces such as Mars. NASA's High Altitude Venus Operational Concept was a training concept to study a crewed aerostat design.\nPossibility of life.\nSpeculation on the possibility of life on Venus's surface decreased significantly after the early 1960s when it became clear that conditions were extreme compared to those on Earth. Venus's extreme temperatures and atmospheric pressure make water-based life, as currently known, unlikely.\nSome scientists have speculated that thermoacidophilic extremophile microorganisms might exist in the cooler, acidic upper layers of the Venusian atmosphere. Such speculations go back to 1967, when Carl Sagan and Harold J. Morowitz suggested in a \"Nature\" article that tiny objects detected in Venus's clouds might be organisms similar to Earth's bacteria (which are of approximately the same size):\nWhile the surface conditions of Venus make the hypothesis of life there implausible, the clouds of Venus are a different story altogether. As was pointed out some years ago, water, carbon dioxide and sunlight\u2014the prerequisites for photosynthesis\u2014are plentiful in the vicinity of the clouds.\nIn August 2019, astronomers led by Yeon Joo Lee reported that long-term pattern of absorbance and albedo changes in the atmosphere of the planet Venus caused by \"unknown absorbers\", which may be chemicals or even large colonies of microorganisms high up in the atmosphere of the planet, affect the climate. Their light absorbance is almost identical to that of micro-organisms in Earth's clouds. Similar conclusions have been reached by other studies.\nIn September 2020, a team of astronomers led by Jane Greaves from Cardiff University announced the likely detection of phosphine, a gas not known to be produced by any known chemical processes on the Venusian surface or atmosphere, in the upper levels of the planet's clouds. One proposed source for this phosphine is living organisms. The phosphine was detected at heights of at least above the surface, and primarily at mid-latitudes with none detected at the poles. The discovery prompted NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine to publicly call for a new focus on the study of Venus, describing the phosphine find as \"the most significant development yet in building the case for life off Earth\".\nSubsequent analysis of the data-processing used to identify phosphine in the atmosphere of Venus has raised concerns that the detection-line may be an artefact. The use of a 12th-order polynomial fit may have amplified noise and generated a false reading (see Runge's phenomenon). Observations of the atmosphere of Venus at other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum in which a phosphine absorption line would be expected did not detect phosphine. By late October 2020, re-analysis of data with a proper subtraction of background did not show a statistically significant detection of phosphine.\nMembers of the team around Greaves, are working as part of a project by the MIT to send with the rocket company Rocket Lab the first private interplanetary space craft, to look for organics by entering the atmosphere of Venus with a probe named Venus Life Finder.\nPlanetary protection.\nDue to the harsh surface environment of Venus, Venus has been under the planetary protection category two, the second lowest. This gives it only a remote chance that spacecraft-borne interplanetary contamination could compromise investigations.\nHowever with findings of potential biosignatures this categorization for at least some atmospheric layers has been called into question, but since these layers have not been identified as sufficiently conductive to live, adjusting the categorization has not been recommended.\nHabitability for humans.\nWhile the surface of Venus is very inhospitable to humans, conditions at altitudes of 50 km above the surface have been identified to be not only hospitable for indigenous but also for human life, more so than anywhere else in the Solar System other than Earth. Conditions, from atmospheric pressure, gravity, and temperature to radiation, but except chemical, are all very much like conditions on Earth at surface level. Because of this prospect, floating habitats for humans at such altitudes have been suggested for humans going to Venus.\nIn culture.\nVenus is among the most prominent features in the night sky, and has been treated as particularly important in mythology, astrology and fiction across many different cultures.\nSeveral hymns praise Inanna in her role as the goddess of the planet Venus. Theology professor Jeffrey Cooley has argued that, in many myths, Inanna's movements may correspond with the movements of the planet Venus in the sky. The discontinuous movements of Venus relate to both mythology as well as Inanna's dual nature. In \"Inanna's Descent to the Underworld\", unlike any other deity, Inanna is able to descend into the netherworld and return to the heavens. The planet Venus appears to make a similar descent, setting in the West and then rising again in the East. An introductory hymn describes Inanna leaving the heavens and heading for \"Kur\", what could be presumed to be, the mountains, replicating the rising and setting of Inanna to the West. In \"Inanna and Shukaletuda\" and \"Inanna's Descent into the Underworld\" appear to parallel the motion of the planet Venus. In \"Inanna and Shukaletuda\", Shukaletuda is described as scanning the heavens in search of Inanna, possibly searching the eastern and western horizons. In the same myth, while searching for her attacker, Inanna herself makes several movements that correspond with the movements of Venus in the sky.\nVia Mesopotamian influence, it is possible that the Ancient Egyptians and Greeks knew that the morning star and the evening star were one and the same as early as the second millennium\u00a0BC\u2014or the Late Period at the latest. The Egyptians knew the morning star as and the evening star as . They depicted Venus at first as a phoenix or heron (see Bennu), calling it 'the crosser' or 'star with crosses', associating it with Osiris, and later depicting it as two-headed (with human or falcon heads), and associated it with Horus, son of Isis (which during the even later Hellenistic period was together with Hathor identified with Aphrodite). The Greeks used the names , meaning 'light-bringer' (whence the element phosphorus; alternately , meaning 'dawn-bringer'), for the morning star, and , meaning 'Western one', for the evening star, both children of dawn Eos and therefore grandchildren of Aphrodite. Though by the Roman era they were recognized as one celestial object, known as \"the star of Venus\", the traditional two Greek names continued to be used, though usually translated to Latin as and .\nClassical poets such as Homer, Sappho, Ovid and Virgil spoke of the star and its light. Poets such as William Blake, Robert Frost, Letitia Elizabeth Landon, Alfred Lord Tennyson and William Wordsworth wrote odes to it. The composer Holst included it as the second movement of his \"The Planets\" suite.\nIn India, the name for Venus in Sanskrit was , meaning 'the planet Shukra'\u2014in reference to Shukra, a powerful saint. As appears in Vedic astrology, the Sanskrit name \"Shukra\" means 'clear, pure' or 'brightness, clearness'. One of the nine Navagraha, it is held to affect wealth, pleasure and reproduction; it was the son of Bhrgu, preceptor of the Daityas, and guru of the Asuras.\nThe English name \"Venus\" stems originally from the ancient Romans. Romans named Venus after their goddess of love, who in turn was based on the ancient Greek love goddess Aphrodite, who was herself based on the similar Sumerian religion goddess Inanna (which is Ishtar in Akkadian religion), all of whom were associated with the planet. The weekday of the planet and these goddesses is Friday, named after the Germanic goddess Frigg, who has been associated with the Roman goddess Venus.\nIn Chinese, the planet is called \"metal star\" or \"gold star\" (); of the five elements of traditional Chinese philosophy, Venus was historically associated with metal. These traditions are shared among modern Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese cultures, including a name for the planet literally meaning 'metal star' () in each language.\nThe Maya considered Venus to be the most important celestial body after the Sun and Moon. They called it , or , 'the Great Star'. The cycles of Venus were important to their calendar and were described in some of their books, such as the \"Maya Codex of Mexico\" and \"Dresden Codex\". The flag of Chile (, 'Lone Star') depicts Venus.\nModern culture.\nThe impenetrable Venusian cloud cover gave science fiction writers free rein to speculate on conditions at its surface; all the more so when early observations showed that not only was it similar in size to Earth, it possessed a substantial atmosphere. Closer to the Sun than Earth, the planet was often depicted as warmer, but still habitable by humans. The genre reached its peak between the 1930s and 1950s, at a time when science had revealed some aspects of Venus, but not yet the harsh reality of its surface conditions. Findings from the first missions to Venus showed reality to be quite different and brought this particular genre to an end. As scientific knowledge of Venus advanced, science fiction authors tried to keep pace, particularly by conjecturing human attempts to terraform Venus.\nSymbols.\nThe symbol of a circle with a small cross beneath is the so-called Venus symbol, gaining its name for being used as the astronomical symbol for Venus. The symbol is of ancient Greek origin, and represents more generally femininity, adopted by biology as gender symbol for female, like the Mars symbol for male and sometimes the Mercury symbol for hermaphrodite. This gendered association of Venus and Mars has been used to pair them heteronormatively, describing women and men stereotypically as being so different that they can be understood as coming from different planets, an understanding popularized in 1992 by the book titled \"Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus\".\nThe Venus symbol was also used in Western alchemy representing the element copper (like the symbol of Mercury is also the symbol of the element mercury), and since polished copper has been used for mirrors from antiquity the symbol for Venus has sometimes been called Venus mirror, representing the mirror of the goddess, although this origin has been discredited as an unlikely origin.\nBesides the Venus symbol, many other symbols have been associated with Venus, other common ones are the crescent or particularly the star, as with the Star of Ishtar.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The was one of the service branches of the National People's Army and primarily performed a coastal defence role along the GDR's Baltic Sea coastline and territorial waters.\nDisbanded one day before the official reunification of Germany, the \"Volksmarine\" served as the naval arm of the East German state for 34 years. Rostock, former home port and headquarters of the \"Volksmarine\", houses Navy Command for the post-reunification \"Deutsche Marine\".\nHistory.\nSoon after the end of World War II and the beginning of the Cold War, the Soviet Union initiated the rearming of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), which had been founded in October 1949 as a satellite state from the Soviet Zone of Occupation. Beginning in 1950, Soviet Navy officers helped to establish the \"Hauptverwaltung Seepolizei\" (Main Administration Sea Police), which was renamed \"Volkspolizei\u2013See (VP\u2013See)\" (People's Police \u2013 Sea) on 1 July 1952. At the same time parts of the erstwhile maritime police were reorganized into the new \"Grenzpolizei\u2013See\" (Border Police \u2013\u2013 Sea), to guard the sea frontiers, and incorporated into the \"Deutsche Grenzpolizei\" (German Border Police) that had been set up in 1946. By 1952 the \"VP\u2013See\" is estimated to have numbered some 8,000 personnel.\nOn 1 March 1956, the GDR formally created its armed forces, the National People's Army (\"Nationale Volksarmee\", NVA), and the \"VP\u2013See\" became the \"Verwaltung Seestreitkr\u00e4fte der NVA\" (Maritime Forces Administration of the NVA) with about 10,000 men. In November 1960, these maritime forces of the National People's Army were officially designated (People's Navy). Over the next years the navy gradually received a number of new ships, mostly built in the GDR. Only the coastal protection ships and some of the fast torpedo boats were provided by the Soviet Union, as were all helicopters, and some auxiliary craft were purchased from Poland.\nFollowing the erection of the Berlin Wall on 13 August 1961, the \"Grenzbrigade K\u00fcste der Grenzpolizei (\"GBK\")\" (Coastal Border Brigade of the Border Police) was incorporated into the . With the reorganization of 1965 all attack forces, i.e., the fast torpedo boats, were combined into a single flotilla (the 6th Flotilla) and stationed on the Bug peninsula of the island of R\u00fcgen. In the 1970s, the had grown to about 18,000 men. In the 1980s some of the ships were replaced and the acquired Soviet-built fighter-bombers.\nAlthough trained and oriented for a confrontation with NATO, the \"Volksmarine\" dealt with a sharp upswing in tensions with the Polish People's Republic, officially an ally, in the mid-to-late 1980s. From 1985 to 1989, the was involved in approximately 180 reported incidents due to a maritime border dispute with Poland in the Bay of Pomerania; in subsequent negotiations about two thirds of the disputed maritime area were allocated to the GDR.\nReunification &amp; disbandment.\nThe was dissolved, like all other branches of the former National People's Army, on 2 October 1990 \u2013 the day before the official reunification of Germany. Some of its staff was absorbed into the \"Bundesmarine\" (which was henceforth called the \"Deutsche Marine\"), some by the German Border Police. Most of the ships and other equipment were scrapped or sold; about one third of the ships went to the Indonesian Navy. Few if any former vessels remain in service with the modern-day German Navy. The last commander of the , \"Vizeadmiral\" Hendrik Born, wrote a multi-paragraph commentary for Dieter Flohr and Peter Seemann's 2009 book, \"Die Volksmarine\", a comprehensive and picture-oriented history of the .\nSurviving vessels.\nOne former \"Volksmarine\" ship, the \"Tarantul\"-class corvette \"Hans Beimler\" (575), formerly in commission from 1986 to 1990, survives at Peenemunde as a museum ship.\nOperative tasks.\nThe was first and foremost a coastal defence force, but offensive action and amphibious assaults against NATO were also included in its training and plans. It was operationally incorporated into the \"United Baltic Sea Fleets\" of the Warsaw Pact states, intended to serve alongside them in the event of war. Its designated area of operations was the Baltic Sea and the entrances to the Baltic Sea. If open warfare had erupted between the Warsaw Pact and NATO, the primary mission of the was to keep the sea lanes open for Soviet reinforcements and to participate in offensive actions against the coasts of hostile nations in the Baltic Sea. For these purposes, it was equipped with light forces such as anti-submarine ships, fast torpedo boats, minesweepers as well as landing craft. Routine duty was heavily focused on extensive reconnaissance activities, carried out mainly by the minesweepers and specialized electronic surveillance boats.\nThe 6th Border Brigade (Coast) had a special responsibility for the prevention of \"Republikflucht\" (people leaving the GDR without official permission). With effect from 1 November 1961, it was subordinated to the . It had a substantial number of small patrol boats and surveillance posts along the coast.\nChief of the People's Navy.\nKnown as \"Chef der Volksmarine\" (Chief of the People's Navy), a total of 6 men led the East German naval service from 1956 to 1990.\nOrganization.\nThe was headed by the \"Kommando der Volksmarine\" (People's Navy HQ Command) in Rostock-Gehlsdorf. It was structured as follows (in 1985):\nShore-based forces consisted of:\nEquipment.\nSurface fleet.\nThe surface fleet was built around its core missions: coastal defense, anti-submarine warfare, and supporting the Soviet Navy in conducting amphibious assaults if called upon. \"Volksmarine\" vessels accordingly were generally focused on speed and mobility, and unlike their \"Bundesmarine\" counterparts in West Germany (which maintained submarines in its fleet from 1960 onward), the \"Volksmarine\" never commissioned any submarines.\nGiven East Germany's close military, economic and political ties with the Soviet Union, many \"Volksmarine\" vessels originated there, but some, like the \"Libelle\"-class torpedo boats and \"Kondor\"-class minesweepers, were entirely East German designs.\nThroughout its 34 years, the \"Volksmarine\" surface fleet consisted of:\nNaval aviation.\nEast German naval aviation capabilities were modest, with all fixed-wing and rotary assets based ashore.\nMusic.\nThe People's Navy's band played a number of specially-composed musical pieces:\nThe musical pieces written for the fell out of use after the reunification of Germany, and are not used by the modern German Navy.\n\"Volksmarine\" admirals.\nThere were 37 admirals in the history of the \"Volksmarine\" and its predecessor organizations.

Its aim is to facilitate \"the development of friendly relations\" among governments through a uniform set of practices and principles; most notably, it codifies the longstanding custom of diplomatic immunity, in which diplomatic missions are granted privileges that enable diplomats to perform their functions without fear of coercion or harassment by the host country. The Vienna Convention is a cornerstone of modern international relations and international law and is almost universally ratified and observed; it is considered one of the most successful legal instruments drafted under the United Nations.\nHistory.\nThroughout the history of sovereign states, diplomats have enjoyed a special status. The principle of diplomatic immunity dates back to ancient times, when Greek and Roman governments granted special status to envoys. This basic concept has endured and continued to evolve over the centuries, remaining an important element of foreign relations up to the present day. Their function to negotiate agreements between states demands certain special privileges. An envoy from another nation is traditionally treated as a guest, their communications with their home nation treated as confidential, and their freedom from coercion and subjugation by the host nation treated as essential.\nThe first attempt to codify diplomatic immunity into diplomatic law occurred with the Congress of Vienna in 1815. This was followed much later by the Convention regarding Diplomatic Officers (Havana, 1928).\nThe present treaty on the treatment of diplomats was the outcome of a draft by the International Law Commission. The treaty was adopted on 18 April 1961, by the United Nations Conference on Diplomatic Intercourse and Immunities held in Vienna, Austria, and first implemented on 24 April 1964. The same Conference also adopted the Optional Protocol concerning Acquisition of Nationality, the Optional Protocol concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes, the Final Act and four resolutions annexed to that Act. One notable aspect which arose from the 1961 treaty was the establishment of the Holy See's diplomatic immunity status with other nations.\nTwo years later, the United Nations adopted a closely related treaty, the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.\nSummary of provisions.\nThe Vienna Convention is an extensive document, containing 53 articles. The following is a basic overview of its key provisions.\nOptional protocols.\nThe same year the treaty was adopted, two protocols were added as amendments; countries may ratify the main treaty without necessarily ratifying these optional agreements.\nStates parties to the convention.\nAs of \u00a02021[ [update]], there are 193 state parties to the Vienna Convention, including all UN member states\u2014with the exceptions of Palau and South Sudan\u2014and the UN observer states of the Holy See and State of Palestine. The Republic of China signed and ratified the convention on 18 April 1961 and 19 December 1969, respectively, prior to the UN granting China's seat to the People's Republic of China. There are no states that have signed the treaty but not ratified it.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "32754", "revid": "16710", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32754", "title": "Valve", "text": "Flow control device\nA valve is a device or natural object that regulates, directs or controls the flow of a fluid (gases, liquids, fluidized solids, or slurries) by opening, closing, or partially obstructing various passageways. Valves are technically fittings, but are usually discussed as a separate category. In an open valve, fluid flows in a direction from higher pressure to lower pressure. The word is derived from the Latin \"valva\", the moving part of a door, in turn from \"volvere\", to turn, roll.\nThe simplest, and very ancient, valve is simply a freely hinged flap which swings down to obstruct fluid (gas or liquid) flow in one direction, but is pushed up by the flow itself when the flow is moving in the opposite direction. This is called a check valve, as it prevents or \"checks\" the flow in one direction. Modern control valves may regulate pressure or flow downstream and operate on sophisticated automation systems.\nValves have many uses, including controlling water for irrigation, industrial uses for controlling processes, residential uses such as on/off and pressure control to dish and clothes washers and taps in the home. Valves are also used in the military and transport sectors. In HVAC ductwork and other near-atmospheric air flows, valves are instead called dampers. In compressed air systems, however, valves are used with the most common type being ball valves.\nApplications.\nValves are found in virtually every industrial process, including water and sewage processing, mining, power generation, processing of oil, gas and petroleum, food manufacturing, chemical and plastic manufacturing and many other fields.\nPeople in developed nations use valves in their daily lives, including plumbing valves, such as taps for tap water, gas control valves on cookers, small valves fitted to washing machines and dishwashers, safety devices fitted to hot water systems, and poppet valves in car engines.\nIn nature, there are valves, for example one-way valves in veins controlling the blood circulation, and heart valves controlling the flow of blood in the chambers of the heart and maintaining the correct pumping action.\nValves may be operated manually, either by a handle or grip, lever, pedal or wheel. Valves may also be automatic, driven by changes in pressure, temperature, or flow. These changes may act upon a diaphragm or a piston which in turn activates the valve, examples of this type of valve found commonly are safety valves fitted to hot water systems or boilers.\nMore complex control systems using valves requiring automatic control based on an external input (i.e., regulating flow through a pipe to a changing set point) require an actuator. An actuator will stroke the valve depending on its input and set-up, allowing the valve to be positioned accurately, and allowing control over a variety of requirements.\nVariation.\nValves vary widely in form and application. Sizes typically range from 0.1\u00a0mm to 60\u00a0cm. Specialized purpose valves can have a diameter exceeding 5 meters.\nValve costs range from simple inexpensive disposable valves to specialized valves which cost thousands of dollars (US) per inch of the diameter of the valve.\nDisposable valves may be found in common household items including mini-pump dispensers and aerosol cans.\nA common use of the term \"valve\" refers to the poppet valves found in the vast majority of modern internal combustion engines such as those in most fossil fuel powered vehicles which are used to control the intake of the fuel-air mixture and allow exhaust gas venting.\nTypes.\nValves are quite diverse and may be classified into a number of basic types. Valves may also be classified by how they are actuated:\nComponents.\nThe main parts of the most usual type of valve are the body and the bonnet. These two parts form the casing that holds the fluid going through the valve.\nBody.\nThe valve's body is the outer casing of most or all of the valve that contains the internal parts or \"trim\". The bonnet is the part of the encasing through which the stem (see below) passes and that forms a guide and seal for the stem. The bonnet typically screws into or is bolted to the valve body.\nValve bodies are usually metallic or plastic. Brass, bronze, gunmetal, cast iron, steel, alloy steels and stainless steels are very common. Seawater applications, like desalination plants, often use duplex valves, as well as super duplex valves, due to their corrosion resistant properties, particularly against warm seawater. Alloy 20 valves are typically used in sulphuric acid plants, whilst monel valves are used in hydrofluoric acid (HF Acid) plants. Hastelloy valves are often used in high temperature applications, such as nuclear plants, whilst inconel valves are often used in hydrogen applications. Plastic bodies are used for relatively low pressures and temperatures. PVC, PP, PVDF and glass-reinforced nylon are common plastics used for valve bodies.\nBonnet.\nA bonnet acts as a cover on the valve body. It is commonly semi-permanently screwed into the valve body or bolted onto it. During manufacture of the valve, the internal parts are put into the body and then the bonnet is attached to hold everything together inside. To access internal parts of a valve, a user would take off the bonnet, usually for maintenance. Many valves do not have bonnets; for example, plug valves usually do not have bonnets. Many ball valves do not have bonnets since the valve body is put together in a different style, such as being screwed together at the middle of the valve body.\nPorts.\nPorts are passages that allow fluid to pass through the valve. Ports are obstructed by the valve member or disc to control flow. Valves most commonly have 2 ports, but may have as many as 20. The valve is almost always connected at its ports to pipes or other components. Connection methods include threadings, compression fittings, glue, cement, flanges, or welding.\nHandle or actuator.\nA handle is used to manually control a valve from outside the valve body. Automatically controlled valves often do not have handles, but some may have a handle (or something similar) anyway to manually override automatic control, such as a stop-check valve. An actuator is a mechanism or device to automatically or remotely control a valve from outside the body. Some valves have neither handle nor actuator because they automatically control themselves from inside; for example, check valves and relief valves may have neither.\nDisc.\nA disc, also known as a valve member, is a movable obstruction inside the stationary body that adjustably restricts flow through the valve. Although traditionally disc-shaped, discs come in various shapes. Depending on the type of valve, a disc can move linearly inside a valve, or rotate on the stem (as in a butterfly valve), or rotate on a hinge or trunnion (as in a check valve). A ball is a round valve member with one or more paths between ports passing through it. By rotating the ball, flow can be directed between different ports. Ball valves use spherical rotors with a cylindrical hole drilled as a fluid passage. Plug valves use cylindrical or conically tapered rotors called plugs. Other round shapes for rotors are possible as well in rotor valves, as long as the rotor can be turned inside the valve body. However, not all round or spherical discs are rotors; for example, a ball check valve uses the ball to block reverse flow, but is not a rotor because operating the valve does not involve rotation of the ball.\nSeat.\nThe \"seat\" is the interior surface of the body which contacts the disc to form a leak-tight seal. In discs that move linearly or swing on a hinge or trunnion, the disc comes into contact with the seat only when the valve is shut. In disks that rotate, the seat is always in contact with the disk, but the area of contact changes as the disc is turned. The seat always remains stationary relative to the body.\nSeats are classified by whether they are cut directly into the body, or if they are made of a different material:\nA closed soft seated valve is much less liable to leak when shut while hard seated valves are more durable. Gate, globe, and check valves are usually hard seated while butterfly, ball, plug, and diaphragm valves are usually soft seated.\nStem.\nThe stem transmits motion from the handle or controlling device to the disc. The stem typically passes through the bonnet when present. In some cases, the stem and the disc can be combined in one piece, or the stem and the handle are combined in one piece.\nThe motion transmitted by the stem may be a linear force, a rotational torque, or some combination of these (Angle valve using torque reactor pin and Hub Assembly). The valve and stem can be threaded such that the stem can be screwed into or out of the valve by turning it in one direction or the other, thus moving the disc back or forth inside the body. Packing is often used between the stem and the bonnet to maintain a seal. Some valves have no external control and do not need a stem as in most check valves.\nValves whose disc is between the seat and the stem and where the stem moves in a direction into the valve to shut it are normally-seated or front seated. Valves whose seat is between the disc and the stem and where the stem moves in a direction out of the valve to shut it are reverse-seated or back seated. These terms don't apply to valves with no stem or valves using rotors.\nGaskets.\nGaskets are the mechanical seals, or packings, used to prevent the leakage of a gas or fluids from valves.\nValve balls.\nA valve ball is also used for severe duty, high-pressure, high-tolerance applications. They are typically made of stainless steel, titanium, Stellite, Hastelloy, brass, or nickel. They can also be made of different types of plastic, such as ABS, PVC, PP or PVDF.\nSpring.\nMany valves have a spring for spring-loading, to normally shift the disc into some position by default but allow control to reposition the disc. Relief valves commonly use a spring to keep the valve shut, but allow excessive pressure to force the valve open against the spring-loading. Coil springs are normally used. Typical spring materials include zinc plated steel, stainless steel, and for high temperature applications Inconel X750.\nTrim.\nThe internal elements of a valve are collectively referred to as a valve's trim. According to API Standards 600, \"Steel Gate Valve-Flanged and Butt-welding Ends, Bolted Bonnets\", the trim consists of stem, seating surface in the body, gate seating surface, bushing or a deposited weld for the backseat and stem hole guide, and small internal parts that normally contact the service fluid, excluding the pin that is used to make a stem-to-gate connection (this pin shall be made of an austenitic stainless steel material).\nValve operating positions.\nValve positions are operating conditions determined by the position of the disc or rotor in the valve. Some valves are made to be operated in a gradual change between two or more positions. Return valves and non-return valves allow fluid to move in 2 or 1 directions respectively.\nTwo-port valves.\nOperating positions for 2-port valves can be either shut (closed) so that no flow at all goes through, fully open for maximum flow, or sometimes partially open to any degree in between. Many valves are not designed to precisely control intermediate degree of flow; such valves are considered to be either open or shut. Some valves are specially designed to regulate varying amounts of flow. Such valves have been called by various names such as \"regulating\", \"throttling\", \"metering\", or \"needle valves\". For example, needle valves have elongated conically tapered discs and matching seats for fine flow control. For some valves, there may be a mechanism to indicate by how much the valve is open, but in many cases other indications of flow rate are used, such as separate flow meters.\nIn plants with remote-controlled process operation, such as oil refineries and petrochemical plants, some 2-way valves can be designated as normally closed (NC) or normally open (NO) during regular operation. Examples of normally closed valves are \"sampling valves\", which are only opened while a sample is taken. Other examples of normally closed valves are emergency shutdown valves, which are kept open when the system is in operation and will automatically shut by taking away the power supply. This happens when there is a problem with a unit or a section of a fluid system such as a leak in order to isolate the problem from the rest of the system. Examples of normally-open valves are purge-gas supply valves or emergency-relief valves. When there is a problem these valves open (by switching them 'off') causing the unit to be flushed and emptied.\nAlthough many 2-way valves are made in which the flow can go in either direction between the two ports, when a valve is placed into a certain application, flow is often expected to go from one certain port on the upstream side of the valve, to the other port on the downstream side. Pressure regulators are variations of valves in which flow is controlled to produce a certain downstream pressure, if possible. They are often used to control flow of gas from a gas cylinder. A back-pressure regulator is a variation of a valve in which flow is controlled to maintain a certain upstream pressure, if possible.\nThree-port valves.\nValves with three ports serve many different functions. A few of the possibilities are listed here.\nThree-way ball valves come with T- or L-shaped fluid passageways inside the rotor. The T valve might be used to permit connection of one inlet to either or both outlets or connection of the two outlets. The L valve could be used to permit disconnection of both or connection of either but not both of two inlets to one outlet.\n\"Shuttle valves\" automatically connect the higher pressure inlet to the outlet while (in some configurations) preventing flow from one inlet to the other.\n\"Single handle mixer valves\" produce a variable mixture of hot and cold water at a variable flow rate under control of a single handle.\n\"Thermostatic mixing valves\" mix hot and cold water to produce a constant temperature in the presence of variable pressures and temperatures on the two input ports.\nFour-port valves.\nA 4-port valve is a valve whose body has four ports equally spaced round the body and the disc has two passages to connect adjacent ports. It is operated with two positions.\nIt can be used to isolate and to simultaneously bypass a sampling cylinder installed on a pressurized water line. It is useful to take a fluid sample without affecting the pressure of a hydraulic system and to avoid degassing (no leak, no gas loss or air entry, no external contamination)...\nControl.\nMany valves are controlled manually with a handle attached to the stem. If the handle is turned ninety degrees between operating positions, the valve is called a quarter-turn valve. Butterfly, ball valves, and plug valves are often quarter-turn valves. If the handle is circular with the stem as the axis of rotation in the center of the circle, then the handle is called a handwheel. Valves can also be controlled by actuators attached to the stem. They can be electromechanical actuators such as an electric motor or solenoid, pneumatic actuators which are controlled by air pressure, or hydraulic actuators which are controlled by the pressure of a liquid such as oil or water. Actuators can be used for the purposes of automatic control such as in washing machine cycles, remote control such as the use of a centralised control room, or because manual control is too difficult such as when the valve is very large. Pneumatic actuators and hydraulic actuators need pressurised air or liquid lines to supply the actuator: an inlet line and an outlet line. Pilot valves are valves which are used to control other valves. Pilot valves in the actuator lines control the supply of air or liquid going to the actuators.\nThe fill valve in a toilet water tank is a liquid level-actuated valve. When a high water level is reached, a mechanism shuts the valve which fills the tank.\nIn some valve designs, the pressure of the flow fluid itself or pressure difference of the flow fluid between the ports automatically controls flow through the valve.\nOther considerations.\nValves are typically rated for maximum temperature and pressure by the manufacturer. The wetted materials in a valve are usually identified also. Some valves rated at very high pressures are available. When a designer, engineer, or user decides to use a valve for an application, he/she should ensure the rated maximum temperature and pressure are never exceeded and that the wetted materials are compatible with the fluid the valve interior is exposed to. In Europe, valve design and pressure ratings are subject to statutory regulation under the Pressure Equipment Directive 97/23/EC (PED).\nSome fluid system designs, especially in chemical or power plants, are schematically represented in piping and instrumentation diagrams. In such diagrams, different types of valves are represented by certain symbols.\nValves in good condition should be leak-free. However, valves may eventually wear out from use and develop a leak, either between the inside and outside of the valve or, when the valve is shut to stop flow, between the disc and the seat. A particle trapped between the seat and disc could also cause such leakage.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He portrayed the attack as God's retaliation for suffering imposed on Muslims, particularly those in Palestine. Bin Laden did not claim responsibility for the attacks in the recording.\nDecember 13, 2001.\nOn November 10, 2001, U.S. military forces in Jalalabad found a video tape of bin Laden.\nOn December 13, 2001, the United States State Department released a video tape apparently showing bin Laden speaking with Khaled al-Harbi and other associates, somewhere in Afghanistan, before the U.S. invasion had driven the Taliban regime from Kandahar. The State Department stated that the tape was captured by U.S. forces in Afghanistan during a raid on a house in Jalalabad. The tape was aired with an accompanying English translation. In this translation, Osama bin Laden displays knowledge of the timing of the actual attack a few days in advance; the translation attributes the following lines to bin Laden:\n\"we calculated in advance the number of casualties from the enemy, who would be killed based on the position of the tower. We calculated that the floors that would be hit would be three or four floors. I was the most optimistic of them all... We had notification since the previous Thursday that the event would take place that day. We had finished our work that day and had the radio on... Muhammad (Atta) from the Egyptian family (\"meaning the Al Qaida Egyptian group\"), was in charge of the group... The brothers, who conducted the operation, all they knew was that they have a martyrdom operation and we asked each of them to go to America but they didn't know anything about the operation, not even one letter. But they were trained and we did not reveal the operation to them until they are there and just before they boarded the planes.\"\nOn December 20, 2001, German TV channel \"Das Erste\" broadcast an analysis of the White House's translation of the videotape. On the program \"Monitor\", two independent translators and an expert on oriental studies found the White House's translation to be both inaccurate and manipulative stating \"At the most important places where it is held to prove the guilt of bin Laden, it is not identical with the Arabic\" and that the words used that indicate foreknowledge can not be heard at all in the original. Prof. Gernot Rotter, professor of Islamic and Arabic Studies at the Asia-Africa Institute at the University of Hamburg said \"The American translators who listened to the tapes and transcribed them apparently wrote a lot of things in that they wanted to hear but that cannot be heard on the tape no matter how many times you listen to it.\"\nIn the recording, bin Laden describes attacks by the United States against Islamic people. He describes his message as a review of events following 9/11, and in this statement, he neither admits nor denies responsibility for the attacks.\nFebruary 11, 2003.\nColin Powell told a United States Senate panel that he'd reviewed a transcript of a message from bin Laden stating that he was in \"a partnership with Iraq\", which was to be broadcast on al Jazeera. Al Jazeera initially said they did not have the tape, but then said they received it the same day and broadcast it that evening at 8pm GMT. The quality of the recording was said to sound like bin Laden and to be \"quite good\" by \"The Guardian\" but \"poor quality\" by the BBC.\nOctober 29, 2004.\nShortly before the U.S. presidential election on October 29, 2004, Arab television network al Jazeera broadcast an 18-minute video tape of Osama bin Laden, addressed to citizens of the United States. According to the English translation distributed by the BBC and other media outlets, he tells viewers he personally directed the 19 hijackers, and describes his motivation:\nI will explain to you the reasons behind these events, and I will tell you the truth about the moments when this decision was taken, so that you can reflect on it. God knows that the plan of striking the towers had not occurred to us, but the idea came to me when things went just too far with the American-Israeli alliance's oppression and atrocities against our people in Palestine and Lebanon.\nBin Laden claimed he was inspired to destroy the World Trade Center after watching the destruction of towers in Lebanon by Israel during the 1982 Lebanon War.\nNovember 3, 2004.\nBin Laden released another video tape, excoriating the West, the United Nations, and Israel, and explaining all of the unfolding events as fundamentally a religious war.\nJanuary 19, 2006.\nAl Jazeera broadcast an audiotape of bin Laden addressing citizens of the United States again.\nApril 23, 2006.\nAl Jazeera broadcast parts of an audiotape. On this tape, bin Laden accuses the Western world of waging a Zionist crusade against Islam. He comments on Hamas, Darfur and the situation in Iraq.\nMay 23, 2006.\nAl Jazeera broadcast a 5-minute audiotape from bin Laden, where he claims he, alone, assigned the hijackers to perform the September 11 attacks. bin Laden comments on the trial of Zacarias Moussaoui, the prisoners in Guantanamo Bay, and the imprisoned journalists Sami al-Hajj and Tayssir Alouni, denying that any of them (apart from a few Guantanamo Bay prisoners) were connected with al-Qaeda.\nBin Laden tells viewers that Zacarias Moussaoui \"had no connection at all with September 11. I am the one in charge of the 19 brothers and I never assigned brother Zacarias to be with them in that mission. I am certain of what I say because I was responsible for entrusting the 19 brothers... with the raids.\"\nJune 30, 2006.\nAn Islamist website posted a recording, in which bin Laden praised Abu Musab al-Zarqawi as a \"lion of Jihad\". The 19-minute video shows a still picture of bin Laden next to video celebrating al-Zarqawi. U.S. officials said that the tape was authentic.\nJuly 14, 2007.\nA few days after the Lal Masjid siege by the Pakistani government (and after a video released by al-Zawahiri), bin Laden released a tape. He was shown with a fatigued expression. He came out in a video clip less than a minute long on a militant website. BBC News reports that it was \"undated and correspondents say it may be re-run footage. Its authenticity also cannot be independently verified.\"\nSeptember 7, 2007.\nOn September 7, 2007 an entirely new videotape of Osama bin Laden was aired. This was his first new appearance in almost three years. In the tape he mentions no acts of terrorism or war against the United States, but criticizes large corporations, Congressional Democrats, the War on Terror, and the PMs of Great Britain. He strongly urges individuals to convert to Islam. In the movie, bin Laden also mentions the new President of France and Global Warming.\nDuring the video, bin Laden's image moves for only a total of 3\u00bd minutes in two segments, staying frozen the rest of the time while his remarks continue. From bin Laden's mention of current events it appeared to indicate the video is recently made and thus also proving bin Laden is still alive, however the mentions of current events occur only in the frozen sections of the tape.\nSeptember 11, 2007.\nA second video appeared purportedly featuring a eulogy by bin Laden to 9/11 hijacker Waleed al-Shehri. In the video, a voice identified as bin Laden's delivers the 14-minute introduction. The voice is heard over a still picture of bin Laden, dressed and groomed as he appears in the September 7, 2007, video. The 33-minute balance of the recording is a video will read by al-Shehri.\nSeptember 20, 2007.\nAn audio tape appeared with bin Laden's voice over previously released footage of him. In the audio tape, bin Laden called on Pakistanis to overthrow President Pervez Musharraf, promising what he called retaliation for the storming of the Red Mosque in the capital, Islamabad, in July.\nNovember 29, 2007.\nAn audio tape appeared purportedly by bin Laden has urged European countries to end their military involvement in Afghanistan.\nDecember 29, 2007.\nIn an audiotape Osama bin Laden warned Iraq's Sunni Arabs against fighting al-Qaeda and vowed to expand the group's Jihad to Israel, threatening \"blood for blood, destruction for destruction.\"\nThe title of this message is \"The Way To Frustrate The Conspiracies.\"\nMarch 19, 2008.\nOn March 19, 2008, an audio tape appeared purportedly by al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden \"threatens\" the EU over the re-printing of a cartoon offensive to Muslims.\nThe title of this message is \"May our Mothers be bereaved of us if we fail to help our Prophet.\"\nMarch 20, 2008.\nOn March 20, 2008, a second audio tape appeared purportedly by al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden urging Palestinian militants to join the insurgency in Iraq.\nMay 16, 2008.\nOn May 16, 2008, an audio tape appeared purportedly by al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden issued to the Western People: \"Reasons of the struggle on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the founding of the occupying state of Israel\" The message is 22 minutes, 41 seconds long. The message addresses the 60th anniversary of the founding of the state of Israel.\nMay 18, 2008.\nOn May 18, 2008, a second audio tape appeared purportedly by al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden issued 'A very strong statement to the Islamic nation and Muslims'. The second in three days, once again is an audio message, with no new imagery of bin Laden seen. A video version of the message was released showing an older still image of bin Laden while an audio message plays in the background.\nJanuary 14, 2009.\nOn January 14, 2009, a new audio recording purportedly by bin Laden posted on Islamist websites called for a new jihad over the Israeli offensive in Gaza and said the 2008 financial crisis has exposed the waning influence of the United States in world affairs and that it will in turn weaken its ally Israel. The recording was accompanied by a still photo of bin Laden superimposed over the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem.\nJune 3, 2009.\nAccording to a recording aired by Al Jazeera on June 3, bin Laden made a statement against President Barack Obama.\nSeptember 13, 2009.\nOn September 13, 2009, an audio recording purportedly by Osama bin Laden was released on an Islamist website.\nFor a transcript, see .\nSeptember 25, 2009.\nOn September 25, 2009, a forum participant posted to a jihadist website links to download an audio statement from al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Ladin. The statement, entitled \"A Message From Shaykh Osama bin Ladin to the People of Europe,\" is 4 minutes, 47 seconds, and in Arabic with German and English subtitles available. The video shows a still photograph of bin Laden.\nFor a transcript, see \nJanuary 24, 2010.\nNew audio tape released to Al Jazeera news features a voice claiming to be Osama bin Laden taking credit for the attempted bombing by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab. The authenticity of the tape has not yet been verified.\nJanuary 29, 2010.\nA tape allegedly (remains unverified) from bin Laden was released by Al Jazeera, in which the leader of al-Qaeda excoriated the U.S. for its reluctance to address climate change. Bin Laden called for a worldwide boycott of American goods and the United States dollar in order to have a huge impact on the American economy.\nMarch 25, 2010.\nAnother new audio tape allegedly from bin Laden was released by Al Jazeera. In this tape, the leader of al-Qaeda threatened that the execution of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed would result in al-Qaeda indefinitely murdering Americans in the event of their \"falling into our hands\".\nOctober 1, 2010.\nAn audiotape allegedly featuring the voice of bin Laden surfaced on the Internet and addresses the flooding in Pakistan. The 11-minute tape, posted on militant websites Friday, focused on relief efforts and what can be done to prevent future natural disasters. In the recording, bin Laden reportedly urges a change in how governments execute relief work and calls for the creation of a relief group to study Muslim regions located near rivers and low-lying areas. He also calls for a greater investment in agriculture. The U.S.-based SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors jihadi forums, says the latest message is heard in a video featuring a photograph of bin Laden superimposed over images of aid distribution.\nOctober 2, 2010.\nThe audio of a follow-up speech allegedly by Osama bin Laden was released onto the internet. The title of the speech was \"Help Your Pakistani Brothers\" in which he expressed his feeling that the response of Arab and Muslim leaders to the Pakistani's affected by the flooding \"did not match the level of the disaster\" and that more people are affected by climate change than wars. The authenticity of the tape has not been independently verified.\nJanuary 21, 2011.\nOn January 21, 2011, Osama bin Laden said the release of French hostages depends on a pullout of France's soldiers in Afghanistan and warned Paris of a \"high price\" for its policies. \"We repeat the same message to you: The release of your prisoners in the hands of our brothers is linked to the withdrawal of your soldiers from our country,\" said the speaker on the audiotape broadcast on Al Jazeera television. This was the final tape released by Bin Laden prior to the confirmation of his death on May 2, 2011. A new audio message that Osama Bin Laden recorded before his death was released on May 7, 2011.\nMay 19, 2011.\nA recording purported to have been made by Osama bin Laden shortly before he died was released by al-Qaeda. In the message, he praised the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt during the Arab Spring and speaks of a \"rare historic opportunity\" for Muslims to rise up. The 12-minute audio message came out on a video posted on Islamist websites, and has been \ntranslated by the SITE Institute.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "32759", "revid": "24278802", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32759", "title": "Vice President of the United States", "text": "Second-highest constitutional office in the United States\nThe vice president of the United States (VPOTUS, or informally, veep) is the second-highest ranking office in the executive branch of the U.S. federal government, after the president of the United States, and ranks first in the presidential line of succession. The vice president is also an officer in the legislative branch, as the president of the Senate. In this capacity, the vice president is empowered to preside over the United States Senate, but may not vote except to cast a tie-breaking vote. The vice president is elected at the same time as the president to a four-year term of office by the people of the United States through the Electoral College, but the electoral votes are cast separately for these two offices. Following the passage in 1967 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the US Constitution, a vacancy in the office of vice president may be filled by presidential nomination and confirmation by a majority vote in both houses of Congress. This was based on the Tyler Precedent set in 1841 when John Tyler became the first vice president to take over for a deceased president following the death of William Henry Harrison.\nThe modern vice presidency is a position of significant power and is widely seen as an integral part of a president's administration. The presidential candidate selects the candidate for the vice presidency as their running mate in the lead-up to the presidential election. While the exact nature of the role varies in each administration, since the vice president's service in office is by election, the president cannot dismiss the vice president, and the personal working-relationship with the president varies, most modern vice presidents serve as a key presidential advisor, governing partner, and representative of the president. The vice president is also a statutory member of the United States Cabinet and United States National Security Council and thus plays a significant role in executive government and national security matters. As the vice president's role within the executive branch has expanded, the legislative branch role has contracted; for example, vice presidents now preside over the Senate only infrequently.\nThe role of the vice presidency has changed dramatically since the office was created during the 1787 Constitutional Convention. Originally something of an afterthought, the vice presidency was considered an insignificant office for much of the nation's history, especially after the Twelfth Amendment meant that vice presidents were no longer the runners-up in the presidential election. The vice president's role began steadily growing in importance during the 1930s, with the Office of the Vice President being created in the executive branch in 1939, and has since grown much further. Due to its increase in power and prestige, the vice presidency is now often considered to be a stepping stone to the presidency. Since the 1970s, the vice president has been afforded an official residence at Number One Observatory Circle.\nThe Constitution does not expressly assign the vice presidency to a branch of the government, causing a dispute among scholars about which branch the office belongs to (the executive, the legislative, both, or neither). The modern view of the vice president as an officer of the executive branch\u2014one isolated almost entirely from the legislative branch\u2014is due in large part to the assignment of executive authority to the vice president by either the president or Congress. Nevertheless, many vice presidents have previously served in Congress, and are often tasked with helping to advance an administration's legislative priorities. John Adams was the country's first ever vice president. JD Vance is the 50th and current vice president since January 20, 2025.\nHistory and development.\nConstitutional Convention.\nNo mention of an office of vice president was made at the 1787 Constitutional Convention until near the end, when an eleven-member committee on \"Leftover Business\" proposed a method of electing the chief executive (president). Delegates had previously considered the selection of the Senate's presiding officer, deciding that \"the Senate shall choose its own President\", and had agreed that this official would be designated the executive's immediate successor. They had also considered the mode of election of the executive but had not reached consensus. This all changed on September 4, when the committee recommended that the nation's chief executive be elected by an Electoral College, with each state having a number of presidential electors equal to the sum of that state's allocation of representatives and senators.\nRecognizing that loyalty to one's individual state outweighed loyalty to the new federation, the Constitution's framers assumed individual electors would be inclined to choose a candidate from their own state (a so-called \"favorite son\" candidate) over one from another state. So they created the office of vice president and required the electors to vote for two candidates, at least one of whom must be from outside the elector's state, believing that the second vote would be cast for a candidate of national character. Additionally, to guard against the possibility that electors might strategically waste their second votes, it was specified that the first runner-up would become vice president.\nThe resultant method of electing the president and vice president, spelled out in , allocated to each state a number of electors equal to the combined total of its Senate and House of Representatives membership. Each elector was allowed to vote for two people for president (rather than for both president and vice president), but could not differentiate between their first and second choice for the presidency. The person receiving the greatest number of votes (provided it was an absolute majority of the whole number of electors) would be president, while the individual who received the next largest number of votes became vice president. If there were a tie for first or for second place, or if no one won a majority of votes, the president and vice president would be selected by means of contingent elections protocols stated in the clause.\nEarly vice presidents and Twelfth Amendment.\nThe first two vice presidents, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, both of whom gained the office by virtue of being runners-up in presidential contests, presided regularly over Senate proceedings and did much to shape the role of Senate president. Several 19th-century vice presidents\u2014such as George Dallas, Levi Morton, and Garret Hobart\u2014followed their example and led effectively, while others were rarely present.\nThe emergence of political parties and nationally coordinated election campaigns during the 1790s (which the Constitution's framers had not contemplated) quickly frustrated the election plan in the original Constitution. In the election of 1796, Federalist candidate John Adams won the presidency, but his bitter rival, Democratic-Republican candidate Thomas Jefferson, came second and thus won the vice presidency. As a result, the president and vice president were from opposing parties; and Jefferson used the vice presidency to frustrate the president's policies. Then, four years later, in the election of 1800, Jefferson and fellow Democratic-Republican Aaron Burr each received 73 electoral votes. In the contingent election that followed, Jefferson finally won the presidency on the 36th ballot, leaving Burr the vice presidency. Afterward, the system was overhauled through the Twelfth Amendment in time to be used in the 1804 election.\n19th and early 20th centuries.\nFor much of its existence, the office of vice president was seen as little more than a minor position. John Adams, the first vice president, was the first of many frustrated by the \"complete insignificance\" of the office. To his wife Abigail Adams he wrote, \"My country has in its wisdom contrived for me the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man... or his imagination contrived or his imagination conceived; and as I can do neither good nor evil, I must be borne away by others and met the common fate.\" Thomas R. Marshall, who served as vice president from 1913 to 1921 under President Woodrow Wilson, lamented: \"Once there were two brothers. One ran away to sea; the other was elected Vice President of the United States. And nothing was heard of either of them again.\" His successor, Calvin Coolidge, was so obscure that Major League Baseball sent him free passes that misspelled his name, and a fire marshal failed to recognize him when Coolidge's Washington residence was evacuated. John Nance Garner, who served as vice president from 1933 to 1941 under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, claimed that the vice presidency \"isn't worth a pitcher of warm piss\". Harry Truman, who also served as vice president under Franklin Roosevelt, said the office was as \"useful as a cow's fifth teat\". Walter Bagehot remarked in \"The English Constitution\" that \"[t]he framers of the Constitution expected that the \"vice\"-president would be elected by the Electoral College as the second wisest man in the country. The vice-presidentship being a sinecure, a second-rate man agreeable to the wire-pullers is always smuggled in. The chance of succession to the presidentship is too distant to be thought of.\"\nWhen the Whig Party asked Daniel Webster to run for the vice presidency on Zachary Taylor's ticket, he replied \"I do not propose to be buried until I am really dead and in my coffin.\" This was the second time Webster declined the office, which William Henry Harrison had first offered to him. Ironically, both the presidents making the offer to Webster died in office, meaning the three-time candidate would have become president had he accepted either. Since presidents rarely die in office, however, the better preparation for the presidency was considered to be the office of Secretary of State, in which Webster served under Harrison, Tyler, and later, Taylor's successor, Fillmore.\nIn the first hundred years of the United States' existence no fewer than seven proposals to abolish the office of vice president were advanced. The first such constitutional amendment was presented by Samuel W. Dana in 1800; it was defeated by a vote of 27 to 85 in the United States House of Representatives. The second, introduced by United States Senator James Hillhouse in 1808, was also defeated. During the late 1860s and 1870s, five additional amendments were proposed. One advocate, James Mitchell Ashley, opined that the office of vice president was \"superfluous\" and dangerous.\nGarret Hobart, the first vice president under William McKinley, was one of the very few vice presidents at this time who played an important role in the administration. A close confidant and adviser of the president, Hobart was called \"Assistant President\". However, until 1919, vice presidents were not included in meetings of the President's Cabinet. This precedent was broken by Woodrow Wilson when he asked Thomas R. Marshall to preside over Cabinet meetings while Wilson was in France negotiating the Treaty of Versailles. President Warren G. Harding also invited Calvin Coolidge to meetings. The next vice president, Charles G. Dawes, did not seek to attend Cabinet meetings under President Coolidge, declaring that \"the precedent might prove injurious to the country.\" Vice President Charles Curtis regularly attended Cabinet meetings on the invitation of President Herbert Hoover.\nEmergence of the modern vice presidency.\nIn 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt raised the stature of the office by renewing the practice of inviting the vice president to cabinet meetings, which every president since has maintained. Roosevelt's first vice president, John Nance Garner, broke with him over the \"court-packing\" issue early in his second term, and became Roosevelt's leading critic. At the start of that term, on January 20, 1937, Garner had been the first vice president to be sworn into office on the Capitol steps in the same ceremony with the president, a tradition that continues. Prior to that time, vice presidents were traditionally inaugurated at a separate ceremony in the Senate chamber. Gerald Ford and Nelson Rockefeller, who were each appointed to the office under the terms of the 25th Amendment, were inaugurated in the House and Senate chambers respectively.\nAt the 1940 Democratic National Convention, Roosevelt selected his own running mate, Henry Wallace, instead of leaving the nomination to the convention, when he wanted Garner replaced. He then gave Wallace major responsibilities during World War II. However, after numerous policy disputes between Wallace and other Roosevelt Administration and Democratic Party officials, he was denied re-nomination at the 1944 Democratic National Convention. Harry Truman was selected instead. During his -day vice presidency, Truman was never informed about any war or post-war plans, including the Manhattan Project. Truman had no visible role in the Roosevelt administration outside of his congressional responsibilities and met with the president only a few times during his tenure as vice president. Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945, and Truman succeeded to the presidency (the state of Roosevelt's health had also been kept from Truman). At the time he said, \"I felt like the moon, the stars and all the planets fell on me.\" Determined that no future vice president should be so uninformed upon unexpectedly becoming president, Truman made the vice president a member of the National Security Council, a participant in Cabinet meetings and a recipient of regular security briefings in 1949.\nThe stature of the vice presidency grew again while Richard Nixon was in office (1953\u20131961). He attracted the attention of the media and the Republican Party, when Dwight Eisenhower authorized him to preside at Cabinet meetings in his absence and to assume temporary control of the executive branch, which he did after Eisenhower suffered a heart attack on September 24, 1955, ileitis in June 1956, and a stroke in November 1957. Nixon was also visible on the world stage during his time in office.\nUntil 1961, vice presidents had their offices on Capitol Hill, a formal office in the Capitol itself and a working office in the Russell Senate Office Building. Lyndon B. Johnson was the first vice president to also be given an office in the White House complex, in the Old Executive Office Building. The former Navy Secretary's office in the OEOB has since been designated the \"Ceremonial Office of the Vice President\" and is today used for formal events and press interviews. President Jimmy Carter was the first president to give his vice president, Walter Mondale, an office in the West Wing of the White House, which all vice presidents have since retained. Because of their function as president of the Senate, vice presidents still maintain offices and staff members on Capitol Hill. This change came about because Carter held the view that the office of the vice presidency had historically been a wasted asset and wished to have his vice president involved in the decision-making process. Carter pointedly considered, according to Joel Goldstein, the way Roosevelt treated Truman as \"immoral\".\nAnother factor behind the rise in prestige of the vice presidency was the expanded use of presidential preference primaries for choosing party nominees during the 20th century. By adopting primary voting, the field of candidates for vice president was expanded by both the increased quantity and quality of presidential candidates successful in some primaries, yet who ultimately failed to capture the presidential nomination at the convention.\nAt the start of the 21st century, Dick Cheney (2001\u20132009) held much power within the administration, and frequently made policy decisions on his own, without the knowledge of the president. This rapid growth led to Matthew Yglesias and Bruce Ackerman calling for the abolition of the vice presidency while both of 2008's vice presidential candidates, Sarah Palin and Joe Biden, said they would reduce the role to simply being an adviser to the president.\nConstitutional roles.\nAlthough delegates to the constitutional convention approved establishing the office, with both its executive and senatorial functions, not many understood the office, and so they gave the vice president few duties and little power. Only a few states had an analogous position. Among those that did, New York's constitution provided that \"the lieutenant-governor shall, by virtue of his office, be president of the Senate, and, upon an equal division, have a casting voice in their decisions, but not vote on any other occasion\". As a result, the vice presidency originally had authority in only a few areas, although constitutional amendments have added or clarified some matters.\nPresident of the Senate.\n confers upon the vice president the title \"President of the Senate\", authorizing the vice president to preside over Senate meetings. In this capacity, the vice president is responsible for maintaining order and decorum, recognizing members to speak, and interpreting the Senate's rules, practices, and precedent. With this position also comes the authority to cast a tie-breaking vote. In practice, the number of times vice presidents have exercised this right has varied greatly. Kamala Harris holds the record at 33 votes, followed by John C. Calhoun who had previously held the record at 31 votes; John Adams ranks third with 29. Twelve vice presidents did not cast any tie-breaking votes.\nAs the framers of the Constitution anticipated that the vice president would not always be available to fulfill this responsibility, the Constitution provides that the Senate may elect a president pro tempore (or \"president for a time\") in order to maintain the proper ordering of the legislative process. In practice, since the early 20th century, neither the president of the Senate nor the pro tempore regularly presides; instead, the president pro tempore usually delegates the task to other Senate members. Rule XIX, which governs debate, does not authorize the vice president to participate in debate, and grants only to members of the Senate (and, upon appropriate notice, former presidents of the United States) the privilege of addressing the Senate, without granting a similar privilege to the sitting vice president. Thus, \"Time\" magazine wrote in 1925, during the tenure of Charles G. Dawes, \"once in four years the vice president can make a little speech, and then he is done. For four years he then has to sit in the seat of the silent, attending to speeches ponderous or otherwise, of deliberation or humor.\"\nPresiding over impeachment trials.\nIn their capacity as president of the Senate, the vice president may preside over most impeachment trials of federal officers, although the Constitution does not specifically require it. However, whenever the president of the United States is on trial, the Constitution requires that the chief justice of the United States must preside. This stipulation was designed to avoid the possible conflict of interest in having the vice president preside over the trial for the removal of the one official standing between them and the presidency. In contrast, the Constitution is silent about which federal official would preside were the vice president on trial by the Senate. No vice president has ever been impeached, thus leaving it unclear whether an impeached vice president could, as president of the Senate, preside at their own impeachment trial.\nPresiding over electoral vote counts.\nThe Twelfth Amendment provides that the vice president, in their capacity as the president of the Senate, receives the Electoral College votes, and then, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, opens the sealed votes. The votes are then counted by Congress during a joint session, in accordance with the additional procedures prescribed by the Electoral Count Act and amended by Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act. The former specifies that the president of the Senate presides over the joint session, and the latter clarifies the solely ministerial role the president of the Senate serves in the process. The next such joint session is expected to next take place following the 2028 presidential election, on January 6, 2029 (unless Congress sets a different date by law).\nIn this capacity, four vice presidents have been able to announce their own election to the presidency: John Adams in 1797, Thomas Jefferson in 1801, Martin Van Buren in 1837 and George H. W. Bush in 1989. Conversely, four vice presidents have needed to announce their opponent's election to the presidency: John C. Breckinridge in 1861, Richard Nixon in 1961, Al Gore in 2001, and Kamala Harris in 2025. In 1969, Vice President Hubert Humphrey would have done so as well, following his 1968 loss to Richard Nixon; however, on the date of the congressional joint session, Humphrey was in Norway attending the funeral of Trygve Lie, the first elected Secretary-General of the United Nations. The president pro tempore, Richard Russell, presided in his absence. On February 8, 1933, Vice President Charles Curtis announced the election victory of his successor, House Speaker John Nance Garner, while Garner was seated next to him on the House dais. Similarly, Walter Mondale, in 1981, Dan Quayle, in 1993, and Mike Pence, in 2021, each had to announce their successor's election victory, following their re-election losses.\nSuccessor to the U.S. president.\n stipulates that the vice president takes over the \"powers and duties\" of the presidency in the event of a president's removal, death, resignation, or inability. Even so, it did not clearly state whether the vice president became president or simply acted as president in a case of succession. Debate records from the 1787 Constitutional Convention, along with various participants' later writings on the subject, show that the framers of the Constitution intended that the vice president would temporarily exercise the powers and duties of the office in the event of a president's death, disability or removal, but not actually become the president of the United States in their own right.\nThis understanding was first tested in 1841, following the death of President William Henry Harrison, only days into his term. Harrison's vice president, John Tyler, asserted that under the Constitution, he had succeeded to the presidency, not just to its powers and duties. He had himself sworn in as president and assumed full presidential powers, refusing to acknowledge documents referring to him as \"Acting President\". Although some in Congress denounced Tyler's claim as a violation of the Constitution, he adhered to his position. His view ultimately prevailed as both the Senate and House voted to acknowledge him as president. The Tyler Precedent that a vice president assumes the full title and role of president upon the death, resignation, or removal from office (via impeachment conviction) of their predecessor was codified through the Twenty-fifth Amendment in 1967. Altogether, nine vice presidents have succeeded to the presidency intra-term. In addition to Tyler, they are Millard Fillmore, Andrew Johnson, Chester A. Arthur, Theodore Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge, Harry S. Truman, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Gerald Ford. Four of them\u2014Roosevelt, Coolidge, Truman, and Lyndon B. Johnson\u2014were later elected to full terms of their own.\nFour sitting vice presidents have been elected president: John Adams in 1796, Thomas Jefferson in 1800, Martin Van Buren in 1836, and George H. W. Bush in 1988. Likewise, two former vice presidents have won the presidency, Richard Nixon in 1968 and Joe Biden in 2020. Also, five incumbent vice presidents lost a presidential election: Breckinridge in 1860, Nixon in 1960, Humphrey in 1968, Gore in 2000, and Harris in 2024. Additionally, former vice president Walter Mondale lost in 1984. In total, 15 vice presidents have become president.\nActing president.\nSections 3 and 4 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment provide for situations where the president is temporarily or permanently unable to lead, such as if the president has a surgical procedure, becomes seriously ill or injured, or is otherwise unable to discharge the powers or duties of the presidency. Section3 deals with self-declared incapacity, and Section4 addresses incapacity declared by the joint action of the vice president and of a majority of the Cabinet. While Section4 has never been invoked, Section3 has been invoked on four occasions by three presidents, first in 1985. When invoked on November 19, 2021, Kamala Harris became the first woman in U.S. history to have presidential powers and duties.\nSections 3 and 4 were added because there was ambiguity in the ArticleII succession clause regarding a disabled president, including what constituted an \"inability\", who determined the existence of an inability, and if a vice president became president for the rest of the presidential term in the case of an inability or became merely \"acting president\". During the 19th century and first half of the 20th century, several presidents experienced periods of severe illness, physical disability or injury, some lasting for weeks or months. During these times, even though the nation needed effective presidential leadership, no vice president wanted to seem like a usurper, and so power was never transferred. After President Dwight D. Eisenhower openly addressed his health issues and made it a point to enter into an agreement with Vice President Richard Nixon that provided for Nixon to act on his behalf if Eisenhower became unable to provide effective presidential leadership (Nixon did informally assume some of the president's duties for several weeks on each of three occasions when Eisenhower was ill), discussions began in Congress about clearing up the Constitution's ambiguity on the subject.\nModern roles.\nThe present-day power of the office flows primarily from formal and informal delegations of authority from the president and Congress. These delegations can vary in significance; for example, the vice president is a statutory member of both the National Security Council and the board of regents of the Smithsonian Institution. The extent of the roles and functions of the vice president depend on the specific relationship between the president and the vice president, but often include tasks such as drafter and spokesperson for the administration's policies, adviser to the president, and being a symbol of American concern or support. The influence of the vice president in these roles depends almost entirely on the characteristics of the particular administration.\nPresidential advisor.\nMost recent vice presidents have been viewed as important presidential advisors. Walter Mondale, unlike his immediate predecessors, did not want specific responsibilities to be delegated to him. Mondale believed, as he wrote President-elect Jimmy Carter a memo following the 1976 election, that his most important role would be as a \"general adviser\" to the president. Al Gore was an important adviser to President Bill Clinton on matters of foreign policy and the environment. Dick Cheney was widely regarded as one of President George W. Bush's closest confidants. Joe Biden asked President Barack Obama to let him always be the \"last person in the room\" when a big decision was made; later, as president himself, Biden adopted this model with his own vice president, Kamala Harris.\nGoverning partner.\nRecent vice presidents have been delegated authority by presidents to handle significant issue areas independently. Joe Biden (who has held the office of President and Vice President of the United States) has observed that the presidency is \"too big anymore for any one man or woman\". Dick Cheney was considered to hold a tremendous amount of power and frequently made policy decisions on his own, without the knowledge of the president. Biden was assigned by Barack Obama to oversee Iraq policy; Obama was said to have said, \"Joe, you do Iraq.\" In February 2020, Donald Trump appointed Mike Pence to lead his response to COVID-19. In March 2021, President Biden put Kamala Harris in charge of addressing the influx of migrants at the U.S.\u2013Mexico border.\nCongressional liaison.\nThe vice president is often an important liaison between the administration and Congress, especially in situations where the president has not previously served in Congress or served only briefly. Vice presidents are often selected as running mates in part due to their legislative relationships, notably including Richard Nixon, Lyndon Johnson, Walter Mondale, Dick Cheney, Joe Biden, and Mike Pence among others. In recent years, Dick Cheney held weekly meetings in the Vice President's Room at the United States Capitol, Joe Biden played a key role in bipartisan budget negotiations, and Mike Pence often met with House and Senate Republicans. Kamala Harris presided over a 50\u201350 split Senate during the 117th Congress, which provided her with a key role in passing legislation.\nRepresentative at events.\nUnder the American system of government the president is both head of state and head of government, and the ceremonial duties of the former position are often delegated to the vice president. The vice president will on occasion represent the president and the U.S. government at state funerals abroad, or at various events in the United States. This often is the most visible role of the vice president. The vice president may also meet with other heads of state at times when the administration wishes to demonstrate concern or support but cannot send the president personally.\nNational Security Council member.\nSince 1949, the vice president has legally been a member of the National Security Council. Harry Truman, having not been told about any war or post-war plans during his vice presidency (notably the Manhattan Project), recognized that upon assuming the presidency a vice president needed to be already informed on such issues. Modern vice presidents have also been included in the president's daily intelligence briefings and frequently participate in meetings in the Situation Room with the president.\nSelection process.\nEligibility.\nTo be constitutionally eligible to serve as the nation's vice president, a person must, according to the Twelfth Amendment, meet the eligibility requirements to become president (which are stated in ). Thus, to serve as vice president, an individual must:\nA person who meets the above qualifications is still disqualified from holding the office of vice president under the following conditions:\nNomination.\nThe vice presidential candidates of the major national political parties are formally selected by each party's quadrennial nominating convention, following the selection of the party's presidential candidate. The official process is identical to the one by which the presidential candidates are chosen, with delegates placing the names of candidates into nomination, followed by a ballot in which candidates must receive a majority to secure the party's nomination.\nIn modern practice, the presidential nominee has considerable influence on the decision, and since the mid-20th century it became customary for that person to select a preferred running mate, who is then nominated and accepted by the convention. Prior to Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940, only two presidents\u2014Andrew Jackson in 1832 and Abraham Lincoln in 1864\u2014had done so. In recent years, with the presidential nomination usually being a foregone conclusion as the result of the primary process, the selection of a vice presidential candidate is often announced prior to the actual balloting for the presidential candidate, and sometimes before the beginning of the convention itself. The most recent presidential nominee not to name a vice presidential choice, leaving the matter up to the convention, was Democrat Adlai Stevenson in 1956. The convention chose Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver over Massachusetts Senator (and later president) John F. Kennedy. At the tumultuous 1972 Democratic convention, presidential nominee George McGovern selected Missouri Senator Thomas Eagleton as his running mate, but numerous other candidates were either nominated from the floor or received votes during the balloting. Eagleton nevertheless received a majority of the votes and the nomination, though he later resigned from the ticket, resulting in Sargent Shriver from Maryland becoming McGovern's final running mate; both lost to the Nixon\u2013Agnew ticket by a wide margin, carrying only Massachusetts and the District of Columbia.\nDuring times in a presidential election cycle before the identity of the presidential nominee is clear, including cases where the presidential nomination is still in doubt as the convention approaches, campaigns for the two positions may become intertwined. In 1976, Ronald Reagan, who was trailing President Gerald Ford in the presidential delegate count, announced prior to the Republican National Convention that, if nominated, he would select Pennsylvania Senator Richard Schweiker as his running mate. Reagan was the first presidential aspirant to announce his selection for vice president before the beginning of the convention. Reagan's supporters then unsuccessfully sought to amend the convention rules so that Gerald Ford would be required to name his vice presidential running mate in advance as well. This move backfired to a degree, as Schweiker's relatively liberal voting record alienated many of the more conservative delegates who were considering a challenge to party delegate selection rules to improve Reagan's chances. In the end, Ford narrowly won the presidential nomination and Reagan's selection of Schweiker became moot.\nIn the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries, which pitted Hillary Clinton against Barack Obama, Clinton suggested a Clinton\u2013Obama ticket with Obama in the vice president slot, which she said would be \"unstoppable\" against the presumptive Republican nominee. Obama rejected the offer outright, saying, \"I want everybody to be absolutely clear. I'm not running for vice president. I'm running for president of the United States of America,\" adding, \"With all due respect. I won twice as many states as Senator Clinton. I've won more of the popular vote than Senator Clinton. I have more delegates than Senator Clinton. So, I don't know how somebody who's in second place is offering vice presidency to the person who's in first place.\" Obama said the nomination process would have to be a choice between himself and Clinton, saying \"I don't want anybody here thinking that 'Somehow, maybe I can get both'\", by nominating Clinton and assuming he would be her running mate. Some suggested that it was a ploy by the Clinton campaign to denigrate Obama as less qualified for the presidency. Later, when Obama became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, former president Jimmy Carter cautioned against Clinton being picked as the vice presidential nominee on the ticket, saying \"I think it would be the worst mistake that could be made. That would just accumulate the negative aspects of both candidates\", citing opinion polls showing 50% of US voters with a negative view of Hillary Clinton.\nSelection criteria.\nThough the vice president does not need to have any political experience, most major-party vice presidential nominees are current or former United States senators or representatives, with the occasional nominee being a current or former governor, a high-ranking former military officer (active military officers being prohibited under US law from holding political office), or a holder of a major position within the Executive branch. In addition, the vice presidential nominee has always been an official resident of a different state than the presidential nominee. While nothing in the Constitution prohibits a presidential candidate and his or her running mate being from the same state, the \"inhabitant clause\" of the Twelfth Amendment does mandate that every presidential elector must cast a ballot for at least one candidate who is not from their own state. Prior to the 2000 election, both George W. Bush and Dick Cheney lived in and voted in Texas. To avoid creating a potential problem for Texas's electors, Cheney changed his residency back to Wyoming prior to the campaign.\nOften, the presidential nominee will name a vice presidential candidate who will bring geographic or ideological balance to the ticket or appeal to a particular constituency. The vice presidential candidate might also be chosen on the basis of traits the presidential candidate is perceived to lack, or on the basis of name recognition. To foster party unity, popular runners-up in the presidential nomination process are commonly considered. While this selection process may enhance the chances of success for a national ticket, in the past it often resulted in the vice presidential nominee representing regions, constituencies, or ideologies at odds with those of the presidential candidate. As a result, vice presidents were often excluded from the policy-making process of the new administration. Many times their relationships with the president and his staff were aloof, non-existent, or even adversarial.\nHistorically, the vice presidential nominee was usually a second-tier politician, chosen either to appease the party's minority faction, satisfy party bosses, or to secure a key state. Factors playing a role in the selection included: geographic and ideological balance, widening a presidential candidate's appeal to voters from outside their regional base or wing of the party. Candidates from electoral-vote rich swing states were usually preferred. A 2016 study, which examined vice-presidential candidates over the period 1884\u20132012, found that vice presidential candidates increased their tickets\u2019 performance in their home states by 2.67 percentage points on average.\nElection.\nThe vice president is elected indirectly by the voters of each state and the District of Columbia through the Electoral College, a body of electors formed every four years for the sole purpose of electing the president and vice president to concurrent four-year terms. Each state is entitled to a number of electors equal to the size of its total delegation in both houses of Congress. Additionally, the Twenty-third Amendment provides that the District of Columbia is entitled to the number it would have if it were a state, but in no case more than that of the least populous state. Currently, all states and D.C. select their electors based on a popular election held on Election Day. In all but two states, the party whose presidential\u2013vice presidential ticket receives a plurality of popular votes in the state has its entire slate of elector nominees chosen as the state's electors. Maine and Nebraska deviate from this winner-take-all practice, awarding two electors to the statewide winner and one to the winner in each congressional district.\nOn the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December, about six weeks after the election, the electors convene in their respective states (and in Washington D.C.) to vote for president and, on a separate ballot, for vice president. The certified results are opened and counted during a joint session of Congress, held in the first week of January. A candidate who receives an absolute majority of electoral votes for vice president (currently 270 of 538) is declared the winner. If no candidate has a majority, the Senate must meet to elect a vice president using a contingent election procedure in which senators, casting votes individually, choose between the two candidates who received the most electoral votes for vice president. For a candidate to win the contingent election, they must receive votes from an absolute majority of senators (currently 51 of 100).\nThere has been only one vice presidential contingent election since the process was created by the Twelfth Amendment. It occurred on February 8, 1837, after no candidate received a majority of the electoral votes cast for vice president in the 1836 election. By a 33\u201317 vote, Richard M. Johnson (Martin Van Buren's running mate) was elected the nation's ninth vice president over Francis Granger (William Henry Harrison's and Daniel Webster's running mate).\nTenure.\nInauguration.\nPursuant to the Twentieth Amendment, the vice president's term of office begins at noon on January 20, as does the president's. The first presidential and vice presidential terms to begin on this date, known as Inauguration Day, were the second terms of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Vice President John Nance Garner in 1937. Previously, Inauguration Day was on March 4. As a result of the date change, both men's first terms (1933\u20131937) were short of four years by days.\nAlso in 1937, the vice president's swearing-in ceremony was held on the Inaugural platform on the Capitol's east front immediately before the president's swearing in. Up until then, most vice presidents took the oath of office in the Senate chamber, prior to the president's swearing-in ceremony. Although the Constitution contains the specific wording of the presidential oath, it contains only a general requirement, in ArticleVI, that the vice president and other government officers shall take an oath or affirmation to support the Constitution. The current form, which has been used since 1884 reads:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I, (\"first name last name\"), do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.\nTerm of office.\nThe term of office for both the vice president and the president is four years. While the Twenty-Second Amendment sets a limit on the number of times an individual can be elected to the presidency (two), there is no such limitation on the office of vice president, meaning an eligible person could hold the office as long as voters continued to vote for electors who in turn would reelect the person to the office; one could even serve under different presidents. This has happened twice: George Clinton (1805\u20131812) served under both Thomas Jefferson and James Madison; and John C. Calhoun (1825\u20131832) served under John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson. Additionally, neither the Constitution's eligibility provisions nor the Twenty-second Amendment's presidential term limit explicitly disqualify a twice-elected president from serving as vice president, though it is arguably prohibited by the last sentence of the Twelfth Amendment: \"But no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.\" As of the 2020 election cycle, however, no former president has tested the amendment's legal restrictions or meaning by running for the vice presidency.\nImpeachment.\n of the Constitution allows for the removal of federal officials, including the vice president, from office for \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\". No vice president has ever been impeached.\nVacancies.\nPrior to the ratification of the Twenty-fifth Amendment in 1967, no constitutional provision existed for filling an intra-term vacancy in the vice presidency.\nAs a result, when such a vacancy occurred, the office was left vacant until filled through the next ensuing election and inauguration. Between 1812 and 1965, the vice presidency was vacant on sixteen occasions, as a result of seven deaths, one resignation, and eight cases of the vice president succeeding to the presidency. With the vacancy that followed the succession of Lyndon B. Johnson in 1963, the nation had been without a vice president for a cumulative total of 37 years.\nSection 2 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment provides that \"whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President, the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress.\" This procedure has been implemented twice since the amendment came into force: the first instance occurred in 1973 following the October 10 resignation of Spiro Agnew, when Gerald Ford was nominated by President Richard Nixon and confirmed by Congress. The second occurred ten months later on August 9, 1974, on Ford's accession to the presidency upon Nixon's resignation, when Nelson Rockefeller was nominated by President Ford and confirmed by Congress.\nHad it not been for this new constitutional mechanism, the vice presidency would have remained vacant after Agnew's resignation; the speaker of the House, Carl Albert, would have become Acting President had Nixon resigned in this scenario, under the terms of the Presidential Succession Act of 1947.\nOffice and status.\nSalary.\nThe vice president's salary in 2019 was $235,100. For 2024, the vice president's salary is $284,600, however, due to a pay freeze in effect since 2019, the actual portion of that salary that is payable remains $235,100. The salary was set by the 1989 Government Salary Reform Act, which also provides an automatic cost of living adjustment for federal employees. The vice president does not automatically receive a pension based on that office, but instead receives the same pension as other members of Congress based on their position as president of the Senate. The vice president must serve a minimum of two years to qualify for a pension.\nResidence.\nThe home of the vice president was designated in 1974, when Congress established Number One Observatory Circle as the official temporary residence of the vice president of the United States. In 1966, Congress, concerned about safety and security, and mindful of the increasing responsibilities of the office, allotted money ($75,000) to fund construction of a residence for the vice president, but implementation stalled. After eight years, the decision was revised, and One Observatory Circle was then designated for the vice president. Up until the change, vice presidents lived in homes, apartments, or hotels, and were compensated more like cabinet members and members of Congress, receiving only a housing allowance.\nThe three-story Queen Anne style mansion was built in 1893 on the grounds of the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C. to serve as residence for the superintendent of the Observatory. In 1923, the residence was reassigned to be the home of the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), which it was until it was turned over to the office of the vice president fifty years later.\nTravel and transportation.\nThe primary means of long-distance air travel for the vice president is one of two identical Boeing airplanes, which are extensively modified Boeing 757 airliners and are referred to as \"Air Force Two,\" while the vice president is on board. Any U.S. Air Force aircraft the vice president is aboard is referred to as \"Air Force Two\" for the duration of the flight. In-country trips are typically handled with just one of the two planes, while overseas trips are handled with both, one primary and one backup.\nFor short-distance air travel, the vice president has access to a fleet of U.S. Marine Corps helicopters of varying models including \"Marine Two\" when the vice president is aboard any particular one in the fleet. Flights are typically handled with as many as five helicopters all flying together and frequently swapping positions as to disguise which helicopter the vice president is actually aboard to any would-be threats.\nStaff.\nThe vice president is supported by personnel in the Office of the Vice President of the United States. The office was created in the Reorganization Act of 1939, which included an \"office of the Vice President\" under the Executive Office of the President. Salary for the staff is provided by both legislative and executive branch appropriations, in light of the vice president's roles in each branch.\nProtection.\nThe U.S. Secret Service is in charge with protecting the vice president and the second family. As part of their protection, vice presidents, second spouses, their children and other immediate family members, and other prominent persons and locations are assigned Secret Service codenames. The use of such names was originally due to security purposes and safety reasons.\nOffice spaces.\nIn the modern era, the vice president makes use of at least five different office spaces. These include an office in the West Wing, a ceremonial office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building near where most of the vice president's staff works, the Vice President's Room on the Senate side of the United States Capitol for meetings with members of Congress, an office in the Dirksen Senate Office Building, and an office at the vice president's residence.\nPost\u2013vice presidency.\nSince 1977, former presidents and former vice presidents who are elected or re-elected to the Senate are entitled to the largely honorific position of Deputy President pro tempore. To date, the only former vice president to have held this title is Hubert Humphrey. Also, under the terms of an 1886 Senate resolution, all former vice presidents are entitled to a portrait bust in the Senate wing of the United States Capitol, commemorating their service as presidents of the Senate. Dick Cheney is the most recently serving vice president in the collection.\nUnlike former presidents, whose pension is fixed at the same rate, regardless of their time in office, former vice presidents receive their retirement income based on their role as president of the Senate. Additionally, since 2008, each former vice president and their immediate family is entitled (under the Former Vice President Protection Act of 2008) to Secret Service protection for up to six months after leaving office, and again temporarily at any time thereafter if warranted.\nTimeline.\nGraphical timeline listing the vice presidents of the United States:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Vinegar typically contains from 4% to 18% acetic acid by volume.\nUsually, the acetic acid is produced by a double fermentation\u2014converting simple sugars to ethanol using yeast, and then converting ethanol to acetic acid using acetic acid bacteria. Many types of vinegar are made, depending on source materials.\nThe product is now mainly used in the culinary arts as a flavorful, acidic cooking ingredient, salad dressing, or pickling agent. Various types are used as condiments or garnishes, including balsamic vinegar and malt vinegar.\nAs an easily manufactured mild acid, it has a wide variety of industrial and domestic uses, including functioning as a household cleaner.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"vinegar\" arrived in Middle English from Old French (\"vyn egre\"; sour wine), which in turn derives from Latin: (wine) + (neuter gender of , sour). Vinegar was formerly also called eisel.\nThe word \"acetic\" derives from Latin (vinegar, or more properly \"vinum acetum\": \"wine turned sour\").\nHistory.\nWhile vinegar making may be as old as brewing, the first documented evidence of vinegar making and use was by the ancient Babylonians around 3000 BCE. They primarily made vinegar from fermentation of fruits, dates, figs, and beer and used it for both culinary and medicinal purposes. Its uses were then spread to neighboring lands, evident as traces of it also have been found in Egyptian urns.\nIn East Asia, the Chinese began professionalizing vinegar production in the Zhou dynasty. The book \"Zhou Li\" mentions that many noble or royal households had a \"vinegar maker\" as a specialized occupation. Most vinegar-making then was concentrated in what is now Shanxi province near the city of Taiyuan, which remains a famous vinegar-making region today. Many Chinese kinds of vinegar and their uses for culinary and medicinal purposes were written down in the agricultural manual \"Qimin Yaoshu\" (\u9f4a\u6c11\u8981\u8853).\nThe Greeks and Romans frequently used vinegar made from wine. The Spartans had vinegar as a part of their traditional blood soup \"melas zomos\"; in addition to flavoring the broth, the acidity of the vinegar prevented the blood from coagulating (a purpose for which vinegar is still used in modern blood soups around the world). The Roman Columella described the ingredients and process for making several types of vinegar in his work \"Res Rustica\".\nIn the late Middle Ages, vinegar making was slowly being professionalized in Europe, with the French city of Orl\u00e9ans becoming particularly famous for the quality of its vinegar through a formalized fermentation and aging process, which became known as the Orl\u00e9ans process. During this time, malt vinegar also began to develop in England, where it was first known as \"alegar\". Balsamic vinegar also began its evolution in the Duchy of Modena in Italy, though it would not become widely known until the Napoleonic Wars after being sold abroad by French troops.\nIn the 19th century, vinegar production underwent many dramatic changes, such as rapid industrialization and scientific analysis. Karl Sebastian Sch\u00fczenbach invented the first large-scale industrial process for vinegar production in the Kingdom of Baden in 1823. Known as the packed generator, it circulated alcohol over beechwood shavings to reduce fermentation times from several months down to 1\u20132 weeks. This process also facilitated the rise of vinegar made from pure alcohol called spirit vinegar or distilled white vinegar. Japan also began industrializing vinegar production during the last days of the Tokugawa shogunate, when Matazaemon Nakano, a man from a traditional sake brewing family, discovered that sake lees could be used to make rice vinegar. This helped provide ample vinegar for the burgeoning popularity of sushi in Japan. The company he founded, now known as Mizkan, is headquartered in Handa (near Nagoya) and is the largest vinegar producer in the world.\nMeanwhile, vinegar fermentation became understood as a natural and biological process. Louis Pasteur made the decisive discovery that a special type of bacteria, later known as acetic acid bacteria, was the agent of fermentation for vinegar production.\nIn the 20th century, vinegar production was again revolutionized by the invention of the submerged fermentation process that cut production times down to 1\u20132 days. This allowed the mass production of cheap vinegar around the world.\nChemistry.\nThe conversion of ethanol () and oxygen () to acetic acid () takes place by the following reaction:\nPolyphenols.\nVinegar contains numerous flavonoids, phenolic acids, and aldehydes, which vary in content depending on the source material used to make the vinegar, such as orange peel or various fruit juice concentrates.\nProduction.\nCommercial vinegar is produced either by a fast or a slow fermentation process. In general, slow methods are used in traditional vinegars, where fermentation proceeds over the course of a few months to a year. The longer fermentation period allows for the accumulation of a nontoxic slime composed of acetic acid bacteria and their cellulose biofilm, known as mother of vinegar.\nFast methods add the aforementioned mother of vinegar as a bacterial culture to the source liquid before adding air to oxygenate and promote the fastest fermentation. In fast production processes, vinegar may be produced in 1\u20133 days.\nVarieties.\nThe source materials for making vinegar are varied \u2013 different fruits, grains, alcoholic beverages, and other fermentable materials are used.\nFruit.\nFruit vinegars are made from fruit wines, usually without any additional flavoring. Common flavors of fruit vinegar include apple, blackcurrant, raspberry, quince, and tomato. Typically, the flavors of the original fruits remain in the final product. Most fruit vinegars are produced in Europe, where a market exists for high-priced vinegars made solely from specific fruits (as opposed to nonfruit vinegars that are infused with fruits or fruit flavors). Several varieties are produced in Asia. Persimmon vinegar, called \"gam sikcho\", is common in South Korea. Jujube vinegar, called \"zaocu\" or \"hongzaocu\", and wolfberry vinegar are produced in China. Apple cider vinegar is made from cider or apple must, and has a brownish-gold color. It is sometimes sold unfiltered and unpasteurized with the mother of vinegar present. It can be diluted with fruit juice or water or sweetened (usually with honey) for consumption.\nA byproduct of commercial kiwifruit growing is a large amount of waste in the form of misshapen or otherwise-rejected fruit (which may constitute up to 30% of the crop) and kiwifruit pomace. One of the uses for pomace is the production of kiwifruit vinegar, produced commercially in New Zealand since at least the early 1990s, and in China in 2008.\nVinegar made from raisins is used in cuisines of the Middle East. It is cloudy and medium brown in color, with a mild flavor. Vinegar made from dates is a traditional product of the Middle East, and used in Eastern Arabia.\nPalm.\nCoconut vinegar, made from fermented coconut sap or coconut water, is used extensively in Southeast Asian cuisine (notably the Philippines, where it is known as \"sukang tuba\"), as well as in some cuisines of India and Sri Lanka, especially Goan cuisine. A cloudy, white liquid, it has a particularly sharp, acidic taste with a slightly yeasty note.\nIn the Philippines, other types of vinegar are made from palm sap. Like coconut vinegar, they are by-products of \"tub\u00e2\" (palm wine) production. Two of the most widely produced are nipa palm vinegar (\"sukang nipa\" or \"sukang sasa\") and kaong palm vinegar (\"sukang kaong\" or \"sukang irok\"). Along with coconut and cane vinegar, they are the four main traditional vinegar types in the Philippines and are an important part of Filipino cuisine. Nipa palm vinegar is made from the sap of the leaf stalks of nipa palm. Its flavor has notes of citrus and imparts a distinctly musky aroma. Kaong palm vinegar is made from the sap of flower stalks of the kaong palm. It is sweeter than all the other Philippine vinegar types and is commonly used in salad dressing. Vinegar from the buri palm sap is also produced, but not with the same prevalence as coconut, nipa, and kaong vinegars. Kaong palm vinegar is also produced in Indonesia and Malaysia, though it is not as prevalent as in the Philippines because the palm wine industry is not as widespread in these Muslim-majority countries.\nBalsamic.\nBalsamic vinegar is an aromatic, aged vinegar produced in the Modena and Reggio Emilia provinces of Italy. The original product \u2014 traditional balsamic vinegar \u2014 is made from the concentrated juice, or must, of white Trebbiano grapes. It is dark brown, rich, sweet, and complex, with the finest grades being aged in successive casks made variously of oak, mulberry, chestnut, cherry, juniper, and ash wood. Originally a costly product available to only the Italian upper classes, traditional balsamic vinegar is marked \"tradizionale\" or \"DOC\" to denote its protected designation of origin status, and is aged for 12 to 25 years. A cheaper non-DOC commercial form described as \"aceto balsamico di Modena\" (balsamic vinegar of Modena) became widely known and available around the world in the late 20th century, typically made with concentrated grape juice mixed with a strong vinegar, then colored and slightly sweetened with caramel and sugar.\nBalsamic vinegar is made from a grape product. It contains no balsam, though was traditionally aged in balsam as one of the steps. A high acidity level is somewhat hidden by the sweetness of the other ingredients, making it mellow. In terms of its nutrition content, balsamic vinegar contains the carbohydrates of grape sugars (some 17% of total composition), making it some five times higher in caloric content than typical distilled or wine vinegar.\nCane.\nVinegar made from sugarcane juice is traditional to and is most popular in the Philippines, in particular in the northern Ilocos Region (where it is called \"sukang Iloko\" or \"sukang basi\"). It ranges from dark yellow to golden brown in color, and has a mellow flavor, similar in some respects to rice vinegar, though with a somewhat \"fresher\" taste. Because it contains no residual sugar, it is no sweeter than any other vinegar. In the Philippines, it often is labeled as \"sukang maasim\" (Tagalog for \"sour vinegar\").\nCane vinegars from Ilocos are made in two different ways. One way is to simply place sugar cane juice in large jars; it becomes sour by the direct action of bacteria on the sugar. The other way is through fermentation to produce a traditional wine known as \"basi\". Low-quality \"basi\" is then allowed to undergo acetic acid fermentation that converts alcohol into acetic acid. Contaminated \"basi\" also becomes vinegar.\nCane vinegar is also produced in other countries, like France and the United States. A white variation has become quite popular in Brazil in recent years, where it is the cheapest type of vinegar sold. It is now common for other types of vinegar (made from wine, rice, and apple cider) to be sold mixed with cane vinegar to lower the cost.\nSugarcane \"sirka\" is made from sugarcane juice in parts of northern India. During summer, people put cane juice in earthenware pots with iron nails. The fermentation takes place due to the action of wild yeast. The cane juice is converted to vinegar having a blackish color (from ferrous oxide and acetate). The \"sirka\" is used to preserve pickles and for flavoring curries.\nGrains.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Malt vinegar made from ale, also called \"alegar\", is made by malting barley, causing the starch in the grain to turn to maltose. Then an ale is brewed from the maltose and allowed to turn into vinegar, which is then aged. It is typically light-brown in color. Malt vinegar (along with salt) is a traditional seasoning for fish and chips, and in the United Kingdom and Canada, a popular seasoning for French fries in general. Some fish and chip shops replace it with non-brewed condiment. Salt and vinegar are combined as a common, traditional flavoring for crisps; in some varieties this involves the conversion of the vinegar to sodium acetate or sodium diacetate, to avoid dampening the product in manufacture.\nChinese black vinegar is an aged product made from rice, wheat, millet, sorghum, or a combination of these. It has an inky black color and a complex, malty flavour. The recipe is not fixed, so some Chinese black vinegars may contain added sugar, spices, or caramel color. The most popular variety, Zhenjiang vinegar, originates in the city of Zhenjiang in Jiangsu Province, eastern China. Shanxi mature vinegar is another popular type of Chinese vinegar that is made exclusively from sorghum and other grains. Nowadays in Shanxi province, some traditional vinegar workshops still produce handmade vinegar with a high acidity that is aged for at least five years. Only the vinegars made in Taiyuan and some counties in Jinzhong and aged for at least three years are considered authentic Shanxi mature vinegar according to the latest national standard. A somewhat lighter form of black vinegar, made from rice, is produced in Japan, where it is called \"kurozu\".\nRice vinegar is most popular in the cuisines of East and Southeast Asia. It is available in \"white\" (light yellow), red, and black varieties. The Japanese prefer a light rice vinegar for the preparation of sushi rice and salad dressings. Red rice vinegar traditionally is colored with red yeast rice. Black rice vinegar (made with black glutinous rice) is most popular in China, and it is also widely used in other East Asian countries. White rice vinegar has a mild acidity with a somewhat \"flat\" and uncomplex flavor. Some varieties of rice vinegar are sweetened or otherwise seasoned with spices or other added flavorings.\nSpirits.\nThe term \"spirit vinegar\" is sometimes reserved for the stronger variety (5% to 24% acetic acid) made from sugar cane or chemically produced acetic acid. To be called \"spirit vinegar\", the product must come from an agricultural source and must be made by \"double fermentation\". The first fermentation is sugar to alcohol, and the second is alcohol to acetic acid. Products made from synthetically produced acetic acid cannot be called \"vinegar\" in the UK, where the term allowed is \"non-brewed condiment\".\nSherry vinegar is linked to the production of sherry wines of Jerez. Dark mahogany in color, it is made exclusively from the acetic fermentation of wines. It is concentrated and has generous aromas, including a note of wood, ideal for vinaigrettes and flavoring various foods. Wine vinegar is made from red or white wine, and is the most commonly used vinegar in Southern and Central Europe, Cyprus, and Israel. As with wine, the range in quality is considerable. Better-quality wine vinegars are matured in wood for up to two years, and exhibit a complex, mellow flavor. Wine vinegar tends to have a lower acidity than white or cider vinegar. More expensive wine vinegars are made from individual varieties of wine, such as champagne, sherry, or pinot gris.\nThe term \"distilled vinegar\" as used in the United States (called \"spirit vinegar\" in the UK, \"white vinegar\" in Canada) is something of a misnomer because it is not produced by distillation, but by fermentation of distilled alcohol. The fermentate is diluted to produce a colorless solution of 5 to 8% acetic acid in water, with a pH of about 2.6. This is variously known as distilled spirit, \"virgin\" vinegar, or white vinegar, and is used in cooking, baking, meat preservation, and pickling, as well as for medicinal, laboratory, and cleaning purposes. The most common starting material in some regions, because of its low cost, is barley malt, or in the United States, corn. It is sometimes derived from petroleum. Distilled vinegar is used predominantly for cooking, although in the UK it is used as an alternative to brown or light malt vinegar. White distilled vinegar can also be used for cleaning, and some types are sold specifically for this purpose.\nCulinary uses.\nVinegar is commonly used in food preparation, in particular as pickling liquids, vinaigrettes, and other salad dressings. It is an ingredient in sauces, such as hot sauce, mustard, ketchup, and mayonnaise. Vinegar is sometimes used in chutneys. It is often used as a condiment on its own, or as a part of other condiments. Marinades often contain vinegar. Soups sometimes have vinegar added to them, as is the case with hot and sour soup. In terms of its shelf life, vinegar's acidic nature allows it to last indefinitely without the use of refrigeration; it is essentially already \"spoiled\".\nBeverages.\nSeveral beverages are made using vinegar, for instance \"posca\" in ancient Rome. The ancient Greek drink \"oxymel\" is made from vinegar and honey, and \"sekanjabin\" is a traditional Persian drink similar to \"oxymel\". Other preparations, known colloquially as \"shrubs\", range from simply mixing sugar water or honey water with small amounts of fruity vinegar, to making syrup by laying fruit or mint in vinegar for several days, then sieving off solid parts and adding considerable amounts of sugar. Some prefer to boil the \"shrub\" as a final step. These recipes have lost much of their popularity with the rise of carbonated beverages, such as soft drinks.\nDiet and metabolism.\nPreliminary research indicates that consuming 2\u20134 tablespoons of vinegar may cause small reductions in postprandial levels of blood glucose and insulin in people with diabetes.\nNutrition.\nDistilled or red wine vinegar is 95% water, with no fat or protein. In a reference amount, distilled vinegar supplies of food energy and no micronutrients in significant content. The composition (and absence of nutrient content) for red wine vinegar and apple cider vinegar are the same, whereas balsamic vinegar is 77% water with 17% carbohydrates, per 100\u00a0mL, and contains no fat, protein, or micronutrients.\nNon-culinary uses.\nFolk medicine.\nSince antiquity, folk medicine treatments have used vinegar, but no conclusive evidence from clinical research supports health claims of benefits for diabetes, weight loss, cancer, or use as a probiotic. A systematic review and meta-analysis later suggested it could help type 2 diabetics reduce insulin and glucose after meals. \nApplying vinegar to common jellyfish stings deactivates the nematocysts, although not as effectively as hot water. This also applies to the Portuguese man o' war, which, although generally considered to be a jellyfish, is not (it is a siphonophore).\nSome treatments with vinegar pose risks to health. Esophageal injury by apple cider vinegar has been reported, and because vinegar products sold for medicinal purposes are neither regulated nor standardized, such products may vary widely in content and acidity.\nCleaning.\nWhite vinegar is often used as a household cleaning agent. For most uses, dilution with water is recommended for safety and to avoid damaging the surfaces being cleaned. Because it is acidic, it can dissolve mineral deposits from glass, coffee makers, and other smooth surfaces. Vinegar is known as an effective cleaner of stainless steel and glass. Malt vinegar sprinkled onto crumpled newspaper is a traditional, and still-popular, method of cleaning grease-smeared windows and mirrors in the United Kingdom.\nVinegar can be used for polishing copper, brass, bronze or silver. It is an excellent solvent for cleaning epoxy resin as well as the gum on sticker-type price tags. It has been reported as an effective drain cleaner.\nThe use of vinegar in dishwashers and washing machines can cause damage to their rubber seals and hoses, leading to leaks. According to testing done by Consumer Reports, vinegar is ineffective as a rinse aid and in removing hard-water film while used in a dishwasher. According to Brian Sansoni, chief spokesperson for the American Cleaning Institute, vinegar \"isn't very useful with stains that have already set into clothing, including food stains and bloodstains.\" \nOther household items and surfaces that can be damaged by vinegar include flooring, stone countertops, knives, the screens of electronic devices, clothes, iron water tanks, and rubber components of various small appliances. Common metals that can be damaged by vinegar include aluminum, copper, and lower-quality grades of stainless steel often used in small appliances.\nHerbicide.\nVinegar can be used as a contact herbicide and is more effective at higher concentrations. Twenty percent acetic acid is commonly sold for this purpose. Acetic acid is non-selective and does not translocate so it must be applied to the base of the plant in order to kill the root system and avoid killing surrounding plants unintentionally. Vinegar does not provide residual plant suppression and must be reapplied as new plants germinate\nReactions, byproducts and contaminants.\nSolutions above 10% require careful handling, as they are corrosive and damaging to the skin.\nWhen a bottle of vinegar is opened, mother of vinegar may develop. It is considered harmless and can be removed by filtering. \nWhen baking soda and vinegar are combined, the bicarbonate ion of the baking soda reacts with acetic acid to form carbonic acid, which decomposes into carbon dioxide and water, completing the carbon cycle. Sodium acetate remains in solution with the water contained in the vinegar.\nRegulation.\nSome countries have regulations on the permitted acidity percentage of vinegar. For example, the government of Canada limits acetic to between 4.1% and 12.3%, unless the vinegar is sold only for manufacturing use and identified as such. In the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, vinegar must contain a minimum of 4% acetic acid by volume.\nMany jurisdictions distinguish between brewed vinegar and preparations made with diluted acetic acid. The latter may not be sold as \"vinegar\" and is instead referred to as \"non-brewed condiment\" in the UK, or \"imitation vinegar\" in Australia and New Zealand.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He emphasized the importance of scientific research to national security and economic well-being, and was chiefly responsible for the movement that led to the creation of the National Science Foundation.\nBush joined the Department of Electrical Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1919, and founded the company that became Raytheon in 1922. Bush became vice president of MIT and dean of the MIT School of Engineering in 1932, and president of the Carnegie Institution of Washington in 1938.\nDuring his career, Bush patented a string of his own inventions. He is known particularly for his engineering work on analog computers, and for the memex. Starting in 1927, Bush constructed a differential analyzer, a mechanical analog computer with some digital components that could solve differential equations with as many as 18\u00a0independent variables. An offshoot of the work at MIT by Bush and others was the beginning of digital circuit design theory. The memex, which he began developing in the 1930s (heavily influenced by Emanuel Goldberg's \"Statistical Machine\" from 1928) was a hypothetical adjustable microfilm viewer with a structure analogous to that of hypertext. The memex and Bush's 1945 essay \"As We May Think\" influenced generations of computer scientists, who drew inspiration from his vision of the future.\nBush was appointed to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) in 1938, and soon became its chairman. As chairman of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), and later director of OSRD, Bush coordinated the activities of some six thousand leading American scientists in the application of science to warfare. Bush was a well-known policymaker and public intellectual during World War\u00a0II, when he was in effect the first presidential science advisor. As head of NDRC and OSRD, he initiated the Manhattan Project, and ensured that it received top priority from the highest levels of government. In \"Science, The Endless Frontier\", his 1945 report to the president of the United States, Bush called for an expansion of government support for science, and he pressed for the creation of the National Science Foundation.\nEarly life and education.\nVannevar Bush was born in Everett, Massachusetts, on March 11, 1890. He was the third child and only son of Richard Perry Bush, the local Universalist pastor, and his wife Emma Linwood (n\u00e9e Paine), the daughter of a prominent Provincetown family. He had two older sisters, Edith and Reba. He was named after John Vannevar, an old friend of the family who had attended Tufts College with Perry. The family moved to Chelsea, Massachusetts, in 1892, and Bush graduated from Chelsea High School in 1909.\nBush graduated from Tufts College, like his father before him. A popular student, he was vice president of his sophomore class, and president of his junior class. During his senior year, he managed the football team. He became a member of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity, and dated Phoebe Clara Davis, who also came from Chelsea. Tufts allowed students to gain a master's degree in four years simultaneously with a bachelor's degree. For his master's thesis, Bush invented and patented a \"profile tracer\". This was a mapping device for assisting surveyors that looked like a lawn mower. It had two bicycle wheels, and a pen that plotted the terrain over which it traveled. It was the first of a string of inventions. On graduation in 1913 he received both Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees.\nAfter graduation, Bush worked at General Electric (GE) in Schenectady, New York, for $14 a week. As a \"test man,\" he assessed equipment to ensure that it was safe. He transferred to GE's plant in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, to work on high voltage transformers, but after a fire broke out at the plant, Bush and the other test men were suspended. He returned to Tufts in October 1914 to teach mathematics, and spent the 1915 summer break working at the Brooklyn Navy Yard as an electrical inspector.\nBush was awarded a $1,500\u00a0scholarship to study at Clark University as a doctoral student of Arthur Gordon Webster, but Webster wanted Bush to study acoustics, a popular field at the time. Bush preferred to quit rather than study a subject that did not interest him.\nBush subsequently enrolled in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) electrical engineering program. Spurred by the need for enough financial security to marry, he submitted his thesis, entitled \"Oscillating-Current Circuits: An Extension of the Theory of Generalized Angular Velocities, with Applications to the Coupled Circuit and the Artificial Transmission Line\", in April 1916. His adviser, Arthur Edwin Kennelly, demanded more work from him, but Bush refused, and Kennelly was overruled by the department chairman. Bush received his doctorate in engineering jointly from MIT and Harvard University. He married Phoebe in August 1916. They had two sons: Richard Davis Bush and John Hathaway Bush.\nEarly engineering activities.\nBush accepted a job with Tufts, where he became involved with the American Radio and Research Corporation (AMRAD), which began broadcasting music from the campus on March 8, 1916. The station owner, Harold Power, hired him to run the company's laboratory, at a salary greater than that which Bush drew from Tufts. In 1917, following the United States' entry into World War I, he went to work with the National Research Council. He attempted to develop a means of detecting submarines by measuring the disturbance in the Earth's magnetic field. His device worked as designed, but only from a wooden ship; attempts to get it to work on a metal ship such as a destroyer failed.\nBush left Tufts in 1919, although he remained employed by AMRAD, and joined the Department of Electrical Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he worked under Dugald C. Jackson. In 1922, he collaborated with fellow MIT professor William H. Timbie on \"Principles of Electrical Engineering\", an introductory textbook. AMRAD's lucrative contracts from World War\u00a0I had been cancelled, and Bush attempted to reverse the company's fortunes by developing a thermostatic switch invented by Al Spencer, an AMRAD technician, on his own time. AMRAD's management was not interested in the device, but had no objection to its sale. Bush found backing from Laurence K. Marshall and Richard S. Aldrich to create the Spencer Thermostat Company, which hired Bush as a consultant. The new company soon had revenues in excess of a million dollars. It merged with General Plate Company to form Metals &amp; Controls Corporation in 1931, and with Texas Instruments in 1959. Texas Instruments sold it to Bain Capital in 2006, and it became a separate company again as Sensata Technologies in 2010.\nIn 1924, Bush and Marshall teamed up with physicist Charles G. Smith, who had invented a voltage-regulator tube called the S-tube. The device enabled radios, which had previously required two different types of batteries, to operate from mains power. Marshall had raised $25,000 to set up the American Appliance Company on July 7, 1922, to build silent refrigerators, with Bush and Smith among its five directors, but changed course and renamed it the Raytheon Company, to make and market the S-tube. The venture made Bush wealthy, and Raytheon ultimately became a large electronics company and defense contractor.\nStarting in 1927, Bush constructed a differential analyzer, an analog computer that could solve differential equations with as many as 18 independent variables. This invention arose from previous work performed by Herbert R. Stewart, one of Bush's master's students, who at Bush's suggestion created the integraph, a device for solving first-order differential equations, in 1925. Another student, Harold Hazen, proposed extending the device to handle second-order differential equations. Bush immediately realized the potential of such an invention, for these were much more difficult to solve, but also quite common in physics. Under Bush's supervision, Hazen was able to construct the differential analyzer, a table-like array of shafts and pens that mechanically simulated and plotted the desired equation. Unlike earlier designs that were purely mechanical, the differential analyzer had both electrical and mechanical components. Among the engineers who made use of the differential analyzer was General Electric's Edith Clarke, who used it to solve problems relating to electric power transmission. For developing the differential analyzer, Bush was awarded the Franklin Institute's Louis E. Levy Medal in 1928.\nBush taught Boolean algebra, circuit theory, and operational calculus according to the methods of Oliver Heaviside while Samuel Wesley Stratton was President of MIT. When Harold Jeffreys in Cambridge, England, offered his mathematical treatment in \"Operational Methods in Mathematical Physics\" (1927), Bush responded with his seminal textbook \"Operational Circuit Analysis\" (1929) for instructing electrical engineering students. In the preface he wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I write as an engineer and do not pretend to be a mathematician. I lean for support, and expect always to lean, upon the mathematician, just as I must lean upon the chemist, the physician, or the lawyer. Norbert Wiener has patiently guided me around many a mathematical pitfall ... he has written an appendix to this text on certain mathematical points. I did not know an engineer and a mathematician could have such good times together. I only wish that I could get the real vital grasp of mathematics that he has of the basic principles of physics. Parry Moon and Stratton were acknowledged, as was M.S. Vallarta who \"wrote the first set of class notes which I used.\"\nAn offshoot of the work at MIT was the beginning of digital circuit design theory by one of Bush's graduate students, Claude Shannon. Working on the analytical engine, Shannon described the application of Boolean algebra to electronic circuits in his landmark master's thesis, \"A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits\". In 1935, Bush was approached by OP-20-G, which was searching for an electronic device to aid in codebreaking. Bush was paid a $10,000 fee to design the Rapid Analytical Machine (RAM). The project went over budget and was not delivered until 1938, when it was found to be unreliable in service. Nonetheless, it was an important step toward creating such a device.\nThe reform of MIT's administration began in 1930, with the appointment of Karl T. Compton as president. Bush and Compton soon clashed over the issue of limiting the amount of outside consultancy by professors, a battle Bush quickly lost, but the two men soon built a solid professional relationship. Compton appointed Bush to the newly created post of vice president in 1932. That year Bush also became the dean of the MIT School of Engineering. The two positions came with a salary of $12,000 plus $6,000 for expenses per annum.\nThe companies Bush helped to found and the technologies he brought to the market made him financially secure, so he was able to pursue academic and scientific studies that he felt made the world better in the years before and after World War II.\nWorld War II.\nCarnegie Institution for Science.\nIn May 1938, Bush accepted a prestigious appointment as president of the Carnegie Institution of Washington (CIW), which had been founded in Washington, D.C. Also known as the Carnegie Institution for Science, it had an endowment of $33\u00a0million, and annually spent $1.5\u00a0million in research, most of which was carried out at its eight major laboratories. Bush became its president on January 1, 1939, with a salary of $25,000. He was then able to influence research policy in the United States at the highest level, and could informally advise the government on scientific matters. Bush soon discovered that the CIW had serious financial problems, and he had to ask the Carnegie Corporation for additional funding.\nBush clashed over leadership of the institute with Cameron Forbes, CIW's board chairman, and with his predecessor, John Merriam, who continued to offer unwanted advice. A major embarrassment to them all was Harry H. Laughlin, the head of the Eugenics Record Office, whose activities Merriam had attempted to curtail without success. Bush made it a priority to remove him, regarding him as a scientific fraud, and one of his first acts was to ask for a review of Laughlin's work. In June 1938, Bush asked Laughlin to retire, offering him an annuity, which Laughlin reluctantly accepted. The Eugenics Record Office was renamed the Genetics Record Office, its funding was drastically cut, and it was closed completely in 1944. Senator Robert Reynolds attempted to get Laughlin reinstated, but Bush informed the trustees that an inquiry into Laughlin would \"show him to be physically incapable of directing an office, and an investigation of his scientific standing would be equally conclusive.\"\nBush wanted the institute to concentrate on hard science. He gutted Carnegie's archeology program, setting the field back many years in the United States. He saw little value in the humanities and social sciences, and slashed funding for \"Isis\", a journal dedicated to the history of science and technology and its cultural influence. Bush later explained that \"I have a great reservation about these studies where somebody goes out and interviews a bunch of people and reads a lot of stuff and writes a book and puts it on a shelf and nobody ever reads it.\"\nNational Advisory Committee for Aeronautics.\nOn August 23, 1938, Bush was appointed to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), the predecessor of NASA. Its chairman Joseph Sweetman Ames became ill, and Bush, as vice chairman, soon had to act in his place. In December 1938, NACA asked for $11\u00a0million to establish a new aeronautical research laboratory in Sunnyvale, California, to supplement the existing Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory. The California location was chosen for its proximity to some of the largest aviation corporations. This decision was supported by the chief of the United States Army Air Corps, Major General Henry H. Arnold, and by the head of the navy's Bureau of Aeronautics, Rear Admiral Arthur B. Cook, who between them were planning to spend $225\u00a0million on new aircraft in the year ahead. However, Congress was not convinced of its value, and Bush had to appear before the Senate Appropriations Committee on April 5, 1939. It was a frustrating experience for Bush, since he had never appeared before Congress before, and the senators were not swayed by his arguments. Further lobbying was required before funding for the new center, known as the Ames Research Center, was finally approved. By this time, war had broken out in Europe, and the inferiority of American aircraft engines was apparent, in particular the Allison V-1710 which performed poorly at high altitudes and had to be removed from the P-51 Mustang in favor of the British Rolls-Royce Merlin engine. The NACA asked for funding to build a third center in Ohio, which became the Glenn Research Center. Following Ames's retirement in October 1939, Bush became chairman of the NACA, with George J. Mead as his deputy. Bush remained a member of the NACA until November 1948.\nNational Defense Research Committee.\nDuring World War\u00a0I, Bush had become aware of poor cooperation between civilian scientists and the military. Concerned about the lack of coordination in scientific research and the requirements of defense mobilization, Bush proposed the creation of a general directive agency in the federal government, which he discussed with his colleagues. He had the secretary of NACA prepare a draft of the proposed National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) to be presented to Congress, but after the Germans invaded France in May 1940, Bush decided speed was important and approached President Franklin D. Roosevelt directly. Through the President's uncle, Frederic Delano, Bush managed to set up a meeting with Roosevelt on June 12, 1940, to which he brought a single sheet of paper describing the agency. Roosevelt approved the proposal in 15\u00a0minutes, writing \"OK\u00a0\u2013 FDR\" on the sheet.\nWith Bush as chairman, the NDRC was functioning even before the agency was officially established by order of the Council of National Defense on June 27, 1940. The organization operated financially on a hand-to-mouth basis with monetary support from the president's emergency fund. Bush appointed four leading scientists to the NDRC: Karl Taylor Compton (president of MIT), James B. Conant (president of Harvard University), Frank B. Jewett (president of the National Academy of Sciences and chairman of the Board of Directors of Bell Laboratories), and Richard C. Tolman (dean of the graduate school at Caltech); Rear Admiral Harold G. Bowen, Sr. and Brigadier General George V. Strong represented the military. The civilians already knew each other well, which allowed the organization to begin functioning immediately. The NDRC established itself in the administration building at the Carnegie Institution of Washington. Each member of the committee was assigned an area of responsibility, while Bush handled coordination. A small number of projects reported to him directly, such as the S-1 Section. Compton's deputy, Alfred Loomis, said that \"of the men whose death in the Summer of 1940 would have been the greatest calamity for America, the President is first, and Dr.\u00a0Bush would be second or third.\"\nBush was fond of saying that \"if he made any important contribution to the war effort at all, it would be to get the Army and Navy to tell each other what they were doing.\" He established a cordial relationship with Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, and Stimson's assistant, Harvey H. Bundy, who found Bush \"impatient\" and \"vain\", but said he was \"one of the most important, able men I ever knew\". Bush's relationship with the navy was more turbulent. Bowen, the director of the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), saw the NDRC as a bureaucratic rival, and recommended abolishing it. A series of bureaucratic battles ended with the NRL placed under the Bureau of Ships, and Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox placing an unsatisfactory fitness report in Bowen's personnel file. After the war, Bowen would again try to create a rival to the NDRC inside the navy.\nOn August 31, 1940, Bush met with Henry Tizard, and arranged a series of meetings between the NDRC and the Tizard Mission, a British scientific delegation. At a meeting On September 19, 1940, the Americans described Loomis and Compton's microwave research. They had an experimental 10\u00a0cm wavelength short wave radar, but admitted that it did not have enough power and that they were at a dead end. Taffy Bowen and John Cockcroft of the Tizard Mission then produced a cavity magnetron, a device more advanced than anything the Americans had seen, with a power output of around 10\u00a0kW at 10\u00a0cm, enough to spot the periscope of a surfaced submarine at night from an aircraft. To exploit the invention, Bush decided to create a special laboratory. The NDRC allocated the new laboratory a budget of $455,000 for its first year. Loomis suggested that the lab should be run by the Carnegie Institution, but Bush convinced him that it would best be run by MIT. The Radiation Laboratory, as it came to be known, tested its airborne radar from an Army B-18 on March 27, 1941. By mid-1941, it had developed SCR-584 radar, a mobile radar fire control system for antiaircraft guns.\nIn September 1940, Norbert Wiener approached Bush with a proposal to build a digital computer. Bush declined to provide NDRC funding for it on the grounds that he did not believe that it could be completed before the end of the war. The supporters of digital computers were disappointed at the decision, which they attributed to a preference for outmoded analog technology. In June 1943, the Army provided $500,000 to build the computer, which became ENIAC, the first general-purpose electronic computer. Having delayed its funding, Bush's prediction proved correct as ENIAC was not completed until December 1945, after the war had ended. His critics saw his attitude as a failure of vision.\nOffice of Scientific Research and Development.\nOn June 28, 1941, Roosevelt established the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) with the signing of Executive Order\u00a08807. Bush became director of the OSRD while Conant succeeded him as chairman of the NDRC, which was subsumed into the OSRD. The OSRD was on a firmer financial footing than the NDRC since it received funding from Congress, and had the resources and the authority to develop weapons and technologies with or without the military. Furthermore, the OSRD had a broader mandate than the NDRC, moving into additional areas such as medical research and the mass production of penicillin and sulfa drugs. The organization grew to 850\u00a0full-time employees, and produced between 30,000 and 35,000 reports. The OSRD was involved in some 2,500 contracts, worth in excess of $536 million.\nBush's method of management at the OSRD was to direct overall policy, while delegating supervision of divisions to qualified colleagues and letting them do their jobs without interference. He attempted to interpret the mandate of the OSRD as narrowly as possible to avoid overtaxing his office and to prevent duplicating the efforts of other agencies. Bush would often ask: \"Will it help to win a war; \"this\" war?\" Other challenges involved obtaining adequate funds from the president and Congress and determining apportionment of research among government, academic, and industrial facilities. His most difficult problems, and also greatest successes, were keeping the confidence of the military, which distrusted the ability of civilians to observe security regulations and devise practical solutions, and opposing conscription of young scientists into the armed forces. This became especially difficult as the army's manpower crisis really began to bite in 1944. In all, the OSRD requested deferments for some 9,725\u00a0employees of OSRD contractors, of which all but 63 were granted. In his obituary, \"The New York Times\" described Bush as \"a master craftsman at steering around obstacles, whether they were technical or political or bull-headed generals and admirals.\"\nProximity fuze.\nIn August 1940, the NDRC began work on a proximity fuze, a fuze inside an artillery shell that would explode when it came close to its target. A radar set, along with the batteries to power it, was miniaturized to fit inside a shell, and its glass vacuum tubes designed to withstand the 20,000\u00a0g-force of being fired from a gun and 500 rotations per second in flight. Unlike normal radar, the proximity fuze sent out a continuous signal rather than short pulses. The NDRC created a special Section\u00a0T chaired by Merle Tuve of the CIW, with Commander William S. Parsons as special assistant to Bush and liaison between the NDRC and the Navy's Bureau of Ordnance (BuOrd). One of CIW staff members that Tuve recruited to Section\u00a0T in 1940 was James Van Allen. In April 1942, Bush placed Section\u00a0T directly under the OSRD, and Parsons in charge. The research effort remained under Tuve but moved to the Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), where Parsons was BuOrd's representative. In August 1942, a live firing test was conducted with the newly commissioned cruiser ; three pilotless drones were shot down in succession.\nTo preserve the secret of the proximity fuze, its use was initially permitted only over water, where a dud round could not fall into enemy hands. In late 1943, the Army obtained permission to use the weapon over land. The proximity fuze proved particularly effective against the V-1 flying bomb over England, and later Antwerp, in 1944. A version was also developed for use with howitzers against ground targets. Bush met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff in October 1944 to press for its use, arguing that the Germans would be unable to copy and produce it before the war was over. Eventually, the Joint Chiefs agreed to allow its employment from December 25. In response to the German Ardennes Offensive on December 16, 1944, the immediate use of the proximity fuze was authorized, and it went into action with deadly effect. By the end of 1944, proximity fuzes were coming off the production lines at the rate of 40,000\u00a0per day. \"If one looks at the proximity fuze program as a whole,\" historian James Phinney Baxter III wrote, \"the magnitude and complexity of the effort rank it among the three or four most extraordinary scientific achievements of the war.\"\nThe German V-1 flying bomb demonstrated a serious omission in OSRD's portfolio: guided missiles. While the OSRD had some success developing unguided rockets, it had nothing comparable to the V-1, the V-2 or the Henschel Hs 293 air-to-ship gliding guided bomb. Although the United States trailed the Germans and Japanese in several areas, this represented an entire field that had been left to the enemy. Bush did not seek the advice of Robert H. Goddard. Goddard would come to be regarded as America's pioneer of rocketry, but many contemporaries regarded him as a crank. Before the war, Bush had gone on the record as saying, \"I don't understand how a serious scientist or engineer can play around with rockets\", but in May 1944, he was forced to travel to London to warn General Dwight Eisenhower of the danger posed by the V-1 and V-2. Bush could only recommend that the launch sites be bombed, which was done.\nManhattan Project.\nBush played a critical role in persuading the United States government to undertake a crash program to create an atomic bomb. When the NDRC was formed, the Committee on Uranium was placed under it, reporting directly to Bush as the Uranium Committee. Bush reorganized the committee, strengthening its scientific component by adding Tuve, George B. Pegram, Jesse W. Beams, Ross Gunn and Harold Urey. When the OSRD was formed in June 1941, the Uranium Committee was again placed directly under Bush. For security reasons, its name was changed to the Section\u00a0S-1.\nBush met with Roosevelt and Vice President Henry A. Wallace on October 9, 1941, to discuss the project. He briefed Roosevelt on Tube Alloys, the British atomic bomb project and its Maud Committee, which had concluded that an atomic bomb was feasible, and on the German nuclear energy project, about which little was known. Roosevelt approved and expedited the atomic program. To control it, he created a Top Policy Group consisting of himself\u2014although he never attended a meeting\u2014Wallace, Bush, Conant, Stimson and the Chief of Staff of the Army, General George Marshall. On Bush's advice, Roosevelt chose the army to run the project rather than the navy, although the navy had shown far more interest in the field, and was already conducting research into atomic energy for powering ships. Bush's negative experiences with the Navy had convinced him that it would not listen to his advice, and could not handle large-scale construction projects.\nIn March 1942, Bush sent a report to Roosevelt outlining work by Robert Oppenheimer on the nuclear cross section of uranium-235. Oppenheimer's calculations, which Bush had George Kistiakowsky check, estimated that the critical mass of a sphere of Uranium-235 was in the range of 2.5 to 5\u00a0kilograms, with a destructive power of around 2,000\u00a0tons of TNT. Moreover, it appeared that plutonium might be even more fissile. After conferring with Brigadier General Lucius D. Clay about the construction requirements, Bush drew up a submission for $85\u00a0million in fiscal year 1943 for four pilot plants, which he forwarded to Roosevelt on June 17, 1942. With the Army on board, Bush moved to streamline oversight of the project by the OSRD, replacing the Section\u00a0S-1 with a new S-1 Executive Committee.\nA week later, on June 23, President Roosevelt sent this one-sentence memo back to Bush: \"Do you have the money?\"\nBush soon became dissatisfied with the dilatory way the project was run, with its indecisiveness over the selection of sites for the pilot plants. He was particularly disturbed at the allocation of an AA-3 priority, which would delay completion of the pilot plants by three months. Bush complained about these problems to Bundy and Under Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson. Major General Brehon B. Somervell, the commander of the army's Services of Supply, appointed Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves as project director in September. Within days of taking over, Groves approved the proposed site at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and obtained a AAA priority. At a meeting in Stimson's office on September 23 attended by Bundy, Bush, Conant, Groves, Marshall Somervell and Stimson, Bush put forward his proposal for steering the project by a small committee answerable to the Top Policy Group. The meeting agreed with Bush, and created a Military Policy Committee chaired by him, with Somervell's chief of staff, Brigadier General Wilhelm D. Styer, representing the army, and Rear Admiral William R. Purnell representing the navy.\nAt the meeting with Roosevelt on October 9, 1941, Bush advocated cooperating with the United Kingdom, and he began corresponding with his British counterpart, Sir\u00a0John Anderson. But by October 1942, Conant and Bush agreed that a joint project would pose security risks and be more complicated to manage. Roosevelt approved a Military Policy Committee recommendation stating that information given to the British should be limited to technologies that they were actively working on and should not extend to post-war developments. In July 1943, on a visit to London to learn about British progress on antisubmarine technology, Bush, Stimson, and Bundy met with Anderson, Lord Cherwell, and Winston Churchill at 10 Downing Street. At the meeting, Churchill forcefully pressed for a renewal of interchange, while Bush defended existing policy. Only when he returned to Washington did he discover that Roosevelt had agreed with the British. The Quebec Agreement merged the two atomic bomb projects, creating the Combined Policy Committee with Stimson, Bush and Conant as United States representatives.\nBush appeared on the cover of \"Time\" magazine on April 3, 1944. He toured the Western Front in October 1944, and spoke to ordnance officers, but no senior commander would meet with him. He was able to meet with Samuel Goudsmit and other members of the Alsos Mission, who assured him that there was no danger from the German project; he conveyed this assessment to Lieutenant General Bedell Smith. In May 1945, Bush became part of the Interim Committee formed to advise the new president, Harry S. Truman, on nuclear weapons. It advised that the atomic bomb should be used against an industrial target in Japan as soon as possible and without warning. Bush was present at the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range on July 16, 1945, for the Trinity nuclear test, the first detonation of an atomic bomb. Afterwards, he took his hat off to Oppenheimer in tribute.\nBefore the end of the Second World War, Bush and Conant had foreseen and sought to avoid a possible nuclear arms race. Bush proposed international scientific openness and information sharing as a method of self-regulation for the scientific community, to prevent any one political group gaining a scientific advantage. Before nuclear research became public knowledge, Bush used the development of biological weapons as a model for the discussion of similar issues, an \"opening wedge\". He was less successful in promoting his ideas in peacetime with President Harry Truman, than he had been under wartime conditions with Roosevelt.\nIn \"As We May Think\", an essay published by the \"Atlantic Monthly\" in July 1945, Bush wrote: \"This has not been a scientist's war; it has been a war in which all have had a part. The scientists, burying their old professional competition in the demand of a common cause, have shared greatly and learned much. It has been exhilarating to work in effective partnership.\"\nPost-war years.\nMemex concept.\nBush introduced the concept of the memex during the 1930s, which he imagined as a form of memory augmentation involving a microfilm-based \"device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.\" He wanted the memex to emulate the way the brain links data by association rather than by indexes and traditional, hierarchical storage paradigms, and be easily accessed as \"a future device for individual use ... a sort of mechanized private file and library\" in the shape of a desk. The memex was also intended as a tool to study the brain itself. The structure of memex is considered a precursor to the World Wide Web.\nAfter thinking about the potential of augmented memory for several years, Bush set out his thoughts at length in \"As We May Think\", predicting that \"wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified\". \"As We May Think\" was published in the July 1945 issue of \"The Atlantic\". A few months later, \"Life\" magazine published a condensed version of \"As We May Think\", accompanied by several illustrations showing the possible appearance of a memex machine and its companion devices.\nShortly after \"As We May Think\" was originally published, Douglas Engelbart read it, and with Bush's visions in mind, commenced work that would later lead to the invention of the mouse. Ted Nelson, who coined the terms \"hypertext\" and \"hypermedia\", was also greatly influenced by Bush's essay.\n\"As We May Think\" has turned out to be a visionary and influential essay. In their introduction to a paper discussing information literacy as a discipline, Bill Johnston and Sheila Webber wrote in 2005 that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Bush's paper might be regarded as describing a microcosm of the information society, with the boundaries tightly drawn by the interests and experiences of a major scientist of the time, rather than the more open knowledge spaces of the 21st\u00a0century. Bush provides a core vision of the importance of information to industrial / scientific society, using the image of an \"information explosion\" arising from the unprecedented demands on scientific production and technological application of World War\u00a0II. He outlines a version of information science as a key discipline within the practice of scientific and technical knowledge domains. His view encompasses the problems of information overload and the need to devise efficient mechanisms to control and channel information for use.\nBush was concerned that information overload might inhibit the research efforts of scientists. Looking to the future, he predicted a time when \"there is a growing mountain of research. But there is increased evidence that we are being bogged down today as specialization extends. The investigator is staggered by the findings and conclusions of thousands of other workers.\"\nNational Science Foundation.\nThe OSRD continued to function actively until some time after the end of hostilities, but by 1946\u20131947 it had been reduced to a minimal staff charged with finishing work remaining from the war period; Bush was calling for its closure even before the war had ended. During the war, the OSRD had issued contracts as it had seen fit, with just eight organizations accounting for half of its spending. MIT was the largest to receive funds, with its obvious ties to Bush and his close associates. Efforts to obtain legislation exempting the OSRD from the usual government conflict of interest regulations failed, leaving Bush and other OSRD principals open to prosecution. Bush therefore pressed for OSRD to be wound up as soon as possible.\nWith its dissolution, Bush and others had hoped that an equivalent peacetime government research and development agency would replace the OSRD. Bush felt that basic research was important to national survival for both military and commercial reasons, requiring continued government support for science and technology; technical superiority could be a deterrent to future enemy aggression. In \"Science, The Endless Frontier\", a July 1945 report to the president, Bush maintained that basic research was \"the pacemaker of technological progress\". \"New products and new processes do not appear full-grown,\" Bush wrote in the report. \"They are founded on new principles and new conceptions, which in turn are painstakingly developed by research in the purest realms of science!\" In Bush's view, the \"purest realms\" were the physical and medical sciences; he did not propose funding the social sciences. In \"Science, The Endless Frontier\", science historian Daniel Kevles later wrote, Bush \"insisted upon the principle of Federal patronage for the advancement of knowledge in the United States, a departure that came to govern Federal science policy after World War\u00a0II.\"\nIn July 1945, the Kilgore bill was introduced in Congress, proposing the appointment and removal of a single science administrator by the president, with emphasis on applied research, and a patent clause favoring a government monopoly. In contrast, the competing Magnuson bill was similar to Bush's proposal to vest control in a panel of top scientists and civilian administrators with the executive director appointed by them. The Magnuson bill emphasized basic research and protected private patent rights. A compromise Kilgore\u2013Magnuson bill of February 1946 passed the Senate but expired in the House because Bush favored a competing bill that was a virtual duplicate of Magnuson's original bill. A Senate bill was introduced in February 1947 to create the National Science Foundation (NSF) to replace the OSRD. This bill favored most of the features advocated by Bush, including the controversial administration by an autonomous scientific board. The bill passed the Senate and the House, but was pocket vetoed by Truman on August 6, on the grounds that the administrative officers were not properly responsible to either the president or Congress. The OSRD was abolished without a successor organization on December 31, 1947.\nWithout a National Science Foundation, the military stepped in, with the Office of Naval Research (ONR) filling the gap. The war had accustomed many scientists to working without the budgetary constraints imposed by pre-war universities. Bush helped create the Joint Research and Development Board (JRDB) of the Army and Navy, of which he was chairman. With passage of the National Security Act on July 26, 1947, the JRDB became the Research and Development Board (RDB). Its role was to promote research through the military until a bill creating the National Science Foundation finally became law. By 1953, the Department of Defense was spending $1.6\u00a0billion a year on research; physicists were spending 70\u00a0percent of their time on defense related research, and 98\u00a0percent of the money spent on physics came from either the Department of Defense or the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), which took over from the Manhattan Project on January 1, 1947. Legislation to create the National Science Foundation finally passed through Congress and was signed into law by Truman in 1950.\nThe authority that Bush had as chairman of the RDB was much different from the power and influence he enjoyed as director of OSRD and would have enjoyed in the agency he had hoped would be independent of the Executive branch and Congress. He was never happy with the position and resigned as chairman of the RDB after a year, but remained on the oversight committee. He continued to be skeptical about rockets and missiles, writing in his 1949 book, \"Modern Arms and Free Men\", that intercontinental ballistic missiles would not be technically feasible \"for a long time to come ... if ever\".\nPanels and boards.\nWith Truman as president, men like John R. Steelman, who was appointed chairman of the President's Scientific Research Board in October 1946, came to prominence. Bush's authority, both among scientists and politicians, suffered a rapid decline, though he remained a revered figure. In September 1949, he was appointed to head a scientific panel that included Oppenheimer to review the evidence that the Soviet Union had tested its first atomic bomb. The panel concluded that it had, and this finding was relayed to Truman, who made the public announcement. During 1952 Bush was one of five members of the State Department Panel of Consultants on Disarmament, and led the panel in urging that the United States postpone its planned first test of the hydrogen bomb and seek a test ban with the Soviet Union, on the grounds that avoiding a test might forestall development of a catastrophic new weapon and open the way for new arms agreements between the two nations. The panel lacked political allies in Washington, however, and the Ivy Mike shot went ahead as scheduled. Bush was outraged when a security hearing stripped Oppenheimer of his security clearance in 1954; he issued a strident attack on Oppenheimer's accusers in \"The New York Times\". Alfred Friendly summed up the feeling of many scientists in declaring that Bush had become \"the Grand Old Man of American science\".\nBush continued to serve on the NACA through 1948 and expressed annoyance with aircraft companies for delaying development of a turbojet engine because of the huge expense of research and development as well as retooling from older piston engines. He was similarly disappointed with the automobile industry, which showed no interest in his proposals for more fuel-efficient engines. General Motors told him that \"even if it were a better engine, [General Motors] would not be interested in it.\" Bush likewise deplored trends in advertising. \"Madison Avenue believes\", he said, \"that if you tell the public something absurd, but do it enough times, the public will ultimately register it in its stock of accepted verities.\"\nFrom 1947 to 1962, Bush was on the board of directors for American Telephone and Telegraph. He retired as president of the Carnegie Institution and returned to Massachusetts in 1955, but remained a director of Metals and Controls Corporation from 1952 to 1959, and of Merck &amp; Co. 1949\u20131962. Bush became chairman of the board at Merck following the death of George W. Merck, serving until 1962. He worked closely with the company's president, Max Tishler, although Bush was concerned about Tishler's reluctance to delegate responsibility. Bush distrusted the company's sales organization, but supported Tishler's research and development efforts. He was a trustee of Tufts College 1943\u20131962, of Johns Hopkins University 1943\u20131955, of the Carnegie Corporation of New York 1939\u20131950, the Carnegie Institution of Washington 1958\u20131974, and the George Putnam Fund of Boston 1956\u20131972, and was a regent of the Smithsonian Institution 1943\u20131955.\nFinal years and death.\nAfter suffering a stroke, Bush died in Belmont, Massachusetts at the age of 84 from pneumonia on June 28, 1974. He was survived by his sons Richard (a surgeon) and John (president of Millipore Corporation) and by six grandchildren and his sister Edith. Bush's wife had died in 1969. He was buried at South Dennis Cemetery in South Dennis, Massachusetts, after a private funeral service. At a public memorial subsequently held by MIT, Jerome Wiesner declared \"No American has had greater influence in the growth of science and technology than Vannevar Bush\".\nAwards and honors.\nIn 1980, the National Science Foundation created the Vannevar Bush Award to honor his contributions to public service. The Vannevar Bush papers are located in several places, with the majority of the collection held at the Library of Congress. Additional papers are held by the MIT Institute Archives and Special Collections, the Carnegie Institution, and the National Archives and Records Administration.\nAs of 2023[ [update]], the Vannevar Bush Distinguished Professor is Michael Levin, an American developmental and synthetic biologist at Tufts University.\nIn popular culture.\nIn the 1947 film \"The Beginning or the End\", Bush is played by Jonathan Hale.\nBush is played by Matthew Modine in Christopher Nolan's 2023 film \"Oppenheimer\".\nBibliography.\n(complete list of published papers: ).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is characterized by polycystic disease and benign tumors with potential for subsequent malignant transformation. It is a type of phakomatosis that results from a mutation in the Von Hippel\u2013Lindau tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 3p25.3.\nSigns and symptoms.\nSigns and symptoms associated with VHL disease include headaches, problems with balance and walking, dizziness, weakness of the limbs, vision problems, and high blood pressure.\nSix organ systems mainly are affected: CNS (Central Nervous System); retina; pancreas; kidney; adrenal gland; epididymis.\nConditions associated with VHL disease include angiomatosis, hemangioblastomas, pheochromocytoma, renal cell carcinoma, pancreatic cysts (pancreatic serous cystadenoma), endolymphatic sac tumor, and bilateral papillary cystadenomas of the epididymis (men) or broad ligament of the uterus (women). Angiomatosis occurs in 37.2% of patients presenting with VHL disease and usually occurs in the retina. As a result, loss of vision is very common. However, other organs can be affected: strokes, heart attacks, and cardiovascular disease are common additional symptoms. Approximately 40% of VHL disease presents with CNS hemangioblastomas and they are present in around 60\u201380%. Spinal hemangioblastomas are found in 13\u201359% of VHL disease and are specific because 80% are found in VHL disease. Although all of these tumors are common in VHL disease, around half of cases present with only one tumor type. Most people with VHL develop symptoms in their mid-twenties.\nPathogenesis.\nThe disease is caused by mutations of the Von Hippel\u2013Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) gene on the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p25-26). There are over 1500 germline mutations and somatic mutations found in VHL disease.\nEvery cell in the body has two copies of every gene (bar those found in the sex chromosomes, X and Y). In VHL disease, one copy of the VHL gene has a mutation and produces a faulty VHL protein (pVHL). However, the second copy still produces a functional protein. The condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner \u2013 one copy of the faulty gene is sufficient to increase the risk of developing tumours.\nApproximately 20% of cases of VHL disease are found in individuals without a family history, known as \"de novo\" mutations. An inherited mutation of the VHL gene is responsible for the remaining 80 percent of cases.\nOf mutations in the VHL gene, 30\u201340% consist of 50-250kb deletion mutations that remove either part of the gene or the whole gene and flanking regions of DNA. The remaining 60\u201370% of VHL disease is caused by the truncation of pVHL by nonsense mutations, indel mutations or splice site mutations.\nVHL protein.\nThe VHL protein (pVHL) is involved in the regulation of a protein known as hypoxia inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF1\u03b1). This is a subunit of a heterodimeric transcription factor that at normal cellular oxygen levels is highly regulated. In normal physiological conditions, pVHL recognizes and binds to HIF1\u03b1 only when oxygen is present due to the post translational hydroxylation of two proline residues within the HIF1\u03b1 protein. pVHL is an E3 ligase that ubiquitinates HIF1\u03b1 and causes its degradation by the proteasome. In low oxygen conditions or in cases of VHL disease where the VHL gene is mutated, pVHL does not bind to HIF1\u03b1. This allows the subunit to dimerise with HIF1\u03b2 and activate the transcription of a number of genes, including vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor B, erythropoietin and genes involved in glucose uptake and metabolism. A new novel missense mutation in VHL genes c.194 C&gt;T, c.239 G&gt;A, c.278 G&gt;A, c.319 C&gt;G, c.337 C&gt;G leading to the following variations p.Ala 65 Val, p.Gly 80 Asp, p.Gly 93 Glu, p.Gln 107 Glu, p.Gln 113 Glu in the protein contributed to renal clear cell carcinoma.\nDiagnosis.\nThe detection of tumours specific to VHL disease is important in the disease's diagnosis. In individuals with a family history of VHL disease, one hemangioblastoma, pheochromocytoma or renal cell carcinoma may be sufficient to make a diagnosis. As all the tumours associated with VHL disease can be found sporadically, at least two tumours must be identified to diagnose VHL disease in a person without a family history.\nGenetic diagnosis is also useful in VHL disease diagnosis. In hereditary VHL disease, techniques such as the Southern blot and gene sequencing can be used to analyse DNA and identify mutations. These tests can be used to screen family members of those afflicted with VHL disease; \"de novo\" cases that produce genetic mosaicism are more difficult to detect because mutations are not found in the white blood cells that are used for genetic analysis.\nClassification.\nVon Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is classified into two main types based on the presence or absence of pheochromocytoma (pheo). VHL type 1 is characterized by the absence of pheo, while VHL type 2 encompasses individuals with pheo and is further divided into three subcategories: type 2A, type 2B, and type 2C. Diagnosis of VHL is guided by two key criteria. The first involves patients with a family history of developing hemangioblastomas (HB) in the central nervous system (CNS) or retinal angiomas (RA), pheo, pancreatic tumors or cysts, or epididymal cystadenomas. The second criterion applies to patients without a family history of VHL disease who present with hemangioblastomas or retinal angiomas in conjunction with other tumors such as renal cell carcinoma (RCC), pheo, pancreatic tumors or cysts, or epididymal cystadenomas.\nClassification terms.\nPheo - A pheochromocytoma is an adrenal tumor that makes and releases excess catecholamines. These tumors can cause serious health problems including stroke, heart attack, and even death.\nHemangioblastomas - a hemangioblastoma is a tumor that grows in the blood vessels of your brain, spinal cord or retina. It isn\u2019t cancerous, but it may grow and press on surrounding tissues. Usually, healthcare providers recommend removing a hemangioblastoma with surgery. After removal, a hemangioblastoma is unlikely to grow back.\nRetina angiomas - retinal capillary hemangiomas also known as retinal hemangioblastomas, occur most frequently in conjunction with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome. These lesions are characterized by plump, but otherwise normal, retinal capillary endothelial cells with normal pericytes and basement membrane.\nEpidydimal cystadenomas- A cyst that grows on the male testes. \nRenal cell carcinoma- The most common type of kidney cancer.\nTreatment.\nEarly recognition and treatment of specific manifestations of VHL can substantially decrease complications and improve quality of life. For this reason, individuals with VHL disease are usually screened routinely for retinal angiomas, CNS hemangioblastomas, clear-cell renal carcinomas and pheochromocytomas. CNS hemangioblastomas are usually surgically removed if they are symptomatic. Photocoagulation and cryotherapy are usually used for the treatment of symptomatic retinal angiomas, although anti-angiogenic treatments may also be an option. Renal tumours may be removed by a partial nephrectomy or other techniques such as radiofrequency ablation.\nBelzutifan is a drug approved for the treatment of von Hippel\u2013Lindau disease-associated renal cell carcinoma and sold by Merck under the name Welireg.\nEpidemiology.\nVHL disease has an incidence of one in 36,000 births. There is over 90% penetrance by the age of 65. Age at diagnosis varies from infancy to age 60\u201370 years, with an average patient age at clinical diagnosis of 26 years.\nHistory.\nThe German ophthalmologist Eugen von Hippel first described angiomas in the eye in 1904. Arvid Lindau described the angiomas of the cerebellum and spine in 1927. The term \"Von Hippel\u2013Lindau disease\" was first used in 1936; however, its use became common only in the 1970s.\nNotable cases.\nSome descendants of the McCoy family (involved in the Hatfield\u2013McCoy feud along West Virginia\u2013Kentucky border in the US) are presumed to have VHL. In an article appearing in the Associated Press, it has been speculated by a Vanderbilt University endocrinologist that the hostility underlying the Hatfield\u2013McCoy feud may have been partly due to the consequences of Von Hippel\u2013Lindau disease. The article suggests that the McCoy family was predisposed to bad tempers because many of them had a pheochromocytoma that produced excess adrenaline and a tendency toward explosive tempers. An update of the Associated Press article in 2023 carries more details.\nNomenclature.\nOther uncommon names are: angiomatosis retinae, familial cerebello-retinal angiomatosis, cerebelloretinal hemangioblastomatosis, Hippel Disease, Hippel\u2013Lindau syndrome, HLS, VHL, Lindau disease and retinocerebellar angiomatosis.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The toxin is delivered through a specially evolved \"venom apparatus\", such as fangs or a stinger, in a process called \"envenomation\". Venom is often distinguished from \"poison\", which is a toxin that is passively delivered by being ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin, and \"toxungen\", which is actively transferred to the external surface of another animal via a physical delivery mechanism.\nVenom has evolved in terrestrial and marine environments and in a wide variety of animals: both predators and prey, and both vertebrates and invertebrates. Venoms kill through the action of at least four major classes of toxin, namely necrotoxins and cytotoxins, which kill cells; neurotoxins, which affect nervous systems; myotoxins, which damage muscles; and haemotoxins, which disrupt blood clotting. Venomous animals cause tens of thousands of human deaths per year.\nVenoms are often complex mixtures of toxins of differing types. Toxins from venom are used to treat a wide range of medical conditions including thrombosis, arthritis, and some cancers. Studies in venomics are investigating the potential use of venom toxins for many other conditions.\nEvolution.\nThe use of venom across a wide variety of taxa is an example of convergent evolution. In animals, venom usage has evolved independently at least 104 times, across 8 phyla. It is difficult to conclude exactly how this trait came to be so intensely widespread and diversified. The multigene families that encode the toxins of venomous animals are actively selected, creating more diverse toxins with specific functions. \nAlso, a number of animal species have been demonstrated to acquire venom toxins from other sources, notably from associated microbes, which may even inhabit their venom apparatuses. \nVenoms adapt to their environment and victims, evolving to become maximally efficient on a predator's particular prey (particularly the precise ion channels within the prey). Consequently, some venoms may become specialized to an animal's standard diet.\nMechanisms.\nVenoms cause their biological effects via the many toxins that they contain; some venoms are complex mixtures of toxins of differing types. Major classes of toxin in venoms include:\nA subclass of cytotoxins is the necrotoxins, which cause necrosis (i.e., death) in the cells and tissues they encounter. The complex venoms of vipers and bees contain phospholipases; viper venoms often also contain trypsin-like serine proteases.\nTaxonomic range.\nVenom is widely distributed taxonomically, being found in both invertebrates and vertebrates, in aquatic and terrestrial animals, and among both predators and prey. The major groups of venomous animals are described below.\nArthropods.\nVenomous arthropods include spiders, which use fangs on their chelicerae to inject venom, and centipedes, which use modified to deliver venom, while scorpions and stinging insects inject venom with a sting. In bees and wasps, the stinger is a modified ovipositor (egg-laying device). In \"Polistes fuscatus\", the female continuously releases a venom that contains a sex pheromone that induces copulatory behavior in males. In wasps such as \"Polistes exclamans\", venom is used as an alarm pheromone, coordinating a response from the nest and attracting nearby wasps to attack the predator. In some species, such as \"Parischnogaster striatula\", venom is applied all over the body as an antimicrobial protection.\nMany caterpillars have defensive venom glands associated with specialized bristles on the body called urticating hairs. These are usually merely irritating, but those of the \"Lonomia\" moth can be fatal to humans.\nBees synthesize and employ an acidic venom (apitoxin) to defend their hives and food stores, whereas wasps use a chemically different venom to paralyse prey, so their prey remains alive to provision the food chambers of their young. The use of venom is much more widespread than just these examples; many other insects, such as true bugs and many ants, also produce venom. The ant species \"Polyrhachis dives\" uses venom topically for the sterilisation of pathogens.\nOther invertebrates.\nThere are venomous invertebrates in several phyla, including jellyfish such as the dangerous box jellyfish, the Portuguese man-of-war (a siphonophore) and sea anemones among the Cnidaria, sea urchins among the Echinodermata, and cone snails and cephalopods, including octopuses, among the Molluscs.\nVertebrates.\nFish.\nVenom is found in some 200 cartilaginous fishes, including stingrays, sharks, and chimaeras; the catfishes (about 1000 venomous species); and 11 clades of spiny-rayed fishes (Acanthomorpha), containing the scorpionfishes (over 300 species), stonefishes (over 80 species), gurnard perches, blennies, rabbitfishes, surgeonfishes, some velvetfishes, some toadfishes, coral crouchers, red velvetfishes, scats, rockfishes, deepwater scorpionfishes, waspfishes, weevers, and stargazers.\nAmphibians.\nSome salamanders can extrude sharp venom-tipped ribs. Two frog species in Brazil have tiny spines around the crown of their skulls which, on impact, deliver venom into their targets.\nReptiles.\nSome 450 species of snake are venomous. Snake venom is produced by glands below the eye (the mandibular glands) and delivered to the target through tubular or channeled fangs. Snake venoms contain a variety of peptide toxins, including proteases, which hydrolyze protein peptide bonds; nucleases, which hydrolyze the phosphodiester bonds of DNA; and neurotoxins, which disrupt signalling in the nervous system. Snake venom causes symptoms including pain, swelling, tissue necrosis, low blood pressure, convulsions, haemorrhage (varying by species of snake), respiratory paralysis, kidney failure, coma, and death. Snake venom may have originated with duplication of genes that had been expressed in the salivary glands of ancestors.\nVenom is found in a few other reptiles such as the Mexican beaded lizard, the gila monster, and some monitor lizards, including the Komodo dragon. Mass spectrometry showed that the mixture of proteins present in their venom is as complex as the mixture of proteins found in snake venom.\nSome lizards possess a venom gland; they form a hypothetical clade, Toxicofera, containing the suborders Serpentes and Iguania and the families Varanidae, Anguidae, and Helodermatidae.\nMammals.\n\"Euchambersia\", an extinct genus of therocephalians, is hypothesized to have had venom glands attached to its canine teeth.\nA few species of living mammals are venomous, including solenodons, shrews, the European mole, vampire bats, male platypuses, and slow lorises. Shrews have venomous saliva and most likely evolved their trait similarly to snakes. The presence of tarsal spurs akin to those of the platypus in many non-therian Mammaliaformes groups suggests that venom was an ancestral characteristic among mammals.\nExtensive research on platypuses shows that their toxin was initially formed from gene duplication, but data provides evidence that the further evolution of platypus venom does not rely as much on gene duplication as was once thought. Modified sweat glands are what evolved into platypus venom glands. Although it is proven that reptile and platypus venom have independently evolved, it is thought that there are certain protein structures that are favored to evolve into toxic molecules. This provides more evidence of why venom has become a homoplastic trait and why very different animals have convergently evolved.\nVenom and humans.\nEnvenomation resulted in 57,000 human deaths in 2013, down from 76,000 deaths in 1990. Venoms, found in over 173,000 species, have potential to treat a wide range of diseases, explored in over 5,000 scientific papers.\nIn medicine, snake venom proteins are used to treat conditions including thrombosis, arthritis, and some cancers. Gila monster venom contains exenatide, used to treat type 2 diabetes. Solenopsins extracted from fire ant venom has demonstrated biomedical applications, ranging from cancer treatment to psoriasis. A branch of science, venomics, has been established to study the proteins associated with venom and how individual components of venom can be used for pharmaceutical means.\nResistance.\nVenom is used as a trophic weapon by many predator species. The coevolution between predators and prey is the driving force of venom resistance, which has evolved multiple times throughout the animal kingdom. The coevolution between venomous predators and venom-resistant prey has been described as a chemical arms race. Predator/prey pairs are expected to coevolve over long periods of time. As the predator capitalizes on susceptible individuals, the surviving individuals are limited to those able to evade predation. Resistance typically increases over time as the predator becomes increasingly unable to subdue resistant prey. The cost of developing venom resistance is high for both predator and prey. The payoff for the cost of physiological resistance is an increased chance of survival for prey, but it allows predators to expand into underutilised trophic niches.\nThe California ground squirrel has varying degrees of resistance to the venom of the Northern Pacific rattlesnake. The resistance involves toxin scavenging and depends on the population. Where rattlesnake populations are denser, squirrel resistance is higher. Rattlesnakes have responded locally by increasing the effectiveness of their venom.\nThe kingsnakes of the Americas are constrictors that prey on many venomous snakes. They have evolved resistance which does not vary with age or exposure. They are immune to the venom of snakes in their immediate environment, like copperheads, cottonmouths, and North American rattlesnakes, but not to the venom of, for example, king cobras or black mambas.\nAmong marine animals, eels are resistant to sea snake venoms, which contain complex mixtures of neurotoxins, myotoxins, and nephrotoxins, varying according to species. Eels are especially resistant to the venom of sea snakes that specialise in feeding on them, implying coevolution; non-prey fishes have little resistance to sea snake venom.\nClownfish always live among the tentacles of venomous sea anemones (an obligatory symbiosis for the fish), and are resistant to their venom. Only 10 known species of anemones are hosts to clownfish and only certain pairs of anemones and clownfish are compatible. All sea anemones produce venoms delivered through discharging nematocysts and mucous secretions. The toxins are composed of peptides and proteins. They are used to acquire prey and to deter predators by causing pain, loss of muscular coordination, and tissue damage. Clownfish have a protective mucus that acts as a chemical camouflage or macromolecular mimicry preventing \"not self\" recognition by the sea anemone and nematocyst discharge. Clownfish may acclimate their mucus to resemble that of a specific species of sea anemone.\nNon-animal venoms.\nVenoms in the sense of actively delivered toxins are not restricted to animals; all domains and kingdoms of life have evolved some version of a \"venom\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a subfield of microbiology that focuses on their detection, structure, classification and evolution, their methods of infection and exploitation of host cells for reproduction, their interaction with host organism physiology and immunity, the diseases they cause, the techniques to isolate and culture them, and their use in research and therapy.\nThe identification of the causative agent of tobacco mosaic disease (TMV) as a novel pathogen by Martinus Beijerinck (1898) is now acknowledged as being the official beginning of the field of virology as a discipline distinct from bacteriology. He realized the source was neither a bacterial nor a fungal infection, but something completely different. Beijerinck used the word \"virus\" to describe the mysterious agent in his 'contagium vivum fluidum' ('contagious living fluid'). Rosalind Franklin proposed the full structure of the tobacco mosaic virus in 1955.\nOne main motivation for the study of viruses is because they cause many infectious diseases of plants and animals. The study of the manner in which viruses cause disease is viral pathogenesis. The degree to which a virus causes disease is its virulence. These fields of study are called plant virology, animal virology and human or medical virology. \nVirology began when there were no methods for propagating or visualizing viruses or specific laboratory tests for viral infections. The methods for separating viral nucleic acids (RNA and DNA) and proteins, which are now the mainstay of virology, did not exist. Now there are many methods for observing the structure and functions of viruses and their component parts. Thousands of different viruses are now known about and virologists often specialize in either the viruses that infect plants, or bacteria and other microorganisms, or animals. Viruses that infect humans are now studied by medical virologists. Virology is a broad subject covering biology, health, animal welfare, agriculture and ecology.\nHistory.\nLouis Pasteur was unable to find a causative agent for rabies and speculated about a pathogen too small to be detected by microscopes. In 1884, the French microbiologist Charles Chamberland invented the Chamberland filter (or Pasteur-Chamberland filter) with pores small enough to remove all bacteria from a solution passed through it. In 1892, the Russian biologist Dmitri Ivanovsky used this filter to study what is now known as the tobacco mosaic virus: crushed leaf extracts from infected tobacco plants remained infectious even after filtration to remove bacteria. Ivanovsky suggested the infection might be caused by a toxin produced by bacteria, but he did not pursue the idea. At the time it was thought that all infectious agents could be retained by filters and grown on a nutrient medium\u2014this was part of the germ theory of disease.\nIn 1898, the Dutch microbiologist Martinus Beijerinck repeated the experiments and became convinced that the filtered solution contained a new form of infectious agent. He observed that the agent multiplied only in cells that were dividing, but as his experiments did not show that it was made of particles, he called it a \"contagium vivum fluidum\" (soluble living germ) and reintroduced the word \"virus\". Beijerinck maintained that viruses were liquid in nature, a theory later discredited by Wendell Stanley, who proved they were particulate. In the same year, Friedrich Loeffler and Paul Frosch passed the first animal virus, aphthovirus (the agent of foot-and-mouth disease), through a similar filter.\nIn the early 20th century, the English bacteriologist Frederick Twort discovered a group of viruses that infect bacteria, now called bacteriophages (or commonly 'phages'), in 1915. The French-Canadian microbiologist F\u00e9lix d'Herelle announced his independent discovery of bacteriophages in 1917. D'Herelle described viruses that, when added to bacteria on an agar plate, would produce areas of dead bacteria. He accurately diluted a suspension of these viruses and discovered that the highest dilutions (lowest virus concentrations), rather than killing all the bacteria, formed discrete areas of dead organisms. Counting these areas and multiplying by the dilution factor allowed him to calculate the number of viruses in the original suspension. Phages were heralded as a potential treatment for diseases such as typhoid and cholera, but their promise was forgotten with the development of penicillin. The development of bacterial resistance to antibiotics has renewed interest in the therapeutic use of bacteriophages.\nBy the end of the 19th century, viruses were defined in terms of their infectivity, their ability to pass filters, and their requirement for living hosts. Viruses had been grown only in plants and animals. In 1906 Ross Granville Harrison invented a method for growing tissue in lymph, and in 1913 E.\u00a0Steinhardt, C.\u00a0Israeli, and R.A. Lambert used this method to grow vaccinia virus in fragments of guinea pig corneal tissue. In 1928, H. B. Maitland and M. C. Maitland grew vaccinia virus in suspensions of minced hens' kidneys. Their method was not widely adopted until the 1950s when poliovirus was grown on a large scale for vaccine production.\nAnother breakthrough came in 1931 when the American pathologist Ernest William Goodpasture and Alice Miles Woodruff grew influenza and several other viruses in fertilised chicken eggs. In 1949, John Franklin Enders, Thomas Weller, and Frederick Robbins grew poliovirus in cultured cells from aborted human embryonic tissue, the first virus to be grown without using solid animal tissue or eggs. This work enabled Hilary Koprowski, and then Jonas Salk, to make an effective polio vaccine.\nThe first images of viruses were obtained upon the invention of electron microscopy in 1931 by the German engineers Ernst Ruska and Max Knoll. In 1935, American biochemist and virologist Wendell Meredith Stanley examined the tobacco mosaic virus and found it was mostly made of protein. A short time later, this virus was separated into protein and RNA parts.\nThe tobacco mosaic virus was the first to be crystallised and its structure could, therefore, be elucidated in detail. The first X-ray diffraction pictures of the crystallised virus were obtained by Bernal and Fankuchen in 1941. Based on her X-ray crystallographic pictures, Rosalind Franklin discovered the full structure of the virus in 1955. In the same year, Heinz Fraenkel-Conrat and Robley Williams showed that purified tobacco mosaic virus RNA and its protein coat can assemble by themselves to form functional viruses, suggesting that this simple mechanism was probably the means through which viruses were created within their host cells.\nThe second half of the 20th century was the golden age of virus discovery, and most of the documented species of animal, plant, and bacterial viruses were discovered during these years. In 1946, bovine viral diarrhoea (a pestivirus) was first described. In 1957 equine arterivirus was discovered. In 1963 the hepatitis B virus was discovered by Baruch Blumberg. In 1965 Howard Temin described the first retrovirus. Reverse transcriptase, the enzyme that retroviruses use to make DNA copies of their RNA, was first described in 1970 by Temin and David Baltimore independently. In 1983 Luc Montagnier's team at the Pasteur Institute in France, first isolated the retrovirus now called HIV. In 1989 Michael Houghton's team at Chiron Corporation discovered hepatitis C.\nDetecting viruses.\nThere are several approaches to detecting viruses and these include the detection of virus particles (virions) or their antigens or nucleic acids and infectivity assays.\nElectron microscopy.\nViruses were seen for the first time in the 1930s when electron microscopes were invented. These microscopes use beams of electrons instead of light, which have a much shorter wavelength and can detect objects that cannot be seen using light microscopes. The highest magnification obtainable by electron microscopes is up to 10,000,000 times whereas for light microscopes it is around 1,500 times.\nVirologists often use negative staining to help visualise viruses. In this procedure, the viruses are suspended in a solution of metal salts such as uranium acetate. The atoms of metal are opaque to electrons and the viruses are seen as suspended in a dark background of metal atoms. This technique has been in use since the 1950s. Many viruses were discovered using this technique and negative staining electron microscopy is still a valuable weapon in a virologist's arsenal.\nTraditional electron microscopy has disadvantages in that viruses are damaged by drying in the high vacuum inside the electron microscope and the electron beam itself is destructive. In cryogenic electron microscopy the structure of viruses is preserved by embedding them in an environment of vitreous water. This allows the determination of biomolecular structures at near-atomic resolution, and has attracted wide attention to the approach as an alternative to X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy for the determination of the structure of viruses.\nGrowth in cultures.\nViruses are obligate intracellular parasites and because they only reproduce inside the living cells of a host these cells are needed to grow them in the laboratory. For viruses that infect animals (usually called \"animal viruses\") cells grown in laboratory cell cultures are used. In the past, fertile hens' eggs were used and the viruses were grown on the membranes surrounding the embryo. This method is still used in the manufacture of some vaccines. For the viruses that infect bacteria, the bacteriophages, the bacteria growing in test tubes can be used directly. For plant viruses, the natural host plants can be used or, particularly when the infection is not obvious, so-called indicator plants, which show signs of infection more clearly.\nViruses that have grown in cell cultures can be indirectly detected by the detrimental effect they have on the host cell. These cytopathic effects are often characteristic of the type of virus. For instance, herpes simplex viruses produce a characteristic \"ballooning\" of the cells, typically human fibroblasts. Some viruses, such as mumps virus cause red blood cells from chickens to firmly attach to the infected cells. This is called \"haemadsorption\" or \"hemadsorption\". Some viruses produce localised \"lesions\" in cell layers called plaques, which are useful in quantitation assays and in identifying the species of virus by plaque reduction assays.\nViruses growing in cell cultures are used to measure their susceptibility to validated and novel antiviral drugs.\nSerology.\nViruses are antigens that induce the production of antibodies and these antibodies can be used in laboratories to study viruses. Related viruses often react with each other's antibodies and some viruses can be named based on the antibodies they react with. The use of the antibodies which were once exclusively derived from the serum (blood fluid) of animals is called serology. Once an antibody\u2013reaction has taken place in a test, other methods are needed to confirm this. Older methods included complement fixation tests, hemagglutination inhibition and virus neutralisation. Newer methods use enzyme immunoassays (EIA).\nIn the years before PCR was invented immunofluorescence was used to quickly confirm viral infections. It is an infectivity assay that is virus species specific because antibodies are used. The antibodies are tagged with a dye that is luminescencent and when using an optical microscope with a modified light source, infected cells glow in the dark.\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) and other nucleic acid detection methods.\nPCR is a mainstay method for detecting viruses in all species including plants and animals. It works by detecting traces of virus specific RNA or DNA. It is very sensitive and specific, but can be easily compromised by contamination. Most of the tests used in veterinary virology and medical virology are based on PCR or similar methods such as transcription mediated amplification. When a novel virus emerges, such as the covid coronavirus, a specific test can be devised quickly so long as the viral genome has been sequenced and unique regions of the viral DNA or RNA identified. The invention of microfluidic tests as allowed for most of these tests to be automated, Despite its specificity and sensitivity, PCR has a disadvantage in that it does not differentiate infectious and non-infectious viruses and \"tests of cure\" have to be delayed for up to 21 days to allow for residual viral nucleic acid to clear from the site of the infection.\nDiagnostic tests.\nIn laboratories many of the diagnostic test for detecting viruses are nucleic acid amplification methods such as PCR. Some tests detect the viruses or their components as these include electron microscopy and enzyme-immunoassays. The so-called \"home\" or \"self\"-testing gadgets are usually lateral flow tests, which detect the virus using a tagged monoclonal antibody. These are also used in agriculture, food and environmental sciences.\nQuantitation and viral loads.\nCounting viruses (quantitation) has always had an important role in virology and has become central to the control of some infections of humans where the viral load is measured. There are two basic methods: those that count the fully infective virus particles, which are called infectivity assays, and those that count all the particles including the defective ones.\nInfectivity assays.\nInfectivity assays measure the amount (concentration) of infective viruses in a sample of known volume. For host cells, plants or cultures of bacterial or animal cells are used. Laboratory animals such as mice have also been used particularly in veterinary virology. These are assays are either quantitative where the results are on a continuous scale or quantal, where an event either occurs or it does not. Quantitative assays give absolute values and quantal assays give a statistical probability such as the volume of the test sample needed to ensure 50% of the hosts cells, plants or animals are infected. This is called the median infectious dose or ID 50. Infective bacteriophages can be counted by seeding them onto \"lawns\" of bacteria in culture dishes. When at low concentrations, the viruses form holes in the lawn that can be counted. The number of viruses is then expressed as plaque forming units. For the bacteriophages that reproduce in bacteria that cannot be grown in cultures, viral load assays are used.\nThe focus forming assay (FFA) is a variation of the plaque assay, but instead of relying on cell lysis in order to detect plaque formation, the FFA employs immunostaining techniques using fluorescently labeled antibodies specific for a viral antigen to detect infected host cells and infectious virus particles before an actual plaque is formed. The FFA is particularly useful for quantifying classes of viruses that do not lyse the cell membranes, as these viruses would not be amenable to the plaque assay. Like the plaque assay, host cell monolayers are infected with various dilutions of the virus sample and allowed to incubate for a relatively brief incubation period (e.g., 24\u201372 hours) under a semisolid overlay medium that restricts the spread of infectious virus, creating localized clusters (foci) of infected cells. Plates are subsequently probed with fluorescently labeled antibodies against a viral antigen, and fluorescence microscopy is used to count and quantify the number of foci. The FFA method typically yields results in less time than plaque or fifty-percent-tissue-culture-infective-dose (TCID50) assays, but it can be more expensive in terms of required reagents and equipment. Assay completion time is also dependent on the size of area that the user is counting. A larger area will require more time but can provide a more accurate representation of the sample. Results of the FFA are expressed as focus forming units per milliliter, or FFU/mL.\nViral load assays.\nWhen an assay for measuring the infective virus particle is done (Plaque assay, Focus assay), viral titre often refers to the concentration of infectious viral particles, which is different from the total viral particles. Viral load assays usually count the number of viral genomes present rather than the number of particles and use methods similar to PCR. Viral load tests are an important in the control of infections by HIV. This versatile method can be used for plant viruses.\nMolecular biology.\nMolecular virology is the study of viruses at the level of nucleic acids and proteins. The methods invented by molecular biologists have all proven useful in virology. Their small sizes and relatively simple structures make viruses an ideal candidate for study by these techniques.\nPurifying viruses and their components.\nFor further study, viruses grown in the laboratory need purifying to remove contaminants from the host cells. The methods used often have the advantage of concentrating the viruses, which makes it easier to investigate them.\nCentrifugation.\nCentrifuges are often used to purify viruses. Low speed centrifuges, i.e. those with a top speed of 10,000 revolutions per minute (rpm) are not powerful enough to concentrate viruses, but ultracentrifuges with a top speed of around 100,000\u00a0rpm, are and this difference is used in a method called differential centrifugation. In this method the larger and heavier contaminants are removed from a virus mixture by low speed centrifugation. The viruses, which are small and light and are left in suspension, are then concentrated by high speed centrifugation.\nFollowing differential centrifugation, virus suspensions often remain contaminated with debris that has the same sedimentation coefficient and are not removed by the procedure. In these cases a modification of centrifugation, called buoyant density centrifugation, is used. In this method the viruses recovered from differential centrifugation are centrifuged again at very high speed for several hours in dense solutions of sugars or salts that form a density gradient, from low to high, in the tube during the centrifugation. In some cases, preformed gradients are used where solutions of steadily decreasing density are carefully overlaid on each other. Like an object in the Dead Sea, despite the centrifugal force the virus particles cannot sink into solutions that are more dense than they are and they form discrete layers of, often visible, concentrated viruses in the tube. Caesium chloride is often used for these solutions as it is relatively inert but easily self-forms a gradient when centrifuged at high speed in an ultracentrifuge. Buoyant density centrifugation can also be used to purify the components of viruses such as their nucleic acids or proteins.\nElectrophoresis.\nThe separation of molecules based on their electric charge is called electrophoresis. Viruses and all their components can be separated and purified using this method. This is usually done in a supporting medium such as agarose and polyacrylamide gels. The separated molecules are revealed using stains such as coomasie blue, for proteins, or ethidium bromide for nucleic acids. In some instances the viral components are rendered radioactive before electrophoresis and are revealed using photographic film in a process known as autoradiography.\nSequencing of viral genomes.\nAs most viruses are too small to be seen by a light microscope, sequencing is one of the main tools in virology to identify and study the virus. Traditional Sanger sequencing and next-generation sequencing (NGS) are used to sequence viruses in basic and clinical research, as well as for the diagnosis of emerging viral infections, molecular epidemiology of viral pathogens, and drug-resistance testing. There are more than 2.3 million unique viral sequences in GenBank. NGS has surpassed traditional Sanger as the most popular approach for generating viral genomes. Viral genome sequencing as become a central method in viral epidemiology and viral classification.\nPhylogenetic analysis.\nData from the sequencing of viral genomes can be used to determine evolutionary relationships and this is called phylogenetic analysis. Software, such as PHYLIP, is used to draw phylogenetic trees. This analysis is also used in studying the spread of viral infections in communities (epidemiology).\nCloning.\nWhen purified viruses or viral components are needed for diagnostic tests or vaccines, cloning can be used instead of growing the viruses. At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic the availability of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA sequence enabled tests to be manufactured quickly. There are several proven methods for cloning viruses and their components. Small pieces of DNA called cloning vectors are often used and the most common ones are laboratory modified plasmids (small circular molecules of DNA produced by bacteria). The viral nucleic acid, or a part of it, is inserted in the plasmid, which is the copied many times over by bacteria. This recombinant DNA can then be used to produce viral components without the need for native viruses.\nPhage virology.\nThe viruses that reproduce in bacteria, archaea and fungi are informally called \"phages\", and the ones that infect bacteria \u2013 bacteriophages \u2013 in particular are useful in virology and biology in general. Bacteriophages were some of the first viruses to be discovered, early in the twentieth century, and because they are relatively easy to grow quickly in laboratories, much of our understanding of viruses originated by studying them. Bacteriophages, long known for their positive effects in the environment, are used in phage display techniques for screening proteins DNA sequences. They are a powerful tool in molecular biology.\nGenetics.\nAll viruses have genes which are studied using genetics. All the techniques used in molecular biology, such as cloning, creating mutations RNA silencing are used in viral genetics.\nReassortment.\nReassortment is the switching of genes from different parents and it is particularly useful when studying the genetics of viruses that have segmented genomes (fragmented into two or more nucleic acid molecules) such as influenza viruses and rotaviruses. The genes that encode properties such as serotype can be identified in this way.\nRecombination.\nOften confused with reassortment, recombination is also the mixing of genes but the mechanism differs in that \"stretches\" of DNA or RNA molecules, as opposed to the full molecules, are joined during the RNA or DNA replication cycle. Recombination is not as common as reassortment in nature but it is a powerful tool in laboratories for studying the structure and functions of viral genes.\nReverse genetics.\nReverse genetics is a powerful research method in virology. In this procedure complementary DNA (cDNA) copies of virus genomes called \"infectious clones\" are used to produce genetically modified viruses that can be then tested for changes in say, virulence or transmissibility.\nVirus classification.\nA major branch of virology is virus classification. It is artificial in that it is not based on evolutionary phylogenetics but it is based shared or distinguishing properties of viruses. It seeks to describe the diversity of viruses by naming and grouping them on the basis of similarities. In 1962, Andr\u00e9 Lwoff, Robert Horne, and Paul Tournier were the first to develop a means of virus classification, based on the Linnaean hierarchical system. This system based classification on phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. Viruses were grouped according to their shared properties (not those of their hosts) and the type of nucleic acid forming their genomes. In 1966, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) was formed. The system proposed by Lwoff, Horne and Tournier was initially not accepted by the ICTV because the small genome size of viruses and their high rate of mutation made it difficult to determine their ancestry beyond order. As such, the Baltimore classification system has come to be used to supplement the more traditional hierarchy. Starting in 2018, the ICTV began to acknowledge deeper evolutionary relationships between viruses that have been discovered over time and adopted a 15-rank classification system ranging from realm to species. Additionally, some species within the same genus are grouped into a \"genogroup\".\nICTV classification.\nThe ICTV developed the current classification system and wrote guidelines that put a greater weight on certain virus properties to maintain family uniformity. A unified taxonomy (a universal system for classifying viruses) has been established. Only a small part of the total diversity of viruses has been studied. As of 2021, 6 realms, 10 kingdoms, 17 phyla, 2 subphyla, 39 classes, 65 orders, 8 suborders, 233 families, 168 subfamilies, 2,606 genera, 84 subgenera, and 10,434 species of viruses have been defined by the ICTV.\nThe general taxonomic structure of taxon ranges and the suffixes used in taxonomic names are shown hereafter. As of 2021, the ranks of subrealm, subkingdom, and subclass are unused, whereas all other ranks are in use.\nRealm (\"-viria\")\nSubrealm (\"-vira\")\nKingdom (\"-virae\")\nSubkingdom (\"-virites\")\nPhylum (\"-viricota\")\nSubphylum (\"-viricotina\")\nClass (\"-viricetes\")\nSubclass (\"-viricetidae\")\nOrder (\"-virales\")\nSuborder (\"-virineae\")\nFamily (\"-viridae\")\nSubfamily (\"-virinae\")\nGenus (\"-virus\")\nSubgenus (\"-virus\")\nSpecies\nBaltimore classification.\nThe Nobel Prize-winning biologist David Baltimore devised the Baltimore classification system.\nThe Baltimore classification of viruses is based on the mechanism of mRNA production. Viruses must generate mRNAs from their genomes to produce proteins and replicate themselves, but different mechanisms are used to achieve this in each virus family. Viral genomes may be single-stranded (ss) or double-stranded (ds), RNA or DNA, and may or may not use reverse transcriptase (RT).

The school was founded in 1836 by the Wesleyan Methodist Church of Canada as a nonsectarian literary institution. From 1841 to 1890, Victoria operated as an independent degree-granting university, before federating with the University of Toronto in 1890, relocating from Cobourg to Toronto.\nThe school consists of two academic colleges:\nVictoria is situated in the northeastern part of the University of Toronto campus, adjacent to the University of St. Michael's College and Queen's Park. Among its residential halls is Annesley Hall, a National Historic Site of Canada. A major centre for Renaissance and Reformation studies, the university is home to international scholarly projects and holdings devoted to pre-Puritan English drama and the works of Desiderius Erasmus.\nHistory.\nVictoria College was founded as the Upper Canada Academy by the Wesleyan Methodist Church. In 1831, a church committee decided to locate the academy on four acres (1.6 hectares) of land in Cobourg, Ontario, east of Toronto, because of its central location in a large town and access by land and water. In 1836, Egerton Ryerson received a royal charter for the institution from King William IV in England, while the Upper Canadian government was hesitant to provide a charter to a Methodist institution. This was the first charter ever granted by the British Government to a Nonconformist body for an educational institution. The school officially opened to male and female students on October 12, 1836, with Matthew Richey as principal. Although the school taught a variety of liberal arts subjects, it also functioned as an unofficial Methodist seminary. In 1841, it was incorporated as Victoria College, named in honour of Queen Victoria, and finally received a charter from the Upper Canadian Legislature.\nVictoria University formed in 1884 with the merger of Victoria College and Albert College in Belleville. In 1890, due to financial and geographic difficulties, Victoria University federated with the University of Toronto. In 1892, Victoria University moved from Cobourg to its current campus on Queen's Park Crescent, south of Bloor Street (at Charles Street West), in Toronto.\nA plaque was erected at 100 University Avenue at the intersection with College Street in Cobourg, Ontario.\nVictoria College\nThe cornerstone of this building was laid June 7, 1832, and teaching began in 1836. First operated under a royal charter by the Wesleyan Methodists as Upper Canada Academy, in 1841 it obtained a provincial charter under the name of Victoria College, giving it power to grant degrees. Victoria's first president was the Reverend Egerton Ryerson, newspaper editor and founder of Ontario's present educational system. In 1890 the college federated with the University of Toronto and, in 1892, left Cobourg.\nJames Loudon, a former president of the federated universities, had prohibited dancing at the University of Toronto until 1896. However, dancing at Victoria was not officially permissible until thirty years later, in 1926.\nKing George V gifted to Victoria College a silver cup used by Queen Victoria when she was a child and the Royal Standard that had flown at Osborne House and was draped on the coffin of the Queen when she died there in 1901.\nTwo bronze plaques on either side of the South door of Victoria College were erected as memorials dedicated to the students of Victoria College who lost their lives in the First and Second World Wars. The WWI list of honour was erected by the Alumni and Alumnae Associations on October 13, 1923, while the WWII list of honour was erected by the Board of Regents.\nIn 1928, the independent Union College federated with the theology department of Victoria College, and became Emmanuel College.\n\"On the Old Ontario Strand\" for piano by Joyce Belyea was published for the Victoria College Music Club between 1946 and 1948 by the J.H. Peel Music Pub. Co. in Toronto.\nSites and architecture.\nVictoria University borders Queen's Park, northeast of the University of Toronto's main campus alongside St. Michael's College. The Victoria College Building, colloquially called \"Old Vic\", is an example of Richardsonian Romanesque architectural style, built in 1891. The architect was W. G. Storm, who died shortly after its completion. The campus is centred on the main quadrangle of Victoria, outlined by the Upper and Lower Houses of Burwash Hall.\nWest of the Lower Houses is the new Lester B. Pearson Garden of Peace and International Understanding and the E.J. Pratt Library beyond it. From the eastern side of the building, the Upper Houses look out at Rowell Jackman Hall and the Lower Houses see the St. Michael's College residence of Elmsley. The only exceptions are the view from Gate House's tower that looks down St. Mary's Street and the view from the south side of Bowles-Gandier house, which looks upon the main quadrangle of the University of St. Michael's College.\nE.J. Pratt Library.\nE.J. Pratt Library is the main library of Victoria University. It was built in 1961 and is located at the south end of the quadrangle. The site of the library and the adjacent Northrop Frye Building was originally on the route of Queen's Park Crescent. The road was pushed south into Queen's Park to make way for the new buildings.\nResidences.\nVictoria College is well-known for its historic residence buildings and tight-knit residence community.\nOrganization.\nVictoria University is governed bicamerally by the Victoria University Board of Regents and the Victoria University Senate. These bodies are represented by faculty, administrators, elected students and alumni. The colleges are governed by the Victoria College Council and Emmanuel College Council. College councils are represented by faculty, administrators and elected and appointed students. Victoria's governing charter was most recently amended in 1981, with the enactment of the Victoria University Act.\nVictoria is presently the wealthiest college at the University of Toronto by net assets. In part this has been because of alumni donations, but much of the growth is specifically due to the rapidly increasing value of Victoria's large real estate holdings in downtown Toronto.\nThe E.J. Pratt Library is the main library in the Victoria University Library system, which operates under the wider University of Toronto Libraries system. The collection of approximately 250,000 volumes is geared towards the undergraduate programs at Vic and contains mainly humanities texts with a focus on History, English, Philosophy. The library also hosts rich archival special collections from notable alumni and faculty, historical figures, specific literary collections and Canadiana. The library also oversees Victoria University's institutional archives.\nThe Centre for Renaissance and Reformation Studies and its respective library collection are located within the E.J. Pratt Library. Its holdings fall into three main categories: rare books, most of which were printed before 1700 (currently about 4,000 titles), modern books and microforms (several thousand microfiches and reels). The library contains primary and secondary materials relating to virtually every aspect of the Renaissance and Reformation. In particular, it houses the Erasmus collection, one of the richest resources in North America for the study of works written or edited by the great Dutch humanist Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam. The collection holds a substantial number of pre-1700 editions of his works, including the \"Novum Instrumentum\" of 1516.\nEmmanuel College Library is the theological library of the Victoria University Library system, also operating under the wider University of Toronto Libraries system. The library is noted for its beauty and is a frequented spot by theological and undergraduate students alike, hosting a sizable theological collection specializing in spiritual care, worship, homiletics, biblical studies, and the Methodist tradition, among others. Special collections and rare books in Emmanuel's collection are held and can be viewed at E.J. Pratt Library.\nStudent life.\nClubs and Levies.\nCampus life for Victoria students is active and varied. Victoria College has levy receivers, student organizations that directly receive a fixed amount of funding from students every year, as well as clubs whose funding are overseen by the Victoria University Students' Administrative Council (VUSAC). Prominent clubs include \"The Boundary\" (the college's satire paper), the Environmental Fashion Show, Vic Dance and the Victoria College Chorus.\nLevy receivers are students groups with special status based on providing an essential service for student life, and levy heads are also assessor members in VUSAC. Victoria's eleven levy receivers are:\nVictoria is also home to the Isabel Bader Theatre, opened in March 2001. During the past few years the theatre has been used as a lecture hall for University of Toronto students, an active learning space for Victoria University students groups, numerous concerts, film screenings, conferences, and theatrical productions, including the annual sophomore tradition launched in 1872, \"The Bob Comedy Revue\", each written, directed, produced and performed by students such as Lester B. Pearson, Norman Jewison, E. J. Pratt, Northrop Frye, and Margaret Atwood.\nAcademics.\nThe undergraduate academic programs of Victoria College include Literary Studies, Semiotics and Communication Theory, Renaissance Studies, and the Vic Concurrent Teacher Education Program (developed in conjunction with the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education). Other academic offerings of note include the first-year undergraduate programs Vic One and Vic First Pathways.\nThe Vic One program, launched in 2003, is an academic opportunity for first-year students at the University of Toronto to build communication and leadership skills in a small classroom setting. Applications typically open in December for any student who is applying to the University for enrolment in the following September. The Vic One program supplements a student's primary program of study in the form of weekly small group seminars and guest lectures from professors, visiting artists, writers, ambassadors and other public figures. Enrolment in each academic stream is limited to 25 students, with a maximum of 250 students in the program each year. The eight streams are:\nThe Centre for Renaissance and Reformation Studies (CRRS) is a research and teaching centre in Victoria University devoted to the study of the period from approximately 1350 to 1700. The CRRS supervises an undergraduate program in Renaissance Studies, organizes lectures and seminars, and maintains an active series of publications. The centre also offers undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral fellowships. From 1976 to 2009, the performance history research and publishing project Records of Early English Drama (REED) was based at Victoria University.\nThrough Emmanuel College, Victoria University also offers theological postgraduate options in the ecumenical tradition of the United Church of Canada, which are developed in close conjunction with the wider Toronto School of Theology. The most popular offering at Emmanuel is the Master of Divinity, which is undertaken by prospective ordinands to ministry of Word and Sacrament. Other offerings at Emmanuel include master's degrees in pastoral studies, sacred music, general theological studies, and more. Doctoral study in theological studies is also offered.\nBoard of Regents.\nThe Board of Regents is the governing body of Victoria University. The Board appoints the Chancellor, the President, the College Principals, the officers of the University, and appoints and promotes the teaching staff of Victoria and Emmanuel Colleges.\nThe 37 members of the Board of Regents include students (6), faculty (8), Victoria College alumni (1), Emmanuel College alumni (2), United Church appointees (13), ex-officio (4) and discretionary (3).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a dual-sector university, providing courses in both higher education and technical and further education (TAFE).\nThe university has several campuses in Melbourne Central Business District, Melbourne Western Region, Sydney, Brisbane, as well as Online.\nHistory.\nThe idea for a technical school based in the western suburbs of Melbourne was first proposed in 1910. The Footscray Technical School opened its doors to 220 students and 9 teachers in 1916 after five years of fundraising.\nCharles Archibald Hoadley was the school's principal from its founding until his death in 1947. Under Hoadley's leadership, the school expanded and began offering trade certificate courses, diplomas in architecture, building, and contracting, as well as evening classes. War and the Depression saw a dip in student numbers. However, by 1943, there were 2500 students enrolled in courses taught at the Footscray Park and Footscray Nicholson campuses.\nThe following decades saw gender and cultural shifts. In 1958, the school changed its name to the Footscray Technical College. Ten years later, it changed its name again, this time, to the Footscray Institute of Technology (FIT). Women first enrolled in day diploma courses in 1960, and changes to the federal government's immigration policy resulted in many more European and Asian students entering the school. The secondary school component, now known as Footscray City College, was separated from the rest of the institute in 1972. By the mid-1970s, the expanded curriculum included degree courses and was well beyond the technical focus of the original Footscray Technical School. Further changes occurred in the 1980s, with the technical and trade education section separating from FIT to form the Footscray and Newport Colleges of TAFE.\nIn 1990, FIT merged with the Western Institute, which had been founded three years earlier to provide TAFE and higher education courses to the outlying suburbs in western Melbourne. In 1990, it was established as a university by the Victoria State Parliament as Victoria University of Technology (VUT). The university further amalgamation with the Western Melbourne Institute of TAFE in 1998. In 2005, the Victoria University of Technology Act of 1990 was amended to rename the university as Victoria University, reflecting the development of its teaching and research.\nThe institutions that combined to form VU include:\nCampuses and buildings.\nVictoria University has campuses located throughout Melbourne's western region and the city centre. The new VU City Tower will be Melbourne's tallest vertical campus, and is due for completion in 2021. One campus is located in central Sydney.\nVU courses are also delivered by partner institutes throughout Asia, including in China, India, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka. Some of the university's largest partners are Sunway University College in Malaysia , NSBM Green University in Sri Lanka and Liaoning University in China.\nFootscray Park.\nFootscray Park Campus on Ballarat Road, Footscray is the university's main campus and administrative centre. It offers higher education courses primarily in engineering, education and sport-related disciplines. It occupies a site overlooking Flemington Racecourse and the Maribyrnong River. The A$68.5\u00a0million sport and learning precinct, including sport and exercise science research labs, was completed in early 2011. The campus also has a 25-metre swimming pool and a childcare centre.\nSt Albans.\nSt Albans Campus on McKenchie Street, St Albans, is the university's health and education hub, with a focus on psychology, nursing, arts, and paramedic and biomedical sciences. It is set on of native grasslands and sugar gums. The new St Albans Health and Fitness Centre was opened in 2013.\nFootscray Nicholson.\nFootscray Nicholson Campus is in central Footscray, on the corner of Nicholson and Buckley Streets. It delivers TAFE, VCE and short courses. Its new learning commons was opened in 2012 offering a broad range of educational and student services.\nCity.\nThe City Campus includes the VU City Tower and the law building at 295 Queen Street in the heart of Melbourne's legal precinct. The campus houses business courses, Osteopathy, a hair and beauty salon as well as the university's College of Law and Justice, a law library, the Sir Zelman Cowen Centre and two moot courts. It offers undergraduate and postgraduate law courses, including continuing legal education courses for legal professionals.\nWerribee.\nThe Werribee Campus is located in the Werribee agricultural research and tertiary education precinct. It offers trades training as well as facilities for water, food and fire safety research.\nSunshine.\nThe Sunshine Campus of Victoria Polytechnic is located on Ballarat Road, Sunshine. It offers TAFE courses, focusing mainly on business and the construction industries. The A$44\u00a0million high-technology Construction Hub was opened in 2013 for building and construction training. The campus also has a convention centre with a 200-seat auditorium.\nSydney.\nVictoria University delivers a number of business courses for international students at its campus in central Sydney, which operates in partnership with the Education Centre of Australia (ECA).\nWhitten Oval.\nIn late 2010, VU opened an A$8\u00a0million Sport and Recreation Learning Centre in partnership with the Western Bulldogs at the Whitten Oval in West Footscray. The Centre contains massage therapy clinics open to the public, as well as a 140-seat lecture theatre, a library, classrooms and offices.\nGovernance and structures.\nAcademic structure.\nSeveral of the university's colleges offer internationally recognised qualifications ranging from certificates and diplomas to degrees, postgraduate certificates and diplomas, and masters and doctoral research degrees (PhD). Victoria Polytechnic and VU College offer vocational education courses and higher education diplomas. These are divided between several colleges, including:\nAcademic profile.\nTuition, loans and financial aid.\nFor international students starting in 2025, tuition fees range from A$ to A$ per semester for higher education programs at the diploma level or above. Domestic students may be offered a federally-subsidised Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP) which substantially decreases the student contribution amount billed to the student. The maximum student contribution amount limits that can be applied to CSP students are dependent on the field of study.\nSince 2021, Commonwealth Supported Places have also been limited to 7 years of equivalent full-time study load (EFTSL), calculated in the form of Student Learning Entitlement (SLE). Students may accrue additional SLE under some circumstances (e.g. starting a \"separate\" one-year honours program) or every 10 years. Domestic students are also able to access the HECS-HELP student loans scheme offered by the federal government. These are indexed to the Consumer or Wage Price Index, whichever is lower, and repayments are voluntary unless the recipient passes an income threshold.\nThe university also offers several scholarships, which come in the form of bursaries or tuition fee remission.\nAcademic reputation.\nIn the \"Australian Financial Review\" Best Universities Ranking 2025, the university was tied #34 amongst Australian universities.\nIn the 2026 \"Quacquarelli Symonds\" World University Rankings (published 2025), the university attained a position of #741\u2013750 (32nd nationally).\nIn the \"Times Higher Education\" World University Rankings 2026 (published 2025), the university attained a position of #601\u2013600 (tied 33\u201335th nationally).\nIn the 2025\u20132026 \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" Best Global Universities, the university attained a tied position of #785 (28th nationally).\nIn the \"CWTS Leiden Ranking\" 2024, the university attained a position of #1030 (29th nationally).\nStudent outcomes.\nThe Australian Government's QILT conducts national surveys documenting the student life cycle from enrolment through to employment. These surveys place more emphasis on criteria such as student experience, graduate outcomes and employer satisfaction than perceived reputation, research output and citation counts.\nIn the 2023 Employer Satisfaction Survey, graduates of the university had an overall employer satisfaction rate of 85.5%.\nIn the 2023 Graduate Outcomes Survey, graduates of the university had a full-time employment rate of 64.5% for undergraduates and 84.9% for postgraduates. The initial full-time salary was A$ for undergraduates and A$ for postgraduates.\nIn the 2023 Student Experience Survey, undergraduates at the university rated the quality of their entire educational experience at 81.2% meanwhile postgraduates rated their overall education experience at 75.5%.\nResearch and publications.\n28 VU research disciplines were ranked at or above world standard in the Excellence in Research Australia (ERA) assessments 2018.\nStudent life.\nStudent demographics.\nIn 2019, VU had 43,802 students. Approximately 65% student in higher education degree programs, and 35% enrolled in TAFE training courses. Of these students, 5,662 were international students studying at one of VU's Melbourne or Sydney Campuses, and 3,772 were international students studying at VU programs overseas at one of its partner organisations located mainly in Asia.\nStudent accommodation.\nVU owns and operates student accommodation for students, staff, and guests of the university. In February 2016, the Student Village in Maidstone was replaced with the newly built UniLodge Victoria University, a 13-story apartment building across the road from the Footscray Park Campus on Ballarat Road, Footscray.\nInternational House, a traditional residential college located at the University of Melbourne, also offers places to Victoria University students.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was established in 1897 by an act of the New Zealand Parliament, and was a constituent college of the University of New Zealand.\nThe university is well known for its programmes in law, the humanities, and some scientific disciplines, and offers a broad range of other courses. Entry to all courses at first year is open, and entry to second year in some programmes (e.g. law, criminology, creative writing, architecture, engineering) is restricted.\nVictoria had the highest average research grade in the New Zealand Government's Performance Based Research Fund exercise in both 2012 and 2018, having been ranked 4th in 2006 and 3rd in 2003. Victoria has been ranked 215th in the World's Top 500 universities by the \"QS World University Rankings\" (2020).\nHistory.\nVictoria University of Wellington (originally known as Victoria University College) was founded in 1897, named after Queen Victoria, on the 60th anniversary of her coronation. The original name was Victoria University College, but following the dissolution of the University of New Zealand in 1961, it became Victoria University of Wellington and began conferring its own degrees.\nEarly history and colonial politics.\nIn 1868, the colonial government of New Zealand passed the University Endowment Act 1868, which established scholarship programs for study in the home islands of Great Britain, in addition to setting aside a land endowment in the burgeoning colony itself. The following year, with wealth generated from the Otago gold rush in addition to a strong foundation of the Scottish Enlightenment, the provincial government of Otago proceeded to lay the groundwork to establish the University of Otago. This was followed by the creation of Canterbury College, associated with the newly formed University of New Zealand. \nIn 1878, a royal commission was appointed to review the state of higher education in the country. It recommended the establishment of a federal system of four university colleges, established in Auckland and Wellington, in addition to the integration of the University of Otago and Canterbury College. The colonial government moved to provide sites, statutory grants and land endowments. This was somewhat delayed after the state of recession caused by the collapse of the City of Glasgow Bank in the same year, leading to a contraction in credit from Great Britain, and specifically London, the centre of global finance at the time. Nevertheless, in 1882, parliament passed the Auckland University College Act in 1882.\nThe growth of the population of Wellington, and the gradual improvement of the economy in the late 1880s were key factors in the final establishment of the college. A prominent advocate of creation was Robert Stout, Premier of New Zealand and later Chief Justice, as well as a member of the university senate. In June 1886, as Minister of Education, Stout signalled the governments intent of introducing a bill to establish a centre for higher learning in Wellington. Being the centre of the colonial government, Stout cited the opportunity for the college to be able to particularly specialise in law, political science, and history.\nStout further suggested that the staff of the New Zealand Colonial Museum could provide services in the fields of geology and natural history. This was indicated in the Wellington University College Bill of 1887, which meant the effective annexation of the museum. Colonial Museum director James Hector voiced considerable opposition to this bill. After a lengthy debate in parliament, this bill was promptly defeated.\nEstablishment.\nIn 1897, the current premier, Richard Seddon, who had until this point been unsupportive of the university project, returned from Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee celebrations in Great Britain with an honorary Law degree from the University of Cambridge. Seddon decided that the establishment of a college in Wellington would be a suitable way to mark the Queen's jubilee year.\nWhen introducing the Victoria College Bill in December 1897, Seddon stated:\n\"\u2018I do not think there will be any question as to the necessity for the establishment of a University College here in Wellington,\u2019\"\nThe college was to be governed by a 16-man council, with their inaugural meeting taking place on 23 May 1898.\nFounding professors.\nThe founding professors of Victoria College were:\nEarly days.\nWhile \"Victoria College\" had been legally founded with a grant, a council and a number of students, it had no physical property for the first decade of its existence. Early courses were held at Wellington Girls High School as well as the Technical School building on Victoria Street.\nThe professors set about creating a unique identity for the college. The somewhat fitting motto \"Sapientia magis auro desideranda\" was adopted in 1902. In 1903, the college adopted a badge and coat of arms featuring three crowns, the stars of the southern cross and the crest of the namesake of Wellington. It was at this time that the colours of the college were chosen; dark green and gold, taking inspiration of the colours of the nearby gorse covered Tinakori Hill.\nIn 1903 the council intended to establish a professorship in law, \u2018with a desire of to making the Law School at Wellington the most complete in the Colony\u2019, as soon as financially possible. The college appointed a fifth professor, in modern languages \u2013 selecting the Oxford educated Anglo-German George von Zedlitz. Zelditz was joined by a newly appointed New Zealand-educated biology professor Harry Borrer Kirk. \nKelburn campus.\nThe newly appointed Council in 1889 had considered the use of the 13-acre Alexandra Barracks site for a permanent campus. The site was widely supported in Wellington, but release of the land for academic purposes was stalled by the Seddon Government. In February 1901 an offer was made by a wealthy Wairarapa sheep farmer named Charles Pharazyn. Pharazyn offered to donate \u00a31000 if the college was built on a 6-acre plot of hilly land in Kelburn. Coincidentally, Pharazyn held a major financial interest in the then-under construction Kelburn \u2013 Karori Tramway (now known as the Wellington Cable Car). The Tramway was completed the following year, and to this day transports students from the central business area of Lambton Quay, to the university via Salamanca Station.\nConstruction began in 1902 with the regrading of the hillside. The construction of a main building followed shortly after, designed by local architects F. Penty and E.M. Blake in the Gothic Revival style. At the requests of Richard Seddon, the building gained a more imposing demeanour through the insistence of adding a third level. The then governor of New Zealand, Lord Plunket, laid the foundation stone on 27 August 1904.\nWhile opened on 30 March 1906, the building was not completed to its original design, but was progressively added to as the college grew. In the meantime, students had built tennis courts, as well as a wooden gymnasium and social hall being constructed. The building was named after Thomas Alexander Hunter, the well-regarded professor of mental science and political economy. Following the end of the First World War, north and south wings were added to the building, providing new teaching areas, recreational spaces, and a new library.\nDevelopment.\nAn extramural branch was founded at Palmerston North in 1960. It merged with Massey College on 1 January 1963. Having become a branch of Victoria upon the University of New Zealand's 1961 demise, the merged college became Massey University on 1 January 1964.\nVictoria has expanded beyond its original campus in Kelburn, with campuses in Te Aro (Faculty of Architecture and Design), and Pipitea (opposite Parliament, housing the Faculty of Law and Victoria Business School). Victoria also hosts the Ferrier Research Institute and the Robinson Research Institute in Lower Hutt, the Coastal Ecology Laboratory in Island Bay and the Miramar Creative Centre, in Park Rd, Miramar.\nIn 2015, Victoria opened a new campus in Auckland to service the growing demand for its courses and expertise.\nName-change proposal.\nIn May 2018 it was reported that Victoria was exploring options to simplify its name to the University of Wellington. Vice-chancellor Grant Guillford said that the university was pursuing a name change in order to reduce confusion overseas, as several other universities also carried the \"Victoria\" name. On 27 July 2018, the Victoria University of Wellington Council agreed in principle to the name change, as well as replacing the former M\u0101ori name \"Te Whare W\u0101nanga o Te Upoko o Te Ika a Maui\" with \"Te Herenga Waka,\" the name of the university's marae. Of the 2,000 public submissions on the name-change proposal, 75% strongly opposed it. Alumni and students strongly opposed the name change, staff gave mixed feedback, while Wellington's regional mayors and members of the university's advisory board favoured the name change.\nOn 24 September 2018 Victoria University's Council voted by a majority of nine to two to change the university's name to the University of Wellington. The council also voted to adopt the new M\u0101ori name of \"Te Herenga Waka\". The university's vice-chancellor Grant Guilford abstained from the vote, citing a conflict of interest. Critics such as Victoria University law professor Geoff McLay criticised the name change for erasing 120 years of history. By contrast, Chancellor Neil Paviour-Smith defended the outcome of the vote as \"one decision in a much broader strategy to try and help the university really achieve its potential\". The council would submit its recommendation to the Minister of Education to make the final decision.\nOn 18 December 2018 the minister for education, Chris Hipkins, announced that he had rejected the University Council's recommendation, stating that the proposed change did not have sufficient support from Victoria's staff, students or alumni, and that such a change would not be in keeping with institution accountability or be in the national interest. On 6 May 2019 Victoria University's Council announced that it would not contest the Education Minister's decision to reject its name-change proposal. The name change had received exceptionally strong opposition from faculty, alumni, students, and the Wellington City Council.\nThe university has, in recent years, distanced itself from the word 'Victoria', with many promotional materials referring solely to 'Wellington's University'. Many departments and initiatives have also been rebranded, for example \"Victoria Professional and Executive Development\" becoming \"Wellington Uni-Professional\". In January 2021, the university spent $69,000 on a new sign highlighting the word 'Wellington', which drew criticism from students and staff who said the funds could have been better spent elsewhere.\n2023 financial crisis.\nIn May 2023, Vice-chancellor Nic Smith confirmed that Victoria University was facing a NZ$33 million deficit due to declining student enrolments and a shortfall in government funding. The number of enrolments in 2023 dropped by 12.1% compared in 2022, accounting for 2,600 fewer students. In addition, the number of fulltime students declined from 17,000 in 2022 to 14,700 in 2023. To address this deficit, Smith proposed laying off between 230 and 260 staff members including 100 academics and 150 professional staff. On 27 June 2023, the New Zealand Government announced a NZ$128 million funding injection for New Zealand universities' degree and postgraduate-level programmes that would come into effect from 2024. In response to the announcement, Victoria University Tertiary Education Union branch president Dougal McNeill called on the university to shelve its planned staff cuts. Vice-chancellor Smith said that the funding injection would allow the university to save about a third of the 229 planned job cuts.\nIn October 2023 Victoria University issued a request for proposal to sell 24 properties, worth about $16 million, to recover their deficits. Of these properties, 11 were student flats, three of which were unoccupied.\nCampuses and facilities.\nVictoria University of Wellington has three campuses spread out over Wellington city. It also has premises in Auckland.\nAuckland.\nThe School of Business and Government offers selected courses at the Auckland premises, which is located in the Auckland CBD.\nOther facilities.\nThe Victoria University Coastal Ecology Laboratory supports research programmes in marine biology and coastal ecology on Wellington's rugged south coast.\nThe Miramar Creative Centre is located by the W\u0113t\u0101 Workshop buildings on Park Road, Miramar. The centre offers access to work experience and connections with New Zealand's film, animation and game design industries.\nLibrary.\nThe library was established in 1899. The collections are dispersed over four locations: Kelburn Library, Law Library, Architecture and Design Library and Commerce Library. The library also has a collection of digital resources and full text material online. In addition to electronic resources, printed books and journals, the Library also acquires works in microform, sound recordings, videos and other media consistent with the university's academic programme needs.\nThe library holds approximately 1.3\u00a0million printed volumes. It provides access to 70,000 print and electronic periodical titles and 200,000 e-books. It is an official Depository Library (DL-296) of the United Nations System (DEPOLIB), one of only three in the country. The J. C. Beaglehole Room is the official repository of all archival and manuscript material, and provides a supervised research service for Rare Books, for fine or fragile print items, and for 'last resort' copies of university publications.\nThe New Zealand Electronic Text Centre (NZETC) is a digital library of significant New Zealand and Pacific Island texts and materials, and is arranged according to the library of Congress classification system. The library has two online repositories: the ResearchArchive is its open research repository, which makes the university's research freely available online and the RestrictedArchive, which is the university's private research repository and is accessible only to Victoria University staff and students.\nBetween April 2003 and February 2010 the library was home to two locally famous residents, Tessa Brown and Sandy Rankine, a pair of library cats.\nCampus developments.\nTe Huanui and 320 The Terrace.\nIn September 2014, the university announced that it would purchase the abandoned Gordon Wilson Flats from Housing New Zealand. It was subsequently revealed that the purchase price was over NZ$6 million. The university bought the site due to its close proximity to the Kelburn campus, with the potential to create a link between Ghuznee St and the Terrace to the campus. \nIn July 2015, Urban Perspectives Limited, on behalf of Victoria University, lodged an application with Wellington City Council to rezone the area from \"Inner Residential Area\" to \"Institutional Precinct\", remove the Flats from the City District Plan's heritage list, and amend the Institutional Precinct provisions of the District Plan. Residents supported the removal of the flats from the area, as it was a significant case of urban decay in the area, while various groups, such as the Wellington Architectural Centre opposed the demolition of the flats, noting their architectural significance.\n\"The Gordon Wilson Flats have exceptional architectural significance. Not only are they associated with F. Gordon Wilson, one of the most prominent, powerful and influential architects in New Zealand from the 1930s through to the 1950s but they are the last of a line of highly important high rise social housing projects built by the state. They were initiated by the first Labour Government of 1935 and they reflect and have a direct connection with international modernism.\"\nThis issue bought up wider debate on whether it was worth retaining mid-century public housing for heritage purposes, when the building in question had itself paid scant value towards the past.\nIn April 2016, a Wellington City Council panel approved the rezoning of the flats, allowing Victoria University to demolish the building. However, in July 2016, the Architectural Centre lodged an appeal in the Environment Court against the Wellington City Council's decision to remove the Gordon Wilson flats' heritage status under Wellington's District Plan. The appeal was successful with the court determining that the heritage listing should stand in August 2017.\nIn 2018, Victoria University students Jessie Rogers and Hannah Rushton mapped the building using LIDAR mapping technology. This data was then used to create a computer generated model of the flats, allowing for them to be explored in a virtual reality environment. This virtual reality experience was them displayed at an exhibition named \"Immersive Legacies: 320 The Terrace, at the Wellington Museum, allowing for users to see information about the building, the building in its prime state, and the current deterioration of the structure.\"\nIn July 2020, Victoria University unveiled plans for what they called 'Te Huanui'. The plan showed that the university could be rezoning the site for institutional use, demolishing the Gordon Wilson Flats, while retaining the nearby McLeans Flats. The area would then be used to create a gateway between the hilltop Kelburn campus, and the city below, including an outdoor plaza and new teaching and research facilities. The development would also create a pedestrian and elevator link up to the Kelburn campus. \nNational Centre for Music.\nIn 2019, Victoria University, on behalf of the New Zealand School of Music, signed an agreement with Wellington City Council and the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra to establish a new National Music Centre based in Wellington Town Hall. This would be established once refurbishment work on the town hall had been completed.\nNg\u0101 Mokopuna.\nNg\u0101 Mokopuna (formally known as The Living P\u0101) was a redevelopment of the marae and surrounding area of the Kelburn campus. It involved the removal of five buildings from 42 to 50 Kelburn Parade and the creation of a new building employing principles based on the Living Building Challenge. Preparation work began in mid 2021, starting with the clearance and demolition of existing buildings on the construction site.\nThe building was opened in a ceremony late 2024, designed by Tennent Brown Architects, with art from David Hakaraia. Ng\u0101 Mokopuna is one of under 30 buildings certified as a living building by the International Living Future Institute.\nOrganisation and administration.\nFrom 1938 to 1957, the head of administration was the principal. Since 1957, the head of administration has been the vice-chancellor. The following people held the role of principal and/or vice-chancellor:\nGuilford retired on 4 March 2022. Professor Jennifer Windsor was named acting vice-chancellor. On 22 June 2022 Victoria University of Wellington announced that Guilford's replacement as vice-chancellor will be Professor Nic Smith, the current Provost at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT). Nic Smith's tenure as VUW vice-chancellor is due to start in January 2023. Professor Jennifer Windsor was named acting vice-chancellor. On 22 June 2022 Victoria University of Wellington announced that Guilford's replacement as vice-chancellor will be Professor Nic Smith, the current provost at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT). Nic Smith's tenure as VUW vice-chancellor is due to start in January 2023.\nDay-to-day governance is in the hands of the University Council, which consists of 20 people: four elected by the Court of Convocation, three elected by the academic staff, one elected by the general staff, two appointed by the student union executive, four appointed by the Minister of Education, four selected by the Council itself, and the vice-chancellor. The Court of Convocation is composed of all graduates who choose to participate. Charles Wilson, at the time the chief librarian of the parliamentary library, was a member of the original council and its chairman for two years.\nFor New Zealand residents entry to most courses is open, with a few exceptions. Performance Music requires an audition. There is selection for entry into the second year in degrees such as the LLB, BAS and BDes. BA in criminology and creative writing is also based on selection.\nIt owns the New Zealand School of Music.\nFaculties.\nA reorganisation of several university faculties was approved in October 2024. Since then,[ [update]] the faculties are:\nThe School of M\u0101ori Studies is unique in that since \u00a02024[ [update]] it does not belong to any faculty, but rather to Iho M\u0101ori under the portfolio of the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (M\u0101ori).\nFaculty of Law.\nThe Faculty of Law is located in the restored Old Government Buildings at the centre of the country's law-making precinct, in close proximity to Parliament, the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal, and the District and High courts. The faculty is rated 65th in the world in the 2021 QS World University Rankings and led New Zealand's law faculties for research in the most recent Performance-Based Research Fund Evaluation in 2006.\nResearch centres and institutes.\nVictoria has more than 40 research centres and institutes, including\nAcademic profile.\nAcademic reputation.\nIn the 2024 \"Aggregate Ranking of Top Universities\", which measures aggregate performance across the QS, THE and ARWU rankings, the university attained a position of #244 (3rd nationally).\nIn the 2026 \"Quacquarelli Symonds\" World University Rankings (published 2025), the university attained a tied position of #240 (4th nationally).\nIn the \"Times Higher Education\" World University Rankings 2026 (published 2025), the university attained a position of #401\u2013500 (tied 3-4th nationally).\nIn the 2025 \"Academic Ranking of World Universities\", the university attained a position of #401\u2013500 (tied 2-4th nationally).\nIn the 2025\u20132026 \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" Best Global Universities, the university attained a tied position of #506 (3rd nationally).\nIn the \"CWTS Leiden Ranking\" 2024, the university attained a position of #782 (5th nationally).\nControversies.\nIn 2010 there was criticism of Victoria University of Wellington for removing the Gender Studies department. In 2017, a minor in Gender Studies was made available.\nIn 2012 a Facebook page that is associated with Victoria University of Wellington students, \"Overheard @ Vic\", was in the media for the many rape comments that were made. These included comments like \"you've got to rape the paper, man, you can't let the paper rape you\" and \"at least ugly girls don't get raped\". In response to this, a spokesperson for Victoria University of Wellington said that \"student safety was a key focus, and the university had partnered with police and Wellington City Council to promote awareness of personal safety\".\nIn late 2015, academics and students at Victoria University of Wellington spoke out at the university hosting Israeli Defence Force troops for a public lecture. The opposition for this public lecture came about because of the soldiers' involvement in Operation Protective Edge, which is thought to have killed at least 2000 Palestinians, most of them civilians.\nIn July, 2016, a Victoria University of Wellington staff member Rebekah Proctor was jailed for two years and five months for defrauding the university out of $480,000 \u2013 as of 27 October Proctor has appealed her sentence. In October 2016 students protested the cut of several European languages, including the German language department losing 43% of staff. Also in 2016, Victoria University of Wellington was embroiled in a row with the Tertiary Education Union, when it was discovered that union members were being paid less than non-union members. This led the TEU to characterise the vice-chancellor Grant Guilford as being anti-union, and resulted in a one-day strike.\nIn April 2020, during the COVID-19 outbreak, the university came under fire from students, politicians, and media for suddenly announcing at 48 hours notice that they would be charging students a \"placeholder fee\" ($150 per week) for student accommodation that they had been forcibly removed from, despite emails from the university previously telling those same students that they would not have to pay.\nNotable academics and staff.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "32777", "revid": "26451247", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32777", "title": "Victor of Aveyron", "text": "Feral child found in 18th century France\nVictor of Aveyron (; c.\u20091788 \u2013 1828) was a French feral child who was found around the age of 9. Not only is he considered one of the most famous feral children, but his case is also the most documented case of a feral child. Upon his discovery, he was captured multiple times, running away from civilization approximately eight times. Eventually, his case was taken up by a physician, Jean Marc Gaspard Itard, who worked with the boy for five years and gave him his name \"Victor\". Itard was interested in determining what Victor could learn. He devised procedures to teach the boy words and recorded his progress. Based on his work with Victor, Itard broke new ground in the education of the developmentally delayed.\nEarly life.\nVictor was prepubescent when he was captured in 1800 but experienced puberty within a year or two. It is not known when or how he came to live in the woods near Saint-Sernin-sur-Rance, though he was reportedly seen there around 1794. In 1797, he was spotted by three hunters; he ran from them, but they were able to catch him when he tried to climb a tree. They brought him to a nearby town where he was cared for by a widow. However, he soon escaped and returned to the woods; he was periodically spotted in 1798 and 1799. On 8 January 1800, he emerged from the forests on his own. His age was unknown, but citizens of the village estimated his age to be about 12. His lack of speech, as well as his food preferences and the numerous scars on his body, suggested to some that he had been in the wild for most of his life.\nDiscovery.\nIn 1797, a child of around nine or ten years of age was sighted in Tarn. Two years later, he was caught by some men and dogs, escorted to the village of Lacaune, and taken in by a widow. He ate nothing except for raw vegetables or vegetables he cooked himself. He ran away after a week.\nIn the winter of 1799, he went from Tarn to Aveyron. On the 6th or 8th of January 1800, he was spotted naked, stooped and with tousled hair by three shoemakers, who took him out of the woods. He ran away, left the woods and was discovered a week later at a dyer's house in Saint-Sernin-sur-Rance. He did not speak and his movements were chaotic. According to the philosopher Fran\u00e7ois Dagognet, \"he walks on four legs, eats plants, is hairy, deaf and mute.\" He was sent to an orphanage at Saint-Affrique three days later, then to another at Rodez on 4 February. The psychiatrist Philippe Pinel, doctor at the Bic\u00eatre Hospital, wrote a report on Victor and considered him to be mentally ill and an idiot from birth (in that era, the term idiot was used to describe individuals with intellectual disabilities).\nStudy.\nShortly after Victor was found, a local abbot and biology professor, Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre, examined him. He removed the boy's clothing and led him outside into the snow, where, far from being upset, Victor began to frolic about in the nude, showing Bonnaterre that he was clearly accustomed to exposure and cold. The local government commissioner, Constans-Saint-Esteve, also observed the boy and wrote there was \"something extraordinary in his behavior, which makes him seem close to the state of wild animals\".\nThe boy was eventually taken to Rodez, where two men, who had each lost their sons during the French Revolution, travelled to find out whether he was their missing son. However, neither claimed the boy. There were other rumours regarding Victor's origins. For example, one rumour insisted that the boy was the illegitimate son of a \"notaire\" abandoned at a young age because he was mute. Itard believed Victor had \"lived in an absolute solitude from his fourth or fifth almost to his twelfth year, which is the age he may have been when he was taken in the Caune woods.\" That means he presumably lived for seven years in the wilderness.\nIt was clear that Victor could hear, but he was taken to the National Institute of the Deaf in Paris for the purpose of being studied by the renowned Roch-Ambroise Cucurron Sicard. Sicard and other members of the Society of Observers of Man believed that by studying, as well as educating the boy, they would gain the proof they needed for the recently popularized empiricist theory of knowledge. In the context of the Enlightenment, when many were debating what exactly distinguished human from animal, one of the most significant factors was the ability to learn language. By studying the boy, they would also be able to explain the relationship between humans and society.\nInfluence of the Enlightenment.\nThe Enlightenment caused many thinkers, including naturalists and philosophers, to believe human nature was a subject that needed to be redefined and looked at from a completely different angle. Because of the French Revolution and new developments in science and philosophy, humans were looked at not as special but as characteristic of their place in nature. It was hoped that by studying the wild boy, this idea would gain support. As such, Victor became a case study in the Enlightenment debate about the differences between humans and other animals.\nAt that time, the scientific category \"Juvenis averionensis\" was used, as a special case of the \"Homo ferus\", described by Carl Linnaeus in \"Systema Naturae\". Linnaeus and his discoveries, then, forced people to ask the question, \"What makes us [human]?\" Another developing idea prevalent during the Enlightenment was that of the noble savage. Some believed a person existing in the pure state of nature would be \"gentle, innocent, a lover of solitude, ignorant of evil and incapable of causing intentional harm.\"\nPhilosophies proposed by Rousseau, Locke and Descartes were evolving around the time the boy was discovered in France in 1800. These philosophies invariably influenced the way the boy was perceived by others, and eventually, how Itard would structure his education.\nEducation and later life.\nIt was said that even though he had been exposed to society and education, Victor had made little progress at the institution under Sicard. Many people questioned his ability to learn because of his initial state, and as Yousef explains, \"it is one thing to say that the [person] of nature is not yet fully human; it is quite another thing to say that the [person] of nature cannot become fully human.\" After Sicard became frustrated with the lack of progress made by the boy, he was left to roam the institution by himself, until Itard decided to take the boy into his home to keep reports and monitor his development.\nJean Marc Gaspard Itard.\nJean Marc Gaspard Itard, a young medical student, effectively adopted Victor into his home and published reports on his progress. Itard believed two things separated humans from animals: empathy and language. He wanted to civilize Victor with the objectives of teaching him to speak and to communicate human emotion. Victor showed significant early progress in understanding language and reading simple words, but failed to progress beyond a rudimentary level. Itard wrote, \"Under these circumstances his ear was not an organ for the appreciation of sounds, their articulations and their combinations; it was nothing but a simple means of self-preservation which warned of the approach of a dangerous animal or the fall of wild fruit.\"\nThe only two phrases Victor ever actually learned to spell out were \"lait\" ('milk') and \"Oh, Dieu\" ('Oh, God'). It would seem, however, that Itard implemented more contemporary views when he was educating Victor. Rousseau appears to have believed \"that natural association is based on reciprocally free and equal respect between people.\" This notion of how to educate and to teach was something that, although it did not produce the effects hoped for, did prove to be a step towards new systems of pedagogy. By attempting to learn about the boy who lived in nature, education could be restructured and characterized.\nItard has been recognized as the founder of \"oral education of the deaf; the field of otolaryngology; the use of behavior modification with severely impaired children; and special education for the mentally and physically handicapped.\"\nWhile Victor did not learn to speak the language that Itard tried to teach him, it seems that Victor did make progress in his behavior towards other people. At the Itard home, housekeeper Madame Gu\u00e9rin was setting the table one evening while crying over the loss of her husband. Victor stopped what he was doing and displayed consoling behavior towards her. Itard reported on this progress.\nLanguage.\nWhen looking at the association between language and intellect, French society considered one with the other. Unless cared for by friends or family, the mute routinely ended up in horrible, ghastly conditions. However, around 1750, a French priest, Charles-Michel de l'\u00c9p\u00e9e, created the Institut National de Jeunes Sourds de Paris\nto educate the deaf and mute. His institution was made into a National Institute in 1790. This new interest and moral obligation towards the deaf and mute inspired Itard to nurture and attempt to teach Victor language. \"He had Locke's and Condillac's theory that we are born with empty heads and that our ideas arise from what we perceive and experience. Having experienced almost nothing of society, the boy remained a savage.\"\nThroughout the years Itard spent working with Victor, he made some gradual progress. Victor understood the meaning of actions and used what 20th-century writer Roger Shattuck describes as \"action language,\" which Itard regarded as a kind of primitive form of communication. However, Itard still could not get Victor to speak. He wondered why Victor would choose to remain silent when he had already proved that he was not, in fact, deaf. Victor also did not understand tones of voice. Itard proclaimed \"Victor was the mental and psychological equivalent of someone born deaf and dumb. There would be little point in trying to teach him to speak by the normal means of repeating sounds if he didn't really hear them.\"\nShattuck critiques Itard's process of education, wondering why he never attempted to teach Victor to use sign language. Regardless, today there are certain hypotheses that Shattuck applies to Victor. \"One is that the Wild Boy, though born normal, developed a serious mental or psychological disturbance before his abandonment. Precocious schizophrenia, infantile psychosis, autism; a number of technical terms have been applied to his position. Several psychiatrists I have consulted favour this approach. It provides both a motivation for abandonment and an explanation for his partial recovery under Itard's treatment.\"\nVictor died of pneumonia in Paris in 1828 in the home of Madame Gu\u00e9rin.\nRecent commentary.\nProfessor Uta Frith has stated she believes Victor displayed signs of autism. Serge Aroles, in his book \"L'\u00e9nigme des enfants-loups\" (\"The Mystery of the Wolf-Children\"), also believes that surviving accounts of his behavior point to \"a moderate degree of autism\" (\"autisme moder\u00e9\") in Victor's case. Aroles notes that Victor showed characteristic signs of mental derangement, like grinding of the teeth, incessant rocking back and forth, and sudden, spasmodic movements.\nIn March 2008, following the disclosure that Misha Defonseca's best-selling book, later turned into film \"Survivre avec les loups\" ('Survival with the Wolves'), was a hoax, there was a debate in the French media (newspapers, radio, and television) concerning the numerous uncritically believed false cases of feral children. Although there are numerous books on this subject, almost none of them have been based on archives, with the authors using rather dubious second- or third-hand, printed information. According to French surgeon Serge Aroles, author of a general study of the phenomenon of feral children based on archives, almost all of these cases are fakes. In his judgment, Victor of Aveyron was not a genuine feral child; in Aroles' view, the scars on his body were not the consequences of a wild life in the forests, but rather of physical abuse at the hands of his parents or whoever initially raised him. Humans need to be nurtured at least until the age of 5 or 6; it is inconceivable that any child, including Victor, could survive on his own, in the wild, younger than that. This disability could also explain why he was abused, perhaps treated like an animal, in his earliest years. Bettelheim (1959) makes a case for this being a general pattern in the lives of so-called feral children.\nDramatizations and fictionalizations.\nVictor's life has been dramatized or fictionalized in a number of works:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Although based on pre-.NET Visual Basic, which is no longer supported or updated by Microsoft (except under Microsoft's \"It Just Works\" support which is for the full lifetime of supported Windows versions, including Windows 10 and Windows 11), the VBA implementation in Office continues to be updated to support new Office features. VBA is used for professional and end-user development due to its perceived ease-of-use, Office's vast installed userbase, and extensive legacy in business.\nVisual Basic for Applications enables building user-defined functions (UDFs), automating processes and accessing Windows API and other low-level functionality through dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). It supersedes and expands on the abilities of earlier application-specific macro programming languages such as Word's WordBASIC. It can be used to control many aspects of the host application, including manipulating user interface features, such as menus and toolbars, and working with custom user forms or dialog boxes.\nAs its name suggests, VBA is closely related to Visual Basic and uses the Visual Basic Runtime Library. However, VBA code normally can only run within a host application, rather than as a standalone program. VBA can, however, control one application from another using OLE Automation. For example, VBA can automatically create a Microsoft Word report from Microsoft Excel data that Excel collects automatically from polled sensors. VBA can use, but not create, ActiveX/COM DLLs, and later versions add support for class modules.\nVBA is built into most Microsoft Office applications, including Office for Mac OS X (except version 2008), and other Microsoft applications, including Microsoft MapPoint and Microsoft Visio. VBA is also implemented, at least partially, in applications published by companies other than Microsoft, including ArcGIS, AutoCAD, Collabora Online, CorelDraw, Kingsoft Office, LibreOffice, SolidWorks, WordPerfect, and UNICOM System Architect (which supports VBA 7.1).\nOrigins.\nWhen personal computers were initially released in the 1970s and 1980s, they typically included a version of BASIC so that customers could write their own programs. Microsoft's first products were BASIC compilers and interpreters, and the company distributed versions of BASIC with MS-DOS (versions 1.0 through 6.0) and developed follow-on products that offered more features and capabilities (QuickBASIC and BASIC Professional Development System).\nIn 1989, Bill Gates sketched out Microsoft's plans to use BASIC as a universal language to embellish or alter the performance of a range of software applications on microcomputers. He also revealed that the installed base of active BASIC programmers was four million users, and that BASIC was used three times more frequently than any other language on PCs. \nWhen Visual Basic was released in 1991, it seemed logical to use Visual Basic as the universal programming language for Windows applications. Until that time, each Microsoft application had its own macro language or automation technique, and the tools were largely incompatible. The first Microsoft application to debut VBA was Microsoft Excel 5.0 in 1993, based on Microsoft Visual Basic 3.0. This spurred the development of numerous custom business applications, and the decision was made to release VBA in a range of products.\nWindows users learned about the changes through user groups, books, and magazines. Early computer books that introduced VBA programming skills include Reed Jacobsen's \"Microsoft Excel Visual Basic for Windows 95 Step by Step\" (Microsoft Press, 1995) and Michael Halvorson and Chris Kinata's \"Microsoft Word 97 Visual Basic Step by Step\" (Microsoft Press, 1997).\nDesign.\nCode written in VBA is compiled to Microsoft P-Code (pseudo-code), a proprietary intermediate language, which the host applications (Access, Excel, Word, Outlook, and PowerPoint) store as a separate stream in COM Structured Storage files (e.g., codice_1 or codice_2) independent of the document streams. The intermediate code is then executed by a virtual machine (hosted by the host application). Compatibility ends with Visual Basic version 6; VBA is incompatible with Visual Basic .NET (VB.NET). VBA is proprietary to Microsoft and, apart from the COM interface, is not an open standard.\nAutomation.\nInteraction with the host application uses OLE Automation. Typically, the host application provides a type library and application programming interface (API) documentation which document how VBA programs can interact with the application. This documentation can be examined from inside the VBA development environment using its Object Browser.\nVisual Basic for Applications programs which are written to use the OLE Automation interface of one application cannot be used to automate a different application, even if that application hosts the Visual Basic runtime, because the OLE Automation interfaces will be different. For example, a VBA program written to automate Microsoft Word cannot be used with a different word processor, even if that word processor hosts VBA.\nConversely, multiple applications can be automated from the one host by creating Application objects within the VBA code. References to the different libraries must be created within the VBA client before any of the methods, objects, etc. become available to use in the application. This is achieved through what is referred to as Early or Late Binding. These application objects create the OLE link to the application when they are first created. Commands to the different applications must be done explicitly through these application objects in order to work correctly.\nAs an example, VBA code written in Microsoft Access can establish references to the Excel, Word and Outlook libraries; this allows creating an application that \u2013 for instance \u2013 runs a query in Access, exports the results to Excel and analyzes them, and then formats the output as tables in a Word document or sends them as an Outlook email.\nVBA programs can be attached to a menu button, a macro, a keyboard shortcut, or an OLE/COM event, such as the opening of a document in the application. The language provides a user interface in the form of UserForms, which can host ActiveX controls for added functionality.\nInter-process communication automation includes the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) and RealTimeData (RTD) which allows calling a Component Object Model (COM) automation server for dynamic or realtime financial or scientific data.\nSecurity concerns.\nAs with any common programming language, VBA macros can be created with malicious intent. Using VBA, most of the security features lie in the hands of the user, not the author. The VBA host application options are accessible to the user. The user who runs any document containing VBA macros can preset the software with user preferences. End-users can protect themselves from attack by disabling macros from running in an application or by granting permission for a document to run VBA code only if they are sure that the source of the document can be trusted.\nIn February 2022, Microsoft announced its plan to block VBA macros in files downloaded from the Internet by default in a variety of Office apps due to their widespread use to spread malware.\nMacro risks.\nA risk with using VBA macros, such as in Microsoft Office applications, is exposure to viruses. Risks stem from factors including ease of writing macros which decreases the skill required the write a malicious macro and that typical document sharing practices allow for a virus to spread quickly.\nA system macro \u2013 one that provides a core operation \u2013 can be redefined. This allows for significant flexibility, but also is a risk that hackers can exploit to access the document and its host computer without the user's knowledge or consent. For example, a hacker could replace the built-in core functionality macros such as AutoExec, AutoNew, AutoClose, AutoOpen, AutoExit with malicious versions. A malicious macro could be configured to run when the user presses a common keyboard shortcut such as which is normally for bold font.\nA type of macro virus that cuts and pastes the text of a document in the macro. The macro could be invoked with the Auto-open macro so that the text would be re-created when the document (empty) is opened. The user will not notice that the document is empty. The macro could also convert only some parts of the text in order to be less noticeable. Removing macros from the document manually or by using an anti-virus program could lead to a loss of content in the document.\n\"Polymorphic viruses change their code in fundamental ways with each replication in order to avoid detection by anti-virus scanners.\"\nIn WordBasic (first name of the language Visual Basic), polymorphic viruses are difficult to do.\nIndeed, the macro's polymorphism relies of the encryption of the document. However, the hackers have no control of the encryption key.\nFurthermore, the encryption is inefficient: the encrypted macros are just in the document, so the encryption key is too and when a polymorphic macro replicates itself, the key does not change (the replication affects only the macro not the encryption).\nIn addition to these difficulties, a macro can not modify itself, but another macro can. WordBasic is a powerful language, it allows some operations to the macros:\nSo, in order to implement macros viruses which can change its contents, hackers have to create another macro which fulfills the task to modify the content of the virus. However, this type of macro viruses is not widespread. Indeed, hackers frequently choose to do macro viruses because they are easy and quick to implement. Making a polymorphic macro requires a lot of knowledge of the WordBasic language (it needs the advanced functionalities) and more time than a \"classic\" macro virus. Even if a hacker were to make a polymorphic macro, the polymorphism needs to be done, so, the document needs to update and the update can be visible to a user.\nDuring replication, a macro can create do-nothing macros. But this idea can be combined with polymorphic macros, so macros are not necessarily do-nothing; each macro invokes the next one, so they can be arranged in a chain. In such a case, if they are not all removed during a disinfection, some destructive payload is activated. Such an attack can crash the winword processor with an internal error. Since Winword 6.0, the number of macros per template is limited to 150, so the attack is limited, too, but can still be very annoying.\nMacro viruses can, in some cases, interact between themselves. If two viruses are executed at the same time, both of them can modify the source code of each other.\nSo, it results a new virus which can not be recognize by the anti-viruses software. But the result is totally random: the macro virus can be more infectious or less infectious, depending upon which part of the virus has been changed.\nHowever, when the 'mating' is unintentional, the resulting macro virus has more chances to be less infectious.\nIndeed, in order to replicate itself, it has to know the commands in the source code, but, if it is changed with a random scheme, the macro can not replicate itself.\nNevertheless, it is possible to do such macros intentionally (it is different from polymorphic macros viruses which must use another macro to change their contents) in order to increase the infectivity of the two viruses.\nIn the example of the article, the macro virus \"Colors\" infected a document, but another infected the user's system before : the macro virus \"Concept\".\nBoth of these viruses use the command \"AutoOpen\", so, at first, the macro virus \"Colors\" was detected but the command \"AutoOpen\" in it was the command of the macro virus \"Concept\".\nMoreover, when \"Concept\" duplicates itself, it is unencrypted, but the command in the virus \"Colors\" was encrypted (Colors encrypt its commands).\nSo, replication of the macro virus \"Concept\" results in the hybridation of this macro virus (which had infected the user's system first) and \"Colors\".\nThe \"hybrid\" could replicate itself only if \"AutoOpen\" were not executed; indeed this command comes from \"Concept\", but the body of the hybrid is \"Colors\", so that create some conflicts.\nThis example shows the potential of mating macro viruses: if a couple of mating macro viruses is created, it will make it more difficult to detect both macro viruses (in this hypothesis, there are only two viruses which mate) by the virus-specific scanners and may reinforce the virility of the viruses.\nFortunately, this type of macro virus is rare (more than the polymorphic macro viruses, one may not even exist), indeed, creating two (or more) which can interact with each other and not reduce the virility (rather reinforce it) is complicated.\nAmong the worst scenarios in the world of viruses would be a tool allowing one to create a new virus by modifying an existing one.\nFor executable files, it is hard to create this kind of tool. But it is very simple for macro viruses since sources of macros are always available. Based on the same idea of polymorphic macros, a macro can perform modifications to all macros present in the document. Considering this, there are just a few modifications to make to the macro in order to convert it in a macro virus mutator.\nSo it is easy to create macro virus generators, and thereby to create quickly several thousands of known viruses.\nMost macros viruses are stand-alone; they do not depend on other macros (for the infectious part of the virus, not for the replication for some viruses), but some macros viruses do. They are called parasitic macros.\nWhen launched, they check other macros (viruses or not), and append their contents to them. In this way, all of the macros became viruses.\nBut, this type of macro can not be spread as quickly as stand-alone macros.\nIndeed, it depends on other macros, so, without them, the virus can not be spread. So, parasitic macros often are hybrid: they are stand alone and they can infect other macros.\nThis kind of macro virus poses real problems to the virus-specific anti-virus; in fact, they change the content of other viruses, so that accurate detection is not possible.\nSuboptimal anti-virus.\nThere are different types of anti-virus (or scanners), one is the heuristic analysis anti-virus which interprets or emulates macros.\nIndeed, to examine all branches of macros require a NP-complete complexity (using backtracking), so in this case, the analysis of one document (which contains macros) would take too much time. Interpreting or emulating a macro would lead to either false positive errors or in macro viruses not detected.\nAnother type of anti-virus, the integrity checker anti-virus, in some cases, does not work: it only checks documents with extensions DOT or DOC (indeed, some anti-virus producers suggest to their users), but Word documents can reside in others extensions than those two, and the content of the document tends to change often. So, like the heuristic analysis, this can lead to false positives errors, due to the fact that this type of anti-virus checks the whole document.\nThe last type of anti-virus seen will be the virus-specific scanner. It searches the signature of viruses, so, the type of anti-virus is weaker than the previous ones.\nIndeed, the viruses detected by virus-specific scanners are just the ones known by the software producers (so, more updates are needed than in other types of scanners). Moreover, this type of anti-virus is weak against morphing viruses (cf.section above). If a macro virus change its content (so, its signature), it cannot be detected any more by the virus-specific scanners, even if it is the same virus doing the same actions. Its signature does not match the one declared in the virus scanner.\nAdditional to the responsibility of the anti-virus is the user's responsibility: if a potential macro virus is detected, the user can choose what to do with it: ignore it, quarantine it or destroy it, but the last option is the most dangerous.\nThe anti-virus can activate some destructive macro viruses which destroy some data when they are deleted by the anti-virus.\nSo, both virus scanners and users are responsible for the security and the integrity of the documents/computer.\nMoreover, even if the anti-virus is not optimal in the virus detection, most macro viruses are detected and the progression in virus detection improves but with creation of new macro viruses.\nDevelopment.\nAs of July 1, 2007, Microsoft no longer offers VBA distribution licenses to new customers. Microsoft intended to add .NET-based languages to the current version of VBA ever since the release of the .NET Framework, of which versions 1.0 and 1.1 included a scripting runtime technology named \"Script for the .NET Framework\". Visual Studio .NET 2002 and 2003 SDK contained a separate scripting IDE called \"Visual Studio for Applications\" (VSA) that supported VB.NET. One of its significant features was that the interfaces to the technology were available via Active Scripting (VBScript and JScript), allowing even .NET-unaware applications to be scripted via .NET languages. However, VSA was deprecated in version 2.0 of the .NET Framework, leaving no clear upgrade path for applications desiring Active Scripting support (although \"scripts\" can be created in C#, VBScript, and other .NET languages, which can be compiled and executed at run-time via libraries installed as part of the standard .NET runtime).\nMicrosoft dropped VBA support for Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac. VBA was restored in Microsoft Office for Mac 2011. Microsoft said that it has no plan to remove VBA from the Windows version of Office.\nWith Office 2010, Microsoft introduced VBA7, which contains a true pointer data type: LongPtr. This allows referencing 64-bit address space. The 64-bit install of Office 2010 does not support common controls of MSComCtl (TabStrip, Toolbar, StatusBar, ProgressBar, TreeView, ListViews, ImageList, Slider, ImageComboBox) or MSComCt2 (Animation, UpDown, MonthView, DateTimePicker, FlatScrollBar), so legacy 32-bit code ported to 64-bit VBA code that depends on these common controls will not function. This did not affect the 32-bit version Office 2010. Microsoft eventually released a 64-bit version of MSComCtl with the July 27th, 2017 update to Office 2016.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A. D. (; ), commonly referred to as Valencia CF or simply Valencia, is a Spanish professional football club based in Valencia, Spain, that currently plays in La Liga, the top tier of the Spanish league system. Valencia was founded in 1919 and has played its home games at the 49,430-seater Mestalla since its opening in 1923.\nValencia has won six La Liga titles, eight Copa del Rey titles, one Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, and one Copa Eva Duarte. In European competitions, they have won two Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, one UEFA Cup, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, two UEFA Super Cups, and one UEFA Intertoto Cup. They have also reached two consecutive UEFA Champions League finals (2000 and 2001). The IFFHS named World\u2019s Best Club to Valencia in 2004. Valencia were also members of the G-14 group of leading European football clubs and since its end has been part of the original members of the European Club Association.\nFive former members of the club have been inducted into the FIFA International Football Hall of Fame, a project dedicated to preserving the memory of important figures in football history. These include Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, Mario Alberto Kempes, Rom\u00e1rio, Jorge Valdano and Didier Deschamps. Valencia also has four personalities in the FIFA 100, its induction taking place in 2004 as part of the centenary celebrations of FIFA's creation. The \"ches\" club is the team with the most Zarra Trophy winners (5), the fourth in the Zamora Trophy (9) and fifth in the Pichichi Trophy (6) at the national level, at the international level it\u2019s the third Spanish team with the most FIFA World Player nominees (9) and the fourth in the Ballon d'Or (23), it has ten nominations for the Golden Boy Award, one for the 2019 Kopa Trophy with Lee Kang-in and one for the 2024 Yashin Trophy with Giorgi Mamardashvili. It has been included three times in the UEFA Team of the Year, with Santiago Ca\u00f1izares and Kily Gonz\u00e1lez in 2001 and David Villa in 2010, the last repeating in the FIFPro World XI in the same year.\nFour Valencia players were part of the Spanish national team that won the 2010 FIFA World Cup: David Villa, who won the Silver Boot as the second-highest scorer, tied with Thomas M\u00fcller on five goals and the Bronze Ball as the third best player in the final phase of the championship, Carlos Marchena, David Silva and Juan Mata. Seven of its members have managed to win Olympic Games medals throughout its history: David Albelda and Miguel \u00c1ngel Angulo, silver in Sydney 2000; Fabi\u00e1n Ayala, gold in Athens 2004; \u00c9ver Banega, gold in Beijing 2008; Carlos Soler, silver in Tokyo 2020; Cristhian Mosquera and Diego L\u00f3pez, gold in Paris 2024.\nOver the years, the club has achieved a global reputation for their prolific youth academy, or \"Acad\u00e8mia\". Products of their academy include world-class talents such as Miguel Tendillo, Ricardo Arias, Fernando G\u00f3mez, Andr\u00e9s Palop, Javier Farinos, Ra\u00fal Albiol, David Albelda, Vicente Rodr\u00edguez, Gaizka Mendieta and David Silva. Current stars of the game to have graduated in recent years include Isco, Jordi Alba, Paco Alc\u00e1cer, Juan Bernat, Jos\u00e9 Gay\u00e0, Carlos Soler, Ferran Torres, Lee Kang-in, Cristhian Mosquera, and Javi Guerra. \nHistorically one of the biggest clubs in the world in terms of number of associates (registered paying supporters), with around 50,000 season ticket holders at their peak, the club began to decline in the mid-2010s. Singaporean billionaire Peter Lim acquired the team in 2014.\nHistory.\nThe club was established on 5 March 1919 and officially approved on 18 March 1919, with Octavio Augusto Milego D\u00edaz as its first president; incidentally, the presidency was decided by a coin toss. The club played its first competitive match away from home on 21 May 1919 against Valencia Gimn\u00e1stico, and lost the match 1\u20130.\nValencia moved into the Mestalla Stadium in 1923, having played its home matches at the Algir\u00f3s ground since 7 December 1919. The first match at Mestalla pitted the home side against Castell\u00f3n Castalia and ended in a 0\u20130 draw. In another match the day after, Valencia won 1\u20130 against the same opposition. Valencia CF won the Regional Championship in 1923, and was eligible to play in the domestic Copa del Rey cup competition for the first time in its history.\n1940s: Emergence as a giant in Spanish football.\nThe Spanish Civil War halted the progress of the Valencia team until 1941, when it won the Copa del Rey, beating RCD Espanyol in the final. In the 1941\u201342 season, the club won its first Spanish La Liga championship title, although winning the Copa del Rey was more reputable than the championship at that time. The club maintained its consistency to capture the league title again in the 1943\u201344 season, as well as the 1946\u201347 league edition. They would conclude their decade of success by winning the 1949 Copa del Rey; this meant Valencia ended the decade with a record of three La Liga and two Copa del Rey titles. This success would help cement the club's name in Spanish football.\nIn the 1950s, Valencia failed to emulate the success of the previous decade, even though it grew as a club. A restructuring of Mestalla resulted in an increase in spectator capacity to 45,000, while the club had a number of Spanish and foreign stars. Players such as Spanish international Antonio Puchades and Dutch forward Faas Wilkes graced the pitch at Mestalla. In the 1952\u201353 season, the club finished as runners-up in La Liga, and in the following season, won the Copa del Rey, then known as the Copa del General\u00edsimo.\n1960s: European successes in the Fairs Cup.\nWhile managing average league form in the early 1960s, Valencia had its first European success in the form of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (the forerunner to the UEFA Cup), defeating Barcelona in the final of the 1961\u201362 edition. The following edition of the tournament pitted Valencia against Croatian club Dinamo Zagreb in the final, which the Spanish side also won. Valencia reached a third consecutive Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final in the following season, but this time were defeated 2\u20131 by fellow Spanish club Zaragoza.\n1970s to early 1980s: More domestic and European glory.\nFormer two-time European Footballer of the Year award winner Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano was hired as Valencia coach in 1970, and immediately inspired his new club to their fourth La Liga championship and first since 1947. This secured Valencia its first qualification for the prestigious European Cup, contested by the various European domestic champions. Valencia reached the third round of the 1971\u201372 competition before losing both legs to Hungarian champions \u00dajpesti D\u00f3zsa. In 1972 the club also finished runners-up both in La Liga and the domestic cup, losing to Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, respectively. The most notable players of the 1970s era include Austrian midfielder Kurt Jara, forward Johnny Rep of the Netherlands and Argentinian forward Mario Kempes, who was consecutively La Liga top scorer in 1976\u201377 and 1977\u201378. Valencia would go on to win the Copa del Rey again in the 1978\u201379 season, and also capture the European Cup Winners' Cup the next season, after beating English club Arsenal in the final, and the European Super Cup against Nottingham Forest thanks to the away goals rule, with Kempes spearheading their success in Europe.\nMid to late 1980s: Stagnation and relegation.\nIn 1982, the club appointed Miljan Miljani\u0107 as coach. After a disappointing season, Valencia was in 17th place and faced relegation with seven games left to play. Koldo Aguirre replaced Miljani\u0107 as coach, and Valencia barely avoided relegation that year, relying on favorable results from other teams to ensure their own survival. In the 1983\u201384 and 1984\u201385 seasons, the club was heavily in debt under the presidency of Vicente Tormo. The club finally hit rock bottom when it was relegated at the end of the 1985\u201386 season, and riven with internal problems such as unpaid player and staff wages, as well as poor morale. The club was relegated for the first time after 55 years in Spanish top-flight football.\nArturo Tuz\u00f3n was named the new club president, and he helped steer Valencia back to La Liga. Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano returned as coach in 1986 and Valencia won promotion again following the 1986\u201387 season. Di St\u00e9fano stayed on as coach until the 1987\u201388 season, when the team finished in 14th position in La Liga. Bulgarian forward Luboslav Penev joined the club in 1989, as Valencia aimed to consolidate their place in La Liga. In the 1988\u201389 La Liga season, Valencia finished third, which would signal their competitiveness going into the 1990s.\n1990s: Re-emergence.\nIn the 1989\u201390 La Liga season, Valencia finished as runners-up to Real Madrid, and thus qualified for the UEFA Cup.\nGuus Hiddink was appointed as head coach in the 1991\u201392 season, and the club finished fourth in the League and reached the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey. In 1992, Valencia officially became a Sporting Limited Company, and retained Hiddink as their coach until 1993.\nBrazilian coach Carlos Alberto Parreira, fresh from winning the 1994 FIFA World Cup with the Brazil national team, became manager at Mestalla in 1994. Parreira immediately signed Spanish goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, Russian forward Oleg Salenko, and Predrag Mijatovi\u0107, but failed to produce results expected of him. He was replaced by new coach Jos\u00e9 Manuel Rielo. The club's earlier successes continued to elude it, although it was not short of top coaching staff like Luis Aragon\u00e9s and Jorge Valdano, as well as foreign star forwards like Brazilian Rom\u00e1rio, Claudio L\u00f3pez, Ariel Ortega from Argentina, and Adrian Ilie from Romania. In the 1995\u201396 La Liga season, Valencia finished second to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, being unable to capture the title after a close fought race.\nValencia would struggle for the next two seasons, but the 1998\u201399 La Liga season would signal the start of one of the club's most successful periods in their history; they lifted their first trophy in nineteen years by winning the 1998\u201399 Copa del Rey under Claudio Ranieri, and also qualified for the UEFA Champions League.\n2000s: Valencia returns to the top of Spanish and European football.\nValencia started the 1999\u20132000 season by winning another title, beating Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup. Valencia finished third in the league, four points behind champions Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a, and level on points with second-placed Bar\u00e7a. The biggest success for the club, however, was in the Champions League; for the first time in its history, Valencia reached the European Cup final. However, in the final played in Paris on 24 May 2000, Real Madrid would beat Valencia 3\u20130.\nThe final would also be Claudio L\u00f3pez's farewell, as he had agreed to sign for Italian side Lazio; also leaving was Farin\u00f3s for Inter Milan and Gerard for Barcelona. The notable signings of that summer were John Carew, Rub\u00e9n Baraja, Roberto Ayala, Vicente Rodr\u00edguez, and Brazilian left-back F\u00e1bio Aur\u00e9lio. That season Valencia also bought Pablo Aimar in the winter transfer window. Baraja, Aimar, Vicente, and Ayala would soon become a staple of Valencia's dominance of the early 2000s in La Liga.\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Ca\u00f1izares\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Djukic\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Pellegrino\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Angloma\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Gerardo\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Farin\u00f3s\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Mendieta\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; K.

After the Christmas break, however, Valencia started to pay for the top demand that such a draining competition like the Champions League requires. After passing the two mini-league phases, H\u00e9ctor C\u00faper's team eliminated English sides Arsenal in the quarter-finals and Leeds United in the semi-finals, reaching the final for the second consecutive year. In the final match against Bayern Munich, played in Milan at the San Siro on 23 May, Gaizka Mendieta gave Valencia the lead by scoring from the penalty spot right at the start of the match. Goalkeeper Santiago Ca\u00f1izares then stopped a penalty from Mehmet Scholl, but Stefan Effenberg drew Bayern level after the break thanks to another penalty. After extra time, the match went to a penalty shoot-out, where a Mauricio Pellegrino miss gave Bayern Champions League glory and dealt Valencia a second-straight defeat in the final. Valencia went on to slip to fifth place in La Liga and out of the Champions League positions for the 2001\u201302 season. Going into the final league match, Valencia only needed a draw at the Camp Nou against Barcelona to seal Champions League qualification. However, \"Los Che\" lost to Barcelona 3\u20132, with a last minute goal completing a hat-trick from Rivaldo, resulting in Barcelona qualifying for the Champions League ahead of their side.\nValencia president D. Pedro Cort\u00e9s resigned for personal reasons and left the club in July, with the satisfaction of overseeing the club win the Copa del Rey and Spanish Super Cup, as well as reaching two successive Champions League finals. D. Jaime Ort\u00ed replaced Cort\u00e9s as president and expressed his intention of maintaining the good form that had made the club so admired on the European circuit. There were also some changes in the team and staff. Rafael Ben\u00edtez, after helping Tenerife to promotion, replaced H\u00e9ctor C\u00faper after the latter became the new coach at Inter in Italy. Among the playing squad, Gaizka Mendieta, Didier Deschamps, Luis Milla, and Zlatko Zahovi\u010d left, while Carlos Marchena, Mista, Curro Torres, Francisco Rufete, Gonzalo de los Santos, and Salva Ballesta all arrived.\nFrom 1999 up until the end of the 2004 season, Valencia had one of their most successful periods in the club's history. With a total of two La Liga titles, a UEFA Cup, a Copa del Rey, and a UEFA Super Cup in those six years, no less than five first class titles and two Champions League finals had been achieved.\nThat first match against fellow title rivals Real Madrid produced a significant and important victory. This was followed by a record of eleven consecutive wins, breaking their existing record set in the 1970\u201371 season, which was also the club's La Liga title win under Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano.\nAfter a defeat in A Coru\u00f1a against Deportivo on 9 December 2001, the team had to overcome Espanyol at the Estadi Ol\u00edmpic Llu\u00eds Companys to avoid further backsliding behind the league leaders. at half-time, Valencia were 2\u20130 down, but a comeback in the second half saw them win 3\u20132.\nIn the second part of the season, Ben\u00edtez's team suffered a temporary setback after losing 1\u20130 at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u to Real Madrid, but in the coming six matches they recovered from this defeat and achieved four victories and two draws.\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Ca\u00f1izares\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Ayala\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Pellegrino\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Angloma\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Carboni\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Baraja\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; Mendieta\nem; top:-0.65em; width:10em; line-height:1.4em; white-space:nowrap\"&gt; K.

However, after a second half brace from Rub\u00e9n Baraja, they would achieve a 2\u20131 comeback win. Furthermore, Real Madrid's defeat at the Anoeta to Real Sociedad left Valencia with a three-point lead at the top of the table.\nValencia's final game of the season was on 5 May 2002 at La Rosaleda against M\u00e1laga, a day that has gone down in Valencia's history. The team shut itself away in Benalm\u00e1dena, close to the scene of the game, in order to gain focus. An early goal from Roberto Ayala and another close to half-time from F\u00e1bio Aur\u00e9lio secured Valencia a fifth La Liga crown, 31 years after their last title win.\nThe 2002\u201303 season was a disappointing one for Valencia, as they failed in their attempt to retain the La Liga title and ended up outside of the Champions League spots in fifth, behind Celta Vigo. They were also knocked out in the quarter-finals of the Champions League by Inter Milan on away goals. The 2003\u201304 season saw Valencia trailing longtime leaders Real Madrid. In February, with 26 matches played, Madrid were eight points clear at the top of the table. However, their form severely declined in the late stage of the season, and consecutive losses in their last five games of the campaign allowed Valencia to overtake them and claim the title, their second in three seasons. The club also added the UEFA Cup to this success, defeating Marseille 2\u20130 in the final.\nIn the summer of 2004, manager Ben\u00edtez decided to depart Valencia, stating he had had problems with the club president; he would soon become head coach of Liverpool. He was replaced by former Valencia coach Claudio Ranieri, who had recently been sacked by Chelsea. Despite lifting the European Super Cup after defeating UEFA Champions League winners Porto, his second reign at the club was a disappointment; Valencia harboured realistic hopes of retaining their La Liga crown but, by February, found themselves in seventh place. Valencia had also been knocked out of the Champions League group phase, with Ranieri being sacked promptly in February. The 2004\u201305 season ended with Valencia outside of the UEFA Cup spots.\nIn the summer of 2005, Getafe coach Quique Flores was appointed as the new manager of Valencia and ended the season in third place, which in turn gained Valencia a place in the Champions League after a season away from the competition. The 2006\u201307 season was one with many difficulties; a campaign which started with realistic hopes of challenging for the title was disrupted with a huge list of injuries to key players, as well as internal arguments between Flores and new sporting director Amedeo Carboni. Valencia ended the season in fourth place and were knocked out of the Champions League in the quarter-finals by Chelsea 3\u20132 on aggregate, after they had knocked out Italian champions Inter in the second round. In the summer of 2007, the internal fight between Flores and Carboni was settled, with Carboni being replaced by \u00c1ngel Ruiz as the new sporting director of Valencia.\nOn 29 October 2007, the Valencia board of directors fired Flores after a string of disappointing performances, and caretaker manager \u00d3scar Fern\u00e1ndez took over on a temporary basis until a full-time manager was found, rumoured to be either Marcello Lippi or Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. A day later, Dutch manager Ronald Koeman announced he would be leaving PSV Eindhoven to sign for Valencia. However, Koeman's appointment failed to lead to improvement; in fact, Valencia even went on to drop to the 15th position in the league, just two points above the relegation zone. Despite their poor league form, Valencia would still go on to lift the Copa del Rey on 16 April 2008, following a 3\u20131 victory over Getafe at the Vicente Calder\u00f3n. This was the club's seventh Copa title. Five days later, one day after a devastating 5\u20131 league defeat in Bilbao, Valencia fired Koeman and replaced him with Voro, who would guide Valencia as caretaker manager for the remainder of the season. He went on to win the first match since the sacking of Koeman, beating Osasuna 3\u20130. Voro would eventually drag Valencia from the relegation battle to a safe mid-table finish of tenth place, finally ending a disastrous league campaign for \"Los Che\".\nHighly rated Unai Emery was announced as the new head coach of Valencia on 22 May 2008. The start of the young manager's career looked to be promising, with the club winning four out of its first five games, a surge that saw the team rise to the top position of the La Liga table. Despite looking impressive in Europe, \"Los Che\" then hit a poor run of form in the league that saw them dip as low as seventh in the standings. Amid the slump emerged reports of a massive internal debt at the club exceeding 400 million euros, as well as that the players had been unpaid for weeks. The team's problems were compounded when they were knocked out of the UEFA Cup by Dynamo Kyiv on away goals. After a run where Valencia took only five points from ten games in La Liga, an announcement was made that the club had secured a loan that would cover the players' expenses until the end of the year. This announcement coincided with an upturn in form, and the club won six of its next eight games to surge back into the critical fourth place Champions' League spot. However, \"Los Che\" were then pushed down to sixth place in the league following defeats to top four rivals Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Villarreal in two of their final three games, meaning they failed to qualify for the Champions League for a second successive season.\n2010\u20132014: Debt issues and stability.\nNo solution had yet been found to address the massive debt Valencia was faced with, and rumors persisted that top talents such as David Villa, Juan Mata, and David Silva could leave the club to help balance the books. In the first season of the new decade, Valencia returned to the Champions League for the first time since the 2007\u201308 campaign, as they finished comfortably in third place in the 2009\u201310 La Liga standings. However, in the summer of 2010, due to financial reasons, David Villa and David Silva were sold to Barcelona and Manchester City, respectively, to reduce the club's massive debt. Despite the loss of two of the club's most important players, the team was able to finish comfortably in third place again in the 2010\u201311 La Liga for the second season running, although they would be eliminated from the Champions League by German side Schalke 04 in the round of 16. In the summer of 2011, then-captain Juan Mata was sold to Chelsea to further help Valencia's precarious financial situation. It was announced by club president Manuel Llorente that the club's debt had been decreased and that the work on the new stadium would restart as soon as possible, sometime in 2012.\nDuring the 2012\u201313 season, Ernesto Valverde was announced as the new manager, but after failing to qualify for the Champions League, he stepped down and was replaced by Miroslav \u0110uki\u0107. On 5 July 2013, Amadeo Salvo was named as the new president of the club. Almost a month after Salvo was named president, on 1 August, Valencia sold star striker Roberto Soldado to English club Tottenham Hotspur for a reported fee of \u20ac30\u00a0million. \u0110uki\u0107 was sacked six months into the 2013\u201314 season after just six wins in his first sixteen matches, Valencia's worst start to a season in fifteen years. He was replaced by Juan Antonio Pizzi on 26 December 2013. Under Pizzi, Valencia reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Europa League, where they lost to eventual winners Sevilla on away goals, and finished eighth in La Liga despite a disastrous start to the season.\n2014\u2013present: Decline under Peter Lim's ownership.\nIn May 2014, Singaporean businessman Peter Lim was designated by the Fundaci\u00f3n Valencia CF as the buyer of 70.4% of the shares owned by the club's foundation. After months of negotiations between Lim and Bankia (the main creditor of the club), an agreement was reached in August 2014. Juan Antonio Pizzi was unexpectedly sacked as head coach and replaced by Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo on 2 July 2014. Later, Salvo revealed in an interview that hiring Nuno was one of the conditions Lim had insisted on when buying the club. This raised eyebrows in the media because of Nuno's close relationship with the football agent Jorge Mendes, whose first-ever client was Nuno. Lim and Mendes were also close friends and business partners. Regardless, Nuno's first season was a successful one. Notable signings included \u00c1lvaro Negredo, Andr\u00e9 Gomes and Enzo P\u00e9rez, who had just won the Player of the Year in the Portuguese Primeira Liga. Valencia finished the 2014\u201315 season in fourth place, achieving Champions League qualification with 77 points, just one point ahead of Sevilla after a dramatic final week where they defeated Granada 4\u20130.\nOn 2 July 2015, Amadeo Salvo resigned from his post as the executive president of Valencia, citing personal reasons. He was a popular figure among the fans. On 10 August 2015, Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi was sold to Manchester City for \u00a332\u00a0million and Aymen Abdennour was signed from Monaco for \u00a322\u00a0million as his replacement. Valencia defeated Monaco in the Champions League play-off round with a 4\u20133 aggregate victory. However, Valencia had a poor start to the 2015\u201316 league season, winning only five out of thirteen matches and failing to progress from the Champions League group stage. The fans were also increasingly concerned about the growing influence of Jorge Mendes in the club's activities. On 29 November, Nuno resigned as manager and former Manchester United defender Gary Neville was hired as his replacement on 2 December. Valencia went winless for nine matches before earning their first win under Neville in a 2\u20131 victory at home against Espanyol. On 30 March 2016, Neville was sacked after recording the lowest win percentage in La Liga history for a Valencia manager with minimum of five matches, winning just three out of sixteen games. He was replaced by Pako Ayestar\u00e1n, who had been brought in by Neville as the assistant coach just one month prior. Valencia finished the season in twelfth place.\nIn the summer of 2016, Andr\u00e9 Gomes and Paco Alc\u00e1cer were both sold to Barcelona and Shkodran Mustafi was sold to Arsenal, while Ezequiel Garay and former Manchester United player Nani were brought in. Pako Ayestar\u00e1n was sacked on 21 September 2016 after four straight defeats at the beginning of the 2016\u201317 season. Former Italy national team head coach Cesare Prandelli was hired as his replacement on 28 September. However, he resigned after just three months on 30 December, claiming the club had made him false transfer promises. Days later, on 7 January 2017, Valencia sporting director Jes\u00fas Garc\u00eda Pitarch also resigned, saying he felt like he was being used as a shield for criticism by the club and that he could not defend something he no longer believed in. Voro was named caretaker manager for the fifth time until the end of season, with Valencia in 17th position and in danger of relegation. However, results improved under Voro and he steered Valencia clear off relegation, ultimately finishing the season in 12th place. On 27 March, Mateu Alemany was named the new director general of Valencia.\nThe club also announced club president Lay Hoon Chan had submitted her resignation and that she would be replaced by Anil Murthy. After rumors arose of Lim's attempts at selling the club, Murthy assured the fans and local media that Valencia was a long-term project for both him and Lim, and they would not consider selling the club. For the following season, former Villarreal coach Marcelino was named the new manager on 12 May.\nAfter a successful first season under Marcelino, the club secured fourth place in La Liga and a return to the Champions League. In Marcelino's second season, Valencia again finished fourth and also reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Europa League. On 25 May 2019, Valencia won the Copa del Rey, their first trophy since 2008, upsetting league winners Barcelona 2\u20131 in the final.\nBoth Marcelino and sporting director Mateu Alemany, who were credited as the architects of this success, were fired on 11 September 2019 after the former publicly criticized Lim. He was replaced by the ultimately unsuccessful Albert Celades, who was sacked due to poor results, while sporting director C\u00e9sar S\u00e1nchez resigned that same season, making it six different managers and another six sporting directors by 2020.\nFor the 2020\u201321 season, manager Javi Gracia was hired. He was put in charge of a team full of prospects and reserves after the club failed to sign any players during the summer transfer window, but sold key players such as captain Dani Parejo. Local wonderkid Ferran Torres was also sold to Manchester City for a price deemed half his market value. Overall, Valencia sold players worth 85 million euros in order to rebalance the club's books. At the beginning of the season, the club was unable to pay the salaries to the remaining players. After six seasons under Peter Lim's ownership, Valencia had accumulated losses of 323 million euros, In the following years, the playing squad was cut significantly in terms of quality and Lim's ownership has faced strong criticism in Valencia.\nIn the 2021\u201322 season, Jos\u00e9 Bordal\u00e1s was hired as head coach, following his five-season tenure with Getafe. Valencia reached the Copa del Rey final final in Bordal\u00e1s' first season in charge, but lost to Real Betis on penalties following a 1\u20131 draw.\nIn June 2022, Anil Murthy left after reportedly insulting the club's owner. Peter Lim's sons became club directors and Lay Hoon Chan returned as the club President.\nStadium.\nValencia played its first years at the Algir\u00f3s stadium, but moved to the Mestalla in 1923. In the 1950s, the Mestalla was restructured, which resulted in a capacity increase to 45,000 spectators. Today it holds 49,430 seats, making it the fifth largest stadium in Spain. It is also renowned for its steep terracing and for being one of the most intimidating atmospheres in Europe.\nOn 20 May 1923, the Mestalla pitch was inaugurated with a friendly match between Valencia and Levante UD.\nA long history has taken place on the Mestalla field since its very beginning, when the Valencia team was not yet in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n. Back then, this stadium could hold 17,000 spectators, and at that time, the club started to show its potential in regional championships, which led the managers of the time to carry out the first alterations of Mestalla in 1927. The stadium's total capacity increased to 25,000 before it became severely damaged during the Civil War; the Mestalla was used as a concentration camp and a junk warehouse. It would only keep its structure, since the rest was a lonely plot of land with no terraces and a stand broken during the war. Once the Valencian pitch was renovated, the Mestalla stadium in which the team managed to bring home their first title in 1941.\nDuring the 1950s, the Valencia ground experienced the deepest change in its whole history. That project resulted in a stadium with a capacity of 45,500 spectators, that eventually saw destruction by a flood in October 1957 that arose from the overflowing of the Turia River. Nevertheless, the Mestalla not only returned to normality, but also some more improvements were added, like artificial light, which was inaugurated during the 1959 Fallas festivities.\nDuring the 1960s, the stadium kept the same appearance, while the urban view around it was quickly being transformed. Moreover, the ground held its first European matches, with Nottingham Forest being the first foreign team to play at the Mestalla, on 15 September 1961.\nFrom 1969, the expression \"Anem a Mestalla\" (\"Let's go to the Mestalla\"), so common among the supporters, began to fall into oblivion. The reason of this was due to a proposed name change of the stadium to honor Luis Casanova Giner, the club's most successful president. Giner admitted he was completely overwhelmed by such honour, but requested in 1994 that the original name of Mestalla remained.\nIn 1972, the head office of the club, located in the back of the numbered terraces, was inaugurated. It consisted of an office of avant-garde style with a trophy hall, which held the founding flag of the club. In the summer of 1973, more goal seats, which meant the elimination of fourteen rows of standing terraces, were added to provide comfort. Club management also considered the possibility of moving the Mestalla from its present location, to land on the outskirts of the town, before deciding against it.\nMestalla also hosted the Spain national football team for the first time in 1925. It was chosen as the national team's group venue when Spain staged the 1982 FIFA World Cup, and at the 1992 Summer Olympics held in Barcelona. All of Spain's matches up to the final were held at Mestalla, as they won Gold. Mestalla has been the setting for important international matches, has held several Cup finals, and has also been the home of Levante. The ground also provided a temporary home for Castell\u00f3n and Real Madrid for European games due to stadium development.\nNew stadium.\nThe 2008\u201309 season was due to be the last season at the Mestalla, with the club intending to move to their new 75,000-seater stadium Nou Mestalla in time for the 2009\u201310 season. However, due to the club being in financial crisis, work on the new stadium has been heavily delayed. On 10 January 2025, it was reported that construction for Nou Mestalla has resumed and is set to be completed prior to the 2027\u201328 season.\nClub identity.\nKit.\nOriginally, Valencia's kit was composed of white shirts, black shorts and socks of the same colour. Through the years, however, these colours have alternated between white and black. The away kit has been shades of orange in recent years while third alternate kits have featured colors from the club crest\u2014yellow, blood orange and blue.\nThe team have also attracted smaller, local sponsors over the years. One example is Lamiplast, a Valencia-based furniture company.\nAnthem.\nTo celebrate the club's 75th anniversary the then president Arturo Tuz\u00f3n commissioned Pablo S\u00e1nchez Torella to compose an anthem for the club. This was a \"pasodoble\" whose lyrics were later written by Ram\u00f3n Gimeno Gil in the Valencian language. The anthem had its official presentation on the anniversary of the club on 21 September 1993.\nCrest.\nValencia and the Balearic Islands were conquered by King James I of Aragon during the first half of the 13th century. After the conquest, the King gave them the status of independent kingdoms of whom he was also the king (but they were independent of Aragonese laws and institutions). The arms of Valencia show those of James I.\nThe unique crowned letters \"L\" besides the shield were granted by Peter IV. The reason for the letters was that the city had been loyal twice to the King, hence twice a letter \"L\" and a crown for the king.\nThere are several possible explanations for the bat; one is that bats are simply quite common in the area. The second theory is that on 9 October 1238, when James I was about to enter the city, re-conquering it from the Moors, a bat landed on the top of his flag, which he interpreted as a good omen. Following his victory, the bat were then added to the coat of arms.\nIn May 2013, it was reported that DC Comics had started a legal case against the club, claiming that the new bat image design was too similar to Batman. The club issued a statement clarifying that it had intended to use a revised version of its bat logo for a line of casual clothing and applied for permission from the Office of Harmonisation of the Internal Market but the application was dropped after DC Comics filed an \"objection\", not a lawsuit. DC Comics again filed a complaint with the EU's office of IP opposing the trademark application made by Valencia for its centennial logo, claiming there is likely to be confusion with its Batman\u2019s symbol.\n \"As of 2 September 2025\"\nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Football squad player/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReserve team.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Football squad player/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOut on loan.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Football squad player/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCoaching staff.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLast updated: 28 December 2024Source: https://\nNotable coaches.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLL. = La Liga; CdR = Copa del Rey; SC = Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a; UCL = UEFA Champions League; UCWC = UEFA Cup Winners' Cup; UEL = UEFA Europa League; UIC = UEFA Intertoto Cup; USC = UEFA Super Cup\nThe Academy: Training Centre Foundation Valencia CF.\nSince May 2009, Valencia CF has had a training centre, this is the first multidisciplinary training center for a football club in Spain.\nThe Training Centre Foundation Valencia CF \"The Academy\" offers university education, classroom training, and online training related to sport and football (soccer).\nValencia CF is one of the few clubs in Spain that organises a Sport Management MBA, the MBA in International Sport Management, currently performs with Valencia Catholic University Saint Vincent Martyr.\nOn the 90th anniversary of Valencia CF, the academy opened with the University of Valencia the first university course that studied the history of a football club, Valencia CF is the first football club in Spain to be an object of study in college.\nMotorsports involvement.\nValencia CF were also involved in motorsports such as Formula One, Super GT, MotoGP, Moto2, Moto3, 250cc and Formula Nippon. Valencia CF was an official partner of Panasonic Toyota Racing in 2003 until 2008 to commemorate Toyota as their shirt sponsor. Valencia CF also sponsored all Toyota-engined Formula Nippon teams and also Toyota Super GT teams in GT500 and GT300 cars. In 2009, Valencia CF became an official partner of former 250cc team Stop And Go Racing Team and in 2014 of Aspar Team in MotoGP, Moto2 and Moto3 classes, respectively.\nEsports involvement.\nIn June 2016, Valencia opened an esports division with presences in \"Hearthstone\", \"Rocket League\" and \"League of Legends\" \u2013 in the last case, they joined Be\u015fikta\u015f, Santos, Schalke and PSG in acquiring \"League\" teams.

They joined the local club Buriram United FC, and after that, French club Paris Saint-Germain FC in acquiring AoV teams.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "32781", "revid": "51032127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32781", "title": "Voyager 1", "text": "NASA space probe launched in 1977\nVoyager 1 is a space probe launched by NASA on September 5, 1977, as part of the Voyager program, to study the outer Solar System and the interstellar space beyond the Sun's heliosphere. It was launched 16 days after its twin, \"Voyager 2\". It communicates through the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) to receive routine commands and to transmit data to Earth. Real-time distance and velocity data are provided by NASA and JPL. At a distance of as of \u00a02025[ [update]], it is the most distant human-made object from Earth. \"Voyager 1\" is also projected to reach a distance of one light day from Earth in November of 2026. \nThe probe made flybys of Jupiter, Saturn, and Saturn's largest moon, Titan. NASA had a choice of either conducting a Pluto or Titan flyby. Exploration of Titan took priority because it was known to have a substantial atmosphere. \"Voyager 1\" studied the weather, magnetic fields, and rings of the two gas giants and was the first probe to provide detailed images of their moons.\nAs part of the Voyager program and like its sister craft \"Voyager 2\", the spacecraft's extended mission is to locate and study the regions and boundaries of the outer heliosphere and to begin exploring the interstellar medium. \"Voyager 1\" crossed the heliopause and entered interstellar space on August 25, 2012, making it the first spacecraft to do so. Two years later, \"Voyager 1\" began experiencing a third wave of coronal mass ejections from the Sun that continued to at least December 15, 2014, further confirming that the probe is in interstellar space.\nIn 2017, the Voyager team successfully fired the spacecraft's trajectory correction maneuver (TCM) thrusters for the first time since 1980, enabling the mission to be extended by two to three years. \n\"Voyager 1\" experienced two successful revivals of several thrusters: In 2018-2019 then in 2025. \n\"Voyager 1\"'s extended mission is expected to continue to return scientific data for several more years. Its radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) may supply enough electric power to return engineering data until 2036.\nMission background.\nA 1960s proposal for a Grand Tour to study the outer planets led NASA to begin work on a mission during the early 1970s. Initially, \"Voyager 1\" was planned as \"Mariner 11\" of the Mariner program. Due to budget cuts, the mission was reduced to a flyby of Jupiter and Saturn and renamed the Mariner Jupiter-Saturn probes. The name was changed to \"Voyager\" when the probe designs began to differ substantially from Mariner missions.\nSpacecraft components.\n\"Voyager 1\" was built by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). It has a bus shaped like a decagonal (ten-sided) prism. It has 16 hydrazine thrusters, three-axis stabilization gyroscopes, and referencing instruments to keep the probe's radio antenna pointed toward Earth. Collectively, these instruments are part of the Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS), along with redundant units of most instruments and eight backup thrusters. The spacecraft also included 11 scientific instruments to study celestial objects such as planets as it travels through space.\nCommunication system.\nThe radio communication system of \"Voyager 1\" was designed to be used up to and beyond the limits of the Solar System. It has a diameter high-gain Cassegrain antenna to send and receive radio waves via the three Deep Space Network stations on the Earth. The spacecraft normally transmits data to Earth over Deep Space Network Channel 18, using a frequency of either 2.3\u00a0GHz or 8.4\u00a0GHz, while signals from Earth to Voyager are transmitted at 2.1\u00a0GHz.\nWhen \"Voyager 1\" is unable to communicate with the Earth, its digital tape recorder (DTR) can record about 64 megabytes of data for later transmission. As of 2025[ [update]], signals from \"Voyager 1\" took more than 23 hours to reach Earth.\nPower.\n\"Voyager 1\" has three radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) mounted on a boom. Each MHW-RTG contains 24 pressed plutonium-238 PuO2 oxide spheres. The RTGs generated about 470 W of electric power at the time of launch, with the remainder being dissipated as waste heat. The power output of the RTGs declines over time due to the 87.7-year half-life of the fuel and degradation of the thermocouples, but they will continue to support some of its operations until at least 2025.\nComputers.\nUnlike \"Voyager's\" other instruments, the operation of the cameras for visible light is not autonomous, but is controlled by an imaging parameter table contained in one of the digital computers, the Flight Data Subsystem (FDS). Since the 1990s, most space probes have been equipped with completely autonomous cameras.\nThe computer command subsystem (CCS) controls the cameras. The CCS contains fixed computer programs, such as command decoding, fault-detection and fault-correction routines, antenna pointing routines, and spacecraft sequencing routines. This computer is an improved version of the one that was used in the 1970s Viking orbiters.\nThe Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS) controls the spacecraft orientation. It keeps the high-gain antenna pointing towards Earth, controls attitude changes, and points the scan platform. The custom-built AACS systems on both Voyagers are the same.\nMission profile.\nLaunch and trajectory.\nThe \"Voyager 1\" probe was launched on September 5, 1977, from Launch Complex 41 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, aboard a Titan IIIE launch vehicle. The \"Voyager 2\" probe had been launched two weeks earlier, on August 20, 1977. Despite being launched later, \"Voyager 1\" reached both Jupiter and Saturn sooner, following a shorter trajectory.\n\"Voyager 1\"'s launch almost failed because Titan's LR-91 second stage shut down prematurely, leaving of propellant unburned. Recognizing the deficiency, the Centaur stage's on-board computers ordered a burn that was far longer than planned in order to compensate. Centaur extended its own burn and was able to give \"Voyager 1\" the additional velocity it needed. \nAt cutoff, the Centaur was only 3.4 seconds from propellant exhaustion. If the same failure had occurred during \"Voyager 2\"'s launch a few weeks earlier, the Centaur would have run out of propellant before the probe reached the correct trajectory. Jupiter was in a more favorable position vis-\u00e0-vis Earth during the launch of \"Voyager 1\" than during the launch of \"Voyager 2\".\n\"Voyager 1\"'s initial orbit had an aphelion of , just a little short of Saturn's orbit of . \"Voyager 2\"'s initial orbit had an aphelion of , well short of Saturn's orbit.\nFlyby of Jupiter.\n\"Voyager 1\" began photographing Jupiter in January 1979. Its closest approach to Jupiter was on March 5, 1979, at a distance of about from the planet's center. Because of the greater photographic resolution allowed by a closer approach, most observations of the moons, rings, magnetic fields, and the radiation belt environment of the Jovian system were made during the 48-hour period that bracketed the closest approach. Voyager 1 finished photographing the Jovian system in April 1979.\nInformation gathered by the \"Pioneer 10\" spacecraft helped engineers design \"Voyager\" to better cope with the intense radiation around Jupiter. Still, shortly before launch, strips of kitchen-grade aluminium foil were applied to certain cables to improve radiation shielding.\nThe discovery of ongoing volcanic activity on the moon Io was probably the greatest surprise. It was the first time active volcanoes had been seen on another body in the Solar System. It appears that activity on Io affects the entire Jovian system. Io appears to be the primary source of matter that pervades the Jovian magnetosphere \u2013 the region of space that surrounds the planet influenced by the planet's strong magnetic field. Sulfur, oxygen, and sodium, apparently erupted by Io's volcanoes and sputtered off the surface by the impact of high-energy particles, were detected at the outer edge of the magnetosphere of Jupiter.\nThe two Voyager space probes made a number of important discoveries about Jupiter, its satellites, its radiation belts, and its never-before-seen planetary rings.\nFlyby of Saturn.\nThe gravitational assist trajectories at Jupiter were successfully carried out by both Voyagers, and the two spacecraft went on to visit Saturn and its system of moons and rings. \"Voyager 1\" encountered Saturn in November 1980, with the closest approach on November 12, 1980, when the space probe came within of Saturn's cloud-tops. The space probe's cameras detected complex structures in the rings of Saturn, and its remote sensing instruments studied the atmospheres of Saturn and its giant moon Titan.\n\"Voyager 1\" found that about seven percent of the volume of Saturn's upper atmosphere is helium (compared with 11 percent of Jupiter's atmosphere), while almost all the rest is hydrogen. Since Saturn's internal helium abundance was expected to be the same as Jupiter's and the Sun's, the lower abundance of helium in the upper atmosphere may imply that the heavier helium may be slowly sinking through Saturn's hydrogen; that might explain the excess heat that Saturn radiates over energy it receives from the Sun. Winds blow at high speeds on Saturn. Near the equator, the Voyagers measured winds about . The wind blows mostly in an easterly direction.\nThe Voyagers found aurora-like ultraviolet emissions of hydrogen at mid-latitudes in the atmosphere, and auroras at polar latitudes (above 65 degrees). The high-level auroral activity may lead to the formation of complex hydrocarbon molecules that are carried toward the equator. The mid-latitude auroras, which occur only in sunlit regions, remain a puzzle, since bombardment by electrons and ions, known to cause auroras on Earth, occurs primarily at high latitudes. Both Voyagers measured the rotation of Saturn (the length of a day) at 10 hours, 39 minutes, 24 seconds.\n\"Voyager 1\"'s mission included a flyby of Titan, Saturn's largest moon, which had long been known to have an atmosphere. Images taken by \"Pioneer 11\" in 1979 had indicated the atmosphere was substantial and complex, further increasing interest. The Titan flyby occurred as the spacecraft entered the system to avoid any possibility of damage closer to Saturn compromising observations, and approached to within , passing behind Titan as seen from Earth and the Sun.\nVoyager's measurement of the atmosphere's effect on sunlight and Earth-based measurement of its effect on the probe's radio signal were used to determine the atmosphere's composition, density, and pressure. Titan's mass was also measured by observing its effect on the probe's trajectory. The thick haze prevented any visual observation of the surface, but the measurement of the atmosphere's composition, temperature, and pressure led to speculation that lakes of liquid hydrocarbons could exist on the surface.\nBecause observations of Titan were considered vital, the trajectory chosen for \"Voyager 1\" was designed around the optimum Titan flyby, which took it below the south pole of Saturn and out of the plane of the ecliptic, ending its planetary science mission. Had \"Voyager 1\" failed or been unable to observe Titan, \"Voyager 2\"'s trajectory would have been altered to incorporate the Titan flyby, precluding any visit to Uranus and Neptune. The trajectory \"Voyager 1\" was launched into would not have allowed it to continue on to Uranus and Neptune, but could have been altered to avoid a Titan flyby and travel from Saturn to Pluto, arriving in 1986.\nExit from the heliosphere.\nOn February 14, 1990, \"Voyager 1\" took the first \"family portrait\" of the Solar System as seen from outside, which includes the image of planet Earth known as \"Pale Blue Dot\". Soon afterward, its cameras were deactivated to conserve energy and computer resources for other equipment. The camera software has been removed from the spacecraft, so it would now be complex to get them working again. Earth-side software and computers for reading the images are also no longer available.\nOn February 17, 1998, \"Voyager 1\" reached a distance of from the Sun and overtook \"Pioneer 10\" as the most distant spacecraft from Earth. Traveling at about , it has the fastest heliocentric recession speed of any spacecraft.\nAs \"Voyager 1\" headed for interstellar space, its instruments continued to study the Solar System. Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientists used the plasma wave experiments aboard \"Voyager 1\" and \"2\" to look for the heliopause, the boundary at which the solar wind transitions into the interstellar medium. As of 2013[ [update]], the probe was moving with a relative velocity to the Sun of about .\nWith the velocity the probe is currently maintaining, \"Voyager 1\" is traveling about per year, or about one light-year per 18,000 years.\nTermination shock.\nScientists at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory believe that \"Voyager 1\" entered the termination shock in February 2003. This marks the point where the solar wind slows to subsonic speeds. Some other scientists expressed doubt and discussed this in the journal \"Nature\" of November 6, 2003. The issue would not be resolved until other data became available, since \"Voyager 1\"'s solar-wind detector ceased functioning in 1990. This failure meant that termination shock detection would have to be inferred from the data from the other instruments on board.\nIn May 2005, a NASA press release said that the consensus was that \"Voyager 1\" was then in the heliosheath. In a scientific session at the American Geophysical Union meeting in New Orleans on May 25, 2005, Ed Stone presented evidence that the craft crossed the termination shock in late 2004. This event is estimated to have occurred on December 15, 2004, at a distance of from the Sun.\nHeliosheath.\nOn March 31, 2006, amateur radio operators from AMSAT in Germany tracked and received radio waves from \"Voyager 1\" using the dish at Bochum with a long integration technique. Retrieved data was checked and verified against data from the Deep Space Network station at Madrid, Spain. This seems to be the first such amateur tracking of \"Voyager 1\".\nIt was confirmed on December 13, 2010, that \"Voyager 1\" had passed the reach of the radial outward flow of the solar wind, as measured by the Low Energy Charged Particle device. It is suspected that solar wind at this distance turns sideways because of interstellar wind pushing against the heliosphere. Since June 2010, detection of solar wind had been consistently at zero, providing conclusive evidence of the event. On this date, the spacecraft was approximately from the Sun.\n\"Voyager 1\" was commanded to change its orientation to measure the sideways motion of the solar wind at that location in space in March 2011 (~33yr 6mo from launch). A test roll done in February had confirmed the spacecraft's ability to maneuver and reorient itself. The course of the spacecraft was not changed. It rotated 70 degrees counterclockwise with respect to Earth to detect the solar wind. This was the first time the spacecraft had done any major maneuvering since the \"Family Portrait\" photograph of the planets was taken in 1990. After the first roll the spacecraft had no problem in reorienting itself with Alpha Centauri, \"Voyager 1\"'s guide star, and it resumed sending transmissions back to Earth. \"Voyager 1\" was expected to enter interstellar space \"at any time\". \"Voyager 2\" was still detecting outward flow of solar wind at that point but it was estimated that in the following months or years it would experience the same conditions as \"Voyager 1\".\nThe spacecraft was reported at 12.44\u00b0 declination and 17.163 hours right ascension, and at an ecliptic latitude of 34.9\u00b0 (the ecliptic latitude changes very slowly), placing it in the constellation Ophiuchus as observed from the Earth on May 21, 2011.\nOn December 1, 2011, it was announced that \"Voyager 1\" had detected the first Lyman-alpha radiation originating from the Milky Way galaxy. Lyman-alpha radiation had previously been detected from other galaxies, but because of interference from the Sun, the radiation from the Milky Way was not detectable.\nNASA announced on December 5, 2011, that \"Voyager 1\" had entered a new region referred to as a \"cosmic purgatory\". Within this stagnation region, charged particles streaming from the Sun slow and turn inward, and the Solar System's magnetic field is doubled in strength as interstellar space appears to be applying pressure. Energetic particles originating in the Solar System decline by nearly half, while the detection of high-energy electrons from outside increases 100-fold. The inner edge of the stagnation region is located approximately 113 AU from the Sun.\nHeliopause.\nNASA announced in June 2012 that the probe was detecting changes in the environment that were suspected to correlate with arrival at the heliopause. \"Voyager 1\" had reported a marked increase in its detection of charged particles from interstellar space, which are normally deflected by the solar winds within the heliosphere from the Sun. The craft thus began to enter the interstellar medium at the edge of the Solar System.\n\"Voyager 1\" became the first spacecraft to cross the heliopause in August 2012, then at a distance of from the Sun, although this was not confirmed for another year.\nAs of September 2012, sunlight took 16.89 hours to get to \"Voyager 1\" which was at a distance of 121 AU. The apparent magnitude of the Sun from the spacecraft was \u221216.3 (about 30 times brighter than the full Moon). The spacecraft was traveling at relative to the Sun. At this rate, it would need about 17,565 years to travel a single light-year. To compare, Proxima Centauri, the closest star to the Sun, is about 4.2 light-years () distant. If the spacecraft was traveling in the direction of that star, it would take 73,775 years to reach it. \"Voyager 1\" is heading in the direction of the constellation Ophiuchus.\nIn late 2012, researchers reported that particle data from the spacecraft suggested that the probe had passed through the heliopause. Measurements from the spacecraft revealed a steady rise since May in collisions with high energy particles (above 70 MeV), which are thought to be cosmic rays emanating from supernova explosions far beyond the Solar System, with a sharp increase in these collisions in late August. At the same time, in late August, there was a dramatic drop in collisions with low-energy particles, which are thought to originate from the Sun.\nEd Roelof, a space scientist at Johns Hopkins University and principal investigator for the Low-Energy Charged Particle instrument on the spacecraft, declared that \"most scientists involved with \"Voyager 1\" would agree that [these two criteria] have been sufficiently satisfied\". However, the last criterion for officially declaring that \"Voyager 1\" had crossed the boundary, the expected change in magnetic field direction (from that of the Sun to that of the interstellar field beyond), had not been observed (the field had changed direction by only 2 degrees), which suggested to some that the nature of the edge of the heliosphere had been misjudged.\nOn December 3, 2012, Voyager project scientist Ed Stone of the California Institute of Technology said, \"Voyager has discovered a new region of the heliosphere that we had not realized was there. We're still inside, apparently. But the magnetic field now is connected to the outside. So it's like a highway letting particles in and out.\" The magnetic field in this region was 10 times more intense than \"Voyager 1\" encountered before the termination shock. It was expected to be the last barrier before the spacecraft exited the Solar System completely and entered interstellar space.\nInterstellar medium.\nIn March 2013, it was announced that \"Voyager 1\" might have become the first spacecraft to enter interstellar space, having detected a marked change in the plasma environment on August 25, 2012. However, until September 12, 2013, it was still an open question as to whether the new region was interstellar space or an unknown region of the Solar System. At that time, the former alternative was officially confirmed.\nIn 2013 \"Voyager 1\" was exiting the Solar System at a speed of about per year, which is 61,602 km/h, 4.83 times the diameter of Earth (12,742 km) per hour; whereas \"Voyager 2\" is going slower, leaving the Solar System at per year. Each year, \"Voyager 1\" increases its lead over \"Voyager 2\".\n\"Voyager 1\" reached a distance of from the Sun on May 18, 2016. On September 5, 2017, that had increased to about from the Sun, or just over 19 light-hours; at that time, \"Voyager 2\" was from the Sun.\nIts progress can be monitored at NASA's website.\nOn September 12, 2013, NASA officially confirmed that \"Voyager 1\" had reached the interstellar medium in August 2012 as previously observed. The generally accepted date of arrival is August 25, 2012 (approximately 10 days before the 35th anniversary of its launch), the date durable changes in the density of energetic particles were first detected. By this point, most space scientists had abandoned the hypothesis that a change in magnetic field direction must accompany a crossing of the heliopause; a new model of the heliopause predicted that no such change would be found.\nA key finding that persuaded many scientists that the heliopause had been crossed was an indirect measurement of an 80-fold increase in electron density, based on the frequency of plasma oscillations observed beginning on April 9, 2013, triggered by a solar outburst that had occurred in March 2012 (electron density is expected to be two orders of magnitude higher outside the heliopause than within). \nWeaker sets of oscillations measured in October and November 2012 provided additional data. An indirect measurement was required because \"Voyager 1\"'s plasma spectrometer had stopped working in 1980. In September 2013, NASA released recordings of audio transductions of these plasma waves, the first to be measured in interstellar space.\nWhile \"Voyager 1\" is commonly spoken of as having left the Solar System simultaneously with having left the heliosphere, the two are not the same. The Solar System is usually defined as the vastly larger region of space populated by bodies that orbit the Sun. The craft is presently less than one-seventh the distance to the aphelion of Sedna, and it has not yet entered the Oort cloud, the source region of long-period comets, regarded by astronomers as the outermost zone of the Solar System.\nIn October 2020, astronomers reported a significant unexpected increase in density in the space beyond the Solar System as detected by the \"Voyager 1\" and \"Voyager 2\" space probes. According to the researchers, this implies that \"the density gradient is a large-scale feature of the VLISM (very local interstellar medium) in the general direction of the heliospheric nose\".\nIn May 2021, NASA reported on the continuous measurement, for the first time, of the density of material in interstellar space and, as well, the detection of interstellar sounds for the first time.\nCommunication issues.\nIn May 2022, NASA reported that \"Voyager 1\" had begun transmitting \"mysterious\" and \"peculiar\" telemetric data to the Deep Space Network (DSN). It confirmed that the operational status of the craft remained unchanged, but that the issue stemmed from the Attitude Articulation and Control System (AACS). NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory published a statement on May 18, 2022, that the AACS was functional but sending invalid data. \nThe problem was eventually traced to the AACS sending its telemetry through a computer that had been non-operational for years, resulting in data corruption. In August 2022, NASA transmitted a command to the AACS to use another computer, which resolved the problem. An investigation into what caused the initial switch is underway, though engineers have hypothesized that the AACS had executed a bad command from another onboard computer.\n\"Voyager 1\" began transmitting unreadable data on November 14, 2023. On December 12, 2023, NASA announced that \"Voyager 1\"'s flight data system was unable to use its telemetry modulation unit, preventing it from transmitting scientific data. On March 24, 2024, NASA announced that they had made significant progress on interpreting the data being received from the spacecraft. Engineers reported in April 2024 that the failure was likely in a memory bank of the Flight Data Subsystem (FDS), one of the three onboard computer systems, probably from being struck by a high-energy particle or that it simply wore out due to age. The FDS was not communicating properly with the telemetry modulation unit (TMU), which began transmitting a repeating sequence of ones and zeros indicating that the system was in a stuck condition. After a reboot of the FDS, communications remained unusable. \nThe probe still received commands from Earth, and was sending a carrier tone indicating it was still operational. Commands sent to alter the modulation of the tone succeeded, confirming that the probe was still responsive. The \"Voyager\" team began developing a workaround, and on April 20 communication of health and status was restored by rearranging code away from the defective FDS memory chip, three percent of which was corrupted beyond repair. \nBecause the memory is corrupted, the code needed to be relocated, but there were no place for an extra 256 bits; the spacecraft's total memory is only 68 kilobytes. To make it work, the engineers deleted unused code, for example the code used to transmit the data from Jupiter, that cannot be used at the current transmission rate. All the data from the \"anomaly period\" is lost. On May 22, NASA announced that Voyager 1 \"resumed returning science data from two of its four instruments\", with work towards the others ongoing. On June 13, NASA confirmed that the probe returns data from all four instruments.\nIn October 2024, the probe turned off its X-band radio transmitter that was used for communications with the DSN. It was caused by the probe's fault protection system that was activated after NASA turned on one of the heaters on October 16. Fault protection system lowered the transmission rate, but the engineers were able to find the signal. Later, on October 19, the transmission stopped; the fault protection system was triggered once again and switched to the S-band transmitter, that was previously used in 1981. NASA reported that the team reactivated the X-band transmitter and then resumed collecting data in mid-November.\nBetween 4 May 2025 and February\u202f2026, Deep Space Station\u202f43 in Canberra\u2014the only antenna capable of sending commands to Voyager\u202f1 and 2\u2014will be offline for major upgrades, with only limited operational windows in August and December 2025. This created a critical deadline for engineers to revive backup roll thrusters before any full loss of communication.\nFuture of the probe.\nRemaining lifespan.\nIn December 2017, NASA successfully fired all four of \"Voyager 1\"'s trajectory correction maneuver (TCM) thrusters for the first time since 1980. The TCM thrusters were used in the place of a degraded set of jets to help keep the probe's antenna pointed towards Earth. Using the TCM thrusters allowed \"Voyager 1\" to continue transmitting data to NASA for two to three more years.\nDue to the diminishing electrical power available, the Voyager team has had to prioritize which instruments to keep on and which to turn off. Heaters and other spacecraft systems have been turned off one by one as part of power management. The fields and particles instruments that are the most likely to send back key data about the heliosphere and interstellar space have been prioritized to keep operating. Engineers expect the spacecraft to continue operating at least one science instrument until around 2025.\nConcerns with the orientation thrusters.\nSome thrusters needed to control the attitude of the spacecraft and point its high-gain antenna in the direction of Earth are out of use due to clogging problems in their hydrazine lines. The spacecraft no longer has a backup available for its thruster system and \"everything onboard is single-string,\" according to Suzanne Dodd, Voyager project manager at JPL, in an interview with \"Ars Technica\". NASA has accordingly decided to modify the spacecraft's computer software in order to reduce the rate at which the hydrazine lines clog. NASA will first deploy the modified software on \"Voyager 2\", which is less distant from Earth, before deploying it on \"Voyager 1\".\nIn September 2024, NASA performed a \"thruster swap\", switching from a clogged set of thrusters to less clogged ones that had not been used since 2018.\nIn May 2025, the team was able to revive the backup thrusters used for roll motion that were unusable since 2004.\nFar future.\nProvided \"Voyager 1\" does not collide with anything and is not retrieved, the \"New Horizons\" space probe will never pass it, despite being launched from Earth at a higher speed than either Voyager spacecraft. The Voyager spacecraft benefited from multiple planetary flybys to increase its heliocentric velocities, whereas \"New Horizons\" received only a single such boost, from its Jupiter flyby in 2007. As of 2018[ [update]], \"New Horizons\" is traveling at about , slower than \"Voyager 1\", and \"New Horizons\", being closer to the sun, is slowing more rapidly.\n\"Voyager 1\" is expected to reach the theorized Oort cloud in about 300 years and take about 30,000 years to pass through it. Though it is not heading towards any particular star, in about 40,000 years, it will pass within of the star Gliese 445, which is in the constellation Camelopardalis and 17.1 light-years from Earth (as of 2010). That star is generally moving towards the Solar System at about . NASA says that \"The Voyagers are destined\u00a0\u2013 perhaps eternally\u00a0\u2013 to wander the Milky Way.\" In 300,000 years, it will pass within less than 1 light-year of the M3V star TYC 3135\u201352\u20131.\nGolden record.\nBoth Voyager space probes carry a gold-plated audio-visual disc, a compilation meant to showcase the diversity of life and culture on Earth in the event that either spacecraft is ever found by any extraterrestrial discoverer. The record, made under the direction of a team including Carl Sagan and Timothy Ferris, includes photos of the Earth and its lifeforms, a range of scientific information, spoken greetings from people such as the Secretary-General of the United Nations (Kurt Waldheim) and a medley, \"Sounds of Earth\". \nIt includes the sounds of whales, a baby crying, waves breaking on a shore, and a collection of music spanning different cultures and eras including works by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Blind Willie Johnson, Chuck Berry and Valya Balkanska. Other Eastern and Western classics are included, as well as performances of indigenous and folk music from around the world. The record also contains greetings in 55 different languages. The project aimed to portray the richness of life on Earth and stand as a testament to human creativity and the desire to connect with the cosmos.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was launched on a trajectory towards the gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn) and enabled further encounters with the ice giants (Uranus and Neptune). The only spacecraft to have visited either of the ice giant planets, it was the third of five spacecraft to achieve Solar escape velocity, which allowed it to leave the Solar System. Launched 16 days before its twin \"Voyager 1\", the primary mission of the spacecraft was to study the outer planets and its extended mission is to study interstellar space beyond the Sun's heliosphere.\n\"Voyager 2\" successfully fulfilled its primary mission of visiting the Jovian system in 1979, the Saturnian system in 1981, Uranian system in 1986, and the Neptunian system in 1989. The spacecraft is in its extended mission of studying the interstellar medium. It is at a distance of from Earth as of \u00a02025[ [update]].\nThe probe entered the interstellar medium on November 5, 2018, at a distance of from the Sun and moving at a velocity of relative to the Sun. \"Voyager 2\" has left the Sun's heliosphere and is traveling through the interstellar medium, though still inside the Solar System, joining \"Voyager 1\", which had reached the interstellar medium in 2012. \"Voyager 2\" has begun to provide the first direct measurements of the density and temperature of the interstellar plasma.\n\"Voyager 2\" is in contact with Earth through the NASA Deep Space Network. Communications are the responsibility of Australia's DSS 43 communication antenna, near Canberra.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nIn the early space age, it was realized that a periodic alignment of the outer planets would occur in the late 1970s and enable a single probe to visit Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune by taking advantage of the then-new technique of gravity assists. NASA began work on a Grand Tour, which evolved into a massive project involving two groups of two probes each, with one group visiting Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto and the other Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune. The spacecraft would be designed with redundant systems to ensure survival throughout the entire tour. By 1972 the mission was scaled back and replaced with two Mariner program-derived spacecraft, the Mariner Jupiter-Saturn probes. To keep apparent lifetime program costs low, the mission would include only flybys of Jupiter and Saturn, but keep the Grand Tour option open. As the program progressed, the name was changed to Voyager.\nThe primary mission of \"Voyager 1\" was to explore Jupiter, Saturn, and Saturn's largest moon, Titan. \"Voyager 2\" was also to explore Jupiter and Saturn, but on a trajectory that would have the option of continuing on to Uranus and Neptune, or being redirected to Titan as a backup for \"Voyager 1\". Upon successful completion of \"Voyager 1\"'s objectives, \"Voyager 2\" would get a mission extension to send the probe on towards Uranus and Neptune.\nTitan was selected due to the interest developed after the images taken by \"Pioneer 11\" in 1979, which had indicated the atmosphere of the moon was substantial and complex. Hence the trajectory was designed for optimum Titan flyby.\nSpacecraft design.\nConstructed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), \"Voyager 2\", whose bus is shaped like a decagonal prism, included 16 hydrazine thrusters, three-axis stabilization, gyroscopes and celestial referencing instruments (a Sun sensor, and a Canopus star tracker) to maintain pointing of the high-gain antenna toward Earth. Collectively these instruments are part of the Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS) along with redundant units of most instruments and 8 backup thrusters. The spacecraft also included 11 scientific instruments to study celestial objects as it traveled through space.\nCommunications.\nBuilt with the intent for eventual interstellar travel, \"Voyager 2\" included a large, parabolic, high-gain antenna () to transceive data via the Deep Space Network on Earth. Communications are conducted over the S-band (about 13\u00a0cm wavelength) and X-band (about 3.6\u00a0cm wavelength) providing data rates as high as 115.2 kilobits per second at the distance of Jupiter, and then ever-decreasing as distance increases, because of the inverse-square law. When the spacecraft is unable to communicate with Earth, the Digital Tape Recorder (DTR) can record about 64 megabytes of data for transmission at another time.\nPower.\n\"Voyager 2\" is equipped with three multihundred-watt radioisotope thermoelectric generators (MHW RTGs). Each RTG includes 24 pressed plutonium oxide spheres. At launch, each RTG provided enough heat to generate approximately 157 W of electrical power. Collectively, the RTGs supplied the spacecraft with 470 watts at launch (halving every 87.7 years). They were predicted to allow operations to continue until at least 2020, and continued to provide power to five scientific instruments through the early part of 2023. In April 2023 JPL began using a reservoir of backup power intended for an onboard safety mechanism. As a result, all five instruments had been expected to continue operation through 2026. In October 2024 NASA announced that the plasma science instrument had been turned off, preserving power for the remaining four instruments.\nAttitude control and propulsion.\nBecause of the energy required to achieve a Jupiter trajectory boost with an payload, the spacecraft included a propulsion module made of a solid-rocket motor and eight hydrazine monopropellant rocket engines, four providing pitch and yaw attitude control, and four for roll control. The propulsion module was jettisoned shortly after the successful Jupiter burn.\nSixteen hydrazine Aerojet MR-103 thrusters on the mission module provide attitude control. Four are used to execute trajectory correction maneuvers; the others in two redundant six-thruster branches, to stabilize the spacecraft on its three axes. Only one branch of attitude control thrusters is needed at any time.\nThrusters are supplied by a single diameter spherical titanium tank. It contained of hydrazine at launch, providing enough fuel until 2034.\nMission profile.\nLaunch and trajectory.\nThe \"Voyager 2\" probe was launched on August 20, 1977, by NASA from Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral, Florida, aboard a Titan IIIE/Centaur launch vehicle. Two weeks later, the twin \"Voyager 1\" probe was launched on September 5, 1977. However, \"Voyager 1\" reached both Jupiter and Saturn sooner, as \"Voyager 2\" had been launched into a longer, more circular trajectory.\n\"Voyager 1\"'s initial orbit had an aphelion of , just a little short of Saturn's orbit of . Whereas, \"Voyager 2\"'s initial orbit had an aphelion of , well short of Saturn's orbit.\nIn April 1978, no commands were transmitted to \"Voyager 2\" for a period of time, causing the spacecraft to switch from its primary radio receiver to its backup receiver. Sometime afterwards, the primary receiver failed altogether. The backup receiver was functional, but a failed capacitor in the receiver meant that it could only receive transmissions that were sent at a precise frequency, and this frequency would be affected by the Earth's rotation (due to the Doppler effect) and the onboard receiver's temperature, among other things.\nEncounter with Jupiter.\n\"Voyager 2\"'s closest approach to Jupiter occurred at 22:29 UT on July 9, 1979. It came within of the planet's cloud tops.\nJupiter's Great Red Spot was revealed as a complex storm moving in a counterclockwise direction. Other smaller storms and eddies were found throughout the banded clouds.\n\"Voyager 2\" returned images of Jupiter, as well as its moons Amalthea, Io, Callisto, Ganymede, and Europa. During a 10-hour \"volcano watch\", it confirmed \"Voyager 1\"'s observations of active volcanism on the moon Io, and revealed how the moon's surface had changed in the four months since the previous visit. Together, the Voyagers observed the eruption of nine volcanoes on Io, and there is evidence that other eruptions occurred between the two Voyager fly-bys.\nJupiter's moon Europa displayed a large number of intersecting linear features in the low-resolution photos from \"Voyager 1\". At first, scientists believed the features might be deep cracks, caused by crustal rifting or tectonic processes. Closer high-resolution photos from \"Voyager 2\", however, were puzzling: the features lacked topographic relief, and one scientist said they \"might have been painted on with a felt marker\". Europa is internally active due to tidal heating at a level about one-tenth that of Io. Europa is thought to have a thin crust (less than thick) of water ice, possibly floating on a -deep ocean.\nTwo new, small satellites, Adrastea and Metis, were found orbiting just outside the ring. A third new satellite, Thebe, was discovered between the orbits of Amalthea and Io.\nEncounter with Saturn.\nThe closest approach to Saturn occurred at 03:24:05 UT on August 26, 1981. When \"Voyager 2\" passed behind Saturn, viewed from Earth, it utilized its radio link to investigate Saturn's upper atmosphere, gathering data on both temperature and pressure. In the highest regions of the atmosphere, where the pressure was measured at , \"Voyager 2\" recorded a temperature of . Deeper within the atmosphere, where the pressure was recorded to be , the temperature rose to . The spacecraft also observed that the north pole was approximately cooler at than mid-latitudes, a variance potentially attributable to seasonal shifts (\"see also Saturn Oppositions\").\nAfter its Saturn fly-by, \"Voyager 2\"'s scan platform experienced an anomaly causing its azimuth actuator to seize. This malfunction led to some data loss and posed challenges for the spacecraft's continued mission. The anomaly was traced back to a combination of issues, including a design flaw in the actuator shaft bearing and gear lubrication system, corrosion, and debris build-up. While overuse and depleted lubricant were factors, other elements, such as dissimilar metal reactions and a lack of relief ports, compounded the problem. Engineers on the ground were able to issue a series of commands, rectifying the issue to a degree that allowed the scan platform to resume its function. \"Voyager 2\", which would have been diverted to perform the Titan flyby if \"Voyager 1\" had been unable to, did not pass near Titan due to the malfunction, and subsequently, proceeded with its mission to explore the Uranian system.\nEncounter with Uranus.\nThe closest approach to Uranus occurred on January 24, 1986, when \"Voyager 2\" came within of the planet's cloudtops. \"Voyager 2\" also discovered 11 previously unknown moons: Cordelia, Ophelia, Bianca, Cressida, Desdemona, Juliet, Portia, Rosalind, Belinda, Puck and Perdita. The mission also studied the planet's unique atmosphere, caused by its axial tilt of 97.8\u00b0, and examined the Uranian ring system. The length of a day on Uranus as measured by \"Voyager 2\" is 17 hours, 14 minutes. Uranus was shown to have a magnetic field that was misaligned with its rotational axis, unlike other planets that had been visited to that point, and a helix-shaped magnetic tail stretching 10 million kilometers (6 million miles) away from the Sun.\nWhen \"Voyager 2\" visited Uranus, much of its cloud features were hidden by a layer of haze; however, false-color and contrast-enhanced images show bands of concentric clouds around its south pole. This area was also found to radiate large amounts of ultraviolet light, a phenomenon that is called \"dayglow\". The average atmospheric temperature is about . The illuminated and dark poles, and most of the planet, exhibit nearly the same temperatures at the cloud tops.\nThe \"Voyager 2\" Planetary Radio Astronomy (PRA) experiment observed 140 lightning flashes, or Uranian electrostatic discharges with a frequency of 0.9-40 MHz. The UEDs were detected from of Uranus over 24 hours, most of which were not visible. However, microphysical modeling suggests that Uranian lightning occurs in convective storms occurring in deep troposphere water clouds. If this is the case, lightning will not be visible due to the thick cloud layers above the troposphere. Uranian lightning has a power of around 108 W, emits 1\u00d710^7 J \u2013 2\u00d710^7 J of energy, and lasts an average of 120 ms.\nDetailed images from \"Voyager 2\"'s flyby of the Uranian moon Miranda showed huge canyons made from geological faults. One hypothesis suggests that Miranda might consist of a reaggregation of material following an earlier event when Miranda was shattered into pieces by a violent impact.\n\"Voyager 2\" discovered two previously unknown Uranian rings. Measurements showed that the Uranian rings are different from those at Jupiter and Saturn. The Uranian ring system might be relatively young, and it did not form at the same time that Uranus did. The particles that make up the rings might be the remnants of a moon that was broken up by either a high-velocity impact or torn up by tidal effects.\nIn March 2020, NASA astronomers reported the detection of a large atmospheric magnetic bubble, also known as a plasmoid, released into outer space from the planet Uranus, after reevaluating old data recorded during the flyby.\nEncounter with Neptune.\nFollowing a course correction in 1987, \"Voyager 2\"'s closest approach to Neptune occurred on August 25, 1989. Through repeated computerized test simulations of trajectories through the Neptunian system conducted in advance, flight controllers determined the best way to route \"Voyager\u00a02\" through the Neptune\u2013Triton system. Since the plane of the orbit of Triton is tilted significantly with respect to the plane of the ecliptic; through course corrections, \"Voyager\u00a02\" was directed into a path about above the north pole of Neptune. Five hours after \"Voyager 2\" made its closest approach to Neptune, it performed a close fly-by of Triton, Neptune's largest moon, passing within about .\nIn 1989, the \"Voyager 2\" Planetary Radio Astronomy (PRA) experiment observed around 60 lightning flashes, or Neptunian electrostatic discharges emitting energies over 7\u00d7108\u00a0J. A plasma wave system (PWS) detected 16 electromagnetic wave events with a frequency range of 50\u00a0Hz\u00a0\u2013 12\u00a0kHz at magnetic latitudes 7\u02da\u201333\u02da. These plasma wave detections were possibly triggered by lightning over 20 minutes in the ammonia clouds of the magnetosphere. During \"Voyager 2\"'s closest approach to Neptune, the PWS instrument provided Neptune\u2019s first plasma wave detections at a sample rate of 28,800 samples per second. The measured plasma densities range from 10\u20133 \u2013 10\u20131 cm\u20133.\n\"Voyager 2\" discovered previously unknown Neptunian rings, and confirmed six new moons: Despina, Galatea, Larissa, Proteus, Naiad and Thalassa. While in the neighborhood of Neptune, \"Voyager 2\" discovered the \"Great Dark Spot\", which has since disappeared, according to observations by the Hubble Space Telescope. The Great Dark Spot was later hypothesized to be a region of clear gas, forming a window in the planet's high-altitude methane cloud deck.\nInterstellar mission.\nOnce its planetary mission was over, \"Voyager 2\" was described as working on an interstellar mission, which NASA is using to find out what the Solar System is like beyond the heliosphere. As of \u00a02023[ [update]] \"Voyager 2\" is transmitting scientific data at about 160 bits per second. Information about continuing telemetry exchanges with \"Voyager 2\" is available from Voyager Weekly Reports.\nIn 1992, \"Voyager 2\" observed the nova V1974 Cygni in the far-ultraviolet, first of its kind. The further increase in the brightness at those wavelengths helped in the more detailed study of the nova.\nIn July 1994, an attempt was made to observe the impacts from fragments of the comet Comet Shoemaker\u2013Levy 9 with Jupiter. The craft's position meant it had a direct line of sight to the impacts and observations were made in the ultraviolet and radio spectrum. \"Voyager 2\" failed to detect anything, with calculations showing that the fireballs were just below the craft's limit of detection.\nOn November 29, 2006, a telemetered command to \"Voyager 2\" was incorrectly decoded by its on-board computer\u2014in a random error\u2014as a command to turn on the electrical heaters of the spacecraft's magnetometer. These heaters remained turned on until December 4, 2006, and during that time, there was a resulting high temperature above , significantly higher than the magnetometers were designed to endure, and a sensor rotated away from the correct orientation.\nOn August 30, 2007, \"Voyager 2\" passed the termination shock and then entered into the heliosheath, approximately closer to the Sun than \"Voyager 1\" did. This is due to the interstellar magnetic field of deep space. The southern hemisphere of the Solar System's heliosphere is being pushed in.\nOn April 22, 2010, \"Voyager 2\" encountered scientific data format problems. On May 17, 2010, JPL engineers revealed that a flipped bit in an on-board computer had caused the problem, and scheduled a bit reset for May 19. On May 23, 2010, \"Voyager 2\" resumed sending science data from deep space after engineers fixed the flipped bit.\nIn 2013, it was originally thought that \"Voyager 2\" would enter interstellar space in two to three years, with its plasma spectrometer providing the first direct measurements of the density and temperature of the interstellar plasma. But the Voyager project scientist, Edward C. Stone and his colleagues said they lacked evidence of what would be the key signature of interstellar space: a shift in the direction of the magnetic field. Finally, in December 2018, Stone announced that \"Voyager 2\" reached interstellar space on November 5, 2018.\nMaintenance to the Deep Space Network cut outbound contact with the probe for eight months in 2020. Contact was reestablished on November 2, when a series of instructions was transmitted, subsequently executed, and relayed back with a successful communication message. On February 12, 2021, full communications were restored after a major ground station antenna upgrade that took a year to complete.\nIn October 2020, astronomers reported a significant unexpected increase in density in the space beyond the Solar System as detected by the \"Voyager 1\" and \"Voyager 2\"; this implies that \"the density gradient is a large-scale feature of the VLISM (very local interstellar medium) in the general direction of the heliospheric nose\".\nOn July 18, 2023, Voyager 2 overtook \"Pioneer 10\" as the second farthest spacecraft from the Sun.\nOn July 21, 2023, a programming error misaligned \"Voyager 2\"'s high gain antenna 2 degrees away from Earth, breaking communications with the spacecraft. By August 1, the spacecraft's carrier signal was detected using multiple antennas of the Deep Space Network. A high-power \"shout\" on August 4 sent from the Canberra station successfully commanded the spacecraft to reorient towards Earth, resuming communications. As a failsafe measure, the probe is also programmed to autonomously reset its orientation to point towards Earth, which would have occurred by October 15.\nReductions in capabilities.\nAs the power from the RTG slowly reduces, various items of equipment have been turned off on the spacecraft. The first science equipment turned off on \"Voyager 2\" was the PPS in 1991, which saved 1.2 watts.\nConcerns with the orientation thrusters.\nSome thrusters needed to control the correct attitude of the spacecraft and to point its high-gain antenna in the direction of Earth are out of use due to clogging problems in their hydrazine injector. The spacecraft no longer has backups available for its thruster system and \"everything onboard is running on single-string\" as acknowledged by Suzanne Dodd, Voyager project manager at JPL, in an interview with Ars Technica. NASA has decided to patch the computer software in order to modify the functioning of the remaining thrusters to slow down the clogging of the small diameter hydrazine injector jets. Before uploading the software update on the \"Voyager 1\" computer, NASA will first try the procedure with \"Voyager 2\", which is closer to Earth.\nFuture of the probe.\nThe probe is expected to keep transmitting weak radio messages until at least the mid-2020s, more than 48 years after it was launched. NASA says that \"The Voyagers are destined\u2014perhaps eternally\u2014to wander the Milky Way.\"\n\"Voyager 2\" is not headed toward any particular star. The nearest star is 4.2 light-years away, and at 15.341 km/s, the spacecraft travels one light-year in about 19,541 years \u2014 during which time the nearby stars will also move substantially. In roughly 42,000 years, Voyager 2 will pass the star Ross 248 (10.30 light-years away from Earth) at a distance of 1.7 light-years. If undisturbed for 296,000 years, \"Voyager 2\" should pass by the star Sirius (8.6 light-years from Earth) at a distance of 4.3 light-years.\nGolden record.\nBoth Voyager space probes carry a gold-plated audio-visual disc, a compilation meant to showcase the diversity of life and culture on Earth in the event that either spacecraft is ever found by any extraterrestrial discoverer. The record, made under the direction of a team including Carl Sagan and Timothy Ferris, includes photos of the Earth and its lifeforms, a range of scientific information, spoken greetings from people such as the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and a medley, \"Sounds of Earth\", that includes the sounds of whales, a baby crying, waves breaking on a shore, and a collection of music spanning different cultures and eras including works by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Blind Willie Johnson, Chuck Berry and Valya Balkanska. Other Eastern and Western classics are included, as well as performances of indigenous music from around the world. The record also contains greetings in 55 different languages. The project aimed to portray the richness of life on Earth and stand as a testament to human creativity and the desire to connect with the cosmos.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Debates surrounding various positions partly revolve around how antisemitism is defined, and on scholarly disagreements over whether antisemitism has a monolithic continuous history or is instead an umbrella term covering many distinct kinds of hostility to Jews over history.\nFactional agendas underpin the writing of the canonical texts, and the various New Testament documents are windows into the conflict and debates of that period. According to Timothy Johnson, mutual slandering among competing sects was quite strong in the period when these works were composed. The New Testament moreover is an ensemble of texts written over decades and \"it is quite meaningless to speak about a single New Testament attitude\".\nThe New Testament and Christian antisemitism.\nAccording to Rabbi Michael J. Cook, Professor of Intertestamental and Early Christian Literature at the Hebrew Union College, there are ten themes in the New Testament that have been sources of anti-Judaism and antisemitism:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCook believes that both contemporary Jews and contemporary Christians need to reexamine the history of early Christianity, and the transformation of Christianity from a Jewish sect consisting of followers of a Jewish Jesus, to a separate religion often dependent on the tolerance of Rome while proselytizing among gentiles loyal to the Roman Empire, to understand how the story of Jesus came to be recast in an anti-Jewish form as the Gospels took their final form.\nSome scholars say that critical verses in the New Testament have been used to incite prejudice and violence against Jewish people. Professor Lillian C. Freudmann, author of \"Antisemitism in the New Testament\" (University Press of America, 1994) has published a study of such verses and the effects that they have had in the Christian community throughout history. Similar studies have been made by both Christian and Jewish scholars, including, Professors Clark Williamsom (Christian Theological Seminary), Hyam Maccoby (The Leo Baeck Institute), and Norman A. Beck (Texas Lutheran College).\nNew Testament.\nThere are some verses in the New Testament that describe Jews in a positive way, attributing to them salvation or divine love.\nAccording to the New Testament Gospels, Jesus, on his fateful entry into Jerusalem before Passover, was received by a great crowd of people. Jesus was arrested and tried by the Sanhedrin. After the trial, Jesus was handed over to Pontius Pilate, who duly tried him again and, at the urging of the people, had him crucified.\nThe New Testament records that Jesus' disciple Judas Iscariot, the Roman governor Pontius Pilate along with Roman forces and the leaders and people of Jerusalem were (to varying degrees) responsible for the death of Jesus.\nGospel of Mark.\nAccording to the Gospel of Mark, the crucifixion of Jesus was authorized by Roman authorities at the insistence of leading Jews (Judeans) from the Sanhedrin.\nPaul H. Jones writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Although Mark depicts all of the Jewish groups united in their opposition to Jesus, his passion narratives are not \"overtly\" anti-Jewish, since they can be interpreted as falling within the range of \"acceptable\" intra-Jewish disputes. To some readers, the \"cleansing of the Temple\" scene (11:15-19) framed by the \"withered fig tree\" pericopes confirms God's judgment against the Jews and their Temple. Most likely, however, the story explains for this small sect of Jesus followers that survived the Roman-Jewish War why God permitted the destruction of the Temple. It is an in-house interpretation and, therefore, not anti-Jewish. Likewise, the parable of the vineyard (12:1-12), by which the traditional allegorical interpretation casts the tenants as the Jews, the murdered heir as Jesus, and the owner as God, must be set within the context of an intra-Jewish dispute.\nGospel of Matthew.\nThe Gospel of Matthew is often evaluated as the most Jewish of the canonical gospels, and yet it is sometimes said that it is anti-Judaic or antisemitic.\nThe Gospel of Matthew has given readers the impression his hostility to Jews increases as his narrative progresses, until it culminates in chapter 23. In chapter 21, the parable of the vineyard, which is strikingly similar to Isaiah 5:1-30, is followed by the great \"stone\" text, an early Christological interpretation of Psalm 118: \"The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone\". The Old Testament allusions appear to suggest that the author thought God would call to account Israel's leaders for maltreating Christ, and that the covenant will pass to the gentiles who follow Christ, a view that arose in intersectarian polemics in Judaism between the followers of Christ and the Jewish leadership. Then, in chapters 23 and 24, three successive hostile pericopes are recorded. First, a series of \"woes\" are pronounced against the Pharisees:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;you testify against yourselves that you are descendants of those who murdered the prophets...You snakes, you brood of vipers! How can you escape being sentenced to hell?\u2014\u200a\nCertain passages which speak of the destruction of Jerusalem have elements that are interpreted as indications of Matthew's anti-Judaic attitudes. Jesus is said to have lamented over the capital: \"Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it...See, your house is left to you, desolate\". Again, Jesus is made to predict the demise of the Temple: \"Truly I tell you, not one stone will be left here upon another; all will be thrown down\". Such visions of an end to the old Temple may be read as embodying the replacement theology, according to which Christianity supersedes Judaism.\nThe culmination of this rhetoric, and arguably the one verse that has caused more Jewish suffering than any other second Testament passage, is the uniquely Matthean attribution to the Jewish people:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;His [Jesus's] blood be on us and on our children!\u2014\u200a\nThis \"blood guilt\" text has been interpreted by some to mean that all Jews, of Jesus' time and forever afterward, accept responsibility for the death of Jesus. Shelly Matthews writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In Matthew, as in many books of the New Testament, the idea that Christ followers are persecuted is pervasive. Blessings are pronounced on those who are persecuted for righteousness sake in the Sermon on the Mount; the woes against the Pharisees in Matthew 23 culminate in predictions that they will \"kill and crucify, flog in synagogues, and pursue from town to town;\" the parable of the banquet in Matthew 22 implies that servants of the king will be killed by those to whom they are sent.\nDouglas Hare noted that the Gospel of Matthew avoids sociological explanations for persecution:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Only the theological cause, the obduracy of Israel is of interest to the author. Nor is the mystery of Israel's sin probed, whether in terms of dualistic categories or in terms of predestinarianism. Israel's sin is a fact of history which requires no explanation.\nThe term \"Jews\" in the Gospel of Matthew is applied to those who deny the resurrection of Jesus and believe that the disciples stole Jesus's corpse.\nGospel of John.\nIn the Gospel of John, the word \u1f38\u03bf\u03c5\u03b4\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9, usually translated \"the Jews\", is used 63 times, in a hostile sense 31 times, and no distinctions are made between Jewish groups. The Sadducees, for example, prominent elsewhere, are not distinguished. The enemies of Jesus are described collectively as the \"\", in contradistinction to the other evangelists, who do not generally ascribe to the \"\" collectively calls for the death of Jesus. In the other three texts, the plot to put Jesus to death is always presented as coming from a small group of priests and rulers, the Sadducees. The Gospel of John is the primary source of the image of \"the Jews\" acting collectively as the enemy of Jesus, which later became fixed in Christian minds.\nIn several places, John's gospel also associates the \"\" with darkness and with the devil. In John 8:37-39; 44\u201347, Jesus says, speaking to a group of Pharisees:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I know that you are descendants of Abraham; yet you seek to kill me, because my word finds no place in you. I speak of what I have seen with my Father, and you do what you have heard from your father. They answered him, \"Abraham is our father.\" Jesus said to them, \"If you were Abraham's children, you would do what Abraham did. ... You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and has nothing to do with the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks according to his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies. But, because I tell the truth, you do not believe me. Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me? He who is of God hears the words of God; the reason why you do not hear them is you are not of God.\nAlthough the modern consensus is that the term \" (Jews) in John refers exclusively to religious authorities, the basis for this statement has been challenged and John's use of the term \" remains a complex and debated area of biblical scholarship, though it is accepted that it is not a case of antisemitism. New Testament scholar J.G. Dunn writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReflecting the consensus that John's use of the term refers strictly to Jewish religious authorities, some modern translations, such as Today's New International Version, remove the term \"Jews\" and replace it with more specific terms to avoid antisemitic connotations. For example, Messianic Bibles, as well as the Jesus Seminar, often translate this as \"Judeans\", i.e. residents of Judea, in contrast to residents of Galilee. \nLater commentary.\nSuccessive generations of Christians read in the Gospel of John the collective guilt of Jews, universally and in all generations, in the death of Christ. John's use of the collective expression \"the Jews\" is likely explained by the historical circumstances and audience for which he wrote. With the destruction of the Temple in 70 AD, the Jewish priesthood, and thus the class of the Sadducees was massacred and thus ceased to exist, due to its role in the First Jewish\u2013Roman War. As John wrote his Gospel after these events, for a gentile audience, he spoke generically of Jews, rather than specifying a group within Judaism that no longer existed and that would have been unfamiliar to his readers.\nFirst Epistle to the Thessalonians.\nPaul writes in 1 Thessalonians 2:14-16 as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For you, brothers and sisters, became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus that are in Judea, for you suffered the same things from your own compatriots as they did from the Jews, who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out; they displease God and oppose everyone by hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved. Thus they have constantly been filling up the measure of their sins; but God's wrath has overtaken them at last.\nThe text appears somewhat anomalous compared to the general tone of thanksgiving, in that there is a diatribe against persecutors identified as Jews. The text appears to flagrantly contradict what Paul writes in chapters 9 to 11 of his Epistle to the Romans. This has led several scholars to question its authenticity, and suggest that it is an interpolation. According to Pieter Willem van der Horst, there is an instance of antisemitic statements in one of the Pauline epistles; David Luckensmeyer maintains that it was not written with the intent to condemn all Jews, Paul's letters reveal someone who lived his life within Judaism, but did at the same time have an antisemitic effect. F. F. Bruce called it an 'indiscriminate anti-Jewish polemic' mirroring Graeco-Roman pagan attitudes to the Jews. Gene Green, Ernest Best, T. Holtz, Amy Downey variously say that it resonates with Old Testament themes, plays on Jewish fears of being the \"privileged people of God\" and typical of an argumentative style shared by Greeks and Jews alike and thus, in Downey's words, exemplifying an intracultural clash between Paul the Jew and Jewish leaders opposing the propagation of Gospel ideas in both Judea and Thessalonia.\nEpistle to the Hebrews.\nMost scholars consider the Epistle to the Hebrews to have been written for Christians who were tempted to return to Judaism. Lillian Freudmann thinks that it in trying to argue the superiority of Christianity to Judaism, it twisted Old Testament passages in a way that transmitted an anti-Torah antisemitism. John Gager reads it as a polemic against Judaism, not the Jewish people, and regards it as the most important anti-Judaizing text of early Christianity. Samuel Sandmel says that rather than vilifying Judaism, or the Jews of that age, the Epistle to the Hebrews is an argument for the supersessionist notion that Christianity is the pinnacle of ancient Judaism. William L. Lane dismissed the idea that it contains an anti-Judaic polemic, its primary concern being simply to say that the Old Testament prophecies had been fulfilled. Those who see in its discontinuities antisemitism are wrong William Hagner said: there may be anti-Judaism, but no antagonism for Jews. While it promotes supersessionism it venerates the Hebrew saints, for Donald Bloesch, and therefore what it is exhorting is the replacement of Jewish institutions, not Jews. For Timothy Johnson, Christianity had to struggle to survive amid a majority of sects that were not Messianic, and whatever slander there is, is to be understood as the rhetoric of a marginal group against the majority of Jews. Such rhetorical vehemence was common in antiquity in religious and philosophical disputes.\nBook of Revelation.\nIn Revelation 2:9 and 3:9, Jesus makes reference to a \"synagogue of Satan\" (\u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03b3\u03ae \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03a3\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u1fb6). Revelation 2:9 states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I know your tribulation and your poverty (but you are rich) and \"the slander of those who say that they are Jews and are not,\" but are a synagogue of Satan.\nAt 3:9 one reads:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan, \"who say that they are Jews and are not,\" but lie--behold, I will make them come and bow down before your feet, and learn that I have loved you.\nThere is no certainty about who are those claiming falsely to be Jews: whether they are Jews hostile to gentiles, Jewish Christians persecuted by a Jewish majority, Jews who are practicing a \"false\" form of Judaism or gentiles feigning to be Jews.\nThe traditional interpretation upheld until recently by a majority of scholars took this to denote Jews hostile to Christians, and specifically to the Jewish communities of Smyrna (2:9) and Philadelphia (3:9). In the Smyrna passage, according to Koester, those claiming to be Jews probably bore in their traits the usual markers of kinship, circumcision, dietary restriction and Sabbath observance, but are taken to task for denouncing the Christian community to the Roman authorities to get them arrested.\nThis has recently been questioned by Elaine Pagels, David Frankfurter, Heinrich Kraft and John W. Marshall. Pagels, reviewing the literature, says that the author of Revelation, John of Patmos, saw himself as a Jew, not a Christian. Unlike the other evangelists who blame Jews for Christ's death, the author of Revelation, drawing on old patterns of late Jewish eschatological imagery, assigns responsibility for his death to Romans and says they are abetted by an internal enemy who feign to be God's people while acting as agents of Satan, a theme also present in the literature of the Qumran sectaries. Pagels identifies most of these internal enemies as converts to the Pauline doctrine and teachings prevailing among gentiles. Taken literally the passage at Revelations 3:9 would refer to gentiles upstaging Jewish followers of Jesus, feigning to be more Jewish than Jews themselves. Paul Duff on the other hand assumes they are Jews, like John himself, but Jews who are hostile to the Jesus movement. David Frankfurter has revived the old argument of Ferdinand Baur by endorsing the view that in fact the members of Satan's synagogue are mostly gentiles, claiming Israel's legacy while rebuffing religious practices that are obligatory for Jews. Even those who, like David Aune, consider that the phrase indicates Jews, not gentiles, allow that the Book of Revelation is virtually devoid of traces of the polemics between Christians and Jews typical of those times. Pagels concludes that the evidence weighs in favour of reading the 'synagogue of Satan' as referring to gentile converts to the Pauline version of the Jesus movement, who denominate themselves as 'those of Christ/Christians', a terminology never used by John of Patmos.\nIt has been said that the idea of a Jewish Antichrist developed from these verses.\nModern responses.\nIn the decree \"Nostra aetate\" in 1965, Pope Paul VI declared that \nTrue, the Jewish authorities and those who followed their lead pressed for the death of Christ; still, what happened in His passion cannot be charged against all the Jews, without distinction, then alive, nor against the Jews of today. Although the Church is the new people of God, the Jews should not be presented as rejected or accursed by God, as if this followed from the Holy Scriptures.\nNorman A. Beck, professor of theology and classical languages at Texas Lutheran University, has proposed that Christian lectionaries remove what he calls \"\u2026 the specific texts identified as most problematic \u2026\". Beck identifies what he deems to be offensive passages in the New Testament and indicates the instances in which these texts or portions thereof are included in major lectionary series.\nDaniel Goldhagen, former associate professor of Political Science at Harvard University, also suggested in his book \"A Moral Reckoning\" that the Roman Catholic Church should change its doctrine and the accepted Biblical canon to excise statements he labels as antisemitic \u2013 he counts some 450 such passages in the Synoptic Gospels and Acts of the Apostles alone \u2013 to indicate that \"The Jews' way to God is as legitimate as the Christian way\".\nThe Church of England Faith and Order Commission document \"God's Unfailing Word: Theological and Practical Perspectives on Christian-Jewish Relations\" addresses the matter of New Testament texts and connection to antisemitism: \"Varying theological emphases within the Church of England regarding the doctrine of scriptural interpretation and authority may have a bearing on how such concerns are addressed.\"\nJames Dunn has said that the New Testament contributed toward subsequent antisemitism in the Christian community.\nAcademic views.\nA. Roy Eckardt, a writer in the field of Jewish-Christian relations, said that the foundation of antisemitism and responsibility for the Holocaust lies ultimately in the New Testament. Eckardt insisted that Christian repentance must include a reexamination of basic theological attitudes toward Jews and the New Testament in order to deal effectively with antisemitism.\nAccording to Louis Feldman, the term \"antisemitism\" is an \"absurdity which the Jews took over from the Germans.\" He thinks the proper term is anti-Judaism. The distinction between anti-Judaism and antisemitism is often made, or challenged, with regard to early Christian hostility to Jews: some, notably Gavin I. Langmuir, prefer anti-Judaism, which implies a theological enmity. They say that the concept of antisemitism \"makes little sense\" in the nascent days of the Christian religion and that it would not emerge until later. In this context, the term antisemitism implies the secular biological race theories of modern times. Amy-Jill Levine says that the New Testament is not antisemitic based on the usual definitions of the term, and to what extent the New Testament is anti-Jewish remains debated, though it has historically been interpreted as such. Peter Sch\u00e4fer prefers the word Judaeophobia for pagan hostility to Jews, but considers the word antisemitism, even if anachronistic, synonymous with this term, while adding that Christian anti-Judaism eventually was crucial to what later became antisemitism. Dunn says that the various New Testament expressions of anger and hurt by a minority puzzled by the refusal of a majority to accept their claims about Jesus the Jew reflect inner tensions between Jewish communities not yet unified by rabbinical Judaism, and a Christianity not yet detached from Judaism. The Greek word \"Ioudaioi\" (Ancient Greek: \"\u1f38\u03bf\u03c5\u03b4\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9\") used throughout the New Testament translates to \"Jews\", more specifically to \"Judeans\". The term \"Hellenistes\" (Greek: \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c2) refers to the Hellenized Jews.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The missile, powered by a liquid-propellant rocket engine, was developed during the Second World War in Nazi Germany as a \"vengeance weapon\" and assigned to attack Allied cities as retaliation for the Allied bombings of German cities. The V2 rocket also became the first artificial object to travel into space by crossing the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line (edge of space) with the vertical launch of MW 18014 on 20 June 1944.\nResearch of military use of long-range rockets began when the graduate studies of Wernher von Braun were noticed by the German Army. A series of prototypes culminated in the A4, which went to war as the V2. Beginning in September 1944, more than 3,000 V2s were launched by the Wehrmacht against Allied targets, first London and later Antwerp and Li\u00e8ge. According to a 2011 BBC documentary, the attacks from V-2s resulted in the deaths of an estimated 9,000 civilians and military personnel, while a further 12,000 laborers and concentration camp prisoners died as a result of their forced participation in the production of the weapons.\nThe rockets traveled at supersonic speeds, impacted without audible warning, and proved unstoppable. No effective defense existed. Teams from the Allied forces\u2014the United States, the United Kingdom, France and the Soviet Union\u2014raced to seize major German manufacturing facilities, procure the Germans' missile technology, and capture the V-2s' launching sites. Von Braun and more than 100 core R&amp;D V-2 personnel surrendered to the Americans, and many of the original V-2 team transferred their work to the Redstone Arsenal, where they were relocated as part of Operation Paperclip. The US also captured enough V-2 hardware to build approximately 80 of the missiles. The Soviets gained possession of the V-2 manufacturing facilities after the war, re-established V-2 production, and moved it to the Soviet Union.\nDevelopment history.\nDuring the late 1920s, a young Wernher von Braun bought a copy of Hermann Oberth's book, \"Die Rakete zu den Planetenr\u00e4umen\" (\"The Rocket into Interplanetary Spaces\"). In 1928 a \"Raketenrummel\" or \"Rocket Rumble\" fad in the popular media was initiated by Fritz von Opel and Max Valier, a collaborator of Oberth, by experimenting with rockets, including public demonstrations of manned rocket cars and rocket planes. The \u201cRocket Rumble\u201d was highly influential on von Braun as a teenage space enthusiast. He was so enthusiastic after seeing one of the public Opel-RAK rocket car demonstrations, that he constructed and launched his own homemade toy rocket car on a crowded sidewalk and was later taken in for questioning by the local police, until released to his father for disciplinary action.\nStarting in 1930, von Braun attended the Technische Hochschule in Charlottenburg (now Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin), where he assisted Oberth in liquid-fueled rocket motor tests. Von Braun was working on his doctorate when the Nazi Party gained power in Germany. An artillery captain, Walter Dornberger, arranged an Ordnance Department research grant for von Braun, who from then on worked next to Dornberger's existing solid-fuel rocket test site at Kummersdorf. Von Braun's thesis, \"Construction, Theoretical, and Experimental Solution to the Problem of the Liquid Propellant Rocket\" (dated 16 April 1934), was kept classified by the German Army and was not published until 1960. By the end of 1934 his group had launched multiple rockets, two of which reached heights of , respectively.\nAt the time, many Germans were interested in American physicist Robert H. Goddard's research. Before 1939, German engineers and scientists occasionally contacted Goddard directly with technical questions. Von Braun used Goddard's plans from various journals and incorporated them into the building of the \"Aggregate\" (A) series of rockets, named for the German word for mechanism or mechanical system.\nAfter successes at Kummersdorf with the first two Aggregate series rockets, Braun and Walter Riedel began thinking of a much larger rocket in the summer of 1936, based on a projected thrust engine. In addition, Dornberger specified the military requirements needed to include a 1-ton payload, a range of 172 miles with a dispersion of 2 or 3 miles, and transportable using road vehicles.\nAfter the A-4 project was postponed due to unfavorable aerodynamic stability testing of the A-3 in July 1936,\nBraun specified the A-4 performance in 1937, and, after an \"extensive\" series of test firings of the A-5 scale test model, using a motor redesigned from the troublesome A-3 by Walter Thiel, A-4 design and construction was ordered c. 1938\u201339. During 28\u201330 September 1939, (English: \"The Day of Wisdom\") conference met at Peenem\u00fcnde to initiate the funding of university research to solve rocket problems.\nBy late 1941, the Army Research Center at Peenem\u00fcnde possessed the technologies essential to the success of the A-4. The four main technologies for the A-4 were large liquid-fuel rocket engines, supersonic aerodynamics, gyroscopic guidance and rudders in jet control. At the time, Adolf Hitler was not particularly impressed by the V-2; he opined that it was merely an artillery shell with a longer range and much higher cost.\nDuring early September 1943, Braun promised the Long-Range Bombardment Commission that the A-4 development was \"practically complete/concluded\", but even by the middle of 1944, a complete A-4 parts list was still unavailable. Hitler was sufficiently impressed by the enthusiasm of its developers, and needed a \"wonder weapon\" to maintain German morale, so he authorized its deployment in large numbers.\nThe V-2s were constructed at the Mittelwerk site by prisoners from Mittelbau-Dora, a concentration camp where 20,000 prisoners died.\nIn 1943, an Austrian resistance group led by Heinrich Maier managed to send exact drawings of the V-2 rocket to the American Office of Strategic Services. Location sketches of V-rocket manufacturing facilities, such as those in Peenem\u00fcnde, were also sent to the Allied general staff in order to enable Allied bombers to perform airstrikes. This information was particularly important for Operation Crossbow and Operation Hydra, both preliminary missions for Operation Overlord. The group was gradually captured by the Gestapo and most of the members were executed.\nTechnical details.\nThe A4 used a 75% ethanol/25% water mixture (\"B-Stoff\") for fuel and liquid oxygen (LOX) (\"A-Stoff\") for oxidizer. The water reduced the flame temperature, acted as a coolant by turning to steam, augmented thrust, tended to produce a smoother burn, and reduced thermal stress.\nRudolf Hermann's supersonic wind tunnel was used to measure the A4's aerodynamic characteristics and center of pressure, using a model of the A4 within a 40 square centimeter chamber. Measurements were made using a Mach 1.86 blowdown nozzle on 8 August 1940. Tests at Mach numbers 1.56 and 2.5 were made after 24 September 1940.\nAt launch the A4 propelled itself for up to 65 seconds on its own power, and a program motor held the inclination at the specified angle until engine shutdown, after which the rocket continued on a ballistic free-fall trajectory. The rocket reached a height of or 264,000\u00a0ft after shutting off the engine.\nThe fuel and oxidizer pumps were driven by a steam turbine, fueled by decomposition of concentrated hydrogen peroxide (T-Stoff) facilitated by a sodium permanganate (Z-Stoff) catalyst. Both the alcohol and oxygen tanks were an aluminum-magnesium alloy.\nThe turbopump, rotating at 4,000 rpm, forced the fuel mixture and oxygen into the combustion chamber at 125 liters (33 US gallons) per second, where they were ignited by a spinning electrical igniter. The engine produced 8 tons of thrust during the preliminary stage whilst the fuel was gravity-fed, before increasing to 25 tons as the turbopump pressurised the fuel, lifting the 13.5 ton rocket. Combustion gases exited the chamber at , and a speed of per second. The oxygen to fuel mixture was 1.0:0.85 at 25 tons of thrust; as ambient pressure decreased with flight altitude, thrust increased to 29 tons. The turbopump assembly contained two centrifugal pumps, one for the fuel mixture, and one for the oxygen. The turbine was connected directly by a shaft to the alcohol pump and through a flexible joint and shaft to the oxygen pump. The turbopump delivered of alcohol and of liquid oxygen per second to a combustion chamber at .\nDr. Thiel's 25 ton rocket motor design relied on pump feeding, as opposed to earlier pressure-fed designs. The motor used centrifugal injection, and used both regenerative cooling and film cooling. Film cooling admitted alcohol into the combustion chamber and exhaust nozzle under slight pressure through four rings of small perforations. The mushroom-shaped injection head was removed from the combustion chamber to a mixing chamber, the combustion chamber was made more spherical while being shortened from 6 to 1-foot in length, and the connection to the nozzle was made cone shaped. The resultant 1.5 ton chamber operated at a combustion pressure of . Thiel's 1.5 ton chamber was then scaled up to a 4.5 ton motor by arranging three injection heads above the combustion chamber. By 1939, eighteen injection heads in two concentric circles at the head of the thick sheet-steel chamber, were used to make the 25 ton motor.\nThe warhead was a source of trouble. The explosive used was amatol 60/40 detonated by an electric contact fuze. Amatol had the advantage of stability, and the warhead was protected by a thick layer of glass wool, but even so it could still explode during the re-entry phase. The warhead weighed and contained of explosive. The warhead's explosive percentage by weight was 93%, a very high portion compared to other types of munitions.\nA protective layer of glass wool was also used for the fuel tanks to prevent the A-4 from forming ice, a problem which plagued other early ballistic missiles such as the balloon tank-design SM-65 Atlas which entered US service in 1959. The tanks held of ethyl alcohol and of oxygen.\nThe V-2 was guided by four external rudders on the tail fins, and four internal graphite vanes in the jet stream at the exit of the motor. These 8 control surfaces were controlled by Helmut H\u00f6lzer's analog computer, the , via electrical-hydraulic servomotors, based on electrical signals from the gyros. The Siemens \"Vertikant\" LEV-3 guidance system consisted of two free gyroscopes (a horizontal for pitch and a vertical with two degrees of freedom for yaw and roll) for lateral stabilization, coupled with a PIGA accelerometer, or the Walter Wolman radio control system, to control engine cutoff at a specified velocity. Other gyroscopic systems used in the A-4 included Kreiselger\u00e4te's SG-66 and SG-70. The V-2 was launched from a pre-surveyed location, so the distance and azimuth to the target were known. Fin 1 of the missile was aligned to the target azimuth.\nSome later V-2s used \"guide beams\", radio signals transmitted from the ground, as an added input to the Mischger\u00e4t analog computer to keep the missile on course in azimuth. The flying distance was controlled by the timing of the engine cut-off, \"Brennschluss\", ground-controlled by a Doppler system or by different types of on-board integrating accelerometers. Thus, range was a function of engine burn time, which ended when a specific velocity was achieved. Just before engine cutoff, thrust was reduced to eight tons, in an effort to avoid any water hammer problems a rapid cutoff could cause.\nDr. Friedrich Kirchstein of Siemens of Berlin developed the V-2 radio control for motor cutoff (). For velocity measurement, Professor Wolman of Dresden created an alternative of his Doppler tracking system in 1940\u201341, which used a ground signal transponded by the A-4 to measure the velocity of the missile. By 9 February 1942, Peenem\u00fcnde engineer Gerd deBeek had documented the radio interference area of a V-2 as around the \"Firing Point\", and the first successful A-4 flight on 3 October 1942 used radio control to command motor cutoff. Although Hitler commented on 22 September 1943 that \"It is a great load off our minds that we have dispensed with the radio guiding-beam; now no opening remains for the British to interfere technically with the missile in flight\", about 20% of the operational V-2 launches were beam-guided. The Operation Pinguin V-2 offensive began on 8 September 1944, when (English: 'Training and Testing Battery 444') launched a single rocket guided by a radio beam directed at Paris. Wreckage of combat V-2s occasionally contained the transponder for velocity and fuel cutoff.\nThe painting of the operational V-2s was mostly a ragged-edged pattern with several variations, but at the end of the war a plain olive green rocket was also used. During tests the rocket was painted in a characteristic black-and-white chessboard pattern, which aided in determining if the rocket was spinning around its longitudinal axis.\nThe original German designation of the rocket was \"V2\", unhyphenated \u2013 exactly as used for any Third Reich-era \"second prototype\" example of an RLM-registered German aircraft design \u2013 but U.S. publications such as \"Life\" magazine were using the hyphenated form \"V-2\" as early as December 1944.\nTesting.\nThe first successful test flight was on 3 October 1942, reaching an altitude of . On that day, Walter Dornberger declared in a meeting at Peenem\u00fcnde:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTwo test launches were recovered by the Allies: the B\u00e4ckebo rocket, the remnants of which landed in Sweden on 13 June 1944, and one recovered by the Polish resistance on 30 May 1944 from the Blizna V-2 missile launch site and transported to the UK during Operation Most III. The highest altitude reached during the war was (20 June 1944). Test launches of V-2 rockets were made at Peenem\u00fcnde, Blizna and Tuchola Forest, and after the war, at Cuxhaven by the British, White Sands Proving Grounds and Cape Canaveral by the U.S., and Kapustin Yar by the USSR.\nVarious design issues were identified and solved during V-2 development and testing:\nAir burst problem.\nThrough mid-March 1944, only four of the 26 successful Blizna launches had satisfactorily reached the Sarnaki target area due to in-flight breakup () on re-entry into the atmosphere. (As mentioned above, one rocket was collected by the Polish Home Army, with parts of it transported to London for tests.) Initially, the German developers suspected excessive alcohol tank pressure, but by April 1944, after five months of test firings, the cause was still not determined. Major-General Rossmann, the Army Weapons Office department chief, recommended stationing observers in the target area \u2013 c. May/June, Dornberger and von Braun set up a camp at the centre of the Poland target zone. After moving to the Heidekraut, SS Mortar Battery 500 of the 836th Artillery Battalion (Motorized) was ordered on 30 August to begin test launches of eighty 'sleeved' rockets. Testing confirmed that the so-called 'tin trousers' \u2013 a tube designed to strengthen the forward end of the rocket cladding \u2013 reduced the likelihood of air bursts.\nProduction.\nOn 27 March 1942, Dornberger proposed production plans and the building of a launching site on the Channel coast. In December, Speer ordered Major Thom and Dr. Steinhoff to reconnoitre the site near Watten. Assembly rooms were established at Peenem\u00fcnde and in the Friedrichshafen facilities of Zeppelin Works. In 1943, a third factory, Raxwerke, was added.\nOn 22 December 1942, Hitler signed the order for mass production, when Albert Speer assumed final technical data would be ready by July 1943. However, many issues still remained to be solved even by the autumn of 1943.\nOn 8 January 1943, Dornberger and von Braun met with Speer. Speer stated, \"As head of the Todt organisation I will take it on myself to start at once with the building of the launching site on the Channel coast,\" and established an A-4 production committee under Degenkolb.\nOn 26 May 1943, the Long-Range Bombardment Commission, chaired by AEG director Petersen, met at Peenem\u00fcnde to review the V-1 and V-2 automatic long-range weapons. In attendance were Speer, Air Marshal Erhard Milch, Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz, Col. General Friedrich Fromm, and Karl Saur. Both weapons had reached the final stage of development, and the commission decided to recommend to Hitler that both weapons be mass-produced. As Dornberger observed, \"The disadvantages of the one would be compensated by the other's advantages.\"\nOn 7 July 1943, Major General Dornberger, von Braun, and Dr. Steinhof briefed Hitler in his Wolf's Lair. Also in attendance were Speer, Wilhelm Keitel, and Alfred Jodl. The briefing included von Braun narrating a movie showing the successful launch on 3 October 1942, with scale models of the Channel coast firing bunker, and supporting vehicles, including the . Hitler then gave Peenem\u00fcnde top priority in the German armaments program stating, \"Why was it I could not believe in the success of your work? if we had had these rockets in 1939 we should never have had this war...\" Hitler also wanted a second launch bunker built.\nSaur planned to build 2,000 rockets per month, between the existing three factories and the Nordhausen Mittelwerk factory being built. However, alcohol production was dependent upon the potato harvest.\nA production line was nearly ready at Peenem\u00fcnde when the Operation Hydra attack occurred. The main targets of the attack included the test stands, the development works, the Pre-Production Works, the settlement where the scientists and technicians lived, the Trassenheide camp, and the harbor sector. According to Dornberger, \"Serious damage to the works, contrary to first impressions, was surprisingly small.\" Work resumed after a delay of four to six weeks, and because of camouflage to mimic complete destruction, there were no more raids during the next nine months. The raid resulted in 735 lives lost, with heavy losses at Trassenheide, while 178 were killed in the settlement, including Dr. Thiel, his family, and Chief Engineer Walther. The Germans eventually moved production to the underground \"Mittelwerk\" in the Kohnstein where 5,200 V-2 rockets were built with the use of forced labour.\nLaunch sites.\nAfter the Operation Crossbow bombing, initial plans for launching from the massive underground Watten, Wizernes and Sottevast bunkers or from fixed pads such as near the Ch\u00e2teau du Molay were dismissed in favour of mobile launching. Eight main storage dumps were planned and four had been completed by July 1944 (the one at Mery-sur-Oise was begun during August 1943 and completed by February 1944). The missile could be launched practically anywhere, roads running through forests being a particular favourite. The system was so mobile and small that only one was ever caught in action by Allied aircraft, during the Operation Bodenplatte attack on 1 January 1945 near Lochem by a USAAF 4th Fighter Group aircraft, although Raymond Baxter described flying over a site during a launch and his wingman firing at the missile without hitting it.\nIt was estimated that a sustained rate of 350 V-2s could be launched per week, with 100 per day at maximum effort, given sufficient supply of the rockets.\nOperational history.\nThe LXV \"Armeekorps\" z.b.V. formed during the last days of November 1943 in France commanded by \"General der Artillerie\" z.V. Erich Heinemann was responsible for the operational use of V-2. Three launch battalions were formed in late 1943, \"Artillerie Abteilung\" 836 (Mot.), Grossborn, Artillerie Abteilung 485 (Mot.), Naugard, and \"Artillerie Abteilung\" 962 (\"Mot.\"). Combat operations commenced in Sept. 1944, when training Batterie 444 deployed. On 2 September 1944, the SS \"Werfer-Abteilung\" 500 was formed, and by October, the SS under the command of SS Lt. Gen Hans Kammler, took operational control of all units. He formed \"Gruppe S\u00fcd\" with Art. Abt. 836, Merzig, and \"Gruppe Nord\" with Art. Abt. 485 and \"Batterie\" 444, Burgsteinfurt and The Hague.\nAfter Hitler's 29 August 1944 declaration to begin V-2 attacks as soon as possible, the offensive began on 7 September 1944 when two were launched at Paris (which the Allies had liberated less than two weeks earlier), but both crashed soon after launch. On 8 September a single rocket was launched at Paris, which caused modest damage near Porte d'Italie. Two more launches by the 485th followed, including one from The Hague against London on the same day at 6:43\u00a0pm. \u2013 the first landed at Staveley Road, Chiswick, killing 63-year-old Mrs. Ada Harrison, three-year-old Rosemary Clarke, and Sapper Bernard Browning on leave from the Royal Engineers, and one that hit Epping with no casualties.\nThe British government, concerned about spreading panic or giving away vital intelligence to German forces, initially attempted to conceal the cause of the explosions by making no official announcement, and euphemistically blaming them on defective gas mains. The public did not believe this explanation and therefore began referring to the V-2s as \"flying gas mains\". The Germans themselves finally announced the V-2 on 8 November 1944 and only then, on 10 November 1944, did Winston Churchill inform Parliament, and the world, that England had been under rocket attack \"for the last few weeks\".\nIn September 1944, control of the V-2 mission was transferred to the Waffen-SS and Division z.V.\nPositions of the German launch units changed a number of times. For example, \"Artillerie Init 444\" arrived in the southwest Netherlands (in Zeeland) in September 1944. From a field near the village of Serooskerke, five V-2s were launched on 15 and 16 September, with one more successful and one failed launch on the 18th. That same date, a transport carrying a missile took a wrong turn and ended up in Serooskerke itself, giving a villager the opportunity to surreptitiously take some photographs of the weapon; these were smuggled to London by the Dutch Resistance. After that the unit moved to the woods near Rijs, Gaasterland in the northwest Netherlands, to ensure that the technology was not captured by the Allies. From Gaasterland V-2s were launched against Ipswich and Norwich from 25 September (London being out of range). Because of their inaccuracy, these V-2s did not hit their target cities. Soon after that only London and Antwerp remained as designated targets as ordered by Adolf Hitler himself, Antwerp being targeted in the period of 12 to 20 October, after which time the unit moved to The Hague.\nTargets.\nDuring the succeeding months about 3,172 V-2 rockets were fired at the following targets:\nAntwerp, Belgium was a target for a large number of V-weapon attacks from October 1944 through to the virtual end of the war in March 1945, leaving 1,736 dead and 4,500 injured in greater Antwerp. Thousands of buildings were damaged or destroyed as the city was struck by 590 direct hits. Hitler's hope that the Port of Antwerp dock gates would be hit and the port put out of action was not achieved. The largest loss of life by a single rocket attack during the war came on 16 December 1944, when the roof of the crowded Cine Rex was struck, leaving 567 dead and 291 injured.\nAn estimated 2,754 civilians were killed in London by V-2 attacks with another 6,523 injured, which is two people killed per V-2 rocket. The death toll in London did not meet the Nazis' full expectations, during early usage, as they had not yet perfected the accuracy of the V-2, with many rockets being misdirected and exploding harmlessly. Accuracy increased during the war, particularly for batteries where the (radio guide beam) system was used. Missile strikes that did hit targets could cause large numbers of deaths; 160 were killed and 108 seriously injured in one explosion at 12:26\u00a0pm on 25 November 1944, at a Woolworth's department store in New Cross, south-east London.\nBritish intelligence also helped impede the effectiveness of the Nazi weapon, sending false reports via their Double-Cross System implying that the rockets were over-shooting their London target by . This tactic worked; more than half of the V-2s aimed at London landed short of the London Civil Defence Region. Most landed on less-heavily populated areas in Kent due to erroneous recalibration. For the remainder of the war, British intelligence maintained the ruse by repeatedly sending bogus reports implying that these failed rockets were striking the British capital with heavy loss of life.\nPossible use during Operation Bodenplatte.\nAt least one V-2 missile on a mobile \"Meillerwagen\" launch trailer was observed being elevated to launch position by a USAAF 4th Fighter Group pilot defending against the massive New Year's Day 1945 Operation Bodenplatte strike by the Luftwaffe over the northern German attack route near the town of Lochem on 1 January 1945. Possibly, from the potential sighting of the American fighter by the missile's launch crew, the rocket was quickly lowered from a near launch-ready 85\u00b0 elevation to 30\u00b0.\nTactical use on German target.\nAfter the US Army captured the Ludendorff Bridge during the Battle of Remagen on 7 March 1945, the Germans were desperate to destroy it. On 17 March 1945, they fired eleven V-2 missiles at the bridge, their first use against a tactical target and the only time they were fired on a German target during the war. They could not employ the more accurate device because it was oriented towards Antwerp and could not be easily adjusted for another target. Fired from near Hellendoorn, the Netherlands, one of the missiles landed as far away as Cologne, to the north, while one missed the bridge by only . They also struck the town of Remagen, destroying a number of buildings and killing at least six American soldiers.\nFinal use.\nThe final two rockets exploded on 27 March 1945. One of these was the last V-2 to kill a British civilian and the final civilian casualty of the war on British soil: Ivy Millichamp, aged 34, killed in her home in Kynaston Road, Orpington in Kent. A scientific reconstruction performed in 2010 demonstrated that the V-2 creates a crater wide and deep, ejecting approximately 3,000 tons of material into the air.\nCountermeasures.\nBig Ben and Operation Crossbow.\nUnlike the V-1, the V-2's speed and trajectory made it practically invulnerable to anti-aircraft guns and fighters, as it dropped from an altitude of at up to three times the speed of sound at sea level (approximately ). Nevertheless, the threat of what was then code-named \"Big Ben\" was great enough that efforts were made to seek countermeasures. The situation was similar to the pre-war concerns about manned bombers and resulted in a similar solution, the formation of the Crossbow Committee, to collect, examine and develop countermeasures.\nEarly on, it was believed that the V-2 employed some form of radio guidance, a belief that persisted in spite of several rockets being examined without discovering anything like a radio receiver. This resulted in efforts to jam this non-existent guidance system as early as September 1944, using both ground and air-based jammers flying over the UK. In October, a group had been sent to jam the missiles during launch. By December it was clear these systems were not having any obvious effect, and jamming efforts ended.\nAnti-aircraft gun system (proposed).\nGeneral Frederick Alfred Pile, commander of Anti-Aircraft Command, studied the problem and proposed that enough anti-aircraft guns were available to produce a barrage of fire in the rocket's path, but only if provided with a reasonable prediction of the trajectory. The first estimates suggested that 320,000 shells would have to be fired for each rocket. About 2% of these were expected to fall back to the ground unexploded containing almost 90 tons of explosives, which would cause far more damage than the missile. At a 25 August 1944 meeting of the Crossbow Committee, the concept was rejected.\nPile continued studying the problem and returned with a proposal to fire only 150 shells at a single rocket, with those shells using a new fuse that would greatly reduce the number that fell back to Earth unexploded. Some low-level analysis suggested that this would be successful against 1 in 50 rockets, provided that accurate trajectories were forwarded to the gunners in time. Work on this basic concept continued and developed into a plan to deploy a large number of guns in Hyde Park that were provided with pre-configured firing data for grids of the London area. After the trajectory was determined, the guns would aim and fire between 60 and 500 rounds.\nAt a Crossbow meeting on 15 January 1945 Pile's updated plan was presented with some strong advocacy from Roderic Hill and Charles Drummond Ellis. However, the Committee suggested that a test not be performed as no technique for tracking the missiles with sufficient accuracy had yet been developed. By March this had changed significantly, with 81% of incoming missiles correctly allotted to the grid square each fell into, or the one beside it. At a 26 March meeting Pile was directed to a subcommittee with RV Jones and Ellis to further develop the statistics. Three days later the team returned a report stating that if the guns fired 2,000 rounds at a missile there was a 1 in 60 chance of shooting it down. Plans for an operational test began, but as Pile later put it, \"Monty beat us to it\", as the attacks ended with the Allied capture of their launching areas.\nWith the Germans no longer in control of any part of the continent that could be used as a launching site capable of striking London, they began targeting Antwerp. Plans were made to move the Pile system to protect that city, but the war ended before anything could be done.\nDirect attack and disinformation.\nThe only effective defences against the V-2 campaign were to destroy the launch infrastructure\u2014expensive in terms of bomber resources and casualties\u2014or to cause the Germans to aim at the wrong place by disinformation. The British were able to convince the Germans to direct V-1s and V-2s aimed at London to less populated areas east of the city. This was done by sending deceptive reports on the sites hit and damage caused via the German espionage network in Britain, which was secretly controlled by the British (the Double-Cross System).\nAccording to the BBC television presenter Raymond Baxter, who served with the RAF during the war, in February 1945 his squadron was performing a mission against a V2 launch site, when they saw one missile being launched. One member of Baxter's squadron opened fire on it, without effect.\nOn 3 March 1945, the Allies attempted to destroy V-2s and launching equipment in the \"Haagse Bos\" in The Hague by a large-scale bombardment, but due to navigational errors the Bezuidenhout quarter was destroyed, killing 511 Dutch civilians.\nAssessment.\nThe German V-weapons (V-1 and V-2) cost the equivalent of about US$500 million. Given the relatively smaller size of the German economy, this represented an industrial effort equivalent to but slightly less than that of the U.S. Manhattan Project that produced the atomic bomb. 6,048 V-2s were built, at a cost of approximately 100,000\u00a0\u211b\ufe01\u2133\ufe01 (\u00a3 in 2011) each; 3,225 were launched.\nSS General Hans Kammler, who as an engineer had constructed several concentration camps including Auschwitz, had a reputation for brutality and had originated the idea of using concentration camp prisoners as slave laborers for the rocket program. More people died manufacturing the V-2 than were killed by its deployment.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n... those of us who were seriously engaged in the war were very grateful to Wernher von Braun. We knew that each V-2 cost as much to produce as a high-performance fighter airplane. We knew that German forces on the fighting fronts were in desperate need of airplanes, and that the V-2 rockets were doing us no military damage. From our point of view, the V-2 program was almost as good as if Hitler had adopted a policy of unilateral disarmament.\nFreeman Dyson\nThe V-2 consumed a third of Germany's fuel alcohol production and major portions of other critical technologies. Due to a lack of explosives, some warheads were simply filled with concrete, using the kinetic energy alone for destruction, and sometimes the warhead contained photographic propaganda of German citizens who had died in Allied bombings.\nThe psychological effect of the V-2 was considerable, as the V-2, traveling faster than the speed of sound, gave no warning before impact (unlike bombing planes or the V-1 flying bomb, which made a characteristic buzzing sound). There was no effective defence and no risk of pilot or crew casualties. An example of the impression it made is in the reaction of American pilot and future nuclear strategist and Congressional aide William Liscum Borden, who in November 1944 while returning from a nighttime air mission over Holland saw a V-2 in flight on its way to strike London: \"It resembled a meteor, streaming red sparks and whizzing past us as though the aircraft were motionless. I became convinced that it was only a matter of time until rockets would expose the United States to direct, transoceanic attack.\"\nWith the war all but lost, regardless of the factory output of conventional weapons, the Nazis resorted to V-weapons as a tenuous last hope to influence the war militarily (hence Antwerp as V-2 target), as an extension of their desire to \"punish\" their foes and most importantly to give hope to their sympathizers with their miracle weapon. The V-2 did not affect the outcome of the war, but it resulted in the development of the intercontinental ballistic missiles of the Cold War, which were also used for space exploration.\nUnfulfilled plans.\nA submarine-towed launch platform was tested successfully, making it the prototype for submarine-launched ballistic missiles. The project codename was (\"Test stand XII\"), sometimes termed the rocket U-boat. If deployed, it would have allowed a U-boat to launch V-2 missiles against United States cities, though only with considerable effort (and limited effect). Hitler, in July 1944, and Speer, in January 1945, made speeches alluding to the scheme, though Germany did not possess the capability to fulfill these threats. \nWhile interned after the war by the British at CSDIC camp 11, Dornberger was recorded saying that he had begged the F\u00fchrer to stop the V-weapon propaganda, because nothing more could be expected from one ton of explosive. To this Hitler had replied that \"Dornberger\" might not expect more, but \"he\" (Hitler) certainly did.\nAccording to decrypted messages from the Japanese embassy in Germany, twelve dismantled V-2 rockets were shipped to Japan. These left Bordeaux in August 1944 on the transport U-boats and , which reached Jakarta in December 1944. A civilian V-2 expert was a passenger on \"\", bound for Japan in May 1945 when the war ended in Europe. The fate of these V-2 rockets is unknown.\nPost-war use.\nAt the end of the war, a competition began between the United States and the USSR to retrieve as many V-2 rockets and staff as possible. Three hundred rail-car loads of V-2s and parts were captured and shipped to the United States and 126 of the principal designers, including Wernher von Braun and Walter Dornberger, were captives of the Americans. Von Braun, his brother Magnus von Braun, and seven others decided to surrender to the United States military (Operation Paperclip) to ensure they were not captured by the advancing Soviets or shot dead by the Nazis to prevent their capture.\nAfter the Nazi defeat, German engineers were relocated to the United States, the USSR, France and the United Kingdom where they further developed the V-2 rocket for military and civilian purposes. The V-2 rocket also laid the foundation for the liquid fuel missiles and space launchers used later.\nUnited States.\nOperation Paperclip recruited German engineers and Special Mission V-2 transported the captured V-2 parts to the United States. At the close of the Second World War, more than 300 rail cars filled with V-2 engines, fuselages, propellant tanks, gyroscopes, and associated equipment were brought to the railyards in Las Cruces, New Mexico, so they could be placed on trucks and driven to the White Sands Proving Grounds, also in New Mexico.\nIn addition to V-2 hardware, the U.S. Government delivered German mechanization equations for the V-2 guidance, navigation, and control systems, as well as for advanced development concept vehicles, to U.S. defence contractors for analysis. During the 1950s, some of these documents were useful to U.S. contractors in developing direction cosine matrix transformations and other inertial navigation architecture concepts that were applied to early U.S. programs, such as the Atlas and Minuteman guidance systems as well as the Navy's Subs Inertial Navigation System.\nA committee was formed with military and civilian scientists to review payload proposals for the reassembled V-2 rockets. By January 1946, the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps invited civilian scientists and engineers to participate in developing a space research program using the V-2. The committee was initially named the \"V2 Rocket Panel\", then the \"V2 Upper Atmosphere Research Panel\", and finally the \"Upper Atmosphere Rocket Research Panel\". This resulted in an eclectic array of experiments that flew on V-2s and helped prepare for American manned space exploration. Devices were sent aloft to sample the air at all levels to determine atmospheric pressures and to see what gases were present. Other instruments measured the level of cosmic radiation.\nOnly 68 percent of the V-2 trials were considered successful. On 29 May 1947, a Modified V-2 had an error in its guidance, and landed near Juarez, Mexico, causing an international incident.\nThe U.S. Navy attempted to launch a German V-2 rocket at sea\u2014one test launch from the aircraft carrier USS \"Midway\" was performed on 6 September 1947 as part of the Navy's Operation Sandy. The test launch was a partial success; the V-2 went off the pad but splashed down in the ocean only some from the carrier. The launch setup on the Midway's deck is notable in that it used foldaway arms to prevent the missile from falling over. The arms pulled away just after the engine ignited, releasing the missile. The setup may look similar to the R-7 Semyorka launch procedure but in the case of the R-7 the trusses hold the full weight of the rocket, rather than just reacting to side forces.\nThe PGM-11 Redstone rocket is a direct descendant of the V-2.\nUSSR.\nThe USSR captured a number of V-2s and staff, letting them stay in Germany for a time. The first work contracts were signed in the middle of 1945. During October 1946 (as part of Operation Osoaviakhim) they were obliged to relocate to Branch 1 of NII-88 on Gorodomlya Island in Lake Seliger where Helmut Gr\u00f6ttrup directed a group of 150 engineers. In October 1947, a group of German scientists supported the USSR in launching rebuilt V-2s in Kapustin Yar. The German team was indirectly overseen by Sergei Korolev, one of the leaders of the Soviet rocketry program.\nThe first Soviet missile was the R-1, a duplicate of the V-2 manufactured completely in the USSR, which was launched first during October 1948. From 1947 until the end of 1950, the German team elaborated concepts and improvements for extended payload and range for the projects G-1, G-2 and G-4. The German team had to remain on Gorodomlya island until as late as 1952 and 1953. In parallel, Soviet work emphasized larger missiles, the R-2 and R-5, based on further developing the V-2 technology with using ideas of the German concept studies. Details of Soviet achievements were unknown to the German team and completely underestimated by Western intelligence until, in November 1957, the satellite Sputnik 1 was launched successfully to orbit by the Sputnik rocket based on R-7, the world's first intercontinental ballistic missile.\nFrance.\nBetween May and September of 1946, CEPA, the forerunner to today's French space agency CNES, undertook the recruitment of approximately thirty German engineers, who had previous experience working on rocket programs for Nazi Germany at the Peenem\u00fcnde Army Research Center. Much like their counterparts in the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, France's objective was to acquire and advance the rocket technology developed by Germany during World War II. The initial initiative, known as the Super V-2 program, had plans for four rocket variants capable of achieving ranges of up to and carrying warheads weighing up to . However, this program was canceled in 1948.\nFrom 1950 to 1969, the research done on the Super V-2 program was repurposed to develop the V\u00e9ronique sounding rocket, which became the first liquid-fuel research rocket in Western Europe and was ultimately capable of carrying a payload to an altitude of . The V\u00e9ronique program then led to the Diamant rocket and the Ariane rocket family.\nUK.\nDuring October 1945, the Allied Operation Backfire assembled a small number of V-2 missiles and launched three of them from a site in northern Germany. The engineers involved had already agreed to relocate to the US when the test firings were complete. The Backfire report, published in January 1946, contains extensive technical documentation of the rocket, including all support procedures, tailored vehicles and fuel composition.\nIn 1946, the British Interplanetary Society proposed an enlarged man-carrying version of the V-2, named Megaroc. It could have enabled sub-orbital spaceflight similar to, but at least a decade earlier than, the Mercury-Redstone flights of 1961.\nChina.\nThe first Chinese Dongfeng missile, the DF-1 was a licensed copy of the Soviet R-2; this design was produced during the 1960s.\nSurviving V-2 examples and components.\nAt least 20 V-2s still existed during 2014.\nUnited States.\nComplete missiles\nComponents\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "32787", "revid": "33989260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32787", "title": "Vodka", "text": "Clear distilled alcoholic beverage\nVodka ( ; ) is a clear distilled alcoholic beverage. Its varieties originated in Poland and Russia. Vodka is composed mainly of water and ethanol (alcohol), but sometimes with traces of impurities and flavourings. Traditionally, it is made by distilling liquid from fermented cereal grains and potatoes since the latter was introduced in Europe in the 18th century. Some modern brands use maize, sugar cane, fruit, honey, and maple sap as the base.\nSince the 1890s, standard vodkas have been 40% alcohol by volume (ABV) (80 U.S. proof). The European Union has established a minimum alcohol content of 37.5% for vodka. Vodka in the United States must have a minimum alcohol content of 40%.\nVodka is traditionally drunk \"neat\" (not mixed with water, ice, or other mixers), and it is often served freezer chilled in the so-called \"vodka belt\" of Belarus, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Russia, Sweden, and Ukraine. It is also used in cocktails and mixed drinks, such as the vodka martini, Cosmopolitan, vodka tonic, screwdriver, greyhound, Black or White Russian, Moscow mule, Bloody Mary, Caesar and Red Bull Vodka.\nSince 1960s, the unflavoured Swedish \"br\u00e4nnvin\" also came to be called vodka.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"vodka\" is a diminutive of the Slavic word \"voda\" 'water' (literally, 'little water'): root \"vod\"- [water] + -\"k\"- (diminutive suffix, among other functions) + -\"a\" (ending of feminine gender).\nIn English literature, the word \"vodka\" appeared around the late 18th century. In a book of travels published in English in 1780 (presumably, a translation from German), Johann Gottlieb Georgi correctly explained that \"\"kabak\" in the Russian language signifies a public house for the common people to drink \"vodka\" (a sort of brandy) in\". In 1799, William Tooke glossed \"vodka\" as \"rectified corn-spirits\", using the traditional English sense of the word \"corn\" to refer to any grain, not just maize. In 1800, the French poet Th\u00e9ophile Gautier glossed it as a \"grain liquor\" served with meals in Poland (\" de grain\").\nAnother possible connection of \"vodka\" with water is the name of the medieval alcoholic beverage \"aqua vitae\" (Latin, literally, 'water of life'), which is reflected in Polish , Ukrainian , Belarusian , and Scandinavian \"akvavit\". Whiskey has a similar etymology, from Irish and Scottish Gaelic \"uisce beatha / uisge-beatha\".\nPeople in the area of vodka's probable origin have names for vodka with roots meaning 'to burn': ; ; ; ; is also in use, colloquially and in proverbs; ; . In Russian during the 17th and 18th centuries, (\"goryashchee vino\" 'burning wine' or 'hot wine') was widely used. Others languages include German \"Branntwein\", Danish \"br\u00e6ndevin\", , , and (although the latter terms refer to any strong alcoholic beverage).\nHistory.\nScholars debate the beginnings of vodka because there is little historical material available. For many centuries, beverages differed significantly compared to the vodka of today, as the spirit at that time had a different flavor, color, and smell, and was originally used as medicine. It contained little alcohol, an estimated maximum of about 14%. Distillation techniques were developed in Roman Egypt by the 3rd century, but the description of \"aqua ardens\" (\"burning water\", i.e., alcohol) made by distilling wine with salt appears in Latin works only by the 12th century. The process was well known among European medieval chemists by about 1300.\nPoland.\nThe world's first written mention of the word \"w\u00f3dka\" was in 1405 from \"Akta Grodzkie\" recorder of deeds, in the court documents from the Palatinate of Sandomierz in Poland. At the time, the word \"w\u00f3dka\" referred to chemical compounds such as medicines and cosmetics' cleansers. The production of liquor begins in the mid-15th century, with varied local traditions emerging throughout Europe, in Poland as vodka ( or ). In the 16th century, the Polish word for the beverage was \"gorza\u0142ka\" (from the Old Polish verb \"gorze\u0107\" meaning \"to burn\"), which is also the source of Ukrainian (). The word written in Cyrillic appeared first in 1533, about a medicinal drink brought from Poland to Russia by the Russian merchants.\nIn these early days, the spirits were used mostly as medicines. Stefan Falimierz asserted in his 1534 works on herbs that vodka could serve \"to increase fertility and awaken lust\". \"Wodka lub gorza\u0142ka\" (1614), by Jerzy Pota\u0144ski, contains valuable information on the production of vodka. Jakub Kazimierz Haur, in his book \"Sk\u0142ad albo skarbiec znakomitych sekret\u00f3w ekonomii ziemia\u0144skiej\" (\"A Treasury of Excellent Secrets about Landed Gentry's Economy\", Krak\u00f3w, 1693), gave detailed recipes for making vodka from rye.\nSome Polish vodka blends go back centuries. Most notable are \"\u017bubr\u00f3wka\", from about the 16th century; \"Goldwasser\", from the early 17th century; and aged \"Starka\" vodka, from the 16th century. In the mid-17th century, the \"szlachta\" (nobility of Poland) were granted a monopoly on producing and selling vodka in their territories. This privilege was a source of substantial profits. One of the most famous distilleries of the aristocracy was established by El\u017cbieta Izabela Lubomirska and later operated by her grandson, Alfred Wojciech Potocki. The Vodka Industry Museum, located at the park of the Potocki country estate has an original document attesting that the distillery already existed in 1784. Today, it operates as \"Polmos \u0141a\u0144cut\".\nVodka production on a much larger scale began in Poland at the end of the 16th century, initially at Krak\u00f3w, whence spirits were exported to Silesia before 1550. Silesian cities also bought vodka from Pozna\u0144, a city that in 1580 had 498 working spirits distilleries. Soon, however, Gda\u0144sk outpaced both these cities. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Polish vodka was known in the Netherlands, Denmark, England, Russia, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Romania, Ukraine, Bulgaria and the Black Sea basin.\nEarly production methods were rudimentary. The beverage was usually low-proof, and the distillation process had to be repeated several times (a three-stage distillation process was common). The first distillate was called \"brant\u00f3wka\", the second was \"szum\u00f3wka\", and the third was \"okowita\" (from \"aqua vitae\"), which generally contained 70\u201380% ABV. Then the beverage was watered down, yielding a simple vodka (30\u201335% ABV), or a stronger one if the watering was done using an alembic. The exact production methods were described in 1768 by Jan Pawe\u0142 Biretowski and in 1774 by Jan Chryzostom Pasek. The late 18th century inaugurated the production of vodka from various unusual substances including even the carrot.\nThough there was a substantial vodka cottage industry in Poland back to the 16th century, the end of the 18th century marked the start of real industrial production of vodka in Poland (Kresy, the eastern part of Poland, was part of the Russian Empire at that time). Vodkas produced by the nobility and clergy became a mass product. The first industrial distillery was opened in 1782 in Lw\u00f3w by J. A. Baczewski. He was soon followed by Jakub Haberfeld, who in 1804 established a factory at O\u015bwi\u0119cim, and by Hartwig Kantorowicz, who started producing Wyborowa in 1823 at Pozna\u0144. The implementation of new technologies in the latter half of the 19th century, which allowed the production of clear vodkas, contributed to their success. The first rectification distillery was established in 1871. In 1925, the production of clear vodkas was made a Polish government monopoly.\nAfter World War II, all vodka distilleries were taken over by Poland's Marxist\u2013Leninist government. During the martial law of the 1980s, the sale of vodka was rationed. Following the success of the Solidarity movement and the abolition of single-party rule in Poland, many distilleries began struggling financially. Some filed for bankruptcy, but many were privatized, leading to the creation of various new brands.\nRussia.\nEarly history.\nA type of distilled liquor designated by the Russian word \"vodka\" came to Russia in the late 14th century. In 1386, the Genoese ambassadors brought the first \"aqua vitae\" (\"water of life\") to Moscow and presented it to Grand Prince Dmitry Donskoy. The liquid obtained by distillation of grape must was thought to be a concentrate and a \"spirit\" of wine (\"spiritus vini\" in Latin), whence came to the name of this substance in many European languages (like English spirit, or Russian , ). As the Genoese passed through Moscow and brought with them \"aqua vitae\", Russian monks transformed the practice of distilling wine into vodka production. Another theory is that the practice came to Russia through the trade routes of the Hanseatic League, with the earliest mention of imported wines being in 1436.\nPerhaps one of the earliest terms linked to vodka production was \"varenoe vino\" (\"distilled wine\") which appears in a 1399 document. Another term used was \"perevara\", a precursor to vodka, which last appears in official documents in 1495. The term \"korchma\" is one of the oldest official terms used for vodka, which was used alongside \"varenoe vino\", but later came to denote illegally produced vodka by the 16th century. Other terms that referred to vodka included \"goriachee vino\" (\"burning wine\"), \"zhzhenoe vino\" (\"burnt wine\"), and \"khlebnoe vino\" (\"bread wine\").\nThis \"bread wine\", as it was initially known, was for a long time produced exclusively in the Grand Principality of Moscow and in no other Russian principality (this situation persisted until the era of industrial production). Thus, this beverage was closely associated with Moscow. Ivan III created the first Russian state monopoly on vodka in 1474, and by 1505, the first exports of distilled Russian vodka had arrived in Sweden. \nBy the 16th century, the consumption of vodka was widespread in Russia, with Sigismund von Herberstein stating that nobles at the Russian court \"at the beginning of the meal always drank \"aqua vitae\"\", although Herberstein makes no further mention of the drink. Around the same time, government-run taverns known as kabaks replaced privately-run korchmas. Giles Fletcher, who was the English ambassador in Russia, wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In every great towne of his Realme he hath a \"Caback\" or drinking house, where is sold \"aquavit\u00e6\" (which they call \"Russewine\") \"mead\", \"beere\", \"&amp;c.\" Out of these hee receiveth rent that amounteth to a great summe of money.\u2014\u200a\nRussian Empire.\nUntil the mid-18th century, the drink remained relatively low in alcohol content, not exceeding 40% ABV. Multiple terms for the drink were recorded, sometimes reflecting different levels of quality, alcohol concentration, filtering, and the number of distillations; most commonly, it was referred to as \"burning wine\", \"bread wine\", or even in some locations simply \"wine\". In some locations, grape wine may have been so expensive that it was a drink only for aristocrats. Burning wine was usually diluted with water to 24% ABV or less before drinking. It was mostly sold in taverns and was quite expensive. At the same time, the word \"vodka\" was already in use, but it described herbal tinctures (similar to Nalewka), containing up to 75% ABV, and made for medicinal purposes.\nThe first written usage of the word \"vodka\" in an official Russian document in its modern meaning is dated by the decree of Empress Elizabeth of 8 June 1751, which regulated the ownership of vodka distilleries. By the 1860s, a government policy of promoting the consumption of state-manufactured vodka made it the drink of choice for many Russians. In 1863, the government monopoly on vodka production was repealed, causing prices to plummet and making vodka available even to low-income citizens. The taxes on vodka became a key element of government finances in Tsarist Russia, providing at times up to 40% of state revenue. By 1911, vodka comprised 89% of all alcohol consumed in Russia. This level has fluctuated somewhat during the 20th century but remained quite high at all times. The most recent estimates put it at 70% (2001).\nPost-Soviet Russia.\nVodka remains a major source of state revenue and therefore of power. Seizing control of the state spirits monopoly Rosspirtprom and its Kristall distillery was instrumental for Vladimir Putin to consolidate his power as prime minister and president. Under his rule, the \"Putinka\" (\"little Putin\") brand of vodka became a bestseller, partly to Putin's financial benefit.\nOther popular Russian vodka producers or brands include Stolichnaya and Russian Standard.\nSweden.\nFrom the 1960s, unflavoured Swedish \"br\u00e4nnvin\" also came to be called vodka. The first Swedish product to use this term was Explorer Vodka, which was created in 1958 and initially was intended for the American export market. Although it ultimately failed in that market, it remains one of the most popular vodka brands in Sweden today. In 1979, Absolut Vodka was launched, reusing the name of the old \"Absolut Rent Br\u00e4nnvin\" (\"absolutely pure \"br\u00e4nnvin\"\") created in 1879.\nAfter Sweden joined the European Union in 1995, the regulations were changed so that privately owned companies could produce Vodka.\nVodka has become popular among young people, with a flourishing black market. In 2013, the organizers of the so-called \"vodka car\" were jailed for two and a half years for having illegally provided thousands of liters to young people, some as young as 13.\nProduction.\nVodka may be distilled from any starch- or sugar-rich plant matter; most vodka today is produced from grains such as sorghum, corn, rye, or wheat. Some vodkas are made from potatoes, molasses, soybeans, grapes, rice, sugar beets and sometimes even byproducts of oil refining or wood pulp processing. In some Central European countries, such as Poland, some vodka is produced by just fermenting a solution of crystal sugar and yeast. In the European Union, there are talks about the standardization of vodka, and the Vodka Belt countries insist that only spirits produced from grains, potato, and sugar beet molasses be allowed to be branded as \"vodka\", following the traditional methods of production.\nIn the United States, many vodkas are made from 95% pure grain alcohol produced in large quantities by agricultural-industrial giants Archer Daniels Midland, Grain Processing Corporation, and Midwest Grain Products (MGP). Bottlers purchase the base spirits in bulk, then filter, dilute, distribute and market the end product under a variety of vodka brand names. Similar methods are used in other regions such as Europe.\nThis pure grain alcohol, also known as \"rectified spirit\", \"neutral spirit\", or \"ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin\", is also available directly to consumers in some areas, as products such as Everclear, Polmos \"spirytus rektyfikowany\", and others. In contrast to very high ABV vodkas such as the Bulgarian \"Balkan 176\u00b0\" with 88% ABV, these grain alcohol products are not considered vodka; they have not (yet) gone through the filtration and refining process used to produce vodka.\nA study conducted on NPR's \"Planet Money\" podcast revealed negligible differences in taste between various brands of vodka, leading to speculation as to how much branding contributes to the concept of \"super-premium vodkas\".\nDistilling and filtering.\nA common property of the vodkas produced in the United States and Europe is the extensive use of filtration before any additional processing including the addition of flavorants. Filtering is sometimes done in the still during distillation, as well as afterward, where the distilled vodka is filtered through activated charcoal and other media to absorb trace amounts of substances that alter or impart off-flavors to the vodka. However, this is not the case in the traditional vodka-producing nations, so many distillers from these countries prefer to use very accurate distillation but minimal filtering, thus preserving the unique flavors and characteristics of their products.\nThe master distiller is in charge of distilling the vodka and directing its filtration, which includes the removal of the \"fore-shots\", \"heads\" and \"tails\". These components of the distillate contain flavor compounds such as ethyl acetate and ethyl lactate (heads) as well as the fusel oils (tails) that impact the usually desired clean taste of vodka. Through numerous rounds of distillation, or the use of a fractioning still, the taste is modified and clarity is increased. In contrast, the distillery process for liquors such as whiskey, rum, and baijiu allow portions of the \"heads\" and \"tails\" to remain, giving them their unique flavors.\nRepeated distillation of vodka will make its ethanol level much higher than is acceptable to most end users, whether legislation determines strength limits or not. Depending on the distillation method and the technique of the still master, the final filtered and distilled vodka may have as much as 95\u201396% ethanol. For this reason, most vodka is diluted with water before bottling.\nFlavoring.\nWhile most vodkas are unflavored, many flavored vodkas have been produced in traditional vodka-drinking areas, often as home-made recipes to improve vodka's taste or for medicinal purposes. Flavorings include red pepper, ginger, fruit flavors, vanilla, chocolate (without sweetener), and cinnamon. In Russia, vodka flavored with honey and pepper, \"pertsovka\" in Russian, is also very popular. In Poland and Belarus, the leaves of the local bison grass are added to produce \"\u017cubr\u00f3wka\" (Polish) and \"zubrovka\" (Belarusian) vodka, with slightly sweet flavors and light amber colors. In Lithuania and Poland, a famous vodka containing honey is called \"krupnik\".\nThis tradition of flavoring is also prevalent in the Nordic countries, where vodka seasoned with herbs, fruits, and spices is the appropriate strong drink for several seasonal festivities. Sweden has forty-odd common varieties of herb-flavored vodka (\"kryddat br\u00e4nnvin\"). In Poland and Ukraine, a separate category ( in Ukraine and \"nalewka\" in Poland) is used for vodka-based spirits with fruit, root, flower, or herb extracts, which are often home-made or produced by small commercial distilleries. Their alcohol contents vary between 15 and 75%. In Estonia, vodkas are available with barberry, blackcurrant, cherry, green apple, lemon, vanilla, and watermelon flavors.\nIn most cases, vodka flavoring comes from a post-distillation infusion of flavors. Through the fermentation process, grain mash is transformed into a neutral alcohol beverage that is unflavored. The process of flavoring vodka so that it tastes like fruits, chocolate, and other foods occurs after fermentation and distillation. Various chemicals that reproduce the flavor profiles of foods are added into vodka to give it a specific taste.\nToday.\nVodka is less likely than other spirits to produce the undesirable aftereffects of heavy consumption\n(though no less likely to intoxicate) because of its low level of fusel oils and congeners, which are impurities that flavor spirits.\nSince the year 2000, because of evolving consumer tastes and regulatory changes, several 'artisanal vodka' or even 'ultra premium vodka' brands have appeared.\nEuropean Union regulation.\nThe success of grape-based vodka in the United States in the early twenty-first century prompted traditional vodka producers in the Vodka Belt countries of Poland, Finland, Estonia, Lithuania, and Sweden to campaign for EU legislation that would define \"vodka\" as only spirits made from grain or potatoes. This proposition provoked heavy criticism from South European countries, which often distill used mash from wine-making into spirits; although higher-quality mash is usually distilled into some variety of pomace brandy, the lower-quality mash is better turned into neutral-flavored spirits instead. Any vodka not made from either grain or potatoes would have to display the products used in its production. This regulation entered into force in 2008.\nCanadian regulations.\nUnder Canadian regulations, vodka is a potable alcoholic distillate obtained from potatoes, cereal grain, or any other material of agricultural origin fermented by the action of yeast or a mixture of yeast and other microorganisms.\nUnited States regulations.\nIn 1956, it was put into revenue ruling that sugar not more than 0.2% and trace amounts of citric acid are not considered flavoring agent. The meaning of \"trace amounts\" of citric acid was clarified as not more than 1,000\u00a0ppm in 1995.\nIt is no longer defined as \"to be without distinctive character, aroma, taste, or color.\" The law includes other requirements: Vodka cannot be aged in wood; it may or may not be charcoal filtered; and it must meet minimum distillation and bottling proofs.\nBoycotts.\nIn summer 2013, American LGBT rights activists targeted Russian vodka brands for boycott over Russia's anti-gay policies.\nIn late February 2022, with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, some North American liquor stores and bars expressed symbolic solidarity with Ukraine, and opposition to Russia, by boycotting Russian vodka brands.\nOne critic argued that boycotts of Russian-branded vodka may inadvertently affect U.S. vodka manufacturers and noted that only 1.2 percent of U.S. vodka imports come from Russia.\nIllegal production.\nIn some countries, black-market or \"bathtub\" vodka is widespread because it can be produced easily and avoids taxation. However, severe poisoning, blindness, or death can occur as a result of dangerous industrial ethanol substitutes being added by black-market producers. In March 2007 in a documentary, BBC News UK sought to find the cause of severe jaundice among imbibers of a \"bathtub\" vodka in Russia. The cause was suspected to be an industrial disinfectant (Extrasept)\u201495% ethanol but also containing a highly toxic chemical\u2014added to the vodka by the illegal traders because of its high alcohol content and low price. Death toll estimates list at least 120 dead and more than 1,000 poisoned. The death toll is expected to rise due to the chronic nature of the cirrhosis that is causing jaundice.\nPublic health effects.\nEstimates of the annual death toll resulting from vodka consumption extend up to the thousands in Russia.\nCooking.\nVodka can also be used in cooking and various recipes are improved by the addition of vodka or rely on it as a key ingredient. Vodka sauce is a pasta sauce made from tomato sauce, cream, and vodka that gained popularity in the 1970s. Vodka can be used in baking as a substitute for water: pie crusts can be made flakier with vodka. It may be used in seafood dishes, cheesecake, or bitters.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

After completing her drama school education, Leigh appeared in small roles in four films in 1935 and progressed to the role of heroine in \"Fire Over England\" (1937). She then won the Academy Award for Best Actress twice, for her performances as Scarlett O'Hara in \"Gone with the Wind\" (1939) and Blanche DuBois in the film version of \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" (1951), a role she had also played on stage in London's West End in 1949. For the latter role, she also won the Volpi Cup for Best Actress. She also won a Tony Award for her work in the Broadway musical version of \"Tovarich\" (1963). \nDespite her fame as a screen actress, Leigh was primarily a stage performer. During her 30-year career, she played roles ranging from the heroines of No\u00ebl Coward and George Bernard Shaw comedies to classic Shakespearean characters such as Ophelia, Cleopatra, Juliet and Lady Macbeth. Later in life, she performed as a character actress in a few films. Although her career had periods of inactivity, in 1999 the American Film Institute (AFI) ranked Leigh as the 16th-greatest female movie star of classic Hollywood cinema. Also lauded for her beauty, Leigh felt that her physical attributes sometimes prevented her from being taken seriously as an actress. \nAt the time, the public strongly identified Leigh with her second husband, Laurence Olivier, who was her spouse from 1940 to 1960. Leigh and Olivier starred together in many stage productions, with Olivier often directing, and in three films. She earned a reputation for being difficult to work with, and for much of her life she had bipolar disorder, as well as recurrent bouts of chronic tuberculosis, which was first diagnosed in the mid-1940s and ultimately led to her death at age 53.\nLife and career.\n1913\u20131934: Early life and acting debut.\nLeigh was born Vivian Mary Hartley on 5 November 1913 in British India in Darjeeling, Bengal Presidency. She was the only child of Ernest Richard Hartley, a British broker, and his wife, Gertrude Mary Frances (n\u00e9e Yackjee; she also used her mother's maiden name of Robinson). Her father was born in Scotland in 1882, while her mother, a devout Catholic, was born in Darjeeling in 1888 and might have been of Irish, Parsi Indian, and Armenian ancestry. Gertrude's parents, who lived in India, were Michael John Yackjee, an Anglo-Indian man of independent means, and Mary Teresa Robinson, who was born to an Irish family killed during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and grew up in an orphanage, where she met Yackjee; they married in 1872 and had five children, of whom Gertrude was the youngest. Ernest and Gertrude Hartley were married in 1912 in Kensington, London.\nIn 1917, Ernest Hartley was transferred to Bangalore as an officer in the Indian Cavalry, while Gertrude and Vivian stayed in Ootacamund. At the age of three, Vivian made her first stage appearance for her mother's amateur theatre group, reciting \"Little Bo Peep\". Gertrude Hartley tried to instill an appreciation of literature in her daughter and introduced her to the works of Hans Christian Andersen, Lewis Carroll and Rudyard Kipling, as well as stories of Greek mythology and Indian folklore. At the age of six, Vivian was sent by her mother from Loreto Convent, Darjeeling, to the Convent of the Sacred Heart (now Woldingham School) then situated in Roehampton, Middlesex. One of her school friends there was future actress Maureen O'Sullivan, two years her senior, to whom Vivian expressed her desire to become \"a great actress\". She was removed from the school by her father, and travelling with her parents for four years, she attended schools in Europe, notably in Dinard (Brittany, France), Biarritz (France), the Sacred Heart in San Remo on the Italian Riviera, and in Paris, becoming fluent in both French and Italian. The family returned to Britain in 1931. She attended \"A Connecticut Yankee\", one of O'Sullivan's films playing in London's West End, and told her parents of her ambitions to become an actress. Shortly after, her father enrolled Vivian at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London.\nVivian met Herbert Leigh Holman, known as Leigh Holman, a barrister 13 years her senior, in 1931. Despite his disapproval of \"theatrical people\", they married on 20 December 1932 and she terminated her studies at RADA, her attendance and interest in acting having already waned after meeting Holman. On 12 October 1933 in London, she gave birth to a daughter, Suzanne Holman, later Suzanne Farrington.\n1935\u20131939: Early career and Laurence Olivier.\nLeigh's friends suggested she take a minor role as a schoolgirl in the film \"Things Are Looking Up\", which was her film debut, albeit uncredited as an extra. She engaged an agent, John Gliddon, who believed that \"Vivian Holman\" was not a suitable name for an actress. After rejecting his many suggestions, she took \"Vivian Leigh\" as her professional name. Gliddon recommended her to Alexander Korda as a possible film actress, but Korda rejected her as lacking potential. She was cast in the play \"The Mask of Virtue\", directed by Sydney Carroll in 1935, and received excellent reviews, followed by interviews and newspaper articles. One such article was from the \"Daily Express\", in which the interviewer noted that \"a lightning change came over her face\", which was the first public mention of the rapid changes in mood that had become characteristic of her. John Betjeman, future poet laureate, described her as \"the essence of English girlhood\". Korda attended her opening night performance, admitted his error, and signed her to a film contract. She continued with the play but, when Korda moved it to a larger theatre, Leigh was found to be unable to project her voice adequately or to hold the attention of so large an audience, and the play closed soon after. In the playbill, Carroll had revised the spelling of her first name to \"Vivien\".\nIn 1960, Leigh recalled her ambivalence towards her first experience of critical acclaim and sudden fame, commenting that \"some critics saw fit to be as foolish as to say that I was a great actress. And I thought, that was a foolish, wicked thing to say, because it put such an onus and such a responsibility onto me, which I simply wasn't able to carry. And it took me years to learn enough to live up to what they said for those first notices. I find it so stupid. I remember the critic very well and have never forgiven him.\"\nIn the autumn of 1935 and at Leigh's insistence, John Buckmaster introduced her to Laurence Olivier at the Savoy Grill, where he and his first wife Jill Esmond dined regularly after his performance in \"Romeo and Juliet\". Olivier had seen Leigh in \"The Mask of Virtue\" earlier in May and congratulated her on her performance. Olivier and Leigh began an affair while acting as lovers in \"Fire Over England\" (1937), while Olivier was still married to Esmond and Leigh to Holman. During this period, Leigh read the Margaret Mitchell novel \"Gone with the Wind\" and instructed her American agent to recommend her to David O. Selznick, who was planning a film version. She remarked to a journalist, \"I've cast myself as Scarlett O'Hara\", and \"The Observer\" film critic C. A. Lejeune recalled a conversation of the same period in which Leigh \"stunned us all\" with the assertion that Olivier \"won't play Rhett Butler, but I shall play Scarlett O'Hara. Wait and see.\"\nDespite her relative inexperience, Leigh was chosen to play Ophelia to Olivier's Hamlet in an Old Vic Theatre production staged at Elsinore, Denmark. Olivier later recalled an incident when her mood rapidly changed as she was preparing to go onstage. Without apparent provocation, she began screaming at him before suddenly becoming silent and staring into space. She was able to perform without mishap, and by the following day she had returned to normal with no recollection of the event. It was the first time Olivier witnessed such behaviour from her. They began living together, as their respective spouses had each refused to grant either of them a divorce. Under the moral standards then enforced by the film industry, their relationship had to be kept from public view.\nLeigh appeared with Robert Taylor, Lionel Barrymore and Maureen O'Sullivan in \"A Yank at Oxford\" (1938), which was the first of her films to receive attention in the United States. During production, she developed a reputation for being difficult and unreasonable, partly because she disliked her secondary role but mainly because her petulant antics seemed to be paying dividends. After dealing with the threat of a lawsuit brought over a frivolous incident, Korda instructed her agent to warn her that her option would not be renewed if her behaviour did not improve. Her next role was in \"Sidewalks of London\", also known as \"St. Martin's Lane\" (1938), with Charles Laughton.\nOlivier had been attempting to broaden his film career. He was not well known in the United States despite his success in Britain, and earlier attempts to introduce him to American audiences had failed. Offered the role of Heathcliff in Samuel Goldwyn's production of \"Wuthering Heights\" (1939), he travelled to Hollywood, leaving Leigh in London. Goldwyn and the film's director, William Wyler, offered Leigh the secondary role of Isabella, but she refused, preferring the role of Cathy, which went to Merle Oberon.\n1939: \"Gone with the Wind\".\nHollywood was in the midst of a widely publicised search to find an actress to portray Scarlett O'Hara in David O. Selznick's production of \"Gone with the Wind\" (1939). At the time, Myron Selznick\u2014David's brother and Leigh's American theatrical agent\u2014was the London representative of the Myron Selznick Agency. In February 1938, Leigh asked Myron that she be considered to play the part of Scarlett O'Hara.\nDavid O. Selznick watched her performances that month in \"Fire Over England\" and \"A Yank at Oxford\" and thought that she was excellent but in no way a possible Scarlett because she was \"too British\". Leigh travelled to Los Angeles, however, to be with Olivier and to try to convince David Selznick that she was the right person for the part. Myron Selznick also represented Olivier and when he met Leigh, he felt that she possessed the qualities that his brother was searching for. According to legend, Myron Selznick took Leigh and Olivier to the set where the burning of the Atlanta Depot scene was being filmed and stage-managed an encounter, where he introduced Leigh, derisively addressing his younger brother, \"Hey, genius, meet your Scarlett O'Hara.\" The following day, Leigh read a scene for Selznick, who organized a screen test with director George Cukor and wrote to his wife, \"She's the Scarlett dark horse and looks damn good. Not for anyone's ear but your own: it's narrowed down to Paulette Goddard, Jean Arthur, Joan Bennett and Vivien Leigh\". The director, George Cukor, concurred and praised Leigh's \"incredible wildness\". She secured the role of Scarlett soon after.\nFilming proved difficult for Leigh. Cukor was dismissed and replaced by Victor Fleming, with whom Leigh frequently quarrelled. She and Olivia de Havilland secretly met with Cukor at night and on weekends for his advice about how they should play their parts. Leigh befriended Clark Gable, his wife Carole Lombard and Olivia de Havilland, but she clashed with Leslie Howard, with whom she was required to play several emotional scenes. Leigh was sometimes required to work seven days a week, often late into the night, which added to her distress, and she missed Olivier, who was working in New York City. On a long-distance telephone call to Olivier, she declared: \"Puss, my puss, how I hate film acting! Hate, hate, and never want to do another film again!\"\nQuoted in a 2006 biography of Olivier, Olivia de Havilland defended Leigh against claims of her manic behaviour during the filming of \"Gone with the Wind\": \"Vivien was impeccably professional, impeccably disciplined on \"Gone with the Wind\". She had two great concerns: doing her best work in an extremely difficult role and being separated from Larry [Olivier], who was in New York.\"\n\"Gone with the Wind\" brought Leigh immediate attention and fame, but she was quoted as saying, \"I'm not a film star\u2014I'm an actress. Being a film star\u2014just a film star\u2014is such a false life, lived for fake values and for publicity. Actresses go on for a long time and there are always marvellous parts to play.\" The film won 10 Academy Awards including a Best Actress award for Leigh, who also won a New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress.\n1940\u20131949: Marriage and early collaborations with Olivier.\nIn February 1940, Jill Esmond agreed to divorce Laurence Olivier, and Leigh Holman agreed to divorce Vivien, although they maintained a strong friendship for the rest of Leigh's life. Esmond was granted custody of Tarquin, her son with Olivier. Holman was granted custody of Suzanne, his daughter with Leigh. On 31 August 1940, Olivier and Leigh were married at the San Ysidro Ranch in Santa Barbara, California, in a ceremony attended only by their hosts, Ronald and Benita Colman and witnesses, Katharine Hepburn and Garson Kanin. Leigh had made a screen test and hoped to co-star with Olivier in \"Rebecca\", which was to be directed by Alfred Hitchcock with Olivier in the leading role. After viewing Leigh's screen test, David Selznick noted that \"she doesn't seem right as to sincerity or age or innocence\", a view shared by Hitchcock and Leigh's mentor, George Cukor.\nSelznick observed that she had shown no enthusiasm for the part until Olivier had been confirmed as the lead actor, so he cast Joan Fontaine. He refused to allow her to join Olivier in \"Pride and Prejudice\" (1940), and Greer Garson played the role Leigh had wanted for herself. \"Waterloo Bridge\" (1940) was to have starred Olivier and Leigh; however, Selznick replaced Olivier with Robert Taylor, then at the peak of his success as one of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's most popular male stars. Her top billing reflected her status in Hollywood, and the film was popular with audiences and critics.\nThe Oliviers mounted a stage production of \"Romeo and Juliet\" for Broadway. The New York press publicised the adulterous nature of the beginning of Olivier and Leigh's relationship and questioned their ethics in not returning to the UK to help with the war effort. Critics were hostile in their assessment of \"Romeo and Juliet\". Brooks Atkinson for \"The New York Times\" wrote: \"Although Miss Leigh and Mr. Olivier are handsome young people, they hardly act their parts at all.\" While most of the blame was attributed to Olivier's acting and direction, Leigh was also criticised, with Bernard Grebanier commenting on the \"thin, shopgirl quality of Miss Leigh's voice\". The couple had invested almost all of their combined savings of $40,000 () in the project, and the failure was a financial disaster for them.\nThe Oliviers filmed \"That Hamilton Woman\" (1941) with Olivier as Horatio Nelson and Leigh as Emma Hamilton. With the United States not yet having entered the war, it was one of several Hollywood films made with the aim of arousing a pro-British sentiment among American audiences. The film was popular in the United States and an outstanding success in the Soviet Union. Winston Churchill arranged a screening for a party that included Franklin D. Roosevelt and, on its conclusion, addressed the group, saying, \"Gentlemen, I thought this film would interest you, showing great events similar to those in which you have just been taking part.\" The Oliviers remained favourites of Churchill, attending dinners and occasions at his request for the rest of his life; and, of Leigh, he was quoted as saying, \"By Jove, she's a clinker.\"\nThe Oliviers returned to Britain in January 1941, and Leigh toured through North Africa in 1943 as part of a revue for the armed forces stationed in the region. She reportedly turned down a studio contract worth $5,000 a week () in order to volunteer as part of the war effort. Leigh performed for troops before falling ill with a persistent cough and fevers. In 1944, she was diagnosed as having tuberculosis in her left lung and spent several weeks in hospital before appearing to have recovered. Leigh was filming \"Caesar and Cleopatra\" (1945) when she discovered she was pregnant, then had a miscarriage. Leigh temporarily fell into a deep depression that hit its low point with her falling to the floor, sobbing in a hysterical fit. This was the first of many major bipolar disorder breakdowns. Olivier later came to recognise the symptoms of an impending episode\u2014several days of hyperactivity followed by a period of depression and an explosive breakdown, after which Leigh would have no memory of the event, but would be acutely embarrassed and remorseful.\nWith her doctor's approval, Leigh was well enough to resume acting in 1946, starring in a successful London production of Thornton Wilder's \"The Skin of Our Teeth\"; but her films of this period, \"Caesar and Cleopatra\" (1945) and \"Anna Karenina\" (1948), were not great commercial successes. All British films in this period were adversely affected by a Hollywood boycott of British films. In 1947, Olivier was knighted and Leigh accompanied him to Buckingham Palace for the investiture. She became Lady Olivier.\nBy 1948, Olivier was on the board of directors for the Old Vic Theatre, and he and Leigh embarked on a six-month tour of Australia and New Zealand to raise funds for the theatre. Olivier played the lead in \"Richard III\" and also performed with Leigh in \"The School for Scandal\" and \"The Skin of Our Teeth\". The tour was an outstanding success and, although Leigh was plagued with insomnia and allowed her understudy to replace her for a week while she was ill, she generally withstood the demands placed upon her, with Olivier noting her ability to \"charm the press\". Members of the company later recalled several quarrels between the couple as Olivier was increasingly resentful of the demands placed on him during the tour. The most dramatic altercation occurred in Christchurch, New Zealand, when her shoes were not found and Leigh refused to go onstage without them. Olivier screamed an obscenity at her and slapped her face, and a devastated Leigh slapped him in return, dismayed that he would hit her publicly. Subsequently, she made her way to the stage in borrowed pumps, and in seconds, had \"dried her tears and smiled brightly onstage\". By the end of the tour, both were exhausted and ill. Olivier told a journalist, \"You may not know it, but you are talking to a couple of walking corpses.\" Later, he would observe that he \"lost Vivien\" in Australia. The success of the tour encouraged the Oliviers to make their first West End appearance together, performing the same works with one addition, \"Antigone,\" included at Leigh's insistence because she wished to play a role in a tragedy.\n1949\u20131951: Play and film roles in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\".\nLeigh next sought the role of Blanche DuBois in the West End stage production of Tennessee Williams's \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" and was cast after Williams and the play's producer Irene Mayer Selznick saw her in \"The School for Scandal\" and \"Antigone\"; Olivier was contracted to direct. The play contained a rape scene and references to promiscuity and homosexuality, and was destined to be controversial; the media discussion about its suitability added to Leigh's anxiety. Nevertheless, she believed strongly in the importance of the work.\nWhen the West End production of \"Streetcar\" opened in October 1949, J. B. Priestley denounced the play and Leigh's performance; and the critic Kenneth Tynan, who was to make a habit of dismissing her stage performances, commented that Leigh was badly miscast because British actors were \"too well-bred to emote effectively on stage\". Olivier and Leigh were chagrined that part of the commercial success of the play lay in audience members attending to see what they believed would be a salacious story, rather than the Greek tragedy that they envisioned. The play also had strong supporters, among them No\u00ebl Coward, who described Leigh as \"magnificent\".\nAfter 326 performances, Leigh finished her run, and she was soon assigned to reprise her role as Blanche DuBois in the film version of the play. Her irreverent and often bawdy sense of humour allowed her to establish a rapport with Marlon Brando, but she had an initial difficulty in working with director Elia Kazan, who was displeased with the direction that Olivier had taken in shaping the character of Blanche. Kazan had favoured Jessica Tandy and later, Olivia de Havilland over Leigh, but knew she had been a success on the London stage as Blanche. He later commented that he did not hold her in high regard as an actress, believing that \"she had a small talent.\" As work progressed, however, he became \"full of admiration\" for \"the greatest determination to excel of any actress I've known. She'd have crawled over broken glass if she thought it would help her performance.\" Leigh found the role gruelling and commented to the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"I had nine months in the theatre of Blanche DuBois. Now she's in command of me.\" Olivier accompanied her to Hollywood where he was to co-star with Jennifer Jones in William Wyler's \"Carrie\" (1952).\nLeigh's performance in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" won glowing reviews, as well as a second Academy Award for Best Actress, a British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Award for Best British Actress, and a New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress. Tennessee Williams commented that Leigh brought to the role \"everything that I intended, and much that I had never dreamed of\". Leigh herself had mixed feelings about her association with the character; in later years, she said that playing Blanche DuBois \"tipped me over into madness\".\n1951\u20131960: Struggle with mental illness.\nIn 1951 in London, Leigh and Laurence Olivier performed two plays about Cleopatra, William Shakespeare's \"Antony and Cleopatra\" and George Bernard Shaw's \"Caesar and Cleopatra\", alternating the play each night and winning good reviews. They took the productions to New York, where they performed a season at the Ziegfeld Theatre into 1952. The reviews there were also mostly positive, but film critic Kenneth Tynan angered them when he suggested that Leigh's was a mediocre talent that forced Olivier to compromise his own. Tynan's diatribe almost precipitated another collapse; Leigh, terrified of failure and intent on achieving greatness, dwelt on his comments and ignored the positive reviews of other critics.\nIn January 1953, Leigh travelled to Ceylon to film \"Elephant Walk\" with Peter Finch. Shortly after filming commenced, she had a nervous breakdown and Paramount Pictures replaced her with Elizabeth Taylor. Olivier returned her to their home in Britain, where, between periods of incoherence, Leigh told her husband she was in love with Finch and had been having an affair with him. Over a period of several months, she gradually recovered. As a result of this episode, many of the Oliviers' friends learned of her problems. David Niven said she had been \"quite, quite mad\". No\u00ebl Coward expressed surprise in his diary that \"things had been bad and getting worse since 1948 or thereabouts\". Leigh's romantic relationship with Finch began in 1948, and waxed and waned for several years, ultimately flickering out as her mental condition deteriorated.\nAlso in 1953, Leigh recovered sufficiently to play \"The Sleeping Prince\" with Olivier, and in 1955 they performed a season at Stratford-upon-Avon in Shakespeare's \"Twelfth Night\", \"Macbeth\" and \"Titus Andronicus\". They played to capacity houses and attracted generally good reviews, with Leigh's health seemingly stable. John Gielgud directed \"Twelfth Night\" and wrote, \"...\u00a0perhaps I will still make a good thing of that divine play, especially if he will let me pull her little ladyship (who is brainier than he but \"not\" a born actress) out of her timidity and safeness. He dares too confidently\u00a0... but she hardly dares at all and is terrified of overreaching her technique and doing anything that she has not killed the spontaneity of by overpractice.\" In 1955, Leigh starred in Anatole Litvak's film \"The Deep Blue Sea\"; co-star Kenneth More felt he had poor chemistry with Leigh during the filming.\nIn 1956, Leigh took the lead role in the No\u00ebl Coward play \"South Sea Bubble\", but withdrew from the production when she became pregnant. Several weeks later, she miscarried and entered a period of depression that lasted for months. She joined Olivier for a European tour of \"Titus Andronicus\", but the tour was marred by Leigh's frequent outbursts against Olivier and other members of the company. After their return to London, her former husband, Leigh Holman, who could still exert a strong influence on her, stayed with the Oliviers and helped calm her.\nIn 1959, when she achieved a success with the No\u00ebl Coward comedy \"Look After Lulu!\", a critic working for \"The Times\" described her as \"beautiful, delectably cool and matter of fact, she is mistress of every situation\".\nConsidering her marriage to be over, Leigh began a relationship with actor John Merivale in 1960, who knew of Leigh's medical condition and assured Olivier that he would care for her. That same year, she and Olivier divorced and Olivier soon married actress Joan Plowright. In his autobiography, Olivier discussed the years of strain they had experienced because of Leigh's illness: \"Throughout her possession by that uncannily evil monster, manic depression, with its deadly ever-tightening spirals, she retained her own individual canniness\u2014an ability to disguise her true mental condition from almost all except me, for whom she could hardly be expected to take the trouble.\"\n1961\u20131967: Final years and death.\nMerivale proved to be a stabilising influence for Leigh, but despite her apparent contentment, she was quoted by Radie Harris as confiding that she \"would rather have lived a short life with Larry [Olivier] than face a long one without him\". Her first husband Leigh Holman also spent considerable time with her. Merivale joined her for a tour of Australia, New Zealand and Latin America that lasted from July 1961 until May 1962, and Leigh enjoyed positive reviews without sharing the spotlight with Olivier. Though she was still beset by bouts of depression, she continued to work in the theatre and, in 1963, won a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical for her role in \"Tovarich\". She also appeared in the films \"The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone\" (1961) and \"Ship of Fools\" (1965).\nLeigh's last screen appearance in \"Ship of Fools\" was both a triumph and emblematic of her illnesses that were taking root. Producer and director Stanley Kramer, who ended up with the film, planned to star Leigh but was initially unaware of her fragile mental and physical state. Later recounting her work, Kramer remembered her courage in taking on the difficult role, \"She was ill, and the courage to go ahead, the courage to make the film\u2014was almost unbelievable.\" Leigh's performance was tinged by paranoia and resulted in outbursts that marred her relationship with other actors, although both Simone Signoret and Lee Marvin were sympathetic and understanding. In one unusual instance during the attempted rape scene, Leigh became distraught and hit Marvin so hard with a spiked shoe that it marked his face. Leigh won the \"L'\u00c9toile de Cristal\" for her performance in a leading role in \"Ship of Fools\".\nIn May 1967, Leigh was rehearsing to appear with Michael Redgrave in Edward Albee's \"A Delicate Balance\" when her tuberculosis resurfaced. Following several weeks of rest, she seemed to recover. On the night of 7 July 1967, Merivale left her as usual at their Eaton Square flat to perform in a play, and he returned home just before midnight to find her asleep. About 30 minutes later (by now 8 July), he entered the bedroom and discovered her body on the floor. She had been attempting to walk to the bathroom and, as her lungs filled with liquid, she collapsed and suffocated. Merivale first contacted her family and later was able to reach Olivier, who was receiving treatment for prostate cancer in a nearby hospital. In his autobiography, Olivier described his \"grievous anguish\" as he immediately travelled to Leigh's residence, to find that Merivale had moved her body onto the bed. Olivier paid his respects, and \"stood and prayed for forgiveness for all the evils that had sprung up between us\", before helping Merivale make funeral arrangements; Olivier stayed until her body was removed from the flat.\nHer death was publicly announced on 8 July, and the lights of every theatre in central London were extinguished for an hour. A Catholic service for Leigh was held at St. Mary's Church, Cadogan Street, London. Her funeral was attended by the luminaries of British stage and screen. According to the provisions of her will, Leigh was cremated at the Golders Green Crematorium and her ashes were scattered on the lake at her summer home, Tickerage Mill, near Blackboys, East Sussex, England. A memorial service was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields, with a final tribute read by John Gielgud. In 1968, Leigh became the first actress honoured in the United States by \"The Friends of the Libraries at the University of Southern California\". The ceremony was conducted as a memorial service, with selections from her films shown and tributes provided by such associates as George Cukor, who screened the tests that Leigh had made for \"Gone with the Wind\", the first time the screen tests had been seen in 30 years.\nArtistry and legacy.\nLeigh was considered to be one of the most beautiful actresses of her day, and her directors emphasised this in most of her films. When asked if she believed her beauty had been an impediment to being taken seriously as an actress, she said, \"People think that if you look fairly reasonable, you can't possibly act, and as I only care about acting, I think beauty can be a great handicap, if you really want to look like the part you're playing, which isn't necessarily like you.\"\nDirector George Cukor described Leigh as a \"consummate actress, hampered by beauty\", and Laurence Olivier said that critics should \"give her credit for being an actress and not go on forever letting their judgments be distorted by her great beauty.\" Garson Kanin shared their viewpoint and described Leigh as \"a stunner whose ravishing beauty often tended to obscure her staggering achievements as an actress. Great beauties are infrequently great actresses\u2014simply because they don't need to be. Vivien was different; ambitious, persevering, serious, often inspired.\"\nLeigh explained that she played \"as many different parts as possible\" in an attempt to learn her craft and to dispel prejudice about her abilities. She believed that comedy was more difficult to play than drama because it required more precise timing and said that more emphasis should be placed upon comedy as part of an actor's training. Nearing the end of her career, which ranged from No\u00ebl Coward comedies to Shakespearean tragedies, she observed, \"It's much easier to make people cry than to make them laugh.\"\nHer early performances brought her immediate success in Britain, but she remained largely unknown in other parts of the world until the release of \"Gone with the Wind\". In December 1939, film critic Frank Nugent wrote in \"The New York Times\", \"Miss Leigh's Scarlett has vindicated the absurd talent quest that indirectly turned her up. She is so perfectly designed for the part by art and nature that any other actress in the role would be inconceivable\", and as her fame escalated, she was featured on the cover of \"Time\" magazine as Scarlett. In 1969, critic Andrew Sarris commented that the success of the film had been largely due to \"the inspired casting\" of Leigh, and in 1998, wrote that \"she lives in our minds and memories as a dynamic force rather than as a static presence\". Film historian and critic Leonard Maltin described the film as one of the all-time greats, writing in 1998 that Leigh \"brilliantly played\" her role.\nHer performance in the West End production of \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", described by the theatre writer Phyllis Hartnoll as \"proof of greater powers as an actress than she had hitherto shown\", led to a lengthy period during which she was considered one of the finest actresses in British theatre. Discussing the subsequent film version, Pauline Kael wrote that Leigh and Marlon Brando gave \"two of the greatest performances ever put on film\" and that Leigh's was \"one of those rare performances that can truly be said to evoke both fear and pity.\"\nHer greatest critic was Kenneth Tynan, who ridiculed Leigh's performance opposite Olivier in the 1955 production of \"Titus Andronicus\", commenting that she \"receives the news that she is about to be ravished on her husband's corpse with little more than the mild annoyance of one who would have preferred foam rubber.\" He was also critical of her reinterpretation of Lady Macbeth in 1955, saying that her performance was insubstantial and lacked the necessary fury demanded of the role. After her death, however, Tynan revised his opinion, describing his earlier criticism as \"one of the worst errors of judgment\" he had ever made. He came to believe that Leigh's interpretation, in which Lady Macbeth uses her sexual allure to keep Macbeth enthralled, \"made more sense\u00a0... than the usual battle-axe\" portrayal of the character. In a survey of theatre critics conducted shortly after Leigh's death, several named her performance as Lady Macbeth as one of her greatest achievements in theatre.\nLeigh was portrayed by American actress Morgan Brittany in \"The Day of the Locust\" (1975), \"Gable and Lombard\" (1976) and \"The Scarlett O'Hara War\" (1980). English actress Julia Ormond played Leigh in \"My Week with Marilyn\" (2011). Leigh was also portrayed by Katie McGuinness in the Netflix miniseries \"Hollywood\" (2020).\nIn 1969, a plaque to Leigh was placed in the Actors' Church, St Paul's, Covent Garden, London. In 1985, a portrait of her was included in a series of United Kingdom postage stamps, along with Alfred Hitchcock, Charlie Chaplin, Peter Sellers and David Niven to commemorate \"British Film Year\". In April 1996, she appeared in the Centenary of Cinema stamp issue (with Sir Laurence Olivier) and in April 2013 was again included in another series, this time celebrating the 100th anniversary of her birth. The British Library in London purchased the papers of Olivier from his estate in 1999. Known as \"The Laurence Olivier Archive\", the collection includes many of Leigh's personal papers, including numerous letters she wrote to Olivier. The papers of Leigh, including letters, photographs, contracts and diaries, were owned by her daughter, Suzanne Farrington. (Farrington died in 2015.) In 1994, the National Library of Australia purchased a photograph album, monogrammed \"L &amp; V O\" and believed to have belonged to the Oliviers, containing 573 photographs of the couple during their 1948 tour of Australia. It is now held as part of the record of the history of the performing arts in Australia.

As the only treatise on architecture to survive from antiquity, it has been regarded since the Renaissance as the first book on architectural theory, as well as a major source on the canon of classical architecture. It is not clear to what extent his contemporaries regarded his book as original or important.\nHe states that all buildings should have three attributes: , , and (\"strength\", \"utility\", and \"beauty\"), principles reflected in much Ancient Roman architecture. His discussion of perfect proportion in architecture and the human body led to the famous Renaissance drawing of the \"Vitruvian Man\" by Leonardo da Vinci.\nLittle is known about Vitruvius' life, but by his own description he served as an artilleryman, the third class of arms in the Roman military offices. He probably served as a senior officer of artillery in charge of \"doctores ballistarum\" (artillery experts) and \"libratores\" who actually operated the machines. As an army engineer he specialized in the construction of \"ballista\" and \"scorpio\" artillery war machines for sieges. It is possible that Vitruvius served with Julius Caesar's chief engineer Lucius Cornelius Balbus.\nVitruvius' was well-known and widely copied in the Middle Ages and survives in many dozens of manuscripts, though in 1414 it was \"rediscovered\" by the Florentine humanist Poggio Bracciolini in the library of Saint Gall Abbey. Leon Battista Alberti published it in his seminal treatise on architecture, (c.\u20091450). The first known Latin printed edition was by Fra Giovanni Sulpitius in Rome in 1486. Translations followed in Italian, French, English, German, Spanish, and several other languages. Though any original illustrations have been lost, the first illustrated edition was published in Venice in 1511 by Fra Giovanni Giocondo, with woodcut illustrations based on descriptions in the text. Bramante, Michelangelo, Palladio, Vignola and earlier architects are known to have studied the work of Vitruvius, and consequently it has had a significant impact on the architecture of many European countries.\nLife and career.\nLittle is known about Vitruvius' life. Most inferences about him are extracted from his only surviving work . His full name is sometimes given as \"Marcus Vitruvius Pollio\", but both the first and last names are uncertain. Marcus Cetius Faventinus writes of \"Vitruvius Polio aliique auctores\"; this can be read as \"Vitruvius Polio, and others\" or, less likely, as \"Vitruvius, Polio, and others\". An inscription in Verona, which names a \"Lucius Vitruvius Cordo\", and an inscription from Thilbilis in North Africa, which names a \"Marcus Vitruvius Mamurra\" have been suggested as evidence that Vitruvius and Mamurra (who was a military \"praefectus fabrum\" under Julius Caesar) were from the same family; or were even the same individual. Neither association, however, is borne out by (which Vitruvius dedicated to Augustus), nor by the little that is known of Mamurra.\nVitruvius was a military engineer (\"praefectus fabrum\"), or a \"praefect architectus armamentarius\" of the \"apparitor\" status group (a branch of the Roman civil service). He is mentioned in Pliny the Elder's table of contents for (Natural History), in the heading for mosaic techniques. Frontinus refers to \"Vitruvius the architect\" in his late 1st-century work \"De aquaeductu\".\nLikely born a free Roman citizen, by his own account Vitruvius served in the Roman army under Caesar with the otherwise poorly identified Marcus Aurelius, Publius Minidius, and Gnaeus Cornelius. These names vary depending on the edition of . Publius Minidius is also written as Publius Numidicus and Publius Numidius, speculated as the same Publius Numisius inscribed on the Roman Theatre at Heraclea.\nAs an army engineer he specialized in the construction of \"ballista\" and \"scorpio\" artillery war machines for sieges. It is speculated that Vitruvius served with Caesar's chief engineer Lucius Cornelius Balbus.\nThe locations where he served can be reconstructed from, for example, descriptions of the building methods of various \"foreign tribes\". Although he describes places throughout , he does not say he was present. His service likely included north Africa, Hispania, Gaul (including Aquitaine), and Pontus.\nTo place the role of Vitruvius the military engineer in context, a description of \"The Prefect of the camp\" or army engineer is quoted here as given by Flavius Vegetius Renatus in \"The Military Institutions of the Romans\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Prefect of the camp, though inferior in rank to the [Prefect], had a post of no small importance. The position of the camp, the direction of the entrenchments, the inspection of the tents or huts of the soldiers and the baggage were comprehended in his province. His authority extended over the sick, and the physicians who had the care of them; and he regulated the expenses relative thereto. He had the charge of providing carriages, bathhouses and the proper tools for sawing and cutting wood, digging trenches, raising parapets, sinking wells and bringing water into the camp. He likewise had the care of furnishing the troops with wood and straw, as well as the rams, \"onagri,\" \"balistae\" and all the other engines of war under his direction. This post was always conferred on an officer of great skill, experience and long service, and who consequently was capable of instructing others in those branches of the profession in which he had distinguished himself.\nAt various locations described by Vitruvius, battles and sieges occurred. He is the only source for the siege of Larignum in 56 BC. Of the battlegrounds of the Gallic War there are references to:\nThese are all sieges of large Gallic \"oppida\". Of the sites involved in Caesar's civil war, we find the Siege of Massilia in 49 BC (modern France), the Battle of Dyrrhachium of 48 BC (modern Albania), the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC (Hellas \u2013 Greece), the Battle of Zela of 47 BC (modern Turkey), and the Battle of Thapsus in 46 BC in Caesar's African campaign. A legion that fits the same sequence of locations is the Legio VI Ferrata, of which \"ballista\" would be an auxiliary unit.\nMainly known for his writings, Vitruvius was himself an architect. In Roman times architecture was a broader subject than at present including the modern fields of architecture, construction management, construction engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering, materials engineering, mechanical engineering, military engineering and urban planning; architectural engineers consider him the first of their discipline, a specialization previously known as technical architecture.\nIn his work describing the construction of military installations, he also commented on the miasma theory \u2013 the idea that unhealthy air from wetlands was the cause of illness, saying:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For fortified towns the following general principles are to be observed. First comes the choice of a very healthy site. Such a site will be high, neither misty nor frosty, and in a climate neither hot nor cold, but temperate; further, without marshes in the neighbourhood. For when the morning breezes blow toward the town at sunrise, if they bring with them mists from marshes and, mingled with the mist, the poisonous breath of the creatures of the marshes to be wafted into the bodies of the inhabitants, they will make the site unhealthy. Again, if the town is on the coast with southern or western exposure, it will not be healthy, because in summer the southern sky grows hot at sunrise and is fiery at noon, while a western exposure grows warm after sunrise, is hot at noon, and at evening all aglow.\nFrontinus mentions Vitruvius in connection with the standard sizes of pipes: probably the role for which he was most widely respected in Roman times. He is often credited as father of architectural acoustics for describing the technique of \"echeas\" placement in theaters. The only building, however, that we know Vitruvius to have worked on is one he tells us about, a \"basilica\" completed in 19 BC. It was built at Fanum Fortunae, now the modern town of Fano. The \"Basilica di Fano\" (to give the building its Italian name) has disappeared so completely that its very site is a matter of conjecture, although various attempts have been made to visualise it. The early Christian practice of converting Roman \"basilicae\" (public buildings) into cathedrals implies the \"basilica\" may be incorporated into the Romanesque Fano Cathedral.\nIn later years the emperor Augustus, through his sister Octavia Minor, sponsored Vitruvius, entitling him with what may have been a pension to guarantee financial independence..\nWhether was written by one author or is a compilation completed by subsequent librarians and copyists, remains an open question. The date of his death is unknown, which suggests that he had enjoyed only a little popularity during his lifetime.\nGerolamo Cardano, in his 1552 book \"De subtilitate rerum\", ranks Vitruvius as one of the 12 persons whom he supposes to have excelled all men in the force of genius and invention; and might have given him first place if it was clear that he had set down his own discoveries.\nJames Anderson's \"The Constitutions of the Free-Masons\" (1734), reprinted by Benjamin Franklin, describes Vitruvius as \"the Father of all true Architects to this Day.\"\n\"De architectura\".\nVitruvius is the author of \"De architectura, libri decem\", known today as \"The Ten Books on Architecture\", a treatise written in Latin on architecture, dedicated to the emperor Augustus. In the preface of Book I, Vitruvius dedicates his writings to giving personal knowledge of the quality of buildings to the emperor. Likely Vitruvius is referring to Marcus Agrippa's campaign of public repairs and improvements. This work is the only surviving major book on architecture from classical antiquity. According to Petri Liukkonen, this text \"influenced deeply from the Early Renaissance onwards artists, thinkers, and architects, among them Leon Battista Alberti (1404\u20131472), Leonardo da Vinci (1452\u20131519), and Michelangelo (1475\u20131564).\" The next major book on architecture, Alberti's reformulation of \"Ten Books\", was not written until 1452.\nHowever, we know there was a significant body of writing about architecture in Greek, where \"architects habitually wrote books about their work\", including two we know of about the Parthenon alone. To A. W. Lawrence, Vitruvius \"has recorded a most elaborate set of rules taken from Greek authors, who must have compiled them gradually in the course of the preceding centuries\".\nVitruvius is famous for asserting in his book that a structure must exhibit the three qualities of \"firmitatis, utilitatis, venustatis\" \u2013 that is, stability, utility, and beauty. These are sometimes termed the Vitruvian virtues or the Vitruvian Triad. According to Vitruvius, architecture is an imitation of nature. As birds and bees built their nests, so humans constructed housing from natural materials, that gave them shelter against the elements. When perfecting this art of building, the Greeks invented the architectural orders: Doric, Ionic and Corinthian. It gave them a sense of proportion, culminating in understanding the proportions of the greatest work of art: the human body. This led Vitruvius in defining his Vitruvian Man, as drawn later by Leonardo da Vinci: the human body inscribed in the circle and the square (the fundamental geometric patterns of the cosmic order). In this book series, Vitruvius also wrote about climate in relation to housing architecture and how to choose locations for cities.\nScope.\nVitruvius is the first Roman architect to have written surviving records of his field. He himself cites older but less complete works. He was less an original thinker or creative intellect than a codifier of existing architectural practice. Roman architects practised a wide variety of disciplines; in modern terms they would also be described as landscape architects, civil engineers, military engineers, structural engineers, surveyors, artists, and craftsmen combined. Etymologically the word architect derives from Greek words meaning 'master' and 'builder'. The first of the \"Ten Books\" deals with many subjects which are now within the scope of landscape architecture.\nIn Book I, Chapter 1, titled The Education of the Architect, Vitruvius instructs...\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;1. Architecture is a science arising out of many other sciences, and adorned with much and varied learning; by the help of which a judgment is formed of those works which are the result of other arts. Practice and theory are its parents. Practice is the frequent and continued contemplation of the mode of executing any given work, or of the mere operation of the hands, for the conversion of the material in the best and readiest way. Theory is the result of that reasoning which demonstrates and explains that the material wrought has been so converted as to answer the end proposed.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHe goes on to say that the architect should be versed in drawing, geometry, optics (lighting), history, philosophy, music, theatre, medicine, and law.\nIn Book I, Chapter 3 (\"The Departments of Architecture\"), Vitruvius divides architecture into three branches, namely: building; the construction of sundials and water clocks; and the design and use of machines in construction and warfare. He further divides building into public and private. Public building includes city planning, public security structures such as walls, gates and towers; the convenient placing of public facilities such as theatres, forums and markets, baths, roads and pavings; and the construction and position of shrines and temples for religious use. Later books are devoted to the understanding, design and construction of each of these.\nProportions of man.\nIn Book III, Chapter 1, Paragraph 3, Vitruvius writes about the proportions of man:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;3. Just so the parts of Temples should correspond with each other, and with the whole. The navel is naturally placed in the centre of the human body, and, if in a man lying with his face upward, and his hands and feet extended, from his navel as the centre, a circle be described, it will touch his fingers and toes. It is not alone by a circle, that the human body is thus circumscribed, as may be seen by placing it within a square. For measuring from the feet to the crown of the head, and then across the arms fully extended, we find the latter measure equal to the former; so that lines at right angles to each other, enclosing the figure, will form a square.\nIt was upon these writings that Renaissance engineers, architects and artists like Mariano di Jacopo Taccola, Pellegrino Prisciani and Francesco di Giorgio Martini and finally Leonardo da Vinci based the illustration of the \"Vitruvian Man\".\nVitruvius described the human figure as being the principal source of proportion.\nThe drawing itself is often used as an implied symbol of the essential symmetry of the human body, and by extension, of the universe as a whole.\nLists of names given in Book VII Introduction.\nIn the introduction to book seven, Vitruvius goes to great lengths to present why he is qualified to write . This is the only location in the work where Vitruvius specifically addresses his personal breadth of knowledge. Similar to a modern reference section, the author's position as one who is knowledgeable and educated is established. The topics range across many fields of expertise reflecting that in Roman times as today construction is a diverse field. Vitruvius is clearly a well-read man.\nIn addition to providing his qualification, Vitruvius summarizes a recurring theme throughout the 10 books, a non-trivial and core contribution of his treatise beyond simply being a construction book. Vitruvius makes the point that the work of some of the most talented is unknown, while many of those of lesser talent but greater political position are famous. This theme runs through Vitruvius's ten books repeatedly \u2013 echoing an implicit prediction that he and his works will also be forgotten.\nVitruvius illustrates this point by naming what he considers the most talented individuals in history. Implicitly challenging the reader that they have never heard of some of these people, Vitruvius goes on and predicts that some of these individuals will be forgotten and their works lost, while other, less deserving political characters of history will be forever remembered with pageantry.\nRediscovery.\nVitruvius' was \"rediscovered\" in 1414 by the Florentine humanist Poggio Bracciolini in the library of Saint Gall Abbey. Leon Battista Alberti (1404\u20131472) publicised it in his seminal treatise on architecture, (c.\u20091450). The first known Latin printed edition was by Fra Giovanni Sulpitius in Rome, 1486. Translations followed in Italian (Cesare Cesariano, 1521), French (Jean Martin, 1547), English, German (, 1543) and Spanish and several other languages. The original illustrations had been lost and the first illustrated edition was published in Venice in 1511 by Fra Giovanni Giocondo, with woodcut illustrations based on descriptions in the text. Later in the 16th-century Andrea Palladio provided illustrations for Daniele Barbaro's commentary on Vitruvius, published in Italian and Latin versions. The most famous illustration is probably Da Vinci's \"Vitruvian Man\".\nThe surviving ruins of Roman antiquity, the Roman Forum, temples, theatres, triumphal arches and their reliefs and statues offered visual examples of the descriptions in the Vitruvian text. Printed and illustrated editions of inspired Renaissance, Baroque and Neoclassical architecture. Filippo Brunelleschi, for example, invented a new type of hoist to lift the large stones for the dome of the cathedral in Florence and was inspired by as well as surviving Roman monuments such as the Pantheon and the Baths of Diocletian.\nNotable editions.\nLatin\nItalian\nFrench\nEnglish\nRoman technology.\nBooks VIII, IX and X form the basis of much of what we know about Roman technology, now augmented by archaeological studies of extant remains, such as the water mills at Barbegal in France. The other major source of information is the compiled by Pliny the Elder much later in c.\u200975\u00a0AD.\nMachines.\nThe work is important for its descriptions of the many different machines used for engineering structures such as hoists, cranes and pulleys, as well as war machines such as catapults, \"ballistae,\" and siege engines. As a practising engineer, Vitruvius must be speaking from personal experience rather than simply describing the works of others. He also describes the construction of sundials and water clocks, and the use of an aeolipile (the first steam engine) as an experiment to demonstrate the nature of atmospheric air movements (wind).\nAqueducts.\nHis description of aqueduct construction includes the way they are surveyed, and the careful choice of materials needed, although Frontinus (a general who was appointed in the late 1st century AD to administer the many aqueducts of Rome), writing a century later, gives much more detail of the practical problems involved in their construction and maintenance. Surely Vitruvius' book would have been of great assistance in this. Vitruvius was writing in the 1st century BC when many of the finest Roman aqueducts were built, and survive to this day, such as those at Segovia and the Pont du Gard. The use of the inverted siphon is described in detail, together with the problems of high pressures developed in the pipe at the base of the siphon, a practical problem with which he seems to be acquainted.\nMaterials.\nHe describes many different construction materials used for a wide variety of different structures, as well as such details as stucco painting. Concrete and lime receive in-depth descriptions.\nVitruvius is cited as one of the earliest sources to connect lead mining and manufacture, its use in drinking water pipes, and its adverse effects on health. For this reason, he recommended the use of clay pipes and masonry channels in the provision of piped drinking-water.\nVitruvius is the source for the anecdote that credits Archimedes with the discovery of the mass-to-volume ratio while relaxing in his bath. Having been asked to investigate the suspected adulteration of the gold used to make a crown, Archimedes realised that the crown's volume could be measured exactly by its displacement of water, and ran into the street with the cry of\" Eureka!\"\nDewatering machines.\nHe describes the construction of Archimedes' screw in Chapter X (without mentioning Archimedes by name). It was a device widely used for raising water to irrigate fields and drain mines. Other lifting machines he mentions include the endless chain of buckets and the reverse overshot water-wheel. Remains of the water wheels used for lifting water were discovered when old mines were re-opened at Rio Tinto in Spain, Rosia Montana in Romania and Dolaucothi in west Wales. The Rio Tinto wheel is now shown in the British Museum, and the Dolaucothi specimen in the National Museum of Wales.\nSurveying instruments.\nThat he must have been well practised in surveying is shown by his descriptions of surveying instruments, especially the water level or \"chorobates,\" which he compares favourably with the \"groma,\" a device using plumb lines. They were essential in all building operations, but especially in aqueduct construction, where a uniform gradient was important to the provision of a regular supply of water without damage to the walls of the channel. He also developed one of the first odometers, consisting of a wheel of known circumference that dropped a pebble into a container on every rotation.\nCentral heating.\nHe describes the many innovations made in building design to improve the living conditions of the inhabitants. Foremost among them is the development of the \"hypocaust,\" a type of central heating where hot air developed by a fire was channelled under the floor and inside the walls of public baths and villas. He gives explicit instructions how to design such buildings so that fuel efficiency is maximised, so that for example, the \"caldarium\" is next to the \"tepidarium\" followed by the \"frigidarium\". He also advises on using a type of regulator to control the heat in the hot rooms, a bronze disc set into the roof under a circular aperture which could be raised or lowered by a pulley to adjust the ventilation. Although he does not suggest it himself, it is likely that his dewatering devices such as the reverse overshot water-wheel were used in the larger baths to lift water to header tanks at the top of the larger \"thermae\", such as the Baths of Diocletian. The one which was used in Bath of Caracalla for grinding flour.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Fantasy Games Unlimited published the first edition of \"Villains and Vigilantes\" in 1979. The second edition of \"Villains and Vigilantes\" was published in 1982 with significant rule revisions. In 2010, Monkey House Games published a new edition of the game, although a lawsuit filed in U.S. Federal court, Arizona District, (Case no. 2:2011-cv-02036) asserted that Monkey House Games had no legal right to do so. That lawsuit has since been resolved and a settlement agreed upon with both parties producing their own material.\nMechanics.\nCharacter creation in \"Villains and Vigilantes\" reflects the unique nature of the rules. Instead of playing a completely fictional character, players are encouraged to start the process with a version of themselves (presumably as the superhero's \"secret identity.\") \"V&amp;V\" then uses random die rolls for the origins of superpowers (i.e., mutant, space alien, etc.) number and type, sometimes resulting in odd combinations. A further quirk of the system is that while players advance in levels and hit points, superpowers do not, lending a different feel to characters at low, middle, and high power levels. Character stats in the first edition of the game are strength, endurance, agility, intelligence, and charisma.\nAnother feature of the system is its approach to combat: a table outlines the effectiveness of the attacker's superpower (for example, an energy blast) against the defender's powers, reflecting the interplay of attack and defense powers.\nPublication history.\nThe first edition was created by Jeff Dee and Jack Herman and published by Fantasy Games Unlimited in 1979. This book was followed by an adventure published in 1981, \"Break In at Three Kilometer Island\", and a pair of adventures in 1982 designed specifically to be playable with the original ruleset, but to begin to introduce players to the revised second edition which was published later the same year. These two adventures were authored by Bill Willingham, the creator of the \"Fables\" comic book series. Willingham's adventures also used characters that would later appear in his comic book series, \"Elementals\".\nThe second edition of Villains &amp; Vigilantes, created by the same authors and also published by Fantasy Games Unlimited, was released in 1982 in two formats, both as a single rulebook and in a boxed set that contained the revised rulebook, GM's screen, dice and character sheets. These were followed by a line of adventure module and rule supplements published through the '80s until the final supplement published in 1987, \"For the Greater Good\".\nIn 2004, Fantasy Games Unlimited began republishing the original \"V&amp;V\" rules and supplements as a series of electronic supplements via the DriveThruRPG online store, continuing to add supplements until nearly the entire back catalog is now available.\nIn 2010, the creators of the game released a new revised version, version 2.1, published through Monkey House Games. This has caused ongoing legal disputes. That same year, Fantasy Games Unlimited began releasing new supplements for \"2nd Edition Villains and Vigilantes\", for the first time since 1987, while Monkey House Games continued to release supplements of its own. Both companies continue to sell their products. On April 20, 2016 a resolution has been agreed upon.\nAdventures.\n\"Crisis at Crusader Citadel\" is an introductory adventure published in 1982 by Fantasy Games Unlimited and written and illustrated by Dee and Herman. The scenario begins with the players controlling neophyte superheroes, based on themselves, who are looking to apply for membership in the established super-hero team called the Crusaders. During the adventure, the player-heroes have to stop a crime wave being carried out by the Crusaders' opposite numbers, a villain team called the Crushers.\nFour years after the adventure booklet was published, the setting of the first adventure was used as the basis of a \"Villains and Vigilantes\" comic book limited series by Dee and Herman, published by Eclipse Comics. Each issue included character sheets for new heroes and villains, and updated material for the existing ones for use in the game. (This device was also used in another comic book limited series published by Eclipse, based on the superhero role-playing game the \"Champions\", during the same period.)\nTwo early adventures for the game by Bill Willingham, \"Death Duel with the Destroyers\" and \"The Island of Dr. Apocalypse\", used characters that would later appear in his comic book series \"Elementals\". Similarly, a \"Villains and Vigilantes\" character, The Dark, later appeared in a series of comic books by the independent publisher Contin\u00fcm Comics.\nReception.\nIn the inaugural edition of \"Ares Magazine\" (March 1980), Greg Costikyan commented \"\"Villains &amp; Vigilantes\" is an imaginative, enjoyable game. Its major problem is 'creeping \"D&amp;D\"ism;' most of the game-systems are directly derived from \"D&amp;D\", and are out of place in a superhero rpg. Also, the short rules do not really provide enough background material and world-design advice for a full-scale role-playing game.\" Costikyan gave the game a rating of 6 out of 9.\nIn Issue 29 of \"The Space Gamer\", Marc Weidenbaum wrote, \"\"\"Villains and Vigilantes\" is a good, firm, introductory role-playing game with easy-to-learn rules. If you are a game master from another 'world' you can, with little difficulty, adapt these rules to fit almost any other role-playing game.\"\nCat Francis reviewed \"Villains and Vigilantes\" for \"Pegasus\" magazine and stated that \"\"Villains and Vigilantes\", produced by Fantasy Games Unlimited, is one of the better superhero roleplaying games on the market. The second edition of the game has cleared up a lot of the minor flaws and frustrations from the first edition. The combat system has been made significantly quicker and simpler.\"\nWilliam A. Barton reviewed the revised \"Villains and Vigilantes\" in \"The Space Gamer\" No. 62 and commented \"if you're really into superhero adventure, I'd recommend giving revised \"Villains and Vigilantes\" a try. If you decide you still like \"Champions\" or \"Superworld\" better, well, you can always use \"V&amp;V\" to help you decide what powers to purchase in another system when your superintelligence is on patrol near Arcturus IV.\"\nPaul Ryan O'Connor reviewed \"Villains and Vigilantes\" for \"Different Worlds\" magazine and stated that \"In summation, \"V&amp;V\" carries my highest recommendation. The new second edition is a vast improvement over the original game. \"V&amp;V\" is entertaining to read, and a lot of fun to play. \"V&amp;V\" belongs in every gamer's collection.\"\nIn his 1990 book \"The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games\", game critic Rick Swan commented that since its original appearance more than a decade before, \"\"V&amp;V\" continues to hold its own, thanks to its tongue-in-cheek approach and some genuinely inspired concepts.\" Swan thought the character generation system was the most notable part of the game, but \"The rest of the game, sadly, lacks the elegance of the character-creation rules.\" Swan concluded by giving the game a solid rating of 3 out of 4, saying, \"For those with a little role-playing experience under their belts, \"Vigilantes &amp; Villains\" is a terrific introduction to superhero games.\"\n2011 legal dispute.\nThe game's creators were involved in a legal dispute with Fantasy Games Unlimited since 2011. They claimed that Fantasy Games Unlimited, Inc. ceased to exist in 1991, and that their contract specified that in such an event the contracted publication rights would revert to them, and that therefore the current Fantasy Games Unlimited (which they claim is a separate legal entity, although with the same owner) had no right to sell \"V&amp;V\" material. A court case filed in U.S. Federal court, Arizona district (REFERENCE: case no. 2:2011-cv-02036) supported the claim by Fantasy Games Unlimited that the owner properly followed procedure to continue with the obligations of the New York business entity in continued operations as the Arizona entity. The case also asserted that at the time of its dissolution in New York, FGU was current on all obligations with that state and in good standing which then devolved into the entity now operating simply as Fantasy Games Unlimited.\nA judgment given on July 11, 2012, on the first two counts of case no. 2:2011-cv-02036 in U.S. Federal court, Arizona district ruled in favor of Scott Bizar resulting in Jeff Dee and Jack Herman being found guilty of defamation and unfair business practice and causing unspecified damages to the plaintiff. More judgments on other counts were still pending as of that date. The judgment ordered (not withstanding any other punitive measures to be determined for damages on all counts) the defendants within 30 days to post conspicuously in every place on the internet a retraction/corrective measure where their false statements have been posted.\nIn January 2013, the U.S. District Court of Arizona found that Jeff Dee and Jack Herman own all copyrights to \"Villains and Vigilantes\", including the previously contracted to Fantasy Games Unlimited.

Slightly different definitions are sometimes used. The era followed the Georgian era and preceded the Edwardian era, and its later half overlaps with the first part of the \"Belle \u00c9poque\" era of continental Europe.\nVarious liberalising political reforms took place in the UK, including expanding the electoral franchise. The Great Famine caused mass death in Ireland in the mid 1840s. Britain had peaceful relations with the other great powers. It participated in various military threats and conflicts mainly against minor powers. The Crimean War of the 1850s was against Russia. It was seen as a major threat to the Ottoman ally and to India. The British Empire expanded during this period and the Royal Navy was predominant power in the world.\nVictorian society valued a high standard of personal conduct across all sections of society. The emphasis on morality gave impetus to social reform but also placed restrictions on certain groups' liberty. Prosperity rose during the period, but debilitating undernutrition persisted. Literacy and childhood education became near universal in Great Britain for the first time. Whilst some attempts were made to improve living conditions, slum housing and disease remained a severe problem.\nThe period saw significant scientific and technological development. Britain was advanced in industry and engineering in particular, but somewhat less developed in art and education. Great Britain's population increased rapidly, while Ireland's fell sharply.\nTerminology.\nIn the strictest sense, the Victorian era covers the duration of Victoria's reign as Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, from her accession on 20 June 1837\u2014after the death of her uncle, William IV\u2014until her death on 22 January 1901, after which she was succeeded by her eldest son, Edward VII. Her reign lasted 63 years and seven months, a longer period than any of her predecessors. The term 'Victorian' was in contemporaneous usage to describe the era. The era can also be understood in a more extensive sense\u2014the 'long Victorian era'\u2014as a period that possessed sensibilities and characteristics distinct from the periods adjacent to it, in which case it is sometimes dated to begin before Victoria's accession\u2014typically from the passage of or agitation for (during the 1830s) the Reform Act 1832, which introduced a wide-ranging change to the electoral system of England and Wales. Definitions that purport a distinct sensibility or politics to the era have also created scepticism about the worth of the label 'Victorian', though there have also been defences of it.\nVictorian subperiods.\nThe interwar period between the Napoleonic Wars (1815) and World War I (1914) is often broadly seen as an age of peace, progress, and political liberalism. However, the Queen's 64-year reign created an illusion of continuous uniformity, masking significant shifts in ideas, manners, and values. Michael Sadleir was insistent that \"in truth, the Victorian period is three periods, and not one\". He distinguished early Victorianism\u2014the socially and politically unsettled period from 1837 to 1850\u2014and late Victorianism (from 1880 onwards), with its new waves of aestheticism and imperialism, from the Victorian heyday: mid-Victorianism, 1851 to the 1870s. He saw the middle period as characterised by a distinctive mixture of prosperity, domestic prudery, and complacency\u2014what G. M. Trevelyan called the 'mid-Victorian decades of quiet politics and roaring prosperity'. Harold Schultz has summarized the typical three-part periodization used by scholars.\nEarly Victorianism (1815-1850)\nDriven by the revolutionary ideas from America and France, as well as the convictions of English utilitarians and Evangelicals, Britain began a process of gradual democratization. The national government and society adapted to absorb this \"democratic radicalism.\" Simultaneously with this political change, England became a world leader in both opinion and, more practically, in industrialization and the production of manufactured goods. By mid-century, Britain was at the height of its power, confident that its economic prosperity, founded on free trade and parliamentary institutions, would ensure happiness and peace.\nMid-Victorianism (1850-1870s)\nThis was the height of Victorian self-assurance, characterized by a strong sense of duty and unwavering belief in political Liberalism. British industrial and naval power was frequently used to promote liberalism abroad, while domestically, the focus was on individual freedom. Though some contemporary critics attacked the era's bourgeois values and easy supremacy, the prevailing faith in the inevitability of progress remained firm, assuring the nation its problems would be solved and its greatness maintained. For an educated Englishman, holding a seat in Parliament represented the highest possible aspiration.\nLate Victorianism (1880-1914)\nThe unchallenged supremacy that defined the mid-century began to erode. Britain's industrial and commercial dominance faced new competition, and the Pax Britannica (British Peace) was jeopardized by militarism and industrial rivalry from other nations that had not embraced free trade or parliamentary democracy. As a result, core mid-Victorian values\u2014such as liberalism, free trade, political compromise, and moral rectitude\u2014were undermined. They failed to guarantee security for the average English citizen in a world now defined by aggressive nationalism and impersonal economic forces. This search for a new direction led to a rejection of ancient values and institutions. Powerful new social and political movements, including trade unionism and the demand for women's suffrage, rose to prominence and demanded recognition.\nPolitics and foreign affairs.\nThe Reform Act, which made various changes to the electoral system, including expanding the franchise, was passed in 1832. The franchise was expanded again by the Second Reform Act in 1867. The Third Reform Act in 1884 introduced a general principle of one vote per household. All these acts, along with others, simplified the electoral system and reduced corruption. Historian Bruce L Kinzer describes these reforms as putting the United Kingdom on the path towards becoming a democracy. The traditional aristocratic ruling class attempted to maintain as much influence as possible while gradually allowing the middle- and working-classes a role in politics. However, all women and a large minority of men remained outside the system into the early 20th century.\nCities were given greater political autonomy and the labour movement was legalised. From 1845 to 1852, the Potato Famine caused mass starvation, disease and death in Ireland, sparking large-scale emigration. Across the British Empire, reform included rapid expansion of the zone of control, the complete abolition of slavery in the African possessions and the end of transportation of convicts to Australia. Restrictions on colonial trade were loosened, and a responsible (i.e., semi-autonomous) government was introduced in some territories.\nThroughout most of the 19th century, Britain was the most powerful country in the world. The period from 1815 to 1914, known as the Pax Britannica, was a time of relatively peaceful relations between the world's great powers. This is particularly true of Britain's interactions with the others. The only war in which the British Empire fought against another major power was the Crimean War, from 1853 to 1856. There were various revolts and violent conflicts within the British Empire, and Britain participated in wars against minor powers. It also took part in the diplomatic struggles of the Great Game and the Scramble for Africa.\nIn 1840, Queen Victoria married her German cousin Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. The couple had nine children, who themselves married into various royal families, and the queen thus became known as the 'grandmother of Europe'. In 1861, Albert died. Victoria went into mourning and withdrew from public life for ten years. In 1871, with republican sentiments growing in Britain, she began to return to public life. In her later years, her popularity soared as she became a symbol of the British Empire. Queen Victoria died on 22 January 1901.\nCorn Law repeal 1846.\nThe Corn Laws were tariffs enforced between 1815 and 1846 on grains (called \"corn\" and including maize, wheat, oats and barley) imported into the United Kingdom. They raised food prices for everyone and benefited wealthy landholders by limiting corn imports when prices were low. The Corn Laws enhanced the profits and political power associated with land ownership. The laws raised the cost of living for the British public and diverted money away from industry.\nThe laws became the focus of intense opposition from urban groups who had far less political power than rural landowners.The first two years of the Great Famine in Ireland of 1845\u20131852 forced a resolution because of the urgent need for new food supplies. Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel played the decisive role. After the defeat of the Tory Party in 1830, he rebuilt the party, renamed it the Conservative Party, and led it to victory in 1841. He now favored Parliament repealing the Corn Laws, and used a third of the Conservative MPs and all of the Whigs to pass the legislation in 1846. Soon, on the Irish issue, the Conservatives lost the 1847 election; Peel never held high office again.\nThe repeal was a decisive shift towards free trade in Britain over the next half-century. The repeal benefited the bottom 90% of income earners economically, while causing income losses for the top 10%.\nSociety and culture.\nFamily life.\nThe Victorian era saw a rapidly growing middle class who became an important cultural influence, to a significant extent replacing the aristocracy as British society's dominant class. A distinctive middle-class lifestyle developed that influenced what society valued as a whole.\"\" Increased importance was placed on the value of the family, and the idea that marriage should be based on romantic love gained popularity. A clear separation was established between the home and the workplace, which had often not been the case before.\"\" The home was seen as a private environment,\"\" where housewives provided their husbands with a respite from the troubles of the outside world. Within this ideal, women were expected to focus on domestic matters and to rely on men as breadwinners. Women had limited legal rights in most areas of life, and a feminist movement developed. Parental authority was seen as important, but children were given legal protections against abuse and neglect for the first time towards the end of the period. Access to education increased rapidly during the 19th century. State-funded schools were established in England and Wales for the first time. Education became compulsory for pre-teenaged children in England, Scotland and Wales. Literacy rates increased rapidly and had become nearly universal by the end of the century. Private education for wealthier children, boys and more gradually girls, became more formalised over the course of the century.\nReligion and social issues.\nThe growing middle class and the strong evangelical movement placed great emphasis on a respectable, moral code of behaviour. This included features such as charity, personal responsibility, controlled habits, , child discipline and self-criticism. As well as personal improvement, importance was given to social reform. Utilitarianism was another philosophy that saw itself as based on science rather than on morality, but also emphasised social progress. An alliance formed between these two ideological strands. The reformers emphasised causes such as improving the conditions of women and children, giving police reform priority over harsh punishment to prevent crime, religious equality, and political reform in order to establish a democracy. The political legacy of the reform movement was to link the nonconformists (part of the evangelical movement) in England and Wales with the Liberal Party. This continued until the First World War. The Presbyterians played a similar role as a religious voice for reform in Scotland.\nReligion was politically controversial during this era, with Nonconformists pushing for the disestablishment of the Church of England. Nonconformists comprised about half of church attendees in England in 1851, and gradually the legal discrimination that had been established against them outside of Scotland was removed. Legal restrictions on Roman Catholics were also largely removed. The number of Catholics grew in Great Britain due to conversions and immigration from Ireland. Secularism and doubts about the accuracy of the Old Testament grew among people with higher levels of education. Northern English and Scottish academics tended to be more religiously conservative, whilst agnosticism and even atheism (though its promotion was illegal) gained appeal among academics in the south. Historians refer to a 'Victorian Crisis of Faith', a period when religious views had to readjust to accommodate new scientific knowledge and criticism of the Bible.\nPopular culture.\nA variety of reading materials grew in popularity during the period, including novels, women's magazines, children's literature, and newspapers. Much literature, including chapbooks, was distributed on the street. Music was also very popular, with genres such as folk music, broadsides, music halls, brass bands, theater music and choral music having mass appeal. What is now called classical music was somewhat undeveloped compared to parts of Europe, but did have significant support. Many sports were introduced or popularised during the Victorian era. They became important to male identity. Examples included cricket, football, rugby, tennis and cycling. The idea of women participating in sport did not fit well with the Victorian view of femininity, but their involvement did increase as the period progressed.\nFor the middle classes, many leisure activities such as tables games could be done in the home while domestic holidays to rural locations such as the Lake District and Scottish Highlands were increasingly practical. The working classes had their own culture separate from that of their richer counterparts, various cheaper forms of entertainment and recreational activities provided by philanthropy. Trips to resorts such as Blackpool were increasingly popular towards the end of the period. Photography became an increasingly accessible and popular part of everyday life. Initially the industrial revolution increased working hours, but over the course of the 19th century a variety of political and economic changes caused them to fall back down to and in some cases below pre-industrial levels, creating more time for leisure.\nNewspapers.\nA series of developments, 1850-1890, transformed the small, closed newspaper world into big business. From 1860 to 1910 was the \"golden age\" of newspaper publication, with technical advances in printing and communication, the professionalisation of journalism, and the prominence of new owners. Political leaders tried to manipulate the press to varying degrees. According to Andrew Marr, four major transitions in the Victorian era created modern British journalism. The stamp tax on every paper sold was removed, enabling newspapers to become profitable by selling advertising. Secondly, new industrial technology enabled the overnight printing of hundreds of thousands of copies for rapid distribution by the new railway system to the entire nation. Next, the educational system was enlarged from a small elite, enabling most people to read newspapers. And finally, Victorians developed mass democracy, making public opinion relevant to the formation of public policy.\nBy the early 19th century, there were 52 London papers and over 100 other titles. As stamp, paper, and other duties were progressively reduced from the 1830s onwards (all duties on newspapers were abolished by 1855), circulation grew massively as major events, and improved communications heightened the public's need for information. \"The Daily Universal Register\" began life in 1785 and later became known as \"The Times\" from 1788. This was the most significant newspaper of the first half of the 19th century, but from around 1860, there were a number of more strongly competitive titles, each differentiated by its political biases and interests.\nEconomy, industry, and trade.\nBefore the Industrial Revolution, daily life had changed little for hundreds of years. The 19th century saw rapid technological development with a wide range of new inventions. This led Great Britain to become the foremost industrial and trading nation of the time. Historians have characterised the mid-Victorian era (1850\u20131870) as Britain's 'Golden Years', with national income per person increasing by half. This prosperity was driven by increased industrialisation, especially in textiles and machinery, along with exports to the empire and elsewhere. The positive economic conditions, as well as a fashion among employers for providing welfare services to their workers, led to relative social stability. The Chartist movement for working-class men to be given the right to vote, which had been prominent in the early Victorian period, dissipated. Government involvement in the economy was limited. Only in the post-World War II period, around a century later, did the country experience substantial economic growth again. But whilst industry was well developed, education and the arts were mediocre. Wage rates continued to improve in the later 19th century: real wages (after taking inflation into account) were 65 per cent higher in 1901 compared to 1871. Much of the money was saved, as the number of depositors in savings banks rose from 430,000 in 1831 to 5.2\u00a0million in 1887, and their deposits from \u00a314 million to over \u00a390 million.\nChild labour.\nChildren had always played a role in economic life but exploitation of their labour became especially intense during the Victorian era. Children were put to work in a wide range of occupations, but particularly associated with this period are factories. Employing children had advantages, as they were cheap, had limited ability to resist harsh working conditions, and could enter spaces too small for adults. Some accounts exist of happy upbringings involving child labour, but conditions were generally poor. Pay was low, punishments severe, work was dangerous and disrupted children's development (often leaving them too tired to play even in their free time). Early labour could do lifelong harm; even in the 1960s and '70s, the elderly people of industrial towns were noted for their often unusually short stature, deformed physiques, and diseases associated with unhealthy working conditions. Reformers wanted the children in school. By the 1850s, around half of the children in England and Wales were in school (not including Sunday school). From the 1833 Factory Act onwards, attempts were made to get child labourers into part time education, though this was often difficult to achieve. Only in the 1870s and 1880s did children begin to be compelled into school. Work continued to inhibit children's schooling into the early 20th century.\nHousing and public health.\nBritain saw rapid urbanisation stimulated by the Industrial Revolution. In the 1901 census, more than three out of every four people were classified as living in an urban area, compared to one in five a century earlier. Historian Richard A. Soloway wrote that \"Great Britain had become the most urbanized country in the West.\" The rapid growth in the urban population included the new industrial and manufacturing cities, as well as service centres such as Edinburgh and London. Private renting from housing landlords was the dominant tenure. P. Kemp says this was usually of advantage to tenants. Overcrowding was a major problem with seven or eight people frequently sleeping in a single room. Until at least the 1880s, sanitation was inadequate in areas such as water supply and disposal of sewage. This all had a negative effect on health, especially that of the impoverished young. For instance, of the babies born in Liverpool in 1851, only 45 per cent survived to age 20. Conditions were particularly bad in London, where the population rose sharply and poorly maintained, overcrowded dwellings became slum housing. Kellow Chesney wrote of the situation:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Hideous slums, some of them acres wide, some no more than crannies of obscure misery, make up a substantial part of the metropolis... In big, once handsome houses, thirty or more people of all ages may inhabit a single room\nHunger and poor diet was a common aspect of life across the UK in the Victorian period, especially in the 1840s, but the mass starvation seen in the Great Famine in Ireland was unique. Levels of poverty fell significantly during the 19th century from as much as two thirds of the population in 1800 to less than a third by 1901. However, 1890s studies suggested that almost 10% of the urban population lived in a state of desperation lacking the food necessary to maintain basic physical functions. Attitudes towards the poor were often unsympathetic and they were frequently blamed for their situation. In that spirit, the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 had been deliberately designed to punish them and would remain the basis for welfare provision into the 20th century. While many people were prone to vices, not least alcoholism, historian Bernard A. Cook argues that the main reason for 19th century poverty was that typical wages for much of the population were simply too low. Barely enough to provide a subsistence living in good times, let alone save up for bad.\nImprovements were made over time to housing along with the management of sewage and water eventually giving the UK the most advanced system of public health protection anywhere in the world. The quality and safety of household lighting improved over the period with oil lamps becoming the norm in the early 1860s, gas lighting in the 1890s and electric lights beginning to appear in the homes of the richest by the end of the period. Medicine advanced rapidly during the 19th century and germ theory was developed for the first time. Doctors became more specialised and the number of hospitals grew. The overall number of deaths fell by about 20%. The life expectancy of women increased from around 42 to 55 and 40 to 56 for men. In spite of this, the mortality rate fell only marginally, from 20.8 per thousand in 1850 to 18.2 by the end of the century. Urbanisation aided the spread of diseases and squalid living conditions in many places exacerbated the problem. The population of England, Scotland and Wales grew rapidly during the 19th century. Various factors are considered contributary to this, including a rising fertility rate (though it was falling by the end of the period), the lack of a catastrophic pandemic or famine in the island of Great Britain during the 19th century for the first time in history, improved nutrition, and a lower overall mortality rate. Ireland's population shrank significantly, mostly due to emigration and the Great Famine.\nKnowledge.\nScience.\nThe professionalisation of scientific study began in parts of Europe following the French Revolution but was slow to reach Britain. William Whewell coined the term 'scientist' in 1833 to refer to those who studied what was generally then known as natural philosophy, but it took a while to catch on. Having been previously dominated by amateurs with a separate income, the Royal Society admitted only professionals from 1847 onwards. The British biologist Thomas Henry Huxley indicated in 1852 that it remained difficult to earn a living as a scientist alone. Scientific knowledge and debates such as that about Charles Darwin's \"On the Origin of Species\" (1859), which sought to explain biological evolution by natural selection, gained a high profile in the public consciousness. Simplified (and at times inaccurate) popular science was increasingly distributed through a variety of publications which caused tension with the professionals. There were significant advances in various fields of research, including statistics, elasticity, refrigeration, natural history, electromagnetism, and logic.\nIndustry.\nKnown as the 'workshop of the world', Britain was uniquely advanced in technology in the mid-19th century. Engineering, having developed into a profession in the 18th century, gained new profile and prestige in this period. The Victorian era saw methods of communication and transportation develop significantly. In 1837, William Fothergill Cooke and Charles Wheatstone invented the first telegraph system. This system, which used electrical currents to transmit coded messages, quickly spread across Britain, appearing in every town and post office. A worldwide network developed towards the end of the century. In 1876, an American patented the telephone. A little over a decade later, 26,000 telephones were in service in Britain. Multiple switchboards were installed in every major town and city. Guglielmo Marconi developed early radio broadcasting at the end of the period. The railways were important economically in the Victorian era, allowing goods, raw materials, and people to be moved around, stimulating trade and industry. They were also a major employer and industry in their own right.\nMoral standards.\nExpected standards of personal conduct changed in around the first half of the 19th century, with good manners and self-restraint becoming much more common. Historians have suggested various contributing factors, such as Britain's major conflicts with France during the early 19th century, meaning that the distracting temptations of sinful behaviour had to be avoided in order to focus on the war effort, and the evangelical movement's push for moral improvement. There is evidence that the expected standards of moral behaviour were reflected in action as well as rhetoric across all classes of society. For instance, an analysis suggested that less than 5% of working class couples cohabited before marriage.\nHistorian Harold Perkin argued that the change in moral standards led by the middle of the 19th century to 'diminished cruelty to animals, criminals, lunatics, and children (in that order)'. Legal restrictions were placed on cruelty to animals. Restrictions were placed on the working hours of child labourers in the 1830s and 1840s. Further interventions took place throughout the century to increase the level of child protection. Use of the death penalty also decreased. Crime rates fell significantly in the second half of the 19th century. Sociologist Christie Davies linked this change to attempts to morally educate the population, especially at Sunday schools.\nSexual behaviour.\nContrary to popular belief, Victorian society understood that both men and women enjoyed copulation. Chastity was expected of women, whilst attitudes to male sexual behaviour were more relaxed. The development of police forces led to a rise in prosecutions for illegal sodomy in the middle of the 19th century. Male sexuality became a favourite subject of medical researchers' study. For the first time, all male homosexual acts were outlawed. Concern about sexual exploitation of adolescent girls increased during the period, especially following the white slavery scandal, which contributed to the increasing of the age of consent from 13 to 16.\nAt a time when job options for women were limited and generally low-paying, some women, particularly those without familial support, took to prostitution to support themselves. Attitudes in public life and among the general population to prostitution varied. Evidence about prostitutes' situation also varies. One contemporary study argues that the trade was a short-term stepping stone to a different lifestyle for many women, while another, more recent study argues they were subject to physical abuse, financial exploitation, state persecution, and difficult working conditions. Due to worries about venereal disease, especially among soldiers, women suspected of prostitution were for a period between the 1860s and 1880s subject to spot compulsory examinations for sexually transmitted infections, and detainment if they were found to be infected. This caused a great deal of resentment among women in general due to the principle underlying the checks, that women had to be controlled in order to be safe for sexual use by men, and the checks were opposed by some of the earliest feminist campaigning.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It extends the Bayer designation format, with an identifying label (as described below) preceding the Latin genitive of the name of the constellation in which the star lies. The identifying label can be one or two Latin letters or a \"V\" plus a number (e.g. V399). Examples are R Coronae Borealis, YZ Ceti, V603 Aquilae. (\"See\" List of constellations \"for a list of constellations and the genitive forms of their names\".)\nNaming.\nThe current naming system is:\nHistory.\nIn the early 19th\u00a0century few variable stars were known, so it seemed reasonable to use the letters of the Latin script. Because very few constellations contained stars with uppercase Latin-letter Bayer designation greater than Q, the letter R was chosen as a starting point so as to avoid confusion with letter spectral types or the (now rarely used) Latin-letter Bayer designations. Although Lacaille had used uppercase R\u2013Z\u00a0letters in a few cases, for example X\u00a0Puppis (HR\u00a02548), these designations were either dropped or accepted as variable star designations. The star T\u00a0Puppis was accepted by Argelander as a variable star and is included in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars with that designation but is now classed as non-variable.\nThis variable star naming convention was developed by Friedrich W. Argelander. There is a widespread belief according to which Argelander chose the letter\u00a0R for German \"rot\" or French \"rouge\", both meaning \"red\", because many variable stars known at that time appear red. However, Argelander's own statement disproves this.\nBy 1836, even the letter\u00a0S had only been used in one constellation, Serpens. With the advent of photography the number of variables piled up quickly, and variable star names soon fell into the Bayer-trap of reaching the end of the alphabet while still having stars to name. After two subsequent supplementary double-lettering systems hit similar limits, numbers were finally introduced.\nIn 1865, G. F. Chambers published a catalogue of 123 variables, all but one of which had a variable star designation in the Argelander scheme. The following year, E. Sch\u00f6nfeld published a variable star catalogue with 112 entries; most used the same scheme. This catalogue would not be updated until 1888, when S. C. Chandler published an update. He released two more updates to this catalogue in 1893 and 1896. The German Astronomical Society then took over the task of maintaining variable star identifiers by publishing annual updates in the \"Astronomische Nachrichten\" journal.\nAs with all categories of astronomical objects, names are now assigned by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). Since 1946, the IAU has delegated this task to the Sternberg Astronomical Institute and the Institute of Astronomy of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow, Russia. Sternberg publishes the \"General Catalog of Variable Stars\" (GCVS), which is amended approximately once every two years by the publication of a new \"Name-List of Variable Stars\". For example, in December\u00a02011, the 80th \"Name-List of Variable Stars\", Part\u00a0II, was released, containing designations for 2,161\u00a0recently discovered variable stars, which brought the total number in the GCVS to 45,678\u00a0variable stars. Among the newly designated objects were V0654\u00a0Aurigae, V1367\u00a0Centauri, and BU\u00a0Coronae Borealis.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

After surrendering to Caesar and spending almost six years in prison, he was executed in Rome.\nVercingetorix was the son of Celtillus the Arvernian, leader of the Gallic tribes. Vercingetorix came to power after his formal designation as chieftain of the Arverni at the \"oppidum\" Gergovia in 52 BC. He immediately established an alliance with other Gallic tribes, took command, combined all forces, and led them in the Celts' most significant revolt against Roman power. He won the Battle of Gergovia against Julius Caesar in which several thousand Romans and their allies were killed, and the Roman legions withdrew.\nCaesar had been able to exploit Gaulish internal divisions to easily subjugate the country, since Vercingetorix's attempt to unite the Gauls against Roman invasion came too late. At the Battle of Alesia in 52 BC the Romans besieged and defeated his forces. To spare as many of his men as possible, he gave himself to the Romans. He was held prisoner for five years. In 46 BC as part of Caesar's triumph, he was paraded through the streets of Rome and then executed by garrote. Vercingetorix is primarily known through Caesar's (\"Commentaries on the Gallic War\"). He is considered a folk hero in France, and especially in Auvergne, his native region.\nName.\nThe Gaulish name can be literally translated as victorious, great king, or leader of warriors, from (over, superior) + (warrior, hero) + (king), but it mainly means victorious [Vercingetorix free English translation = Victor = victorious]. Scholar Maigr\u00e9ad N\u00ed C. Dobbs has proposed to see an Irish cognate of the name in the form . In his \"Life of Caesar\", Plutarch renders the name as (). According to Florus he was \"endowed [...] with a name which seemed to be intended to inspire terror\".\nEarly life.\nHaving been appointed governor of the Roman province of Gallia Narbonensis (modern Provence) in 58\u00a0BC, Julius Caesar proceeded to conquer the surrounding Gallic tribes over the next few years, maintaining control through a careful divide-and-rule strategy. He made use of the factionalism among the Gallic elites, favouring certain noblemen over others with political support and Roman luxuries such as wine. Attempts at revolt, such as that of Ambiorix in 54\u00a0BC, had secured only local support, but Vercingetorix, whose father Celtillus had been put to death by his own countrymen for seeking to rule all of Gaul, managed to unify the Gallic tribes against the Romans and adopted more current styles of warfare.\nAverni nobleman.\nThe revolt that Vercingetorix came to lead began in early 52\u00a0BC while Caesar was raising troops in Cisalpine Gaul. Believing that Caesar would be distracted by the turmoil in Rome following the death of Publius Clodius Pulcher, the Carnutes under Cotuatus and Conetodunus made the first move, slaughtering the Romans who had settled in their territory.\nVercingetorix, a young nobleman of the Arvernian city of Gergovia, roused his dependents to join the revolt, but his followers and he were expelled by Vercingetorix's uncle Gobannitio and the rest of the nobles because they thought that opposing Caesar was too great a risk. Undeterred, Vercingetorix raised an army of the poor, took Gergovia, and was hailed as king.\nWar with Rome.\nVercingetorix made alliances with other tribes and united Gaul under the pretense of escaping Roman rule. After having been unanimously given supreme command of their armies, he imposed his authority through harsh discipline and the taking of hostages. Leadership and unification on this level were unprecedented in Gaul and would not happen again for decades.\nHe adopted a policy of retreating to natural fortifications and undertook an early example of a scorched earth strategy by burning towns to prevent the Roman legions from living off the land. Vercingetorix scorched much of the land marching north with his army from Gergovia in an attempt to deprive Caesar of the resources and safe haven of the towns and villages along Caesar's march south.\nSiege of Avaricum.\nAvaricum (the capital of the Bituriges, near modern-day Bourges) was spared, even though it lay directly in Caesar's path. Because of the town's strong protests, naturally defensible terrain, and apparently strong, man-made reinforcing defenses, Vercingetorix decided against razing and burning it. Vercingetorix camped well outside of Avaricum and focused on conducting harassing engagements of the advancing Roman units led by Caesar and his chief lieutenant Titus Labienus. Upon reaching Avaricum the Romans laid siege and captured the capital. Afterwards, in a reprisal for 25 days of hunger and of laboring over the siegeworks required to breach Avaricum's defenses, the Romans slaughtered nearly the entire population, some 40,000 people, leaving only about 800 alive.\nBattle of Gergovia.\nAt the Battle of Gergovia, capital city of the Arverni, Vercingetorix and his warriors crushed Caesar's legions and allies, inflicting heavy losses. Vercingetorix then decided to follow Caesar but suffered heavy losses (as did the Romans and their allies) during a cavalry battle, and he retreated and moved to a stronghold at Alesia.\nBattle of Alesia.\nIn the Battle of Alesia in September 52\u00a0BC, Caesar built a fortification around the city to besiege it. However, Vercingetorix had summoned his Gallic allies to attack the besieging Romans. These forces included an army of Arverni led by Vercingetorix's cousin Vercassivellaunos and an army of 10,000 Lemovices led by Sedullos. With the Roman circumvallation surrounded by the rest of Gaul, Caesar built another outward-facing fortification (a contravallation) against the expected relief armies, resulting in a doughnut-shaped fortification. The Gallic relief came in insufficient numbers; estimates range from 80,000 to 250,000 soldiers. Vercingetorix, the tactical leader, was cut off from those on the inside, and without his guidance the attacks were initially unsuccessful. The attacks did reveal a weak point in the fortifications though, and the combined forces on the inside and the outside almost made a breakthrough. Only when Caesar personally led the last reserves into battle did he finally manage to prevail. This was a decisive battle in the creation of the Roman Empire.\nAccording to Plutarch, \"Caes\". 27.8-10, Vercingetorix surrendered in a dramatic fashion, riding his beautifully adorned horse out of Alesia and around Caesar's camp before dismounting in front of Caesar, stripping himself of his armor and sitting down at his opponent's feet, where he remained motionless until he was taken away. Caesar provides a first-hand contradiction of this account, \"De Bell. Gal\". 7.89, describing Vercingetorix's surrender much more modestly.\nImprisonment and death.\nVercingetorix was imprisoned in the Tullianum in Rome for almost six years before being publicly displayed in the first of Caesar's four triumphs in 46\u00a0BC. He was ceremonially beheaded at the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus after the triumph.\nLegacy.\nMemorials.\nNapoleon III erected a Vercingetorix Monument in 1865, created by sculptor Aim\u00e9 Millet, on the supposed site of Alesia. The architect for the memorial was Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc. The statue still stands. The inscription on the base, written by Viollet-le-Duc, which copied the famous statement of Julius Caesar, reads (in French):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nMany other monumental statues of Vercingetorix were erected in France during the 19th century, including one by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bartholdi on the Place de Jaude in Clermont-Ferrand.\nAsteroid 52963 Vercingetorix, discovered by the OCA\u2013DLR Asteroid Survey, was named in his honor.\nMedia.\nThe 1962 Italian movie \"Caesar the Conqueror\", starring Rik Battaglia as Vercingetorix and Cameron Mitchell as Julius Caesar. The movie centers around Caesar's battles with the Gauls, as well as his political battling in Rome. The movie ends with the Battle of Alesia and Vercingetorix's subsequent surrender. \nThe 2001 French film \"Druids\", starring Christopher Lambert as Vercingetorix and Klaus Maria Brandauer as Julius Caesar, depicts the Gallic chieftain's struggle against Caesar. The film is infamous in France for its poor quality and dismal box-office performance. The script was written by Norman Spinrad, who also authored the novelization \"The Druid King\".\nJoseph Canteloube composed an opera, \"Vercing\u00e9torix\", about the defeat of the Gauls by Julius Caesar. The libretto was by \u00c9tienne Cl\u00e9mentel. The Paris Op\u00e9ra gave the first performance in 1933.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "32807", "revid": "19014806", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32807", "title": "Vocal cords", "text": "Folds of throat tissues that help to create sounds through vocalization\nThe vocal cords, also known as vocal folds, are folds of throat tissues that are key in creating sounds through vocalization. The length of the vocal cords affects the pitch of voice, similar to a violin string. Open when breathing and vibrating for speech or singing, the folds are controlled via the recurrent laryngeal branch of the vagus nerve. They are composed of twin infoldings of mucous membrane stretched horizontally, from back to front, across the larynx. They vibrate, modulating the flow of air being expelled from the lungs during phonation.\nThe 'true vocal cords' are distinguished from the 'false vocal folds', known as vestibular folds or \"ventricular folds\", which sit slightly superior to the more delicate true folds. These have a minimal role in normal phonation, but can produce deep sonorous tones, screams and growls.\nThe length of the vocal fold at birth is approximately six to eight millimeters and grows to its adult length of eight to sixteen millimeters by adolescence. DHT, an androgen metabolite of testosterone which is secreted by the gonads, causes changes in the cartilages and musculature of the larynx when present in high enough concentrations, such as during an adolescent boy's puberty: The thyroid prominence appears, the vocal folds lengthen and become rounded, and the epithelium thickens with the formation of three distinct layers in the lamina propria.. These changes are only partially reversible via reconstructive surgery such as chondrolaryngoplasty, feminization laryngoplasty, and laser tuning of the vocal cords.\nStructure.\nLocation.\nThe vocal folds are located within the larynx at the top of the trachea. They are attached at the back to the arytenoid cartilages, and at the front to the thyroid cartilage via Broyles ligament. They are part of the glottis. Their outer edges are attached to muscle in the larynx while their inner edges form an opening called the rima glottidis. They are constructed from epithelium, but they have a few muscle-fibres in them, namely the vocalis muscle which tightens the front part of the ligament near to the thyroid cartilage. They are flat triangular bands and are pearly white in color. Above both sides of the glottis are the two vestibular folds or false vocal folds which have a small sac between them.\nFalse vocal folds.\nThe vocal folds are sometimes called 'true vocal folds' to distinguish them from the 'false vocal folds' known as vestibular folds or \"ventricular folds\". These are a pair of thick folds of mucous membrane that protect and sit slightly higher to the more delicate true folds. They have a minimal role in normal phonation, but are often used to produce deep sonorous tones in Tibetan chant and Tuvan throat singing, as well as in musical screaming and the death growl vocal style.\nMicroanatomy.\nThe vocal cords are composed of twin infoldings of 3 distinct tissues: an outer layer of flat cells that do not produce keratin (squamous epithelium). Below this is the superficial layer of the lamina propria, a gel-like layer, which allows the vocal fold to vibrate and produce sound. The vocalis and thyroarytenoid muscles make up the deepest portion. These vocal folds are covered with a mucous membrane and are stretched horizontally, from back to front, across the larynx.\nVariation.\nMales and females have different vocal fold sizes. Adult male voices are usually lower-pitched due to longer and thicker folds. The male's vocal folds are between 1.75\u00a0cm and 2.5\u00a0cm (approx 0.75\" to 1.0\") in length, while females' vocal folds are between 1.25\u00a0cm and 1.75\u00a0cm (approx 0.5\" to 0.75\") in length. The vocal folds of children are much shorter than those of adult males and females. The difference in vocal fold length and thickness between males and females causes a difference in vocal pitch. Additionally, genetic factors cause variations between members of the same sex, with males' and females' voices being categorized into voice types.\nDevelopment.\nIn newborns.\nNewborns have a uniform single layered lamina propria, which appears loose with no vocal ligament. The monolayered lamina propria is composed of ground substances such as hyaluronic acid and fibronectin, fibroblasts, elastic fibers, and collagenous fibers. While the fibrous components are sparse, making the lamina propria structure loose, the hyaluronic acid (HA) content is high.\nHA is a bulky, negatively charged glycosaminoglycan, whose strong affinity with water procures hyaluronic acid its viscoelastic and shock absorbing properties essential to vocal biomechanics. Viscosity and elasticity are critical to voice production. Chan, Gray and Titze, quantified the effect of hyaluronic acid on both the viscosity and the elasticity of vocal folds by comparing the properties of tissues with and without HA. The results showed that removal of hyaluronic acid decreased the stiffness of the vocal cords by an average of 35%, but increased their dynamic viscosity by an average of 70% at frequencies higher than 1\u00a0Hz. Newborns have been shown to cry an average of 6.7 hours per day during the first 3 months, with a sustained pitch of 400\u2013600\u00a0Hz, and a mean duration per day of 2 hours. Similar treatment on adult vocal cords would quickly result in edema, and subsequently aphonia. Schweinfurth and al. presented the hypothesis that high hyaluronic acid content and distribution in newborn vocal cords is directly associated with newborn crying endurance. These differences in newborn vocal fold composition would also be responsible for newborns inability to articulate sounds, besides the fact that their lamina propria is a uniform structure with no vocal ligament. The layered structure necessary for phonation will start to develop during the infancy and until the adolescence.\nThe fibroblasts in the newborn Reinke's space are immature, showing an oval shape, and a large nucleus-cytoplasm ratio. The rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, as shown by electron micrographs, are not well developed, indicating that the cells are in a resting phase. The collagenous and reticular fibers in the newborn the vocal cords are fewer than in the adult one, adding to the immaturity of the vocal fold tissue.\nIn the infant, many fibrous components were seen to extend from the macula flava towards the Reinke's space. Fibronectin is very abundant in the Reinke's space of newborn and infant. Fibronectin is a glycoprotein that is believed to act as a template for the oriented deposition of the collagen fibers, stabilizing the collagen fibrils. Fibronectin also acts as a skeleton for the elastic tissue formation. Reticular and collagenous fibers were seen to run along the edges of the vocal cords throughout the entire lamina propria. Fibronectin in the Reinke's space appeared to guide those fibers and orient the fibril deposition. The elastic fibers remained sparse and immature during infancy, mostly made of microfibrils. The fibroblasts in the infant Reinke's space were still sparse but spindle-shaped. Their rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus were still not well developed, indicating that despite the change in shape, the fibroblasts still remained mostly in a resting phase. Few newly released materials were seen adjacent to the fibroblasts. The ground substance content in the infant Reinke's space seemed to decrease over time, as the fibrous component content increased, thus slowly changing the vocal fold structure.\nChildren.\nThe infant lamina propria is composed of only one layer, as compared to three in the adult, and there is no vocal ligament. The vocal ligament begins to be present in children at about four years of age. Two layers appear in the lamina propria between the ages of six and twelve, and the mature lamina propria, with the superficial, intermediate and deep layers, is only present by the conclusion of adolescence. As vocal fold vibration is a foundation for vocal formants, this presence or absence of tissue layers influences a difference in the number of formants between the adult and pediatric populations. In females, the voice is three tones lower than the child's and has five to twelve formants, as opposed to the pediatric voice with three to six.\nThe length of the vocal fold at birth is approximately six to eight millimeters and grows to its adult length of eight to sixteen millimeters by adolescence. The infant vocal fold is half membranous or anterior glottis, and half cartilaginous or posterior glottis. The adult fold is approximately three-fifths membranous and two-fifths cartilaginous.\nPuberty.\nPuberty usually lasts from 2 to 5 years, and typically occurs between the ages of 12 and 17. During puberty, voice change is controlled by sex hormones. In females during puberty, the vocal muscle thickens slightly, but remains very supple and narrow. The squamous mucosa also differentiates into three distinct layers (the lamina propria) on the free edge of the vocal folds. The sub- and supraglottic glandular mucosa becomes hormone-dependent to estrogens and progesterone. For females, the actions of estrogens and progesterone produce changes in the extravascular spaces by increasing capillary permeability which allows the passage of intracapillary fluids to the interstitial space as well as modification of glandular secretions. Estrogens have a hypertrophic and proliferative effect on mucosa by reducing the desquamating effect on the superficial layers. The thyroid hormones also affect dynamic function of the vocal folds; (Hashimoto's thyroiditis affects the fluid balance in the vocal folds). Progesterone has an anti-proliferative effect on mucosa and accelerates desquamation. It causes a menstrual-like cycle in the vocal fold epithelium and a drying out of the mucosa with a reduction in secretions of the glandular epithelium. Progesterone has a diuretic effect and decreases capillary permeability, thus trapping the extracellular fluid out of the capillaries and causing tissue congestion.\nTestosterone, an androgen secreted by the testes, will cause changes in the cartilages and musculature of the larynx for males during puberty, and to a lesser extent to females assigned at birth and others such as intersex individuals as well as those who are androgen deficient if they are given masculinizing hormone therapy. In females, androgens are secreted principally by the adrenal cortex and the ovaries and can have irreversible masculinizing effects if present in high enough concentration. In males, they are essential to male sexuality. In muscles, they cause a hypertrophy of striated muscles with a reduction in the fat cells in skeletal muscles, and a reduction in the whole body fatty mass. Androgens are the most important hormones responsible for the passage of the boy-child voice to adult male voice, and the change is irreversible without reconstructive surgery such as feminization laryngoplasty. The thyroid prominence, which contains the vocal cords appears, the vocal folds lengthen and become rounded, and the epithelium thickens with the formation of three distinct layers in the lamina propria. These changes are also irreversible without surgery, albeit the thyroid/laryngeal prominence, also known as an Adam's apple can be potentially diminished via a tracheal shave or feminization laryngoplasty.\nAdulthood.\nHuman vocal cords are paired structures located in the larynx, just above the trachea, which vibrate and are brought in contact during phonation. The human vocal cords are roughly 12\u201324\u00a0mm in length, and 3\u20135\u00a0mm thick. Histologically, the human vocal cords are a laminated structure composed of five different layers. The vocalis muscle, main body of the vocal cords, is covered by the mucosa, which consists of the epithelium and the lamina propria. The latter is a pliable layer of connective tissue subdivided into three layers: the superficial layer (SL), the intermediate layer (IL), and the deep layer (DL). Layer distinction is either made looking at differential in cell content or extracellular matrix (extracellular matrix) content. The most common way being to look at the extracellular matrix content. The SLP has fewer elastic and collagenous fibers than the two other layers, and thus is looser and more pliable. The ILP is mostly composed of elastic fibers, while the DLP has fewer elastic fibers, and more collagenous fibers. In those two layers, which form what is known as the vocalis ligament, the elastic and collagenous fibers are densely packed as bundles that run almost parallel to the edge of the vocal fold.\nThere is a steady increase in the elastin content of the lamina propria as humans age (elastin is a yellow scleroprotein, the essential constituent of the elastic connective tissue) resulting in a decrease in the ability of the lamina propria to expand caused by cross-branching of the elastin fibers. Among other things, this leads to the mature voice being better suited to the rigors of opera.\nThe extracellular matrix of the vocal cord LP is composed of fibrous proteins such as collagen and elastin, and interstitial molecules such as HA, a non-sulfated glycosaminoglycan. While the SLP is rather poor in elastic and collagenous fibers, the ILP and DLP are mostly composed of it, with the concentration of elastic fibers decreasing and the concentration of collagenous fibers increasing as the vocalis muscle is approached. Fibrous proteins and interstitial molecules play different roles within the extracellular matrix. While collagen (mostly type I) provides strength and structural support to the tissue, which are useful to withstanding stress and resisting deformation when subjected to a force, elastin fibers bring elasticity to the tissue, allowing it to return to its original shape after deformation. Interstitial proteins, such as HA, plays important biological and mechanical roles in the vocal cord tissue. In the vocal cord tissue, hyaluronic acid plays a role of shear-thinner, affecting the tissue viscosity, space-filler, shock absorber, as well as wound healing and cell migration promoter. The distribution of those proteins and interstitial molecules has been proven to be affected by both age and gender, and is maintained by the fibroblasts.\nMaturation.\nVocal fold structure in adults is quite different from that in newborns. Exactly how the vocal cord mature from an immature monolayer in newborns to a mature three layer tissue in adults is still unknown, however a few studies have investigated the subjects and brought some answers.\nHirano et al. previously found that the newborns did not have a true lamina propria, but instead had cellular regions called maculae flavae, located at the anterior and posterior ends of the loose vocal fold tissue. Boseley and Hartnick examined at the development and maturation of pediatric human vocal fold lamina propria. Hartnick was the first one to define each layer by a change in their cellular concentration. He also found that the lamina propria monolayer at birth and shortly thereafter was hypercellular, thus confirming Hirano's observations. By 2 months of age, the vocal fold started differentiating into a bilaminar structure of distinct cellular concentration, with the superficial layer being less densely populated than the deeper layer. By 11 months, a three-layered structure starts to be noted in some specimens, again with different cellular population densities. The superficial layer is still hypocellular, followed by an intermediate more hypercellular layer, and a deeper hypercellular layer, just above the vocalis muscle. Even though the vocal cords seem to start organizing, this is not representative of the trilaminar structure seen in adult tissues, where the layer are defined by their differential elastin and collagen fiber compositions. By 7 years of age, all specimens show a three-layered vocal fold structure, based on cellular population densities. At this point, the superficial layer was still hypocellular, the middle layer was the hypercellular one, with also a greater content of elastin and collagen fibers, and the deeper layer was less cellularly populated. Again, the distinction seen between the layers at this stage is not comparable to that seen in the adult tissue. The maturation of the vocal cords did not appear before 13 years of age, where the layers could be defined by their differential fiber composition rather than by their differential cellular population. The pattern now show a hypocellular superficial layer, followed by a middle layer composed predominantly of elastin fiber, and a deeper layer composed predominantly of collagen fibers. This pattern can be seen in older specimens up to 17 years of age, and above. While this study offers a nice way to see the evolution from immature to mature vocal cords, it still does not explain what is the mechanism behind it.\nMaculae flavae.\nMaculae flavae are located at the anterior and posterior ends of the membranous parts of the vocal cords. The histological structure of the macula flava is unique, and Sato and Hirano speculated that it could play an important role in growth, development and aging of the vocal cords. The macula flava is composed of fibroblasts, ground substances, elastic and collagenous fibers. Fibroblasts were numerous and spindle or stellate-shaped. The fibroblasts have been observed to be in active phase, with some newly released amorphous materials present at their surface. From a biomechanical point of view, the role of the macula flava is very important. Hirano and Sato studies suggested that the macula flava is responsible for the synthesis of the fibrous components of the vocal cords. Fibroblasts have been found mostly aligned in the direction of the vocal ligament, along bundles of fibers. It then was suggested that the mechanical stresses during phonation were stimulating the fibroblasts to synthesize those fibers.\nImpact of phonation.\nThe viscoelastic properties of human vocal fold lamina propria are essential for their vibration, and depend on the composition and structure of their extracellular matrix. Adult vocal cords have a layered structure which is based on the layers differential in extracellular matrix distribution. Newborns on the other hand, do not have this layered structure. Their vocal cords are uniform, and immature, making their viscoelastic properties most likely unsuitable for phonation. Hyaluronic acid plays a very important role in the vocal fold biomechanics. In fact, hyaluronic acid has been described as the extracellular matrix molecule that not only contributes to the maintenance of an optimal tissue viscosity that allows phonation, but also of an optimal tissue stiffness that allows frequency control. CD44 is a cell surface receptor for HA. Cells such as fibroblasts are responsible for synthesizing extracellular matrix molecules. Cell surface matrix receptors in return, feed back to the cells through cell-matrix interaction, allowing the cell to regulate its metabolism.\nSato et al. carried out a histopathologic investigation of unphonated human vocal cords. Vocal fold mucosae, which were unphonated since birth, of three young adults (17, 24, and 28 years old) were looked at using light and electron microscopy. The results show that the vocal fold mucosae were hypoplastic, and rudimentary, and like newborns, did not have any vocal ligament, Reinke's space, or layered structure. Like newborns, the lamina propria appeared as a uniform structure. Some stellate cells were present in the macula flava, but started to show some signs of degeneration. The stellate cells synthesized fewer extracellular matrix molecules, and the cytoplasmic processes were shown to be short and shrinking, suggesting a decreased activity. Those results confirm the hypothesis that phonation stimulates stellate cells into producing more extracellular matrix.\nFurthermore, using a specially designed bioreactor, Titze et al. showed that fibroblasts exposed to mechanical stimulation have differing levels of extracellular matrix production from fibroblasts that are not exposed to mechanical stimulation. The gene expression levels of extracellular matrix constituents such as fibronectin, MMP1, decorin, fibromodulin, hyaluronic acid synthase 2, and CD44 were altered. All those genes are involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, thus suggesting that mechanical forces applied to the tissue, alter the expression levels of extracellular matrix related genes, which in turn allow the cells present in the tissue to regulate the extracellular matrix constituent synthesis, thus affecting the tissue's composition, structure, and biomechanical properties. In the end, cell-surface receptors close the loop by giving feedback on the surrounding extracellular matrix to the cells, affecting also their gene expression level.\nImpact of hormones.\nOther studies suggest that hormones play also an important role in vocal fold maturation. Hormones are molecules secreted into the blood stream to be delivered at different targeted sites. They usually promote growth, differentiation and functionality in different organs or tissues. Their effect is due to their ability to bind to intracellular receptors, modulating the gene expression, and subsequently regulating protein synthesis. The interaction between the endocrine system and tissues such as breast, brain, testicles, heart, bones, etc., is being extensively studied. It has clearly been seen that the larynx is somewhat affected by hormonal changes, but, very few studies are working on elucidating this relationship. The effect of hormonal changes in voice is clearly seen when hearing male and female voices, or when listening to a teenage voice changing during puberty. Actually, it is believed that the number of hormonal receptors in the pre-pubertal phase is higher than in any other age. Menstruation has also been seen to influence the voice. In fact, singers are encouraged by their instructors not to perform during their pre-menstrual period, because of a drop in their voice quality.\nVocal fold phonatory functions are known to change from birth to old age. The most significant changes occur in development between birth and puberty, and in old age. Hirano et al. previously described several structural changes associated with aging, in the vocal fold tissue. Some of those changes are: a shortening of the membranous vocal fold in males, a thickening of the vocal fold mucosa and cover in females, and a development of edema in the superficial lamina propria layer in both sexes. Hammond et al. observed that the hyaluronic acid content in the vocal fold lamina propria was significantly higher in males than in females. Although all those studies did show that there are clear structural and functional changes seen in the human vocal cords which are associated with gender and age, none really fully elucidated the underlying cause of those changes. In fact, only a few recent studies started to look at the presence and role of hormone receptors in the vocal cords. Newman et al. found that hormone receptors are indeed present in the vocal cords, and show a statistical distribution difference with respect to age and gender. They have identified the presence of androgen, estrogen, and progesterone receptors in epithelial cells, granular cells and fibroblasts of the vocal cords, suggesting that some of the structural changes seen in the vocal cords could be due to hormonal influences. In this specific study, androgen and progesterone receptors were found more commonly in males than in females. In others studies, it has been suggested that the estrogen/androgen ratio be partly responsible for the voice changes observed at menopause. As previously said, Hammond et al. showed than the hyaluronic acid content was higher in male than in female vocal cords. Bentley et al. demonstrated that sex skin swelling seen in monkey was due to an increase in hyaluronic acid content, which was in fact mediated by estrogen receptors in dermal fibroblasts. An increase in collagen biosynthesis mediated by the estrogen receptors of dermal fibroblasts was also observed. A connection between hormone levels, and extracellular matrix distribution in the vocal cords depending on age and gender could be made. More particularly a connection between higher hormone levels and higher hyaluronic acid content in males could exist in the human vocal fold tissue. Although a relationship between hormone levels and extracellular matrix biosynthesis in vocal fold can be established, the details of this relationship, and the mechanisms of the influence has not been elucidated yet.\nOld age.\nThere is a thinning in the superficial layer of the lamina propria in old age. In aging, the vocal fold undergoes considerable sex-specific changes. In the female larynx, the vocal fold cover thickens with aging. The superficial layer of the lamina propria loses density as it becomes more edematous. The intermediate layer of the lamina propria tends to atrophy only in men. The deep layer of the lamina propria of the male vocal fold thickens because of increased collagen deposits. The vocalis muscle atrophies in both men and women. However, the majority of elderly patients with voice disorders have disease processes associated with aging rather than physiologic aging alone.\nFunction.\nOscillation.\nThe larynx is a major (but not the only) source of sound in speech, generating sound through the rhythmic opening and closing of the vocal folds. To oscillate, the vocal folds are brought near enough together such that air pressure builds up beneath the larynx. The folds are pushed apart by this increased subglottal pressure, with the inferior part of each fold leading the superior part. Such a wave-like motion causes a transfer of energy from the airflow to the fold tissues. Under the correct conditions, the energy transferred to the tissues is large enough to overcome losses by dissipation and the oscillation pattern will sustain itself. In essence, sound is generated in the larynx by chopping up a steady flow of air into little puffs of sound waves.\nThe perceived pitch of a person's voice is determined by a number of different factors, most importantly the fundamental frequency of the sound generated by the larynx. The fundamental frequency is influenced by the length, size, and tension of the vocal folds. This frequency averages about 125 Hz in an adult male, 210\u00a0Hz in adult females, and over 300\u00a0Hz in children. Depth kymography is an imaging method to visualize the complex horizontal and vertical movements of vocal folds.\nThe vocal folds generate a sound rich in harmonics. The harmonics are produced by collisions of the vocal folds with themselves, by recirculation of some of the air back through the trachea, or both. Some singers can isolate some of those harmonics in a way that is perceived as singing in more than one pitch at the same time\u2014a technique called overtone singing or throat singing such as in the tradition of Tuvan throat singing.\nClinical significance.\nLesions.\nThe majority of vocal fold lesions primarily arise in the cover of the folds. Since the basal lamina secures the epithelium to the superficial layer of the lamina propria with anchoring fibers, this is a common site for injury. If a person has a phonotrauma or habitual vocal hyperfunction, also known as pressed phonation, the proteins in the basal lamina can shear, causing vocal fold injury, usually seen as nodules or polyps, which increase the mass and thickness of the cover. The squamous cell epithelium of the anterior glottis are also a frequent site of laryngeal cancer caused by smoking.\nReinke's edema.\nA voice pathology called Reinke's edema, swelling due to abnormal accumulation of fluid, occurs in the superficial lamina propria or Reinke's space. This causes the vocal fold mucosa to appear floppy with excessive movement of the cover that has been described as looking like a loose sock. The greater mass of the vocal folds due to increased fluid lowers the fundamental frequency during phonation.\nWound healing.\nWound healing is a natural regeneration process of dermal and epidermal tissue involving a sequence of biochemical events. These events are complex and can be categorized into three stages: inflammation, proliferation and tissue remodeling. The study on vocal fold wound healing is not as extensive as that on animal models due to the limited availability of human vocal folds. Vocal fold injuries can have a number of causes including chronic overuse, chemical, thermal and mechanical trauma such as smoking, laryngeal cancer, and surgery. Other benign pathological phenomena like polyps, vocal fold nodules and edema will also introduce disordered phonation.\nAny injury to human vocal folds elicits a wound healing process characterized by disorganized collagen deposition and, eventually, formation of scar tissue. Verdolini and her group sought to detect and describe acute tissue response of injured rabbit vocal cord model. They quantified the expression of two biochemical markers: interleukin 1 and prostaglandin E2, which are associated with acute wound healing. They found the secretions of these inflammatory mediators were significantly elevated when collected from injured vocal cords versus normal vocal cords. This result was consistent with their previous study about the function of IL-1 and PGE-2 in wound healing. Investigation about the temporal and magnitude of inflammatory response in the vocal cords may benefit for elucidating subsequent pathological events in vocal fold wounding, which is good for clinician to develop therapeutic targets to minimize scar formation. In the proliferative phase of vocal cord wound healing, if the production of hyaluronic acid and collagen is not balanced, which means the hyaluronic acid level is lower than normal, the fibrosis of collagen cannot be regulated. Consequently, regenerative-type wound healing turns to be the formation of scar. Scarring may lead to the deformity of vocal fold edge, the disruption of lipopolysaccharides viscosity and stiffness. Patients suffering from vocal fold scar complain about increased phonatory effort, vocal fatigue, breathlessness, and dysphonia. Vocal fold scar is one of the most challenging problems for otolaryngologists because it is hard to be diagnosed at germinal stage and the function necessity of vocal cords is delicate.\nTerminology.\nThe vocal folds are commonly referred to as \"vocal cords\", and less commonly as \"vocal flaps\" or \"vocal bands\". The term \"vocal cords\" was coined by the French anatomist Antoine Ferrein in 1741. In his violin analogy of the human voice, he postulated that the moving air acted like a bow on . The alternative spelling in English is \"vocal chords\", possibly due to the musical connotations or to confusion with the geometrical definition of the word \"chord\". While both spellings have historical precedents, standard American spelling is \"cords\". According to the Oxford English Corpus, a database of 21st-century texts that contains everything from academic journal articles to unedited writing and blog entries, contemporary writers opt for the nonstandard \"chords\" instead of \"cords\" 49% of the time. The \"cords\" spelling is also standard in the United Kingdom and Australia.\nIn phonetics, \"vocal folds\" is preferred over \"vocal cords\", on the grounds that it is more accurate and illustrative.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Notable as the first major constructed international auxiliary language, the grammar comes from European languages and the vocabulary mostly from English (with some German and French). However, the roots are often distorted beyond recognition.\nVolap\u00fck conventions took place in 1884 (Friedrichshafen), 1887 (Munich) and 1889 (Paris). The first two conventions used German, and the last conference used only Volap\u00fck. By 1889, there were an estimated 283 clubs, 25 periodicals in or about Volap\u00fck, and 316 textbooks in 25 languages; at that time the language claimed nearly a million adherents. Volap\u00fck was largely displaced between the late 19th and early 20th century by Esperanto.\nHistory.\nSchleyer first published a sketch of Volap\u00fck in May 1879 in \"Sionsharfe\", a Catholic poetry magazine of which he was editor. This was followed in 1880 by a full-length book in German. Schleyer himself did not write books on Volap\u00fck in other languages, but other authors soon did, such as \"Comprehensive Volap\u00fck Grammar\" by Alfred A. Post, \"A Complete Grammar of Volap\u00fck\" by A. K. Linderfelt, and \"A Handbook of Volap\u00fck\" by Andrew Drummond.\nAndr\u00e9 Cherpillod writes of the third Volap\u00fck convention,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe Dutch cryptographer Auguste Kerckhoffs was for a number of years director of the Academy of Volap\u00fck, and introduced the movement to several countries.\nThe French Association for the Propagation of Volap\u00fck was authorized on 8 April 1886, with A. Lourdelet as president and a central committee that included the deputy Edgar Raoul-Duval.\nHowever, tensions arose between Kerckhoffs and others in the Academy, who wanted reforms made to the language, and Schleyer, who insisted strongly on retaining his proprietary rights. This led to schism, with much of the Academy abandoning Schleyer's Volap\u00fck in favor of Idiom Neutral and other new constructed language projects. Another reason for the decline of Volap\u00fck may have been the rise of Esperanto. In 1887 the first Esperanto book (\"Unua Libro\") was published. Many Volap\u00fck clubs became Esperanto clubs.\nBy 1890 the movement was in disarray, with violent arguments among the members. Schleyer resigned from the Volap\u00fck Academy and created a rival academy. Derived languages such as Nal Bino, Balta, Bopal, Spelin, Dil and Orba were invented and quickly forgotten.\nIn the 1920s, Arie de Jong, with the consent of the leaders of the small remnant of Volap\u00fck speakers, made a revision of Volap\u00fck which was published in 1931 (now called \"Volap\u00fck Nulik\" \"New Volap\u00fck\" as opposed to the Volap\u00fck Rigik 'Original Volap\u00fck' of Schleyer). This revision was accepted by the few speakers of the language. De Jong simplified the grammar, eliminating some rarely used verb forms, and eliminated some gendered pronouns and gendered verb endings. He also rehabilitated the phoneme and used it to make some morphemes more recognizable. For instance, \"l\u00f6mib\" \"rain\" became \"rein\".\nVolap\u00fck enjoyed a brief renewal of popularity in the Netherlands and Germany under de Jong's leadership, but was suppressed (along with other constructed languages) in countries under Nazi rule and never recovered.\nRegarding the success of this constructed language, the Spanish scientist Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal wrote in the first edition of his \"Tonics of Willingness\", in 1898:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Nowadays, many scientific papers are published in more than six languages. To the likely attempt of restoring Latin or using Esperanto as the universal language of science, wise men have responded by multiplying the number of languages in which scientific works are published. We have to acknowledge that Volap\u00fck or Esperanto are practically one more language to be learnt. This result was predictable because neither the essentially popularized and democratic tendencies of modern knowledge, nor the economic views of authors and editors consent in a different way.\nHowever, some years later (1920), in the third edition of the same book, he added the following footnote to the former assertion: \"As it was presumable, nowadays -1920-, the brand new Volap\u00fck has been forgotten definitively. We forecast the same for Esperanto.\"\nLarge Volap\u00fck collections are held by the International Esperanto Museum in Vienna, Austria; the Center for Documentation and Study about the International Language in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland; and the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\nIn 2000 there were an estimated 20 Volap\u00fck speakers in the world.\nIn December 2007 it was reported that the Volap\u00fck version of Wikipedia had recently jumped to 15th place among language editions, with more than 112,000 articles.\nA few months earlier there had been only 797 articles. The massive increase in the size of \"V\u00fckiped\", bringing it ahead of the Esperanto Wikipedia, was due to an enthusiast who had used a computer program to automatically create geographical articles, many on small villages. The motive was to gain visibility for the language.\nBy March 2013 the Esperanto Wikipedia, with a very active user community, had risen to 176,792 articles, while the Volap\u00fck Wikipedia had at that point 119,091 articles.\nThere has been a continuous Volap\u00fck speaker community since Schleyer's time, with an unbroken succession of \"Cifals\" (leaders). These were:\nOrthography and phonology.\nThe phonology of Volap\u00fck is as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAdditionally, \u27e8x\u27e9 represents the sequence //. The letters C, J, S and Z are pronounced voiced after voiced consonants and unvoiced otherwise.\nThere are no diphthongs; each vowel letter is pronounced separately.\nThe letters \"\u00e4\", \"\u00f6\", and \"\u00fc\" do not have alternative forms such as the \"ae\", \"oe\", and \"ue\" of German, but Schleyer proposed alternate forms \"\ua79b\", \"\ua79d\", and \"\ua79f\" for them, all of which are part of Unicode since version 7.0 released in June 2014:\nSpecial consonantal letters.\nThe following letters were constructed by the inventor to designate sounds which occasionally occur:\nLetter \"r\".\nModern Volap\u00fck has minimal \"l\u2013r\" pairs such as \"religion\" versus \"iron\".\nStress.\nPolysyllabic words are always stressed on the final vowel; for example, \"never\" is pronounced . Exceptionally, the question clitic \"-li\" does not shift the stress of the word it attaches to. When words are compounded together, secondary stress is retained on the final syllables of the compounded elements, as long as that does not result in adjacent stressed syllables.\nVocabulary.\nSchleyer adapted the vocabulary mostly from English, with a smattering of German and French. Some words remain readily recognizable for a speaker of one of the source languages, but many others are modified beyond easy recognition. For instance, \"vol\" and \"p\u00fck\" are derived from the English words \"world\" and \"speak\". Although unimportant linguistically, and regardless of the simplicity and consistency of the stress rule, these deformations were greatly mocked by the language's detractors. It seems to have been Schleyer's intention, however, to alter its loan words in such a way that they would be hard to recognise, thus losing their ties to the languages (and, by extension, nations) from which they came. Conversely, Esperanto and Interlingua are commonly criticized as being much easier to learn for Europeans than for those with non-European native languages.\nGrammar.\nThe grammar is based on that of typical European languages, but with an agglutinative character: grammatical inflections are indicated by stringing together separate affixes for each element of meaning.\nNouns.\nNouns inflect for case and number, but not for gender.\nThe following is the declension of the Volap\u00fck word \"world\":\nAs in German, the Volap\u00fck noun has four cases: nominative, genitive, dative and accusative. In compound words, the first part of the compound is usually separated from the second by the genitive termination \"-a\", e.g.\u00a0\"Vola-p\u00fck\", \"of-world language\": \"language of the world\". However, the other case endings (\"-e\" dative, \"-i\" accusative) are sometimes used if applicable, or the roots may be agglutinated in the nominative, with no separating vowel.\nAdjectives and adverbs.\nAdjectives, formed by the suffix \"-ik\", normally follow the noun they qualify. They do not agree with the noun in number and case in that position, but they do if they precede the noun, are separated from it by intervening words, or stand alone. Adverbs are formed by suffixing \"-o\", either to the root or to the adjectival \"-ik\" ( \"good\", \"well\"); they normally follow the verb or adjective they modify.\nPronouns.\nThe pronouns begin with \"o-.\" In the singular, they are \"I\", \"thou\", \"he/it\", \"she\", (impersonal), \"one\", \"oneself\". They are pluralized with \"-s\": \"we\", \"ye\", \"they\". The possessive may be formed with either the genitive \"-a\" or with adjectival \"-ik\": or \"my\". Prepositions, conjunctions and interjections are also formed from noun roots by appending appropriate suffixes. In later, reformed Volap\u00fck, was narrowed down to males only, whereas got the meaning of 'it' as well as impersonal 'they'.\nVerbs.\nThe verb carries a fine degree of detail, with morphemes marking tense, aspect, voice, person, number and (in the third person) the subject's gender. However, many of these categories are optional, and a verb can stand in an unmarked state. A Volap\u00fck verb can be conjugated in 1,584 ways (including infinitives and reflexives).\nFor the simple present, the pronouns are suffixed to the verb stem:\n\"binob\" I am, \"binol\" thou art,\netc. The present passive takes the prefix \"pa-\":\n\"pal\u00f6fons\" they are loved.\nThe three tenses in the indicative, and the three perfect aspects, each take a characteristic vowel prefix:\nThe present-tense prefix is omitted in the active voice, so:\n\"binob\" I am, \"\u00e4binol\" you were, \"ebinom\" he has been, \"ibinof\" she had been, \"obinos\" it will be, \"ubinon\" one will have been.\nThese are seen as being more distant from the present tense the further the vowel is from in vowel space, and they can be used with temporal words to indicate distance in the past or future. For example, from \"del\" 'day',\n\"adelo\" today, \"odelo\" tomorrow, \"udelo\" the day after tomorrow, \"\u00e4delo\" yesterday, \"edelo\" the day before yesterday, \"idelo\" three days ago.\nThe passive voice is formed with \"p-\", and here the \"a\" is required for the present tense:\n\"pal\u00f6fob\" I am loved, \"p\u00e4logol\" you were seen, \"pologobs\" we will be seen.\nThe infinitive is formed with the suffix \"-\u00f6n\". It can be combined with tense/aspect prefixes:\n\"Log\u00f6n\" to see, \"elog\u00f6n\" to have seen.\nYes\u2013no questions are indicated with the particle \"li\":\n\"P\u00e4logom-li\" was he seen?\nThe hyphen indicates that the syllable \"li\" does not take stress. It occurs before the verb to avoid a sequence of three consonants or a double el: \"li-p\u00e4logol? li-binoms?\"\nParticiples, both active and passive, are formed with \"-\u00f6l\":\n\"Log\u00f6l\" seeing, \"elog\u00f6l\" having seen, \"olog\u00f6l\" being about to see, \"palog\u00f6l\" seen (being seen), \"pelog\u00f6l\" seen (having been seen), \"polog\u00f6l\" about to be seen.\n\"Binob pen\u00f6l\" is literally 'I am writing', though \"penob\" is also used. For \"I write\" as habitual action, the habitual aspect is used. This is formed by adding \"-i-\" after the tense prefix, and here again the present-tense \"a-\" is required. The forms are thus active \"ai-, \u00e4i-, ei-, ii-, oi-, ui-,\" passive \"pai-, p\u00e4i-, pei-, pii-, poi-, pui-.\" All are pronounced as two syllables.\n\"Aifidob bodi\" I eat bread (as a daily occurrence), \"\u00e4ipenob penedis\" I used to write letters.\nWith temporal words,\n\"aidelo\" daily (at the present time)\nThe imperative \"-\u00f6d\" follows the subject suffix:\n\"Golol\u00f6d!\" Go! (to one person), \"golols\u00f6d!\" go! (to more than one person)\nOptative \"-\u00f6s\" is used for courteous requests, and jussive \"-\u00f6z\" an emphatic command.\nConditionals are formed with \"-la\" for the protasis (\"if\"-clause) and \"-\u00f6v\" for the apodosis (\"then\"-clause):\n \"If \u00e4binob-la liegik, \u00e4binob\u00f6v givik\"\u00a0\u2013 if I were rich I would be generous.\n \"Ibinom\u00f6v givik, if ibinom-la liegik\"\u00a0\u2013 he would have been generous if he had been rich.\nNote that the tense changes as well, so that in the first example the past tense is used even though the present tense is intended. Like the question particle, the \"-la\" is written with a hyphen to indicate that it is not stressed in speech.\nA potential mood is formed with \"-\u00f6x\":\n\"Pelom\u00f6x\" he might pay.\nReflexive forms are made from the active voice and the pronoun \"ok\":\n\"Vat\u00fckob\" I wash, \"vat\u00fckobok\" (or \"vat\u00fckob obi\") I wash myself.\nIn the third person, the periphrastic form of \"vat\u00fckomok\" (he washes himself) must use the reflexive pronoun, \"vat\u00fckom oki\", as \"vat\u00fckom omi\" would mean \"he washes him (someone else)\".\nThe plural \"-s\" may precede or follow the reflexive, as the speaker chooses:\n\"vat\u00fckomoks\" or \"vat\u00fckomsok\" they wash themselves.\nHere there is a meaningful distinction between joining the pronoun to the verb, and inflecting it independently:\n\"L\u00f6fobsok\" we love ourselves, \"l\u00f6fobs obis\" we love each other.\nThe gerundive arguments are active \"\u00f6-\", passive \"p\u00f6-\".\nUsage as common noun.\nThe word \"Volap\u00fck\" or a variation thereof means \"nonsense, gibberish\" in certain languages, such as Danish \"volapyk\" and Esperanto \"volapuka\u0135o\".\nIn Russian, the term \"Volapuk encoding\" refers to writing Cyrillic letters with the Latin alphabet based on what they look like, for example writing \"BOJTATTI-OK\" instead of \u0432\u043e\u043b\u0430\u043f\u044e\u043a.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Mined only in the kingdom of Wakanda, the metal is associated with the character Black Panther, who wears a suit of vibranium, and Captain America, who bears a vibranium/steel alloy shield. An alternate form of the material, known as Antarctic Vibranium, or Anti-Metal, has appeared in the Savage Land.\nPublication history.\nVibranium first appeared in \"Daredevil\" #13 (February 1966), which was written by Stan Lee and layouts by Jack Kirby with finished art by John Romita. Here, vibranium was seen to be an unusual metallic element with decidedly strange properties. Since that point in Marvel Comics continuity, it has been established that there are a few variations of this element which can be found in isolated regions all around the world. The variation first introduced in \"Daredevil\" #13 eventually became known as Anti-Metal. This variation is different in that it can cut through any known metal. In the Marvel Universe, Anti-Metal can traditionally be found only in Antarctica. Later in \"Fantastic Four\" #53 (August 1966), by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, a new variation of vibranium was introduced in the isolated nation of Wakanda. This variation had the unique attribute of being able to absorb sound. This is the variation which is most often identified in continuity as simply \"vibranium\".\nFictional history.\nIn the Marvel Universe, vibranium was first deposited on Earth by a meteorite 10,000 years ago. It was discovered during an expedition to Antarctica and named \"Anti-Metal\" due to its property of dissolving other metals.\nA different variety of vibranium found in Wakanda absorbs sound waves and other vibrations, including kinetic energy. Absorbing sound waves, vibrations, and kinetic energy makes this metal stronger. To protect this resource, Wakandans concealed their country from the outside world. Wakandan king T'Chaka funded his country's education by occasionally selling off minuscule quantities of the metal. As a result, Wakanda is one of the world's most technologically advanced nations.\nDuring the early 1940s, a small amount of Wakandan vibranium came into the possession of the scientist Myron MacLain. He tried to combine vibranium with iron to create armor, but was unable to fuse the elements. One morning, MacLain found that the two materials had bonded on their own in an unknown manner. The ultra-resilient alloy was used to create Captain America's shield. MacLain worked for decades without success to duplicate the accident, creating adamantium in the process.\nWhen T'Challa became the king of Wakanda, he strove to end his country's isolation from the rest of the world. Making the existence of vibranium known to the outside world around the mid-1980s, he sold small quantities of it to foreigners who, he believed, would not use it to harmful ends. T'Challa used the profits to enrich and modernize his nation.\nProperties and known abilities.\nWakandan variety.\nWakandan Vibranium is the most common variety, and can absorb vibrations and kinetic energy directed at it. Wakandan vibranium is also a powerful mutagen. Its radiation permeates much of Wakanda's flora and fauna, including the Heart-Shaped Herb eaten by members of the Black Panther Tribe and the flesh of the white gorilla eaten by the members of the White Gorilla Tribe. Both give superhuman abilities to whoever eats them.\nAntarctic variety.\nBetter known as Anti-Metal, this isotope is native to the Savage Land. The variation produces vibrations of a specific wavelength that break down molecular bonds in metals, causing them to liquefy. It was first discovered by explorer Robert Plunder, the father of Kevin and Parnival Plunder. Wakandan vibranium can be transformed into Antarctic vibranium through exposure to certain kinds of radiation.\nMuch like Wakandan vibranium, Antarctic vibranium can cause mutations. One person who donned an Anti-Metal suit for protection against Moon Knight began emitting the same radiation he had intended to weaponize.\nArtificial variety.\nThere are at least two forms of man-made vibranium created outside of Wakanda through various means. The first variant is called NuForm, which was created by the Roxxon Corporation. It possesses the properties of Wakandan vibranium, but degrades into Antarctic vibranium unless tempered with microwave radiation.\nThe second is Reverbium, a dangerous artificial brand created at Horizon Labs by Sajani Jaffrey. Unlike standard vibranium, it rapidly amplifies sound energy before exploding.\nLiving variety.\nWakandan scientist Obinna Nwabueze discovered a new form of vibranium in the Echo Chamber, a cave used for training by the Dora Milaje. This variety of Vibranium possesses limited sentience and can attune itself to the environment to cause a variety of effects.\nIn other media.\nMarvel Cinematic Universe.\nVibranium (also known as Isipho) appears in live-action films set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. First appearing and named on-screen in \"\", Howard Stark states the element is stronger than steel, weighs one third as much, and is completely Vibration-absorbent. Having acquired enough to make a shield, Steve Rogers uses it when he becomes Captain America.\nVideo games.\nVibranium appears in \"\". A nanite-based artificial intelligence known as \"the Fold\" attempts to harvest vibranium in Wakanda to construct communication towers around the world, spreading its control signal globally. While the heroes manage to thwart the invasion, they are unable to prevent the Fold from constructing enough towers to make it a global threat.\nMusic.\nVibranium is referenced in the 2019 single \"Take Me Back to London\" by Ed Sheeran (featuring Stormzy).\nIt is also referenced in the bridge of the 2020 track \"Love Is a War\" by Jeremy Renner.\nReal-world material.\nIn 2016, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies developed a real-world smart composite material that they named Vibranium. The lightweight carbon fiber material for the Hyperloop pods is reported to provide the passengers double protection against damage to the exterior. The company says that its Vibranium is 8 times lighter than aluminum and 10 times stronger than steel alternatives. The smart material can transmit critical information regarding temperature, stability, integrity and more, wirelessly and virtually instantly.\nJournalists have drawn parallels between Wakanda's vibranium reserves and the mining of coltan in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Coltan is an ore containing niobium and tantalum, two rare and valuable metals, and its exploitation is linked with child-labor, systematic exploitation of the population by governments or militant groups, exposure to toxic chemicals and other hazards; see coltan mining and ethics. Historian Thomas F. McDow draws a parallel to uranium, found in the mine Shinkolobwe in Haut-Katanga Province, also in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nScholarly analysis.\nThe concept of vibranium as an extremely valuable material, monopolized and mastered by the African civilization of Wakanda, has been subject to scholarly analysis. Several studies have looked at it from the perspective of cultural studies and literary criticism, including tying it to the genre of afrofuturism. Alessio Gerola noted in the context of the 2018 film \"Black Panther\", that \"Fundamental disagreements about vibranium\u2019s existence and use drive the film\u2019s plot, but the mythology and history of vibranium are even more essential to understanding how and why characters like Klaw, Killmonger, T'Challa, and Shuri treat vibranium the way they do\", concluding that \"Vibranium, from a narrative point of view, simply represents the power of possibilities and the disagreements that arise about the \u201cgreat responsibilities\u201d that follow from such \u201cgreat powers\u201d.\nIt has been also analyzed with regards to its physical properties as a type of supermaterial. In 2017, Mark Whiting concluded that vibranium, as described in fiction, is not unrealistic, and resembles \"a high-entropy shape-memory alloy composite, reinforced with a ceramic\", beyond the ability of our current material science to produce, but not beyond the ability of our current theoretical science to explain. It has been suggested that the popular culture impact of vibranium can make it useful as a teaching-aid when attempting to interest students in material science and related fields.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is designed to combine the functionality of a conventional helicopter with the long-range, high-speed cruise performance of a turboprop aircraft. The V-22 is operated by the United States and Japan, and is not only a new aircraft design, but a new type of aircraft that entered service in the 2000s, a tiltrotor compared to fixed wing and helicopter designs. The V-22 first flew in 1989 and after a long development was fielded in 2007. The design combines the vertical takeoff ability of a helicopter with the speed and range of a fixed-wing airplane.\nThe failure of Operation Eagle Claw in 1980 during the Iran hostage crisis underscored that there were military roles for which neither conventional helicopters nor fixed-wing transport aircraft were well-suited. The United States Department of Defense (DoD) initiated a program to develop an innovative transport aircraft with long-range, high-speed, and vertical-takeoff capabilities, and the Joint-service Vertical take-off/landing Experimental (JVX) program officially began in 1981. A partnership between Bell Helicopter and Boeing Helicopters was awarded a development contract in 1983 for the V-22 tiltrotor aircraft. The Bell-Boeing team jointly produces the aircraft. The V-22 first flew in 1989 and began flight testing and design alterations; the complexity and difficulties of being the first tiltrotor for military service led to many years of development.\nThe United States Marine Corps (USMC) began crew training for the MV-22B Osprey in 2000 and fielded it in 2007; it supplemented and then replaced their Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knights. The U.S. Air Force (USAF) fielded its version of the tiltrotor, the CV-22B, in 2009. Since entering service with the Marine Corps and Air Force, the Osprey has been deployed in transportation and medevac operations over Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and Kuwait. The U.S. Navy began using the CMV-22B for carrier onboard delivery duties in 2021.\nDevelopment.\nOrigins.\nThe failure of Operation Eagle Claw, the Iran hostage rescue mission, in 1980 demonstrated to the U.S. military a need for \"a new type of aircraft, that could not only take off and land vertically but also could carry combat troops, and do so at speed.\" Additionally, a concentrated force is vulnerable to a single nuclear weapon. Airborne solutions with high speed and range allow for their rapid dispersal to reduce this vulnerability. The U.S. Department of Defense began the JVX aircraft program in 1981, under U.S.\u00a0Army leadership.\nThe established tactical purpose of the USMC is to perform an amphibious landing, which the JVX program promised to facilitate. The USMC's primary helicopter model, the CH-46 Sea Knight, was aging, and no replacement had been accepted. Because the USMC's amphibious capability would be significantly reduced without the CH-46, USMC leadership believed a proposal to merge the Marine Corps with the Army was a credible threat. This potential merger was akin to a proposal by President Truman following World War II. The Office of the Secretary of Defense and Navy administration opposed the tiltrotor project, but pressure from Congress had a significant effect on the program's development.\nThe Navy and USMC were given the lead in 1983. The JVX combined requirements from the USMC, USAF, Army and Navy. A request for preliminary design proposals was issued in December 1982. Interest was expressed by A\u00e9rospatiale, Bell Helicopter, Boeing Vertol, Grumman, Lockheed, and Westland. Contractors were encouraged to form teams. Bell partnered with Boeing Vertol to submit a proposal for an enlarged version of the Bell XV-15 prototype on 17 February 1983. Since this was the only proposal the JVX program received, a preliminary design contract was awarded on 26 April 1983.\nThe JVX aircraft was designated \"V-22 Osprey\" on 15 January 1985; by that March, the first six prototypes were being produced, and Boeing Vertol was expanded to handle the workload. Production work is split between Bell and Boeing. Bell Helicopter manufactures and integrates the wing, nacelles, rotors, drive system, tail surfaces, and aft ramp, as well as integrating the Rolls-Royce engines and performing final assembly. Boeing Helicopters manufactures and integrates the fuselage, cockpit, avionics, and flight controls. The USMC variant received the MV-22 designation, and the USAF variant received CV-22; this was reversed from normal procedure to prevent USMC Ospreys from having a conflicting CV designation with aircraft carriers. Full-scale development began in 1986. On 3 May 1986, Bell Boeing was awarded a US$1.714\u00a0billion contract for the V-22 by the U.S. Navy. At this point, all four U.S. military services had acquisition plans for the V-22.\nThe first V-22 was publicly rolled out in May 1988. That year, the U.S. Army left the program, citing a need to focus its budget on more immediate aviation programs. In 1989, the V-22 survived two separate Senate votes that could have resulted in cancellation. Despite the Senate's decision, the Department of Defense instructed the Navy not to spend more money on the V-22. As development cost projections greatly increased in 1988, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney tried to defund it from 1989 to 1992, but was overruled by Congress, which provided unrequested program funding. Multiple studies of alternatives found the V-22 provided more capability and effectiveness with similar operating costs. The Clinton Administration was supportive of the V-22, helping it attain funding.\nAlthough the Army departed the program, it eventually developed and chose a tiltrotor to replace the UH-60 Blackhawk in the 21st century, and as of the mid-2020s the Army is planning to field the V-280 Valor tiltrotor.\nFlight testing and design changes.\nThe first of six prototypes first flew on 19 March 1989 in the helicopter mode and on 14 September 1989 in fixed-wing mode. The third and fourth prototypes successfully completed the first sea trials on in December 1990. The fourth and fifth prototypes crashed in 1991\u201392. From October 1992 to April 1993, the V-22 was redesigned to reduce empty weight, simplify manufacture, and reduce build costs; it was designated V-22B. Flights resumed in June 1993 after safety changes were made to the prototypes. Bell Boeing received a contract for the engineering manufacturing development (EMD) phase in June 1994. The prototypes were also modified to resemble the V-22B standard. At this stage, testing focused on flight envelope expansion, measuring flight loads, and supporting the EMD redesign. Flight testing with the early V-22s continued into 1997.\nFlight testing of four full-scale development V-22s began at the Naval Air Warfare Test Center, Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland. The first EMD flight took place on 5 February 1997. Testing soon fell behind schedule. The first of four low rate initial production aircraft, ordered on 28 April 1997, was delivered on 27 May 1999. The second sea trials were completed onboard in January 1999. During external load testing in April 1999, a V-22 transported the lightweight M777 howitzer.\nIn 2000, there were two fatal crashes, killing a total of 23 marines, and the V-22 was again grounded while the crashes' causes were investigated and various parts were redesigned. In June 2005, the V-22 completed its final operational evaluation, including long-range deployments, high altitude, desert and shipboard operations; problems previously identified had reportedly been resolved.\nU.S. Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) worked on software upgrades to increase the maximum speed from , increase helicopter mode altitude limit from or , and increase lift performance. By 2012, changes had been made to the hardware, software, and procedures in response to hydraulic fires in the nacelles, vortex ring state control issues, and opposed landings; reliability has improved accordingly.\nAn MV-22 landed and refueled on board in an evaluation in October 2012. In 2013, cargo handling trials occurred on . In October 2015, NAVAIR tested rolling landings and takeoffs on a carrier, preparing for carrier onboard delivery.\nDiscussions.\nDevelopment was protracted and controversial, partly because of large cost increases, some of which were caused by a requirement to fold wings and rotors to fit aboard ships. The development budget was first set at US$2.5\u00a0billion in 1986, increasing to a projected US$30\u00a0billion in 1988. By 2008, US$27\u00a0billion had been spent and another US$27.2\u00a0billion was required for planned production numbers. Between 2008 and 2011, the V-22's estimated lifetime cost grew by 61%, mostly for maintenance and support.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Its [The V-22's] production costs are considerably greater than for helicopters with equivalent capability\u00a0\u2013 specifically, about twice as great as for the CH-53E, which has a greater payload and an ability to carry heavy equipment the V-22 cannot\u00a0... an Osprey unit would cost around $60\u00a0million to produce, and $35\u00a0million for the helicopter equivalent.\u2014\u200a\nIn 2001, Lieutenant Colonel Odin Leberman, commander of the V-22 squadron at Marine Corps Air Station New River, was relieved of duty after allegations that he instructed his unit to falsify maintenance records to make it appear more reliable. Three officers were implicated for their roles in the falsification scandal.\nIn October 2007, a \"Time\" magazine article condemned the V-22 as unsafe, overpriced, and inadequate; the USMC responded that the article's data was partly obsolete, inaccurate, and held high expectations for any new field of aircraft. In 2011, the controversial defense industry-supported Lexington Institute reported that the average mishap rate per flight hour over the past 10 years was the lowest of any USMC rotorcraft, approximately half of the average fleet accident rate. In 2011, \"Wired\" magazine reported that the safety record had excluded ground incidents; the USMC responded that MV-22 reporting used the same standards as other Navy aircraft.\nBy 2012, the USMC reported fleetwide readiness rate had risen to 68%; however, the DOD's Inspector General later found 167 of 200 reports had \"improperly recorded\" information. Captain Richard Ulsh blamed errors on incompetence, saying that they were \"not malicious\" or deliberate. The required mission capable rate was 82%, but the average was 53% from June 2007 to May 2010. In 2010, Naval Air Systems Command aimed for an 85% reliability rate by 2018. From 2009 to 2014, readiness rates rose 25% to the \"high 80s\", while cost per flight hour had dropped 20% to $9,520 through a rigorous maintenance improvement program that focused on diagnosing problems before failures occur. As of 2015[ [update]], although the V-22 requires more maintenance and has lower availability (62%) than traditional helicopters, it also has a lower mishap rate. The average cost per flight hour is US$, whereas the Sikorsky CH-53E Super Stallion cost about $20,000 (~$ in 2024) per flight hour in 2007. V-22 ownership cost was $83,000 per hour in 2013. In 2022, the Pentagon evaluated its cost per flight hour at $23,941.\nWhile technically capable of autorotation if both engines fail in helicopter mode, a safe landing is difficult. In 2005, a director of the Pentagon's testing office stated that in a loss of power while hovering below , emergency landings \"are not likely to be survivable.\" V-22 pilot Captain Justin \"Moon\" McKinney stated that: \"We can turn it into a plane and glide it down, just like a C-130.\" A complete loss of power requires both engines to fail, as one engine can power both proprotors via interconnected drive shafts. Though vortex ring state (VRS) contributed to a deadly V-22 accident, flight testing found it to be less susceptible to VRS than conventional helicopters. A GAO report stated that the V-22 is \"less forgiving than conventional helicopters\" during VRS. Several test flights to explore VRS characteristics were canceled. The USMC trains pilots in the recognition of and recovery from VRS, and has instituted operational envelope limits and instrumentation to help avoid VRS conditions.\nProduction.\nOn 28 September 2005, the Pentagon formally approved full-rate production, increasing from 11 V-22s per year to between 24 and 48 per year by 2012. Of the 458 total planned, 360 are for the USMC, 50 for the USAF, and 48 for the Navy at an average cost of $110\u00a0million per aircraft, including development costs. The V-22 had an incremental flyaway cost of $67\u00a0million per aircraft in 2008, The Navy had hoped to shave about $10\u00a0million off that cost via a five-year production contract in 2013. Each CV-22 cost $73\u00a0million (~$ in 2024) in the FY 2014 budget.\nOn 15 April 2010, the Naval Air Systems Command awarded Bell Boeing a $42.1\u00a0million (~$ in 2024) contract to design an integrated processor in response to avionics obsolescence and add new network capabilities. By 2014, Raytheon began providing an avionics upgrade that includes situational awareness and blue force tracking. In 2009, a contract for Block C upgrades was awarded to Bell Boeing. In February 2012, the USMC received the first V-22C, featuring a new radar, additional mission management and electronic warfare equipment. In 2015, options for upgrading all aircraft to the V-22C standard were examined.\nOn 12 June 2013, the U.S. DoD awarded a $4.9\u00a0billion contract for 99 V-22s in production Lots 17 and 18, including 92 MV-22s for the USMC, for completion in September 2019. A provision gives NAVAIR the option to order 23 more Ospreys. As of June 2013, the combined value of all contracts placed totaled $6.5\u00a0billion. In 2013, Bell laid off production staff following the US's order being cut to about half of the planned number. Production rate went from 40 in 2012 to 22 planned for 2015. Manufacturing robots have replaced older automated machines for increased accuracy and efficiency; large parts are held in place by suction cups and measured electronically.\nIn March 2014, Air Force Special Operations Command issued a Combat Mission Need Statement for armor to protect V-22 passengers. NAVAIR worked with a Florida-based composite armor company and the Army Aviation Development Directorate to develop and deliver the advanced ballistic stopping system (ABSS) by October 2014. Costing $270,000, the ABSS consists of 66 plates fitting along interior bulkheads and deck, adding to the aircraft's weight, affecting payload and range. The ABSS can be installed or removed when needed in hours and partially assembled in pieces for partial protection of specific areas. As of May 2015, 16 kits had been delivered to the USAF.\nIn 2015, Bell Boeing set up the V-22 Readiness Operations Center at Ridley Park, Pennsylvania, to gather information from each aircraft to improve fleet performance in a similar manner as the F-35's Autonomic Logistics Information System.\nTwo programs, the \"V-22 Cockpit Technology Replacement\" (VeCToR) and \"Renewed V-22 Aircraft Modernization Program\" (ReVAMP), are being studied to upgrade the aircraft and extend its life. VeCToR would upgrade the cockpit with more modern electronics in the 2030s and 40s, and ReVAMP would be a fuselage life extension program to extend the V-22's service beyond the 2060s.\nDesign.\nOverview.\nThe Osprey is the world's first production tiltrotor aircraft, with one three-bladed proprotor, turboshaft engine, and transmission nacelle mounted on each wingtip. It is classified as a powered lift aircraft by the Federal Aviation Administration. For takeoff and landing, it typically operates as a helicopter with the nacelles vertical and rotors horizontal. Once airborne, the nacelles rotate forward 90\u00b0 in as little as 12 seconds for horizontal flight, converting the V-22 to a more fuel-efficient, higher-speed aircraft, like a turboprop aircraft. STOL rolling-takeoff and landing capability is achieved by having the nacelles tilted forward up to 45\u00b0. Other orientations are possible. Pilots describe the V-22 in airplane mode as comparable to the C-130 in feel and speed. It has a ferry range of over 2,100 nmi. Its operational range is 1,100 nmi.\nComposite materials make up 43% of the airframe, and the proprotor blades also use composites. For storage, the V-22's rotors fold in 90 seconds and its wing rotates to align, front-to-back, with the fuselage. Because of the requirement for folding rotors, their diameter is less than would be optimal for an aircraft of this size to conduct vertical takeoff, resulting in high disk loading. Most missions use fixed wing flight 75% or more of the time, reducing wear and tear and operational costs. This fixed wing flight is higher than typical helicopter missions allowing longer range line-of-sight communications for improved command and control.\nExhaust heat from the V-22's engines can potentially damage ships' flight decks and coatings. NAVAIR devised a temporary fix of portable heat shields placed under the engines and determined that a long-term solution would require redesigning decks with heat resistant coating, passive thermal barriers, and ship structure changes. Similar changes are required for F-35B operations. In 2009, DARPA requested solutions for installing robust flight deck cooling. A heat-resistant anti-skid metal spray named Thermion has been tested on USS \"Wasp\".\nPropulsion.\nThe V-22's two Rolls-Royce AE 1107C engines are connected by drive shafts to a common central gearbox so that one engine can power both proprotors if an engine failure occurs. Either engine can power both proprotors through the wing driveshaft. However, the V-22 is generally not capable of hovering on one engine. If a proprotor gearbox fails, that proprotor cannot be feathered, and both engines must be stopped before an emergency landing. The autorotation characteristics are poor because of the rotors' low inertia. The AE 1107C engine has a two-shaft axial design with a 14-stage compressor, an effusion-cooled annular combustor, a two-stage gas generator turbine, and two-stage power turbine.\nIn September 2013, Rolls-Royce announced that it had increased the AE-1107C engine's power by 17% via the adoption of a new Block 3 turbine, increased fuel valve flow capacity, and software updates; it should also improve reliability in high-altitude, high-heat conditions and boost maximum payload limitations from . A Block 4 upgrade is reportedly being examined, which may increase power by up to 26%, producing close to , and improve fuel consumption.\nIn August 2014, the U.S. military issued a request for information for a potential drop-in replacement for the AE-1107C engines. Submissions must have a power rating of no less than at 15,000\u00a0rpm, operate at up to at up to , and fit into the existing wing nacelles with minimal structural or external modifications. In September 2014, the U.S. Navy, who already purchase engines separately to airframes, was reportedly considering an alternative engine supplier to reduce costs. The General Electric GE38 is one option, giving commonality with the Sikorsky CH-53K King Stallion.\nThe V-22 has a maximum rotor downwash speed of over , more than the lower limit of a hurricane. The rotorwash usually prevents the starboard door's usage in hover; the rear ramp is used for rappelling and hoisting instead. The V-22 loses 10% of its vertical lift over a tiltwing design when operating in helicopter mode because of the wings' airflow resistance, while the tiltrotor design has better short takeoff and landing performance. V-22s must keep at least of vertical separation between each other to avoid each other's rotor wake, which causes turbulence and potentially control loss. The extreme rotor downwash of the V-22 has caused incidents when rappelling or fast roping from the aircraft, including a soldier being blown 3 meters away from his intended dismount point by the force of the downwash. The downwash is strong enough to destroy unstrengthened helipads and can create flying debris in the landing zone that can injure bystanders or potentially damage the aircraft; an incident involving a Marine Corps Osprey in 2010 resulted in 10 bystanders suffering downwash-related injuries.\nAvionics.\nThe V-22 is equipped with a glass cockpit, which incorporates four multi-function displays (MFDs, compatible with night-vision goggles) and one shared central display unit, to display various images including: digimaps, imagery from the Turreted forward-looking infrared system primary flight instruments, navigation (TACAN, VOR, ILS, GPS, INS), and system status. The flight director panel of the cockpit management system allows for fully coupled (autopilot) functions that take the aircraft from forward flight into a hover with no pilot interaction other than programming the system. The fuselage is not pressurized, and personnel must wear on-board oxygen masks above 10,000 feet.\nThe V-22 has triple-redundant fly-by-wire flight control systems; these have computerized damage control to automatically isolate damaged areas. With the nacelles pointing straight up in conversion mode at 90\u00b0 the flight computers command it to fly like a helicopter, cyclic forces being applied to a conventional swashplate at the rotor hub. With the nacelles in airplane mode (0\u00b0) the flaperons, rudder, and elevator fly similar to an airplane. This is a gradual transition, occurring over the nacelles' rotation range; the lower the nacelles, the greater effect of the airplane-mode control surfaces. The nacelles can rotate past vertical to 97.5\u00b0 for rearward flight. The V-22 can use the \"80 Jump\" orientation with the nacelles at 80\u00b0 for takeoff to quickly achieve high altitude and speed. The controls automate to the extent that it can hover in low wind without hands on the controls.\nNew USMC V-22 pilots learn to fly helicopter and multiengine fixed-wing aircraft before the tiltrotor. Some V-22 pilots believe that former fixed-wing pilots may be preferable over helicopter users, as they are not trained to constantly adjust the controls in hover. Others say that experience with helicopters' hovering and precision is most important. As of \u00a02021[ [update]] the US military does not track whether fixed-wing or helicopter pilots transition more easily to the V-22, according to USMC Colonel Matthew Kelly, V-22 project manager. He said that fixed-wing pilots are more experienced at instrument flying, while helicopter pilots are more experienced at scanning outside when the aircraft is moving slowly.\nArmament.\nThe V-22 can be armed with one 7.62\u00d751mm NATO (.308\u00a0in caliber) M240 machine gun or .50 in caliber (12.7\u00a0mm) M2 machine gun on the rear loading ramp. A 12.7\u00a0mm (.50\u00a0in) GAU-19 three-barrel Gatling gun mounted below the nose was studied. BAE Systems developed a belly-mounted, remotely operated gun turret system, the Interim Defense Weapon System (IDWS); it is remotely operated by a gunner, targets are acquired via a separate pod using color television and forward looking infrared imagery. The IDWS was installed on half of the V-22s deployed to Afghanistan in 2009; it found limited use because of its weight and restrictive rules of engagement.\nThere were 32 IDWSs available to the USMC in June 2012; V-22s often flew without it as the added weight reduced cargo capacity. The V-22's speed allows it to outrun conventional support helicopters, thus a self-defense capability was required on long-range independent operations. The infrared gun camera proved useful for reconnaissance and surveillance. Other weapons were studied to provide all-quadrant fire, including nose guns, door guns, and non-lethal countermeasures to work with the current ramp-mounted machine gun and the IDWS.\nIn 2014, the USMC studied new weapons with \"all-axis, stand-off, and precision capabilities\", akin to the AGM-114 Hellfire, AGM-176 Griffin, Joint Air-to-Ground Missile, and GBU-53/B SDB II. In November 2014, Bell Boeing conducted self-funded weapons tests, equipping a V-22 with a pylon on the front fuselage and replacing the AN/AAQ-27A EO camera with an L-3 Wescam MX-15 sensor/laser designator. 26 unguided Hydra 70 rockets, two guided APKWS rockets, and two Griffin B missiles were fired over five flights. The USMC and USAF sought a traversable nose-mounted weapon connected to a helmet-mounted sight; recoil complicated integrating a forward-facing gun. A pylon could carry of munitions. However, by 2019, the USMC opted for IDWS upgrades over adopting new weapons.\nRefueling capability.\nBoeing is developing a roll-on/roll-off aerial refueling kit, which would give the V-22 the ability to refuel other aircraft. Having an aerial refueling capability that can be based on Wasp-class amphibious assault ships would increase the F-35B's strike power, removing reliance on refueling assets solely based on large \"Nimitz\"-class aircraft carriers or land bases. The roll-on/roll-off kit can also be applicable to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) functions. Boeing funded a non-functional demonstration on a VMX-22 aircraft; a prototype kit was successfully tested with an F/A-18 on 5 September 2013.\nThe high-speed version of the hose/drogue refueling system can be deployed at and function at up to . A mix of tanks and a roll-on/roll-off bladder house up to of fuel. The ramp must open to extend the hose, then raised once extended. It can refuel rotorcraft, needing a separate drogue used specifically by helicopters and a converted nacelle. Many USMC ground vehicles can run on aviation fuel; a refueling V-22 could service these. In late 2014, it was stated that V-22 tankers could be in use by 2017, but contract delays pushed IOC to late 2019. As part of a 26 May 2016 contract award to Boeing, Cobham was contracted to adapt their FR-300 hose drum unit as used by the KC-130 in October 2016. In May 2025, the Navy confirmed that V-22s were not training for aerial refueling missions, and that neither NAVAIR nor the V-22 program office intends to pursue such a capability as there was no interest from the fleet.\nOperational history.\nIn October 2019, the fleet of 375 V-22s operated by the U.S. Armed Forces surpassed the 500,000 flight hour mark. A fatal accident in December 2023, led the fleet being grounded until March 2024 by the US and Japan.\nU.S. Marine Corps.\nSince March 2000, VMMT-204 has conducted training for the type. In December 2005, Lieutenant General James Amos, commander of II Marine Expeditionary Force, accepted delivery of the first batch of MV-22s. The unit reactivated in March 2006 as the first MV-22 squadron, redesignated as VMM-263. In 2007, HMM-266 became Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 266 (VMM-266) and reached initial operational capability. The MV-22 started replacing the CH-46 Sea Knight in 2007; the CH-46 was retired in October 2014. On 13 April 2007, the USMC announced the first V-22 combat deployment at Al Asad Airbase, Iraq.\nV-22s in Iraq's Anbar province were used for transport and scout missions. General David Petraeus, the top U.S. military commander in Iraq, used one to visit troops on Christmas\u00a0Day\u00a02007; as did Barack Obama during his 2008 presidential campaign tour in Iraq. USMC Col. Kelly recalled how visitors were reluctant to fly on the unfamiliar aircraft, but after seeing its speed and ability to fly above ground fire, \"All of a sudden, the entire flight schedule was booked. No senior officer wanted to go anywhere unless they could fly on the V-22\". Obtaining spares proved problematic. By July 2008, the V-22 had flown 3,000 sorties totaling 5,200 hours in Iraq. General George J. Trautman III praised its greater speed and range over legacy helicopters, saying \"it turned his battle space from the size of Texas into the size of Rhode Island.\" Despite attacks by man-portable air-defense systems and small arms, none were lost to enemy fire by late 2009.\nA Government Accountability Office study stated that by January 2009, the 12 MV-22s in Iraq had completed all assigned missions; mission capable rates averaged 57% to 68%, and an overall full mission capable rate of 6%. It also noted weaknesses in situational awareness, maintenance, shipboard operations and transport capability. The report concluded: \"deployments confirmed that the V-22's enhanced speed and range enable personnel and internal cargo to be transported faster and farther than is possible with the legacy helicopters\".\nMV-22s deployed to Afghanistan in November 2009 with VMM-261; it saw its first offensive combat mission, Operation Cobra's Anger, on 4 December 2009. V-22s assisted in inserting 1,000 USMC and 150 Afghan troops into the Now Zad Valley of Helmand Province in southern Afghanistan to disrupt Taliban operations. General James Amos stated that Afghanistan's MV-22s had surpassed 100,000 flight hours, calling it \"the safest airplane, or close to the safest airplane\" in the USMC inventory. The V-22's Afghan deployment was set to end in late 2013 with the drawdown of combat operations; however, VMM-261 was directed to extend operations for casualty evacuation, being quicker than helicopters enabled more casualties to reach a hospital within the 'golden hour'; they were fitted with medical equipment such as heart monitors and triage supplies.\nIn January 2010, the MV-22 was sent to Haiti as part of Operation Unified Response relief efforts after an earthquake, the type's first humanitarian mission. In March 2011, two MV-22s from helped rescue a downed USAF F-15E crew member during Operation Odyssey Dawn. On 2 May 2011, following Operation Neptune's Spear, the body of Osama bin Laden, founder of the al-Qaeda terrorist group, was flown by an MV-22 to the aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea, prior to his burial at sea.\nIn 2013, several MV-22s received communications and seating modifications to support the Marine One presidential transport squadron because of the urgent need for CH-53Es in Afghanistan. In May 2010, Boeing announced plans to submit the V-22 for the VXX presidential transport replacement.\nFrom 2 to 5 August 2013, two MV-22s completed the longest distance Osprey tanking mission to date. Flying from Marine Corps Air Station Futenma in Okinawa alongside two KC-130J tankers, they flew to Clark Air Base in the Philippines on 2 August; then to Darwin, Australia, on 3 August; to Townsville, Australia, on 4 August; and finally rendezvoused with on 5 August.\nIn 2013, the USMC formed an intercontinental response force, the Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force \u2013 Crisis Response \u2013 Africa, using V-22s outfitted with specialized communications gear. In 2013, following Typhoon Haiyan, 12 MV-22s of the 3rd Marine Expeditionary Brigade were deployed to the Philippines for disaster relief operations; its abilities were described as \"uniquely relevant\", flying faster and with greater payloads while moving supplies throughout the island archipelago.\nOn 9 October 2014, the last operational Marine Corps CH-46 squadron, HMM-364, re-designated as VMM-364. On 1 August 2015, the Marine Corps retired its final CH-46 and completed its transition from CH-46 Sea Knight to the MV-22 Osprey.\nU.S. Air Force.\nThe USAF's first operational CV-22 was delivered to the 58th Special Operations Wing (58th SOW) at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico, in March 2006. Early aircraft were delivered to the 58th SOW and used for training personnel for special operations use. On 16 November 2006, the USAF officially accepted the CV-22 in a ceremony conducted at Hurlburt Field, Florida. The USAF's first operational deployment sent four CV-22s to Mali in November 2008 in support of Exercise Flintlock. The CV-22s flew nonstop from Hurlburt Field, Florida, with in-flight refueling. AFSOC declared that the 8th Special Operations Squadron reached Initial Operational Capability in March 2009, with six CV-22s in service.\nIn December 2013, three CV-22s came under small arms fire while trying to evacuate American civilians in Bor, South Sudan, during the 2013 South Sudanese political crisis; the aircraft flew to Entebbe, Uganda, after the mission was aborted. South Sudanese officials stated that the attackers were rebels. The CV-22s had flown to Bor over three countries across . The formation was hit 119 times, wounding four crew and causing flight control failures and hydraulic and fuel leaks on all three aircraft. Fuel leaks resulted in multiple air-to-air refuelings en route. After the incident, AFSOC developed optional armor floor panels.\nThe USAF found that \"CV-22 wake modeling is inadequate for a trailing aircraft to make accurate estimations of safe separation [distance] from the preceding aircraft.\" In 2015, the USAF sought to configure the CV-22 to perform combat search and rescue in addition to its long-range special operations transport mission. It would complement the HH-60G Pave Hawk and planned HH-60W rescue helicopters, being employed in scenarios where high speed is better suited to search and rescue than more nimble but slower helicopters. In 2019, a plan was formulated for the USAF V-22 to use the AN/APQ-187 Silent Knight terrain avoidance radar, which was tested on the CV-22 at Eglin Air Force base by 2020. This radar is used on many Air Force aircraft, such as C-130 Hercules transport aircraft and MH-47 Chinook helicopters.\nOn 29 November 2023, a CV-22B assigned to the US Air Force's 353rd Special Operations Wing crashed into the East China Sea off Yakushima Island, Japan, killing all eight airmen aboard. The Osprey, based at Yokota Air Base, was flying from Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni to Kadena Air Base on Okinawa Island in clear weather and light winds. An Air Force investigation into the cause of the crash is ongoing. A preliminary investigation has revealed a \"potential materiel failure\" could have caused the accident. On 6 December 2023, the U.S. Navy (NAVAIR) and the Air Force (AFSOC) grounded their V-22 fleets. Japan (Maritime Self Defense Force) also has grounded their fleet. In early March the US and Japan resumed flights of the V-22 with revised maintenance and pilot training focuses but no changes to the aircraft. The V-22 was returned to flight with no changes; the part that failed was identified and how it failed determined, although the accident was still under scrutiny. A near crash in December 2024 led to another operation pause, over concerns about metal fatigue.\nU.S. Navy.\nThe V-22 program originally included Navy 48 HV-22s, but none were ordered. In 2009, it was proposed that it replace the C-2 Greyhound for carrier onboard delivery (COD) duties. One advantage of the V-22 is the ability to deliver supplies and people between non-carrier ships beyond helicopter range. Proponents said that it is capable of similar speed, payload capacity, and lift performance to the C-2, and can carry greater payloads over short ranges, up to 20,000\u00a0lb, including suspended external loads. The C-2 can only deliver cargo to carriers, requiring further distribution to smaller vessels via helicopters, while the V-22 is certified for operating upon amphibious ships, aircraft carriers, and logistics ships. It could also take some helicopter roles by fitting a 600\u00a0lb hoist to the ramp and a cabin configuration for 12 non-ambulatory patients and 5 seats for medical attendants. Bell and P&amp;W designed a frame for the V-22 to transport the Pratt &amp; Whitney F135 engine of the F-35.\nOn 5 January 2015, the Navy and USMC signed a memorandum of understanding to buy the V-22 for the COD mission. Initially designated HV-22, four aircraft were bought each year from 2018 to 2020. It incorporates an extended-range fuel system for an unrefueled range, a high-frequency radio for over-the-horizon communications, and a public address system to communicate with passengers; the range increase comes from extra fuel bladders in larger external sponsons, the only external difference from other variants. Its primary mission is long-range logistics; other conceivable missions include personnel recovery and special warfare. In February 2016, the Navy officially designated it the \"CMV-22B\". The Navy's Program of Record originally called for 48 aircraft, but it was later determined that only 44 were required. Production began in FY 2018, and deliveries started in 2020.\nThe Navy ordered the first 39 CMV-22Bs in June 2018; initial operating capability was achieved in 2021, with fielding to the fleet by the mid-2020s. The first CMV-22B made its initial flight in December 2019. The first deployment began in summer 2021 aboard USS \"Carl Vinson\". The Navy is planning an upgraded gearbox for their CMV-22B.\nJapan Self-Defense Forces.\nJapan bought the V-22 and they entered defense service in 2020, becoming the first international customer for the tiltrotor.\nIn 2012, Defense Minister Satoshi Morimoto ordered an investigation of the costs of V-22 operations. The V-22's capabilities exceeded current Japan Self-Defense Forces helicopters in terms of range, speed and payload. The ministry anticipated deployments to the Nansei Islands and the Senkaku Islands, as well as in multinational cooperation with the U.S. In November 2014, the Japanese Ministry of Defense decided to procure 17 V-22s. The first V-22 for Japan undertook its first flight in August 2017 and the aircraft began delivery to the Japanese military in 2020.\nIn September 2018, the Japanese Ministry of Defense decided to delay the deployment of the first five MV-22Bs it had received amid opposition and ongoing negotiations in the Saga Prefecture, where the aircraft are to be based. On 8 May 2020, the first two of the five aircraft were delivered to the JGSDF at Kisarazu Air Field after failing to reach an agreement with Saga prefecture residents. It is planned to eventually station some V-22s on board the s. In September 2023, the first V-22 landings were conducted on the helicopter carrier . The aircraft are planned to be based at Saga Airport in Kyushu starting in 2025 where the V-22s will be deployed together with Sikorsky Black Hawk and Apache Longbow helicopters in order to better defend Japan's southern Nansei Islands.\nFollowing the fatal crash of a US Air Force CV-22 off Yakushima on 29 November 2023, Japan suspended flights of its 14 MV-22s. In early 2024 it was reported that the Japanese would resume flights of the V-22, and in March 2024 flights resumed.\nPotential operators.\nThe V-22 can carry a power-module of certain fighter jets such as the F-35, and also is noted it could be useful to nations with island chains or carriers. One question was why the U.S. Army did not procure the V-22 Osprey, and it was actually in the project at the start, but ended up heavily investing in traditional rotor craft such as the UH-60 Black Hawk and CH-47 Chinook. The V-22 production line is planned to be open to around 2026 to complete the orders for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps.\nEarly on in the 2010s, some of the possible export buyers included Canada, Japan, United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom. Other potential interest came from India and Indonesia. In Europe, there was some interest on the continent from France, Spain, and Italy also. Canada is thought to have considered the V-22 for the Fixed Wing Search and Rescue (FWSAR), but it was not entered as the overall goals prioritized conventional aircraft; that program was won by the C-295, a fixed-wing medium transport.\nThe Air Force is also considering some additional V-22 for search and rescue, to supplement the HH-60W with a longer range aircraft, especially in the Indo-Pacific region where longer range is typically needed.\nFrance.\nFrance showed some interest in the V-22 especially for naval operations. It tested the V-22 in operations on their ships, and also their aircraft carrier . The French had a two-year-long program to insure that the V-22 could operate from their \"Mistral\"-class vessels working with USMC V-22.\nIndia.\nIn 2015, the Indian Aviation Research Centre showed interest in acquiring four V-22s for personnel evacuation in hostile conditions, logistic supplies, and deployment of the Special Frontier Force in border areas. US V-22s performed relief operations after the April 2015 Nepal earthquake. The Indian Navy also studied the V-22 rather than the E-2D for airborne early warning and control to replace the short-range Kamov Ka-31. India is interested in purchasing six attack version V-22s for rapid troop insertion in border areas.\nIndonesia.\nOn 6 July 2020, the U.S. State Department announced that they had approved a possible Foreign Military Sale to Indonesia of eight Block C MV-22s and related equipment for an estimated cost of $2\u00a0billion (~$ in 2024). The U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified Congress of this possible sale. The sale was approved, but in the end Indonesia decided against the purchase at that time due to the cost. It was noted that the V-22 could provide a unique logistical support to the island chain nation, but the concerns about purchase and maintenance costs were an issue.\nIsrael.\nOn 22 April 2013, an agreement was signed to sell six V-22 to the Israeli Air Force. By the end of 2016, Israel had not ordered the V-22 and was instead interested in buying the CH-47 Chinook helicopter or the CH-53K helicopter. As of 2017, Israel had frozen its evaluation of the V-22, \"with a senior defence source indicating that the tiltrotor is unable to perform some missions currently conducted using its Sikorsky CH-53 transport helicopters.\"\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe U.K. has had a watchful eye on V-22 program, and a combined UK/US study evaluated possible use. One of the more serious evaluations, came in the late 2010s when it was considered to use them on the new carriers. In the 2020s, it was thought to be one of the possible aircraft for the U.K.'s New Medium Helicopter program but was not a finalist, a program that is seeking to replace the Westland Puma medium helicopter fleet.\nThe V-22 has been used on training exercises in the U.K. which has helped identify some issues, such as that the downwash can disrupt landing mats.\nVariants.\nThe preproduction model was called the V-22. USMC operates the MV-22B including the VIP V-22s, the USAF the CV-22B, and the Navy CMV-22B. \nAccidents.\nThe V-22 Osprey has had 16 hull-loss accidents with a total of 62 fatalities as of 2023[ [update]]. During testing from 1991 to 2000, there were four crashes causing 30 fatalities. As of 2023[ [update]], the V-22 has had 13 crashes which caused 32 fatalities since becoming operational in 2007. The aircraft's accident history has generated controversy over its perceived safety issues. Following the November 2023 crash in Japan, the Osprey was grounded for three months.\nSpecifications (MV-22B).\n\"Data from\" \"Norton\", \"Boeing\", \"Bell Guide\", \"Naval Air Systems Command\", \"and USAF CV-22 fact sheet\"General characteristics* Crew: 3\u20134 (pilot, copilot and 1 or 2 flight engineers/crew chiefs/loadmasters/gunners)* Capacity: &lt;br&gt;\nPerformance* Endurance: * g limits: +4 max / -1 min\nArmament\n * 1 \u00d7 7.62\u00a0mm (.308\u00a0in) M240 machine gun or .50\u00a0in (12.7\u00a0mm) M2 Browning machine gun on ramp, removable\nAvionics\n * AN/ARC-182 VHF/UHF radio\nSee also.\nRelated development\nAircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era\nRelated lists\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
