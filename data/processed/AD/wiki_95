He has performed solo, and has led numerous groups, including the Dots, the Coloured Girls, and the Messengers. He has worked with other artists and groups, including associated projects Professor Ratbaggy and Stardust Five. Kelly's music style has ranged from bluegrass to studio-oriented dub reggae, but his core output straddles folk, rock and country. His lyrics capture the vastness of the culture and landscape of Australia by chronicling life about him for over 30 years. David Fricke from \"Rolling Stone\" calls Kelly \"one of the finest songwriters I have ever heard, Australian or otherwise\". Kelly has said, \"Song writing is mysterious to me. I still feel like a total beginner. I don't feel like I have got it nailed yet.\"\nAfter growing up in Adelaide, Kelly travelled around Australia before settling in Melbourne in 1976. He became involved in the pub rock scene and drug culture and recorded two albums with the Dots. Kelly moved to Sydney by 1985, where he formed Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls. The band was renamed Paul Kelly and the Messengers, initially only for international releases, to avoid possible racial interpretations of the word \"coloured\". At the end of the 1980s, Kelly returned to Melbourne, and in 1991 he disbanded the Messengers.\nKelly's Top 40 singles include \"Billy Baxter\", \"Before Too Long\", \"Darling It Hurts\", \"To Her Door\" (his highest-charting local hit in 1987), \"Dumb Things\" (appeared on United States charts in 1988) and \"Roll on Summer\". Top-20 albums include \"Gossip\", \"Under the Sun\", \"Comedy\", \"Songs from the South\" (1997 compilation), \"...Nothing but a Dream\", \"Stolen Apples\", \"Spring and Fall\", \"The Merri Soul Sessions\", \"Seven Sonnets and a Song\", \"Death's Dateless Night\" (with Charlie Owen), \"Life Is Fine\" (his first number-one album) and \"Nature\". Kelly has won 14 Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Music Awards, including his induction into their hall of fame in 1997. Dan Kelly, his nephew, is a singer and guitarist in his own right. Dan performed with Kelly on \"Ways and Means\" and \"Stolen Apples\". Both were members of Stardust Five, which released a self-titled album in 2006. On 22 September 2010, Kelly released his memoir, \"How to Make Gravy\", which he described as \"it's not traditional; it's writing around the A\u2013Z theme \u2013 I tell stories around the song lyrics in alphabetical order\". His biographical film \"\", directed by Ian Darling, was released to cinemas in October 2012.\nIn 2001, the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) listed the Top 30 Australian songs of all time, which included Kelly's \"To Her Door\", and \"Treaty\", written by Kelly and members of Yothu Yindi. Aside from \"Treaty\", Kelly wrote or co-wrote several songs on Indigenous Australian social issues and historical events. He provided songs for many other artists, tailoring them to their particular vocal range. The album \"Women at the Well\" from 2002 had 14 female artists record his songs in tribute.\nKelly was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2017 for distinguished service to the performing arts and to the promotion of the national identity through contributions as a singer, songwriter and musician. Kelly was married and divorced twice; he has three children and resides in St Kilda, a suburb of Melbourne.\nEarly life and education.\nPaul Maurice Kelly was born on 13 January 1955 in Adelaide, to John Erwin Kelly, a lawyer, and Josephine (n\u00e9e Filippini), the sixth of eight surviving children. According to \"Rip It Up\" magazine, \"legend has it\" that Kelly's mother gave birth to him \"in a taxi outside North Adelaide's Calvary Hospital\".\nAlthough Kelly was raised as a Roman Catholic, he later described himself as a non-believer. He is the great-great-grandson of Jeremiah Kelly, who emigrated from Ireland in 1852 and settled in Clare, South Australia. His paternal grandfather, Francis Kelly, established a law firm in 1917, which his father, John, joined in 1937.\nJohn Kelly died in 1968 at the age of 52, after having been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease three years earlier. Paul Kelly was thirteen years old when his father died. Kelly described his father: \"I have good memories, he was the kind of father that, well, I missed him when he died very much. The older children were growing into him at the time he died. He was not well enough to play sport with me.\"\nKelly's maternal grandfather was an Argentine-born, Italian-speaking opera singer, Count Ercole Filippini, a leading baritone for the La Scala Opera Company in Milan.\nFilippini was touring Australia in 1914 with a Spanish opera company when World War I broke out; Filippini stayed and later married Anne McPharland, one of his students. As Countessa Anne Filippini, she was Australia's first female symphony orchestra conductor. She sang the role of Marguerite in Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) Radio Perth's performance of \"Faust\" in 1928.\nKelly's grandparents started the Italo-Australian Opera Company, which toured the country in the 1920s.\nJosephine raised the younger children alone after John's death, but found time to assist others in need. Paul's oldest sister, Anne, became a nun and went on to write hymns, while a younger sister, Mary-Jo, plays piano in Latin bands and teaches music.\nHis eldest brother, Martin, worked for Edmund Rice International, he died in 2021 at the age of 69. Another brother, Tony, a drug and alcohol counsellor, ran as an Australian Greens candidate in the 2001 and 2004 federal elections. Josephine Kelly moved to Brisbane, where she died in 2000 at the age of 76.\nKelly attended Rostrevor College, a Christian Brothers school, where he played trumpet and studied piano, became the first XI cricket captain, played in the first XVIII football (Australian rules), and was named dux of his senior year. He studied arts at Flinders University in 1973, but left after a term, disillusioned with academic life. He began writing prose and started a magazine with some friends.\nKelly spent several years working odd jobs, travelling around the country and learning guitar before he moved to Melbourne in 1976.\nCareer.\n1974\u20131984: Early career and with the Dots.\nWhile travelling around Australia, Paul Kelly made his first public performance in 1974 in Hobart. He later recalled:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I was living there at the time and there was a folk club at Salamanca Place. They had a night, I think a Monday night, where anyone could get up. I sang Dylan's \"Girl from North Country\" and \"Streets of Forbes\", a traditional Australian song about Ben Hall. I can't really remember how it went \u2013 I remember I had a lot to drink afterwards from relief. I was incredibly nervous.\nHis first published song, \"It's the Falling Apart that Makes You\", was written after listening to Van Morrison's \"Astral Weeks\" at the age of 19, although in an interview with \"Drum Media\" he recalled writing his first song: \"It was an open-tuning and had four lines about catching trains. I have got a recording of it somewhere. It was called 'Catching a Train'. I wrote a lot of songs about trains early on, trains and fires, and then I moved on to water\".\nIn 1976, Kelly appeared on \"Debutantes\", a compilation album featuring various Melbourne-based artists, and joined pub-rockers The High Rise Bombers from 1977 to 1978. The High Rise Bombers included Kelly (vocals, guitar, songwriter), Martin Armiger (guitar, vocals, songwriter), Lee Cass (bass guitar), Chris Dyson (guitar), Sally Ford (saxophone, songwriter), John Lloyd (drums), and Keith Shadwick (saxophone). Chris Langman (guitar, vocals) replaced Dyson in early 1978. [Langman never played with the High Rise Bombers and is incorrectly listed as a guitarist on the \"Melbourne Club\" album]. In August, after Armiger left for The Sports and Ford for the Kevins, Kelly formed Paul Kelly and the Dots with Langman and Lloyd. The High Rise Bombers recorded two tracks, \"She's Got It\" and \"Domestic Criminal\", which appeared on \"The Melbourne Club\", a 1981 compilation by various artists on Missing Link Records. \nKelly had already established himself as a respected songwriter\u2014other Melbourne musicians would go to see him on their nights off. Richard Guilliatt, writing for \"The Monthly\", later described Kelly from a 1979 performance at Richmond's Kingston Hotel, the singer was \"a skinny guy with a head of black curls framing a pale face and a bent nose... singing with his eyes closed, one arm outstretched and the other resting on the body of the Fender Telecaster\". Kelly was introduced to Hilary Brown at one of the Dots' gigs and they later married \u2013 the relationship is described in \"When I First Met Your Ma\" (1992). Brown's father supplied Kelly with a gravy recipe \u2013 used on \"How to Make Gravy\" (1996). Their son, Declan, was born in 1980.\nThe Dots included various line-ups from 1978 to 1982. The band released their debut single \"Recognition\" in 1979, which did not reach the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart top\u00a050. The Dots then signed to Mushroom Records, and at the record company's insistence, were renamed Paul Kelly and the Dots. They issued \"Billy Baxter\" in November 1980, which peaked at No.\u00a038. Rock music historian, Ian McFarlane described the single as a \"delightful, ska-tinged\" track. Kelly's first television performance was \"Billy Baxter\" on the national pop show \"Countdown\". Their debut album, \"Talk\", followed in March 1981, which reached No.\u00a044 on the Kent Music Report Albums Chart. Late in 1981 Paul Kelly and the Dots recorded their second album, \"Manila\", in the Philippines' capital. It was issued in August 1982, but had no chart success. Release was delayed by line-up changes and because Kelly was assaulted in Melbourne \u2013 he had his jaw broken.\nIn an October 1982 interview with \"The Australian Women's Weekly\", Kelly indicated he was more pleased with \"Manila\" than \"Talk\" as \"It has more unity ... with this one we didn't have people dropping into the studio to play.\" Years later Kelly disavowed both Dots albums: \"I wish I could grab the other two and put 'em in a big hole\". The 1982 film, \"Starstruck\", was directed by Gillian Armstrong and starred Jo Kennedy. Paul Kelly and the Dots supplied \"Rocking Institution\" for its soundtrack and Kelly added to the score. Kennedy released \"Body and Soul\", a cover of Split Enz' \"She Got Body, She Got Soul\" as a shared single with \"Rocking Institution\". Acting in a minor role in \"Starstruck\" was Kaarin Fairfax, who later became Kelly's second wife. Kelly was without a recording contract after the Dots folded in 1982.\nPaul Kelly Band was formed in 1983 with Michael Armiger (Martin Armiger's younger brother, bass guitar), Chris Coyne (saxophone), Maurice Frawley (guitar) and Greg Martin (drums). By 1984 Michael Barclay (ex-the Zimmermen) replaced Martin on drums and Graham Lee (guitar, pedal steel guitar) joined. Kelly's involvement in the Melbourne drug culture\u2014he described his heroin addiction as \"a long period of occasional use\"\u2014resulted in erratic performances. Problems with his marriage and drug use disrupted his career, and by 1984 the marriage had broken up. Hilary had moved to Sydney, initially leaving their young son with Kelly. He disbanded the group three months later and relocated to Sydney so he could share parenting responsibilities with Hilary while Declan grew up.\n1985\u20131991: Coloured Girls to Messengers.\nPaul Kelly stayed with Don Walker (Cold Chisel) in Kings Cross \u2013 Walker had lived with Hilary's sister \u2013 and wrote new songs on Walker's piano. Kelly then moved into a flat with Paul Hewson (Dragon) in Elizabeth Bay. Both Walker and Hewson encouraged Kelly to continue with his song-writing. By January 1985, he recorded the self-funded album\u2014at a cost of $3,500\u2014\"Post\". Session musicians included Michael Barclay (Weddings Parties Anything) on harmonies, guitarist Steve Connolly (the Zimmermen), and bass guitarist Ian Rilen (Rose Tattoo, X). They spent two weeks recording at Clive Shakespeare's studio. Shakespeare engineered the album and co-produced with Kelly. It was released in May 1985 on the independent label White Records, and licensed to Mushroom Records.\nKelly dedicated \"Post\" to his former flatmate, Hewson, who had died of a heroin overdose in January. According to McFarlane: \"[it's] a stark, highly personalised collection of acoustic songs that showcased the extraordinary breadth of Kelly's songwriting skills.\" \"Rolling Stone\" (Australia) hailed \"Post\" as the best record of 1985. AllMusic's Mike DeGagne felt \"While he focuses on life's daily tragedies and tribulations, there is a missing element in the music, as it lacks any vigor or flash\". A single, \"From St Kilda to Kings Cross\", was released from the album, but did not chart. Russell Crowe, during his first trip to the US, visited the tourist venue of Death Valley and used \"Post\" to refocus himself: \"[his] concise insights and acerbic wisdom are exactly the music for strolling the bottom of ancient oceans, both literal and metaphoric\". After recording \"Post\", Kelly established a full-time band, which included Armiger, Barclay, and Connolly, bass guitarist Jon Schofield, and keyboardist Peter Bull.\nPaul Kelly and the Coloured Girls were named through a joke based on Lou Reed's song \"Walk on the Wild Side\". Armiger soon left, and the Coloured Girls line-up stabilised in late 1985 as Barclay, Bull, Connolly, and Schofield. Stuart Coupe, Kelly's manager, advised him to sign with Regular Records due to difficulty re-signing with Mushroom's Michael Gudinski. Michelle Higgins, Mushroom's public relations officer, was a Kelly supporter and locked herself into a Sebel Townhouse Hotel room\u2014at Mushroom's expense\u2014for nearly a week in mid-1986, and refused to leave until Gudinski had signed Kelly to a two-album recording contract. Kelly performed for The Rock Party, a charity project initiated by The National Campaign Against Drug Abuse, which included other Australasian musicians. The Rock Party released a 12\" single, \"Everything to Live For\", which was produced by Joe Wissert, Phil Rigger, and Phil Beazley.\nIn September, Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls released a 24-track double LP, \"Gossip\". The album included remakes of four songs from \"Post\", and also featured \"Maralinga (Rainy Land)\", a song about the effects of British nuclear tests on the Maralinga Tjarutja (indigenous people of Maralinga, South Australia). \"Gossip\" peaked at No.\u00a015, with singles chart success for \"Before Too Long\" which peaked at No.\u00a015, and \"Darling It Hurts\" which reached No.\u00a025. A single LP version of \"Gossip\" featuring 15 songs was issued in the United States by A&amp;M Records in July 1987. DeGagne noted that \"[it] bursts at the seams with blustery, distinguished tunes captivating both the somberness and the intrigue thrown forward from this fine Australian storyteller\".\n\"Gossip\" was co-produced by Kelly and Alan Thorne (Hoodoo Gurus, The Stems) who, according to music journalist Robert Forster (former The Go-Betweens singer-songwriter), helped the band create \"a sound that will not only influence future roots-rock bands but, through its directness, sparkle and dedication to the song, will also come to be seen as particularly Australian. Ultimately, it means the records these people made together are timeless\". Due to possible racist connotations, the band changed its name for international releases to Paul Kelly and the Messengers. They made a US tour, initially supporting Crowded House and then headlining, travelling across the US by bus. \"Darling It Hurts\" peaked at No.\u00a019 on the \"Billboard\" Mainstream Rock chart in 1987. \"The New York Times\" rock critic Jon Pareles wrote \"Mr. Kelly sang one smart, catchy three-minute song after another \u2013 dozens of them \u2013 as the band played with no-frills directness\" following the band's performance at the Bottom Line Club in New York.\nPaul Kelly and the Coloured Girls' second album, \"Under the Sun\", was released in late 1987 in Australia and New Zealand, and in early 1988 in North America and Europe (under the name Paul Kelly and the Messengers). On the Kent Music Report Albums Chart, it reached No.\u00a019. The lead single \"To Her Door\", written by Kelly, peaked at No.\u00a014 on the related singles chart. Forster indicated that the song demonstrated one of Kelly's finest qualities as a songwriter which is his unforced empathy. DeGagne observed a style similar to Elvis Costello and Steve Forbert, and said the album provided \"acoustically bright story songs and character-based tales with unlimited substance\".\nAnother single, \"Dumb Things\", was released in early 1989 and attained No.\u00a036 on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Singles Chart. In the US, it reached No.\u00a016 on the \"Billboard\" Modern Rock chart. The song was included on the soundtrack for the 1988 Yahoo Serious film \"Young Einstein\". The video, directed by Claudia Castle, won an ARIA Award for 'Best Video'. Kelly met Kaarin Fairfax, his second wife, in 1988 and they married in 1993. From 1989 to 1992 Fairfax supplied backing vocals on tracks by Paul Kelly and the Messengers. In 1990, as country music artist Mary-Jo Starr, she released three singles and an album, \"Too Many Movies\", using the Messengers and Kelly as session musicians. Michael Armiger, Connolly, and Frawley were in her backing tour band, The Drive-in Motel. Fairfax and Kelly's two children are Madeleine and Memphis.\n\"So Much Water So Close to Home\" was released in 1989 by Paul Kelly and the Messengers in all markets. It peaked at No.\u00a010 on the ARIA Albums Chart, but none of its singles reached the ARIA Top\u00a040 Singles Chart. Forster stated that, with \"Everything's Turning to White\", Kelly shows mastery in condensing a Raymond Carver tale of fishermen who discover a dead woman's body but continue to fish before reporting their find. The same short story was used for the 2006 film, \"Jindabyne\", for which Kelly composed the soundtrack. DeGagne preferred \"Everything's Turning to White\" and \"Sweet Guy\" to the other album tracks, which \"seem a little weak in the content department\". Kelly relocated back to Melbourne after having lived in Sydney for six years. Another US tour was undertaken, but there was no further chart success for albums or singles released in the US market.\nIn 1991 the band released \"Comedy\", which peaked at No.\u00a012 on the ARIA Albums Chart. DeGagne noticed \"a folk-filled tinge to each song, but the occasional quickened pace balances out these tunes rather nicely\". \"From Little Things Big Things Grow\", a seven-minute track from the album, was co-written by Kelly and Kev Carmody. It highlights the Gurindji Strike and Vincent Lingiari as part of the Indigenous Australian struggle for land rights and reconciliation. Forster indicates it has Dylanesque influences, and shows Kelly \"honing the skills of a fine balladeer and storyteller\". A cover version that was released in May 2008 by The GetUp Mob, part of the GetUp! advocacy group, peaked at No.\u00a04 on the ARIA singles charts. This version included samples from speeches by Prime Ministers Paul Keating in 1992 and Kevin Rudd in 2008. It featured vocals by Carmody and Kelly, as well as other Australian artists. Kelly collaborated with members of indigenous band Yothu Yindi to write \"Treaty\", which peaked at No.\u00a011 in September 1991.\n\"To Her Door\" and \"Treaty\" were voted into the APRA Top 30 Australian songs of all time in 2001. Paul Kelly and the Messengers gave their last performance in August 1991, with Kelly set to pursue a solo career. He justified his decision: \"We forged a style together. But I felt if we had kept going it would have got formulaic and that's why I broke it up. I wanted to try and start moving into other areas, start mixing things up\". Paul Kelly and the Messengers' final album, \"Hidden Things\", was a collection of previously released B-sides, stray non-LP tracks, radio sessions, and other rarities. It was released in May 1992, and reached No.\u00a029. One track, \"Rally Around the Drum\", written with Archie Roach, was about an indigenous tent boxing man.\n1992\u20131999: Solo career and with others.\nSince 1992 Paul Kelly has had a solo career, fronted the Paul Kelly Band, and worked in occasional collaborations with other songwriters and performers. In 1992 he was asked to compose songs for \"Funerals and Circuses\", a Roger Bennett play about racial tensions in small-town Australia. Kelly took the role of a petrol attendant when the play premiered at the Adelaide Fringe Festival that year and was directed by his wife, Fairfax. Kelly co-wrote \"Hey Boys\" with Mark Seymour (Hunters &amp; Collectors) for the soundtrack of the 1992 Australian film, \"Garbo\"; when released as a single it peaked at No.\u00a062. Kelly contributed songs and vocals to the soundtrack of the 1993 television series \"Seven Deadly Sins\".\nKelly's first post-Messengers solo release was the live double CD \"Live, May 1992\", released in November 1992. AllMusic's Brett Hartenbach noted that Kelly's band had fleshed out his songs in the studio, but he was still able to show \"his vignettes of life, love, and the underbelly of both have plenty of power on their own\". Kelly had relocated to Los Angeles and signed with Vanguard Records to tour the US as a solo artist. While in Los Angeles he produced fellow Australian Ren\u00e9e Geyer's album \"Difficult Woman\" (1994). Kelly returned to Australia in 1993 and wrote a collection of lyrics, aptly titled \"Lyrics\", which opens with a quote from Anton Chekhov: \"I don't have what you would call a philosophy or coherent world view so I shall have to limit myself to describing how my heroes love, marry, give birth, die and speak.\"\nHis next album \"Wanted Man\", released in 1994, reached No.\u00a011. Kelly also composed music for the 1994 film \"Everynight ... Everynight\", directed by Alkinos Tsilimidos. It is set in the notorious H division of Victoria's Pentridge Prison. Kelly's next solo releases were \"Deeper Water\" in 1995 and \"Live at the Continental and the Esplanade\" in 1996. Between March and May 1995 Kelly undertook a seven-week tour of North America, appearing on several dates with Liz Phair and Joe Jackson.\nBy 1996, Paul Kelly Band members included Stephen Hadley (bass, ex-Black Sorrows), Bruce Haymes (keyboards), Peter Luscombe (drums, ex-Black Sorrows), and Shane O'Mara (guitar). Spencer P. Jones (Beasts of Bourbon) was guest guitarist on some performances. This line-up issued the CD-EP \"How to Make Gravy\", with the title track earning Kelly a 'Song of the Year' nomination at the 1998 Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) Music Awards. APRA's Debbie Kruger noted Kelly's \"attraction to the theatrical\" where the same protagonist is described in \"To Her Door\", \"Love Never Runs on Time\" (from \"Wanted Man\") and \"How to Make Gravy\".\nIn 1997, Kelly released his compilation album, \"Songs from the South: Paul Kelly's Greatest Hits\", on Mushroom Records. The 20-track album peaked at No.\u00a02, and has achieved quadruple platinum certification, indicating sales of over 280,000. Kelly won the ARIA Award in 1997 for 'Best Male Artist', having been previously nominated in 1993, 1995, and 1996. At 20 September 1997 ceremony, he was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame. Kelly won the 'Best Male Artist' award again in 1998, and has been nominated for the same award a further seven times.\nKelly's next album, \"Words and Music\", appeared in 1998, which peaked at No.\u00a017, and included three singles that did not reach the Top 40. Andrew Ford interviewed Kelly for ABC radio's \"The Music Show\" in May. Ford found the album \"very exciting, very visceral ... you can almost smell the sex\". Kelly admitted that he preferred R &amp; B music which deals with sex, love, and joy without becoming \"either banal or smug\". He finds such songs more difficult to write but believes he has started to do so. 1998 also saw Kelly undertaking a three-week tour of Canada and the US to promote \"Words and Music\".\n\"Smoke\" was released by Paul Kelly with Uncle Bill; the latter is a Melbourne bluegrass band comprising Gerry Hale on guitar, dobro, mandolin, fiddle, and vocals; Adam Gare on fiddle, mandolin, and vocals; Peter Somerville on banjo and vocals; and Stuart Speed on double bass. The album featured a mix of old and new Kelly songs treated in classic bluegrass fashion. \"Our Sunshine\", newly written, was a tribute to Ned Kelly, a famous Australian outlaw (not related). Kelly had previously recorded a Slim Dusty track with Uncle Bill, \"Thanks a Lot\", for the compilation \"Where Joy Kills Sorrow\" (1997). \"Smoke\" was issued on Kelly's new label, Gawdaggie, through EMI Records in October 1999, and peaked at No.\u00a036. It won three awards from the Victorian Country Music Association: 'Best Group (Open)', 'Best Group (Victorian)', and 'Album of the Year' in 2000. In September Kelly performed at the Spiegeltent at the Edinburgh Festival, as well as shows in London and Dublin.\nIn 1999 Kelly formed the band Professor Ratbaggy with Hadley (bass guitar, backing vocals), Haymes (keyboards, organ, backing vocals) and Luscombe (drums). Kelly provided guitars and vocals for their debut album, \"Professor Ratbaggy\", on EMI Records. Songs were written jointly by all group members and their work was a more groove-oriented style compared to Kelly's usual folk or rock formula, using samples, synthesiser and percussion. Kelly's second anthology of lyrics entitled \"Don't Start Me Talking\" was first published in 1999, with subsequent songs appended in the 2004 edition. This second edition was added to the Victorian Certificate of Education English reading list for Year 12 (final year of secondary schooling) in 2006.\n2000\u20132009: Soundtracks and tribute albums.\nDuring the 2000s Paul Kelly worked as a composer for film and TV scores and soundtracks, including \"Lantana\" (also as a member of Professor Ratbaggy), \"Silent Partner\", and \"One Night the Moon\" in 2001, \"Fireflies\" in 2004, and \"Jindabyne\" in 2006. These works have resulted in five award wins: ARIA 'Best Original Soundtrack' for \"Lantana\" (with Hadley, Haymes and O'Mara); Australian Film Institute (AFI) 'Open Craft Award', Film Critics Circle of Australia Awards 'Best Music Score', and Screen Music Award 'Best Soundtrack Album' for \"One Night the Moon\" (with Mairead Hannan, Carmody, John Romeril, Deirdre Hannan, and Alice Garner); Valladolid International Film Festival 'Best Music' award for \"Jindabyne\"; and six further nominations.\nKelly also acted in \"One Night the Moon\" alongside his then wife, Fairfax, and with their younger daughter Memphis. All three sing on the soundtrack, including together for the lullaby, \"One Night the Moon\". According to Romaine Moreton, Australian Screen Online curator, the \"lullaby that the family sings, written by Paul Kelly, sets the tone of the film ... The song is used in this film as a vehicle to explore the characters' interior worlds, something very unusual for a film\". Kelly and Fairfax separated before the film's release.\n\"Roll on Summer\" was released in 2000 as a four-track EP, which peaked at No.\u00a040 on the ARIA singles charts. Kelly issued \"...Nothing but a Dream\" in 2001, returning to his core singer-songwriter style. It peaked at No.\u00a07 on the albums chart, and achieved gold record status. The North American version of \"...Nothing but a Dream\" added all four tracks from the \"Roll on Summer\" EP as bonus tracks. Murray Bramwell appraised four Kelly-related works in \"Adelaide Review\", \"each of them indicative of the rich variety of his gift\". On the album \"...Nothing but a Dream\", he preferred the opening track, \"If I Could Start Today Again\", to the radio single, \"Somewhere in the City\", and found the album generally to be \"full of familiar Kelly riffs and trademarks\". On \"Silent Partner\" Kelly's songwriting with Hale provides \"some splendid instrumentals\" with \"a delightfully airy sound\". The \"Lantana\" soundtrack showed Kelly's \"confidence as a composer and his strong grasp of a wide range of musical styles\". Finally, \"One Night the Moon\" included Mairead Hannan's \"richly melodic Irish airs\" which \"beautifully counterpoint Kelly's work\" and Carmody's \"distinctive ballads\".\nIn March 2001 Kelly was a support act for Bob Dylan's tour of Australia. Between August and November Kelly performed a series of acoustic shows in New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, and France (the latter supporting Ani DiFranco). In 2002 he undertook a six-week tour of North America, which was followed by a tour of the UK and Ireland later that year. In 2002 and 2003 two tribute albums of Kelly's songs were released: \"Women at the Well\" featured songs performed by female artists, including Bic Runga, Jenny Morris, Ren\u00e9e Geyer, Magic Dirt, Rebecca Barnard (Rebecca's Empire), Christine Anu, and Kasey Chambers; and \"Stories of Me\", which featured fellow songwriters James Reyne, Mia Dyson, and Jeff Lang. Chambers, a country music artist, sees Kelly as a role model: \"He's the perfect example of the storyteller that I would love to be\". In 2003 Kelly undertook a tour of North America, the UK, and Ireland, performing at the Edmonton International Fringe Festival and again at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.\n\"Ways &amp; Means\" was issued in 2004 and peaked at No.\u00a013. Though identified as a solo record, it was more of a group effort, with a backing band, later dubbed the Boon Companions, co-writing most of the tracks. The Boon Companions consisted of Kelly's nephew Dan Kelly on guitar, Peter Luscombe on drums, his brother Dan Luscombe on guitar and keyboards, and Bill McDonald on bass guitar. Bramwell was impressed with their live performance in May: \"Kelly steers and shapes not only his music, but the way he presents it. A live show is never just knocked together ... the details are always careful\". In February ABC Television started broadcasting the series \"Fireflies\", which featured a score by Kelly and Stephen Rae. The associated soundtrack CD, \"Fireflies: Songs of Paul Kelly\", included tracks by Kelly, Paul Kelly and the Boon Companions, Professor Ratbaggy, and Paul Kelly with Uncle Bill. Sian Prior sang with the Boon Companions on the \"Fireflies\" track \"Los Cucumbros\", which later appeared on \"Stardust Five\". Prior, an opera singer, became Kelly's girlfriend in 2002. They met when she interviewed him for \"Sunday Arts\" on ABC Radio. Prior is also a journalist and university lecturer.\nIn March 2004 Kelly performed across North America, including New York, Boston, Chicago, Seattle, and Los Angeles. This was followed by a more extensive series of shows between July and September throughout North America and Europe. In December, in Melbourne, Kelly performed 100 of his songs in alphabetical order over two nights. A similar set of shows were performed in a studio at Sydney Opera House in December 2006, these and similar sets became known as his A to Z shows. \"Foggy Highway\" was a second bluegrass-oriented album for Kelly, credited to Paul Kelly and the Stormwater Boys and issued in 2005. It peaked at No.\u00a023 on the ARIA albums charts. The line-up for the majority of the tracks was Kelly, Mick Albeck (fiddle), James Gillard (bass guitar), Rod McCormack (guitar), Ian Simpson (banjo), and Trev Warner (mandolin). As with \"Smoke\" (his previous bluegrass release), \"Foggy Highway\" consisted of a mix of new compositions and rearranged Kelly classics. The Canadian edition of the release included a four-song bonus EP of out-takes.\nIn June 2005 Kelly put together \"Timor Leste \u2013 Freedom Rising\", a collaboration of Australian artists donating new recordings, unreleased tracks, and b-sides to make connections between a wide range of music to raise money for environmental, health, and education projects in East Timor (Timor-Leste). Funds raised from the album went to Life, Love and Health and The Alola Foundation. On 26 March 2006 Kelly performed at the Commonwealth Games closing ceremony in Melbourne, singing \"Leaps and Bounds\" and \"Rally Around the Drum\". On 8 October Paul Kelly and the Boon Companions, Hoodoo Gurus, and Sime Nugent performed at the Athenaeum Theatre in Melbourne to again raise funds for Life, Love and Health, and to help support their ongoing programs in Timor-Leste in response to the needs of the people during the humanitarian crisis.\nKelly formed Stardust Five in 2006, with the same line-up as Paul Kelly and the Boon Companions from \"Ways &amp; Means\". They released their self-titled debut album in March, with each member contributing by composing the music and Kelly providing lyrics. The album has backing vocals by Prior on two tracks. Kelly toured North America again in 2006, appearing together with The Waifs at clubs and festivals in several US states and the Canadian province of Alberta. In November\u2013December Kelly undertook his A-Z tour, a series of solo acoustic performances playing 100 of his songs in alphabetical order over four nights, at the Brisbane Powerhouse, Melbourne's Spiegeltent, and at the Sydney Opera House.\nIn 2007 Kelly released \"Stolen Apples\", containing songs based on religious themes; it peaked at No.\u00a08, and achieved gold record status. Following the album's recording, Dan Luscombe left to join The Drones. He was replaced by Ashley Naylor (Even) on guitar and Cameron Bruce (The Polaroids) on keyboards. A tour in support of the album saw Kelly perform the entire album plus selected hits from his catalogue. One of the last performances, on 20 September 2007 in Toowoomba, was filmed and released on DVD as \"Live Apples: Stolen Apples Performed Live in its Entirety Plus 16 More Songs\", in April 2008.\nKelly made his first appearance at the Big Day Out concerts across Australia in early 2008, while in March he performed at the South by Southwest music festival in Austin, Texas. Kelly released \"Stolen Apples\" in Ireland and the UK in July, and followed with a tour there in August. In June \"The Age\" newspaper commemorated 50 years of Australian rock 'n' roll (the anniversary of the release of Johnny O'Keefe's \"Wild One\") by selecting the Top\u00a050 Australian Albums. Kelly's albums \"Gossip\" and \"Post\" rated at No.\u00a07 and No.\u00a030 on the list. Kelly was nominated as 'Best Male Artist' for \"To Her Door (Live)\" and Best Music DVD for \"Live Apples\" at the 2008 ARIA Awards. In September he announced that he had reacquired the rights to his old catalogue, including those originally released by Mushroom Records\u2014later bought out by Warner Bros. Records.\nIn November, as a result of the acquisition EMI released \"Songs from the South \u2013 Volume 2\", a collection of Kelly's songs from the last decade, following on from \"Songs from the South \u2013 Volume 1\". The new compilation featured the first physical release of Kelly's song, \"Shane Warne\". Volume 1 and Volume 2 are available separately but also as a combined double album. EMI released a DVD, \"Paul Kelly \u2013 The Video Collection 1985\u20132008\", a collection of Kelly's home videos made over the past 23 years. Also included are several live performances. \"Songs from the South \u2013 Volume 2\" included one new song, \"Thoughts in the Middle of the Night\", which he described as \"It's a band song, we all wrote it together. There's a poem by James Fenton, a British poet, called \"The Mistake\", which is probably an influence on the lyrics. It's a waking up in the middle of the night song, for anyone who's woken up at 3\u00a0am and not been able to get back to sleep\".\nIn the beginning of 2009 he supported Leonard Cohen's tour of Australia \u2013 his first return in 24 years. Kelly's duet with country singer Melinda Schneider, \"Still Here\", won 'Vocal Collaboration of the Year' at the 2009 CMAA Country Music Awards of Australia. In February, in response to hearing about the devastation to the Yarra Valley region of Victoria in Australia, Cohen and Kelly donated $200,000 to the Victorian Bushfire Appeal in support of those affected by the extensive Black Saturday bushfires that razed the area just weeks after their performance at the Rochford Winery for the \"A Day on the Green\" concert. Kelly performed at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 14 March for Sound Relief, a multi-venue rock music concert in support of victims of the bushfires. The event was held simultaneously with a concert at the Sydney Cricket Ground. All proceeds from the Melbourne concert went to the Red Cross Victorian Bushfire relief. Also performing at the Melbourne concert were Augie March, Bliss n Eso with Paris Wells, Gabriella Cilmi, Hunters &amp; Collectors, Jack Johnson, Chambers and Shane Nicholson with Troy Cassar-Daley, Kings of Leon, Jet, Midnight Oil, Liam Finn, Split Enz, and Wolfmother.\nOn 13 and 14 November, radio station Triple J presented a Kelly tribute concert\u2014marking his 30th anniversary as a solo artist\u2014at the Forum Theatre in Melbourne, and highlighted his contribution to Australian music. The line-up included Missy Higgins, John Butler, Paul Dempsey (Something for Kate), Katy Steele (Little Birdy), Bob Evans, Ozi Batla (The Herd), Dan Kelly, Clare Bowditch, Jae Laffer (The Panics), Adalita Srsen (Magic Dirt), Dan Sultan, and Megan Washington interpreting Kelly's songs, with members of Augie March as the backing band and Ashley Naylor as musical director. A recording of the concerts was released by ABC Music as a DVD and a double CD, \"Before Too Long\", with a bonus CD featuring original songs by Kelly, on 19 February 2010. Kelly's national 'More Songs from the South' tour in December 2009 included band members Vika Bull on vocals, Peter Luscombe on drums, Bill McDonald on bass guitar and backing vocals, Naylor on guitar, and Cameron Bruce on keyboards. Kelly contributed to the national magazine, \"The Monthly\", from 2009 to 2010.\n2010\u20132013: \"How to Make Gravy\", \"Stories of Me\" and \"Spring and Fall\".\nPaul Kelly published his memoir, \"How to Make Gravy\", via Penguin Books (Australia) on 22 September 2010. \"It's a mongrel memoir. It's a bit hard to describe at the moment. It's not traditional; it's writing around the A-Z theme \u2013 I tell stories around the song lyrics in alphabetical order. It's slow, so it will be a while coming, but I'll get there\". As a companion to his memoir, he issued an 8\u00d7CD box set, \"A \u2013 Z Recordings\", with live performances from his A \u2013 Z Tours from 2004 to 2010. The 105 tracks are listed alphabetically, and were typically performed over four nights. The set includes a booklet of photographs. The related audio book on 16\u00d7CDs has Kelly joined by Australian actors, Cate Blanchett, Russell Crowe, Judy Davis, Hugh Jackman and Ben Mendelsohn each reading a chosen chapter.\nMaurice Frawley, a guitarist for Kelly in various groups who co-wrote \"Look So Fine, Feel So Low\" (1987), died of cancer in May 2009. Kelly worked with Charlie Owen and others to create a 3\u00d7CD tribute album, \"Long Gone Whistle \u2013 The Songs of Maurice Frawley\", which was released in August 2010. In July that year, Kelly performed at Splendour in the Grass. On 15 December 2010 he was inducted into The Age EG Awards Hall of Fame. In April 2011 Kelly performed at the East Coast Blues &amp; Roots Music Festival (Bluesfest), which was followed by appearances as a special guest at Dylan's concerts in Sydney and Melbourne. Later that month, Kelly co-headlined a show with Neil Finn at Red Hill Auditorium in Perth; it was the first music concert at the new venue. In May his memoir, \"How to Make Gravy\", was short-listed for the Prime Minister's Literary Award in the non-fiction category; while in July it was co-winner of 'Biography of the Year' at the Australian Book Industry Awards \u2013 with Anh Do's \"The Happiest Refugee\".\nOn 29 September 2012 Kelly performed \"How to Make Gravy\" and \"Leaps and Bounds\" at the AFL Grand Final although most of the performance was not broadcast on Seven Network's pre-game segment. Nui Te Koha of \"Sunday Herald Sun\" declared \"Kelly, an integral part of Melbourne folklore and its music scene, and a noted footy tragic, deserved his place on the Grand Final stage \u2013 which has been long overdue ... broadcaster Seven's refusal to show Kelly's performance, except the last verse of 'Leaps and Bounds', was no laughing matter\". On 19 October that year, Kelly issued a new studio album, \"Spring and Fall\", which debuted at No.\u00a08. It was recorded with Dan Kelly and Machine Translations' J Walker. Guest musicians include former band members Peter and Dan Luscombe, Vika and Linda Bull, and new collaborator, Laura Jean.\nAlso in October, a biographical film, \"\", directed by Ian Darling, was released. Darling had worked on the project for two years and it included \"insights from family, friends, musicians and music journalists, as well as Kelly himself\". \"The Australian Financial Review\"'s Katrina Strickland described the documentary as \"not a critique of his music, nor an intrusive look at his personal life\" which uses a \"much less linear approach to the life of a musician whose career has spanned four decades\". After it appeared on ABC-TV in October of the following year, Andrew P. Street of \"The Guardian\" noted it \"brings an ambitious, complex young Kelly to life \u2013 making a relisten of his work essential\".\n2013\u20132016: Collaborative albums.\nDuring February and March 2013, Kelly and Neil Finn undertook a collaborative tour of Australia. Their performance on 10 March at the Sydney Opera House was recorded for the live album, \"Goin' Your Way\" (8 November 2013). It was issued as a 2\u00d7 CD, which peaked at No.\u00a05 on the ARIA Albums Chart; and also as a DVD, which peaked at No.\u00a01 on the related ARIA Music DVD Chart. Later in March, Kelly toured New Zealand with Dan Kelly to promote \"Spring and Fall\" by playing in church venues.\n\"Goin' Your Way\" was the first of several collaborative albums Kelly would release in the following years. \"The Merri Soul Sessions\" was released December 2014, and features contributions from the Bull sisters, Kira Puru, Clairy Browne and Dan Sultan. The ensemble would also tour together in late 2014 and early 2015. In 2016, Kelly would release two albums: \"Seven Sonnets and a Song\" in April, which was a musical recreation of selected works by William Shakespeare; and \"Death's Dateless Night\" in October, a covers album with Charlie Owen.\n2017\u2013present: \"Life Is Fine\" and \"Nature\".\nKelly's first solo album in five years, \"Life Is Fine\", was released in August 2017. The album became his first number-one album and won him four ARIA Awards at that year's ceremony. In November and December 2017, Kelly and his band undertook a seventeen-performance tour of thirteen metropolitan and regional Australian cities, as well as four performances in three cities in New Zealand to promote the release of \"Life is Fine\". Supports on the tour included Steve Earle, Middle Kids, Busby Marou and The Eastern. Kelly was also a featured artist on the 2018 Groovin' the Moo festival.\nIn August 2018, Kelly announced the release of a new album, \"Nature\", in October. The album's lead single, \"With the One I Love\", was released on the same day. He released another compilation album in November 2019, covering 1985\u20132019, \"\". In September 2019, he performed at the MCG in the pre-game show at the 2019 AFL Grand Final Day.\nOn 5 February 2020, Kelly released a single titled, \"Sleep, Australia, Sleep\". The song addresses Australia's response to climate change. Before the release of the single, the lyrics were published by The Sydney Morning Herald, with Kelly describing the song as \"a lament in the form of a lullaby. Paradoxically, it can also be heard as a wake up call - a critique of the widespread attitude amongst humans that we are the most important life form on the planet.\"\nIn September 2021, Kelly released a song inspired by Australian Rules footballer Eddie Betts and his battle with racism, titled \"Every Step of the Way\". On 19 November 2021, Kelly released his twenty-eighth studio album, \"Paul Kelly's Christmas Train\".\nIn July 2023, Kelly released a book and song titled, \"Khawaja\", inspired by Usman Khawaja.\nIn November 2023, Kelly was inducted into the South Australian Music Awards Hall of Fame.\nIn 2024, Kelly released \"Fever Longing Still\", his twenty-ninth studio album. The album's title is lifted from William Shakespeare's Sonnet 147. Upon announcement on 1 August 2024, Kelly said \"There has been a long gap since the last album of new songs and I realise now that this record is a bit like \"Gossip\", an album with a long gestation where the songs are all quite different to each other in style.\"\nIn December 2024, a film adaptation of Kelly's song \"How to Make Gravy\" was released under the same name. The film expands the storyline and characters of the original song, and was produced on the Gold Coast, Queensland. Kelly made a cameo appearance in the film as a bus driver.\nIn August 2025, Kelly announced a new album titled \"Seventy\" and released a single from the album titled \"Rita Wrote a Letter\". This song continues the story of \"How to Make Gravy\", set many years later. He also announced a tour that will begin in the same month. Shortly before the single's release, Kelly took out a death notice for the character Joe in \"How to Make Gravy\". The music video for \"Rita Wrote a Letter\" starred Australian actress Justine Clarke as Rita and Kelly himself as the ghost of deceased Joe.\nMusical style and songwriting.\nPaul Kelly has been acknowledged as one of Australia's best singer-songwriters. His music style has ranged from bluegrass to studio-oriented dub reggae, but his core output comfortably straddles folk, rock, and country. His lyrics capture Australia's vastness both in culture and landscape; he has chronicled life about him for over 30 years and is described as the poet laureate of Australia. According to music writer Glenn A. Baker, his Australian-ness may be a reason Kelly has not achieved international success. David Fricke from \"Rolling Stone\" calls Kelly \"one of the finest songwriters I have ever heard, Australian or otherwise.\"\nFellow songwriter Neil Finn (Crowded House) has said, \"There is something unique and powerful about the way Kelly mixes up everyday detail with the big issues of life, death, love and struggle \u2013 not a trace of pretence or fakery in there\". Ross Clelland, writing for \"Rolling Stone\", described Kelly: \"[W]hile he was (rightly) lauded for his ability to sing of injustice without ranting, or deal with the darker sides of human nature non-judgementally, often overlooked was the fact he could write a damn fine melodic hook to go with those words\". Tim Freedman (The Whitlams) acknowledges Kelly, Peter Garrett (Midnight Oil), and John Schumann (Redgum) as inspiring him by \"[furnishing] our suburbs with our own myths and social history\". However, Kelly has been quoted as saying \"Song writing is mysterious to me. I still feel like a total beginner. I don't feel like I have got it nailed yet\". In 2007 Kelly donated his 'Lee Oskar' harmonica to the Sydney Powerhouse Museum. The museum's statement of significance cites Kelly's talent as a songwriter, his distinctive voice, and his harmonica playing, particularly on \"Live, May 1992\".\nKelly described his songwriting as \"a scavenging art, a desperate act. For me it's a bit from here, a bit from there, fumbling around, never quite knowing what you're doing ... Song writing is like a way of feeling connected to mystery.\" He has resisted the label of 'storyteller' and insists that his songs are not strictly autobiographical; \"they come from imagining someone in a particular situation. Sometimes a sequence of events happens which makes it more a story, but other times it's just that situation\". Sometimes the same character is found in different songs, such as in \"To Her Door\", \"Love Never Runs on Time\", and \"How to Make Gravy\".\nKelly has also provided songs for many other artists, tailoring them to their particular vocal range. \"Women at the Well\" (2002) had 14 female artists record his songs in tribute. According to Kelly, he adapted his song \"Foggy Highway\" for Ren\u00e9e Geyer because \"I admired her deep soul singing, ferocious and vulnerable ... When I heard the finished version ... the hairs rose up on the back of my neck.\" Kelly and The Stormwater Boys recorded it in a bluegrass style as the title track for the 2005 album \"Foggy Highway\". Divinyls' lead singer Christina Amphlett recorded \"Before Too Long\"\u2014she was attracted by the lyrics\u2014she interpreted the song's narrator as being a stalker, and provided a female perspective in a darkly menacing manner \u00e0-la \"Fatal Attraction\".\nKelly has written songs with and for numerous artists, including Mick Thomas, Geyer, Kate Ceberano, Vika and Linda Bull, Nick Cave, Nick Barker, Kasey Chambers, Yothu Yindi, Archie Roach, Gyan, Monique Brumby, Kelly Willis, Missy Higgins, and Troy Cassar-Daley. He has described how some songs he writes are suited to other vocal ranges. \"Quite often, I'm trying to write a certain kind of song and it's more ambitious than what my voice will get to. That's how I started writing songs with other people in mind\". Kelly and Carmody's \"From Little Things Big Things Grow\" was analysed by Sydney University's Linguistics professor James R Martin. \"[They] render the story as a narrative ... with the familiar Orientation, Complication, Evaluation, Resolution and Coda staging\". Martin finds that Kelly and Carmody made the point that when people exert their rights with support from friends, they may defeat those with prestige.\nKelly understands that co-writing with other songwriters lends power to his songs. \"You often write songs with collaborators that you would never write by yourself. It's a way of dragging a song out of you that you wouldn't have come up with\". One of his collaborators, Linda Bull, described Kelly's process: they would start with a simple chat. \"We'd just chuck ideas around and he'd pick the best bits. He'd take all the bluntness and crudeness out of it and make it beautiful; that's his magic ... It's conversations that you have everyday [\"sic\"]\". Forster summarised his 2009 review of Kelly's compilation, \"Songs from the South\", with \"[his songs] sound easy and approachable ... Then you think: If the songs are so simple and the ideas behind them so clear, why aren't more people writing like Paul Kelly and sounding as good as he does?\" In 2010 Carmody and Kelly's \"From Little Things Big Things Grow\" was added to the National Film and Sound Archive's Sounds of Australia Registry.\nPersonal life.\nKelly's first marriage (1980\u201384) was to Hilary Brown; the couple had a son, Declan, who later worked as a radio presenter on 3RRR's \"Against the Arctic\" from 2006. As of 2007, he was a DJ around Melbourne and played the drums. For \"Paul Kelly: Stories of Me\", Declan recalled his feelings whenever he hears \"When I First Met Your Ma\", which describes Kelly's courtship of Hilary Brown. Brown remembered \"songs written especially for and about her\" but also about other women, she quipped \"There are too many girls out there! One for every song!\"\nKelly's second marriage (1993\u20132001) was to actress Kaarin Fairfax. \"The Monthly\"'s Richard Guilliatt travelled with Kelly, his band and \"his new love and future wife, the diminutive\" Fairfax on a section of the group's US tour prior to the release of \"Under the Sun\". The couple have two daughters, Madeleine and Memphis. From 1989 to 1992, Fairfax supplied backing vocals on tracks by Paul Kelly and the Messengers. In 1990, as Mary-Jo Starr, a country music artist, Fairfax released three singles and an album called \"Too Many Movies\". Memphis Kelly starred alongside her parents in the Rachel Perkins short film \"One Night the Moon\" (2001) for which Paul Kelly composed the score. After the couple separated in 2001, Madeleine and Memphis stayed with Fairfax, but Kelly maintained contact with his daughters. In 2010, Madeleine and Memphis formed a pop indie trio, Wishful, with Sam Humphrey; they were later joined by Harley Hamer and Caleb Williams. In March 2014, Wishful performed at the Port Fairy Folk Festival. Since 2020, Memphis has pursued a solo career under the moniker of Memphis LK, releasing her debut EP \"Too Much Fun\" in 2023 and its follow-up \"Say\" in 2024.\nKelly was in a relationship with Sian Prior, a journalist, university lecturer and opera singer, from 2002 to 2011. They met when Kelly was interviewed on her \"Sunday Arts\" ABC radio program. Kelly wrote \"You're 39, You're Beautiful and You're Mine\" for Prior who was already 40 by the time he finished. Prior has played clarinet and provided backing vocals on some of Kelly's songs, as well as with the Stardust Five. She has performed live with Kelly on several occasions, including clarinet on six tracks of his \"A \u2013 Z Recordings\" boxed set.\nIn his memoir, Kelly credited Prior with inspiring him to give up his long-term heroin addiction, \"I got lucky, I met a woman who said: 'It's me or it'. She gave me the number of a counsellor ... I thought about 'it' every day for a long time. Less now\". The couple had separated during the making of Kelly's biopic, however the separation is not mentioned and Prior is not interviewed in the film. According to Prior after a date in 2011, \"[we] came home. He sat on the bed. 'I've decided I want to be single again,' he told her. 'Yes, I have been with other women.'\" The split occurred after she had filmed her interview and \"after the breakup, [she] requested the footage not be used. Her presence in Kelly's life is as a footnote in the credits. It's as if she was never there.\"\nSi\u00e2n Darling became Kelly's partner. They met in 2014 performing in a theatre show called \"Funeral\". The couple continue to live and work together from their St Kilda base. Darling is an artist, activist, curator and producer and has been working on Kelly's professional management team since 2018. Her influence on Kelly's work is noted in the Stuart Coupe biography. Darling is the subject of several songs and has produced and directed some of Kelly's music videos: \"With the One I Love\", \"Sleep Australia Sleep\" and \"When We're Both Old and Mad\". Darling produced the 2020 re-issue version of Carmody's album \"Cannot Buy My Soul\".\nKelly's brother, Martin, is the father of Dan Kelly, a singer-guitarist. Dan has performed with his uncle on several of Kelly's albums, including \"Ways and Means\", as a member of Paul Kelly and the Boon Companions, and on \"Stolen Apples\". Dan and Paul were both members of Stardust Five, which released \"Stardust Five\".\nPaul Kelly's younger sister, Mary Jo Kelly, is a Melbourne-based pianist who performed with him on the track \"South of Germany\" for \"Paul Kelly Live at the Athenaeum, May 1992\" (1992). She has performed in Latin bands and worked as a music teacher at the Victorian College of the Arts Secondary School. Mary Jo provided piano on Archie Roach's album \"Charcoal Lane\" (1990), which was produced by Kelly and Connolly.\nAwards and recognition.\nPaul Kelly has won several awards, including 17 ARIA Awards from the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), and five APRA Awards from either the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) alone or together with the Australian Guild of Screen Composers. APRA named \"To Her Door\", solely written by Kelly, and \"Treaty\", written by Kelly and members of Yothu Yindi, in their Top 30 best Australian songs of all time in 2001. Kelly was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 1997, alongside the Bee Gees and Graeme Bell. He has won six Country Music Awards from the Country Music Association of Australia, and four Mo Awards (Australian entertainment industry). Kelly was a Victorian State Finalist for the 2012 Australian of the Year Award. Kelly was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2017 for distinguished service to the performing arts and to the promotion of the national identity through contributions as a singer, songwriter and musician.\nIn August 2022, the City of Adelaide renamed a laneway in the city centre off Flinders Street Paul Kelly Lane. Previously named Pilgrim Lane after the adjacent Pilgrim Uniting Church, the lane is now called Paul Kelly Lane. It is the fourth such renaming after musicians associated with the city, the others being Sia Furler, No Fixed Address, and Cold Chisel.\nBibliography.\nPaul Kelly has written, co-written or edited the following:\nDiscography.\n Studio albums\nFilms.\n\"\" (1 October 2012) is an Australian documentary by Shark Island Productions.

He has worked in a variety of roles, principally for \"The Australian\" newspaper and is currently its editor-at-large. Kelly also appears as a commentator on Sky News Australia and has written seven books on political events in Australia since the 1970s including on the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis. Recent works include \"The March of Patriots\", which chronicles the creation of a modern Australia during the 1991\u20132007 era of prime ministers, Paul Keating and John Howard, and \"Triumph &amp; Demise\" which focuses on the leadership tensions at the heart of the Rudd\u2013Gillard Labor governments of 2007 to 2011. Kelly presented the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) TV documentary series \"100 Years \u2013 The Australian Story\" (2001) and wrote a book of the same title.\nIn 2006, Kelly's work was described by fellow Australian journalists Toby Creswell and Samantha Trenoweth as being \"distinguished for his broad and deep grasp of the inter-relationship of economics and political shifts, and his ability to place Australian domestic developments into an international and historical context\".\nLife and career.\nPaul John Kelly was born on 11 October 1947 in Sydney, New South Wales. He is the son of Joseph Kelly and Sybil (n\u00e9e Mackenzie). He completed a Bachelor of Arts degree and Diploma of Education at the University of Sydney in 1969. He worked in the Prime Minister's Department in Canberra from 1969 to 1971 before changing to journalism. He is a Doctor of Letters from the University of Melbourne.\nHe joined the Canberra Press Gallery in 1971 and became chief political correspondent for \"The Australian\" from 1974 to 1975.

It was instrumental in popularizing the World Wide Web and the general Internet during the 1990s by integrating multimedia such as text and graphics. Although not the first web browser (preceded by WorldWideWeb, Erwise, and ViolaWWW), it was the first browser to display images inline with text instead of a separate window.\nIt supported various Internet protocols such as HTTP, FTP, NNTP, and Gopher. Its interface, reliability, personal computer support, and simple installation contributed to Mosaic's initial popularity.\nMosaic was developed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign beginning in late 1992, released in January 1993, with official development and support until January 1997. Mosaic lost market share to Netscape Navigator in late 1994, and had only a tiny fraction of users left by 1997, when the project was discontinued. Microsoft licensed one of the derivative commercial products, Spyglass Mosaic, to create Internet Explorer in 1995.\nHistory.\nIn 1991, the High Performance Computing Act of 1991 was passed, which provided funding for new projects at the NCSA, where, after trying ViolaWWW, David Thompson demonstrated it to the NCSA software design group. This inspired Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina \u2013 two programmers working at NCSA \u2013 to create Mosaic. Andreessen and Bina began developing Mosaic in February 1991 for Unix's X Window System, calling it \"xmosaic\". Marc Andreessen announced the project's first release, the \"alpha/beta version 0.5,\" on January 23, 1993. Version 1.0 was released on April 21, 1993. Ports to Microsoft Windows and Macintosh were released in September. A port of Mosaic to the Amiga was available by October 1993. NCSA Mosaic for Unix (X Window System) version 2.0 was released on November 10, 1993 and was notable for adding support for forms, thus enabling the creation of the first dynamic web pages. From 1994 to 1997, the National Science Foundation supported the further development of Mosaic.\nMarc Andreessen, the leader of the team that developed Mosaic, left NCSA and, with James H. Clark, one of the founders of Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI), and four other former students and staff of the University of Illinois, started Mosaic Communications Corporation. Mosaic Communications eventually became Netscape Communications Corporation, producing Netscape Navigator. Mosaic's popularity as a separate browser began to decrease after the 1994 release of Netscape Navigator, the relevance of which was noted in \"The HTML Sourcebook: The Complete Guide to HTML\": \"Netscape Communications has designed an all-new WWW browser, Netscape, that has significant enhancements over the original Mosaic program.\"\nIn 1994, SCO released Global Access, a modified version of SCO's Open Desktop Unix, which became the first commercial product to incorporate Mosaic. However, by 1998, the Mosaic user base had almost completely evaporated as users moved to other web browsers.\nLicensing.\nThe licensing terms for NCSA Mosaic were generous for a proprietary software program. In general, non-commercial use was free of charge for all versions (with certain limitations). Additionally, the X Window System/Unix version publicly provided source code (source code for the other versions was available after agreements were signed). Despite persistent rumors to the contrary, however, Mosaic was never released as open source software during its brief reign as a major browser; there were always constraints on permissible uses without payment.\nAs of 1993[ [update]], license holders included these:\nFeatures.\nRobert Reid notes that Andreessen's team hoped:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... to rectify many of the shortcomings of the very primitive prototypes then floating around the Internet. Most significantly, their work transformed the appeal of the Web from niche uses in the technical area to mass-market appeal. In particular, these University of Illinois students made two key changes to the Web browser, which hyper-boosted its appeal: they added graphics to what was otherwise boring text-based software, and, most importantly, they ported the software from so-called Unix computers that are popular only in technical and academic circles, to the [Microsoft] Windows operating system, which is used on more than 80 percent of the computers in the world, especially personal and commercial computers.\nMosaic is based on the libwww library and thus supported a wide variety of Internet protocols included in the library: Archie, FTP, gopher, HTTP, NNTP, telnet, WAIS.\nMosaic is not the first web browser for Microsoft Windows; this is Thomas R. Bruce's little-known Cello. The Unix version of Mosaic was already famous before the Microsoft Windows, Amiga, and Mac versions were released. Other than displaying images embedded in the text (rather than in a separate window), Mosaic's original feature set is similar to the browsers on which it was modeled, such as ViolaWWW. But Mosaic was the first browser written and supported by a team of full-time programmers, was reliable and easy enough for novices to install, and the inline graphics proved immensely appealing. Mosaic is said to have made the Internet accessible to the ordinary person.\nMosaic was the first browser to explore the concept of collaborative annotation in 1993 but never passed the test state.\nMosaic was the first browser that could submit forms to a server.\nImpact.\nMosaic led to the Internet boom of the 1990s. Other browsers existed during this period, such as Erwise, ViolaWWW, MidasWWW, and tkWWW, but did not have the same effect as Mosaic on public use of the Internet.\nIn the October 1994 issue of \"Wired\" magazine, Gary Wolfe notes in the article titled \"The (Second Phase of the) Revolution Has Begun: Don't look now, but Prodigy, AOL, and CompuServe are all suddenly obsolete \u2013 and Mosaic is well on its way to becoming the world's standard interface\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When it comes to smashing a paradigm, pleasure is not the most important thing. It is the only thing. If this sounds wrong, consider Mosaic. Mosaic is the celebrated graphical \"browser\" that allows users to travel through the world of electronic information using a point-and-click interface. Mosaic's charming appearance encourages users to load their own documents onto the Net, including color photos, sound bites, video clips, and hypertext \"links\" to other documents. By following the links \u2013 click, and the linked document appears \u2013 you can travel through the online world along paths of whim and intuition. Mosaic is not the most direct way to find online information. Nor is it the most powerful. It is merely the most pleasurable way, and in the 18 months since it was released, Mosaic has incited a rush of excitement and commercial energy unprecedented in the history of the Net.\nReid also refers to Matthew K. Gray's website, https://, which indicates a dramatic leap in web use around the time of Mosaic's introduction.\nDavid Hudson concurs with Reid:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Marc Andreessen's realization of Mosaic, based on the work of Berners-Lee and the hypertext theorists before him, is generally recognized as the beginning of the web as it is now known. Mosaic, the first web browser to win over the masses, was released in 1993 and made freely accessible to the public. The adjective phenomenal, so often overused in this industry, is genuinely applicable to the... 'explosion' in the growth of the web after Mosaic appeared on the scene. Starting with next to nothing, the rates of the web growth (quoted in the press) hovering around tens of thousands of percent over ridiculously short periods of time were no real surprise.\nUltimately, web browsers such as Mosaic became the \"killer applications\" of the 1990s. Web browsers were the first to bring a graphical interface to search tools, the Internet's burgeoning wealth of distributed information services. A mid-1994 guide lists Mosaic alongside the traditional, text-oriented information search tools of the time, Archie and Veronica, Gopher, and WAIS but Mosaic quickly subsumed and displaced them all. Joseph Hardin, the director of the NCSA group within which Mosaic was developed, said downloads were up to 50,000 a month in mid-1994.\nIn November 1992, there were twenty-six websites in the world and each one attracted attention. In its release year of 1993, Mosaic had a What's New page, and about one new link was being added per day. This was a time when access to the Internet was expanding rapidly outside its previous domain of academia and large industrial research institutions. Yet it was the availability of Mosaic and Mosaic-derived graphical browsers themselves that drove the explosive growth of the Web to over 10,000 sites by August 1995 and millions by 1998. Metcalfe expressed the pivotal role of Mosaic this way:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn the Web's first generation, Tim Berners-Lee launched the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and HTML standards with prototype Unix-based servers and browsers. A few people noticed that the Web might be better than Gopher.\nIn the second generation, Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina developed NCSA Mosaic at the University of Illinois. Several million then suddenly noticed that the Web might be better than sex.\nIn the third generation, Andreessen and Bina left NCSA to found Netscape...\nLegacy.\nNetscape Navigator was later developed by Netscape, which employed many of the original Mosaic authors; however, it intentionally shared no code with Mosaic. Netscape Navigator's code descendant is Mozilla Firefox.\nSpyglass, Inc. licensed the technology and trademarks from NCSA for producing its own web browser but never used any of the NCSA Mosaic source code. Microsoft licensed Spyglass Mosaic in 1995 for US$2 million, modified it, and renamed it Internet Explorer. After a later auditing dispute, Microsoft paid Spyglass $8 million. The 1995 user guide \"The HTML Sourcebook: The Complete Guide to HTML\", specifically states, in a section called \"Coming Attractions\", that Internet Explorer \"will be based on the Mosaic program\". Versions of Internet Explorer before version 7 stated \"Based on NCSA Mosaic\" in the About box. Internet Explorer 7 was audited by Microsoft to ensure that it contained no Spyglass Mosaic code, and thus no longer credits Spyglass or Mosaic.\nAfter NCSA stopped work on Mosaic, development of the NCSA Mosaic for the X Window System source code was continued by several independent groups. These independent development efforts include mMosaic (multicast Mosaic), which ceased development in early 2004, and Mosaic-CK and VMS Mosaic.\nVMS Mosaic, a version specifically targeting OpenVMS operating system, is one of the longest-lived efforts to maintain Mosaic. Using the VMS support already built-in in the original version (Bjorn S. Nilsson ported Mosaic 1.2 to VMS in the summer of 1993), developers incorporated a substantial part of the HTML engine from mMosaic, another defunct flavor of the browser. As of the most recent version (4.2), released in 2007, VMS Mosaic supported HTML 4.0, OpenSSL, cookies, and various image formats including GIF, JPEG, PNG, BMP, TGA, TIFF and JPEG 2000 image formats. The browser works on VAX, Alpha, and Itanium platforms.\nAnother long-lived version, Mosaic-CK, developed by Cameron Kaiser, was last released (version 2.7ck9) on July 11, 2010; a maintenance release with minor compatibility fixes (version 2.7ck10) was released on January 9, 2015, followed by another one (2.7ck11) in October 2015. The stated goal of the project is \"Lynx with graphics\" and runs on Mac OS X, Power MachTen, Linux and other compatible Unix-like OSs.\nRelease history.\nThe X, Windows, and Mac versions of Mosaic all had separate development teams and code bases.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is considered one of the greatest painters of the Dutch Golden Age. During his lifetime, he was a moderately successful provincial genre painter, recognized in Delft and The Hague. He produced relatively few paintings, primarily earning his living as an art dealer. He was not wealthy; at his death, his wife was left in debt.\nVermeer worked slowly and with great care, and frequently used very expensive pigments. He is particularly renowned for making masterful use of light in his work. \"Almost all his paintings\", Hans Koningsberger wrote, \"are apparently set in two smallish rooms in his house in Delft; they show the same furniture and decorations in various arrangements and they often portray the same people, mostly women.\"\nThe modest celebrity he enjoyed during his life gave way to obscurity after his death. He was barely mentioned in Arnold Houbraken's major source book on 17th-century Dutch painting (\"Grand Theatre of Dutch Painters and Women Artists\", published 1718) and, as a result, was omitted from subsequent surveys of Dutch art for nearly two centuries. In the 19th century, Vermeer was rediscovered by Gustav Friedrich Waagen and Th\u00e9ophile Thor\u00e9-B\u00fcrger, who published an essay attributing 66 works to him, although only 34 paintings are universally attributed to him today. Since that time, Vermeer's reputation has grown enormously.\nPronunciation of name.\nIn Dutch, \"Vermeer\" is pronounced , and \"Johannes Vermeer\" as , with assimilating to the preceding voiceless as . The usual English pronunciation is , with , with a long first vowel, occurring in the UK. is also documented. Another pronunciation, , is attested from the UK.\nLife.\nRelatively little was known about Vermeer's life until recently. He seems to have been devoted exclusively to his art, living out his life in the city of Delft. Until the 19th century, the only sources of information were a few registers, official documents, and comments by other artists; for this reason, Thor\u00e9-B\u00fcrger named him \"The Sphinx of Delft\". John Michael Montias added details on the family from the city archives of Delft in his \"Artists and Artisans in Delft: A Socio-Economic Study of the Seventeenth Century\" (1982).\nYouth and heritage.\nJohannes Vermeer was baptized within the Reformed Church on 31 October 1632. His mother, Digna Baltens (c.\u20091596\u20131670), was from Antwerp. Digna's father, Balthasar Geerts, or Gerrits (born in Antwerp in or around 1573), led an enterprising life in metalworking, and was arrested for counterfeiting. Vermeer's father, named Reijnier Janszoon, was a middle-class worker of silk or caffa (a mixture of silk and cotton or wool). He was the son of Jan Reyersz and Cornelia (Neeltge) Goris. As an apprentice in Amsterdam, Reijnier lived on fashionable Sint Antoniesbreestraat, a street with many resident painters at the time. In 1615, Reijnier married Digna. The couple moved to Delft and had a daughter named Gertruy who was baptized in 1620. In 1625, Reijnier was involved in a fight with a soldier named Willem van Bylandt who died from his wounds five months later. Around this time, Reijnier began dealing in paintings. In 1631, he leased an inn, which he called \"The Flying Fox\". In 1635, he lived on Voldersgracht 25 or 26. In 1641, he bought a larger inn on the market square, named after the Flemish town \"Mechelen\". The acquisition of the inn constituted a considerable financial burden. When Reijnier died in October 1652, Vermeer took over the operation of the family's art business.\nMarriage and family.\nIn April 1653, Johannes Reijniersz Vermeer married a Catholic woman, Catharina Bolnes (Bolenes). The blessing took place in the quiet nearby village of Schipluiden. Vermeer's new mother-in-law, Maria Thins, was initially opposed to the marriage as she was significantly wealthier than he, and it was probably she who insisted that Vermeer convert to Catholicism before the marriage on 5 April. The fact that Vermeer's father was in considerable debt also did not help in discussions on the marriage. Leonaert Bramer, who was Catholic himself, put in a good word for Vermeer and it was this that led Maria to drop her oppositions. According to art historian Walter Liedtke, Vermeer's conversion seems to have been made with conviction. His painting \"The Allegory of Faith\", made between 1670 and 1672, placed less emphasis on the artists' usual naturalistic concerns and more on symbolic religious applications, including the sacrament of the Eucharist. Walter Liedtke, in \"Dutch Paintings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art\", suggests that it was made for a learned and devout Catholic patron, perhaps for his \"schuilkerk\", or \"hidden church\". At some point, the couple moved in with Catharina's mother, who lived in a rather spacious house at Oude Langendijk, almost next to a hidden Jesuit church. There Vermeer lived for the rest of his life, producing paintings in the front room on the second floor. His wife gave birth to 15 children, four of whom were buried before being baptized but were registered as \"child of Johan Vermeer\". The names of 10 of Vermeer's children are known from wills written by relatives: Maertge, Elisabeth, Cornelia, Aleydis, Beatrix, Johannes, Gertruyd, Franciscus, Catharina, and Ignatius. Most of these names are those of saints; the youngest (Ignatius) was likely named after the Ignatius of Loyola.\nCareer.\nIt is unclear where and with whom Vermeer apprenticed as a painter. There is some speculation that Carel Fabritius may have been his teacher, based upon a controversial interpretation of a text written in 1668 by printer Arnold Bon. Art historians have found no hard evidence to support this. Local authority Leonaert Bramer acted as a friend, but his style of painting is rather different from Vermeer's. Liedtke suggests that Vermeer taught himself using information from one of his father's connections. Some scholars think that Vermeer was trained under Catholic painter Abraham Bloemaert. Vermeer's style is similar to that of some of the Utrecht Caravaggists, whose works are depicted as paintings-within-paintings in the backgrounds of several of his compositions.\nOn 29 December 1653, Vermeer became a member of the Guild of Saint Luke, a trade association for painters. The guild's records make clear that Vermeer did not pay the usual admission fee. It was a year of plague, war, and economic crisis; Vermeer was not alone in experiencing difficult financial circumstances. In 1654, a terrible explosion, known as the Delft Thunderclap, occurred at a gunpowder store and destroyed a large section of the city. Pieter van Ruijven and his wife, Maria de Knuijt, were Vermeer's patrons for the better part of the artist's career. In 2023, Maria de Knuijt was identified by the curators of the 2023 exhibition of Vermeer's works at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam as the main patron because of her long-standing and supportive relationship with the artist. It seems that Vermeer turned for inspiration to the art of the fijnschilders from Leiden. Vermeer was responding to the market of Gerard Dou's paintings, who sold his paintings for exorbitant prices. Dou may have influenced Pieter de Hooch and Gabriel Metsu too. Vermeer also charged higher than average prices for his work, most of which were purchased by an unknown collector.\nThe influence of Johannes Vermeer on Metsu is unmistakable: the light from the left, the marble floor. (Adriaan Waiboer, however, suggests that Metsu requires more emotional involvement of the viewer.) Vermeer probably competed also with Nicolaes Maes, who produced genre works in a similar style. In 1662, Vermeer was elected head of the guild and was reelected in 1663, 1670, and 1671, evidence that he (like Bramer) was considered an established craftsman among his peers. Vermeer worked slowly, probably producing three paintings a year on order. Balthasar de Monconys visited him in 1663 to see some of his work, but Vermeer had no paintings to show. The diplomat and the two French clergymen who accompanied him were sent to Hendrick van Buyten, a baker who had a couple of Vermeer's paintings as collateral.\nIn 1671, Gerrit van Uylenburgh organized the auction of Gerrit Reynst's collection and offered 13 paintings and some sculptures to Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg. Frederick accused them of being counterfeits and sent 12 back on the advice of Hendrick Fromantiou. Van Uylenburg then organized a counter-assessment, asking a total of 35 painters to pronounce on their authenticity, including Jan Lievens, Melchior de Hondecoeter, Gerbrand van den Eeckhout, and Johannes Vermeer.\nWars and death.\nIn 1672, a severe economic downturn known as the Rampjaar struck the Dutch Republic, after French troops led by Louis XIV invaded the country from the south during the Franco-Dutch War. At the same time, troops from M\u00fcnster and Cologne invaded the country from the east, causing more destruction. Many people panicked; courts, theaters, shops and schools were closed. Vermeer's sale of that year was his last. Five years passed before circumstances improved. In 1674, Vermeer was listed as a member of the civic guards. In the summer of 1675, Vermeer borrowed 1,000 guilders in Amsterdam from Jacob Romboutsz (grandfather of Hendrick Sorgh), an Amsterdam silk trader, using his mother-in-law's property as a surety.\nOn 15 December 1675, Vermeer died after a short illness. He was 43 years old. He was buried in the Protestant Old Church on 15 December 1675. In a petition to her creditors, Catharina Bolnes attributed her husband's death to the stress of financial pressures, and described his death as follows: \n... during the ruinous war with France he not only was unable to sell any of his art but also, to his great detriment, was left sitting with the paintings of other masters that he was dealing in. As a result and owing to the great burden of his children having no means of his own, he lapsed into such decay and decadence, which he had so taken to heart that, as if he had fallen into a frenzy, in a day and a half he went from being healthy to being dead.\nCatharina describes how the collapse of the art market had damaged Vermeer's business as both a painter and an art dealer. She had to raise 11 children and therefore asked the High Court to relieve her of debts owed to Vermeer's creditors. Pioneering Dutch microscopist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, who worked for the city council as a surveyor, was appointed trustee. The house had eight rooms on the first floor, the contents of which were listed in an inventory taken a few months after Vermeer's death. In his studio, there were two chairs, two painter's easels, three palettes, 10 canvases, a desk, an oak pull table, a small wooden cupboard with drawers, and \"rummage not worthy being itemized\". Nineteen of Vermeer's paintings were bequeathed to Catharina and her mother. The widow sold two more paintings to Hendrick van Buyten to pay off a substantial debt.\nVermeer had been a respected artist in Delft, but he was almost unknown outside his hometown. A local patron named Pieter van Ruijven had purchased much of his output, which kept Vermeer afloat financially but reduced the possibility of his fame spreading. Several factors contributed to his limited body of work. Vermeer never had any pupils, though one scholar has suggested that Vermeer taught his eldest daughter Maria to paint. Additionally, his family obligations with so many children may have taken up much of his time, as would acting as both an art dealer and inn-keeper in running the family businesses. His time spent serving as head of the guild and his extraordinary precision as a painter may have also limited his output.\nStyle.\nVermeer may have first executed his paintings tonally like most painters of his time, using either monochrome shades of grey (\"grisaille\") or a limited palette of browns and greys (\"dead coloring\"), over which he would apply more saturated colors (reds, yellows, and blues) in the form of transparent glazes. No drawings have been positively attributed to Vermeer, and his paintings offer few clues to preparatory methods.\nThere is no other 17th-century artist who employed the exorbitantly expensive pigment ultramarine (derived from natural lapis lazuli) either so lavishly or so early in his career. Vermeer used this pigment in not just elements that are naturally of this colour; he also used it early in a work, beneath subsequent earth colours such as umber and ochre, to subtly tint their shade. This working method most probably was inspired by Vermeer's understanding of Leonardo's observations that the surface of every object partakes of the colour of the adjacent object.\nAn example of Vermeer using ultramarine as an underpaint is in \"The Girl with the Wine Glass\". The shadows of the red satin dress are underpainted in natural ultramarine, and, owing to this underlying blue paint layer, the red lake and vermilion mixture applied over it acquires a slightly purple, cool and crisp appearance.\nEven after Vermeer's evident financial breakdown following the so-called rampjaar (year of disaster) in 1672, he continued to employ natural ultramarine generously, such as in \"Lady Seated at a Virginal\". This could suggest that Vermeer was supplied with materials by a collector and would coincide with John Michael Montias' theory that Pieter van Ruijven was Vermeer's patron.\nVermeer's works are largely genre pieces and portraits, with the exception of two cityscapes and two allegories. His subjects offer a cross-section of seventeenth-century Dutch society, ranging from the portrayal of a simple milkmaid at work, to the luxury and splendour of rich notables and merchantmen in their roomy houses. Besides these subjects, religious, poetical, musical, and scientific comments can also be found in his work.\nPainting materials.\nOne aspect of his meticulous painting technique was Vermeer's choice of pigments. He is best known for his frequent use of the very expensive ultramarine (\"The Milkmaid\") and also lead-tin-yellow (\"A Lady Writing a Letter\"), madder lake (\"Christ in the House of Martha and Mary\"), and vermilion. He also painted with ochres, bone black and azurite. The claim that he used Indian yellow in \"Woman Holding a Balance\" has been disproven by pigment analysis.\nIn Vermeer's oeuvre, only about 20 pigments have been detected. Of these, seven principal pigments that Vermeer commonly employed are lead white, yellow ochre, vermilion, madder lake, green earth, raw umber, and ivory or bone black.\nTheories of mechanical aid.\nVermeer's painting techniques have long been a source of debate, given their almost photorealistic attention to detail, despite Vermeer's having had no formal training and despite only limited evidence that Vermeer had created any preparatory sketches or traces for his paintings.\nIn 2001, British artist David Hockney published the book \"Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters\", in which he argued that Vermeer (among other Renaissance and Baroque artists including Hans Holbein and Diego Vel\u00e1zquez) used optics to achieve precise positioning in their compositions, and specifically some combination of curved mirrors, camera obscura, and camera lucida. This became known as the Hockney\u2013Falco thesis, named after Hockney and Charles M. Falco, another proponent of the theory.\nPhilip Steadman published the book \"Vermeer's Camera: Uncovering the Truth behind the Masterpieces\" in 2001, in which Steadman specifically claimed that Vermeer had used a camera obscura to create his paintings. Steadman noted that many of Vermeer's paintings had been painted in the same room, and he found six of Vermeer's paintings that would be precisely the right size if they had been painted from inside a camera obscura in the room's back wall.\nSupporters of these theories have pointed to evidence in some of Vermeer's paintings, such as the often-discussed sparkling pearly highlights in Vermeer's paintings, which they argue are the result of the primitive lens of a camera obscura producing halation. It was also postulated that a camera obscura was the mechanical cause of the \"exaggerated\" perspective seen in \"The Music Lesson\" (London, Royal Collection).\nIn 2008, American entrepreneur and inventor Tim Jenison developed the theory that Vermeer had used a camera obscura along with a \"comparator mirror\", which is similar in concept to a camera lucida but much simpler and makes it easy to match colour values. Jenison later modified the theory to simply involve a concave mirror and a comparator mirror. He spent the next five years testing his theory by re-creating \"The Music Lesson\" himself using these tools, a process captured in the 2013 documentary film \"Tim's Vermeer\".\nSeveral points were brought out by Jenison in support of this technique. First was Vermeer's hyper-accurate rendition of light falloff along the wall. Neurobiologist Colin Blakemore, in an interview with Jenison, notes that human vision cannot process information about the absolute brightness of a scene. Another was the addition of several highlights and outlines consistent with matching the effects of chromatic aberration, particularly noticeable in primitive optics. Last, and perhaps most telling, is a noticeable curvature in the original painting's rendition of the scrollwork on the virginal. This effect matched Jenison's technique precisely, caused by exactly duplicating the view as seen from a curved mirror.\nThis theory remains disputed. While there is no historical evidence regarding Vermeer's interest in optics, Vermeer was in close connection with pioneer lens maker Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, who was his executor after death. The detailed inventory of the artist's belongings drawn up after his death includes no camera obscura, lens, nor similar device.\nWorks.\nIt is believed Vermeer produced a total of fewer than 50 paintings, of which 34 have survived. Only three Vermeer paintings were dated by the artist: \"The Procuress\" (1656; Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Dresden); \"The Astronomer\" (1668; Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris); and \"The Geographer\" (1669; St\u00e4delsches Kunstinstitut, Frankfurt).\nVermeer's mother-in-law, Maria Thins, owned Dirck van Baburen's 1622 oil on canvas \"The Procuress\" (or a copy of it), which appears in the background of two of Vermeer's paintings. The same subject was also painted by Vermeer. Almost all of Vermeer's paintings are of contemporary subjects in a smaller format, with a cooler palette dominated by blues, yellows, and grays.Vermeer painted multiple artworks portraying a pure profile like the painting \"Woman with a Pearl Necklace\", which was uncommon in Dutch art at the time. Practically all of his surviving works belong to this period, usually domestic interiors with one or two figures lit by a window on the left. They are characterized by a sense of compositional balance and spatial order, unified by a pearly light. Mundane domestic or recreational activities are imbued with a poetic timelessness (e.g., \"Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window\", Dresden, Gem\u00e4ldegalerie). Vermeer's two townscapes have also been attributed to this period: \"View of Delft\" (The Hague, Mauritshuis) and \"The Little Street\" (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum).\nA few of his paintings show a certain hardening of manner and are generally thought to represent his late works. From this period come \"The Allegory of Faith\" (c. 1670; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) and \"The Love Letter\" (c. 1670; Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam).\nLegacy.\nVermeer's works went mostly unnoticed by art historians during the two centuries following his death. Although select connoisseurs in the Netherlands did appreciate his work, many of his paintings were attributed to then better-known artists such as Metsu or Mieris. The modern revival of interest in Vermeer began in the 1860s, when German museum director Gustav Waagen recognized the hand of Vermeer in the Czernin gallery in Vienna, where \"The Art of Painting\" had been misattributed to Pieter de Hooch. Research by Th\u00e9ophile Thor\u00e9-B\u00fcrger culminated in the publication of his catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of Vermeer's works in the \"Gazette des Beaux-Arts\" in 1866. Thor\u00e9-B\u00fcrger's catalogue drew international attention to Vermeer, to whom more than 70 works were ascribed, including many that Thor\u00e9-B\u00fcrger regarded as uncertain. In the years following this rediscovery, several prominent Dutch artists, such as Simon Duiker, adopted Vermeer's style. Other artists who were inspired by Vermeer include Danish painter Wilhelm Hammershoi and American Thomas Wilmer Dewing. In the 20th century, Vermeer's admirers included Salvador Dal\u00ed, who painted his own version of \"The Lacemaker\" (on commission from collector Robert Lehman) and pitted large copies of the original against a rhinoceros in some surrealist experiments. Dali also celebrated the master in \"The Ghost of Vermeer of Delft Which Can Be Used As a Table\", 1934.\nHan van Meegeren was a 20th-century Dutch painter who worked in the classical tradition. He became a master forger, motivated by a blend of aesthetic and financial reasons, creating and selling many new \"Vermeers\" before turning himself in for forgery to avoid being charged with capital treason for collaboration with the Nazis, specifically in selling what had been believed to be original artwork to the Nazis.\nVermeer's \"The Concert\" was stolen during the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum theft in 1990 and remains unrecovered.\nOn the evening of 23 September 1971, a 21-year-old hotel waiter, Mario Pierre Roymans, stole Vermeer's \"Love Letter\" from the Fine Arts Palace in Brussels, where it was on loan from the Rijksmuseum for the exhibition \"Rembrandt and his Age\".\nTo mark the 26th anniversary of the opening of an exhibition at Washington, DC's National Gallery of Art featuring Vermeer's work, Google honored Vermeer with a Google Doodle on 12 November 2021.\nA 2023 exhibition at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam featured 28 of Vermeer's works, the most ever shown together. More than 650,000 people visited the exhibition, making it the museum's most visited exhibition. Coinciding with the exhibition, the documentary film \"Close to Vermeer\" was released the same year. The film followed curators Gregor J. M. Weber and Pieter Roelofs as they sought loans of Vermeer's artwork from museums around the world. Also released in 2023 was another movie about the exhibition at the Rijkmuseum: \"Vermeer: The Greatest Exhibition\". (External links to both movies are below.)\nIn popular culture.\nVermeer's name and works have been featured in both literature and in films. Tracy Chevalier's novel \"Girl with a Pearl Earring\" (1999) and the 2003 film of the same name present a fictional account of Vermeer's creation of the famous painting and his relationship with the equally fictional model.\nMany artists are inspired by the famous painter. For example, culinary photographer Aimee Twigger draws on Vermeer's chiaroscuro for her gustatory journeys through recipes.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "43312", "revid": "753665", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43312", "title": "Cimarron (novel)", "text": "1930 novel by Edna Ferber\nCimarron is a novel by Edna Ferber, published in April 1930 and based on development in Oklahoma after the Land Rush. The book was adapted into a critically acclaimed film of the same name, released in 1931 through RKO Pictures. The story was again adapted for the screen by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and was released in 1960, to meager success.\nBackground.\nThe Land Rush.\nThe Oklahoma Land Rush (also called the Oklahoma Land Race and Cherokee Strip Land Run) plays a pivotal role in both the novel and film adaptations. \"Manifest destiny\" and the desperation of the settlers involved in the rush provides the opening drama and sets the stage for the twists and turns in the book. Every settler is desperate to stake his claim on the best piece of land (near water).\n\"Cimarron\" involves two land runs. The first, for the Unassigned Lands, occurred on April 22, 1889. The second, for the Cherokee Outlet (commonly called the Cherokee Strip) occurred in 1893. The piece of land in question had been allotted to the Cherokee Nation as part of the 1828 Treaty of New Echota, while the rest of the Oklahoma Territory had been opened to settlers. As commerce grew across the area of Kansas and Oklahoma, cattlemen became increasingly annoyed by the presence of the Cherokee on prime land that they wanted to use to drive cattle from northern ranches to Texas. Some of this annoyance with the Native people can be attributed to the decision made by the Cherokees to side with the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. In the 1880s, the government attempted to lease the land for cattle ranching, but the Native Americans refused. Eventually, the Cherokee people did sell the land to the government.\nThroughout the remaining years of the 1880s various cattle associations and ranches fought over the land. Disputes even turned deadly, as large cattle companies and small ranchers both claimed the land as their own. This eventually led to a ban on cattle ranching in the area, and in 1893 the land, 58 miles (93\u00a0km) wide by 225 miles (362\u00a0km) long, was opened to homesteaders. The land was divided into 42,000 claims, and each homesteader had to literally stake (put a stake with a white flag attached) their claim, and pick up a certificate back at the starting place. Nearly 100,000 people arrived for the rush, and over half of them would be sent back home after the day was through.\nNovel.\n\"Cimarron\" derives its name from the Cimarron Territory. The Cimarron Territory was an unrecognized name for the No Man's Land, an unsettled area of the West and Midwest, especially lands once inhabited by Native American tribes such as the Cherokee and Sioux. In 1886 the government declared such lands open to settlement. At the time of the novel's opening, Oklahoma is one such \"Cimarron Territory,\" though in actuality the historical setting of the novel is somewhere in the Cherokee Outlet, also known as the Cherokee Strip, and probably the city of Guthrie, Oklahoma.\nThe novel is set in the Oklahoma of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It follows the lives of Yancey and Sabra Cravat, beginning with Yancey's tale of his participation in the 1893 land rush. They emigrate from Wichita, Kansas, to the fictional town of Osage, Oklahoma with their son Cim and\u2014unknowingly\u2014a black boy named Isaiah. In Osage, the Cravats print their newspaper, the \"Oklahoma Wigwam\", and build their fortune amongst Indian disputes, outlaws, and the discovery of oil in Oklahoma.\nUpon its publication, \"Cimarron\" was a sensation in America and came to epitomize an era in American history. It was the best selling novel of 1930, as it provided readers an outlet to escape their present suffering in the Great Depression. This novel became Ferber's third successful novel and paved the way for many more Ferber-penned historical epics, and it was published as an Armed Services Edition during WWII.\nWhile it became seen as a triumphant feminist story detailing Sabra Cravat's growth from a traditional American housewife into a successful leader and politician, Ferber has stated in her autobiography, \"A Peculiar Treasure\", that the novel was originally intended as a satirical criticism of American womanhood and American sentimentality. Throughout the novel, Sabra's practice of imperial domesticity can be seen in her attempts to \"civilize\" Native Americans by forcing them to adopt white values, and her fixation on expanding her own sphere of influence, which as a woman, was traditionally her home.\nThe character of Yancey Cravat is based on Temple Lea Houston, last child of Texas icon Sam Houston. Temple Houston was a brilliant trial lawyer known for his flamboyant courtroom theatrics. He was also a competent gunfighter who killed at least one man in a stand-up shootout.\nFilms.\n1931 film.\nHollywood had long since taken notice of writer Edna Ferber's talents. The first Ferber adaptation came in 1918 with the silent \"Our Mrs. McChesney\", based on a play Ferber had written. \"So Big\" was released as a film the same year it was published as a novel, and adaptations of \"Gigolo\" and \"Show Boat\" also followed. With the advent of sound, Ferber adaptations had even more promise. Immediately following its publication, many production companies courted Ferber. Ferber ended up selling the film rights to RKO Pictures in 1930 for a record $125,000 (a large sum even for today).\nDespite America being in the depths of the Depression, RKO immediately prepared for a big-budget picture, investing more than $1.5 million into Ferber's novel \"Cimarron\". Director Wesley Ruggles would direct stars Richard Dix and Irene Dunne with a script written by Howard Estabrook. Filming began in the summer of 1930 at the Jasmin Quinn Ranch outside of Los Angeles, California. The film was a massive production, especially the land rush scenes, which recalled the epic scenes of \"Intolerance\" some fifteen years earlier. More than 5,000 extras, twenty-eight cameramen, and numerous camera assistants and photographers were used to capture scenes of wagons racing across grassy hills and prairies. Cinematographer Edward Cronjager spent overtime planning out every scene in accordance to Ferber's descriptions.\nThe film was premiered in New York City on January 26, 1931, to much praise, and a Los Angeles premiere followed on February 6. Three days later the film was released to theaters throughout the nation. Despite being a critical success, the high budget and ongoing Great Depression combined against the film. While it was a commercial success in line with other films of the day, RKO could not recoup their investment in the film.\n1960 film.\nThe remake of \"Cimarron\" included many changes from the Ferber novel and especially from the 1931 film. With the Civil Rights Movement gaining momentum, the script, written by Arnold Schulman, took a kinder approach to Native Americans. Schulman gave the people more dignity and recognized that they were losing land that was rightfully theirs through the 1893 land rush that was the film's centerpiece. He also introduced several minor characters, such as journalist Sam Pegler (Robert Keith) and Wes Jennings (Vic Morrow), a prominent member of Cherokee Kid's (Russ Tamblyn) gang.\nIn 1961 the film was nominated for two Academy Awards: Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Color (art directors George W. Davis and Addison Hehr) and Best Sound, but failed to win either. \"Cimarron\" marked the end of the Ferber adaptations."}

Both the leaked documents and the responses were published by open-source software advocate Eric S. Raymond in 1998.\nThe documents are associated with Halloween because many of them were originally leaked close to October 31 in different years.\nOverview.\nThe first Halloween document, requested by senior vice-president Jim Allchin for the attention of senior vice-president Paul Maritz and written by Microsoft program manager Vinod Valloppillil, was leaked to Eric Raymond in October 1998, who immediately published an annotated version on his web site. The document contained references to a second memorandum specifically dealing with Linux, and that document, authored by Vinod Valloppillil and Josh Cohen at Microsoft, was also obtained, annotated and published by Raymond. Microsoft later acknowledged the documents' authenticity. Marked \"Microsoft confidential\", the documents identified open-source software, and in particular the Linux operating system, as a major threat to Microsoft's domination of the software industry, and suggested tactics Microsoft could use to disrupt the progress of open-source software.\nThese documents acknowledged that free software products such as Linux were technologically competitive with some of Microsoft's products, and set out a strategy to combat them. These views contradicted Microsoft's public pronouncements on the subject.\nSince the publication of the two original documents, other Microsoft memoranda on related topics have also been leaked and published.\nList of documents.\nThe documents are from a variety of sources. Only some are leaked internal memos (documents I, II, VII, VIII, and X). One is a public statement (document III). The others are responses by Eric Raymond to various columns, news articles, and other works.\nDocuments I and II.\nThese are leaked reports for Microsoft's own use, both written by Vinod Valloppillil, a program manager at Microsoft.\nDocument I provides a detailed introduction to the concepts behind open source software and its possible impact on Microsoft products and services. It outlines the strengths and weaknesses of open source software. Document II describes the basic architecture of the Linux system, and its relation to Unix and Windows NT.\nDocument I revealed that \"FUD\" (spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt) was a traditional Microsoft marketing strategy, acknowledged and understood internally. Examples of Microsoft's FUD tactics are announcing nonexistent products or spreading rumors that competing products will crash Windows. Raymond suggests that the documents show that while Microsoft may have been dismissive of open source software in public, it privately considers it a serious competitor.\nIn discussing ways of competing with open source, Document I suggests that one reason that open source projects had been able to enter the server market is the market's use of standardized protocols. The document then suggests that this can be stopped by \"extending these protocols and developing new protocols\" and \"de-commoditiz[ing] protocols &amp; applications\". This policy has been internally nicknamed \"embrace, extend, extinguish\". Document I also suggests that open source software \"is long-term credible ... FUD tactics can not be used to combat it\", and \"Recent case studies (the Internet) provide very dramatic evidence ... that commercial quality can be achieved / exceeded by OSS projects.\"\nDocuments I and II were filed as evidence on January 16, 2007, in the case of \"Comes v. Microsoft\".\nDocument III.\nThe statement from Aurelia van den Berg, the Press and Public Relations manager of Microsoft Netherlands, puts forward Microsoft's view on the first two documents. It says that the documents are not an \"official position\", but that \"it is routine and appropriate\" to research competitors. This statement is only a brief response, but many points were later incorporated into an official response from Microsoft.\nDocument VII.\nThis document is a summary of the results of a survey of developers and IT managers, carried out by Microsoft, describing reactions to Microsoft's shared-source program. Eric Raymond provides commentary suggesting ways that the open-source community can promote itself based on the results of the survey. The results show favorable responses about both open-source and shared-source principles. It also describes low total cost of ownership (TCO) as a major reason for Linux adoption, in contradiction to many documents released by the company suggesting that Windows has a lower TCO than Linux solutions.\nDocument VIII.\n\"OSS and Government\", aka \"Halloween VIII: Doing the Damage-Control Dance\", is a memo from Group Vice President of Worldwide Sales, Orlando Ayala, to general managers of Microsoft regional subsidiaries. It describes the availability of support from Microsoft corporate for regional sales personnel facing competition from Linux in government markets.\nDocument X.\nAn e-mail from consultant Mike Anderer to SCO Group's Chris Sontag, also known as \"Halloween X: Follow The Money\". The document describes, among other points, Microsoft's channeling of $86\u00a0million (equivalent to $\u00a0million in 2024) to SCO.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "43316", "revid": "45093799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43316", "title": "Open mail relay", "text": "SMTP server that allows anyone to send e-mail through it\nAn open mail relay is a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server configured in such a way that it allows anyone on the Internet to send e-mail through it, not just mail destined to or originating from known users. This used to be the default configuration in many mail servers; indeed, it was the way the Internet was initially set up, but open mail relays have become unpopular because of their exploitation by spammers and worms. Many relays were closed, or were placed on blacklists by other servers.\nHistory and technology.\nUntil the 1990s, mail servers were commonly intentionally configured as open relays; in fact, this was frequently the installation default setting. The traditional store and forward method of relaying e-mail to its destination required that it was passed from computer to computer (through and beyond the Internet) via modems on telephone lines. For many early networks, such as UUCPNET, FidoNet and BITNET, lists of machines that were open relays were a core part of those networks. Filtering and speed of e-mail delivery were not priorities at that time and in any case the government and educational servers that were initially on the Internet were covered by a federal edict forbidding the transfer of commercial messages.\nAbuse by spammers.\nIn the mid-1990s, with the rise of spamming, spammers resorted to re-routing their e-mail through third party e-mail servers to avoid detection and to exploit the additional resources of these open relay servers. Spammers would send one e-mail to the open relay and (effectively) include a large blind carbon copy list, then the open relay would relay that spam to the entire list. While this greatly reduced the bandwidth requirements for spammers at a time when Internet connections were limited, it forced each spam to be an exact copy and thus easier to detect. After abuse by spammers became widespread, operating an open relay came to be frowned upon among the majority of Internet server administrators and other prominent users. Open relays are recommended against in RFC 2505 and RFC 5321 (which defines SMTP). The exact copy nature of spam using open relays made it easy to create bulk e-mail detection systems such as Vipul's Razor and the Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse. To counter this, spammers were forced to switch to using hash busters to make them less effective and the advantage of using open relays was removed since every copy of spam was \"unique\" and had to be sent individually.\nSince open mail relays make no effort to authenticate the sender of an e-mail, open mail relays are vulnerable to address spoofing.\nAnti-spam efforts.\nMany Internet service providers use Domain Name System-based Blackhole Lists (DNSBL) to disallow mail from open relays. Once a mail server is detected or reported that allows third parties to send mail through them, they will be added to one or more such lists, and other e-mail servers using those lists will reject any mail coming from those sites. The relay need not actually be used for sending spam to be blacklisted; instead, it may be blacklisted after a simple test that just confirms open access.\nThis trend reduced the percentage of mail senders that were open relays from over 90% down to well under 1% over several years. This led spammers to adopt other techniques, such as the use of botnets of zombie computers to send spam.\nOne consequence of the new unacceptability of open relays was an inconvenience for some end users and certain Internet service providers. To allow customers to use their e-mail addresses at Internet locations other than the company's systems (such as at school or work), many mail sites explicitly allowed open relaying so that customers could send e-mail via the ISP from any location. Once open relay became unacceptable because of abuse (and unusable because of blocking of open relays), ISPs and other sites had to adopt new protocols to allow remote users to send mail. These include smart hosts, SMTP-AUTH, POP before SMTP, and the use of virtual private networks (VPNs). The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has written a best current practices covering Email Submission Operations in RFC 5068.\nNote that the above only becomes an issue if the user wishes to (or has to) continue to send e-mail remotely, using the \"same\" SMTP server which they were previously accessing locally. If they have valid access to some \"other\" SMTP server from their new, remote location, then they will typically be able to use that new server to send e-mails as if from their old address, even when this server is properly secured. (Although this may involve some reconfiguration of the user's email client which may not be entirely straightforward.)\nThe CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 makes it illegal to send spam through an open relay in the United States, but makes no provision on their use for personal e-mail or their operation in general; the effectiveness of the act has been questioned.\nModern-day proponents.\nThe most famous open mail relay operating today is probably that of John Gilmore, who argues that running an open relay is a freedom of speech issue. His server is included on many open relay blacklists (many of which are generated by \"automatic detection\", that is, by anti-spam blacklisters sending an (unsolicited) test e-mail to other servers to see if they will be relayed). These measures cause much of his outgoing e-mail to be blocked. Along with his further deliberate configuration of the server, his open relay enables people to send e-mail without their IP address being directly visible to the recipient and thereby send e-mail anonymously. In 2002, his open relay, along with 24 others, was used by a computer worm to propagate itself.\nJohn Gilmore and other open relay proponents declare that they do not support spam and spamming, but see bigger threat in attempts to limit Web capabilities that may block evolution of the new, next generation technologies. They compare the network communication restrictions with restrictions that some phone companies tried to place on their lines in the past, preventing transferring of computer data rather than speech.\nClosing relays.\nIn order not to be considered \"open\", an e-mail relay should be secure and configured to accept and forward only the following messages (details will vary from system to system\u2014in particular, further restrictions may well apply):\nIn particular, a properly secured SMTP mail relay should not accept and forward arbitrary e-mails from non-local IP addresses to non-local mailboxes by an unauthenticated or unauthorized user.\nIn general, any other rules an administrator chooses to enforce (for instance, based on what an e-mail gives as its own envelope from address) must be in addition to, rather than instead of, the above. If not, the relay is still effectively open (for instance, by the above rules): it is easy to forge e-mail header and envelope information, it is considerably harder to successfully forge an IP address in a TCP/IP transaction because of the three-way handshake that occurs as a connection is started.\nOpen relays have also resulted from security flaws in software, rather than misconfiguration by system administrators. In these cases, security patches need to be applied to close the relay.\nInternet initiatives to close open relays have ultimately missed their intended purpose, because spammers have created distributed botnets of zombie computers that contain malware with mail relaying capability. The number of clients under spammers' control is now so great that previous anti-spam countermeasures that focused on closing open relays are no longer effective.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

For example, one can define a probability space which models the throwing of a dice.\nA probability space consists of three elements:\nIn order to provide a model of probability, these elements must satisfy probability axioms.\nIn the example of the throw of a standard die,\nWhen an experiment is conducted, it results in exactly one outcome formula_16 from the sample space formula_2. All the events in the event space formula_3 that contain the selected outcome formula_16 are said to \"have occurred\". The probability function formula_4 must be so defined that if the experiment were repeated arbitrarily many times, the number of occurrences of each event as a fraction of the total number of experiments, will most likely tend towards the probability assigned to that event.\nThe Soviet mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov introduced the notion of a probability space and the axioms of probability in the 1930s. In modern probability theory, there are alternative approaches for axiomatization, such as the algebra of random variables.\nIntroduction.\nA probability space is a mathematical triplet formula_1 that presents a model for a particular class of real-world situations. As with other models, its author ultimately defines which elements formula_2, formula_3, and formula_4 will contain.\nNot every subset of the sample space formula_2 must necessarily be considered an event: some of the subsets are simply not of interest, others cannot be \"measured\". This is not so obvious in a case like a coin toss. In a different example, one could consider javelin throw lengths, where the events typically are intervals like \"between 60 and 65 meters\" and unions of such intervals, but not sets like the \"irrational numbers between 60 and 65 meters\".\nDefinition.\nIn short, a probability space is a measure space such that the measure of the whole space is equal to one.\nThe expanded definition is the following: a probability space is a triple formula_41 consisting of:\nDiscrete case.\nDiscrete probability theory needs only at most countable sample spaces formula_2. Probabilities can be ascribed to points of formula_2 by the probability mass function formula_65 such that formula_66. All subsets of formula_2 can be treated as events (thus, formula_68 is the power set). The probability measure takes the simple form\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe greatest \u03c3-algebra formula_68 describes the complete information. In general, a \u03c3-algebra formula_70 corresponds to a finite or countable partition formula_71, the general form of an event formula_48 being formula_73. See also the examples.\nThe case formula_74 is permitted by the definition, but rarely used, since such formula_16 can safely be excluded from the sample space.\nGeneral case.\nIf \u03a9 is uncountable, still, it may happen that \"P\"(\"\u03c9\") \u2260 0 for some \"\u03c9\"; such \"\u03c9\" are called atoms. They are an at most countable (maybe empty) set, whose probability is the sum of probabilities of all atoms. If this sum is equal to 1 then all other points can safely be excluded from the sample space, returning us to the discrete case. Otherwise, if the sum of probabilities of all atoms is between 0 and 1, then the probability space decomposes into a discrete (atomic) part (maybe empty) and a non-atomic part.\nNon-atomic case.\nIf \"P\"(\"\u03c9\") = 0 for all \"\u03c9\" \u2208 \u03a9 (in this case, \u03a9 must be uncountable, because otherwise P(\u03a9) = 1 could not be satisfied), then equation (\u204e) fails: the probability of a set is not necessarily the sum over the probabilities of its elements, as summation is only defined for countable numbers of elements. This makes the probability space theory much more technical. A formulation stronger than summation, measure theory is applicable. Initially the probabilities are ascribed to some \"generator\" sets (see the examples). Then a limiting procedure allows assigning probabilities to sets that are limits of sequences of generator sets, or limits of limits, and so on. All these sets are the \u03c3-algebra formula_76. For technical details see Carath\u00e9odory's extension theorem. Sets belonging to formula_76 are called measurable. In general they are much more complicated than generator sets, but much better than non-measurable sets.\nComplete probability space.\nA probability space formula_78 is said to be a complete probability space if for all formula_79 with formula_80 and all formula_81 one has formula_82. Often, the study of probability spaces is restricted to complete probability spaces.\nExamples.\nDiscrete examples.\nExample 1.\nIf the experiment consists of just one flip of a fair coin, then the outcome is either heads or tails: formula_83. The \u03c3-algebra formula_84 contains formula_85 events, namely: formula_86 (\"heads\"), formula_87 (\"tails\"), formula_88 (\"neither heads nor tails\"), and formula_89 (\"either heads or tails\"); in other words, formula_90. There is a fifty percent chance of tossing heads and fifty percent for tails, so the probability measure in this example is formula_91, formula_92, formula_93, formula_94.\nExample 2.\nThe fair coin is tossed three times. There are 8 possible outcomes: \u03a9 = {HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT} (here \"HTH\" for example means that first time the coin landed heads, the second time tails, and the last time heads again). The complete information is described by the \u03c3-algebra formula_95 of 28 = 256 events, where each of the events is a subset of \u03a9.\nAlice knows the outcome of the second toss only. Thus her incomplete information is described by the partition \u03a9 = \"A\"1 \u2294 \"A\"2 = {HHH, HHT, THH, THT} \u2294 {HTH, HTT, TTH, TTT}, where \u2294 is the \"disjoint union\", and the corresponding \u03c3-algebra formula_96. Bryan knows only the total number of tails. His partition contains four parts: \u03a9 = \"B\"0 \u2294 \"B\"1 \u2294 \"B\"2 \u2294 \"B\"3 = {HHH} \u2294 {HHT, HTH, THH} \u2294 {TTH, THT, HTT} \u2294 {TTT}; accordingly, his \u03c3-algebra formula_97 contains 24 = 16 events.\nThe two \u03c3-algebras are incomparable: neither formula_98 nor formula_99; both are sub-\u03c3-algebras of 2\u03a9.\nExample 3.\nIf 100 voters are to be drawn randomly from among all voters in California and asked whom they will vote for governor, then the set of all sequences of 100 Californian voters would be the sample space \u03a9. We assume that sampling without replacement is used: only sequences of 100 \"different\" voters are allowed. For simplicity an ordered sample is considered, that is a sequence (Alice, Bryan) is different from (Bryan, Alice). We also take for granted that each potential voter knows exactly his/her future choice, that is he/she does not choose randomly.\nAlice knows only whether or not Arnold Schwarzenegger has received at least 60 votes. Her incomplete information is described by the \u03c3-algebra formula_100 that contains: (1) the set of all sequences in \u03a9 where at least 60 people vote for Schwarzenegger; (2) the set of all sequences where fewer than 60 vote for Schwarzenegger; (3) the whole sample space \u03a9; and (4) the empty set \u2205.\nBryan knows the exact number of voters who are going to vote for Schwarzenegger. His incomplete information is described by the corresponding partition \u03a9 = \"B\"0 \u2294 \"B\"1 \u2294 \u22ef \u2294 \"B\"100 and the \u03c3-algebra formula_97 consists of 2101 events.\nIn this case, Alice's \u03c3-algebra is a subset of Bryan's: formula_102. Bryan's \u03c3-algebra is in turn a subset of the much larger \"complete information\" \u03c3-algebra 2\u03a9 consisting of 2\"n\"(\"n\"\u22121)\u22ef(\"n\"\u221299) events, where \"n\" is the number of all potential voters in California.\nNon-atomic examples.\nExample 4.\nA number between 0 and 1 is chosen at random, uniformly. Here \u03a9 = [0,1], formula_76 is the \u03c3-algebra of Borel sets on \u03a9, and \"P\" is the Lebesgue measure on [0,1].\nIn this case, the open intervals of the form (\"a\",\"b\"), where 0 &lt; \"a\" &lt; \"b\" &lt; 1, could be taken as the generator sets. Each such set can be ascribed the probability of \"P\"((\"a\",\"b\")) = (\"b\" \u2212 \"a\"), which generates the Lebesgue measure on [0,1], and the Borel \u03c3-algebra on \u03a9.\nExample 5.\nA fair coin is tossed endlessly. Here one can take \u03a9 = {0,1}\u221e, the set of all infinite sequences of numbers 0 and 1. Cylinder sets {(\"x\"1, \"x\"2, ...) \u2208 \u03a9 : \"x\"1 = \"a\"1, ..., \"x\"\"n\" = \"a\"\"n\"} may be used as the generator sets. Each such set describes an event in which the first \"n\" tosses have resulted in a fixed sequence (\"a\"1, ..., \"a\"\"n\"), and the rest of the sequence may be arbitrary. Each such event can be naturally given the probability of 2\u2212\"n\".\nThese two non-atomic examples are closely related: a sequence (\"x\"1, \"x\"2, ...) \u2208 {0,1}\u221e leads to the number 2\u22121\"x\"1 + 2\u22122\"x\"2 + \u22ef \u2208 [0,1]. This is not a one-to-one correspondence between {0,1}\u221e and [0,1] however: it is an isomorphism modulo zero, which allows for treating the two probability spaces as two forms of the same probability space. In fact, all non-pathological non-atomic probability spaces are the same in this sense. They are so-called standard probability spaces. Basic applications of probability spaces are insensitive to standardness. However, non-discrete conditioning is easy and natural on standard probability spaces, otherwise it becomes obscure.\nRelated concepts.\nRandom variables.\nA random variable \"X\" is a measurable function \"X\": \u03a9 \u2192 \"S\" from the sample space \u03a9 to another measurable space \"S\" called the \"state space\".\nIf \"A\" \u2282 \"S\", the notation Pr(\"X\" \u2208 \"A\") is a commonly used shorthand for formula_104.\nDefining the events in terms of the sample space.\nIf \u03a9 is countable, we almost always define formula_76 as the power set of \u03a9, i.e. formula_106 which is trivially a \u03c3-algebra and the biggest one we can create using \u03a9. We can therefore omit formula_76 and just write (\u03a9,P) to define the probability space.\nOn the other hand, if \u03a9 is uncountable and we use formula_106 we get into trouble defining our probability measure \"P\" because formula_76 is too \"large\", i.e. there will often be sets to which it will be impossible to assign a unique measure. In this case, we have to use a smaller \u03c3-algebra formula_76, for example the Borel algebra of \u03a9, which is the smallest \u03c3-algebra that makes all open sets measurable.\nConditional probability.\nKolmogorov's definition of probability spaces gives rise to the natural concept of conditional probability. Every set A with non-zero probability (that is, \"P\"(\"A\") &gt; 0) defines another probability measure\nformula_111\non the space. This is usually pronounced as the \"probability of \"B\" given \"A\"\".\nFor any event \"A\" such that \"P\"(\"A\") &gt; 0, the function \"Q\" defined by \"Q\"(\"B\") = \"P\"(\"B\"\u00a0|\u00a0\"A\") for all events B is itself a probability measure.\nIndependence.\nTwo events, \"A\" and \"B\" are said to be independent if \"P\"(\"A\" \u2229 \"B\") = \"P\"(\"A\") \"P\"(\"B\").\nTwo random variables, X and Y, are said to be independent if any event defined in terms of X is independent of any event defined in terms of Y. Formally, they generate independent \u03c3-algebras, where two \u03c3-algebras G and H, which are subsets of F are said to be independent if any element of G is independent of any element of H.\nMutual exclusivity.\nTwo events, \"A\" and \"B\" are said to be mutually exclusive or \"disjoint\" if the occurrence of one implies the non-occurrence of the other, i.e., their intersection is empty. This is a stronger condition than the probability of their intersection being zero.\nIf \"A\" and \"B\" are disjoint events, then \"P\"(\"A\" \u222a \"B\") = \"P\"(\"A\") + \"P\"(\"B\"). This extends to a (finite or countably infinite) sequence of events. However, the probability of the union of an uncountable set of events is not the sum of their probabilities. For example, if Z is a normally distributed random variable, then \"P\"(\"Z\" = \"x\") is 0 for any x, but \"P\"(\"Z\" \u2208 R) = 1.\nThe event \"A\" \u2229 \"B\" is referred to as \"\"A\" and \"B\"\", and the event \"A\" \u222a \"B\" as \"\"A\" or \"B\"\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n The first major treatise blending calculus with probability theory, originally in French: \"Th\u00e9orie Analytique des Probabilit\u00e9s\".\n The modern measure-theoretic foundation of probability theory; the original German version (\"Grundbegriffe der Wahrscheinlichkeitrechnung\") appeared in 1933.\n An empiricist, Bayesian approach to the foundations of probability theory.\n Foundations of probability theory based on nonstandard analysis.

The term MAN is applied to the interconnection of local area networks (LANs) in a city into a single larger network which may then also offer efficient connection to a wide area network. The term is also used to describe the interconnection of several LANs in a metropolitan area through the use of point-to-point connections between them.\nHistory.\nBy 1999, local area networks (LANs) were well established and providing data communication in buildings and offices. For the interconnection of LANs within a city, businesses relied primarily on the public switched telephone network. But while the telephone network was able to support the packet-based exchange of data that the various LAN protocols implemented, the bandwidth of the telephone network was already under heavy demand from circuit-switched voice, and the telephone exchanges were ill-designed to cope with the traffic spikes that LANs tended to produce.\nTo interconnect local area networks more effectively, it was suggested that office buildings are connected using the single-mode optical fiber lines, which were by that time widely used in long-haul telephone trunks. Such dark fibre links were in some cases already installed on customer premises and telephone companies started to offer their dark fibre within their subscriber packages. Fibre optic metropolitan area networks were operated by telephone companies as private networks for their customers and did not necessarily have full integration with the public wide area network (WAN) through gateways.\nBesides the larger companies that connected their offices across metropolitan areas, universities and research institutions also adopted dark fibre as their metropolitan area network backbone. In West Berlin the BERCOM project built up a multifunctional broadband communications system to connect the mainframe computers that publicly funded universities and research institutions in the city housed. The BERCOM MAN project could progress at speed because the Deutsche Bundespost had already installed hundreds of miles of fibre optic cable in West Berlin. Like other metropolitan dark fibre networks at the time, the dark fibre network in West Berlin had a star topology with a hub somewhere in the city centre. The backbone of the dedicated BERCOM MAN for universities and research institutions was an optical fibre double ring that used a high-speed slotted ring protocol developed by the GMD Research Centre for Innovative Computer Systems and Telephony. The BERCOM MAN backbone could thus support two times 280\u00a0Mbit/s data transfer.\nThe productive use of dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) provided another impetus for the development of metropolitan area networks in the 2000s. Long haul DWDM, with ranges from 0 to 3000+\u00a0km, had been developed so that companies that stored large amounts of data on different sites could exchange data or establish mirrors of their file server. With the use of DWDM on the existing fibre optic MANs of carriers, companies no longer needed to connect their LANs with a dedicated fibre optic link. With DWDM companies could build dedicated MANs using the existing dark fibre network of a provider in a city. MANs thus became cheaper to build and maintain. The DWDM platforms provided by dark fibre providers in cities allow for a single fibre pair to be divided into 32 wavelengths. One wavelength could support between 10\u00a0Mbit/s and 10\u00a0Gbit/s. Thus companies that paid for a MAN to connect different office sites within a city could increase the bandwidths of their MAN backbone as part of their subscription. DWDM platforms also alleviated the need for protocol conversion to connect LANs in a city, because any protocol and any traffic type could be transmitted using DWDM. Effectively it gave companies wishing to establish a MAN choice of protocol.\nMetro Ethernet uses a fibre optic ring as a Gigabit Ethernet MAN backbone within a larger city. The ring topology is implemented using Internet Protocol (IP) so that data can be rerouted if a link is congested or fails. In the US the Sprint was an early adopter of fibre optic rings that routed IP packets on the MAN backbone. Between 2002 and 2003 Sprint built three MAN rings to cover San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose, and in turn connected these three metro rings with a further two rings. The Sprint metro rings routed voice and data, were connected to several local telecom exchange points and totalled 189 miles of fibre optic cable. The metro rings also connected many cities that went on to become part of the Silicon Valley tech-hub, such as Fremont, Milpitas, Mountain View, Palo Alto, Redwood City, San Bruno, San Carlos, Santa Clara and Sunnyvale.\nThe metro Ethernet rings that did not route IP traffic instead used one of the various proprietary Spanning Tree Protocol implementations; each MAN ring had a \"root bridge\". Because layer 2 switching can not operate if there is a loop in the network, the protocols to support L2 MAN rings all need to block redundant links and thus block part of the ring. Capsuling protocols, such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), were also deployed to address the drawbacks of operating L2 metro Ethernet rings.\nMetro Ethernet was effectively the extension of Ethernet protocols beyond the local area network (LAN) and the ensuing investment in Ethernet led to the deployment of carrier Ethernet, where Ethernet protocols are used in wide area networks (WANs). The efforts of the Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) in defining best practice and standards for metropolitan area networks thus also defined carrier Ethernet. While the IEEE tried to standardise the emerging Ethernet-based proprietary protocols, industry forums such as the MEF filled the gap and in January 2013 launched a certification for network equipment that can be configured to meet \"Carrier Ethernet 2.0\" specifications.\nMetropolitan Internet exchange points.\nInternet exchange points (IXs) have historically been important for the connection of MANs to the national or global Internet. The Boston Metropolitan Exchange Point (Boston MXP) enabled metro Ethernet providers, such as the HarvardNet to exchange data with national carriers, such as the Sprint Corporation and AT&amp;T. Exchange points also serve as low-latency links between campus area networks, thus the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Boston University could exchange data, voice and video using the Boston MXP. Further examples of metropolitan Internet exchanges in the USA that were operational as of 2002[ [update]] include the Anchorage Metropolitan Access Point (AMAP), the Seattle Internet Exchange (SIX), the Dallas-Fort Worth Metropolitan Access Point (DFMAP) and the Denver Internet Exchange (IX-Denver). Verizon put into operation three regional metropolitan exchanges to interconnect MANs and give them access to the Internet. The MAE-West serves the MANs of San Jose, Los Angeles and California. The MAE-East interconnects the MANs of New York City, Washington, D.C., and Miami. While the MAE-Central interconnects the MANs of Dallas, Texas, and Illinois.\nIn larger cities several local providers may have built a dark fibre MAN backbone. In London, the metro Ethernet rings of several providers make up the London MAN infrastructure. Like other MANs, the London MAN primarily serves the needs of its urban customers, who typically need a high number of connections with low bandwidth, a fast transit to other MAN providers, as well as high bandwidth access to national and international long-haul providers. Within the MAN of larger cities, metropolitan exchange points now play a vital role. The London Internet Exchange (LINX) had by 2005 built up several exchange points across the Greater London region.\nCities that host one of the international Internet exchanges have become a preferred location for companies and data centres. The Amsterdam Internet Exchange (AMS-IX) is the world's second-largest Internet exchange and has attracted companies to Amsterdam that are dependent on high-speed internet access. The Amsterdam metropolitan area network has benefited too from high-speed Internet access. Similarly Frankfurt has become a magnet for data centres of international companies because it hosts the non-profit DE-CIX, the largest Internet exchange in the world. The business model of the metro DE-CIX is to reduce the transit cost for local carriers by keeping data in the metropolitan area or region, while at the same time allowing long-haul low-latency peering globally with other major MANs.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "43327", "revid": "46264695", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43327", "title": "Borel set", "text": "Class of mathematical sets\nIn mathematics, the Borel sets of a topological space are a particular class of \"well-behaved\" subsets of that space. For example, whereas an arbitrary subset of the real numbers might fail to be Lebesgue measurable, every Borel set of reals is universally measurable. Which sets are Borel can be specified in a number of equivalent ways. Borel sets are named after \u00c9mile Borel.\nThe most usual definition goes through the notion of a \u03c3-algebra, which is a collection of subsets of a topological space formula_1 that contains both the empty set and the entire set formula_1, and is closed under countable union and countable intersection.\nThen we can define the Borel \u03c3-algebra over formula_1 to be the smallest \u03c3-algebra containing all open sets of formula_1. A Borel subset of formula_1 is then simply an element of this \u03c3-algebra.\nBorel sets are important in measure theory, since any measure defined on the open sets of a space, or on the closed sets of a space, must also be defined on all Borel sets of that space. Any measure defined on the Borel sets is called a Borel measure. Borel sets and the associated Borel hierarchy also play a fundamental role in descriptive set theory.\nIn some contexts, Borel sets are defined to be generated by the compact sets of the topological space, rather than the open sets. The two definitions are equivalent for many well-behaved spaces, including all Hausdorff \u03c3-compact spaces, but can be different in more pathological spaces.\nGenerating the Borel algebra.\nIn the case that formula_1 is a metric space, the Borel algebra in the first sense may be described \"generatively\" as follows.\nFor a collection formula_7 of subsets of formula_1 (that is, for any subset of the power set formula_9formula_10 of formula_1), let\nNow define by transfinite induction a sequence formula_17, where formula_18 is an ordinal number, in the following manner:\nThe claim is that the Borel algebra is formula_27, where formula_28 is the first uncountable ordinal number. That is, the Borel algebra can be \"generated\" from the class of open sets by iterating the operation\nformula_29\nto the first uncountable ordinal.\nTo prove this claim, any open set in a metric space is the union of an increasing sequence of closed sets. In particular, complementation of sets maps formula_17 into itself for any limit ordinal formula_18; moreover if formula_18 is an uncountable limit ordinal, formula_17 is closed under countable unions.\nFor each Borel set formula_34, there is some countable ordinal formula_35 such that formula_34 can be obtained by iterating the operation over formula_35. However, as formula_34 varies over all Borel sets, formula_35 will vary over all the countable ordinals, and thus the first ordinal at which all the Borel sets are obtained is formula_40, the first uncountable ordinal.\nThe resulting sequence of sets is termed the Borel hierarchy.\nExample.\nAn important example, especially in the theory of probability, is the Borel algebra on the set of real numbers. It is the algebra on which the Borel measure is defined. Given a real random variable defined on a probability space, its probability distribution is by definition also a measure on the Borel algebra.\nThe Borel algebra on the reals is the smallest \u03c3-algebra on formula_41 that contains all the intervals.\nIn the construction by transfinite induction, it can be shown that, in each step, the number of sets is, at most, the cardinality of the continuum. So, the total number of Borel sets is less than or equal to\nformula_42\nIn fact, the cardinality of the collection of Borel sets is equal to that of the continuum (compare to the number of Lebesgue measurable sets that exist, which is strictly larger and equal to formula_43).\nStandard Borel spaces and Kuratowski theorems.\nLet formula_1 be a topological space. The Borel space associated to formula_1 is the pair formula_46, where formula_47 is the \u03c3-algebra of Borel sets of formula_1.\nGeorge Mackey defined a Borel space somewhat differently, writing that it is \"a set together with a distinguished \u03c3-field of subsets called its Borel sets.\" However, modern usage is to call the distinguished sub-algebra the \"measurable sets\" and such spaces \"measurable spaces\". The reason for this distinction is that the Borel sets are the \u03c3-algebra generated by \"open\" sets (of a topological space), whereas Mackey's definition refers to a set equipped with an \"arbitrary\" \u03c3-algebra. There exist measurable spaces that are not Borel spaces, for any choice of topology on the underlying space.\nMeasurable spaces form a category in which the morphisms are measurable functions between measurable spaces. A function formula_49 is measurable if it pulls back measurable sets, i.e., for all measurable sets formula_34 in formula_51, the set formula_52 is measurable in formula_1.\nTheorem. Let formula_1 be a Polish space, that is, a topological space such that there is a metric formula_55 on formula_1 that defines the topology of formula_1 and that makes formula_1 a complete separable metric space. Then \"formula_1\" as a Borel space is isomorphic to one of\nConsidered as Borel spaces, the real line formula_41, the union of formula_41 with a countable set, and formula_64 are isomorphic.\nA standard Borel space is the Borel space associated to a Polish space. A standard Borel space is characterized up to isomorphism by its cardinality, and any uncountable standard Borel space has the cardinality of the continuum.\nFor subsets of Polish spaces, Borel sets can be characterized as those sets that are the ranges of continuous injective maps defined on Polish spaces. Note however, that the range of a continuous noninjective map may fail to be Borel. See analytic set.\nEvery probability measure on a standard Borel space turns it into a standard probability space.\nNon-Borel sets.\nAn example of a subset of the reals that is non-Borel, due to Lusin, is described below. In contrast, an example of a non-measurable set cannot be exhibited, although the existence of such a set is implied, for example, by the axiom of choice.\nEvery irrational number has a unique representation by an infinite simple continued fraction\nformula_65\nwhere formula_66 is some integer and all the other numbers formula_67 are \"positive\" integers. Let formula_68 be the set of all irrational numbers that correspond to sequences formula_69 with the following property: there exists an infinite subsequence formula_70 such that each element is a divisor of the next element. This set formula_68 is not Borel. However, it is analytic (all Borel sets are also analytic), and complete in the class of analytic sets. For more details see descriptive set theory and the book by A. S. Kechris (see References), especially Exercise (27.2) on page 209, Definition (22.9) on page 169, Exercise (3.4)(ii) on page 14, and on page 196.\nIt's important to note, that while Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel axioms (ZF) are sufficient to formalize the construction of formula_68, it cannot be proven in ZF alone that formula_68 is non-Borel. In fact, it is consistent with ZF that formula_74 is a countable union of countable sets, so that any subset of formula_74 is a Borel set.\nAnother non-Borel set is an inverse image formula_76 of an infinite parity function formula_77. However, this is a proof of existence (via the axiom of choice), not an explicit example.\nAlternative non-equivalent definitions.\nAccording to Paul Halmos, a subset of a locally compact Hausdorff topological space is called a \"Borel set\" if it belongs to the smallest \u03c3-ring containing all compact sets.\nNorberg and Vervaat redefine the Borel algebra of a topological space formula_1 as the formula_79-algebra generated by its open subsets and its compact saturated subsets. This definition is well-suited for applications in the case where formula_1 is not Hausdorff. It coincides with the usual definition if formula_1 is second countable or if every compact saturated subset is closed (which is the case in particular if formula_1 is Hausdorff).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

PADI courses range from entry level to advanced recreational diver certification. Further, they provide several diving skills courses connected with specific equipment or conditions, some diving related informational courses and a range of recreational diving instructor certifications. \nThey also offer various technical diving courses. As of 2020, PADI claims to have issued 28 million scuba certifications. The levels are not specified and may include minor specialisations. Some of the certifications align with WRSTC and ISO standards, and these are recognised worldwide. Some other certification is unique to PADI and has no equivalence anywhere, or may be part of other agencies' standards for certification for more general diving skill levels.\nHistory.\nIn 1966, PADI was founded by John Cronin and Ralph Erickson. Cronin was originally a NAUI instructor who decided to form his own organization with Erickson, and to break diver training down into several modular courses instead of the single universal course then prevalent. Erickson developed continuing education scuba courses during this time and wrote the initial issue of the first trade magazine for scuba instructors, \"The Undersea Journal\". Cronin got the idea for PADI's Positive Identification Card at a trade show. PADI established the Master Scuba Diver certification, the industry's first certification awarded for accumulation of specified certification and experience, and not based on a specific training program, in 1973, later launching the modular scuba program. By 1979, PADI was producing 100,000 certifications a year after previously hitting 25,000 a year. PADI was the first organization to use confined water or pool dives for training new divers and introduced the PADI Rescue Diver course and manual for rescue training during the 1980s.\nIn 1989, PADI founded Project AWARE to help conserve underwater environments. In 1992, Project AWARE Foundation became a registered nonprofit organization with an environmental mission and purpose. PADI continues to partner with PADI AWARE, supporting the organization with in-kind services, donations through its processes and connection to the PADI network of divers, dive professionals and dive centers. PADI AWARE information has been integrated in most courses and divers are offered the chance to exchange their normal certification card for an AWARE-certification card by making a donation to the program when sending in their application for a new certification.\nIn 2006, PADI was severely criticized by a Coroner's court in the United Kingdom for providing what experts regarded as short and insufficient training. Although PADI training standards differ from those formerly prevalent in the United Kingdom under the BSAC system, PADI training standards are consistent with World Recreational Scuba Training Council standards.\nOn 9 August 2012, Lincolnshire Management and Providence Equity Partners jointly acquired PADI from Seidler Equity Partners. In 2015, Providence Equity Partners acquired majority stake of PADI from Lincolnshire Management.\nIn 2017, Providence Equity Partners LLC sold PADI to Canadian investment firm \"Altas Partners\" and French private equity firm \"Florac\" for 700 million USD, through an entity called Mandarin fish Holding.\nIn 2018, PADI launched PADI Travel, an online dive travel resource and booking platform for dive resort and live-aboard packages.\nIn 2021, PADI reported it had a membership of over 128,000 professional members and 6,600 dive centers, and had awarded more than 28 million diving certifications internationally. PADI operates in 186 countries and\nterritories. From 2015 to 2020, the average male to female membership split was approximately 63% to 37% respectively. The organization hosts Women's Dive Day events across the globe in an effort to increase awareness for women divers.\nIn 2025, Canadian investment firm \"Altas Partners\" and French private equity firm \"Florac\" sold PADI to a undisclosed owner. \nTraining system.\nPADI courses are performance-based diver training programs,\nand at the introductory level emphasizes practical knowledge, safety and motor skills. The basics of diving physics and physiology are introduced during entry level programs. The details of these concepts are left for later courses when they are necessary for the required competences of the specific training. According to PADI, these practices fall within current modern learning philosophies and receive regular updates via peer review.\nThe PADI training system is composed of modules with standardized learning objectives divided into theory and practical skills development. Each module is a stand-alone course for which certification is provided to the participant on successful completion of the course. Theory is mainly conveyed by way of self-study using books or digital training using PADI E-Learning. All study options are supplemented with video and, in most cases, live instruction to help the participant visualize what they have read. Confirmation of the student diver's level of competence in standardized knowledge review sessions is carried out by a scuba instructor using both written tests and personal observation during dives to verify the student's knowledge and skills. Practical skills are obtained through confined water training (pools or relatively shallow water) and performance evaluations in open water.\nPADI courses target four progressive experience demographics, designated by PADI as \"Youth\", \"Beginner\", \"Continuing Education\" and \"Professional\". Options are available for students or instructors to attain additional certifications across a range of categories, including \"Essentials\", \"Safety Focus\", \"Advanced Skills\", \"Cold Water\", \"Conservation\", \"Photography\", \"Discovery\", \"Freediving\" and \"Technical Diving\".\nFor the youth demographic, the Padi Seal Team and Bubblemaker Programs are provided for students ages 8+.\nAs of 2023, the courses in \"Beginner\", \"Continuing Education\" and \"Professional\" categories include:\nTraining standards.\nPADI training standards are generally inaccessible to the public via internet search, making an informed decision on whether a specific training course is appropriate to the diver's needs difficult. Those few programs which comply with ISO standards can be assumed to at least nominally include all the requirements of the ISO standard, but not necessarily anything more. \nSome PADI courses, i.e. those which have no actual diving component, may be presented and assessed by a PADI Divemaster registered with PADI to run the specific course. Some additional training and course attendance is required. These courses do not include actual diving skills, just skills or knowledge that may be useful while diving or interesting in the context of diving.\nSome PADI training standards have been found to be ambiguous of contradictory, For example, the PADI Advanced Open Water Diver course does not require direct instructor supervision of a student during \"adventure dives\", which may include a diver's first experience using a dry suit, while the standard for the PADI Dry Suit Diver course requires not only direct supervision of the student by the instructor, during open water dives, but also that open water dives must be preceded by a theory class, and a confined water skills training session, both of which must be satisfactorily completed before venturing into open water.\nA PADI Open Water Instructor can be registered as a specialty instructor for several specialties, without demonstrating competence to teach or even perform those specialties, including Dry Suit Diver, which requires a significant skill set and understanding of the principles to be done safely.\nWorkplace programs.\nPADI offers a specialty program called Public Safety Diver for divers who are either employed in or serve as volunteers in the public safety diving sector principally within the United States. This certification is not recognised in some countries which have national standards for occupational diving qualifications and require registration with a national body.\nFirst aid programs.\nPADI, via its subsidiary, \"Emergency First Response, Corp\", distributes the following programs in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and first aid for both divers and non-divers: These may not be recognised by health and safety authorities in some jurisdictions where workplace first aid certification must be through a nationally or state accredited training provider.\nAccreditation and memberships.\nPADI courses are recognized, recommended and cited by the institutions and organizations listed below for both recreational diving and vocational training.\nPADI courses are recommended for college credit in the US by ACE. PADI is a member of the United States Recreational Scuba Training Council (RSTC).\nRecognition's and equivalencies has been established between PADI and Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Mondiale des Activit\u00e9s Subaquatiques, the Colombian Navy, and F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise d'\u00c9tudes et de Sports Sous-Marins (FFESSM). PADI is also a registered training organisation in Australia. As of 2012, PADI rescue diver and divemaster programs are included on the United Kingdom's Health and Safety Executive list of approved diving qualifications.\nThose PADI courses aligning with standards published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for 'Recreational diving services' were audited by the European Underwater Federation (EUF) Certification Body in 2004 and 2009, and were certified at both times as complying with these standards.\nThe relevant certifications may include: \nMost PADI training programs are not directly covered by ISO standards.\nPADI is a member of the following member councils of the World Recreational Scuba Training Council \u2013 the RSTC Canada, the RSTC Europe and the C-Card Council (Japan).\nBusiness strategy.\nPADI is recognised as the largest recreational diver training agency with the largest rate of issue of diver certification, and the largest membership of professional instructors and dive leaders in recreational diving. They are a for-profit organization focused on efficiency of training of the largest number of customers.\nTo gain membership of PADI, a person must agree to follow PADI training standards, be reviewed by PADI for quality assurance, sign the membership agreement and pay the annual membership dues, for which they are allowed to buy PADI course materials, resell them to their customers, and use the PADI trademarks and logos for marketing their services.\nMarketing.\nPADI marketing puts an emphasis on convenience, fun and continued attendance on PADI courses. Risk management is largely by limitations on the certified diver's recommended range of acceptable environmental and equipment options and providing profitable additional training programs to extend these options by small increments.\nPADI offers dive shops and training centers the opportunity to affiliate with the PADI brand by becoming a member of the PADI Retailer and Resort Association (PADI RRA) which is a worldwide group of dive shops and resorts committed to selling PADI products and promoting the PADI diving and marketing philosophy. PADI Worldwide, Inc. contracts directly with member dive shops to join the RRA, and PADI Americas, Inc. administers the RRA in the United States.\nA PADI 5 Star Dive Center is a dive center that exclusively offers PADI training and certification, has been a PADI dive center for at least 12 months, with no verified violations of PADI quality assurance over that period and no open QA investigations, and have been awarded all three of PADI's dive center recognition awards (the criteria for which do not appear to be publicly available). The center must also advertise to recruit and retain customers. The center must have provided at least one course each of Advanced Open Water Diver, PADI Rescue Diver, and Divemaster or Assistant Instructor, in the previous year, and provide diving activities or travel apart from training. There is no mention or guarantee of better quality service compared to any other dive center.\nA PADI Elite Instructor is a PADI instructor with no verified QA violations who certifies more than a specified number of divers per year.\nQuality assurance.\nAccording to a statement by an attorney for PADI, PADI issues disclaimers on various documents, saying member shops are not agents of PADI, and PADI is no more than a professional organisation and certifying agency, and its members operate independently, and PADI is therefore not responsible for their actions or omissions.\nIn a civil case in Missoula, Montana, where PADI Open Water Diver Linnea Mills drowned during a PADI course where the PADI dive shop and PADI instructor allegedly contravened both PADI training standards, PADI business practices, and several other procedures generally considered safe recreational diving practice, PADI's argument that Gull Dive and their staff were neither its agents nor employees, and that it could not be held responsible for the death of a client of Gull Dive was overruled by a judge, who stated that PADI exerted control over Gull Dive and its instructors by way of its membership agreement, which obliged members to follow its standards and instructions.\nCriticisms.\nIn early 2024 PADI dive centers in Africa and the Middle East were prohibited from offering scuba diving training with certification from any agency other than PADI.\nSpecialty training.\nAdaptive Support Diver.\nAdaptive Support Diver is a course for divers who want to support a dive buddy with a physical or mental barrier to full independence as a recreational diver, and must rely on some support from one or more support divers for acceptable safety. The training is targeted on increasing the support diver's awareness of the challenged diver's abilities and limitations, and how to effectively assist in their management. Prerequisites are Open Water Diver, in date Emergency First Response primary and secondary care, and recommended PADI Peak Performance Buoyancy. The course covers diving with people with reduced mobility and supporting divers who are blind or have less obvious disabilities, and focuses on what disabled people can do, to help the support diver understand the use of adaptive techniques.\nAffiliates and sponsorships.\nSince 2009, PADI and the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) have maintained a mutual support partnership. In Canada, PADI sponsors the Scouts Canada Scuba Program. Affiliates include:\nCitations in professional literature.\nPADI's instructional methodology is cited in EDUCAUSE's 2012 book, \"Game Changers: Education and Information Technologies\" regarding badges as \"a symbol or indicator of an accomplishment, skill, quality, or interest. From the Boy and Girl Scouts to PADI diving instruction, to the more recently popular geolocation game Foursquare, badges have been successfully used to set goals, motivate behaviors, represent achievements, and communicate success in many contexts.\"\nPADI's environmental emphasis is cited in the 2007 book, \"New Frontiers in Marine Tourism\", in its section, Dive Tourism, Sustainable Tourism and Social Responsibility: A Growing Agenda \u2013 Environmental management and education: the case of PADI, (Chapter Seven). \"PADI, as well as other diver certification organisations and individual businesses, has put significant resources into conservation and developed public awareness programs\".\n\"New Frontiers in Marine Tourism\" also cites in the section entitled Student Scholarships and Social Responsibility: A Growing Agenda for PADI, that \"The PADI Scholarship program ... is a good example of the way that various disparate parts of an industry, each with limited resources, can pool their efforts to help more people from developing countries to enter the diving profession... PADI recognizes that good relations with the involvement of local people is essential both to business development and to environmental protection. The scholarship scheme makes entry into the dive business more possible for some students who have the backing of their dive center.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A stage, film, and television star, during her 60-year professional career, she was known for her strong, realistic screen presence and versatility. She was a favorite of directors, including Cecil B. DeMille, Fritz Lang, and Frank Capra, and made 86 films in 38 years before turning to television. She received numerous accolades, including three Primetime Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe Award, and was nominated for four Academy Awards. \nOrphaned at the age of four and partially raised in foster homes, she always worked. One of her directors, Jacques Tourneur, said of her, \"She only lives for two things, and both of them are work.\" She made her debut on stage in the chorus as a Ziegfeld girl in 1923 at age 16, and within a few years was acting in plays. Her first lead role, which was in the hit \"Burlesque\" (1927), established her as a Broadway star. In 1929, she transitioned from the stage to the film industry, and began acting in talking pictures. Frank Capra chose her for his romantic drama \"Ladies of Leisure\" (1930), and Stanwyck later became a favorite of Capra\u2019s, leading to another three collaborations. This led to additional leading roles which raised her profile, such as \"Night Nurse\" (1931), \"Baby Face\" (1933), the controversial \"The Bitter Tea of General Yen\" (1933), and \"Gambling Lady\" (1934). \nBy the late 1930s, Stanwyck had moved to more mature roles in critically and commercially successful comedies and dramas. For her performance as the titular character in \"Stella Dallas\" (1937), she earned her first Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. In 1941, she starred in two screwball comedies: \"Ball of Fire\" with Gary Cooper, and \"The Lady Eve\" with Henry Fonda. She received her second Academy Award nomination for \"Ball of Fire\", and in the decades since its release, \"The Lady Eve\" has come to be regarded as a comedic classic, with Stanwyck's performance widely hailed as one of the best in American comedy. Other successful films during this period are \"Remember the Night\" (1940), \"Meet John Doe\" (1940) and \"You Belong to Me\" (1941), reteaming her with Cooper and Fonda, respectively, \"The Gay Sisters\" (1942), and \"Lady of Burlesque\" (1943). \nBy 1944, Stanwyck had become the highest-paid actress in the United States. That year, she received a third Academy Award nomination for Best Actress in the film noir \"Double Indemnity\", playing a wife who persuades an insurance salesman to kill her husband. In 1945, she played a homemaker columnist in the holiday classic \"Christmas in Connecticut,\" and the following year, starred as the titular femme fatale in \"The Strange Love of Martha Ivers.\" For the remainder of the decade, Stanwyck starred in additional successes ranging from romantic dramas and comedies, to suspenseful, crime-noirs. Her films during this period include \"My Reputation\" (1946), \"The Two Mrs. Carrolls\" (1947), \"Sorry, Wrong Number\" (1948), for which she received her fourth and final Academy Award nomination, and \"East Side, West Side\" (1949). By the early 1950s, Stanwyck\u2019s career began to decline, despite a fair number of leading and major supporting roles, the most successful being \"Clash by Night\" (1952), \"Jeopardy\" (1953), and \"Executive Suite\" (1954). In the 1960s, Stanwyck had made a successful transition to television, where she won three Emmy Awards, for \"The Barbara Stanwyck Show\" (1961), the Western series \"The Big Valley\" (1966), and the miniseries \"The Thorn Birds\" (1983).\nShe received an Honorary Oscar in 1982, the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1986, and several other honorary lifetime awards. In 1999 she is ranked as the 11th-greatest female star of classic American cinema by the American Film Institute.\nEarly life.\nStanwyck was born Ruby Catherine Stevens on July 16, 1907, in Brooklyn, New York. She was the fifth and youngest child of Kathryn Ann \"Kitty\" (n\u00e9e McPhee) and Byron E. Stevens. Both parents' families had been in North America since the 1740s. Byron, of English descent, was a native of Lanesville, Massachusetts, where his father was a significant landowner. He had aimed to become a lawyer, but had dropped out of college in favor of work after his father's death, eventually becoming a bricklayer and stonesetter. Stanwyck's mother Kitty was a Canadian immigrant of Scottish-Irish descent from Sydney, Nova Scotia. They had met when Kitty was visiting family in Boston.\nStanwyck had three older sisters, Laura Mildred (called Millie, b. 1886), Viola Maud (b. 1889) and Mabel (b. 1890), and one older brother, Malcolm Byron (b. 1905). The family had relocated from New England to Flatbush, Brooklyn the year before Stanwyck was born in search of better work opportunities for Byron. In July 1911, four-year-old Stanwyck and her six-year-old brother were riding a streetcar with their mother when a drunk passenger fell and pushed the mother off the vehicle. Kitty Stevens was heavily pregnant at the time, and the accident induced early labor, which caused fatal sepsis. Byron Stevens' alcoholism worsened after his wife's death, and he left the family soon after. He joined a work crew digging the Panama Canal in 1912, dying there some years later in an epidemic.\nStanwyck's sisters were already adults when their mother died, but while they stayed closely involved in their younger siblings' lives, they could not take care of them full-time. In the years following the disintegration of their family, Stanwyck and her brother lived in a series of unofficial foster homes (mostly friends of the family) in Flatbush. As the foster homes could only accommodate one child at a time, the siblings were separated, which caused them additional distress. Around 1919, Stanwyck and her brother moved in with their older sister Viola Maud and her family.\nStanwyck attended Public School 152 in Brooklyn. She hated school with the exception of literature, and received generally poor grades. She was bullied and routinely picked fights with the other students. Stanwyck started to dream about entering show business in childhood. Her sister Millie had become a successful vaudeville dancer and took Stanwyck with her on summer tours. She also idolized film star Pearl White, whose serial \"The Perils of Pauline\" (1914) was popular at the time. As a teenager, Stanwyck began performing in amateur theater and in shows at film theaters in Flatbush. \nAfter graduating from P.S. 152, Stanwyck decided to not attend high school. Starting at 14, she took a series of customer-service and secretarial positions, which allowed her to gain financial independence while pursuing her goal of becoming a celebrated dancer.\nCareer.\nZiegfeld girl and Broadway success.\nIn 1923, a few months before her 16th birthday, Stanwyck auditioned for a place in the chorus at the Strand Roof, a nightclub over the Strand Theatre in Times Square. A few months later, she obtained a job as a dancer in the 1922 and 1923 seasons of the \"Ziegfeld Follies\", dancing at the New Amsterdam Theater. For the next several years, she worked as a chorus girl, performing from midnight to seven in the morning at nightclubs owned by Texas Guinan. She also occasionally served as a dance instructor at a speakeasy for gays and lesbians owned by Guinan. One of her good friends during those years was pianist Oscar Levant, who described her as being \"wary of sophisticates and phonies\".\nBilly LaHiff, who owned a popular pub frequented by show people, introduced Stanwyck in 1926 to impresario Willard Mack, who was casting his play \"The Noose\". Stanwyck successfully auditioned for the part of the chorus girl. As initially staged, the play was not a success. In an effort to improve it, Mack decided to expand Stanwyck's part to include more pathos. \"The Noose\" reopened in October 1926, and became one of the most successful plays of the season, running on Broadway for nine months and 198 performances. At the suggestion of David Belasco, Stanwyck changed her name to Barbara Stanwyck by combining the first name of the title character in the play \"Barbara Frietchie\" with the last name of the actress in the play, Jane Stanwyck; both were found on a 1906 theater program.\nStanwyck had her first leading role in \"Burlesque\" (1927), which was a critical and commercial success. Its producer Arthur Hopkins later described casting her because she had \"a sort of rough poignancy. She at once displayed more sensitive, easily expressed emotion than I had encountered since Pauline Lord.\" The same year, Stanwyck made her first film appearance as a fan dancer in \"Broadway Nights\" (1927). While playing in \"Burlesque\", Stanwyck had begun a relationship with actor Frank Fay. Soon after marrying on August 26, 1928, the couple moved to Los Angeles, where Stanwyck hoped to pursue a career in films.\nFilm career.\nStanwyck's first sound film was \"The Locked Door\" (1929), followed by \"Mexicali Rose\", released in the same year. Neither film was successful; nonetheless, Frank Capra chose Stanwyck for his film \"Ladies of Leisure\" (1930). Her work in that production established an enduring friendship with the director and led to future roles in his films. Other prominent roles followed, among them as a nurse who saves two little girls from the villainous chauffeur (Clark Gable) in \"Night Nurse\" (1931). In Edna Ferber's novel brought to screen by William Wellman, she portrays small-town teacher and valiant Midwest farm woman Selena in \"So Big!\" (1932). She followed with a performance as an ambitious woman sleeping her way to the top from \"the wrong side of the tracks\" in \"Baby Face\" (1933), a controversial pre-code thriller. In \"The Bitter Tea of General Yen\" (1933), another controversial pre-code film by director Capra, Stanwyck portrays an idealistic Christian caught behind the lines of the Chinese Civil War kidnapped by warlord Nils Asther. A flop at the time, though it received some critical success, the lavish film is \"dark stuff, and it's difficult to imagine another actress handling this\u00a0... philosophical conversion as fearlessly as Ms. Stanwyck does. She doesn't make heavy weather of it.\"\nRegarding her pre-code work, Mick LaSalle, movie critic for the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", said, \"If you've never seen Stanwyck in a pre-code film, you've never seen Stanwyck. [The code began to be enforced seriously beginning in July 1934.] Never in her career, including \"Double Indemnity\", was she ever as hard-boiled as she was in the early 1930s. She had a wonderful quality of being both incredibly cool and yet blazingly passionate. Her cynicism was profound, and then, without warning, she would explode into shrieking, sobbing.\"\nIn \"Stella Dallas\" (1937), she plays the self-sacrificing title character who eventually allows her teenaged daughter to live a better life somewhere else. She landed her first Academy Award nomination for Best Actress when she was able to portray her character as vulgar, yet sympathetic, as required by the movie. Next, she played Molly Monahan in \"Union Pacific\" (1939) with Joel McCrea. Stanwyck was reportedly one of the many actresses considered for the role of Scarlett O'Hara in \"Gone with the Wind\" (1939), although she did not receive a screen test. In \"Meet John Doe\", she plays an ambitious newspaperwoman with Gary Cooper (1941).\nIn Preston Sturges's romantic comedy \"The Lady Eve\" (1941), she plays a slinky, sophisticated confidence woman who \"gives off an erotic charge that would straighten a boa constrictor\", while falling in love with her intended mark, a guileless, wealthy herpetologist, played by Henry Fonda. Film critic David Thomson described Stanwyck as \"giving one of the best American comedy performances\", and she was reviewed as brilliantly versatile in \"her bravura double performance\" by \"The Guardian\". \"The Lady Eve\" is among the top 100 movies of all time on \"Time\" and \"Entertainment Weekly's\" lists, and is considered to be both a great comedy and a great romantic film with its placement at #55 on the AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs list and #26 on its 100 Years...100 Passions list.\nNext, she was the extremely successful, independent doctor Helen Hunt in \"You Belong to Me\" (1941), also with Fonda. Stanwyck then played nightclub performer Sugarpuss O'Shea in the Howard Hawks-directed, but Billy Wilder-written comedy \"Ball of Fire\" (1941). In this update of the Snow White and Seven Dwarfs tale, she gives professor Bertram Potts (played by Gary Cooper) a better understanding of \"modern English\" in the performance for which she received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress.\n\"That is the kind of woman that makes whole civilizations topple.\" -- Kathleen Howard of Stanwyck's character in \"Ball of Fire\".\nIn \"Double Indemnity\" (1944), the seminal film noir thriller directed by Billy Wilder, she plays Phyllis Dietrichson, who lures an infatuated insurance salesman (Fred MacMurray), into killing her husband. Stanwyck was critically hailed for bringing out the cruel nature of the \"grim, unflinching murderess\", marking her as the \"most notorious \"femme fatale\"\" in the film noir genre. \"Double Indemnity\" is usually considered to be among the top 100 films of all time, though it did not win any of its seven Academy Award nominations. It is the number 38 film of all time on the American Film Institute's list, as well as the number 24 on its 100 Years...100 Thrills list and number 84 on its 100 Years...100 Passions list.\nShe plays a columnist touted as the \"greatest cook in the country\" caught up in white lies while trying to pursue a romance in the comedy \"Christmas in Connecticut\" (1945). It was a hit upon release and remains a treasured holiday classic today. In 1946, she was \"liquid nitrogen\" as Martha, a manipulative murderess, starring with Van Heflin and newcomer Kirk Douglas in \"The Strange Love of Martha Ivers\". Stanwyck was also the vulnerable, invalid wife who overhears her own murder being plotted in \"Sorry, Wrong Number\" (1948) and the doomed concert pianist in \"The Other Love\" (1947). In the latter film's soundtrack, the piano music is actually being performed by Ania Dorfmann, who drilled Stanwyck for three hours a day until the actress was able to synchronize the motion of her arms and hands to match the music's tempo, giving a convincing impression that Stanwyck is playing the piano.\nPauline Kael, a longtime film critic for \"The New Yorker\", admired the natural appearance of Stanwyck's acting style on screen, noting that she \"seems to have an intuitive understanding of the fluid physical movements that work best on camera\". In reference to the actress's film work during the early sound era, Kael observed that the \"[e]arly talkies sentimentality\u00a0... only emphasizes Stanwyck's remarkable modernism.\"\nStanwyck was known for her accessibility and kindness to the backstage crew on any film set. She knew the names of many of their wives and children. Frank Capra said of Stanwyck: \"She was destined to be beloved by all directors, actors, crews and extras. In a Hollywood popularity contest, she would win first prize, hands down.\" While working on 1954's \"Cattle Queen of Montana\" (also starring Ronald Reagan) on location in Glacier National Park, she performed some of her own stunts, including a swim in the icy lake. At the age of 50, she performed an extremely difficult stunt in \"Forty Guns\". The scene called for her character to fall from and be dragged by a horse, and the stunt was so dangerous that the film's professional stuntman refused to perform it. She was later named an honorary member of the Hollywood Stuntmen's Hall of Fame.\nWilliam Holden and Stanwyck were longtime friends, and when they were presenting the Best Sound Oscar for 1977, he paused to pay a special tribute to her for saving his career when Holden was cast in the lead for \"Golden Boy\" (1939). After a series of unsteady daily performances, he was about to be fired, but Stanwyck staunchly defended him, successfully standing up to the film producers. Shortly after Holden's death, Stanwyck recalled the moment when receiving her honorary Oscar: \"A few years ago, I stood on this stage with William Holden as a presenter. I loved him very much, and I miss him. He always wished that I would get an Oscar. And so, tonight, my golden boy, you got your wish.\"\nTelevision career.\nAs Stanwyck's film career declined during the 1950s, she moved to television. In 1958, she guest-starred in \"Trail to Nowhere\", an episode of the Western anthology series \"Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre\", playing a wife who kills a man to avenge her husband. In 1961, she hosted an anthology drama series titled \"The Barbara Stanwyck Show\" that was not a ratings success, but earned her an Emmy Award. The show ran for a total of 36 episodes. During this period, she also guest-starred on other television series, such as \"The Untouchables\" and four episodes of \"Wagon Train\".\nShe stepped back into film for the 1964 Elvis Presley film \"Roustabout\", in which she plays a carnival owner.\n \nThe Western television series \"The Big Valley\", which was broadcast on ABC from 1965 to 1969, made Stanwyck one of the most popular actresses on television, winning her another Emmy. She was billed in the series' opening credits as Miss Barbara Stanwyck for her role as Victoria, the widowed matriarch of the wealthy Barkley family.\nIn 1983, Stanwyck won an Emmy for \"The Thorn Birds\", her third such award. In 1985, she made three guest appearances in the primetime soap opera \"Dynasty\" prior to the launch of its short-lived spinoff series \"The Colbys\", in which she starred alongside Charlton Heston, Stephanie Beacham, and Katharine Ross. Unhappy with the experience, Stanwyck remained with the series for only the first season, and her role as Constance Colby Patterson was her last. Earl Hamner Jr., former producer of \"The Waltons\", was rumored to have initially wanted Stanwyck for the role of Angela Channing in the 1980s soap opera \"Falcon Crest\", and she turned it down, with the role going to her friend Jane Wyman, but Hamner assured Wyman that it was only a rumor.\nPersonal life.\nMarriages and relationships.\nWhile playing in \"The Noose\", Stanwyck reportedly fell in love with her married co-star Rex Cherryman. When Cherryman took ill in early 1928, his doctor advised him to take a sea voyage, so Cherryman set sail for Le Havre intending to continue on to Paris, where Stanwyck and he had arranged to meet. While at sea, he contracted septic poisoning and died shortly after arriving in France at the age of 31.\nOn August 26, 1928, Stanwyck married her \"Burlesque\" co-star Frank Fay. Fay and she later claimed that they had disliked each other at first, but became close after Cherryman's death. Fay was Catholic, so Stanwyck converted for their marriage. She was reportedly unable to have children, and one biographer alleges the cause of her infertility was a botched abortion at the age of 15 that resulted in complications. After moving to Hollywood, the couple adopted a boy. The marriage was troubled; Fay's successful Broadway career did not translate to the big screen, whereas Stanwyck achieved Hollywood stardom. Fay was reportedly physically abusive to Stanwyck, especially when he was inebriated. Some claim that the marriage was the basis for dialogue written by William Wellman, a friend of the couple's, for \"A Star Is Born\" (1937) starring Janet Gaynor and Fredric March. The couple divorced on December 30, 1935. Stanwyck won custody of their son, whom she raised with a strict, authoritarian hand and demanding expectations. Stanwyck and her son became estranged after his childhood, meeting only a few times after he became an adult. Wrote Richard Corliss, the child \"resembled her in just one respect: both were, effectively, orphans.\"\nIn 1936, while making the film \"His Brother's Wife\" (1936), Stanwyck became involved with her co-star, Robert Taylor. Rather than a torrid romance, their relationship was more one of mentor and pupil. Stanwyck served as support and adviser to the younger Taylor, who had come from a small Nebraska town; she guided his career and acclimated him to the sophisticated Hollywood culture. The couple began living together, sparking newspaper reports. Stanwyck was hesitant to remarry after the failure of her first marriage, but their 1939 marriage was arranged with the help of Taylor's studio, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, a common practice in Hollywood's golden age. Louis B. Mayer had insisted that Stanwyck and Taylor marry and went as far as presiding over arrangements at the wedding. Stanwyck and Taylor enjoyed time together outdoors during the early years of their marriage and owned acres of prime West Los Angeles property. Their large ranch and home in the Mandeville Canyon section of Brentwood, Los Angeles, is still referred to by the locals as \"the old Robert Taylor ranch\".\nStanwyck and Taylor decided in 1950 to divorce, and at his insistence, she proceeded with the official filing of the papers. Many rumors exist regarding the cause of the divorce, but after World War II, Taylor attempted to create a life away from the entertainment industry, and Stanwyck did not share that goal. Taylor allegedly had extramarital affairs, and unsubstantiated rumors suggested that Stanwyck had, also. After the divorce, they remained friendly and acted together in Stanwyck's last feature film, \"The Night Walker\" (1964). She never remarried. According to her friend and \"Big Valley\" co-star Linda Evans, Stanwyck cited Taylor as the love of her life. She took his death in 1969 very hard, and took a long break from film and television work.\nStanwyck was one of the best-liked actresses in Hollywood and maintained friendships with many of her fellow actors (as well as crew members of her films and TV shows), including Joel McCrea and his wife Frances Dee, George Brent, Robert Preston, Henry Fonda (who had a longtime crush on her), James Stewart, Linda Evans, Joan Crawford, Jack Benny and his wife Mary Livingstone, William Holden, Gary Cooper, and Fred MacMurray. During filming of \"To Please a Lady\", Stanwyck refused to leave her African-American maid Harriet Coray in a hotel only for African-American people and insisted that Harriet stay in the same hotel as she did. After much pressure from Stanwyck, Coray was allowed to stay in the best hotel in Indianapolis with Stanwyck and the rest of the cast and crew.\nStanwyck, at age 45, had a four-year romantic affair with 22-year-old actor Robert Wagner that had begun on the set of \"Titanic\" (1953) before Stanwyck ended the relationship. The affair is described in Wagner's 2008 memoir \"Pieces of My Heart:\" \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Barbara and I were together for four years. What ultimately broke it up was the fact that it couldn\u2019t go anywhere\u2014it was a classic backstreet romance. I was going on location to make movies, she was going on location to make movies, and there was no chance of a marriage in that place and time, so it was bound to run out of steam. She finally sat me down and told me that it was too difficult for her. She loved me, but\u2026.\nI couldn\u2019t argue with her reasoning. There was simply no way we could have been married at that time. I would have always been Mr. Stanwyck, and we both knew it.\nAnd that\u2019s how it came to an end.\nPolitical views.\nA conservative Republican, Stanwyck opposed the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt. She felt that if someone from her disadvantaged background had risen to success, others should be able to prosper without government intervention or assistance. For Stanwyck, \"hard work with the prospect of rich reward was the American way.\" She became an early member of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals (MPA) after its founding in 1944. The mission of this group was to \"combat\u00a0... subversive methods [used in the industry] to undermine and change the American way of life.\" It opposed communist influences in Hollywood. She publicly supported the investigations of the House Un-American Activities Committee, and her husband Robert Taylor testified as a friendly witness. Stanwyck supported Thomas E. Dewey in the 1944 and 1948 United States presidential elections.\nA fan of Objectivist author Ayn Rand, Stanwyck persuaded Warner Bros. head Jack L. Warner to purchase the rights to \"The Fountainhead\" before it became a bestseller, and she wrote to Rand of her admiration of \"Atlas Shrugged\".\nReligion.\nStanwyck was originally a Protestant, and was baptized in June 1916 by the Reverend J. Frederic Berg of the Protestant Dutch Reformed Church. She converted to Roman Catholicism when she married first husband Frank Fay, but does not appear to have remained an adherent after the marriage ended.\nBrother.\nStanwyck's older brother, Malcolm Byron Stevens (1905\u20131964), became an actor, using the name Bert Stevens. He appeared mostly in supporting roles, often uncredited. He appeared in two films that starred Stanwyck: \"The File on Thelma Jordon\" and \"No Man of Her Own\", both released in 1950. He appeared in two episodes of \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\": (season six, episode eight (1960): \"O Youth and Beauty!\" as uncredited Club Member) and (season seven, episode 21 (1962): \"Burglar Proof\" as uncredited Demonstration Guest). He also appeared in one episode of \"The Alfred Hitchcock Hour\": (season two, episode 25 (1964): \"The Ordeal of Mrs. Snow\" as uncredited Carl the Butler).\nLater years and death.\nStanwyck's retirement years were active, with charity work outside the limelight.\nIn 1981, in her home in the exclusive Trousdale section of Beverly Hills, she was awakened during the night by an intruder who struck her on the head with his flashlight, forced her into a closet, and absconded with $40,000 in jewelry.\nIn 1982, while filming \"The Thorn Birds\", Stanwyck inhaled special-effects smoke on the set that may have caused her to contract bronchitis, which was compounded by her cigarette-smoking habit. She began smoking at the age of nine and stopped just four years before her death.\nStanwyck died on January 20, 1990, at the age of 82, from congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California. She had indicated that she wanted no funeral service. In accordance with her wishes, her remains were cremated and the ashes scattered from a helicopter over Lone Pine, California, where she had made some of her Western films.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was originally defined by the International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT, now ITU-T) in a series of drafts and finalized in a publication known as \"The Orange Book\" in 1976. \nThe protocol suite is designed as three conceptual layers, which correspond closely to the lower three layers of the seven-layer OSI Reference Model, although it was developed several years before the OSI model (1984). It also supports functionality not found in the OSI network layer. An X.25 WAN consists of packet-switching exchange (PSE) nodes as the networking hardware, and leased lines, plain old telephone service connections, or ISDN connections as physical links. \nX.25 was popular with telecommunications companies for their public data networks from the late 1970s to 1990s, which provided worldwide coverage. It was also used in financial transaction systems, such as automated teller machines, and by the credit card payment industry. However, most users have since moved to the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP). X.25 is still used, for example by the aviation industry.\nHistory.\nThe CCITT (later ITU-T), the organization responsible for international standardization of telecom services, began developing a standard for packet-switched data communication in the mid-1970s based upon a number of emerging data network projects. Participants in the design of X.25 included engineers from Canada, France, Japan, the UK, and the USA representing a mix of national PTTs (France, Japan, UK) and private operators (Canada, USA). In particular, the work of R\u00e9mi Despr\u00e9s, contributed significantly to the standard, which was based on a virtual circuit service. A few minor changes, which complemented the proposed specification, were accommodated to enable Larry Roberts to join the agreement. Various updates and additions were worked into the standard, eventually recorded in the ITU series of technical books describing the telecommunication systems. These books were published every fourth year with different-colored covers. The X.25 specification is part of the larger set of X-Series.\nHow the CCITT standardized virtual circuits.\nThe CCITT appointed a special Rapporteur on packet switching, Halvor Bothner-By, who held an initial meeting in January 1974. This resulted in a question, to be answered by study group (SG) VII for the next CCITT plenary in 1976, which was \u201cShould the packet-mode of operation be provided on public data networks and, if so, how should it be implemented?\u201d. A list of packet switching networks \u201cto be considered\u201d was provided: ARPANET (of the ARPA in the USA), EIN (of the European COST), EPSS (of the British Post Office Telecommunications),RCP (of the French PTT), CYCLADES (of IRIA in France), the NPL network (of the NPL in the UK), the SWIFT network (of the international SWIFT society), and the SITA network (of the international SITA company).\nThe second Rapporteur meeting, hosted in Oslo by the Norwegian Telecommunications Administration in November 1974, gathered 24 participants, including representatives of other international organizations (ISO, IFIP, ECMA). A document submitted by France \u201cwith the active support of a number of European administrations\u201d served as \u201cmain basis for discussion in this meeting\u201d. It was then \u201cagreed that two types of services should be considered, a \u2018datagram\u2019 service and a \u2018virtual call\u2019 service\u201d.p3\nAt the third meeting, focus had moved from whether there should be packet-mode networks to whether there could be \u201ca standard for the interface between the network and the computers\u201d.p39\nStarting in January 1975, several bilateral and multilateral meetings took place between network operators having commitments for a packet switching service, in view to draft a common interface specification. Meetings started between the Canadian DATAPAC and the French TRANSPAC, continued with the startup Telenet of the USA, and continued with the BPO of the UK.p39p44\nIn March 1975, Halvor Bothner-By produced a list of recommendations to be created, or simply updated, for a packet switching standard to become possible. It was used as a framework at a drafting meeting in Ottawa between engineers of the four operators wishing to have a standard as soon as possible in the USA, Canada, France, UK and Japan. They prepared contributions to be submitted to SG VII in their name by administrations having voting right in CCITT. One contribution was a X.2x interface specification, the first version of what will become X.25).\nThe fourth Rapporteur meeting, in May 1975 in Geneva, had 45 participants and 27 new documents. The Rapporteur asked whether packet switching recommendations should be issued \"with a view to making international interworking possible\u201d, \"the French administration answered in the affirmative and Canada strongly supported the French proposal\". No firm conclusion was however obtained yet.\nThe fifth Rapporteur meeting, in September 1975 in Geneva, had about 60 participants. After discussions on the proposed virtual circuit interface, numerous issues were left unresolved.p40 Concerning datagrams, \u2018It was proposed by Larry Roberts of the US delegation and supported by representatives from France and Canada respectively that the datagram classification be changed from \u201cE\u201d to \u201cA\u201d\u2019, i.e., from essential \"to be available internationally\u201d to additional that \"may be available in certain countries and internationally\u201d. The Rapporteur's last report expressed doubts \u201cthat a standard would be ready for adoption by SG VII\u201d.p40\nAt the last meeting of the full SG VII before the CCITT plenary of September 1976, the available draft X.25 raised numerous clarification questions and/or and technical objections. SG VII's chairman Vern MacDonald appointed an editor and provided a meeting facility for the weekend. After intense work during it, all issues had been dealt with. For an approval by the full study group, a challenge remained: copies of the updated X.25 draft had to be available in two languages. To get them in due time, Tony Rybczynski of DATAPAC and Paul Guinaudeau of TRANSPAC spent a full night to handwrite all negotiated amendments, and to assemble them with paste and scissors into clean documents. COM VII then reviewed distributed copies, and unanimously approved them for submission to the forthcoming CCITT plenary. At this plenary of September 1976, the X.25 recommendation and the other 10 of SG VII were unanimously approved.p40\nAs requested by the USA, an optional datagram service was added to the revised X.25 of 1980, together with an alignment of its link layer, now called LAPB, with a recent evolution of HDLC in ISO. In absence of any public network operator implementing this option, datagrams were finally deleted from X.25 in its update of 1984.p41\nWorldwide public data networks.\nPublicly accessible X.25 networks, commonly called public data networks, were set up in many countries during the late 1970s and 1980s to lower the cost of accessing various online services. Examples include Iberpac, TRANSPAC, Compuserve, Tymnet, Telenet, Euronet, PSS, Datapac, Datanet 1 and AUSTPAC as well as the International Packet Switched Service. Their combined network had large global coverage during the 1980s and into the 1990s.\nBeginning in the early 1990s, in North America, use of X.25 networks (predominated by Telenet and Tymnet) started to be replaced by Frame Relay services offered by national telephone companies. Most systems that required X.25 now use TCP/IP, however it is possible to transport X.25 over TCP/IP when necessary.\nX.25 networks are still in use throughout the world. A variant called AX.25 is used widely by amateur packet radio. Racal Paknet, now known as Widanet, remains in operation in many regions of the world, running on an X.25 protocol base. In some countries, like the Netherlands or Germany, it is possible to use a stripped version of X.25 via the D-channel of an ISDN-2 (or ISDN BRI) connection for low-volume applications such as point-of-sale terminals; but, the future of this service in the Netherlands is uncertain.\nX.25 is still used in the aeronautical business (especially in Asia) even though a transition to modern protocols is increasingly important as X.25 hardware becomes increasingly rare and costly. As recently as March 2006, the United States National Airspace Data Interchange Network has used X.25 to interconnect remote airfields with air route traffic control centers.\nFrance was one of the last remaining countries where commercial end-user service based on X.25 operated. Known as Minitel it was based on Videotex, itself running on X.25. In 2002, Minitel had about 9 million users, and in 2011 it accounted for about 2 million users in France when France T\u00e9l\u00e9com announced it would shut down the service by 30 June 2012. As planned, service was terminated 30 June 2012. There were 800,000 terminals in operation at the time. An X.25 service was still purchasable from BT in the United Kingdom in 2019.\nArchitecture.\nThe general concept of the X.25 was to create a universal and global packet-switched network. Much of the X.25 system is a description of the rigorous error correction needed to achieve this, as well as more efficient sharing of capital-intensive physical resources.\nThe X.25 specification defines only the interface between a subscriber (DTE) and an X.25 network (DCE). X.75, a protocol very similar to X.25, defines the interface between two X.25 networks to allow connections to traverse two or more networks. X.25 does not specify how the network operates internally\u00a0\u2013 many X.25 network implementations used something very similar to X.25 or X.75 internally, but others used quite different protocols internally. The ISO protocol equivalent to X.25, ISO 8208, is compatible with X.25, but additionally includes provision for two X.25 DTEs to be directly connected to each other with no network in between. By separating the Packet-Layer Protocol, ISO 8208 permits operation over additional networks such as ISO 8802 LLC2 (ISO LAN) and the OSI data link layer.\nX.25 originally defined three basic protocol levels or architectural layers. In the original specifications these were referred to as \"levels\" and also had a level number, whereas all ITU-T X.25 recommendations and ISO 8208 standards released after 1984 refer to them as \"layers\". The layer numbers were dropped to avoid confusion with the OSI Model layers.\nThe X.25 model was based on the traditional telephony concept of establishing reliable circuits through a shared network, but using software to create \"virtual calls\" through the network. These calls interconnect \"data terminal equipment\" (DTE) providing endpoints to users, which looked like point-to-point connections. Each endpoint can establish many separate virtual calls to different endpoints.\nFor a brief period, the specification also included a connectionless datagram service, but this was dropped in the next revision. The \"fast select with restricted response facility\" is intermediate between full call establishment and connectionless communication. It is widely used in query-response transaction applications involving a single request and response limited to 128 bytes of data carried each way. The data is carried in an extended call request packet and the response is carried in an extended field of the call reject packet, with a connection never being fully established.\nClosely related to the X.25 protocol are the protocols to connect asynchronous devices (such as dumb terminals and printers) to an X.25 network: X.3, X.28 and X.29. This functionality was performed using a packet assembler/disassembler or PAD (also known as a \"triple-X device\", referring to the three protocols used).\nRelation to the OSI Reference Model.\nAlthough X.25 predates the OSI Reference Model (OSIRM), the physical layer of the OSI model corresponds to the X.25 \"physical layer\", the data link layer to the X.25 \"data link layer\", and the network layer to the X.25 \"packet layer\". The X.25 \"data link layer\", LAPB, provides a reliable data path across a data link (or multiple parallel data links, multilink) which may not be reliable itself. The X.25 \"packet layer\" provides the virtual call mechanisms, running over X.25 LAPB. The \"packet layer\" includes mechanisms to maintain virtual calls and to signal data errors in the event that the \"data link layer\" cannot recover from data transmission errors. All but the earliest versions of X.25 include facilities which provide for OSI network layer Addressing (NSAP addressing, see below).\nUser device support.\nX.25 was developed in the era of computer terminals connecting to host computers, although it also can be used for communications between computers. Instead of dialing directly \u201cinto\u201d the host computer\u00a0\u2013 which would require the host to have its own pool of modems and phone lines, and require non-local callers to make long-distance calls\u00a0\u2013 the host could have an X.25 connection to a network service provider. Now dumb-terminal users could dial into the network's local \u201cPAD\u201d (packet assembly/disassembly facility), a gateway device connecting modems and serial lines to the X.25 link as defined by the X.29 and X.3 standards.\nHaving connected to the PAD, the dumb-terminal user tells the PAD which host to connect to, by giving a phone-number-like address in the X.121 address format (or by giving a host name, if the service provider allows for names that map to X.121 addresses). The PAD then places an X.25 call to the host, establishing a virtual call. Note that X.25 provides for virtual calls, so \"appears\" to be a circuit switched network, even though in fact the data itself is packet switched internally, similar to the way TCP provides connections even though the underlying data is packet switched. Two X.25 hosts could, of course, call one another directly; no PAD is involved in this case. In theory, it doesn't matter whether the X.25 caller and X.25 destination are both connected to the same carrier, but in practice it was not always possible to make calls from one carrier to another.\nFor the purpose of flow-control, a sliding window protocol is used with the default window size of 2. The acknowledgements may have either local or end to end significance. A D bit (Data Delivery bit) in each data packet indicates if the sender requires end to end acknowledgement. When D=1, it means that the acknowledgement has end to end significance and must take place only after the remote DTE has acknowledged receipt of the data. When D=0, the network is permitted (but not required) to acknowledge before the remote DTE has acknowledged or even received the data.\nWhile the PAD function defined by X.28 and X.29 specifically supported asynchronous character terminals, PAD equivalents were developed to support a wide range of proprietary intelligent communications devices, such as those for IBM System Network Architecture (SNA).\nError control.\nError recovery procedures at the packet layer assume that the data link layer is responsible for retransmitting data received in error. Packet layer error handling focuses on resynchronizing the information flow in calls, as well as clearing calls that have gone into unrecoverable states:\nAddressing and virtual circuits.\nX.25 supports two types of virtual circuits; virtual calls (VC) and permanent virtual circuits (PVC). Virtual calls are established on an as-needed basis. For example, a VC is established when a call is placed and torn down after the call is complete. VCs are established through a call establishment and clearing procedure. On the other hand, permanent virtual circuits are preconfigured into the network. PVCs are seldom torn down and thus provide a dedicated connection between end points.\nVC may be established using X.121 addresses. The X.121 address consists of a three-digit data country code (DCC) plus a network digit, together forming the four-digit data network identification code (DNIC), followed by the national terminal number (NTN) of at most ten digits. Note the use of a single network digit, seemingly allowing for only 10 network carriers per country, but some countries are assigned more than one DCC to avoid this limitation. Networks often used fewer than the full NTN digits for routing, and made the spare digits available to the subscriber (sometimes called the sub-address) where they could be used to identify applications or for further routing on the subscribers networks.\nNSAP addressing facility was added in the X.25 (1984) revision of the specification, and this enabled X.25 to better meet the requirements of OSI Connection Oriented Network Service (CONS). Public X.25 networks were not required to make use of NSAP addressing, but, to support OSI CONS, were required to carry the NSAP addresses and other ITU-T specified DTE facilities transparently from DTE to DTE. Later revisions allowed multiple addresses in addition to X.121 addresses to be carried on the same DTE-DCE interface: Telex addressing (F.69), PSTN addressing (E.163), ISDN addressing (E.164), Internet Protocol addresses (IANA ICP), and local IEEE 802.2 MAC addresses.\nPVCs are permanently established in the network and therefore do not require the use of addresses for call setup. PVCs are identified at the subscriber interface by their logical channel identifier (see below). However, in practice not many of the national X.25 networks supported PVCs.\nOne DTE-DCE interface to an X.25 network has a maximum of 4095 logical channels on which it is allowed to establish virtual calls and permanent virtual circuits, although networks are not expected to support a full 4095 virtual circuits. For identifying the channel to which a packet is associated, each packet contains a 12 bit logical channel identifier made up of an 8-bit logical channel number and a 4-bit logical channel group number. Logical channel identifiers remain assigned to a virtual circuit for the duration of the connection. Logical channel identifiers identify a specific logical channel between the DTE (subscriber appliance) and the DCE (network), and only has local significance on the link between the subscriber and the network. The other end of the connection at the remote DTE is likely to have assigned a different logical channel identifier. The range of possible logical channels is split into 4 groups: channels assigned to permanent virtual circuits, assigned to incoming virtual calls, two-way (incoming or outgoing) virtual calls, and outgoing virtual calls. (Directions refer to the direction of virtual call initiation as viewed by the DTE\u00a0\u2013 they all carry data in both directions.) The ranges allowed a subscriber to be configured to handle significantly differing numbers of calls in each direction while reserving some channels for calls in one direction. All international networks are required to implement support for permanent virtual circuits, two-way logical channels and one-way logical channels outgoing; one-way logical channels incoming is an additional optional facility. DTE-DCE interfaces are not required to support more than one logical channel. Logical channel identifier zero will not be assigned to a permanent virtual circuit or virtual call. The logical channel identifier of zero is used for packets which don't relate to a specific virtual circuit (e.g. packet layer restart, registration, and diagnostic packets).\nBilling.\nIn public networks, X.25 was typically billed as a flat monthly service fee depending on link speed, and then a price-per-segment on top of this. Link speeds varied, typically from 2400 bit/s up to 2\u00a0Mbit/s, although speeds above 64\u00a0kbit/s were uncommon in the public networks. A segment was 64 bytes of data (rounded up, with no carry-over between packets), charged to the caller (or callee in the case of reverse charged calls, where supported). Calls invoking the \"Fast Select\" facility (allowing 128 bytes of data in call request, call confirmation and call clearing phases) would generally attract an extra charge, as might use of some of the other X.25 facilities. PVCs would have a monthly rental charge and a lower price-per-segment than VCs, making them cheaper only where large volumes of data are passed.\nX.25 details.\nThe network may allow the selection of the maximal length in range 16 to 4096 octets (2n values only) per virtual circuit by negotiation as part of the call setup procedure. The maximal length may be different at the two ends of the virtual circuit.\nX.25 facilities.\nX.25 provides a set of user facilities defined and described in ITU-T Recommendation X.2. The X.2 user facilities fall into five categories:\nX.25 also provides X.25 and ITU-T specified DTE optional user facilities defined and described in ITU-T Recommendation X.7. The X.7 optional user facilities fall into four categories of user facilities that require:\nX.25 protocol versions.\nThe CCITT/ITU-T versions of the protocol specifications are for public data networks (PDN). The ISO/IEC versions address additional features for private networks (e.g. local area networks (LAN) use) while maintaining compatibility with the CCITT/ITU-T specifications.\nThe user facilities and other features supported by each version of X.25 and ISO/IEC 8208 have varied from edition to edition. Several major protocol versions of X.25 exist:\nThe X.25 Recommendation allows many options for each network to choose when deciding which features to support and how certain operations are performed. This means each network needs to publish its own document giving the specification of its X.25 implementation, and most networks required DTE appliance manufacturers to undertake protocol conformance testing, which included testing for strict adherence and enforcement of their network specific options. (Network operators were particularly concerned about the possibility of a badly behaving or misconfigured DTE appliance taking out parts of the network and affecting other subscribers.) Therefore, subscriber's DTE appliances have to be configured to match the specification of the particular network to which they are connecting. Most of these were sufficiently different to prevent interworking if the subscriber didn't configure their appliance correctly or the appliance manufacturer didn't include specific support for that network. In spite of protocol conformance testing, this often lead to interworking problems when initially attaching an appliance to a network.\nIn addition to the CCITT/ITU-T versions of the protocol, four editions of ISO/IEC 8208 exist:\nLegacy.\nThe X.25 protocol had a lot of overhead to deal with data loss, since circuits back then ran over poor-grade cabling and had a lot of single-bit errors to deal with. As circuits became more and more reliable, the overhead was no longer needed, and less expensive Frame Relay took over. Frame Relay has its technical base in X.25, but does not attempt to correct errors.\nThe world-wide public data networks based on X.25 helped grow IP as a protocol riding on top. \nX.25 was also available in niche applications such as Retronet that allow vintage computers to use the Internet.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Known for her headstrong independence, spirited personality, and outspokenness, she cultivated a screen persona that matched this public image, and regularly played strong-willed, sophisticated women. She worked in a varied range of genres, from screwball comedy to literary drama, which earned her various accolades, including four Academy Awards for Best Actress\u2014a record for any performer.\nRaised in Connecticut by progressive parents, Hepburn began to act while at Bryn Mawr College. Favorable reviews of her work on Broadway brought her to the attention of Hollywood. Her early years in film brought her international fame, including an Academy Award for Best Actress for her third film, \"Morning Glory\" (1933), but this was followed by a series of commercial failures culminating in the critically lauded box office failure \"Bringing Up Baby\" (1938). Hepburn masterminded her comeback, buying out her contract with RKO Radio Pictures and acquiring the film rights to \"The Philadelphia Story\", which she sold on the condition that she be the star. That comedy film was a box office success and landed her a third Academy Award nomination. In the 1940s, she was contracted to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where her career focused on an alliance with Spencer Tracy. The screen partnership spanned 26 years and produced nine films.\nHepburn challenged herself in the latter half of her life as she tackled Shakespearean stage productions and a range of literary roles. She found a niche playing mature, independent, and sometimes unmarried or widowed women such as in \"The African Queen\" (1951), a persona the public embraced. Hepburn received three more Academy Awards for her performances in \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" (1967), \"The Lion in Winter\" (1968), and \"On Golden Pond\" (1981). In the 1970s, she began appearing in television films, which later became her focus. She made her final screen appearance at the age of 87. After a period of inactivity and ill health, Hepburn died in 2003 at the age of 96.\nHepburn famously shunned the Hollywood publicity machine, and refused to conform to societal expectations of women. She was outspoken, assertive, athletic, and wore pants before it was fashionable. She married once, as a young woman, but thereafter lived independently. A 26-year relationship with her co-star Spencer Tracy was hidden from the public. With her unconventional lifestyle and the independent characters she brought to the screen, Hepburn came to epitomize the \"modern woman\" in 20th-century America and influenced changing popular perceptions of women. In 1999, she was named the greatest female star of classic Hollywood cinema by the American Film Institute.\nEarly life and education.\nKatharine Houghton Hepburn was born on May 12, 1907, in Hartford, Connecticut, the second of six children. Her parents were Thomas Norval Hepburn (1879\u20131962), a urologist at Hartford Hospital, and Katharine Martha Houghton Hepburn (1878\u20131951), a feminist campaigner. Both parents fought for social change in the United States: Thomas Hepburn helped establish the New England Social Hygiene Association, which educated the public about venereal disease, while the elder Katharine headed the Connecticut Woman Suffrage Association and later campaigned for birth control with Margaret Sanger. As a child, Hepburn joined her mother on several \"Votes For Women\" demonstrations. The Hepburn children were raised to exercise freedom of speech and encouraged to think and debate on any topic they wished. Her parents were criticized by the community for their progressive views, which stimulated Hepburn to fight against barriers she encountered. Hepburn said she realized from a young age that she was the product of \"two very remarkable parents\", and credited her \"enormously lucky\" upbringing with providing the foundation for her success. She remained close with her family throughout her life.\nThe young Hepburn was a tomboy who liked to call herself Jimmy and cut her hair short. Thomas Hepburn was eager for his children to use their minds and bodies to the limit and taught them to swim, run, dive, ride, wrestle, and play golf and tennis. Golf became a passion of Hepburn's; she took daily lessons and became very adept, reaching the semi-final of the Connecticut Young Women's Golf Championship. She loved swimming in Long Island Sound, and took ice-cold baths every morning in the belief that \"the bitterer the medicine, the better it was for you\". Hepburn was a fan of films from a young age and went to see one every Saturday night. She would put on plays and perform for her neighbors with friends and siblings for 50 cents a ticket to raise money for the Navajo people.\nIn March 1921, Hepburn, 13, and her 15-year-old brother Tom were visiting New York, staying with a friend of their mother's in Greenwich Village over the Easter break. On March 30, Hepburn discovered the body of her adored older brother dead from an apparent suicide. He had tied a curtain tie around a beam and hanged himself. The Hepburn family denied it was suicide and maintained that Tom's death must have been an experiment that had gone wrong. The incident made the teenage Hepburn nervous, moody, and suspicious of people. She shied away from other children, dropped out of Oxford School (now Kingswood-Oxford School) and was tutored privately. For many years she used Tom's birthday (November 8) as her own. It was not until her 1991 autobiography, \"Me: Stories of My Life\", that Hepburn revealed her true birth date.\nIn 1924, Hepburn was admitted to Bryn Mawr College. She initially agreed to attend the institution to satisfy her mother, who had studied there, but ultimately found the experience to be unfulfilling. It was the first time she had been in school for several years, and she was self-conscious and uncomfortable with her classmates. She struggled with the scholastic demands of university, and once was suspended for smoking in her room. Hepburn was drawn to acting, but roles in college plays were conditional on good grades. Once her marks had improved, she began performing regularly. She performed the lead role in a production of \"The Woman in the Moon\" in her senior year, and the positive response it received cemented Hepburn's plans to pursue a theatrical career. She graduated with a degree in history and philosophy in June 1928.\nCareer.\nBreaking into theatre (1928\u20131932).\nHepburn left college determined to become an actress. The day after graduating, she traveled to Baltimore to meet Edwin H. Knopf, who ran a successful repertory theatre company. Impressed by her eagerness, Knopf cast Hepburn in \"The Czarina\". She received good reviews for her small role and the \"Printed Word\" described her performance as \"arresting\". She was given a part in the following week's show, but in that performance Hepburn was criticized for her shrill voice. She left Baltimore to study with Frances Robinson-Duff, a renowned voice teacher in New York City.\nKnopf decided to produce \"The Big Pond\" in New York and appointed Hepburn as understudy to the leading lady. A week before opening, the lead was fired and replaced with Hepburn, which gave her a starring role only four weeks into her theatre career. On opening night, she turned up late, mixed her lines, tripped over her feet, and spoke too quickly to be understood. She was immediately fired, and the original leading lady rehired. Undeterred, Hepburn joined forces with the producer Arthur Hopkins and accepted the role of a schoolgirl in \"These Days\". Her Broadway debut came on November 12, 1928, at the Cort Theatre, but reviews for the show were poor, and it closed after eight nights. Hopkins promptly hired Hepburn as the lead understudy in Philip Barry's play \"Holiday\". In early December, after only two weeks, she quit to marry Ludlow Ogden Smith, a college acquaintance. She planned to leave the theatre behind but began to miss the work and quickly resumed the understudy role in \"Holiday\", which she held for six months.\nIn 1929, Hepburn turned down a role with the Theatre Guild to play the lead in \"Death Takes a Holiday\". She felt the role was perfect, but again, she was fired. She went back to the Guild and took an understudy role for minimum pay in \"A Month in the Country\". In the spring of 1930, Hepburn joined the Berkshire Playhouse theater company in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. She left halfway through the summer season and continued studying with a drama tutor. In early 1931, she was cast in the Broadway production of \"Art and Mrs. Bottle\". She was released from the role after the playwright took a dislike to her, saying \"She looks a fright, her manner is objectionable, and she has no talent\", but Hepburn was re-hired when no other actress could be found. It went on to be a small success.\nHepburn appeared in a number of plays with a summer stock company in Ivoryton, Connecticut, and she proved to be a hit. During the summer of 1931, Philip Barry asked her to appear in his new play, \"The Animal Kingdom\", alongside Leslie Howard. They began rehearsals in November, Hepburn feeling sure the role would make her a star, but Howard disliked the actress and again she was fired. When she asked Barry why she had been let go, he responded, \"Well, to be brutally frank, you weren't very good.\" This unsettled the self-assured Hepburn, but she continued to look for work. She took a small role in an upcoming play, but as rehearsals began, she was asked to read for the lead in the Greek fable \"The Warrior's Husband\".\n\"The Warrior's Husband\" proved to be Hepburn's breakout performance. Biographer Charles Higham states that the role was ideal for the actress, requiring an aggressive energy and athleticism, and she enthusiastically involved herself with its production. The play opened March 11, 1932, at the Morosco Theatre on Broadway. Hepburn's first entrance called for her to leap down a narrow stairway with a stag over her shoulder, wearing a short silver tunic. The show ran for three months, and Hepburn received positive reviews. Richard Garland of the \"New York World-Telegram\" wrote, \"It's been many a night since so glowing a performance has brightened the Broadway scene.\"\nHollywood success (1932\u20131934).\nA scout for the Hollywood agent Leland Hayward spotted Hepburn's appearance in \"The Warrior's Husband\", and asked her to test for the part of Sydney Fairfield in the upcoming RKO film \"A Bill of Divorcement\". Director George Cukor was impressed by what he saw: \"There was this odd creature\", he recalled, \"she was unlike anybody I'd ever heard.\" He particularly liked the manner in which she picked up a glass: \"I thought she was very talented in that action.\" Offered the role, Hepburn demanded $1,500 a week, a large amount for an unknown actress. Cukor encouraged the studio to accept her demands and they signed Hepburn to a temporary contract with a three-week guarantee. RKO head David O. Selznick recounted that he took a \"tremendous chance\" in casting the unusual actress.\nHepburn arrived in California in July 1932, at 25 years old. She starred in \"A Bill of Divorcement\" opposite John Barrymore, but showed no sign of intimidation. Although she struggled to adapt to the nature of film acting, Hepburn was fascinated by the industry from the start. The picture was a success and Hepburn received positive reviews. Mordaunt Hall of \"The New York Times\" called her performance \"exceptionally fine ... Miss Hepburn's characterization is one of the finest seen on the screen\". The \"Variety\" review declared, \"Standout here is the smash impression made by Katharine Hepburn in her first picture assignment. She has a vital something that sets her apart from the picture galaxy.\" On the strength of \"A Bill of Divorcement\", RKO signed her to a long-term contract. George Cukor became a lifetime friend and colleague\u2014he and Hepburn made ten films together.\nHepburn's second film was \"Christopher Strong\" (1933), the story of an aviator and her affair with a married man. The picture was not commercially successful, but Hepburn's reviews were good. Regina Crewe wrote in the \"Journal-American\" that although her mannerisms were grating, \"they compel attention, and they fascinate an audience. She is a distinct, definite, positive personality.\" Hepburn's third picture confirmed her as a major actress in Hollywood. For playing aspiring actress Eva Lovelace\u2014a role intended for Constance Bennett\u2014in \"Morning Glory\", she won an Academy Award for Best Actress. She had seen the script on the desk of producer Pandro S. Berman and, convinced that she was born to play the part, insisted that the role be hers. Hepburn chose not to attend the awards ceremony\u2014as she would not for the duration of her career\u2014but was thrilled with the win. Her success continued with the role of Jo in the film \"Little Women\" (1933). The picture was a hit, one of the film industry's biggest successes to date, and Hepburn won the Best Actress prize at the Venice Film Festival. \"Little Women\" was one of Hepburn's personal favorites and she was proud of her performance, later saying, \"I defy anyone to be as good [as Jo] as I was\".\nBy the end of 1933, Hepburn was a respected film actress, but she yearned to prove herself on Broadway. Jed Harris, one of the most successful theatre producers of the 1920s, was going through a career slump. He asked Hepburn to appear in the play \"The Lake\", which she agreed to do for a low salary. Before she was given leave, RKO asked that she film \"Spitfire\" (1934). Hepburn's role in the movie was Trigger Hicks, an uneducated mountain girl. Though it did well at the box office, \"Spitfire\" is widely considered one of Hepburn's worst films, and she received poor reviews for the effort. Hepburn kept a photo of herself as Hicks in her bedroom throughout her life to \"[keep] me humble\".\n\"The Lake\" previewed in Washington, D.C., where there was a large advance sale. Harris' poor direction had eroded Hepburn's confidence, and she struggled with the performance. Despite this, Harris moved the play to New York without further rehearsal. It opened at the Martin Beck Theatre on December 26, 1933, and Hepburn was roundly panned by the critics. Dorothy Parker quipped, \"She runs the gamut of emotions all the way from A to B.\" Already tied to a ten-week contract, she had to endure the embarrassment of rapidly declining box office sales. Harris decided to take the show to Chicago, saying to Hepburn, \"My dear, the only interest I have in you is the money I can make out of you.\" Hepburn did not want to continue in a failing show, so she paid Harris $14,000, most of her life savings, to close the production instead. She later referred to Harris as \"hands-down the most diabolical person I have ever met\", and claimed this experience was important in teaching her to take responsibility for her career.\nCareer setbacks (1934\u20131938).\nAfter the failure of \"Spitfire\" and \"The Lake\", RKO cast Hepburn in \"The Little Minister\" (1934), based on a Victorian novel by James Barrie, in an attempt to repeat the success of \"Little Women\". There was no such recurrence, and the picture was a commercial failure. The romantic drama \"Break of Hearts\" (1935) with Charles Boyer was poorly reviewed and also lost money. After three forgettable films, success returned to Hepburn with \"Alice Adams\" (1935), the story of a girl's desperation to climb the social ladder. Hepburn loved the book and was delighted to be offered the role. The film was a hit, one of Hepburn's personal favorites, and gave the actress her second Oscar nomination. She received the second most votes, after winner Bette Davis.\nGiven the choice of her next feature, Hepburn decided to star in George Cukor's new project, \"Sylvia Scarlett\" (1935), which paired her for the first time with Cary Grant. Her hair was cut short for the part, as her character masquerades as a boy for much of the film. Critics disliked \"Sylvia Scarlett\" and it was unpopular with the public. She next played Mary Stuart in John Ford's \"Mary of Scotland\" (1936), which met with a similarly poor reception. \"A Woman Rebels\" (1936) followed, a Victorian-era drama where Hepburn's character defied convention by having a child out of wedlock. \"Quality Street\" (1937) also had a period setting, this time a comedy. Neither movie was popular with the public, which meant she had made four unsuccessful pictures in a row.\nAlongside a series of unpopular films, problems arose from Hepburn's attitude. She had a difficult relationship with the press, with whom she could be rude and provocative. When asked if she had any children, she snapped back, \"Yes, I have five: two white and three colored.\" She would not give interviews and denied requests for autographs, which earned her the nickname \"Katharine of Arrogance\". The public was also baffled by her boyish behavior and fashion choices, and she became a largely unpopular figure. Hepburn sensed that she needed to leave Hollywood, so she returned east to star in a theatrical adaptation of \"Jane Eyre\". It had a successful tour, but, uncertain about the script and unwilling to risk failure after the disaster of \"The Lake\", Hepburn decided against taking the show to Broadway. Towards the end of 1936, Hepburn vied for the role of Scarlett O'Hara in \"Gone with the Wind\". Producer David O. Selznick refused to offer her the part because he felt she had no sex appeal. He reportedly told Hepburn, \"I can't see Rhett Butler chasing you for twelve years.\"\nHepburn's next feature, \"Stage Door\" (1937), paired her with Ginger Rogers in a role that mirrored her own life\u2014that of a wealthy society girl trying to make it as an actress. Hepburn was praised for her work at early previews, which gave her top billing over Rogers. The film was nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, but it was not the box-office hit RKO had hoped for. Industry pundits blamed Hepburn for the small profit, but the studio continued its commitment to resurrecting her popularity. She was cast in Howard Hawks' screwball comedy \"Bringing Up Baby\" (1938), where she played a flighty heiress who loses a leopard while trying to woo a palaeontologist (Cary Grant). She approached the physical comedy of the film with confidence, and took tips on comedic timing from her co-star Walter Catlett. \"Bringing Up Baby\" was acclaimed by critics, but it was nevertheless unsuccessful at the box office. With the genre and Grant both hugely popular at the time, biographer A. Scott Berg believes the blame lay with moviegoers' rejection of Hepburn.\nAfter the release of \"Bringing Up Baby\", the Independent Theatre Owners of America included Hepburn on a list of actors considered \"box office poison\". Her reputation at a low, the next film RKO offered her was \"Mother Carey's Chickens\", a B movie with poor prospects. Hepburn turned it down, and instead opted to buy out her contract for $75,000. Many actors were afraid to leave the stability of the studio system at the time, but Hepburn's personal wealth meant she could afford to be independent. She signed on for the film version of \"Holiday\" (1938) with Columbia Pictures, pairing her for the third time with Grant, to play a stifled society girl who finds joy with her sister's fianc\u00e9. The comedy was positively reviewed, but it failed to draw much of an audience, and the next script offered to Hepburn came with a salary of $10,000\u2014less than she had received at the start of her film career. Reflecting on this change in fortunes, Andrew Britton writes of Hepburn, \"No other star has emerged with greater rapidity or with more ecstatic acclaim. No other star, either, has become so unpopular so quickly for so long a time.\"\nRevival (1939\u20131942).\nFollowing this decline in her career, Hepburn took action to create her own comeback vehicle. She left Hollywood to look for a stage project, and signed on to star in Philip Barry's new play, \"The Philadelphia Story\". It was tailored to showcase the actress, with the character of socialite Tracy Lord incorporating a mixture of humor, aggression, nervousness, and vulnerability. Howard Hughes, Hepburn's partner at the time, sensed that the play could be her ticket back to Hollywood stardom and bought her the film rights before it even debuted on stage. \"The Philadelphia Story\" first toured the United States, to positive reviews, and then opened in New York at the Shubert Theatre on March 28, 1939. It was a big hit, critically and financially, running for 417 performances and then going on a second successful tour.\nSeveral of the major film studios approached Hepburn to produce the movie version of Barry's play. She chose to sell the rights to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Hollywood's number one studio, on the condition that she be the star. As part of the deal she also received the director of her choice, George Cukor, and picked James Stewart and Cary Grant (to whom she ceded top-billing) as co-stars. Before filming began, Hepburn shrewdly noted, \"I don't want to make a grand entrance in this picture. Moviegoers\u00a0... think I'm too la-di-da or something. A lot of people want to see me fall flat on my face.\" Thus the film began with Grant knocking the actress flat on her backside. Berg describes how the character was crafted to have audiences \"laugh at her enough that they would ultimately sympathize with her\", which Hepburn felt was crucial in \"recreating\" her public image. \"The Philadelphia Story\" was one of the biggest hits of 1940, breaking records at Radio City Music Hall. The review in \"Time\" declared, \"Come on back, Katie, all is forgiven.\" Herb Golden of \"Variety\" stated, \"It's Katharine Hepburn's picture\u00a0... The perfect conception of all flighty, but characterful, Main Line socialite gals rolled into one, the story without her is almost inconceivable.\" Hepburn was nominated for her third Academy Award for Best Actress, and won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress while Stewart won his only Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance.\nHepburn was also responsible for the development of her next project, the romantic comedy \"Woman of the Year\" about a political columnist and a sports reporter whose relationship is threatened by her self-centered independence. The idea for the film was proposed to her in 1941 by Garson Kanin, who recalled how Hepburn contributed to the script. She presented the finished product to MGM and demanded $250,000\u2014half for her, half for the authors. Her terms accepted, Hepburn was also given the director and co-star of her choice, George Stevens and Spencer Tracy. On Hepburn and Tracy's first day on set together, she allegedly told Tracy \"I'm afraid I'm too tall for you\" to which Tracy replied, \"Don't worry Miss Hepburn, I'll soon cut you down to my size.\" It started a relationship on screen and off that lasted until Tracy's death in 1967 with them appearing in another eight films together. Released in 1942, \"Woman of the Year\" was another success. Critics praised the chemistry between the stars, and, says Higham, noted Hepburn's \"increasing maturity and polish\". The \"World-Telegram\" commended two \"brilliant performances\", and Hepburn received a fourth Academy Award nomination. During the course of the movie, Hepburn signed a star contract with MGM.\nSlowing in the 1940s (1942\u20131949).\nIn 1942, Hepburn returned to Broadway to appear in another Philip Barry play, \"Without Love\", which was also written with the actress in mind. Critics were unenthusiastic about the production, but with Hepburn's popularity at a high, it ran for 16 sold-out weeks. MGM was eager to reunite Tracy and Hepburn for a new picture and settled on \"Keeper of the Flame\" (1942). A dark mystery with a propaganda message on the dangers of fascism, the film was seen by Hepburn as an opportunity to make a worthy political statement. It received poor notices, but was a financial success, confirming the popularity of the Tracy\u2013Hepburn pairing.\nSince \"Woman of the Year\", Hepburn had committed to a romantic relationship with Tracy and dedicated herself to helping the star, who suffered from alcoholism and insomnia. Her career slowed as a result, and she worked less for the remainder of the decade than she had done in the 1930s\u2014notably by not appearing on stage again until 1950. Her only appearance in 1943 was a cameo in the morale-building wartime film \"Stage Door Canteen\", playing herself. She took an atypical role in 1944, playing a Chinese peasant in the high-budget drama \"Dragon Seed\". Hepburn was enthusiastic about the film, but it met with a tepid response and she was described as miscast. She then reunited with Tracy for the film version of \"Without Love\" (1945), after which she turned down a role in \"The Razor's Edge\" to support Tracy through his return to Broadway. \"Without Love\" received poor reviews, but a new Tracy\u2013Hepburn picture was a big event and it was popular on release, selling a record number of tickets over the Easter weekend in 1945.\nHepburn's next film was \"Undercurrent\" (1946), a film noir with Robert Taylor and Robert Mitchum that was poorly received. A fourth film with Tracy came in 1947: a drama set in the American Old West entitled \"The Sea of Grass\". Similarly to \"Keeper of the Flame\" and \"Without Love\", a lukewarm response from critics did not stop it from being a financial success both at home and abroad. The same year, Hepburn portrayed Clara Wieck Schumann in \"Song of Love\". She trained intensively with a pianist for the role. By the time of its release in October, Hepburn's career had been significantly affected by her public opposition to the growing anti-communist movement in Hollywood. Viewed by some as dangerously progressive, she was not offered work for nine months and people reportedly threw things at screenings of \"Song of Love\". Her next film role came unexpectedly, as she agreed to replace Claudette Colbert only days before shooting began on Frank Capra's political drama \"State of the Union\" (1948). Tracy had long been signed to play the male lead, and so Hepburn was already familiar with the script and stepped up for the fifth Tracy\u2013Hepburn picture. Critics responded positively to the film and it performed well at the box-office.\nTracy and Hepburn appeared onscreen together for a third consecutive year in the 1949 film \"Adam's Rib\". Like \"Woman of the Year\", it was a \"battle of the sexes\" comedy and was written specifically for the duo by their friends Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon. A story of married lawyers who oppose each other in court, Hepburn described it as \"perfect for [Tracy] and me\". Although her political views still prompted scattered picketing at theatres around the country, \"Adam's Rib\" was a hit, favorably reviewed and the most profitable Tracy\u2013Hepburn picture to date. \"The New York Times\" critic Bosley Crowther was full of praise for the film and hailed the duo's \"perfect compatibility\".\nProfessional expansion (1950\u20131952).\nThe 1950s saw Hepburn take on a series of professional challenges, and stretch herself further than at any other point in her life at an age when most other actresses began to retreat. Berg describes the decade as \"the heart of her vast legacy\" and \"the period in which she truly came into her own\". In January 1950, Hepburn ventured into Shakespeare, playing Rosalind on stage in \"As You Like It\". She hoped to prove that she could play already established material, and said, \"It's better to try something difficult and flop than to play it safe all the time.\" It opened on Broadway at the Cort Theatre in New York to a capacity audience and was virtually sold out for 148 shows. The production then went on tour. Reviews for Hepburn varied, but she was noted as the only leading lady in Hollywood who was performing high-caliber material onstage.\nIn 1951, Hepburn filmed \"The African Queen\", her first movie in Technicolor. She played Rose Sayer, a prim missionary living in German East Africa at the outbreak of World War I. Co-starring Humphrey Bogart, \"The African Queen\" was shot mostly on location in the Belgian Congo, an opportunity Hepburn embraced. It proved a difficult experience, however, and Hepburn became ill with dysentery during filming. Later in life, she released a memoir about the experience. The movie was released at the end of 1951 to popular support and critical acclaim, and gave Hepburn her fifth Best Actress nomination at the Academy Awards while garnering Bogart his only Academy Award for Best Actor. The first successful film she had made without Tracy since \"The Philadelphia Story\" a decade earlier, it proved that she could be a hit without him and fully reestablished her popularity.\nHepburn went on to make the sports comedy \"Pat and Mike\" (1952), the second film written specifically as a Tracy\u2013Hepburn vehicle by Kanin and Gordon. She was a keen athlete, and Kanin later described this as his inspiration for the film: \"As I watched Kate playing tennis one day ... it occurred to me that her audience was missing a treat.\" Hepburn was under pressure to perform several sports to a high standard, many of which did not end up in the film. \"Pat and Mike\" was one of the team's most popular and critically acclaimed films, and it was also Hepburn's personal favorite of the nine films she made with Tracy. The performance brought her a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress\u00a0\u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.\nIn the summer of 1952, Hepburn appeared in London's West End for a ten-week run of George Bernard Shaw's \"The Millionairess\". Her parents had read Shaw to her when she was a child, which made the play a special experience for the actress. Two years of intense work had left her exhausted, however, and her friend Constance Collier wrote that Hepburn was \"on the verge of a nervous breakdown\". Widely acclaimed, \"The Millionairess\" was taken to Broadway. In October 1952 it opened at the Shubert Theatre, where despite a lukewarm critical response it sold out its ten-week run. Hepburn subsequently tried to get the play adapted into a film: a script was written by Preston Sturges, and she offered to work for nothing and pay the director herself, but no studio picked up the project. She later referred to this as the biggest disappointment of her career.\nMid-career and Shakespeare (1953\u20131962).\n\"Pat and Mike\" was the last film Hepburn completed on her MGM contract, making her free to select her own projects. She spent two years resting and traveling, before committing to David Lean's romantic drama \"Summertime\" (1955). The movie was filmed in Venice, with Hepburn playing an unmarried woman who has a passionate love affair. She described it as \"a very emotional part\" and found it fascinating to work with Lean. At her own insistence, Hepburn performed a fall into a canal and developed a chronic eye infection as a result. The role earned her another Academy Award nomination and has been cited as some of her finest work. Lean later said it was his personal favorite of the films he made, and Hepburn his favorite actress. The following year, Hepburn spent six months touring Australia with the Old Vic theatre company, playing Portia in \"The Merchant of Venice\", Kate in \"The Taming of the Shrew\", and Isabella in \"Measure for Measure\". The tour was successful and Hepburn earned significant plaudits for the effort.\nHepburn received an Academy Award nomination for the second year running for her work opposite Burt Lancaster in \"The Rainmaker\" (1956). Again she played a lonely woman empowered by a love affair, and it became apparent that Hepburn had found a niche in playing mature, unmarried women. Hepburn said of playing such roles, \"With Lizzie Curry [\"The Rainmaker\"] and Jane Hudson [\"Summertime\"] and Rosie Sayer [\"The African Queen\"]\u2014I was playing me. It wasn't difficult for me to play those women, because I'm the maiden aunt.\" Less success that year came from \"The Iron Petticoat\" (1956), a reworking of the classic Greta Garbo comedy \"Ninotchka\". Starring opposite Bob Hope, Hepburn played a cold-hearted Soviet pilot, in a performance Bosley Crowther called \"horrible\". The film was a critical and commercial failure, and Hepburn considered it the worst movie of her career.\nTracy and Hepburn reunited on screen for the first time in five years for the office-based comedy \"Desk Set\" (1957). Berg notes that it worked as a hybrid of their earlier romantic-comedy successes, but it performed poorly at the box-office. That summer, Hepburn returned to Shakespeare. Appearing in Stratford, Connecticut, at the American Shakespeare Theatre, she repeated her Portia in \"The Merchant of Venice\" and played Beatrice in \"Much Ado About Nothing\". The shows were positively received.\nAfter two years away from the screen, Hepburn starred in a film adaptation of Tennessee Williams' controversial play \"Suddenly, Last Summer\" (1959) with Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift. The movie was shot in London and was \"a completely miserable experience\" for Hepburn. She clashed with director Joseph L. Mankiewicz during filming, which culminated with her spitting at him in disgust. The picture was a financial success, and her work as creepy aunt Violet Venable gave Hepburn her eighth Oscar nomination. Williams was pleased with the performance, writing, \"Kate is a playwright's dream-actress. She makes dialogue sound better than it is by a matchless beauty and clarity of diction\". He wrote \"The Night of the Iguana\" (1961) with Hepburn in mind, but the actress, although flattered, felt the play was wrong for her and declined the part, which went to Deborah Kerr.\nHepburn returned to Stratford in the summer of 1960 to play Viola in \"Twelfth Night\", and Cleopatra in \"Antony and Cleopatra\". The \"New York Post\" wrote of her Cleopatra, \"Hepburn offers a highly versatile performance ... once or twice going in for her famous mannerisms and always being fascinating to watch.\" Hepburn herself was proud of the role. Her repertoire was further improved when she appeared in Sidney Lumet's film version of Eugene O'Neill's \"Long Day's Journey Into Night\" (1962). It was a low-budget production, and she appeared in the film for a tenth of her established salary. She called it \"the greatest [play] this country has ever produced\" and the role of morphine-addicted Mary Tyrone \"the most challenging female role in American drama\", and felt her performance was the best screen work of her career. \"Long Day's Journey Into Night\" earned Hepburn an Oscar nomination and the Best Actress Award at the Cannes Film Festival. It remains one of her most praised performances.\nSuccess in later years (1963\u20131970).\nFollowing the completion of \"Long Day's Journey Into Night\", Hepburn took a break in her career to care for ailing Spencer Tracy. She did not work again until 1967's \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\", her ninth and final film with Tracy. The movie dealt with the subject of interracial marriage, with Hepburn's niece, Katharine Houghton, playing her daughter. Tracy was dying by this point, suffering the effects of diabetes and heart disease, and Houghton later commented that her aunt was \"extremely tense\" during the production. Tracy died 17 days after filming his last scene. \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" was a triumphant return for Hepburn and her most commercially successful picture to that point. She won her second Best Actress Award at the Oscars, 34 years after winning her first. Hepburn felt the award was not just for her but was also given to honor Tracy.\nHepburn quickly returned to acting after Tracy's death, choosing to occupy herself as a remedy against grief. She received numerous scripts and chose to play Eleanor of Aquitaine in \"The Lion in Winter\" (1968), a part she called \"fascinating\". She read extensively in preparation for the role, in which she starred opposite Peter O'Toole. Filming took place in Montmajour Abbey in the south of France, an experience she loved despite being\u2014according to director Anthony Harvey\u2014\"enormously vulnerable\" throughout. John Russell Taylor of \"The Times\" suggested that Eleanor was \"the performance of her ... career\", and proved that she was \"a growing, developing, still surprising actress\". The movie was nominated in all the major categories at the 41st Academy Awards, and for the second year running Hepburn won the Oscar for Best Actress (shared with Barbra Streisand for \"Funny Girl\"). The role, combined with her performance in \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\", also received a British Academy Film Award (BAFTA) for Best Actress. Hepburn's next appearance was in \"The Madwoman of Chaillot\" (1969), which she filmed in Nice immediately after completing \"The Lion in Winter\". The picture was a failure critically and financially, and reviews targeted Hepburn for giving a misguided performance. By the end of 1969, she was voted the most popular female star in America by Quigley's Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll, making a rare occurrence of an actress over 50 and 60 to achieve such a position.\nFrom December 1969 to August 1970, Hepburn starred in the Broadway musical \"Coco\", about the life of Coco Chanel. She admitted that before the show, she had never sat through a theatrical musical. She was not a strong singer, but found the offer irresistible and, as Berg puts it, \"what she lacked in euphony she made up for in guts\". The actress took vocal lessons six times a week in preparation for the show. She was nervous about every performance and recalled \"wondering what the hell I was doing there\". Reviews for the production were mediocre, but Hepburn herself was praised, and \"Coco\" was popular with the public\u2014with its run twice extended. She later said \"Coco\" marked the first time she accepted that the public was not against her, but actually seemed to love her. Her work earned a Tony Award nomination for Best Actress in a Musical.\nFilm, television, and theatre (1971\u20131983).\nHepburn stayed active throughout the 1970s, focusing on roles described by Andrew Britton as \"either a devouring mother or a batty old lady living [alone]\". First she traveled to Spain to film a version of Euripides' \"The Trojan Women\" (1971) alongside Vanessa Redgrave. When asked why she had taken the role, she responded that she wanted to broaden her range and try everything while she still had time. The movie was poorly received, but the Kansas City Film Critics Circle named Hepburn's performance the best from an actress that year. In 1971, she signed on to star in an adaptation of Graham Greene's \"Travels with My Aunt\", but was unhappy with early versions of the script and took to rewriting it herself. The studio disliked her changes, so Hepburn abandoned the project and was replaced with Maggie Smith. Her next film, an adaptation of Edward Albee's \"A Delicate Balance\" (1973) directed by Tony Richardson, had a small release and received generally unfavorable reviews.\nIn 1973, Hepburn ventured into television for the first time, starring in a production of Tennessee Williams' \"The Glass Menagerie\". She had been wary of the medium, but it proved to be one of the main television events of the year, scoring high in the Nielsen ratings. Hepburn received an Emmy Award nomination for playing wistful Southern mother Amanda Wingfield, which opened her mind to future work on the small screen. Her next project was the television movie \"Love Among the Ruins\" (1975), a London-based Edwardian drama with her friend Laurence Olivier. It received positive reviews and high ratings and earned Hepburn her only Emmy Award.\nHepburn made her only appearance at the Academy Awards in 1974, to present the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award to Lawrence Weingarten. She received a standing ovation, and joked with the audience, \"I'm very happy I didn't hear anyone call out, 'It's about time'.\" The following year, she was paired with John Wayne in the western \"Rooster Cogburn\", a sequel to his Oscar-winning film \"True Grit\". Echoing her \"African Queen\" character, Hepburn played a deeply religious unmarried woman who teams up with a masculine loner to avenge a family member's death. The movie received mediocre reviews. Its casting was enough to draw some people to the box office, but it did not meet studio expectations and was only moderately successful.\nIn 1976, Hepburn returned to Broadway for a three-month run of Enid Bagnold's play \"A Matter of Gravity\". The role of eccentric Mrs. Basil was deemed a perfect showcase for the actress, and the play was popular despite poor reviews. It later went on a successful nationwide tour. During its Los Angeles run, Hepburn fractured her hip, but she chose to continue the tour performing in a wheelchair. That year, she was voted \"Favorite Motion Picture Actress\" by the People's Choice Awards.\nDuring the summer of 1976, Hepburn starred in the low-budget family film \"Olly Olly Oxen Free\". The feature failed to find a major-studio distributor and was finally released independently in 1978. Because of its poor distribution, it played in relatively few theaters, resulting in one of the biggest misfires of Hepburn's career. The screenwriter James Prideaux, who worked with Hepburn, later wrote that it \"died at the moment of release\" and referred to it as her \"lost film\". Hepburn claimed the main reason she had done it was the opportunity to ride in a hot-air balloon. The television movie \"The Corn Is Green\" (1979), which was filmed in Wales, followed. It was the last of ten films Hepburn made with George Cukor, and gained her a third Emmy nomination.\nBy the 1980s, Hepburn had developed a noticeable tremor, giving her a permanently shaking head. She did not work for two years, saying in a television interview, \"I've had my day\u2014let the kids scramble and sweat it out.\" During this period she saw the Broadway production \"On Golden Pond\", and was impressed by its depiction of an elderly married couple coping with the difficulties of old age. Jane Fonda had purchased the screen rights for her father, actor Henry Fonda, and Hepburn sought to play opposite him in the role of quirky Ethel Thayer. \"On Golden Pond\" was a success, the second-highest-grossing film of 1981. It demonstrated how energetic the 74-year-old Hepburn was, as she dived fully clothed into Squam Lake and gave a lively singing performance. The film won her a second BAFTA and a record fourth Academy Award. Homer Dickens, in his book on Hepburn, notes that it was widely considered a sentimental win, \"a tribute to her enduring career\".\nHepburn also returned to the stage in 1981. She received a second Tony nomination for her portrayal in \"The West Side Waltz\" of a septuagenarian widow with a zest for life. \"Variety\" observed that the role was \"an obvious and entirely acceptable version of [Hepburn's] own public image\". Walter Kerr of \"The New York Times\" wrote of Hepburn and her performance, \"One mysterious thing she has learned to do is breathe unchallengeable life into lifeless lines.\" She hoped to make a film out of the production, but nobody purchased the rights. Hepburn's reputation as one of America's best loved actors was firmly established by this point, as she was named favorite movie actress in a survey by \"People\" magazine and again won the popularity award from People's Choice.\nFocus on television (1984\u20131994).\nIn 1984, Hepburn starred in the dark-comedy \"Grace Quigley\", the story of an elderly woman who enlists a hitman (Nick Nolte) to kill her. Hepburn found humor in the morbid theme, but reviews were negative and the box-office was poor. In 1985, she presented a television documentary about the life and career of Spencer Tracy. The majority of Hepburn's roles from this point were in television movies, which did not receive the critical praise of her earlier work in the medium, but remained popular with audiences. With each release, Hepburn would declare it her final screen appearance, but she continued to take on new roles. She received an Emmy nomination for 1986's \"Mrs. Delafield Wants to Marry\", then two years later returned for the comedy \"Laura Lansing Slept Here\", which allowed her to act with her grandniece, Schuyler Grant.\nIn 1991, Hepburn released her autobiography, \"Me: Stories of My Life\", which topped best-seller lists for over a year. She returned to television screens in 1992 for \"The Man Upstairs\", co-starring Ryan O'Neal, for which she received a Golden Globe nomination. In 1994, she worked opposite Anthony Quinn in \"This Can't Be Love\", which was largely based on Hepburn's own life, with numerous references to her personality and career. These later roles have been described as \"a fictional version of the typically feisty Kate Hepburn character\" and critics have remarked that Hepburn was essentially playing herself.\nHepburn's final appearance in a theatrically released film, and her first since \"Grace Quigley\" nine years earlier, was \"Love Affair\" (1994). At 87 years old, she played a supporting role, alongside Annette Bening and Warren Beatty. It was the only film of Hepburn's career, other than the cameo appearance in \"Stage Door Canteen\", in which she did not play a leading role. Roger Ebert noted that it was the first time she had looked frail, but that the \"magnificent spirit\" was still there, and said her scenes \"steal the show\". A writer for \"The New York Times\" reflected on the actress's final big-screen appearance: \"If she moved more slowly than before, in demeanor, she was as game and modern as she had ever been.\" Hepburn played her final role in the television film \"One Christmas\" (1994), for which she received a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination at 87 years old.\nPersonal life.\nBeliefs.\nIn 1991, Hepburn told \"Ladies' Home Journal\", \"I'm an atheist, and that's it. I believe there's nothing we can know except that we should be kind to each other and do what we can for each other.\" Hepburn aligned herself with liberalism and humanistic values.\nPublic image and character.\nHepburn was known for being fiercely private, and would not give interviews or talk to fans for much of her career. She distanced herself from the celebrity life and was not interested in a social scene she saw as tedious and superficial. She wore casual clothes that went strongly against convention in an era of glamour. She rarely appeared in public, usually avoided restaurants and once wrestled a camera out of a photographer's hand when he took her picture without asking. Despite her zeal for privacy, she enjoyed her fame and later confessed that she would not have liked the press to ignore her. The protective attitude toward her private life diminished as she aged; beginning with a two-hour-long interview on \"The Dick Cavett Show\" in 1973, Hepburn became much more open with the public.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"I strike people as peculiar in some way, although I don't quite understand why. Of course, I have an angular face, an angular body, and, I suppose, an angular personality, which jabs into people.\"\n\"I'm a personality as well as an actress. Show me an actress who isn't a personality, and you'll show me a woman who isn't a star.\"\n\u2014 Hepburn commenting on her personality.\nHepburn's relentless energy and enthusiasm for life are often cited in biographies and her headstrong independence became key to her celebrity status. This self-assurance came with a tendency to be controlling and difficult; her friend Garson Kanin likened her to a schoolmistress and she was famously blunt and outspoken. Katharine Houghton commented that her aunt could be \"maddeningly self-righteous and bossy\". Hepburn confessed to being, especially early in life, \"a \"me me me\" person\". She saw herself as having a happy nature, reasoning \"I like life and I've been so lucky, why shouldn't I be happy?\" A. Scott Berg knew Hepburn well in her later years and said that while she was demanding, she retained a sense of humility and humanity.\nThe actress led an active life, reportedly swimming and playing tennis every morning. In her eighties she was still playing tennis regularly, as indicated in her 1993 documentary \"All About Me\". She also enjoyed painting, which became a passion later in life. Asked about politics, Hepburn told an interviewer, \"I always just say be on the affirmative and liberal side. Don't be a 'no' person\". The anti-Communist attitude in 1940s Hollywood prompted her to political activity, as she joined the Committee for the First Amendment. Her name was mentioned at the hearings of the House Un-American Activities Committee but Hepburn denied being a Communist sympathizer. Later in life, she openly promoted birth control and supported the legal right to abortion. She described herself as a \"dedicated Democrat\". She practiced Albert Schweitzer's theory of \"Reverence for Life\" but did not believe in religion or the afterlife. In 1991, Hepburn told a journalist, \"I'm an atheist, and that's it. I believe there's nothing we can know, except that we should be kind to each other and do what we can for other people\". Her public declarations of these beliefs led the American Humanist Association to award her the Humanist Arts Award in 1985.\nHepburn liked to go barefoot and for her first acting role, in the play \"The Woman in the Moon\", she insisted that her character Pandora should not wear shoes. Offscreen, she usually dressed in slacks and sandals, even for formal occasions, such as television interviews. She said, \"the thing that drove me out of skirts was the stocking situation ... That's why I've always worn pants ... that way you can always go barefoot\".\nRelationships.\nHepburn's only marriage was to Ludlow Ogden Smith, a socialite-businessman from Philadelphia whom she met while a student at Bryn Mawr. The couple wed on December 12, 1928, when she was 21 and he was 29. Smith changed his name to S. Ogden Ludlow at her behest so that she would not be \"Kate Smith\", which she considered too plain. She never fully committed to the marriage, prioritizing her career. Furthermore, Hepburn's fiery personality did not go well with Smith's calm, quiet demeanor. She was also having an affair with her agent, Leland Hayward. The move to Hollywood in 1932 cemented the couple's estrangement. Hepburn filed for divorce in M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n, on April 30, 1934, and it was finalized on May 8. Hepburn often expressed her gratitude toward Smith for his financial and moral support in the early days of her career, and in her autobiography she called herself \"a terrible pig\" for exploiting his love. The pair remained friends until his death in 1979.\nHepburn's affair with Hayward began after she moved to California, although they were both married. Hayward proposed to the actress after they had both divorced, but she declined, later explaining, \"I liked the idea of being my own single self.\" The affair lasted four years. In 1936, while she was touring with \"Jane Eyre,\" Hepburn began a relationship with entrepreneur Howard Hughes. She had been introduced to him a year earlier by their mutual friend Cary Grant. Hughes wished to marry her, and the tabloids reported their impending nuptials, but Hepburn stayed focused on resurrecting her failing career. They separated in 1938, when Hepburn left Hollywood after being labeled \"box office poison\".\nHepburn stuck to her decision not to remarry and made a conscious choice not to have children. She believed that motherhood required a full-time commitment and said it was not one she was willing to make. \"I would have been a terrible mother,\" she told Berg, \"because I'm basically a very selfish human being.\" She felt she had partially experienced parenthood through her much younger siblings, which fulfilled any need to have children of her own.\nRumors have existed since the 1930s that Hepburn was a lesbian or bisexual, which she often joked about. In 2007, William J. Mann released a biography of the actress in which he argued this was the case. In response to this speculation, her niece, Katharine Houghton said, \"I've never discovered any evidence whatsoever that she was a lesbian.\" However, in a 2017 documentary, columnist Liz Smith, who was a close friend, attested that she was.\nSpencer Tracy.\nThe most significant relationship of Hepburn's life was with Spencer Tracy, her co-star in nine films. In her autobiography, she wrote, \"It was a unique feeling that I had for [Tracy]. I would have done anything for him.\" Lauren Bacall, a close friend, later wrote of how \"blindingly\" in love Hepburn was with the actor. The relationship has subsequently been publicized as one of Hollywood's legendary love affairs.\nHepburn and Tracy met at MGM in 1941, when they were to begin filming \"Woman of the Year\", when she was 34 and he was 41. Tracy was initially wary of Hepburn, unimpressed by her dirty fingernails and suspecting that she was a lesbian, but Hepburn said she \"knew right away that [she] found him irresistible\". Tracy remained married throughout their relationship. Although he and his wife, Louise, had been living separate lives since the 1930s, there was never an official split and neither party pursued a divorce. Hepburn did not interfere.\nWith Tracy determined to conceal the relationship with Hepburn from his wife, it had to remain private. They were careful not to be seen in public together and maintained separate residences. Tracy suffered from a severe alcohol addiction and was extremely moody and frequently depressed; Hepburn described him as \"tortured\", and she devoted herself to making his life easier. Reports from people who saw them together describe how Hepburn's entire demeanor changed when around Tracy. She reportedly mothered and obeyed him, and he soon became dependent on her. They often spent significant stretches of time apart due to their work, especially in the 1950s when Hepburn frequently traveled abroad for film commitments.\nTracy's alcoholism took an immense toll on his health and in the early 1960s, Hepburn took a five-year break in her career to care for him. She moved into Tracy's house for this period and was with him when he died on June 10, 1967. Out of consideration for Tracy's family, she did not attend his funeral. It was only after Louise Tracy's death in 1983, that Hepburn began to speak publicly about her feelings for Tracy, though their relationship had been an open secret for many years. In response to the question of why she stayed with Tracy for so long, despite the nature of their relationship, she said, \"I honestly don't know. I can only say that I could never have left him.\" She claimed to not know how he felt about her, and that they \"just passed twenty-seven years together in what was to me absolute bliss\".\nFinal years and death.\nHepburn stated in her eighties, \"I have no fear of death. Must be wonderful, like a long sleep.\" Her health began to deteriorate not long after her final screen appearance, and she was hospitalized in March 1993 for exhaustion. In the winter of 1996, she was hospitalized with pneumonia. By 1997, she had become very weak and was speaking and eating very little, and it was feared she would die. She showed signs of dementia in her final years. By 2000, she was regarded by her niece to be a \"private person\". In July 2001, she was admitted to a hospital for pneumonia and a urinary tract infection. In May 2003, an aggressive tumor was found in Hepburn's neck. The decision was made not to medically intervene, and she died from cardiac arrest on June 29, 2003, at the Hepburn family home in Fenwick, Connecticut. She was buried in Cedar Hill Cemetery in Hartford. Hepburn requested there be no memorial service.\nHepburn's death received considerable public attention. Many tributes were held on television, and newspapers and magazines dedicated issues to the actress. American president George W. Bush said Hepburn \"will be remembered as one of the nation's artistic treasures\". In honor of her extensive theatre work, the lights of Broadway were dimmed for the evening of July 1, 2003.\nIn 2004, in accordance with Hepburn's wishes, her belongings were put up for auction with Sotheby's in New York City. The event garnered $5.8\u00a0million, which Hepburn willed to her family.\nActing style and screen persona.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Her best films were when she was presented as a woman on her high horse with slightly pretentious, often comically stated ideas about the world. It was for men to bring her down and get her to reveal herself as quite a good gal, sporty and democratic. We liked the idea that aristocratic people would be humanized by democratic values\u2014in her case, by slightly rough-necked and good-natured males.\"\n\u2014Film historian and critic Richard Schickel explains the typical Hepburn role and its appeal.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"I liked Katherine Hepburn's face on the screen, no matter what was said about her pretentiousness...\"\u2014Novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald in his \"The Crack-Up\", April 1936 Esquire\nAccording to reports, Hepburn was not an instinctive actor. She liked to study the text and character carefully beforehand, making sure she knew them thoroughly, and then to rehearse as much as possible and film multiple takes of a scene. With a genuine passion for acting she committed heavily to each role and insisted on learning any necessary skills and performing stunts herself. She was known to learn not only her own lines but also those of her co-stars. Commenting on her motivation, Stanley Kramer said, \"Work, work, work. She can work till everyone drops.\" Hepburn involved herself in the production of each of her films, making suggestions for the script and stating her opinion on everything from costumes to lighting to camerawork.\nThe characters Hepburn played were, with very few exceptions, wealthy and intelligent, and often strong and independent. These tough characters tended to be humbled in some form and revealed to have a hidden vulnerability. Garson Kanin described what he called \"the formula for a Hepburn success: A high-class, or stuck-up ... girl is brought down to earth by an earthy type, or a lowbrow ... or a cataclysmic situation. It seems to have worked time and time again.\" Due to this repeated character arc, Hepburn embodied the \"contradictions\" of the \"nature and status of women\", and the strong females she depicts are eventually \"restored to a safe position within the status quo\". Film critic Molly Haskell has commented on the importance of this to Hepburn's career: With an intimidating presence, it was necessary that her characters \"do some kind of self-abasement, to stay on the good side of the audience\".\nHepburn is one of the most celebrated American actresses, but she has also been criticized for a lack of versatility. Her on-screen persona closely matched her own real personality, something Hepburn admitted herself. In 1991 she told a journalist, \"I think I'm always the same. I had a very definite personality, and I liked material that showed that personality.\" Playwright and author David Macaray has said, \"Picture Katharine Hepburn in every movie she ever starred in, and ask yourself if she's not playing, essentially, the same part over and over\u00a0... Icon or no icon, let's not confuse a truly fascinating and unique woman with a superior actress.\" Another repeated criticism is that her demeanor was too cold. Writer and socialite Helen Lawrenson described Hepburn as \"the most egregious example\" of a classical Hollywood star receiving undue praise for their acting ability, viewing her more as a compelling personality than a distinguished acting talent.\nLegacy.\nHepburn is considered an important and influential cultural figure. Ros Horton and Sally Simmons included her in their book \"Women Who Changed The World\", which honors 50 women who helped shape world history and culture. She is also named in \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\"'s list of \"300 Women Who Changed the World\", \"Ladies Home Journal\"'s book \"100 Most Important Women of the 20th century\", \"Variety\" magazine's \"100 Icons of the Century\", and she is number 84 on VH1's list of the \"200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons of All Time\". In 1999, the American Film Institute named Hepburn the \"greatest American screen legend\" among females.\nRegarding Hepburn's film legacy, one of her biographers, Sheridan Morley, said she \"broke the mould\" for women in Hollywood, where she brought a new breed of strong-willed females to the screen. Film academic Andrew Britton wrote a monograph studying Hepburn's \"key presence within classical Hollywood, a consistent, potentially radical disturbance\", and pinpoints her \"central\" influence in bringing feminist issues to the screen.\nOff screen, Hepburn's lifestyle was ahead of her time, coming to symbolize the \"modern woman\" and playing a part in changing gender attitudes. Horton and Simmons write, \"Confident, intelligent and witty, four-time Oscar winner Katharine Hepburn defied convention throughout her professional and personal life ... Hepburn provided an image of an assertive woman whom [females] could watch and learn from.\" After Hepburn's death, film historian Jeanine Basinger stated, \"What she brought us was a new kind of heroine\u2014modern and independent. She was beautiful, but she did not rely on that.\" Mary McNamara, an entertainment journalist and reviewer for the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote, \"More than a movie star, Katharine Hepburn was the patron saint of the independent American female.\" She was not universally revered by feminists, however, who were angered by her public declarations that women \"cannot have it all\", meaning a family and a career.\nHepburn's legacy extends to fashion, where she pioneered wearing trousers at a time when it was a radical move for a woman. She helped make trousers acceptable for women, and fans began to imitate her clothing. In 1986 she received a lifetime achievement award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America in recognition of her influence on women's fashion.\nA number of Hepburn's films have become classics of American cinema, with four of her pictures (\"The African Queen\", \"The Philadelphia Story\", \"Bringing Up Baby\", and \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\") featured on the American Film Institute's list of the 100 Greatest American Films of all time. \"Adam's Rib\" and \"Woman of the Year\" were included in the AFI's list of the Greatest American Comedies. She is considered one of the most distinctive voices in film history with her clipped vocal style and patrician accent.\nMemorials.\nHepburn has been honored with several memorials. The Turtle Bay community in New York City, where she maintained a residence for over 60 years, dedicated a garden in her name located in Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld Plaza in 1997. After Hepburn's death in 2003, the intersection of East 49th Street and 2nd Avenue was renamed \"Katharine Hepburn Place\". Three years later Bryn Mawr College, Hepburn's alma mater, launched the Katharine Houghton Hepburn Center. It is dedicated to both the actress and her mother and encourages women to address important issues affecting their gender. The center awards the annual Katharine Hepburn Medal, which \"recognizes women whose lives, work and contributions embody the intelligence, drive and independence of the four-time-Oscar-winning actress\" and whose award recipients \"are chosen on the basis of their commitment and contributions to the Hepburn women's greatest passions\u2014civic engagement and the arts\". The Katharine Hepburn Cultural Arts Center was opened in 2009 in Old Saybrook, Connecticut, the location of the Hepburn family beach home, which she loved and later owned. The building includes a performance space and a Katharine Hepburn Museum that features personal letters, film memorabilia, costumes, and many personal effects.\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences library and the New York Public Library hold collections of Hepburn's personal papers. Selections from the New York collection, which documents Hepburn's theatrical career, were presented in a five-month exhibition, \"Katharine Hepburn: In Her Own Files\", in 2009. Other exhibitions have been held to showcase Hepburn's career. \"One Life: Kate, A Centennial Celebration\" was held at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington from November 2007 to September 2008. Kent State University exhibited a selection of her film and theatre costumes from October 2010 to September 2011 in \"Katharine Hepburn: Dressed for Stage and Screen\". Hepburn has also been honored with her own postal stamp as part of the \"Legends of Hollywood\" stamp series. In 2015, the British Film Institute held a two-month retrospective of Hepburn's work.\nCharacterizations.\nHepburn is the subject of a one-woman play, \"Tea at Five\", written by Matthew Lombardo. The first act features Hepburn in 1938, after being labeled \"box office poison\", and the second act in 1983, where she reflects on her life and career. It premiered in 2002 at the Hartford Stage. Hepburn has been portrayed in \"Tea at Five\" by Kate Mulgrew, Tovah Feldshuh, Stephanie Zimbalist, and Charles Busch. A revised version of the play, eliminating the first act and expanding the second, premiered on June 28, 2019, at Boston's Huntington Theater with Faye Dunaway playing Hepburn. Feldshuh also appeared as Hepburn in \"The Amazing Howard Hughes\", a 1977 television movie, while Mearle Ann Taylor later portrayed her in \"The Scarlett O'Hara War\" (1980). In Martin Scorsese's Howard Hughes biographical film \"The Aviator\", Hepburn was portrayed by Cate Blanchett, which earned her the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. This marked the first instance where the portrayal of an Academy Award-winning actress itself won an Academy Award.\nActing credits.\nDuring her 66-year career, Hepburn appeared in 44 feature films, 8 television movies, and 33 plays. Her movie career covered a range of genres, including screwball comedies, period dramas, and adaptations of works by top American playwrights. She appeared on film in every decade from the 1930s to the 1990s and on the stage in every decade from the 1920s to the 1980s, performing plays by Shakespeare and Shaw, and a Broadway musical.\nSelect filmography:\nSelect theatre roles:\nAwards and nominations.\nHepburn won four Academy Awards, the record number for a performer, and received a total of 12 Oscar nominations for Best Actress\u2014a number surpassed only by Meryl Streep. Hepburn also holds the record for the longest time span between first and last Oscar nominations, at 48 years. She received two awards and five nominations from the British Academy Film Awards, one award and six nominations from the Emmy Awards, eight Golden Globe Award nominations, two Tony Award nominations, and awards from the Cannes Film Festival, Venice Film Festival, the New York Film Critics Circle Awards, the People's Choice Awards, and others. Hepburn was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1979. She also won a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Screen Actors Guild Awards in 1979 and received the Kennedy Center Honors, which recognize a lifetime of accomplishments in the arts, in 1990.\nHepburn was recognized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for the following performances:\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "43339", "revid": "13249226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43339", "title": "Packet switching", "text": "Method for transmitting data over a computer network\nIn telecommunications, packet switching is a method of grouping data into short messages in fixed format, i.e., \"packets,\" that are transmitted over a telecommunications network. Packets consist of a header and a payload. Data in the header is used by networking hardware to direct the packet to its destination, where the payload is extracted and used by an operating system, application software, or higher layer protocols. Packet switching is the primary basis for data communications in computer networks worldwide.\nDuring the early 1960s, American engineer Paul Baran developed a concept he called \"distributed adaptive message block switching\" as part of a research program at the RAND Corporation, funded by the United States Department of Defense. His proposal was to provide a fault-tolerant, efficient method for communication of voice messages using low-cost hardware to route the message blocks across a distributed network. His ideas contradicted then-established principles of pre-allocation of network bandwidth, exemplified by the development of telecommunications in the Bell System. The new concept found little resonance among network implementers until the independent work of Welsh computer scientist Donald Davies at the National Physical Laboratory beginning in 1965. Davies developed the concept for data communication using software switches in a high-speed computer network and coined the term \"packet switching\". His work inspired numerous packet switching networks in the decade following, including the incorporation of the concept into the design of the ARPANET in the United States and the CYCLADES network in France. The ARPANET and CYCLADES were the primary precursor networks of the modern Internet.\nConcept.\nA simple definition of packet switching is:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The routing and transferring of data by means of addressed packets so that a channel is occupied during the transmission of the packet only, and upon completion of the transmission the channel is made available for the transfer of other traffic.\nPacket switching allows delivery of variable bit rate data streams, realized as sequences of short messages in fixed format, i.e. \"packets\", over a computer network which allocates transmission resources as needed using statistical multiplexing or dynamic bandwidth allocation techniques. As they traverse networking hardware, such as switches and routers, packets are received, buffered, queued, and retransmitted (stored and forwarded), resulting in variable latency and throughput depending on the link capacity and the traffic load on the network. Packets are normally forwarded by intermediate network nodes asynchronously using first-in, first-out buffering, but may be forwarded according to some scheduling discipline for fair queuing, traffic shaping, or for differentiated or guaranteed quality of service, such as weighted fair queuing or leaky bucket. Packet-based communication may be implemented with or without intermediate forwarding nodes (switches and routers). In case of a shared physical medium (such as radio or 10BASE5), the packets may be delivered according to a multiple access scheme.\nPacket switching contrasts with another principal networking paradigm, circuit switching, a method which pre-allocates dedicated network bandwidth specifically for each communication session, each having a constant bit rate and latency between nodes. In cases of billable services, such as cellular communication services, circuit switching is characterized by a fee per unit of connection time, even when no data is transferred, while packet switching may be characterized by a fee per unit of information transmitted, such as characters, packets, or messages.\nA packet switch has four components: input ports, output ports, routing processor, and switching fabric.\nHistory.\nInvention and development.\nThe concept of switching small blocks of data was first invented independently by Paul Baran at the RAND Corporation during the early 1960s in the US and Donald Davies at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in the UK in 1965.\nIn the late 1950s, the US Air Force established a wide area network for the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) radar defense system. Recognizing vulnerabilities in this network, the Air Force sought a system that might survive a nuclear attack to enable a response, thus diminishing the attractiveness of the first strike advantage by enemies (see Mutual assured destruction). In the early 1960s, Baran invented the concept of \"distributed adaptive message block switching\" in support of the Air Force initiative. The concept was first presented to the Air Force in the summer of 1961 as briefing B-265, later published as RAND report P-2626 in 1962, and finally in report RM 3420 in 1964. The reports describe a general architecture for a large-scale, distributed, survivable communications network. The proposal was composed of three key ideas: use of a decentralized network with multiple paths between any two points; dividing user messages into \"message blocks;\" and delivery of these messages by store and forward switching. Baran's network design was focused on digital communication of voice messages using hardware switches that were low-cost electronics. The ideas were not entirely original to Baran and the task to design a store and forward type of network was formulated by Baran's boss at RAND.\nChristopher Strachey, who became Oxford University's first Professor of Computation, filed a patent application in the United Kingdom for time-sharing in February 1959. In June that year, he gave a paper \"Time Sharing in Large Fast Computers\" at the UNESCO Information Processing Conference in Paris where he passed the concept on to J. C. R. Licklider. Licklider (along with John McCarthy) was instrumental in the development of time-sharing. After conversations with Licklider about time-sharing with remote computers in 1965, Davies independently invented a similar data communication concept. His insight was to use short messages in fixed format with high data transmission rates to achieve rapid communications. He went on to develop a more advanced design for a hierarchical, high-speed computer network including interface computers and communication protocols. He coined the term \"packet switching\", and proposed building a commercial nationwide data network in the UK. He gave a talk on the proposal in 1966, after which a person from the Ministry of Defence (MoD) told him about Baran's work.\nRoger Scantlebury, a member of Davies' team, presented their work (and referenced that of Baran) at the October 1967 Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP). At the conference, Scantlebury proposed packet switching for use in the ARPANET and persuaded Larry Roberts the economics were favorable to message switching. Davies had chosen some of the same parameters for his original network design as did Baran, such as a packet size of 1024 bits. To deal with packet permutations (due to dynamically updated route preferences) and datagram losses (unavoidable when fast sources send to a slow destinations), he assumed that \"all users of the network will provide themselves with some kind of error control\", thus inventing what came to be known as the end-to-end principle. Davies proposed that a local-area network should be built at the laboratory to serve the needs of NPL and prove the feasibility of packet switching. After a pilot experiment in early 1969, the NPL Data Communications Network began service in 1970. Davies was invited to Japan to give a series of lectures on packet switching. The NPL team carried out simulation work on datagrams and congestion in networks on a scale to provide data communication across the United Kingdom.\nLarry Roberts made the key decisions in the request for proposal to build the ARPANET. Roberts met Baran in February 1967, but did not discuss networks. He asked Frank Westervelt to explore the questions of message size and contents for the network, and to write a position paper on the intercomputer communication protocol including \u201cconventions for character and block transmission, error checking and re transmission, and computer and user identification.\" Roberts revised his initial design, which was to connect the host computers directly, to incorporate Wesley Clark's idea to use Interface Message Processors (IMPs) to create a message switching network, which he presented at SOSP. Roberts was known for making decisions quickly. Immediately after SOSP, he incorporated Davies' and Baran's concepts and designs for packet switching to enable the data communications on the network.\nA contemporary of Roberts' from MIT, Leonard Kleinrock had researched the application of queueing theory in the field of message switching for his doctoral dissertation in 1961\u201362 and published it as a book in 1964. Davies, in his 1966 paper on packet switching, applied Kleinorck's techniques to show that \"there is an ample margin between the estimated performance of the [packet-switched] system and the stated requirement\" in terms of a satisfactory response time for a human user. This addressed a key question about the viability of computer networking. Larry Roberts brought Kleinrock into the ARPANET project informally in early 1967. Roberts and Taylor recognized the issue of response time was important, but did not apply Kleinrock's methods to assess this and based their design on a store-and-forward system that was not intended for real-time computing. After SOSP, and after Roberts' direction to use packet switching, Kleinrock sought input from Baran and proposed to retain Baran and RAND as advisors. The ARPANET working group assigned Kleinrock responsibility to prepare a report on software for the IMP. In 1968, Roberts awarded Kleinrock a contract to establish a Network Measurement Center (NMC) at UCLA to measure and model the performance of packet switching in the ARPANET. \nBolt Beranek &amp; Newman (BBN) won the contract to build the network. Designed principally by Bob Kahn, it was the first wide-area packet-switched network with distributed control. The BBN \"IMP Guys\" independently developed significant aspects of the network's internal operation, including the routing algorithm, flow control, software design, and network control. The UCLA NMC and the BBN team also investigated network congestion. The Network Working Group, led by Steve Crocker, a graduate student of Kleinrock's at UCLA, developed the host-to-host protocol, the Network Control Program, which was approved by Barry Wessler for ARPA, after he ordered certain more exotic elements to be dropped. In 1970, Kleinrock extended his earlier analytic work on message switching to packet switching in the ARPANET. His work influenced the development of the ARPANET and packet-switched networks generally. \nThe ARPANET was demonstrated at the International Conference on Computer Communication (ICCC) in Washington in October 1972. However, fundamental questions about the design of packet-switched networks remained.\nRoberts presented the idea of packet switching to communication industry professionals in the early 1970s. Before ARPANET was operating, they argued that the router buffers would quickly run out. After the ARPANET was operating, they argued packet switching would never be economic without the government subsidy. Baran had faced the same rejection and thus failed to convince the military into constructing a packet switching network in the 1960s.\nThe CYCLADES network was designed by Louis Pouzin in the early 1970s to study internetworking. It was the first to implement the end-to-end principle of Davies, and make the host computers responsible for the reliable delivery of data on a packet-switched network, rather than this being a service of the network itself. His team was thus first to tackle the highly-complex problem of providing user applications with a reliable virtual circuit service while using a best-effort service, an early contribution to what will be the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).\nBob Metcalfe and others at Xerox PARC outlined the idea of Ethernet and the PARC Universal Packet (PUP) for internetworking.\nIn May 1974, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn described the Transmission Control Program, an internetworking protocol for sharing resources using packet-switching among the nodes. The specifications of the TCP were then published in (\"Specification of Internet Transmission Control Program\"), written by Vint Cerf, Yogen Dalal and Carl Sunshine in December 1974. \nThe X.25 protocol, developed by R\u00e9mi Despr\u00e9s and others, was built on the concept of virtual circuits. In the mid-late 1970s and early 1980s, national and international public data networks emerged using X.25 which was developed with participation from France, the UK, Japan, USA and Canada. It was complemented with X.75 to enable internetworking. \nPacket switching was shown to be optimal in the Huffman coding sense in 1978. \nIn the late 1970s, the monolithic Transmission Control Program was layered as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), atop the Internet Protocol (IP). Many Internet pioneers developed this into the Internet protocol suite and the associated Internet architecture and governance that emerged in the 1980s.\nFor a period in the 1980s and early 1990s, the network engineering community was polarized over the implementation of competing protocol suites, commonly known as the Protocol Wars. It was unclear which of the Internet protocol suite and the OSI model would result in the best and most robust computer networks.\nLeonard Kleinrock carried out theoretical work at UCLA during the 1970s analyzing throughput and delay in the ARPANET. His theoretical work on hierarchical routing with student Farouk Kamoun became critical to the operation of the Internet. Kleinrock published hundreds of research papers, which ultimately launched a new field of research on the theory and application of queuing theory to computer networks.\nComplementary metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor (CMOS) VLSI (very-large-scale integration) technology led to the development of high-speed broadband packet switching during the 1980s\u20131990s.\nThe \"paternity dispute\".\nRoberts claimed in later years that, by the time of the October 1967 SOSP, he already had the concept of packet switching in mind (although not yet named and not written down in his paper published at the conference, which a number of sources describe as \"vague\"), and that this originated with his old colleague, Kleinrock, who had written about such concepts in his Ph.D. research in 1961-2. In 1997, along with seven other Internet pioneers, Roberts and Kleinrock co-wrote \"Brief History of the Internet\" published by the Internet Society. In it, Kleinrock is described as having \"published the first paper on packet switching theory in July 1961 and the first book on the subject in 1964\". Many sources about the history of the Internet began to reflect these claims as uncontroversial facts. This became the subject of what Katie Hafner called a \"paternity dispute\" in The New York Times in 2001.\nThe disagreement about Kleinrock's contribution to packet switching dates back to a version of the above claim made on Kleinrock's profile on the UCLA Computer Science department website sometime in the 1990s. Here, he was referred to as the \"Inventor of the Internet Technology\". The webpage's depictions of Kleinrock's achievements provoked anger among some early Internet pioneers. The dispute over priority became a public issue after Donald Davies posthumously published a paper in 2001 in which he denied that Kleinrock's work was related to packet switching. Davies also described ARPANET project manager Larry Roberts as supporting Kleinrock, referring to Roberts' writings online and Kleinrock's UCLA webpage profile as \"very misleading\". Walter Isaacson wrote that Kleinrock's claims \"led to an outcry among many of the other Internet pioneers, who publicly attacked Kleinrock and said that his brief mention of breaking messages into smaller pieces did not come close to being a proposal for packet switching\". \nDavies' paper reignited a previous dispute over who deserves credit for getting the ARPANET online between engineers at Bolt, Beranek, and Newman (BBN) who had been involved in building and designing the ARPANET IMP on the one side, and ARPA-related researchers on the other. This earlier dispute is exemplified by BBN's Will Crowther, who in a 1990 oral history described Paul Baran's packet switching design (which he called hot-potato routing), as \"crazy\" and non-sensical, despite the ARPA team having advocated for it. The reignited debate caused other former BBN employees to make their concerns known, including Alex McKenzie, who followed Davies in disputing that Kleinrock's work was related to packet switching, stating \"... there is nothing in the entire 1964 book that suggests, analyzes, or alludes to the idea of packetization\".\nFormer IPTO director Bob Taylor also joined the debate, stating that \"authors who have interviewed dozens of Arpanet pioneers know very well that the Kleinrock-Roberts claims are not believed\". Walter Isaacson notes that \"until the mid-1990s Kleinrock had credited [Baran and Davies] with coming up with the idea of packet switching\".\nA subsequent version of Kleinrock's biography webpage was copyrighted in 2009 by Kleinrock. He was called on to defend his position over subsequent decades. In 2023, he acknowledged that his published work in the early 1960s was about message switching and claimed he was thinking about packet switching. Primary sources and historians recognize Baran and Davies for independently inventing the concept of digital packet switching used in modern computer networking including the ARPANET and the Internet.\nKleinrock has received many awards for his ground-breaking applied mathematical research on packet switching, carried out in the 1970s, which was an extension of his pioneering work in the early 1960s on the optimization of message delays in communication networks. However, Kleinrock's claims that his work in the early 1960s originated the concept of packet switching and that his work was a source of the packet switching concepts used in the ARPANET have affected sources on the topic, which has created methodological challenges in the historiography of the Internet. Historian Andrew L. Russell said \"'Internet history' also suffers from a ... methodological, problem: it tends to be too close to its sources. Many Internet pioneers are alive, active, and eager to shape the histories that describe their accomplishments. Many museums and historians are equally eager to interview the pioneers and to publicize their stories\".\nConnectionless and connection-oriented modes.\nPacket switching may be classified into connectionless packet switching, also known as datagram switching, and connection-oriented packet switching, also known as virtual circuit switching. Examples of connectionless systems are Ethernet, IP, and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). Connection-oriented systems include X.25, Frame Relay, Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), and TCP.\nIn connectionless mode each packet is labeled with a destination address, source address, and port numbers. It may also be labeled with the sequence number of the packet. This information eliminates the need for a pre-established path to help the packet find its way to its destination, but means that more information is needed in the packet header, which is therefore larger. The packets are routed individually, sometimes taking different paths resulting in out-of-order delivery. At the destination, the original message may be reassembled in the correct order, based on the packet sequence numbers. Thus a virtual circuit carrying a byte stream is provided to the application by a transport layer protocol, although the network only provides a connectionless network layer service.\nConnection-oriented transmission requires a setup phase to establish the parameters of communication before any packet is transferred. The signaling protocols used for setup allow the application to specify its requirements and discover link parameters. Acceptable values for service parameters may be negotiated. The packets transferred may include a connection identifier rather than address information and the packet header can be smaller, as it only needs to contain this code and any information, such as length, timestamp, or sequence number, which is different for different packets. In this case, address information is only transferred to each node during the connection setup phase, when the route to the destination is discovered and an entry is added to the switching table in each network node through which the connection passes. When a connection identifier is used, routing a packet requires the node to look up the connection identifier in a table.\nConnection-oriented transport layer protocols such as TCP provide a connection-oriented service by using an underlying connectionless network. In this case, the end-to-end principle dictates that the end nodes, not the network itself, are responsible for the connection-oriented behavior.\nPacket switching in networks.\nIn telecommunication networks, packet switching is used to optimize the usage of channel capacity and increase robustness. Compared to circuit switching, packet switching is highly dynamic, allocating channel capacity based on usage instead of explicit reservations. This can reduce wasted capacity caused by underutilized reservations at the cost of removing bandwidth guarantees. In practice, congestion control is generally used in IP networks to dynamically negotiate capacity between connections. Packet switching may also increase the robustness of networks in the face of failures. If a node fails, connections do not need to be interrupted, as packets may be routed around the failure.\nPacket switching is used in the Internet and most local area networks. The Internet is implemented by the Internet Protocol Suite using a variety of link layer technologies. For example, Ethernet and Frame Relay are common. Newer mobile phone technologies (e.g., GSM, LTE) also use packet switching. Packet switching is associated with connectionless networking because, in these systems, no connection agreement needs to be established between communicating parties prior to exchanging data.\nX.25, the international CCITT standard of 1976, is a notable use of packet switching in that it provides to users a service of flow-controlled virtual circuits. These virtual circuits reliably carry variable-length packets with data order preservation. DATAPAC in Canada was the first public network to support X.25, followed by TRANSPAC in France.\nAsynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is another virtual circuit technology. It differs from X.25 in that it uses small fixed-length packets (cells), and that the network imposes no flow control to users.\nTechnologies such as MPLS and the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) create virtual circuits on top of datagram networks. MPLS and its predecessors, as well as ATM, have been called \"fast packet\" technologies. MPLS, indeed, has been called \"ATM without cells\". Virtual circuits are especially useful in building robust failover mechanisms and allocating bandwidth for delay-sensitive applications.\nPacket-switched networks.\nDonald Davies' work in the late 1960s on data communications and computer network design became well known in the United States, Europe and Japan. It was the \"cornerstone\" that inspired numerous packet switching networks in the decade following. \nThe history of packet-switched networks can be divided into three overlapping eras: early networks before the introduction of X.25; the X.25 era when many postal, telephone, and telegraph (PTT) companies provided public data networks with X.25 interfaces; and the Internet era which initially competed with the OSI model.\nEarly networks.\nResearch into packet switching at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) began with a proposal for a wide-area network in 1965, and a local-area network in 1966. ARPANET funding was secured in 1966 by Bob Taylor, and planning began in 1967 when he hired Larry Roberts. The NPL network followed by the ARPANET became operational in 1969, the first two networks to use packet switching. Larry Roberts said many of the packet switching networks built in the 1970s were similar \"in nearly all respects\" to Donald Davies' original 1965 design. The ARPANET and Louis Pouzin's CYCLADES were the primary precursor networks of the modern Internet. CYCLADES, unlike ARPANET, was explicitly designed to research internetworking.\nBefore the introduction of X.25 in 1976, about twenty different network technologies had been developed. Two fundamental differences involved the division of functions and tasks between the hosts at the edge of the network and the network core. In the datagram system, operating according to the end-to-end principle, the hosts have the responsibility to ensure orderly delivery of packets. In the virtual call system, the network guarantees sequenced delivery of data to the host. This results in a simpler host interface but complicates the network. The X.25 protocol suite uses this network type.\nAppleTalk.\nAppleTalk is a proprietary suite of networking protocols developed by Apple in 1985 for Apple Macintosh computers. It was the primary protocol used by Apple devices through the 1980s and 1990s. AppleTalk included features that allowed local area networks to be established \"ad hoc\" without the requirement for a centralized router or server. The AppleTalk system automatically assigned addresses, updated the distributed namespace, and configured any required inter-network routing. It was a plug-n-play system.\nAppleTalk implementations were also released for the IBM PC and compatibles, and the Apple IIGS. AppleTalk support was available in most networked printers, especially laser printers, some file servers and routers.\nThe protocol was designed to be simple, autoconfiguring, and not require servers or other specialized services to work. These benefits also created drawbacks, as Appletalk tended not to use bandwidth efficiently. AppleTalk support was terminated in 2009.\nARPANET.\nThe ARPANET was a progenitor network of the Internet and one of the first networks, along with ARPA's SATNET, to run the TCP/IP suite using packet switching technologies.\nBNRNET.\nBNRNET was a network which Bell-Northern Research developed for internal use. It initially had only one host but was designed to support many hosts. BNR later made major contributions to the CCITT X.25 project.\nCambridge Ring.\nThe Cambridge Ring was an experimental ring network developed at the Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge. It operated from 1974 until the 1980s.\nCompuServe.\nCompuServe developed its own packet switching network, implemented on DEC PDP-11 minicomputers acting as network nodes that were installed throughout the US (and later, in other countries) and interconnected. Over time, the CompuServe network evolved into a complicated multi-tiered network incorporating ATM, Frame Relay, IP and X.25 technologies.\nCYCLADES.\nThe CYCLADES packet switching network was a French research network designed and directed by Louis Pouzin. First demonstrated in 1973, it was developed to explore alternatives to the early ARPANET design and to support network research generally. It was the first network to use the end-to-end principle and make the hosts responsible for reliable delivery of data, rather than the network itself. Concepts of this network influenced later ARPANET architecture.\nDECnet.\nDECnet is a suite of network protocols created by Digital Equipment Corporation, originally released in 1975 in order to connect two PDP-11 minicomputers. It evolved into one of the first peer-to-peer network architectures, thus transforming DEC into a networking powerhouse in the 1980s. Initially built with three layers, it later (1982) evolved into a seven-layer OSI-compliant networking protocol. The DECnet protocols were designed entirely by Digital Equipment Corporation. However, DECnet Phase II (and later) were open standards with published specifications, and several implementations were developed outside DEC, including one for Linux.\nDDX-1.\nDDX-1 was an experimental network from Nippon PTT. It mixed circuit switching and packet switching. It was succeeded by DDX-2.\nEIN.\nThe European Informatics Network (EIN), originally called COST 11, was a project beginning in 1971 to link networks in Britain, France, Italy, Switzerland and Euratom. Six other European countries also participated in the research on network protocols. Derek Barber directed the project, and Roger Scantlebury led the UK technical contribution; both were from NPL. The contract for its implementation was awarded to an Anglo French consortium led by the UK systems house Logica and Sesa and managed by Andrew Karney. Work began in 1973 and it became operational in 1976 including nodes linking the NPL network and CYCLADES. Barber proposed and implemented a mail protocol for EIN. The transport protocol of the EIN helped to launch the INWG and X.25 protocols. EIN was replaced by Euronet in 1979.\nEPSS.\nThe Experimental Packet Switched Service (EPSS) was an experiment of the UK Post Office Telecommunications. It was the first public data network in the UK when it began operating in 1976. Ferranti supplied the hardware and software. The handling of link control messages (acknowledgements and flow control) was different from that of most other networks.\nGEIS.\nAs General Electric Information Services (GEIS), General Electric was a major international provider of information services. The company originally designed a telephone network to serve as its internal (albeit continent-wide) voice telephone network.\nIn 1965, at the instigation of Warner Sinback, a data network based on this voice-phone network was designed to connect GE's four computer sales and service centers (Schenectady, New York, Chicago, and Phoenix) to facilitate a computer time-sharing service.\nAfter going international some years later, GEIS created a network data center near Cleveland, Ohio. Very little has been published about the internal details of their network. The design was hierarchical with redundant communication links.\nIPSANET.\nIPSANET was a semi-private network constructed by I. P. Sharp Associates to serve their time-sharing customers. It became operational in May 1976.\nIPX/SPX.\nThe Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX) and Sequenced Packet Exchange (SPX) are Novell networking protocols from the 1980s derived from Xerox Network Systems' IDP and SPP protocols, respectively which date back to the 1970s. IPX/SPX was used primarily on networks using the Novell NetWare operating systems.\nMerit Network.\nMerit Network, an independent nonprofit organization governed by Michigan's public universities, was formed in 1966 as the Michigan Educational Research Information Triad to explore computer networking between three of Michigan's public universities as a means to help the state's educational and economic development. With initial support from the State of Michigan and the National Science Foundation (NSF), the packet-switched network was first demonstrated in December 1971 when an interactive host-to-host connection was made between the IBM mainframe systems at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and Wayne State University in Detroit. In October 1972, connections to the CDC mainframe at Michigan State University in East Lansing completed the triad. Over the next several years, in addition to host-to-host interactive connections, the network was enhanced to support terminal-to-host connections, host-to-host batch connections (remote job submission, remote printing, batch file transfer), interactive file transfer, gateways to the Tymnet and Telenet public data networks, X.25 host attachments, gateways to X.25 data networks, Ethernet attached hosts, and eventually TCP/IP; additionally, public universities in Michigan joined the network. All of this set the stage for Merit's role in the NSFNET project starting in the mid-1980s.\nNPL.\nDonald Davies of the National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom) designed and proposed a national commercial data network based on packet switching in 1965. The proposal was not taken up nationally but the following year, he designed a local network using \"interface computers\", today known as routers, to serve the needs of NPL and prove the feasibility of packet switching.\nBy 1968 Davies had begun building the NPL network to meet the needs of the multidisciplinary laboratory and prove the technology under operational conditions. In 1969, the NPL, followed by the ARPANET, were the first two networks to use packet switching. By 1976, 12 computers and 75 terminal devices were attached, and more were added until the network was replaced in 1986. NPL was the first to use high-speed links.\nOctopus.\nOctopus was a local network at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. It connected sundry hosts at the lab to interactive terminals and various computer peripherals including a bulk storage system.\nPhilips Research.\nPhilips Research Laboratories in Redhill, Surrey developed a packet switching network for internal use. It was a datagram network with a single switching node.\nPUP.\nPARC Universal Packet (PUP or Pup) was one of the two earliest internetworking protocol suites; it was created by researchers at Xerox PARC in the mid-1970s. The entire suite provided routing and packet delivery, as well as higher level functions such as a reliable byte stream, along with numerous applications. Further developments led to Xerox Network Systems (XNS).\nRCP.\nRCP was an experimental network created by the French PTT. It was used to gain experience with packet switching technology before the specification of the TRANSPAC public network was frozen. RCP was a virtual-circuit network in contrast to CYCLADES which was based on datagrams. RCP emphasised terminal-to-host and terminal-to-terminal connection; CYCLADES was concerned with host-to-host communication. RCP influenced the X.25 specification, which was deployed on TRANSPAC and other public data networks.\nRETD.\nRed Especial de Transmisi\u00f3n de Datos (RETD) was a network developed by Compa\u00f1\u00eda Telef\u00f3nica Nacional de Espa\u00f1a. It became operational in 1972 and thus was the first public network.\nSCANNET.\n\"The experimental packet-switched Nordic telecommunication network SCANNET was implemented in Nordic technical libraries in the 1970s, and it included first Nordic electronic journal Extemplo. Libraries were also among first ones in universities to accommodate microcomputers for public use in the early 1980s.\"\nSITA HLN.\nSITA is a consortium of airlines. Its High Level Network (HLN) became operational in 1969. Although organised to act like a packet-switching network, it still used message switching. As with many non-academic networks, very little has been published about it.\nSRCnet/SERCnet.\nA number of computer facilities serving the Science Research Council (SRC) community in the United Kingdom developed beginning in the early 1970s. Each had their own star network (ULCC London, UMRCC Manchester, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory). There were also regional networks centred on Bristol (on which work was initiated in the late 1960s) followed in the mid-late 1970s by Edinburgh, the Midlands and Newcastle. These groups of institutions shared resources to provide better computing facilities than could be afforded individually. The networks were each based on one manufacturer's standards and were mutually incompatible and overlapping. In 1981, the SRC was renamed the Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC). In the early 1980s a standardisation and interconnection effort started, hosted on an expansion of the SERCnet research network and based on the Coloured Book protocols, later evolving into JANET.\nSystems Network Architecture.\nSystems Network Architecture (SNA) is IBM's proprietary networking architecture created in 1974. An IBM customer could acquire hardware and software from IBM and lease private lines from a common carrier to construct a private network.\nTelenet.\nTelenet was the first FCC-licensed public data network in the United States. Telenet was incorporated in 1973 and started operations in 1975. It was founded by Bolt Beranek &amp; Newman with Larry Roberts as CEO as a means of making packet switching technology public. Telenet initially used a proprietary Virtual circuit host interface, but changed it to X.25 and the terminal interface to X.29 after their standardization in CCITT. It went public in 1979 and was then sold to GTE.\nTymnet.\nTymnet was an international data communications network headquartered in San Jose, CA. In 1969, it began install a network based on minicomputers to connect timesharing terminals to its central computers. The network used store-and-forward and voice-grade lines. Routing was not distributed, rather it was established by a central supervisor on a call-by-call basis.\nX.25 era.\nThere were two kinds of X.25 networks. Some such as DATAPAC and TRANSPAC were initially implemented with an X.25 external interface. Some older networks such as TELENET and TYMNET were modified to provide an X.25 host interface in addition to older host connection schemes. DATAPAC was developed by Bell-Northern Research which was a joint venture of Bell Canada (a common carrier) and Northern Telecom (a telecommunications equipment supplier). Northern Telecom sold several DATAPAC clones to foreign PTTs including the Deutsche Bundespost. X.75 and X.121 allowed the interconnection of national X.25 networks.\nAUSTPAC.\nAUSTPAC was an Australian public X.25 network operated by Telstra. Established by Telstra's predecessor Telecom Australia in the early 1980s, AUSTPAC was Australia's first public packet-switched data network and supported applications such as on-line betting, financial applications\u2014the Australian Taxation Office made use of AUSTPAC\u2014and remote terminal access to academic institutions, who maintained their connections to AUSTPAC up until the mid-late 1990s in some cases. Access was via a dial-up terminal to a PAD, or, by linking a permanent X.25 node to the network.\nConnNet.\nConnNet was a network operated by the Southern New England Telephone Company serving the state of Connecticut. Launched on March 11, 1985, it was the first local public packet-switched network in the United States.\nDatanet 1.\nDatanet 1 was the public switched data network operated by the Dutch PTT Telecom (now known as KPN). Strictly speaking Datanet 1 only referred to the network and the connected users via leased lines (using the X.121 DNIC 2041), the name also referred to the public PAD service \"Telepad\" (using the DNIC 2049). And because the main Videotex service used the network and modified PAD devices as infrastructure the name Datanet 1 was used for these services as well.\nDATAPAC.\nDATAPAC was the first operational X.25 network (1976). It covered major Canadian cities and was eventually extended to smaller centers.\nDatex-P.\nDeutsche Bundespost operated the Datex-P national network in Germany. The technology was acquired from Northern Telecom.\nEirpac.\nEirpac is the Irish public switched data network supporting X.25 and X.28. It was launched in 1984, replacing Euronet. Eirpac is run by Eircom.\nEuronet.\nNine member states of the European Economic Community contracted with Logica and the French company SESA to set up a joint venture in 1975 to undertake the \"Euronet\" development, using X.25 protocols to form virtual circuits. It was to replace EIN and established a network in 1979 linking a number of European countries until 1984 when the network was handed over to national PTTs.\nHIPA-NET.\nHitachi designed a private network system for sale as a turnkey package to multi-national organizations. In addition to providing X.25 packet switching, message switching software was also included. Messages were buffered at the nodes adjacent to the sending and receiving terminals. Switched virtual calls were not supported, but through the use of \"logical ports\" an originating terminal could have a menu of pre-defined destination terminals.\nIberpac.\nIberpac is the Spanish public packet-switched network, providing X.25 services. It was based on RETD which was operational since 1972. Iberpac was run by Telefonica.\nIPSS.\nIn 1978, X.25 provided the first international and commercial packet-switching network, the International Packet Switched Service (IPSS).\nJANET.\nJANET was the UK academic and research network, linking all universities, higher education establishments, and publicly funded research laboratories following its launch in 1984. The X.25 network, which used the Coloured Book protocols, was based mainly on GEC 4000 series switches, and ran X.25 links at up to 8 Mbit/s in its final phase before being converted to an IP-based network in 1991. The JANET network grew out of the 1970s SRCnet, later called SERCnet.\nPSS.\nPacket Switch Stream (PSS) was the Post Office Telecommunications (later to become British Telecom) national X.25 network with a DNIC of 2342. British Telecom renamed PSS Global Network Service (GNS), but the PSS name has remained better known. PSS also included public dial-up PAD access, and various InterStream gateways to other services such as Telex.\nREXPAC.\nREXPAC was the nationwide experimental packet switching data network in Brazil, developed by the research and development center of Telebr\u00e1s, the state-owned public telecommunications provider.\nSITA Data Transport Network.\nSITA is a consortium of airlines. Its Data Transport Network adopted X.25 in 1981, becoming the world's most extensive packet-switching network. As with many non-academic networks, very little has been published about it.\nTRANSPAC.\nTRANSPAC was the national X.25 network in France. It was developed locally at about the same time as DATAPAC in Canada. The development was done by the French PTT and influenced by its preceding experimental network RCP. It began operation in 1978, and served commercial users and, after Minitel began, consumers.\nTymnet.\nTymnet utilized virtual call packet switched technology including X.25, SNA/SDLC, BSC and ASCII interfaces to connect host computers (servers) at thousands of large companies, educational institutions, and government agencies. Users typically connected via dial-up connections or dedicated asynchronous serial connections. The business consisted of a large public network that supported dial-up users and a private network business that allowed government agencies and large companies (mostly banks and airlines) to build their own dedicated networks. The private networks were often connected via gateways to the public network to reach locations not on the private network. Tymnet was also connected to dozens of other public networks in the U.S. and internationally via X.25/X.75 gateways.\nUNINETT.\nUNINETT was a wide-area Norwegian packet-switched network established through a joint effort between Norwegian universities, research institutions and the Norwegian Telecommunication administration. The original network was based on X.25; Internet protocols were adopted later.\nVENUS-P.\nVENUS-P was an international X.25 network that operated from April 1982 through March 2006. At its subscription peak in 1999, VENUS-P connected 207 networks in 87 countries.\nXNS.\nXerox Network Systems (XNS) was a protocol suite promulgated by Xerox, which provided routing and packet delivery, as well as higher-level functions such as a reliable stream, and remote procedure calls. It was developed from PARC Universal Packet (PUP).\nInternet era.\nWhen Internet connectivity was made available to anyone who could pay for an Internet service provider subscription, the distinctions between national networks blurred. The user no longer saw network identifiers such as the DNIC. Some older technologies such as circuit switching have resurfaced with new names such as fast packet switching. Researchers have created some experimental networks to complement the existing Internet.\nCSNET.\nThe Computer Science Network (CSNET) was a computer network funded by the NSF that began operation in 1981. Its purpose was to extend networking benefits for computer science departments at academic and research institutions that could not be directly connected to ARPANET due to funding or authorization limitations. It played a significant role in spreading awareness of, and access to, national networking and was a major milestone on the path to the development of the global Internet.\nInternet2.\nInternet2 is a not-for-profit United States computer networking consortium led by members from the research and education communities, industry, and government. The Internet2 community, in partnership with Qwest, built the first Internet2 Network, called Abilene, in 1998 and was a prime investor in the National LambdaRail (NLR) project. In 2006, Internet2 announced a partnership with Level 3 Communications to launch a brand new nationwide network, boosting its capacity from 10 to 100 Gbit/s. In October, 2007, Internet2 officially retired Abilene and now refers to its new, higher capacity network as the Internet2 Network.\nNSFNET.\nThe National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) was a program of coordinated, evolving projects sponsored by the NSF beginning in 1985 to promote advanced research and education networking in the United States. NSFNET was also the name given to several nationwide backbone networks, operating at speeds of 56 kbit/s, 1.5 Mbit/s (T1), and 45 Mbit/s (T3), that were constructed to support NSF's networking initiatives from 1985 to 1995. Initially created to link researchers to the nation's NSF-funded supercomputing centers, through further public funding and private industry partnerships it developed into a major part of the Internet backbone.\nNSFNET regional networks.\nIn addition to the five NSF supercomputer centers, NSFNET provided connectivity to eleven regional networks and through these networks to many smaller regional and campus networks in the United States. The NSFNET regional networks were:\nNational LambdaRail.\nThe National LambdaRail (NRL) was launched in September 2003. It is a 12,000-mile high-speed national computer network owned and operated by the US research and education community that runs over fiber-optic lines. It was the first transcontinental 10 Gigabit Ethernet network. It operates with an aggregate capacity of up to 1.6 Tbit/s and a 40 Gbit/s bitrate. NLR ceased operations in March 2014.\nTransPAC2, and TransPAC3.\nTransPAC2 is a high-speed international Internet service connecting research and education networks in the Asia-Pacific region to those in the US. TransPAC3 is part of the NSF's International Research Network Connections (IRNC) program.\nVery high-speed Backbone Network Service (vBNS).\nThe Very high-speed Backbone Network Service (vBNS) came on line in April 1995 as part of a NSF sponsored project to provide high-speed interconnection between NSF-sponsored supercomputing centers and select access points in the United States. The network was engineered and operated by MCI Telecommunications under a cooperative agreement with the NSF. By 1998, the vBNS had grown to connect more than 100 universities and research and engineering institutions via 12 national points of presence with DS-3 (45 Mbit/s), OC-3c (155 Mbit/s), and OC-12 (622 Mbit/s) links on an all OC-12 backbone, a substantial engineering feat for that time. The vBNS installed one of the first ever production OC-48 (2.5 Gbit/s) IP links in February 1999 and went on to upgrade the entire backbone to OC-48.\nIn June 1999 MCI WorldCom introduced vBNS+ which allowed attachments to the vBNS network by organizations that were not approved by or receiving support from NSF. After the expiration of the NSF agreement, the vBNS largely transitioned to providing service to the government. Most universities and research centers migrated to the Internet2 educational backbone. In January 2006, when MCI and Verizon merged, vBNS+ became a service of Verizon Business.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is used in virtual private networks (VPNs).\nIPsec includes protocols for establishing mutual authentication between agents at the beginning of a session and negotiation of cryptographic keys to use during the session. IPsec can protect data flows between a pair of hosts (\"host-to-host\"), between a pair of security gateways (\"network-to-network\"), or between a security gateway and a host (\"network-to-host\").\nIPsec uses cryptographic security services to protect communications over Internet Protocol (IP) networks. It supports network-level peer authentication, data origin authentication, data integrity, data confidentiality (encryption), and protection from replay attacks.\nThe protocol was designed by a committee instead of being designed via a competition. Some experts criticized it, stating that it is complex and with a lot of options, which has a devastating effect on a security standard. There is alleged interference of the NSA to weaken its security features.\nHistory.\nStarting in the early 1970s, the Advanced Research Projects Agency sponsored a series of experimental ARPANET encryption devices, at first for native ARPANET packet encryption and subsequently for TCP/IP packet encryption; some of these were certified and fielded. From 1986 to 1991, the NSA sponsored the development of security protocols for the Internet under its Secure Data Network Systems (SDNS) program. This brought together various vendors including Motorola who produced a network encryption device in 1988. The work was openly published from about 1988 by NIST and, of these, \"Security Protocol at Layer 3\" (SP3) would eventually morph into the ISO standard Network Layer Security Protocol (NLSP).\nIn 1992, the US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) was funded by DARPA CSTO to implement IPv6 and to research and implement IP encryption in 4.4 BSD, supporting both SPARC and x86 CPU architectures. DARPA made its implementation freely available via MIT. Under NRL's DARPA-funded research effort, NRL developed the IETF standards-track specifications (RFC 1825 through RFC 1827) for IPsec. NRL's IPsec implementation was described in their paper in the 1996 USENIX Conference Proceedings. NRL's open-source IPsec implementation was made available online by MIT and became the basis for most initial commercial implementations.\nThe Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) formed the IP Security Working Group in 1992 to standardize openly specified security extensions to IP, called \"IPsec\". The NRL developed standards were published by the IETF as RFC 1825 through RFC 1827.\nSecurity architecture.\nThe initial IPv4 suite was developed with few security provisions. As a part of the IPv4 enhancement, IPsec is a layer 3 OSI model or internet layer end-to-end security scheme. In contrast, while some other Internet security systems in widespread use operate above the network layer, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) that operates above the transport layer and Secure Shell (SSH) that operates at the application layer, IPsec can automatically secure applications at the internet layer.\nIPsec is an open standard as a part of the IPv4 suite and uses the following protocols to perform various functions:\nAuthentication Header.\nThe Security Authentication Header (AH) was developed at the US Naval Research Laboratory in the early 1990s and is derived in part from previous IETF standards' work for authentication of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) version 2. Authentication Header (AH) is a member of the IPsec protocol suite. AH ensures connectionless integrity by using a hash function and a secret shared key in the AH algorithm. AH also guarantees the data origin by authenticating IP packets. Optionally a sequence number can protect the IPsec packet's contents against replay attacks, using the sliding window technique and discarding old packets.\nAH operates directly on top of IP, using IP protocol number 51.\nThe following AH packet diagram shows how an AH packet is constructed and interpreted:\n!style=\"min-width:42px; border-bottom:none; border-right:none;\"|\"Offset\"\n!style=\"border-left:none;\"|Octet\n!colspan=\"8\"|0\n!colspan=\"8\"|1\n!colspan=\"8\"|2\n!colspan=\"8\"|3\n!style=\"min-width: 42px;border-top: none;\"|Octet\n!style=\"min-width: 42px;\"|Bit\n!style=\"min-width:11px;\"|0\n!style=\"min-width:11px;\"|1\n!style=\"min-width:11px;\"|2\n!style=\"min-width:11px;\"|3\n!style=\"min-width:11px;\"|4\n!style=\"min-width:11px;\"|5\n!style=\"min-width:11px;\"|6\n!style=\"min-width:11px;\"|7\n!style=\"min-width:11px;\"|8\n!style=\"min-width:11px;\"|9\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|10\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|11\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|12\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|13\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|14\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|15\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|16\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|17\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|18\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|19\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|20\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|21\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|22\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|23\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|24\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|25\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|26\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|27\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|28\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|29\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|30\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|31\n!style=\"width:35px;\"|0\n!style=\"width:30px;\"|0\n!style=\"width:35px;\"|4\n!style=\"width:30px;\"|32\n!style=\"width:35px;\"|8\n!style=\"width:30px;\"|64\n!style=\"width:35px;\"|\n!style=\"width:30px;\"|\nEncapsulating Security Payload.\nThe IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) was developed at the Naval Research Laboratory starting in 1992 as part of a DARPA-sponsored research project, and was openly published by IETF SIPP Working Group drafted in December 1993 as a security extension for SIPP. This ESP was originally derived from the US Department of Defense SP3D protocol, rather than being derived from the ISO Network-Layer Security Protocol (NLSP). The SP3D protocol specification was published by NIST in the late 1980s, but designed by the Secure Data Network System project of the US Department of Defense. \nEncapsulating Security Payload (ESP) is a member of the IPsec protocol suite. It provides origin authenticity through source authentication, data integrity through hash functions and confidentiality through encryption protection for IP packets. ESP also supports encryption-only and authentication-only configurations, but using encryption without authentication is strongly discouraged because it is insecure.\nUnlike Authentication Header (AH), ESP in transport mode does not provide integrity and authentication for the entire IP packet. However, in tunnel mode, where the entire original IP packet is encapsulated with a new packet header added, ESP protection is afforded to the whole inner IP packet (including the inner header) while the outer header (including any outer IPv4 options or IPv6 extension headers) remains unprotected.\nESP operates directly on top of IP, using IP protocol number 50.\nThe following ESP packet diagram shows how an ESP packet is constructed and interpreted:\n!style=\"min-width:42px; border-bottom:none; border-right:none;\"|\"Offset\"\n!style=\"border-left:none;\"|Octet\n!colspan=\"8\"|0\n!colspan=\"8\"|1\n!colspan=\"8\"|2\n!colspan=\"8\"|3\n!style=\"min-width: 42px;border-top: none;\"|Octet\n!style=\"min-width: 42px;\"|Bit\n!style=\"min-width:11px;\"|0\n!style=\"min-width:11px;\"|1\n!style=\"min-width:11px;\"|2\n!style=\"min-width:11px;\"|3\n!style=\"min-width:11px;\"|4\n!style=\"min-width:11px;\"|5\n!style=\"min-width:11px;\"|6\n!style=\"min-width:11px;\"|7\n!style=\"min-width:11px;\"|8\n!style=\"min-width:11px;\"|9\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|10\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|11\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|12\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|13\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|14\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|15\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|16\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|17\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|18\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|19\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|20\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|21\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|22\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|23\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|24\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|25\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|26\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|27\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|28\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|29\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|30\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|31\n!style=\"width:35px;\"|0\n!style=\"width:30px;\"|0\n!style=\"width:35px;\"|4\n!style=\"width:30px;\"|32\n!style=\"width:35px;\"|\n!style=\"width:30px;\"|\n!style=\"width:35px;\"|&amp;vellip;\n!style=\"width:30px;\"|&amp;vellip;\n!style=\"width:35px;\"|&amp;vellip;\n!style=\"width:30px;\"|&amp;vellip;\n!style=\"width:35px;\"|&amp;vellip;\n!style=\"width:30px;\"|&amp;vellip;\n!style=\"width:35px;\"|&amp;vellip;\n!style=\"width:30px;\"|&amp;vellip;\nSecurity association.\nThe IPsec protocols use a security association, where the communicating parties establish shared security attributes such as algorithms and keys. As such, IPsec provides a range of options once it has been determined whether AH or ESP is used. Before exchanging data, the two hosts agree on which symmetric encryption algorithm is used to encrypt the IP packet, for example AES or ChaCha20, and which hash function is used to ensure the integrity of the data, such as BLAKE2 or SHA256. These parameters are agreed for the particular session, for which a lifetime must be agreed and a session key.\nThe algorithm for authentication is also agreed before the data transfer takes place and IPsec supports a range of methods. Authentication is possible through pre-shared key, where a symmetric key is already in the possession of both hosts, and the hosts send each other hashes of the shared key to prove that they are in possession of the same key. IPsec also supports public key encryption, where each host has a public and a private key, they exchange their public keys and each host sends the other a nonce encrypted with the other host's public key. Alternatively if both hosts hold a public key certificate from a certificate authority, this can be used for IPsec authentication.\nThe security associations of IPsec are established using the Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP). ISAKMP is implemented by manual configuration with pre-shared secrets, Internet Key Exchange (IKE and IKEv2), Kerberized Internet Negotiation of Keys (KINK), and the use of IPSECKEY DNS records. RFC 5386 defines Better-Than-Nothing Security (BTNS) as an unauthenticated mode of IPsec using an extended IKE protocol. C. Meadows, C. Cremers, and others have used formal methods to identify various anomalies which exist in IKEv1 and also in IKEv2.\nIn order to decide what protection is to be provided for an outgoing packet, IPsec uses the Security Parameter Index (SPI), an index to the security association database (SADB), along with the destination address in a packet header, which together uniquely identifies a security association for that packet. A similar procedure is performed for an incoming packet, where IPsec gathers decryption and verification keys from the security association database.\nFor IP multicast a security association is provided for the group, and is duplicated across all authorized receivers of the group. There may be more than one security association for a group, using different SPIs, thereby allowing multiple levels and sets of security within a group. Indeed, each sender can have multiple security associations, allowing authentication, since a receiver can only know that someone knowing the keys sent the data. Note that the relevant standard does not describe how the association is chosen and duplicated across the group; it is assumed that a responsible party will have made the choice.\nKeepalives.\nTo ensure that the connection between two endpoints has not been interrupted, endpoints exchange keepalive messages at regular intervals, which can also be used to automatically reestablish a tunnel lost due to connection interruption.\nDead Peer Detection (DPD) is a method of detecting a dead Internet Key Exchange (IKE) peer. The method uses IPsec traffic patterns to minimize the number of messages required to confirm the availability of a peer. DPD is used to reclaim the lost resources in case a peer is found dead and it is also used to perform IKE peer failover.\nUDP keepalive is an alternative to DPD.\nModes of operation.\nThe IPsec protocols AH and ESP can be implemented in a host-to-host transport mode, as well as in a network tunneling mode.\nTransport mode.\nIn transport mode, only the payload of the IP packet is usually encrypted or authenticated. The routing is intact, since the IP header is neither modified nor encrypted; however, when the authentication header is used, the IP addresses cannot be modified by network address translation, as this always invalidates the hash value. The transport and application layers are always secured by a hash, so they cannot be modified in any way, for example by translating the port numbers.\nA means to encapsulate IPsec messages for NAT traversal (NAT-T) has been defined by RFC documents describing the NAT-T mechanism.\nTunnel mode.\nIn tunnel mode, the entire IP packet is encrypted and authenticated. It is then encapsulated into a new IP packet with a new IP header. Tunnel mode is used to create virtual private networks for network-to-network communications (e.g. between routers to link sites), host-to-network communications (e.g. remote user access) and host-to-host communications (e.g. private chat).\nTunnel mode supports NAT traversal.\nAlgorithms.\nSymmetric encryption algorithms.\nCryptographic algorithms defined for use with IPsec include:\nRefer to RFC 8221 for details.\nImplementations.\nThe IPsec can be implemented in the IP stack of an operating system. This method of implementation is done for hosts and security gateways. Various IPsec capable IP stacks are available from companies, such as HP or IBM. An alternative is so called bump-in-the-stack (BITS) implementation, where the operating system source code does not have to be modified. Here IPsec is installed between the IP stack and the network drivers. This way operating systems can be retrofitted with IPsec. This method of implementation is also used for both hosts and gateways. However, when retrofitting IPsec the encapsulation of IP packets may cause problems for the automatic path MTU discovery, where the maximum transmission unit (MTU) size on the network path between two IP hosts is established. If a host or gateway has a separate cryptoprocessor, which is common in the military and can also be found in commercial systems, a so-called bump-in-the-wire (BITW) implementation of IPsec is possible.\nWhen IPsec is implemented in the kernel, the key management and ISAKMP/IKE negotiation is carried out from user space. The NRL-developed and openly specified \"PF_KEY Key Management API, Version 2\" is often used to enable the application-space key management application to update the IPsec security associations stored within the kernel-space IPsec implementation. Existing IPsec implementations usually include ESP, AH, and IKE version 2. Existing IPsec implementations on Unix-like operating systems, for example, Solaris or Linux, usually include PF_KEY version 2.\nEmbedded IPsec can be used to ensure the secure communication among applications running over constrained resource systems with a small overhead.\nStandards status.\nIPsec was developed in conjunction with IPv6 and was originally required to be supported by all standards-compliant implementations of IPv6 before RFC 6434 made it only a recommendation. IPsec is also optional for IPv4 implementations. IPsec is most commonly used to secure IPv4 traffic.\nIPsec protocols were originally defined in RFC 1825 through RFC 1829, which were published in 1995. In 1998, these documents were superseded by RFC 2401 and RFC 2412 with a few incompatible engineering details, although they were conceptually identical. In addition, a mutual authentication and key exchange protocol Internet Key Exchange (IKE) was defined to create and manage security associations. In December 2005, new standards were defined in RFC 4301 and RFC 4309 which are largely a superset of the previous editions with a second version of the Internet Key Exchange standard IKEv2. These third-generation documents standardized the abbreviation of IPsec to uppercase \"IP\" and lowercase \"sec\". \"ESP\" generally refers to RFC 4303, which is the most recent version of the specification.\nSince mid-2008, an IPsec Maintenance and Extensions (ipsecme) working group is active at the IETF.\nAlleged NSA interference.\nIn 2013, as part of the Snowden leaks, it was revealed that the US National Security Agency had been actively working to \"Insert vulnerabilities into commercial encryption systems, IT systems, networks, and endpoint communications devices used by targets\" as part of the Bullrun program. There are allegations that IPsec was a targeted encryption system.\nThe OpenBSD IPsec stack came later on and also was widely copied. In a letter which OpenBSD lead developer Theo de Raadt received on 11 Dec 2010 from Gregory Perry, it is alleged that Jason Wright and others, working for the FBI, inserted \"a number of backdoors and side channel key leaking mechanisms\" into the OpenBSD crypto code. In the forwarded email from 2010, Theo de Raadt did not at first express an official position on the validity of the claims, apart from the implicit endorsement from forwarding the email. Jason Wright's response to the allegations: \"Every urban legend is made more real by the inclusion of real names, dates, and times. Gregory Perry's email falls into this category. ... I will state clearly that I did not add backdoors to the OpenBSD operating system or the OpenBSD Cryptographic Framework (OCF).\" Some days later, de Raadt commented that \"I believe that NETSEC was probably contracted to write backdoors as alleged. ... If those were written, I don't believe they made it into our tree.\" This was published before the Snowden leaks.\nAn alternative explanation put forward by the authors of the Logjam attack suggests that the NSA compromised IPsec VPNs by undermining the Diffie-Hellman algorithm used in the key exchange. In their paper, they allege the NSA specially built a computing cluster to precompute multiplicative subgroups for specific primes and generators, such as for the second Oakley group defined in RFC 2409. As of May 2015, 90% of addressable IPsec VPNs supported the second Oakley group as part of IKE. If an organization were to precompute this group, they could derive the keys being exchanged and decrypt traffic without inserting any software backdoors.\nA second alternative explanation that was put forward was that the Equation Group used zero-day exploits against several manufacturers' VPN equipment which were validated by Kaspersky Lab as being tied to the Equation Group and validated by those manufacturers as being real exploits, some of which were zero-day exploits at the time of their exposure. The Cisco PIX and ASA firewalls had vulnerabilities that were used for wiretapping by the NSA.\nFurthermore, IPsec VPNs using \"Aggressive Mode\" settings send a hash of the PSK in the clear. This can be and apparently is targeted by the NSA using offline dictionary attacks.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The town is a former silver mining camp on the San Miguel River in the western San Juan Mountains. The first gold mining claim was made in the mountains above Telluride in 1875, and early settlement of what is now Telluride followed. The town was founded in 1878.\nTelluride sits in a box canyon. Steep forested mountains and cliffs surround it, with Bridal Veil Falls situated at the canyon's head. Numerous weathered ruins of old mining operations dot the hillsides. A free gondola connects the town with its companion town, Mountain Village, at the base of the ski area. Telluride and the surrounding area have featured prominently in popular culture, and it is the subject of several popular songs. It is especially known for its ski resort and slopes during the winter, as well as an extensive festival schedule during the summer, including the Hot Air Balloon Festival, which traditionally occurs the first weekend in June.\nThe Telluride Historic District, which includes a significant portion of the town, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is also one of Colorado's 20 National Historic Landmarks. The town population was 2,607 in the 2020 United States census.\nHistory.\nMining days.\nGold was first discovered in Colorado near present-day Denver, setting off the Pike's Peak gold rush of 1858. The Smuggler gold vein above Telluride, and placer gold in the San Miguel River, were discovered in 1875. John Fallon made the first claim in Marshal Basin above Telluride in 1875 and settlement followed. The town of Columbia was founded in 1878. The Telluride, Colorado, post office opened at Columbia on July 26, 1880, since the United States Post Office Department would not approve the name Columbia. Columbia (Telluride since 1887) has been the seat of San Miguel County, Colorado, since the county was created on March 2, 1883. The Town of Columbia was incorporated on February 10, 1887, but the town changed its name to the Town of Telluride a few months later. The town was named after valuable ore compounds of the chemical element tellurium, a metalloid element which forms natural tellurides, the most notable of which are telluride ores of gold and silver. Although gold telluride minerals were never actually found in the mountains near Telluride, the area's mines were rich in zinc, lead, copper, silver, and ores which contained gold in other forms.\nTelluride began slowly because of its isolated location. In 1881, a toll road was opened by Otto Mears, which allowed wagons to go where only pack mules could go before. This increased the number of people in Telluride, but it was still expensive to get gold-rich ore out of the valley.\nIn June 1889, Butch Cassidy, before becoming associated with his gang, the \"Wild Bunch\", robbed the San Miguel Valley Bank in Telluride. This was his first major recorded crime. He exited the bank with $24,580 (equal to $ today) and later became famous as a bank robber.\nIn 1891, the Rio Grande Southern Railroad, also begun by Mears, arrived in Telluride, eventually building a two-stall engine house, water facilities, a section house and a bunkhouse, sidings, and a depot. It continued further up the valley to end its Telluride branch at Pandora, serving the mines and the town until 1952. The cheaper and consistent transportation for passengers and freight allowed miners and goods to flow into the San Miguel town and ore to flow out to the mills and foundries elsewhere. This brought a brief but unprecedented boom to Telluride before the Panic of 1893.\nAround the turn of the 20th century, there were serious labor disputes in the mines near Telluride. The Colorado National Guard was called out and there were deaths on both sides. Unions were formed as miners joined the Western Federation of Miners in 1896. 1899 brought big changes as union strike action led most mines to grant miners $3 a day for an 8-hour day's work plus a boarding pay of $1 a day (equal to $ today). At this time, workers were putting in 10- to 12-hour days and the mines ran 24 hours a day. Work conditions were treacherous, with mines above , a lack of safety measures, and bitter weather in winter months. Even the boarding houses were precariously placed on the mountainsides.\nTelluride's labor unrest occurred against the backdrop of a statewide struggle between miners and mine owners. Bulkeley Wells was one mine operator considerably hostile to the union. The Telluride Miners' Union was led by Vincent St. John. The disappearance of mine guard William J. Barney, which Wells declared a \"murder\", created much intrigue and national interest. The accusations, animosity, gunplay, and expulsions that followed were part of an ongoing struggle throughout Colorado's mining communities which came to be called the Colorado Labor Wars.\nIn 1891, Telluride's L. L. Nunn joined forces with George Westinghouse to build the Ames Hydroelectric Generating Plant, an alternating current power station, near Telluride. The plant supplied power to the Gold King Mine away. This was the first successful demonstration of long-distance transmission of industrial-grade alternating current power and used two Westinghouse alternators, one working as a generator producing 3,000 volts, 133 Hertz, single-phase AC, and the other used as an AC motor. This hydroelectric AC power plant predated the Westinghouse plant at Niagara Falls by four years. Nunn and his brother Paul built power plants in Colorado, Utah, Idaho, Montana, Mexico, and the Ontario Power plant at Niagara Falls on the Canadian side. Nunn developed a keen interest in education as part of his electrical power companies, and in conjunction with Cornell University built the Telluride House at Cornell in 1909 to educate promising students in electrical engineering. Later, Nunn along with Charles Walcott, started the non-profit Telluride Association. Nunn founded Deep Springs College in 1917. \nTelluride's most famous historic mines are the Tomboy, Pandora, Smuggler-Union, Nellie, and Sheridan mines. Beginning in 1939, the hard-rock mining operations in the Red Mountain and Telluride mining districts began a lengthy consolidation under the Idarado Mining Company (Idarado), now a division of Newmont Mining. The consolidation ended in 1953 with Idarado's acquisition of the Telluride Mines. Idarado kept the underground workings and mill operations open at Telluride's Pandora hard-rock mine until 1978. When the mine officially closed, the snow which tormented Telluride's miners became the town's new source of income, in the form of skiing and tourism. The documentary video \"the YX factor\" chronicles the transition from mining to skiing and the influx of \"hippies\" in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the words of local residents and commentators such as Peter Yarrow and Tom Hayden.\nSkiing era.\nMining was Telluride's only industry until 1972 when the first ski lift was installed by Telluride Ski Resort founder Joseph T. Zoline and his Telluride Ski Corporation (Telco). Zoline bought the land for the future resort in 1969 and began to craft the slopes. Along with his mountain manager, Telluride native Bill \"Sr.\" Mahoney, they slowly and thoughtfully put together a plan for the sustained development of Telluride and the region. As mining phased out and a new service industry phased in, the local population changed sharply. Mining families fled Telluride to settle in places like Moab, Utah, where uranium mining offered hope of continued employment. Mining families were replaced by what locals referred to as \"hippies\", young people with a 1960s worldview that often clashed with the values of Telluride's old-timers. These newcomers were characterized as idle \"trust funders\" drawn to the town for a casual lifestyle and outdoor excitements such as hang gliding, mountain climbing, and kayaking.\nThe new population opposed town growth and economic expansion, including growth due to tourism and skiing. At one point, a serious effort was made to ban cars from the city limits and force visitors to use horse-drawn carts. The 1970s had fluctuating snowfalls and economic recession, but the town's music and film festivals flourished. They exposed hundreds of thousands to the grandeur of the valley for the first time and created iconic associations with elite entertainers. Meanwhile, ski area founder Joe Zoline worked to develop one of the best mountains in North America for expert skiers, and created the infrastructure for tourism that respected Telluride's need to stay small.\nAs the final ore carts were rolling out of the Pandora mine, tourists began to discover Telluride's views, skiing, and autumn color changes. After the brutal snow drought of 1976 nearly wiped out the embryonic ski and lodging industry, the town started to rebound economically. In 1978, Ron Allred and his partner Jim Wells bought a stake in the ski area to form the Telluride Company. They expanded the infrastructure by adding a gondola connecting Telluride with the Mountain Village.\nDuring the 1980s, Telluride developed a reputation as \"Colorado's best-kept secret\", which paradoxically made it one of the better-known resort communities. Wealthy skiers flocked to the mountain all winter, and sightseers kept hotel rooms full all summer. Telluride also became notorious in the drug counterculture as a drop point for Mexican smugglers and a favorite place for wealthy importers to enjoy downtime. The town was even featured in the hit song by Glenn Frey from \"Miami Vice\", \"Smugglers Blues\". Telluride was living up to its Wild West history. This type of attention helped differentiate it from Aspen. The festivals and Telluride's bad-boy image attracted celebrities like Tom Cruise, Oprah Winfrey, and Oliver Stone. By the mid-1990s, Telluride had shed both its mining personality and drug image to establish itself as a premier resort town balancing modern culture with fascinating western history. In 2003, Prospect Bowl, an extension to the ski area opened, providing the resort with many new trails and runs. Most lifts in the area are high-speed quad chairs capable of holding four passengers. The highest lift on the mountain reaches .\nGeography.\nTelluride has an elevation of in an isolated spot in Southwest Colorado. From the west, Colorado Route 145 is the most common way into Telluride; two other passes enter the town, Imogene Pass and Black Bear Pass.\nOn the eastern side of town, there are two waterfalls: Ingram Falls, which is visible from town, and Bridal Veil Falls and the Bridal Veil Hydroelectric plant, which are just out of sight from town to the right of Ingram. The power plant house was leased for some time by Eric Jacobson, who restored the house and the generator inside. The hydroelectric plant was built in 1895 to power the Smuggler-Union Mine.\nThe town is served by air transportation via Telluride Regional Airport (TEX), once the highest elevation commercial airport in the United States at . The airport is considered challenging by pilots because of frequent adverse weather conditions, high elevation, and the extremely rugged mountain terrain surrounding the airport on nearly all sides. Major airline service is provided seasonally into Montrose (MTJ), approximately north by road.\nClimate.\nTelluride has a humid continental climate (Dfb). The coldest month is January, averaging , and the hottest July, which averages . Precipitation peaks as snow in winter and as thunderstorms in summer with a dry period in late spring. Telluride gets moderate precipitation all year due to its altitude, averaging of water equivalent precipitation, including inches of snow, each year.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 2,221 people, 1,013 households, and 357 families residing in the town. The population density was . There were 1,938 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the town was 92.57% White, 0.81% Native American, 0.72% Asian, 0.41% African American, 4.14% from other races, and 1.35% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 7.20% of the population.\nThere were 1,013 households, out of which 19.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 25.2% were married couples living together, 6.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 64.7% were non-families. 31.9% of all households were made up of individuals, and 1.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

Males had a median income of $35,329 versus $30,096 for females. The per capita income for the town was $38,832. About 8.5% of families and 11.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 16.2% of those under age 18 and 6.9% of those aged 65 or over.\nTransportation.\nTelluride is served by Telluride Regional Airport. Scheduled flight options are limited, due to the airport's somewhat short runway and frequent closures under bad weather, so most passengers going to Telluride use Montrose Regional Airport, to the north.\nFree public transportation is provided in Telluride. The bus system, called \"Galloping Goose\", makes a complete loop around the town. A gondola lift links Telluride with Mountain Village.\nTelluride's free gondola is the only one of its kind in North America. It stops at four stations: Telluride, St. Sophia, and two stops in Mountain Village. It was the first leg of a transportation agreement for the Telluride Region that was stipulated as part of the Mountain Village zoning expansion that would provide free gondola service from the Town of Telluride and the Mountain Village to the Aldasoro Development, the West Meadows Development, the Valley Floor Development, and the West Meadows Development to virtually eliminate the use or need for a car in the Telluride Region of San Miguel County. It is a 13-minute ride and reaches an elevation of at the San Sophia station.\nRegional bus service is provided by the San Miguel Authority for Regional Transportation (SMART).\nTelluride is part of Colorado's Bustang intercity bus service network.

Its artists produced woodblock prints and paintings of such subjects as female beauties; kabuki actors and sumo wrestlers; scenes from history and folk tales; travel scenes and landscapes; flora and fauna; and erotica. The term translates as \"picture[s] of the floating world\".\nIn 1603, the city of Edo (Tokyo) became the seat of the ruling Tokugawa shogunate. The class (merchants, craftsmen and workers), positioned at the bottom of the social order, benefited the most from the city's rapid economic growth. They began to indulge in and patronize the entertainment of kabuki theatre, geisha, and courtesans of the pleasure districts. The term ('floating world') came to describe this hedonistic lifestyle. Printed or painted ukiyo-e works were popular with the class, who had become wealthy enough to afford to decorate their homes with them.\nThe earliest ukiyo-e works emerged in the 1670s, with Hishikawa Moronobu's paintings and monochromatic prints of beautiful women. Colour prints were introduced gradually, and at first were only used for special commissions. By the 1740s, artists such as Okumura Masanobu used multiple woodblocks to print areas of colour. In the 1760s, the success of Suzuki Harunobu's \"brocade prints\" led to full-colour production becoming standard, with ten or more blocks used to create each print. Some ukiyo-e artists specialized in making paintings, but most works were prints. Artists rarely carved their own woodblocks for printing; rather, production was divided between the artist, who designed the prints; the carver, who cut the woodblocks; the printer, who inked and pressed the woodblocks onto handmade paper; and the publisher, who financed, promoted, and distributed the works. As printing was done by hand, printers were able to achieve effects impractical with machines, such as the blending or gradation of colours on the printing block.\nSpecialists have prized the portraits of beauties and actors by masters such as Torii Kiyonaga, Utamaro, and Sharaku that were created in the late 18th century. The 19th century also saw the continuation of masters of the ukiyo-e tradition, with the creation of Hokusai's \"The Great Wave off Kanagawa\", one of the most well-known works of Japanese art, and Hiroshige's \"The Fifty-three Stations of the T\u014dkaid\u014d\". Following the deaths of these two masters, and against the technological and social modernization that followed the Meiji Restoration of 1868, ukiyo-e production went into steep decline.\nHowever, in the 20th century there was a revival in Japanese printmaking: the ('new prints') genre capitalized on Western interest in prints of traditional Japanese scenes, and the ('creative prints') movement promoted individualist works designed, carved, and printed by a single artist. Prints since the late 20th century have continued in an individualist vein, often made with techniques imported from the West.\nUkiyo-e was central to forming the West's perception of Japanese art in the late 19th century, particularly the landscapes of Hokusai and Hiroshige. From the 1870s onward, Japonisme became a prominent trend and had a strong influence on the early French Impressionists such as Edgar Degas, \u00c9douard Manet and Claude Monet, as well as influencing Post-Impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh, and Art Nouveau artists such as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nJapanese art since the Heian period (794\u20131185) had followed two principal paths: the nativist tradition, focusing on Japanese themes, best known by the works of the Tosa school; and Chinese-inspired in a variety of styles, such as the monochromatic ink wash paintings of Sessh\u016b T\u014dy\u014d and his disciples. The Kan\u014d school of painting incorporated features of both.\nSince antiquity, Japanese art had found patrons in the aristocracy, military governments, and religious authorities. Until the 16th century, the lives of the common people had not been a main subject of painting, and even when they were included, the works were luxury items made for the ruling samurai and rich merchant classes. Later works appeared by and for townspeople, including inexpensive monochromatic paintings of female beauties and scenes of the theatre and pleasure districts. The hand-produced nature of these limited the scale of their production, a limit that was soon overcome by genres that turned to mass-produced woodblock printing.\nDuring a prolonged period of civil war in the 16th century, a class of politically powerful merchants developed. These Machish\u016b, the predecessors of the Edo period's , allied themselves with the court and had power over local communities; their patronage of the arts encouraged a revival in the classical arts in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. In the early 17th century, Tokugawa Ieyasu (1543\u20131616) unified the country and was appointed sh\u014dgun with supreme power over Japan. He consolidated his government in the village of Edo (modern Tokyo), and required the territorial lords to assemble there in alternate years with their entourages. The demands of the growing capital drew many male labourers from the country, so that males came to make up nearly seventy percent of the population. The village grew during the Edo period (1603\u20131867) from a population of 1800 to over a million in the 19th century.\nThe centralized shogunate put an end to the power of the and divided the population into four social classes, with the ruling samurai class at the top and the merchant class at the bottom. While deprived of their political influence, those of the merchant class most benefited from the rapidly expanding economy of the Edo period, and their improved lot allowed for leisure that many sought in the pleasure districts\u2014in particular Yoshiwara in Edo\u2014and collecting artworks to decorate their homes, which in earlier times had been well beyond their financial means. The experience of the pleasure quarters was open to those of sufficient wealth, manners, and education.\nWoodblock printing in Japan traces back to the in 770\u00a0CE. Until the 17th century, such printing was reserved for Buddhist seals and images. Movable type appeared around 1600, but as the Japanese writing system required about 100,000 type pieces, hand-carving text onto woodblocks was more efficient. In Saga, Kyoto, calligrapher Hon'ami K\u014detsu and publisher Suminokura Soan combined printed text and images in an adaptation of \"The Tales of Ise\" (1608) and other works of literature. During the Kan'ei era (1624\u20131643) illustrated books of folk tales called ('orange-green books') were the first books mass-produced using woodblock printing. Woodblock imagery continued to evolve as illustrations to the genre of tales of hedonistic urban life in the new capital. The rebuilding of Edo following the Great Fire of Meireki in 1657 occasioned a modernization of the city, and the publication of illustrated printed books flourished in the rapidly urbanizing environment.\nThe term , which can be translated as 'floating world', was homophonous with the ancient Buddhist term , meaning 'this world of sorrow and grief'. The newer term at times was used to mean 'erotic' or 'stylish', among other meanings, and came to describe the hedonistic spirit of the time for the lower classes. Asai Ry\u014di celebrated this spirit in the novel (\"Tales of the Floating World\", c.\u20091661):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[L]iving only for the moment, savouring the moon, the snow, the cherry blossoms, and the maple leaves, singing songs, drinking sake, and diverting oneself just in floating, unconcerned by the prospect of imminent poverty, buoyant and carefree, like a gourd carried along with the river current: this is what we call .\nEmergence of ukiyo-e (late 17th\u00a0\u2013 early 18th centuries).\nThe earliest ukiyo-e artists came from the world of Japanese painting. painting of the 17th century had developed a style of outlined forms which allowed inks to be dripped on a wet surface and spread out towards the outlines\u2014this outlining of forms was to become the dominant style of ukiyo-e.\nAround 1661, painted hanging scrolls known as \"Portraits of Kanbun Beauties\" gained popularity. The paintings of the Kanbun era (1661\u20131673), most of which are anonymous, marked the beginnings of ukiyo-e as an independent school. The paintings of Iwasa Matabei (1578\u20131650) have a great affinity with ukiyo-e paintings. Scholars disagree whether Matabei's work itself is ukiyo-e; assertions that he was the genre's founder are especially common amongst Japanese researchers. At times Matabei has been credited as the artist of the unsigned Hikone screen, a folding screen that may be one of the earliest surviving ukiyo-e works. The screen is in a refined Kan\u014d style and depicts contemporary life, rather than the prescribed subjects of the painterly schools.\nIn response to the increasing demand for ukiyo-e works, Hishikawa Moronobu (1618\u20131694) produced the first ukiyo-e woodblock prints. By 1672, Moronobu's success was such that he began to sign his work\u2014the first of the book illustrators to do so. He was a prolific illustrator who worked in a wide variety of genres, and developed an influential style of portraying female beauties. Most significantly, he began to produce illustrations, not just for books, but as single-sheet images, which could stand alone or be used as part of a series. The Hishikawa school attracted a large number of followers, as well as imitators such as Sugimura Jihei, and signalled the beginning of the popularization of a new artform.\nTorii Kiyonobu\u00a0I and Kaigetsud\u014d Ando became prominent emulators of Moronobu's style following the master's death, though neither was a member of the Hishikawa school. Both discarded background detail in favour of focus on the human figure\u2014kabuki actors in the of Kiyonobu and the Torii school that followed him, and courtesans in the of Ando and his Kaigetsud\u014d school. Ando and his followers produced a stereotyped female image whose design and pose lent itself to effective mass production, and its popularity created a demand for paintings that other artists and schools took advantage of. The Kaigetsud\u014d school and its popular \"Kaigetsud\u014d beauty\" ended after Ando's exile over his role in the Ejima-Ikushima scandal of 1714.\nKyoto native Nishikawa Sukenobu (1671\u20131750) painted technically refined pictures of courtesans. Considered a master of erotic portraits, he was the subject of a government ban in 1722, though it is believed he continued to create works that circulated under different names. Sukenobu spent most of his career in Edo, and his influence was considerable in both the Kant\u014d and Kansai regions. The paintings of Miyagawa Ch\u014dshun (1683\u20131752) portrayed early 18th-century life in delicate colours. Ch\u014dshun made no prints. The Miyagawa school he founded in the early-18th century specialized in romantic paintings in a style more refined in line and colour than the Kaigetsud\u014d school. Ch\u014dshun allowed greater expressive freedom in his adherents, a group that later included Hokusai.\nColour prints (mid-18th century).\nEven in the earliest monochromatic prints and books, colour was added by hand for special commissions. Demand for colour in the early-18th century was met with prints hand-tinted with orange and sometimes green or yellow. These were followed in the 1720s with a vogue for pink-tinted and later the lacquer-like ink of the . In 1744, the were the first successes in colour printing, using multiple woodblocks\u2014one for each colour, the earliest pink and vegetable green.\nA great self-promoter, Okumura Masanobu (1686\u20131764) played a major role during the period of rapid technical development in printing from the late 17th to mid-18th centuries. He established a shop in 1707 and combined elements of the leading contemporary schools in a wide array of genres, though Masanobu himself belonged to no school. Amongst the innovations in his romantic, lyrical images were the introduction of geometrical perspective in the genre in the 1740s; the long, narrow prints; and the combination of graphics and literature in prints that included self-penned haiku poetry.\nUkiyo-e reached a peak in the late 18th century with the advent of full-colour prints, developed after Edo returned to prosperity under Tanuma Okitsugu following a long depression. These popular colour prints came to be called , or 'brocade pictures', as their brilliant colours seemed to bear resemblance to imported Chinese Shuchiang brocades, known in Japanese as . The first to emerge were expensive calendar prints, printed with multiple blocks on very fine (or finer than standard) paper with heavy, opaque inks. These prints had the number of days for each month hidden in the design, and were sent at the New Year as personalized greetings, bearing the name of the patron rather than the artist. The blocks for these prints were later re-used for commercial production, obliterating the patron's name and replacing it with that of the artist.\nThe delicate, romantic prints of Suzuki Harunobu (1725\u20131770) were amongst the first to realize expressive and complex colour designs, printed with up to a dozen separate blocks to handle the different colours and half-tones. His restrained, graceful prints invoked the classicism of poetry and painting. The prolific Harunobu was the dominant ukiyo-e artist of his time. The success of Harunobu's colourful from 1765 on led to a steep decline in demand for the limited palettes of and , as well as hand-coloured prints.\nA trend against the idealism of the prints of Harunobu and the Torii school grew following Harunobu's death in 1770. Katsukawa Shunsh\u014d (1726\u20131793) and his school produced portraits of kabuki actors with greater fidelity to the actors' actual features than had been the trend. Sometime-collaborators Kory\u016bsai (1735\u00a0\u2013 c.\u20091790) and Kitao Shigemasa (1739\u20131820) were prominent depicters of women who also moved ukiyo-e away from the dominance of Harunobu's idealism by focusing on contemporary urban fashions and celebrated real-world courtesans and geisha. Kory\u016bsai was perhaps the most prolific ukiyo-e artist of the 18th century, and produced a larger number of paintings and print series than any predecessor. The Kitao school that Shigemasa founded was one of the dominant schools of the closing decades of the 18th century.\nIn the 1770s, Utagawa Toyoharu produced a number of perspective prints that demonstrated a mastery of Western perspective techniques that had eluded his predecessors in the genre. Toyoharu's works helped pioneer the landscape as an ukiyo-e subject, rather than merely a background for human figures. In the 19th century, Western-style perspective techniques were absorbed into Japanese artistic culture, and deployed in the refined landscapes of such artists as Hokusai and Hiroshige, the latter a member of the Utagawa school that Toyoharu founded. This school was to become one of the most influential, and produced works in a far greater variety of genres than any other school.\nPeak period (late 18th century).\nWhile the late 18th century saw hard economic times, ukiyo-e saw a peak in quantity and quality of works, particularly during the Kansei era (1789\u20131791). The ukiyo-e of the period of the Kansei Reforms brought about a focus on beauty and harmony that collapsed into decadence and disharmony in the next century as the reforms broke down and tensions rose, culminating in the Meiji Restoration of 1868.\nEspecially in the 1780s, Torii Kiyonaga (1752\u20131815) of the Torii school depicted traditional ukiyo-e subjects like beauties and urban scenes, which he printed on large sheets of paper, often as multiprint horizontal diptychs or triptychs. His works dispensed with the poetic dreamscapes made by Harunobu, opting instead for realistic depictions of idealized female forms dressed in the latest fashions and posed in scenic locations. He also produced portraits of kabuki actors in a realistic style that included accompanying musicians and chorus.\nA law went into effect in 1790 requiring prints to bear a censor's seal of approval to be sold. Censorship increased in strictness over the following decades, and violators could receive harsh punishments. From 1799 even preliminary drafts required approval. A group of Utagawa-school offenders including Toyokuni had their works repressed in 1801, and Utamaro was imprisoned in 1804 for making prints of 16th-century political and military leader Toyotomi Hideyoshi.\nUtamaro (c.\u20091753\u20131806) made his name in the 1790s with his ('large-headed pictures of beautiful women') portraits, focusing on the head and upper torso, a style others had previously employed in portraits of kabuki actors. Utamaro experimented with line, colour, and printing techniques to bring out subtle differences in the features, expressions, and backdrops of subjects from a wide variety of class and background. Utamaro's individuated beauties were in sharp contrast to the stereotyped, idealized images that had been the norm. By the end of the decade, especially following the death of his patron Tsutaya J\u016bzabur\u014d in 1797, Utamaro's prodigious output declined in quality, and he died in 1806.\nAppearing suddenly in 1794 and disappearing just as suddenly ten months later, the prints of the enigmatic Sharaku are amongst ukiyo-e's best known. Sharaku produced striking portraits of kabuki actors, introducing a greater level of realism into his prints that emphasized the differences between the actor and the portrayed character. The expressive, contorted faces he depicted contrasted sharply with the serene, mask-like faces more common to artists such as Harunobu or Utamaro. Published by Tsutaya, Sharaku's work found resistance, and in 1795 his output ceased as mysteriously as it had appeared; his real identity is still unknown. Utagawa Toyokuni (1769\u20131825) produced kabuki portraits in a style Edo townsfolk found more accessible, emphasizing dramatic postures and avoiding Sharaku's realism.\nA consistent high level of quality marks ukiyo-e of the late 18th-century, but the works of Utamaro and Sharaku often overshadow those other masters of the era. One of Kiyonaga's followers, Eishi (1756\u20131829), abandoned his position as painter for sh\u014dgun Tokugawa Ieharu to take up ukiyo-e design. He brought a refined sense to his portraits of graceful, slender courtesans, and left behind a number of noted students. With a fine line, Eish\u014dsai Ch\u014dki (fl. 1786\u20131808) designed portraits of delicate courtesans. The Utagawa school came to dominate ukiyo-e output in the late Edo period.\nEdo was the primary centre of ukiyo-e production throughout the Edo period. Another major centre developed in the Kamigata region of areas in and around Kyoto and Osaka. In contrast to the range of subjects in the Edo prints, those of Kamigata tended to be portraits of kabuki actors. The style of the Kamigata prints was little distinguished from those of Edo until the late 18th century, partly because artists often moved back and forth between the two areas. Colours tend to be softer and pigments thicker in Kamigata prints than in those of Edo. In the 19th century, many of the prints were designed by kabuki fans and other amateurs.\nLate flowering: flora, fauna, and landscapes (19th century).\nThe Tenp\u014d Reforms of 1841\u20131843 sought to suppress outward displays of luxury, including the depiction of courtesans and actors. As a result, many ukiyo-e artists designed travel scenes and pictures of nature, especially birds and flowers. Landscapes had been given limited attention since Moronobu, and they formed an important element in the works of Kiyonaga and Shunch\u014d. It was not until late in the Edo period that landscape came into its own as a genre, especially via the works of Hokusai and Hiroshige The landscape genre has come to dominate Western perceptions of ukiyo-e, though ukiyo-e had a long history preceding these late-era masters. The Japanese landscape differed from the Western tradition in that it relied more heavily on imagination, composition, and atmosphere than on strict observance of nature.\nThe self-proclaimed \"mad painter\" Hokusai (1760\u20131849) enjoyed a long, varied career. His work is marked by a lack of the sentimentality common to ukiyo-e, and a focus on formalism influenced by Western art. Among his accomplishments are his illustrations of Takizawa Bakin's novel \"Crescent Moon\", his series of sketchbooks, the \"Hokusai Manga\", and his popularization of the landscape genre with \"Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji\", which includes his best-known print, \"The Great Wave off Kanagawa\", one of the most famous works of Japanese art. In contrast to the work of the older masters, Hokusai's colours were bold, flat, and abstract, and his subject was not the pleasure districts but the lives and environment of the common people at work. Established masters Eisen, Kuniyoshi, and Kunisada also followed Hokusai's steps into landscape prints in the 1830s, producing prints with bold compositions and striking effects.\nThough not often given the attention of their better-known forebears, the Utagawa school produced a few masters in this declining period. The prolific Kunisada (1786\u20131865) had few rivals in the tradition of making portrait prints of courtesans and actors. One of those rivals was Eisen (1790\u20131848), who was also adept at landscapes. Perhaps the last significant member of this late period, Kuniyoshi (1797\u20131861) tried his hand at a variety of themes and styles, much as Hokusai had. His historical scenes of warriors in violent combat were popular, especially his series of heroes from the (1827\u20131830) and (1847). He was adept at landscapes and satirical scenes\u2014the latter an area rarely explored in the dictatorial atmosphere of the Edo period; that Kuniyoshia could dare tackle such subjects was a sign of the weakening of the shogunate at the time.\nHiroshige (1797\u20131858) is considered Hokusai's greatest rival in stature. He specialized in pictures of birds and flowers, and serene landscapes, and is best known for his travel series, such as \"The Fifty-three Stations of the T\u014dkaid\u014d\" and \"The Sixty-nine Stations of the Kisokaid\u014d\", the latter a cooperative effort with Eisen. His work was more realistic, subtly coloured, and atmospheric than Hokusai's; nature and the seasons were key elements: mist, rain, snow, and moonlight were prominent parts of his compositions. Hiroshige's followers, including adopted son Hiroshige II and son-in-law Hiroshige III, carried on their master's style of landscapes into the Meiji era.\nDecline (late 19th century).\nFollowing the deaths of Hokusai and Hiroshige and the Meiji Restoration of 1868, ukiyo-e suffered a sharp decline in quantity and quality. The rapid Westernization of the Meiji period that followed saw woodblock printing turn its services to journalism, and face competition from photography. Practitioners of pure ukiyo-e became more rare, and tastes turned away from a genre seen as a remnant of an obsolete era. Artists continued to produce occasional notable works, but by the 1890s the tradition was moribund.\nSynthetic pigments imported from Germany began to replace traditional organic ones in the mid-19th century. Many prints from this era made extensive use of a bright red, and were called ('red pictures'). Artists such as Yoshitoshi (1839\u20131892) led a trend in the 1860s of gruesome scenes of murders and ghosts, monsters and supernatural beings, and legendary Japanese and Chinese heroes. His \"One Hundred Aspects of the Moon\" (1885\u20131892) depicts a variety of fantastic and mundane themes with a moon motif. Kiyochika (1847\u20131915) is known for his prints documenting the rapid modernization of Tokyo, such as the introduction of railways, and his depictions of Japan's wars with China and with Russia. Earlier a painter of the Kan\u014d school, in the 1870s Chikanobu (1838\u20131912) turned to prints, particularly of the imperial family and scenes of Western influence on Japanese life in the Meiji period.\nIntroduction to the West.\nAside from Dutch traders, who had had trading relations dating to the beginning of the Edo period, Westerners paid little notice to Japanese art before the mid-19th century, and when they did they rarely distinguished it from other art from the East. Swedish naturalist Carl Peter Thunberg spent a year in the Dutch trading settlement Dejima, near Nagasaki, and was one of the earliest Westerners to collect Japanese prints. The export of ukiyo-e thereafter slowly grew, and at the beginning of the 19th century Dutch merchant-trader Isaac Titsingh's collection drew the attention of connoisseurs of art in Paris.\nThe arrival in Edo of American Commodore Matthew Perry in 1853 led to the Convention of Kanagawa in 1854, which opened Japan to the outside world after over two centuries of seclusion. Ukiyo-e prints were amongst the items he brought back to the United States. Such prints had appeared in Paris from at least the 1830s, and by the 1850s were numerous; reception was mixed, and even when praised ukiyo-e was generally thought inferior to Western works which emphasized mastery of naturalistic perspective and anatomy. Japanese art drew notice at the International Exhibition of 1867 in Paris, and became fashionable in France and England in the 1870s and 1880s. The prints of Hokusai and Hiroshige played a prominent role in shaping Western perceptions of Japanese art. At the time of their introduction to the West, woodblock printing was the most common mass medium in Japan, and the Japanese considered it of little lasting value.\nEarly Europeans promoters and scholars of ukiyo-e and Japanese art included writer Edmond de Goncourt and art critic Philippe Burty, who coined the term \"Japonism\". Stores selling Japanese goods opened, including those of \u00c9douard Desoye in 1862 and art dealer Siegfried Bing in 1875. From 1888 to 1891 Bing published the magazine \"Artistic Japan\" in English, French, and German editions, and curated an ukiyo-e exhibition at the in 1890 attended by artists such as Mary Cassatt.\nAmerican Ernest Fenollosa was the earliest Western devotee of Japanese culture, and did much to promote Japanese art\u2014Hokusai's works featured prominently at his inaugural exhibition as first curator of Japanese art Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and in Tokyo in 1898 he curated the first ukiyo-e exhibition in Japan. By the end of the 19th century, the popularity of ukiyo-e in the West drove prices beyond the means of most collectors\u2014some, such as Degas, traded their own paintings for such prints. Tadamasa Hayashi was a prominent Paris-based dealer of respected tastes whose Tokyo office was responsible for evaluating and exporting large quantities of ukiyo-e prints to the West in such quantities that Japanese critics later accused him of siphoning Japan of its national treasure. The drain first went unnoticed in Japan, as Japanese artists were immersing themselves in the classical painting techniques of the West.\nJapanese art, and particularly ukiyo-e prints, came to influence Western art from the time of the early Impressionists. Early painter-collectors incorporated Japanese themes and compositional techniques into their works as early as the 1860s: the patterned wallpapers and rugs in Manet's paintings were inspired by the patterned kimono found in ukiyo-e pictures, and Whistler focused his attention on ephemeral elements of nature as in ukiyo-e landscapes. Van\u00a0Gogh was an avid collector, and painted copies in oil of prints by Hiroshige and Eisen. Degas and Cassatt depicted fleeting, everyday moments in Japanese-influenced compositions and perspectives. ukiyo-e's flat perspective and unmodulated colours were a particular influence on graphic designers and poster makers. Toulouse-Lautrec's lithographs displayed his interest not only in ukiyo-e's flat colours and outlined forms, but also in their subject matter: performers and prostitutes. He signed much of this work with his initials in a circle, imitating the seals on Japanese prints. Other artists of the time who drew influence from ukiyo-e include Monet, La Farge, Gauguin, and Les Nabis members such as Bonnard and Vuillard. French composer Claude Debussy drew inspiration for his music from the prints of Hokusai and Hiroshige, most prominently in (1905). Imagist poets such as Amy Lowell and Ezra Pound found inspiration in ukiyo-e prints; Lowell published a book of poetry called \"Pictures of the Floating World\" (1919) on oriental themes or in an oriental style.\nDescendant traditions (20th century).\nThe travel sketchbook became a popular genre beginning about 1905, as the Meiji government promoted travel within Japan to have citizens better know their country. In 1915, publisher Sh\u014dzabur\u014d Watanabe introduced the term (\"new prints\") to describe a style of prints he published that featured traditional Japanese subject matter and were aimed at foreign and upscale Japanese audiences. Prominent artists included Goy\u014d Hashiguchi, called the \"Utamaro of the Taish\u014d period\" for his manner of depicting women; Shinsui It\u014d, who brought more modern sensibilities to images of women; and Hasui Kawase, who made modern landscapes. Watanabe also published works by non-Japanese artists, an early success of which was a set of Indian- and Japanese-themed prints in 1916 by the English Charles W. Bartlett (1860\u20131940). Other publishers followed Watanabe's success, and some artists such as Goy\u014d and Hiroshi Yoshida set up studios to publish their own work.\nArtists of the ('creative prints') movement took control of every aspect of the printmaking process\u2014design, carving, and printing were by the same pair of hands. Kanae Yamamoto (1882\u20131946), then a student at the Tokyo School of Fine Arts, is credited with the birth of this approach. In 1904, he produced \"Fisherman\" using woodblock printing, a technique until then frowned upon by the Japanese art establishment as old-fashioned and for its association with commercial mass production. The foundation of the Japanese Woodcut Artists' Association in 1918 marks the beginning of this approach as a movement. The movement favoured individuality in its artists, and as such has no dominant themes or styles. Works ranged from the entirely abstract ones of K\u014dshir\u014d Onchi (1891\u20131955) to the traditional figurative depictions of Japanese scenes of Un'ichi Hiratsuka (1895\u20131997). These artists produced prints not because they hoped to reach a mass audience, but as a creative end in itself, and did not restrict their print media to the woodblock of traditional ukiyo-e.\nPrints from the late-20th and 21st centuries have evolved from the concerns of earlier movements, especially the movement's emphasis on individual expression. Screen printing, etching, mezzotint, mixed media, and other Western methods have joined traditional woodcutting amongst printmakers' techniques.\nStyle.\nEarly ukiyo-e artists brought with them a sophisticated knowledge of and training in the composition principles of classical Chinese painting; gradually these artists shed the overt Chinese influence to develop a native Japanese idiom. The early ukiyo-e artists have been called \"Primitives\" in the sense that the print medium was a new challenge to which they adapted these centuries-old techniques\u2014their image designs are not considered \"primitive\". Many ukiyo-e artists received training from teachers of the Kan\u014d and other painterly schools.\nA defining feature of most ukiyo-e prints is a well-defined, bold, flat line. The earliest prints were monochromatic, and these lines were the only printed element; even with the advent of colour this characteristic line continued to dominate. In ukiyo-e composition forms are arranged in flat spaces with figures typically in a single plane of depth. Attention was drawn to vertical and horizontal relationships, as well as details such as lines, shapes, and patterns such as those on clothing. Compositions were often asymmetrical, and the viewpoint was often from unusual angles, such as from above. Elements of images were often cropped, giving the composition a spontaneous feel. In colour prints, contours of most colour areas are sharply defined, usually by the linework. The aesthetic of flat areas of colour contrasts with the modulated colours expected in Western traditions and with other prominent contemporary traditions in Japanese art patronized by the upper class, such as in the subtle monochrome ink brushstrokes of zenga brush painting or tonal colours of the Kan\u014d school of painting.\nThe colourful, ostentatious, and complex patterns, concern with changing fashions, and tense, dynamic poses and compositions in ukiyo-e are in striking contrast with many concepts in traditional Japanese aesthetics. Prominent amongst these, favours simplicity, asymmetry, and imperfection, with evidence of the passage of time; and values subtlety, humility, and restraint. Ukiyo-e can be less at odds with aesthetic concepts such as the racy, urbane stylishness of .\nUkiyo-e displays an unusual approach to graphical perspective, one that can appear underdeveloped when compared to European paintings of the same period. Western-style geometrical perspective was known in Japan\u2014practised most prominently by the Akita ranga painters of the 1770s\u2014as were Chinese methods to create a sense of depth using a homogeny of parallel lines. The techniques sometimes appeared together in ukiyo-e works, geometrical perspective providing an illusion of depth in the background and the more expressive Chinese perspective in the fore. The techniques were most likely learned at first through Chinese Western-style paintings rather than directly from Western works. Long after becoming familiar with these techniques, artists continued to harmonize them with traditional methods according to their compositional and expressive needs. Other ways of indicating depth included the Chinese tripartite composition method used in Buddhist pictures, where a large form is placed in the foreground, a smaller in the midground, and yet a smaller in the background; this can be seen in Hokusai's \"Great Wave\", with a large boat in the foreground, a smaller behind it, and a small Mt Fuji behind them.\nThere was a tendency since early ukiyo-e to pose beauties in what art historian Midori Wakakura called a \"serpentine posture\", which involves the subjects' bodies twisting unnaturally while facing behind themselves. Art historian Motoaki K\u014dno posited that this had its roots in traditional dance; Haruo Suwa countered that the poses were artistic licence taken by ukiyo-e artists, causing a seemingly relaxed pose to reach unnatural or impossible physical extremes. This remained the case even when realistic perspective techniques were applied to other sections of the composition.\nThemes and genres.\nTypical subjects were female beauties (\"), kabuki actors (\"), and landscapes. The women depicted were most often courtesans and geisha at leisure, and promoted the entertainments to be found in the pleasure districts. The detail with which artists depicted courtesans' fashions and hairstyles allows the prints to be dated with some reliability. Less attention was given to accuracy of the women's physical features, which followed the day's pictorial fashions\u2014the faces stereotyped, the bodies tall and lanky in one generation and petite in another. Portraits of celebrities were much in demand, in particular those from the kabuki and sumo worlds, two of the most popular entertainments of the era. While the landscape has come to define ukiyo-e for many Westerners, landscapes flourished relatively late in the ukiyo-e's history.\nUkiyo-e prints grew out of book illustration\u2014many of Moronobu's earliest single-page prints were originally pages from books he had illustrated. books of illustrations were popular and continued be an important outlet for ukiyo-e artists. In the late period, Hokusai produced the three-volume \"One Hundred Views of Mount Fuji\" and the 15-volume \"Hokusai Manga\", the latter a compendium of over 4000 sketches of a wide variety of realistic and fantastic subjects.\nTraditional Japanese religions do not consider sex or pornography a moral corruption in the sense of most Abrahamic faiths, and until the changing morals of the Meiji era led to its suppression, shunga erotic prints were a major genre. While the Tokugawa regime subjected Japan to strict censorship laws, pornography was not considered an important offence and generally met with the censors' approval. Many of these prints displayed a high level a draughtsmanship, and often humour, in their explicit depictions of bedroom scenes, voyeurs, and oversized anatomy. As with depictions of courtesans, these images were closely tied to entertainments of the pleasure quarters. Nearly every ukiyo-e master produced shunga at some point. Records of societal acceptance of shunga are absent, though Timon Screech posits that there were almost certainly some concerns over the matter, and that its level of acceptability has been exaggerated by later collectors, especially in the West.\nScenes from nature have been an important part of Asian art throughout history. Artists have closely studied the correct forms and anatomy of plants and animals, even though depictions of human anatomy remained more fanciful until modern times. Ukiyo-e nature prints are called , which translates as \"flower-and-bird pictures\", though the genre was open to more than just flowers or birds, and the flowers and birds did not necessarily appear together. Hokusai's detailed, precise nature prints are credited with establishing as a genre.\nThe Tenp\u014d Reforms of the 1840s suppressed the depiction of actors and courtesans. Aside from landscapes and , artists turned to depictions of historical scenes, such as of ancient warriors or of scenes from legend, literature, and religion. The 11th century \"Tale of Genji\" and the 13th-century \"Tale of the Heike\" have been sources of artistic inspiration throughout Japanese history, including in ukiyo-e. Well-known warriors and swordsmen such as Miyamoto Musashi (1584\u20131645) were frequent subjects, as were depictions of monsters, the supernatural, and heroes of Japanese and Chinese mythology.\nFrom the 17th to 19th centuries, Japan isolated itself from the rest of the world. Trade, primarily with the Dutch and Chinese, was restricted to the island of Dejima near Nagasaki. Outlandish pictures called were sold to tourists of the foreigners and their wares. In the mid-19th century, Yokohama became the primary foreign settlement after 1859, from which Western knowledge proliferated in Japan. Especially from 1858 to 1862, prints documented, with various levels of fact and fancy, the growing community of world denizens with whom the Japanese were now coming in contact; triptychs of scenes of Westerners and their technology were particularly popular.\nSpecialized prints included , deluxe, limited-edition prints aimed at connoisseurs, of which a five-line poem was usually part of the design; and printed hand fans, which often suffer from having been handled.\nProduction.\nPaintings.\nUkiyo-e artists often made both prints and paintings; some specialized in one or the other. In contrast with previous traditions, ukiyo-e painters favoured bright, sharp colours, and often delineated contours with ink, an effect similar to the linework in prints. Unrestricted by the technical limitations of printing, a wider range of techniques, pigments, and surfaces were available to the painter. Artists painted with pigments made from mineral or organic substances, such as safflower, ground shells, lead, and cinnabar, and later synthetic dyes imported from the West such as Paris green and Prussian blue. Silk or paper hanging scrolls, handscrolls, or folding screens were the most common surfaces.\nPrint production.\nUkiyo-e prints were the works of teams of artisans in several workshops; it was rare for designers to cut their own woodblocks. Labour was divided into four groups: the publisher, who commissioned, promoted, and distributed the prints; the artists, who provided the design image; the woodcarvers, who prepared the woodblocks for printing; and the printers, who made impressions of the woodblocks on paper. Normally only the names of the artist and publisher were credited on the finished print.\nUkiyo-e prints were impressed on hand-made paper manually, rather than by mechanical press as in the West. The artist provided an ink drawing on thin paper, which was pasted to a block of cherry wood and rubbed with oil until the upper layers of paper could be pulled away, leaving a translucent layer of paper that the block-cutter could use as a guide. The block-cutter cut away the non-black areas of the image, leaving raised areas that were inked to leave an impression. The original drawing was destroyed in the process.\nPrints were made with blocks face up so the printer could vary pressure for different effects, and watch as paper absorbed the water-based ink, applied quickly in even horizontal strokes. Amongst the printer's tricks were embossing of the image, achieved by pressing an uninked woodblock on the paper to achieve effects, such as the textures of clothing patterns or fishing net. Other effects included burnishing rubbing the paper with agate to brighten colours; varnishing; overprinting; dusting with metal or mica; and sprays to imitate falling snow.\nThe ukiyo-e print was a commercial art form, and the publisher played an important role. Publishing was highly competitive; over a thousand publishers are known from throughout the period. The number peaked at around 250 in the 1840s and 1850s\u2014200 in Edo alone\u2014and slowly shrank following the opening of Japan until about 40 remained at the opening of the 20th century. The publishers owned the woodblocks and copyrights, and from the late 18th century enforced copyrights through the Picture Book and Print Publishers Guild. Prints that went through several pressings were particularly profitable, as the publisher could reuse the woodblocks without further payment to the artist or woodblock cutter. The woodblocks were also traded or sold to other publishers or pawnshops. Publishers were usually also vendors, and commonly sold each other's wares in their shops. In addition to the artist's seal, publishers marked the prints with their own seals\u2014some a simple logo, others quite elaborate, incorporating an address or other information.\nPrint designers went through apprenticeship before being granted the right to produce prints of their own that they could sign with their own names. Young designers could be expected to cover part or all of the costs of cutting the woodblocks. As the artists gained fame, publishers usually covered these costs, and artists could demand higher fees.\nIn pre-modern Japan, people could go by numerous names throughout their lives, their childhood personal name different from their name as an adult. An artist's name consisted of a \u2014an artist surname\u2014followed by an personal art name. The was most frequently taken from the school the artist belonged to, such as Utagawa or Torii, and the normally took a Chinese character from the master's art name\u2014for example, many students of Toyokuni () took the from his name, including Kunisada () and Kuniyoshi (). The names artists signed to their works can be a source of confusion as they sometimes changed names through their careers; Hokusai was an extreme case, using over a hundred names throughout his 70-year career.\nThe prints were mass-marketed, and by the mid-19th century, the total circulation of a print could run into the thousands. Retailers and travelling sellers promoted them at prices affordable to prosperous townspeople. In some cases, the prints advertised kimono designs by the print artist. From the second half of the 17th century, prints were frequently marketed as part of a series, each print stamped with the series name and the print's number in that series. This proved a successful marketing technique, as collectors bought each new print in the series to keep their collections complete. By the 19th century, series such as Hiroshige's \"Fifty-three Stations of the T\u014dkaid\u014d\" ran to dozens of prints.\nColour print production.\nWhile colour printing in Japan dates to the 1640s, early ukiyo-e prints used only black ink. Colour was sometimes added by hand, using a red lead ink in prints, or later in a pink safflower ink in prints. Colour printing arrived in books in the 1720s and in single-sheet prints in the 1740s, with a different block and printing for each colour. Early colours were limited to pink and green; techniques expanded over the following two decades to allow up to five colours. The mid-1760s brought full-colour prints made from ten or more woodblocks. To keep the blocks for each colour aligned correctly, registration marks called were placed on one corner and an adjacent side.\nPrinters first used natural colour dyes made from mineral or vegetable sources. The dyes had a translucent quality that allowed a variety of colours to be mixed from primary red, blue, and yellow pigments. In the 18th century, Prussian blue became popular, and was particularly prominent in the landscapes of Hokusai and Hiroshige, as was , where the printer produced gradations of colour or blended one colour into another. Cheaper and more consistent synthetic aniline dyes arrived from the West in 1864. The colours were harsher and brighter than traditional pigments. The Meiji government promoted their use as part of broader policies of Westernization.\nCriticism and historiography.\nContemporary records of ukiyo-e artists are rare. The most significant is the (\"Various Thoughts on ukiyo-e\"), a collection of commentaries and artist biographies. \u014cta Nanpo compiled the first, no-longer-extant version around 1790. The work did not see print during the Edo era, but circulated in hand-copied editions that were subject to numerous additions and alterations; over 120 variants of the are known.\nBefore World War II, the predominant view of ukiyo-e stressed the centrality of prints; this viewpoint ascribes ukiyo-e's founding to Moronobu. Following the war, thinking turned to the importance of ukiyo-e painting and making direct connections with 17th century paintings; this viewpoint sees Matabei as the genre's originator, and is especially favoured in Japan. This view had become widespread among Japanese researchers by the 1930s, but the militaristic government of the time suppressed it, wanting to emphasize a division between the scroll paintings associated with the court, and the prints associated with the sometimes anti-authoritarian merchant class.\nThe earliest comprehensive historical and critical works on ukiyo-e came from the West. Ernest Fenollosa was Professor of Philosophy at the Imperial University in Tokyo from 1878, and was Commissioner of Fine Arts to the Japanese government from 1886. His \"Masters of Ukioye\" of 1896 was the first comprehensive overview and set the stage for most later works with an approach to the history in terms of epochs: beginning with Matabei in a primitive age, it evolved towards a late-18th century golden age that began to decline with the advent of Utamaro, and had a brief revival with Hokusai and Hiroshige's landscapes in the 1830s. Laurence Binyon, the Keeper of Oriental Prints and Drawings at the British Museum, wrote an account in \"Painting in the Far East\" in 1908 that was similar to Fenollosa's, but placed Utamaro and Sharaku amongst the masters. Arthur Davison Ficke built on the works of Fenollosa and Binyon with a more comprehensive \"Chats on Japanese Prints\" in 1915. James\u00a0A. Michener's \"The Floating World\" in 1954 broadly followed the chronologies of the earlier works, while dropping classifications into periods and recognizing the earlier artists not as primitives but as accomplished masters emerging from earlier painting traditions. For Michener and his sometime collaborator Richard Lane, ukiyo-e began with Moronobu rather than Matabei. Lane's \"Masters of the Japanese Print\" of 1962 maintained the approach of period divisions while placing ukiyo-e firmly within the genealogy of Japanese art. The book acknowledges artists such as Yoshitoshi and Kiyochika as late masters.\nSeiichir\u014d Takahashi's \"Traditional Woodblock Prints of Japan\" of 1964 placed ukiyo-e artists in three periods: the first was a primitive period that included Harunobu, followed by a golden age of Kiyonaga, Utamaro, and Sharaku, and then a closing period of decline following the declaration beginning in the 1790s of strict sumptuary laws that dictated what could be depicted in artworks. The book nevertheless recognizes a larger number of masters from throughout this last period than earlier works had, and viewed ukiyo-e painting as a revival of painting. Tadashi Kobayashi further refined Takahashi's analysis by identifying the decline as coinciding with the desperate attempts of the shogunate to hold on to power through the passing of draconian laws as its hold on the country continued to break down, culminating in the Meiji Restoration in 1868.\nUkiyo-e scholarship has tended to focus on the cataloguing of artists, an approach that lacks the rigour and originality that has come to be applied to art analysis in other areas. Such catalogues are numerous, but tend overwhelmingly to concentrate on a group of recognized geniuses. Little original research has been added to the early, foundational evaluations of ukiyo-e and its artists, especially with regard to relatively minor artists. While the commercial nature of ukiyo-e has always been acknowledged, evaluation of artists and their works has rested on the aesthetic preferences of connoisseurs and paid little heed to contemporary commercial success.\nStandards for inclusion in the ukiyo-e canon rapidly evolved in the early literature. Utamaro was particularly contentious, seen by Fenollosa and others as a degenerate symbol of ukiyo-e's decline; Utamaro has since gained general acceptance as one of the form's greatest masters. Artists of the 19th century such as Yoshitoshi were ignored or marginalized, attracting scholarly attention only towards the end of the 20th century. Works on late-era Utagawa artists such as Kunisada and Kuniyoshi have revived some of the contemporary esteem these artists enjoyed. Many late works examine the social or other conditions behind the art, and are unconcerned with valuations that would place it in a period of decline.\nNovelist Jun'ichir\u014d Tanizaki was critical of the superior attitude of Westerners who claimed a higher aestheticism in purporting to have discovered ukiyo-e. He maintained that ukiyo-e was merely the easiest form of Japanese art to understand from the perspective of Westerners' values, and that Japanese of all social strata enjoyed ukiyo-e, but that Confucian morals of the time kept them from freely discussing it, social mores that were violated by the West's flaunting of the discovery.\nSince the dawn of the 20th century historians of manga\u2014Japanese comics and cartooning\u2014have developed narratives connecting the art form to pre-20th century Japanese art. Particular emphasis falls on the \"Hokusai Manga\" as a precursor, though Hokusai's book is not narrative, nor does the term \"manga\" originate with Hokusai. In English and other languages, the word \"manga\" is used in the restrictive sense of \"Japanese comics\" or \"Japanese-style comics\", while in Japanese it indicates all forms of comics, cartooning, and caricature.\nCollection and preservation.\nThe ruling classes strictly limited the space permitted for the homes of the social classes below them; the relatively small size of ukiyo-e works was ideal for hanging in these homes. Little record of the patrons of ukiyo-e paintings has survived. They sold for considerably higher prices than prints\u2014up to many thousands of times more, and thus must have been purchased by the wealthy, likely merchants and perhaps some from the samurai class. Late-era prints are the most numerous extant examples, as they were produced in the greatest quantities in the 19th century, and the older a print is the less chance it had of surviving. Ukiyo-e was largely associated with Edo, and visitors to Edo often bought what they called as souvenirs. Shops that sold them might specialize in products such as hand-held fans, or offer a diverse selection.\nThe ukiyo-e print market was highly diversified as it sold to a heterogeneous public, from dayworkers to wealthy merchants. Little concrete information is known about production and consumption habits. Detailed records in Edo were kept of a wide variety of courtesans, actors, and sumo wrestlers, but no such records pertaining to ukiyo-e remain\u2014or perhaps ever existed. Determining what is understood about the demographics of ukiyo-e consumption has required indirect means.\nDetermining at what prices prints sold is a challenge for experts, as records of hard figures are scanty and there was great variety in the production quality, size, supply and demand, and methods, which went through changes such as the introduction of full-colour printing. How expensive prices can be considered is also difficult to determine as social and economic conditions were in flux throughout the period. In the 19th century, records survive of prints selling from as low as 16 to 100 for deluxe editions. Jun'ichi \u014ckubo suggests that prices in the 1920s and 1930s of were likely common for standard prints. As a loose comparison, a bowl of soba noodles in the early 19th century typically sold for 16 .\nThe dyes in ukiyo-e prints are susceptible to fading when exposed even to low levels of light; this makes long-term display undesirable. The paper they are printed on deteriorates when it comes in contact with acidic materials, so storage boxes, folders, and mounts must be of neutral pH or alkaline. Prints should be regularly inspected for problems needing treatment, and stored at a relative humidity of 70% or less to prevent fungal discolourations.\nThe paper and pigments in ukiyo-e paintings are sensitive to light and seasonal changes in humidity. Mounts must be flexible, as the sheets can tear under sharp changes in humidity. In the Edo era, the sheets were mounted on long-fibred paper and preserved scrolled up in plain paulownia wood boxes placed in another lacquer wooden box. In museum settings, display times are heavily limited to prevent deterioration from exposure to light and environmental pollution, and care is taken in the unrolling and rerolling of scrolls, with scrolling causing concavities in the paper, and the unrolling and rerolling of the scrolls causing creasing. The humidity levels that scrolls are kept in are generally between 50 percent and 60 percent, as scrolls kept in too dry an atmosphere become brittle.\nBecause ukiyo-e prints were mass-produced, collecting them presents considerations different from the collecting of paintings. There is wide variation in the condition, rarity, cost, and quality of extant prints. Prints may have stains, foxing, wormholes, tears, creases, or dogmarks, the colours may have faded, or they may have been retouched. Carvers may have altered the colours or composition of prints that went through multiple editions. When cut after printing, the paper may have been trimmed within the margin. Values of prints depend on a variety of factors, including the artist's reputation, print condition, rarity, and whether it is an original pressing\u2014even high-quality later printings will fetch a fraction of the valuation of an original.\nUkiyo-e prints often went through multiple editions, sometimes with changes made to the blocks in later editions. Editions made from recut woodblocks also circulate, such as legitimate later reproductions, as well as pirate editions and other fakes. Takamizawa Enji (1870\u20131927), a producer of ukiyo-e reproductions, developed a method of recutting woodblocks to print fresh colour on faded originals, over which he used tobacco ash to make the fresh ink seem aged. These refreshed prints he resold as original printings. Amongst the defrauded collectors was American architect Frank Lloyd Wright, who brought Takamizawa prints with him from Japan to the US, some of which he had sold before the truth was discovered.\nUkiyo-e artists are referred to in the Japanese style, the surname preceding the personal name, and well-known artists such as Utamaro and Hokusai by personal name alone. Dealers normally refer to ukiyo-e prints by the names of the standard sizes, most commonly the , the , and the \u2014precise sizes vary, and paper was often trimmed after printing.\nMany of the largest high-quality collections of ukiyo-e lie outside Japan. Examples entered the collection of the National Library of France in the first half of the 19th century. The British Museum began a collection in 1860 that by the late 20th century numbered items. The largest, surpassing items, resides in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, begun when Ernest Fenollosa donated his collection in 1912. The first exhibition in Japan of ukiyo-e prints was likely one presented by K\u014djir\u014d Matsukata in 1925, who amassed his collection in Paris during World War\u00a0I and later donated it to the National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo. The largest collection of ukiyo-e in Japan is the pieces in the Japan Ukiyo-e Museum in the city of Matsumoto.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nAcademic journals.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBooks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWeb.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is spoken in the Baltic region, and is the language of the Latvians. It is the official language of Latvia as well as one of the official languages of the European Union. There are about 1.5 million native Latvian speakers in Latvia and 100,000 abroad. Of those, around 1.16 million or 62% of Latvia's population used it as their primary language at home, though excluding the Latgale and Riga regions it is spoken as a native language in villages and towns by over 90% of the population.\nAs a Baltic language, Latvian is most closely related to neighboring Lithuanian (as well as Old Prussian, an extinct Baltic language); however, Latvian has developed in different directions. In addition, there is some disagreement whether Standard Latgalian and Kursenieki, which are mutually intelligible with Latvian, should be considered varieties or separate languages.\nLatvian first appeared in print in the mid-16th century with the reproduction of the Lord's Prayer in Latvian in Sebastian M\u00fcnster's (1544), in Latin script.\nClassification.\nLatvian belongs to the Indo-European language family. It is classified as a part of the Baltic branch of the family. It is one of two living Baltic languages with an official status, the other being Lithuanian. The Latvian and Lithuanian languages have retained many features of the nominal morphology of Proto-Indo-European, though their phonology and verbal morphology show many innovations (in other words, forms that did not exist in Proto-Indo-European), with Latvian being considerably more innovative than Lithuanian. However, Latvian has mutual influences with the Livonian language. \nHistory.\nOrigins.\nAccording to some glottochronological speculations, the East Baltic languages split from West Baltic (or, perhaps, from the hypothetical proto-Baltic language) between 400 and 600 CE. The differentiation between Lithuanian and Latvian started after 800 CE. At a minimum, transitional dialects existed until the 14th century or 15th century, and perhaps as late as the 17th century.\nLatvian as a distinct language emerged over several centuries from the language spoken by the ancient Latgalians assimilating the languages of other neighboring Baltic tribes\u2014Curonian, Semigallian, and Selonian\u2014which resulted in these languages gradually losing their most distinct characteristics. This process of consolidation started in the 13th century after the Livonian Crusade and forced christianization, which formed a unified political, economic, and religious space in Medieval Livonia.\n16th\u201318th century.\nThe oldest known examples of written Latvian are from a 1530 translation of a hymn made by Nikolaus Ramm, a German pastor in Riga. The oldest preserved book in Latvian is a 1585 Catholic catechism of Petrus Canisius currently located at the Uppsala University Library in Sweden.\nThe first person to translate the Bible into Latvian was the German Lutheran pastor Johann Ernst Gl\u00fcck (The New Testament in 1685 and The Old Testament in 1691). The Lutheran pastor Gotthard Friedrich Stender was a founder of Latvian secular literature. He wrote the first illustrated Latvian alphabet book (1787), the first encyclopedia \"The Book of High Wisdom of the World and Nature\" (; 1774), grammar books and Latvian\u2013German and German\u2013Latvian dictionaries.\n19th century.\nUntil the 19th century, the Latvian written language was influenced by German Lutheran pastors and the German language, because Baltic Germans formed the upper class of local society. In the middle of the 19th century the First Latvian National Awakening was started, led by \"Young Latvians\" who popularized the use of Latvian language. Participants in this movement laid the foundations for standard Latvian and also popularized the Latvianization of loan words. However, in the 1880s, when Czar Alexander III came into power, Russification started.\nAccording to the 1897 Imperial Russian Census, there were 505,994 (75.1%) speakers of Latvian in the Governorate of Courland and 563,829 (43.4%) speakers of Latvian in the Governorate of Livonia, making Latvian-speakers the largest linguistic group in each of the governorates.\n20th century.\nAfter the death of Alexander III at the end of the 19th century, Latvian nationalist movements re-emerged. In 1908, Latvian linguists K\u0101rlis M\u012blenbahs and J\u0101nis Endzel\u012bns elaborated the modern Latvian alphabet, which slowly replaced the old orthography used before. Another feature of the language, in common with its sister language Lithuanian, that was developed at that time is that proper names from other countries and languages are altered phonetically to fit the phonological system of Latvian, even if the original language also uses the Latin alphabet. Moreover, the names are modified to ensure that they have noun declension endings, declining like all other nouns. For example, a place such as Lecropt (a Scottish parish) is likely to become Lekropta; the Scottish village of Tillicoultry becomes Tilikutrija.\nAfter the Soviet occupation of Latvia, the policy of Russification greatly affected the Latvian language. At the same time, the use of Latvian among the Latvians in Russia had already dwindled after the so-called 1937\u20131938 Latvian Operation of the NKVD, during which at least 16,573 ethnic Latvians and Latvian nationals were executed. In the 1941 June deportation and the 1949 Operation Priboi, tens of thousands of Latvians and other ethnicities were deported from Latvia. Massive immigration from the Russian SFSR, Ukrainian SSR, Byelorussian SSR, and other republics of the Soviet Union followed, primarily as a result of Stalin's plan to integrate Latvia and the other Baltic republics into the Soviet Union through colonization. As a result, the proportion of the ethnic Latvian population within the total population was reduced from 80% in 1935 to 52% in 1989. In Soviet Latvia, most of the immigrants who settled in the country did not learn Latvian. According to the 2011 census Latvian was the language spoken at home by 62% of the country's population.\nAfter the re-establishment of independence in 1991, a new policy of language education was introduced. The primary declared goal was the integration of all inhabitants into the environment of the official state language while protecting the languages of Latvia's ethnic minorities.\nGovernment-funded bilingual education was available in primary schools for ethnic minorities until 2019 when Parliament decided on educating only in Latvian. Minority schools are available for Russian, Yiddish, Polish, Lithuanian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Estonian and Roma languages. Latvian is taught as a second language in the initial stages too, as is officially declared, to encourage proficiency in that language, aiming at avoiding alienation from the Latvian-speaking linguistic majority and for the sake of facilitating academic and professional achievements. Since the mid-1990s, the government may pay a student's tuition in public universities only provided that the instruction is in Latvian. Since 2004, the state mandates Latvian as the language of instruction in public secondary schools (Form 10\u201312) for at least 60% of class work (previously, a broad system of education in Russian existed).\nAltogether, 2 million, or 80% of the population of Latvia, spoke Latvian in the 2000s, before the total number of inhabitants of Latvia slipped to 1.8 million in 2022.\nThe Official Language Law was adopted on 9 December 1999. Several regulatory acts associated with this law have been adopted. Observance of the law is monitored by the Latvian State Language Center run by the Ministry of Justice.\n21st century.\nTo counter the influence of English, government organizations (namely the Terminology Commission of the Latvian Academy of Science and the State Language Center) popularize the use of Latvian terms. A debate arose over the Latvian term for euro. The Terminology Commission suggested or , with their Latvianized and declinable ending, would be a better term for euro than the widely used , while European Central Bank insisted that the original name \"euro\" be used in all languages. New terms are Latvian derivatives, calques or new loanwords. For example, Latvian has two words for \"telephone\"\u2014 and , the former being a direct translation into Latvian of the latter international term. Still, others are older or more euphonic loanwords rather than Latvian words. For example, \"computer\" can be either or . Both are loanwords; the native Latvian word for \"computer\" is , which is also an official term. However, now has been considered an appropriate translation, is also used.\nThere are several contests held annually to promote the correct use of Latvian. One of them is \"Word of the year\" () organized by the Riga Latvian Society since 2003. It features categories such as the \"Best word\", \"Worst word\", \"Best saying\" and \"Word salad\". In 2018 the word (instant payment) won the category of \"Best word\" and (influencer) won the category of \"Worst word\". The word pair of (stream) and (streaming) were named the best words of 2017, while as an unnecessary plural of the name for transport was chosen as the worst word of 2017.\nDialects.\nThere are three dialects in Latvian: the Livonic dialect, High Latvian and the Central dialect. Latvian dialects and their varieties should not be confused with the Livonian, Curonian, Semigallian and Selonian languages.\nLivonic dialect.\nThe Livonic dialect (also called \"Tamian\" or \"t\u0101mnieku\") of Latvian was more affected by the Livonian language substratum than Latvian in other parts of Latvia. It is divided into the Vidzeme variety and the Courland variety (also called \"t\u0101mnieku\"). There are two syllable intonations in the Livonic dialect, extended and broken. In the Livonic dialect, short vowels at the end of words are discarded, while long vowels are shortened. In all numbers, only one form of the verb is used. Due to migration and the introduction of a standardised language, this dialect has declined. It arose from assimilated Livonians, who started to speak in Latvian.\nCentral dialect.\nThe Central dialect spoken in central and Southwestern Latvia is the basis of standard Latvian. The dialect is divided into the Vidzeme variety, the Curonic variety and the Semigallic variety. The Vidzeme variety and the Semigallic variety are closer to each other than to the Curonic variety, which is more archaic than the other two. There are three syllable intonations in some parts of Vidzeme variety of the Central dialect, extended, broken and falling. The Curonic and Semigallic varieties have two syllable intonations, extended and broken, but some parts of the Vidzeme variety have extended and falling intonations. In the Curonic variety, \"\u0157\" is still used. The Kursenieki language, a historic variety of Latvian, which used to be spoken along Curonian Spit, is closely related to the varieties of the Central dialect spoken in Courland.\nHigh Latvian dialect.\nHigh Latvian dialect is spoken in Eastern Latvia. It is set apart from the rest of the Latvian by a number of phonological differences. The dialect has two main varieties \u2013 Selonic (two syllable intonations, falling and rising) and Non-Selonic (falling and broken syllable intonations). There is a standard language, i.e., the Standard Latgalian, another historic variety of Latvian, which is based on deep non-Selonic varieties spoken in the south of Latgale. The term \"Latgalic\" is sometimes also applied to all non-Selonic varieties or even the whole dialect. However, it is unclear if using the term for any varieties besides the standard language is accurate. While the term may refer to varieties spoken in Latgale or by Latgalians, not all speakers identify as speaking Latgalic; for example, speakers of deep Non-Selonic varieties in Vidzeme explicitly deny speaking Latgalic. It is spoken by approximately 15% of Latvia's population, but almost all of its speakers are also fluent in the standard Latvian language and they promote the dialect in popular culture in order to preserve their distinct culture. The Latvian Government since 1990 has also taken measures to protect the dialect from extinction.\nNon-native speakers.\nThe history of the Latvian language (see below) has placed it in a peculiar position for a language of its size, whereby many non-native speakers speak it compared to native speakers. The immigrant and minority population in Latvia is 700,000 people: Russians, Belarusians, Ukrainians, Poles, and others. The majority of immigrants settled in Latvia between 1940 and 1991; supplementing pre-existing ethnic minority communities (Latvian Germans, Latvian Jews, Latvian Russians). The trends show that the proficiency of Latvian among its non-native speakers is gradually increasing. In a 2009 survey by the Latvian Language Agency 56% percent of respondents with Russian as their native language described having a good knowledge of Latvian, whereas for the younger generation (from 17 to 25 years) the number was 64%.\nThe increased adoption of Latvian by minorities was brought about by its status as the country's only official language and other changes in the society after the fall of the Soviet Union that mostly shifted linguistic focus away from Russian. As an example, in 2007, universities and colleges for the first time received applications from prospective students who had a bilingual secondary education in schools for minorities. Fluency in Latvian is expected in a variety of professions and careers.\nGrammar.\nLatvian grammar represents a classic Indo-European (Baltic) system with well developed inflection and derivation. Word stress, with some exceptions in derivation and inflection, more often is on the first syllable. There are no articles in Latvian; definiteness is expressed by an inflection of adjectives. Basic word order in Latvian is subject\u2013verb\u2013object; however, word order is relatively free.\nNouns.\nThere are two grammatical genders in Latvian (masculine and feminine) and two numbers, singular and plural. Nouns, adjectives, and declinable participles decline into seven cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental, locative, and vocative. There are six declensions for nouns.\nVerbs.\nThere are three conjugation classes in Latvian. Verbs are conjugated for person, tense, mood and voice.\nOrthography.\nLatvian in Latin script was first based upon the German orthography, while the alphabet of the Standard Latgalian variety was based on the Polish orthography. At the beginning of the 20th century, it was replaced by a more phonologically consistent orthography.\nStandard orthography.\nToday, the Latvian standard orthography employs 33 characters:\nThe modern standard Latvian alphabet uses 22 unmodified letters of the Latin alphabet (all except \u27e8q, w, x, y\u27e9, which are usually replaced by \u27e8k(v)\u27e9, \u27e8v\u27e9, \u27e8ks\u27e9, and \u27e8i/j\u27e9 respectively in loanwords and even in foreign names, though they may appear in certain specialized terms such as \"status quo\"; \"W\" can be found in older texts, \"Y\" can be found in the Latgalian language/dialect). It adds a further eleven characters by modification. The vowel letters \u27e8a\u27e9, \u27e8e\u27e9, \u27e8i\u27e9 and \u27e8u\u27e9 can take a macron to show length, unmodified letters being short; these letters are not differentiated while sorting (e.g. in dictionaries). The letters \u27e8c\u27e9, \u27e8s\u27e9 and \u27e8z\u27e9 are pronounced , and respectively, while when marked with a caron, \u27e8\u010d, \u0161, \u017e\u27e9, they are pronounced , and respectively. The letters \u27e8\u0123, \u0137, \u013c, \u0146\u27e9, written with a comma placed underneath (or above them for lowercase \"g\"), which indicate palatalized versions of \u27e8g, k, l, n\u27e9 representing the sounds , , and . Latvian orthography also contains nine digraphs, which are written \u27e8ai, au, ei, ie, iu, ui, oi, dz, d\u017e\u27e9. Non-standard varieties of Latvian add extra letters to this standard set.\nLatvian spelling has almost one-to-one correspondence between graphemes and phonemes. Every phoneme corresponds to a letter so that the reader can almost always pronounce words by putting the letters together. There are only two exceptions to this consistency in the orthography: the letters \u27e8e, \u0113\u27e9 represent two different sounds: and . The second mismatch is that letter \u27e8o\u27e9 indicates both the short and long , and the diphthong . These three sounds are written as \u27e8o\u27e9, \u27e8\u014d\u27e9 and \u27e8uo\u27e9 in Standard Latgalian, and some Latvians campaign for the adoption of this system in standard Latvian. However, Latvian grammarians argue that \u27e8o\u27e9 and \u27e8\u014d\u27e9 are found only in loanwords, with the sound being the only native Latvian phoneme. The digraph \u27e8uo\u27e9 was discarded in 1914, and the letters \u27e8\u014d\u27e9 and \u27e8\u0157\u27e9 have not been used in the official Latvian language since 1946. Likewise, the digraph \u27e8ch\u27e9 was discarded in 1957, although \u27e8\u014d\u27e9, \u27e8\u0157\u27e9, and \u27e8ch\u27e9 are still used in some varieties and by many Latvians living beyond the borders of Latvia. The letter \u27e8y\u27e9 is used only in Standard Latgalian, where it represents , a sound not present in other dialects.\nOld orthography.\nThe old orthography was based on German and did not represent the Latvian language phonemically. Initially, it was used to write religious texts for German priests to help them in their work with Latvians. The first writings in Latvian were chaotic: twelve variations for writing \"\u0160\" existed, for example. In 1631 the German priest Georg Mancelius tried to systematize the writing. He wrote long vowels according to their position in the word\u00a0\u2013 a short vowel followed by \"h\" for a radical vowel, a short vowel in the suffix, and vowel with a diacritic mark in the ending indicating two accents. Consonants were written using multiple letters following the example of German. The old orthography was used until the 20th century when modern orthography slowly replaced it.\nLatvian on computers.\nIn late 1992, the official Latvian computing standard LVS 8-92 took effect. It was followed by LVS 24-93 (Latvian language support for computers) that also specified the way Latvian language (alphabet, numbers, currency, punctuation marks, date and time) should be represented on computers. A Latvian ergonomic keyboard standard LVS 23-93 was also announced several months later, but it did not gain popularity due to its need for a custom-built keyboard.\nNowadays standard QWERTY or the US keyboards are used for writing in Latvian; diacritics are entered by using a dead key (usually ', occasionally ~). Some keyboard layouts use the modifier key AltGr (most notably the Windows 2000 and XP built-in layout (Latvian QWERTY), it is also default modifier in X11R6, thus a default in most Linux distributions).\nIn the 1990s, lack of software support of diacritics caused an unofficial style of orthography, often called \"translits\", to emerge for use in situations when the user is unable to access Latvian diacritic marks (e-mail, newsgroups, web user forums, chat, SMS etc.). It uses the basic Modern Latin alphabet only, and letters that are not used in standard orthography are usually omitted. In this style, diacritics are replaced by digraphs\u00a0\u2013 a doubled letter indicates a long vowel (as in Finnish and Estonian); a following \"j\" indicates palatalisation of consonants, i.e., a cedilla; and the postalveolars \"\u0160\", \"\u010c\" and \"\u017d\" are written with \"h\" replacing the h\u00e1\u010dek, as in English. Sometimes the second letter, the one used instead of a diacritic, is changed to one of two other diacritic letters (e.g. \u0161 is written as ss or sj, not sh), and since many people may find it difficult to use these unusual methods, they write without any indication of missing diacritic marks, or they use digraphing only if the diacritic mark in question would make a semantic difference. Sometimes an apostrophe is used before or after the character that would properly need to be diacriticised. Also, digraph diacritics are often used and sometimes even mixed with diacritical letters of standard orthography. Although today there is software support available, diacritic-less writing is still sometimes used for financial and social reasons. As \"\u0161\" and \"\u017e\" are part of the Windows-1252 coding, it is possible to input those two letters using a numerical keypad. Latvian language code for cmd and .bat files - Windows-1257\nComparative orthography.\nFor example, the Lord's Prayer in Latvian written in different styles:\nPhonology.\nConsonants.\nConsonants in consonant sequences assimilate to the voicing of the subsequent consonant, e.g. apgabals or labs . Latvian does not feature final-obstruent devoicing.\nConsonants can be long (written as double consonants) , or short. Plosives and fricatives occurring between two short vowels are lengthened: . Same with 'zs' that is pronounced as , \u0161s and \u017es as .\nVowels.\nLatvian has six vowels, with length as distinctive feature:\n, and the diphthongs involving it other than , are confined to loanwords.\nLatvian also has 10 diphthongs, four of which are only found in loanwords (), although some diphthongs are mostly limited to proper names and interjections.\nSyllable accent.\nStandard Latvian and, with some exceptions in derivation and inflection, all of the Latvian dialects have fixed initial stress. Long vowels and diphthongs have a tone, regardless of their position in the word. This includes the so-called \"mixed diphthongs\" composed of a short vowel followed by a sonorant.\nLoanwords.\nDuring the period of Livonia, many Middle Low German words such as \"amats\" (profession), \"dambis\" (dam), \"b\u016bv\u0113t\" (to build) and \"bikses\" (trousers) were borrowed into Latvian, while the period of Swedish Livonia brought loanwords like \"skurstenis\" (chimney) from Swedish. It also has loanwords from the Finnic languages, mainly from Livonian and Estonian. There are about 500 to 600 borrowings from Finnic languages in Latvian, for example: \"m\u0101ja\" \u2018house\u2019 (Liv. \"m\u014dj\"), \"puika\" \u2018boy\u2019 (Liv. \"p\u016boga\"), \"p\u012bl\u0101dzis\" \u2018mountain ash\u2019 (Liv. \"p\u012b\u2019l\u00f5g\"), \"s\u0113ne\" \u2018mushroom\u2019 (Liv. \"s\u0113\u0146\").\nLoanwords from other Baltic language include \"\u0137ermenis\" (body) from Old Prussian, as well as \"veikals\" (store) and \"pa\u0123iras\" (hangover) from Lithuanian.\nHistory of the study.\nThe first Latvian dictionary \"Lettus\" compiled by Georg Mancelius was published in 1638.\nThe first grammar of the Latvian language is a short \u201cManual on the Latvian language\u201d () by Johans Georgs Reheh\u016bzens, published in 1644 in Riga.\nExample text.\nArticle 1 of the \"Universal Declaration of Human Rights\" in Latvian:\nArticle 1 of the \"Universal Declaration of Human Rights\" in English:\n\"All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The concept spread from the beginning of the nineteenth century.\nDegrees.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, common degrees in business are:\nGraduates in business may also have generically titled degrees such as Bachelor of Science (BS), Master of Science (MS) or Doctor of Philosophy (PhD).\nEurope.\nIn Europe, higher education degrees are organized into three cycles under the Bologna Process in order to facilitate international mobility: bachelor's, master's and doctorates. The details of how degrees are organized vary between countries and institutions, but in terms of ECTS credits, where 60 credits represents a full academic year's work, a bachelor's degree typically requires 180\u2013240 credits and a master's degree 90\u2013120 credits.\nFrance.\nIn France, those levels of study include various \"parcours\" or paths based on UE (\"unit\u00e9s d'enseignement\" or modules), each worth a defined number of ECTS credits. \"Grande \u00e9cole\" business schools are elite academic institutions that admit students through an extremely competitive process, and the PGE (\"Programme Grande \u00c9cole\") ends with the degree of Master in Management (MiM).\nCase studies.\nSome business schools structure their teaching around the use of case studies (i.e. the case method). Case studies have been used in graduate and undergraduate business education for nearly one hundred years. Business cases are historical descriptions of actual business situations. Typically, information is presented about a business firm's products, markets, competition, financial structure, sales volumes, management, employees and other factors influencing the firm's success. The length of a business case study may range from two or three pages to 30 pages, or more.\nStudents are expected to scrutinize the case study and prepare to discuss strategies and tactics that the firm should employ in the future. Three different methods have been used in business case teaching:\nHistory of business cases.\nWhen Harvard Business School started operating in 1908, the faculty realized that there were no textbooks suitable for a graduate program in business. Their first solution to this problem involved interviewing leading practitioners of business and writing detailed accounts of what these managers were doing, based partly on the case method already in use at Harvard Law School. Of course, the professors could not present these cases as practices to be emulated, because there were no criteria available for determining what would succeed and what would not succeed. So the professors instructed their students to read the cases and to come to class prepared to discuss the cases and to offer recommendations for appropriate courses of action. The basic outlines of this method still operate in business-school curricula as of 2016[ [update]].\nOther approaches.\nIn contrast to the case method some schools use a skills-based approach in teaching business. This approach emphasizes quantitative methods, in particular operations research, management information systems, statistics, organizational behavior, modeling and simulation, and decision science. The leading institution in this method is the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University. The goal is to provide students a set of tools that will prepare them to tackle and solve problems.\nAnother important approach used in business school is the use of business games that are used in different disciplines such as business, economics, management, etc. Some colleges are blending many of these approaches throughout their degree programs, and even blending the method of delivery for each of these approaches. A study from by Inside Higher Ed and the Babson Survey Research Group shows that there is still disagreement as to the effectiveness of the approaches but the reach and accessibility is proving to be more and more appealing. Liberal arts colleges in the United States like New England College, Wesleyan University, and Bryn Mawr College are now offering complete online degrees in many business curricula despite the controversy that surrounds the learning method.\nThere are also several business schools which still rely on the lecture method to give students a basic business education. Lectures are generally given from the professor's point of view, and rarely require interaction from the students unless notetaking is required. Lecture as a method of teaching in business schools has been criticized by experts for reducing the incentive and individualism in the learning experience.\nExecutive education.\nIn addition to teaching students, many business schools run Executive Education programs. These may be either open programs or company-specific programs. Executives may also acquire an MBA title in an Executive MBA program within university of business or from top ranked business schools. Many business schools seek close co-operation with business.\nAccreditation.\nThere are three main accreditation agencies for business schools in the United States: ACBSP, AACSB, and the IACBE. In Europe, the EQUIS business school accreditation system is run by the EFMD, which sometimes applies the more narrow EPAS label to specific courses. The AMBA accredits MBA programmes and other post-graduate business programmes in 75 countries; its sister organisation the Business Graduates Association (BGA), accredits business schools, based on the impact they make on students, employers and the wider community and society, in terms of ethics and responsible management practices. Triple accreditation is used to indicate that a school has been accredited by these three bodies: AACSB, AMBA, and EQUIS. About 1% of business schools are triple-accredited.\nGlobal business school and MBA rankings.\nEach year, organizations and publications such as \"Bloomberg Businessweek\" (US), \"Corporate Knights\" (Canada), Eduniversal (France), \"Financial Times\" (UK) and Quacquarelli Symonds (UK) publish rankings of business schools and MBA programs that, while sometimes controversial in their methodologies, nevertheless can directly influence the prestige of schools that achieve high scores. Academic research is also considered to be an important feature and popular way to gauge the prestige of business schools. Business schools share the common purpose of developing global managerial talent and to this end, business schools are encouraged to accelerate global engagement strategies on the foundations of collaboration and innovation.\nTuition.\nIn Europe, a bachelor's degree is tuition-free at public intuitions in several countries: Austria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Greece, Malta, Montenegro, Norway, Poland, Scotland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Turkey. In the German education system, most universities do not charge tuition, except for some executive MBA programs. French tuition fees are capped based on the level of education pursued, from \u20ac183 (US $) per year for undergraduate and up to \u20ac388 (US$) for doctorates. Tuition fees in the United Kingdom were introduced in 1998 and are \u00a39,250 annually for undergraduate courses for home students in England, with higher fees for students who are not domiciled in the UK. Postgraduate courses in the UK often have higher fees, and many universities charge a premium rate for MBAs. All private and autonomous institutions in Europe charge tuition.\nIn the United States, most public college and universities charge tuition. According to the CollegeBoard, the average cost for an out-of-state, or international student, to attend a public four year university in 2020 was $38,330 (\u20ac), while the average in-state cost was $21,950 (\u20ac). Two year public universities, such as a community colleges, charge $3,730 (\u20ac) on average for in-state students, but these institutions usually do not offer Bachelors or MBA degrees. Private institutions in the United States all charge tuition, often considerably more than their public counterparts.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is tied for first in PGA Tour wins, ranks second in men's major championships, and holds numerous golf records. Woods is widely regarded as one of the greatest golfers of all time and is one of the most famous athletes in modern history. He is an inductee of the World Golf Hall of Fame.\nFollowing an outstanding junior, college, and amateur golf career, Woods turned professional in 1996 at the age of 20. By the end of April 1997, he had won three PGA Tour events in addition to his first major, the 1997 Masters, which he won by 12 strokes in a record-breaking performance. He reached number one in the Official World Golf Ranking for the first time in June 1997, less than a year after turning pro. Throughout the first decade of the 21st century, Woods was the dominant force in golf. He was the top-ranked golfer in the world from August 1999 to September 2004 (264 consecutive weeks) and again from June 2005 to October 2010 (281 consecutive weeks). During this time, he won 13 of golf's major championships (including 7 of the 11 contested from August 1999 to June 2002) and was named AP Athlete of the Decade.\nThe next decade of Woods's career was marked by comebacks from personal problems and injuries. He took a self-imposed hiatus from professional golf from December 2009 to early April 2010 in an attempt to resolve marital issues with his wife at the time, Elin. Woods admitted to multiple marital infidelities, and the couple eventually divorced. He fell to number 58 in the world rankings in November 2011 before ascending again to the number-one ranking between March 2013 and May 2014. However, injuries led him to undergo four back surgeries between 2014 and 2017. Woods competed in only one tournament between August 2015 and January 2018, and he dropped off the list of the world's top 1,000 golfers. On his return to regular competition, Woods made steady progress to the top of the game, winning his first tournament in five years at the Tour Championship in September 2018 and his first major in 11 years at the 2019 Masters.\nWoods has held numerous golf records. He has been the number one player in the world for the most consecutive weeks and for the greatest total number of weeks of any golfer in history. He has been awarded PGA Player of the Year a record 11 times and has won the Byron Nelson Award for lowest adjusted scoring average a record eight times. Woods has the record of leading the money list in ten different seasons. He has won 15 professional major golf championships (trailing only Jack Nicklaus, who leads with 18) and 82 PGA Tour events (tied for first all time with Sam Snead). Woods leads all active golfers in career major wins and career PGA Tour wins.\nWoods is the fifth of six (after Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus, and followed by Rory McIlroy) players to achieve the career Grand Slam, and the youngest to do so. He is also the second golfer out of two (after Nicklaus) to achieve a career Grand Slam three times.\nWoods has won 18 World Golf Championships. He was also part of the American winning team for the 1999 Ryder Cup. In May 2019, Woods was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Trump, the fourth golfer to receive the honor.\nOn February 23, 2021, Woods was hospitalized in serious but stable condition after a single-car collision and underwent emergency surgery to repair compound fractures sustained in his right leg in addition to a shattered ankle. In an interview with \"Golf Digest\" in November 2021, Woods indicated that his full-time career as a professional golfer was over, although he would continue to play \"a few events per year\". For the first time since the car crash, he returned to the PGA Tour at the 2022 Masters. As of June 2025, his net worth is estimated at US$ 1.3 billion, according to \"Forbes\".\nBackground and family.\nWoods was born on December 30, 1975, in Cypress, California, to Earl and Kultida \"Tida\" Woods. He is their only child, though he has two half-brothers and a half-sister from his father's first marriage. Earl was a retired U.S. Army officer and Vietnam War veteran. Earl was born to African-American parents and was also said to be of European and Native American descent. Kultida (n\u00e9e Punsawad) is originally from Thailand, where Earl met her when he was on a tour of duty there in 1968. She is of mixed Thai, Chinese, and Dutch ancestry. In 2002, ESPN claimed: \"For the record, he is one-quarter Thai, one-quarter Chinese, one-quarter Caucasian, one-eighth African American and one-eighth Native American.\" Tiger has described his ethnic make-up as \"\"Cablinasian\"\" (a syllabic abbreviation he coined from Caucasian, Black, American Indian, and Asian).\nWoods's first name, Eldrick, was chosen by his mother because it began with \"E\" (for Earl) and ended with \"K\" (for Kultida). His middle name Tont is a traditional Thai name. He was nicknamed Tiger in honor of his father's friend, South Vietnamese Colonel Vuong Dang Phong, who had also been known as Tiger. Woods has a niece, Cheyenne Woods, who played for the Wake Forest University golf team and turned professional in 2012 when she made her pro debut in the LPGA Championship.\nEarl Woods died on May 3, 2006. Kultida Woods died on February 4, 2025. Woods paid tribute to his mother after her death, saying \"without her none of my personal achievements would have been possible.\"\nEarly life and amateur golf career.\nWoods grew up in Orange County, California. He was a child prodigy who was introduced to golf before the age of two by his athletic father Earl Woods. Earl was a single-digit handicap amateur golfer who also was one of the earliest African-American college baseball players at Kansas State University. Woods told reporters he had wanted to be a baseball player like his father but abandoned that goal after tearing his rotator cuff. His father was a member of the military and had playing privileges at the Navy golf course beside the Joint Forces Training Base in Los Alamitos, which allowed Tiger to play there. Tiger also played at the par 3 Heartwell golf course in Long Beach, as well as some of the municipals in Long Beach.\nIn 1978, Woods putted against comedian Bob Hope in a television appearance on \"The Mike Douglas Show\". At age three, he shot a 48 over nine holes at the Navy course. At age five, he appeared in \"Golf Digest\" and on ABC's \"That's Incredible!\" Before turning seven, Woods won the Under Age 10 section of the Drive, Pitch, and Putt competition, held at the Navy Golf Course in Cypress. In 1984 at the age of eight, he won the 9\u201310 boys' event, the youngest age group available, at the Junior World Golf Championships. He first broke 80 at age eight. He went on to win the Junior World Championships six times, including four consecutive wins from 1988 to 1991. Woods's father Earl wrote that Tiger first defeated him at the age of 11 years, with Earl trying his best. He lost to Woods every time from then on. Woods first broke 70 on a regulation golf course at age 12.\nWhen Woods was 13 years old, he played in the 1989 Big I, which was his first major national junior tournament. In the final round, he was paired with pro John Daly, who was then relatively unknown. The event's format placed a professional with each group of juniors who had qualified. Daly birdied three of the last four holes to beat him by only one stroke. As a young teenager, Woods first met Jack Nicklaus in Los Angeles at the Bel-Air Country Club, when Nicklaus was performing a clinic for the club's members. Woods was part of the show, and he impressed Nicklaus and the crowd with his skills and potential. Earl Woods had researched in detail the records and accomplishments of Nicklaus and had set his young son the goals of breaking those records.\nWoods was 15 years old and a student at Western High School in Anaheim when he became the youngest U.S. Junior Amateur champion; this was a record that stood until it was broken by Jim Liu in 2010. He was named 1991's Southern California Amateur Player of the Year (for the second consecutive year) and Golf Digest Junior Amateur Player of the Year. In 1992, he defended his title at the U.S. Junior Amateur Championship, becoming the tournament's first two-time winner. He also competed in his first PGA Tour event, the Nissan Los Angeles Open (he missed the 36-hole cut), and was named Golf Digest Amateur Player of the Year, Golf World Player of the Year, and Golfweek National Amateur of the Year.\nThe following year, Woods won his third consecutive U.S. Junior Amateur; he remains the event's only three-time winner. In 1994, at the TPC at Sawgrass in Florida, he became the youngest winner of the U.S. Amateur, a record he held until 2008 when it was broken by Danny Lee. He was a member of the American team at the 1994 Eisenhower Trophy World Amateur Golf Team Championships (winning), and the 1995 Walker Cup (losing).\nWoods graduated from Western High School at age 18 in 1994 and was voted \"Most Likely to Succeed\" among the graduating class. He starred for the high school's golf team under coach Don Crosby. Woods learned to manage his stuttering as a boy. This was not widely known until he wrote a letter to a boy who contemplated suicide. Woods wrote, \"I know what it's like to be different and to sometimes not fit in. I also stuttered as a child and I would talk to my dog and he would sit there and listen until he fell asleep. I also took a class for two years to help me, and I finally learned to stop.\"\nCollege golf career.\nWoods was heavily recruited by college golf powers and chose Stanford University, the reigning NCAA champions. He enrolled at Stanford in the fall of 1994 under a golf scholarship and won his first collegiate event, the 40th Annual William H. Tucker Invitational, that September. He selected a major in economics and was nicknamed \"Urkel\" by college teammate Notah Begay III. In 1995, he successfully defended his U.S. Amateur title at the Newport Country Club in Rhode Island and was voted Pac-10 Player of the Year, NCAA First Team All-American, and Stanford's Male Freshman of the Year (an award that encompasses all sports).\nAt age 19, Woods participated in his first PGA Tour major, the 1995 Masters, and tied for 41st as the only amateur to make the cut. At age 20 in 1996, he became the first golfer to win three consecutive U.S. Amateur titles and won the NCAA individual golf championship. In winning the silver medal as leading amateur at The Open Championship, he tied the record for an amateur aggregate score of 281. He left college after two years in order to turn professional in the golf industry. In 1996, Woods moved out of California, stating in 2013 that it was due to the state's high tax rate.\nProfessional career.\nWoods turned professional at age 20 in August 1996 and immediately signed advertising deals with Nike, Inc. and Titleist that ranked as the most lucrative endorsement contracts in golf history at that time. Woods was named \"Sports Illustrated\"'s 1996 Sportsman of the Year and PGA Tour Rookie of the Year. On April 13, 1997, he won his first major, the Masters, in record-breaking fashion and became the tournament's youngest winner at age 21. Two months later, he set the record for the fastest ascent to No. 1 in the Official World Golf Ranking. After a lackluster 1998, Woods finished the 1999 season with eight wins, including the PGA Championship, a feat not achieved since Johnny Miller did it in 1974.\nWoods was severely myopic; his eyesight had a rating of 11 diopters. In order to correct this problem, he underwent successful laser eye surgery in 1999, and he immediately resumed winning tour events. In 2007, his vision again began to deteriorate, and he underwent laser eye surgery a second time. In 2000, Woods won six consecutive events on the PGA Tour, which was the longest winning streak since Ben Hogan did it in 1948. One of these was the U.S. Open, where he broke or tied nine tournament records in what \"Sports Illustrated\" called \"the greatest performance in golf history\", in which Woods won the tournament by a record 15-stroke margin and earned a check for $800,000. At age 24, he became the youngest golfer to achieve the Career Grand Slam. At the end of 2000, Woods had won nine of the twenty PGA Tour events he entered and had broken the record for lowest scoring average in tour history. He was named the \"Sports Illustrated\" Sportsman of the Year, the only athlete to be honored twice, and was ranked by Golf Digest magazine as the twelfth-best golfer of all time.\nWhen Woods won the 2001 Masters, he became the only player to win four consecutive major professional golf titles, although not in the same calendar year. This achievement came to be known as the \"Tiger Slam\". Following a stellar 2001 and 2002 in which he continued to dominate the tour, Woods's career hit a slump. He did not win a major in 2003 or 2004. In September 2004, Vijay Singh overtook Woods in the Official World Golf Rankings, ending Woods's record streak of 264 weeks at No. 1.\nWoods rebounded in 2005, winning six PGA Tour events and reclaiming the top spot in July after swapping it back and forth with Singh over the first half of the year.\nWoods began dominantly in 2006, winning his first two PGA tournaments but failing to capture his fifth Masters championship in April. Following the death of his father in May, Woods took some time off from the tour and appeared rusty upon his return at the U.S. Open at Winged Foot Golf Club, where he missed the cut. However, he quickly returned to form and ended the year by winning six consecutive tour events. At the season's close, Woods had 54 total wins that included 12 majors; he broke the tour records for both total wins and total majors wins over eleven seasons.\nWoods continued to excel in 2007 and the first part of 2008. In April 2008, he underwent knee surgery and missed the next two months on the tour. Woods returned for the 2008 U.S. Open, where he struggled the first day but ultimately claimed a dramatic sudden death victory over Rocco Mediate that followed an 18-hole playoff, after which Mediate said, \"This guy does things that are just not normal by any stretch of the imagination,\" and Kenny Perry added, \"He beat everybody on one leg.\" Two days later, Woods announced that he would miss the remainder of the season due to additional knee surgery, and that his knee was more severely damaged than previously revealed, prompting even greater praise for his U.S. Open performance. Woods called it \"my greatest ever championship.\" In Woods's absence, television ratings for the remainder of the season suffered a huge decline from 2007.\nWoods had a much anticipated return to golf in 2009, when he performed well. His comeback included a spectacular performance at the 2009 Presidents Cup, but he failed to win a major, the first year since 2004 that he did not do so. After his marital infidelities came to light and received massive media coverage at the end of 2009 (see further details below), Woods announced in December that he would be taking an indefinite break from competitive golf. In February 2010, he delivered a televised apology for his behavior, saying \"I was wrong and I was foolish.\" During this period, several companies ended their endorsement deals with Woods.\nWoods returned to competition in April at the 2010 Masters, where he finished tied for fourth place. He followed the Masters with poor showings at the Quail Hollow Championship and the Players Championship, where he withdrew in the fourth round, citing injury. Shortly afterward, Hank Haney, Woods's coach since 2003, resigned the position. In August, Woods hired Sean Foley as Haney's replacement. The rest of the season went badly for Woods, who failed to win a single event for the first time since turning professional, while nevertheless finishing the season ranked No. 2 in the world.\nIn 2011, Woods's performance continued to suffer; this took its toll on his ranking. After falling to No. 7 in March, he rebounded to No. 5 with a strong showing at the 2011 Masters, where he tied for fourth place. Due to leg injuries incurred at the Masters, he missed several summer stops on the PGA Tour. In July, he fired his longtime caddie Steve Williams (who was shocked by the dismissal), and replaced him on an interim basis with friend Bryon Bell until he hired Joe LaCava. After returning to tournament play in August, Woods continued to falter, and his ranking gradually fell to a low of #58. He rose to No. 50 in mid-November after a third-place finish at the Emirates Australian Open, and broke his winless streak with a victory at December's Chevron World Challenge.\nWoods began his 2012 season with two tournaments (the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship and the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am) where he started off well but struggled on the final rounds. Following the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship, where he was knocked out in the second round by missing a 5-foot putt, Woods revised his putting technique and tied for second at The Honda Classic, with the lowest final-round score in his PGA Tour career. After a short time off due to another leg injury, Woods won the Arnold Palmer Invitational, his first win on the PGA Tour since the BMW Championship in September 2009. Following several dismal performances, Woods notched his 73rd PGA Tour win at the Memorial Tournament in June, tying Jack Nicklaus in second place for most PGA Tour victories; a month later, Woods surpassed Nicklaus with a win at the AT&amp;T National, to trail only Sam Snead, who accumulated 82 PGA tour wins.\nThe year 2013 brought a return of Woods's dominating play. In January, he won the Farmers Insurance Open by four shots for his 75th PGA Tour win. It was the seventh time he won the event. In March, he won the WGC-Cadillac Championship, also for the seventh time, giving him his 17th WGC title and first since 2009. Two weeks later, he won the Arnold Palmer Invitational, winning the event for a record-tying 8th time. The win moved him back to the top of the world rankings. To commemorate that achievement, Nike was quick to launch an ad with the tagline \"winning takes care of everything\".\nDuring the 2013 Masters, Woods faced disqualification after unwittingly admitting in a post-round interview with ESPN that he took an illegal drop on the par-5 15th hole when his third shot bounced off the pin and into the water. After further review of television footage, Woods was assessed a two-stroke penalty for the drop but was not disqualified. He finished tied for fourth in the event. Woods won The Players Championship in May 2013, his second career win at the event, notching his fourth win of the 2013 season. It was the quickest he got to four wins in any season of his professional career.\nWoods had a poor showing at the 2013 U.S. Open as a result of an elbow injury that he sustained at The Players Championship. In finishing at 13-over-par, he recorded his worst score as a professional and finished 12 strokes behind winner Justin Rose. After a prolonged break because of the injury, during which he missed the Greenbrier Classic and his own AT&amp;T National, he returned at the Open Championship at Muirfield. Despite being in contention all week and beginning the final round only two strokes behind Lee Westwood, he struggled with the speed of the greens and could only manage a 3-over-par 74 that left him tied for 6th place, five strokes behind eventual winner Phil Mickelson. Two weeks later, Woods returned to form at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, recording his 5th win of the season and 8th win at the event in its 15-year history. His second-round 61 matched his record score on the PGA Tour and could easily have been a 59 were it not for some short missed birdie putts on the closing holes. This gave him a seven-stroke lead that he held onto for the rest of the tournament. But at the PGA Championship at Oak Hill Country Club, Woods never was in contention, making 2013 his fifth full season where he did not win a major; he was in contention in only two of the four majors in 2013.\nAfter a slow start to 2014, Woods sustained an injury during the final round of The Honda Classic and was unable to finish the tournament. He withdrew after the 13th hole, citing back pain. He subsequently competed in the WGC-Cadillac Championship but was visibly in pain during much of the last round. He was forced to skip the Arnold Palmer Invitational at the end of March 2014, and after undergoing back surgery, he announced on April 1 that he would miss the Masters for the first time since 1994. Woods returned at the Quicken Loans National in June, however he said that his expectations for the week were low. He struggled with nearly every aspect of his game and missed the cut. He next played at The Open Championship, contested at Hoylake, where Woods had won eight years prior. Woods fired a brilliant 69 in the first round to put himself in contention, but shot 77 on Friday and eventually finished 69th. Despite his back pain, he played at the 2014 PGA Championship where he failed to make the cut. On August 25, 2014, Woods and his swing coach Sean Foley parted ways. In the four years under Foley, he won eight times but no majors. He had previously won eight majors with Harmon and six with Haney. Woods said there was currently no timetable to find a replacement swing coach.\nOn February 5, 2015, Woods withdrew from the Farmers Insurance Open after another back injury. Woods stated on his website that it was unrelated to his previous surgery and he would take a break from golf until his back healed. He returned for the Masters, finishing in a tie for 17th. In the final round, Woods injured his wrist after his club hit a tree root. He later stated that a bone popped out of his wrist, but he adjusted it back into place and finished the round. Woods then missed the cut at the 2015 U.S. Open and Open Championship, the first time Woods missed the cut at consecutive majors, finishing near the bottom of the leaderboard both times. He finished tied for 18th at the Quicken Loans National on August 2. In late August 2015, Woods played quite well at the Wyndham Championship finishing the tournament at 13-under, only four strokes behind the winner, and tied for 10th place. Woods offered only a brief comment on the speculation that he was still recovering from back surgery, saying it was \"just my hip\" but offering no specifics.\nWoods had back surgery on September 16, 2015. In late March 2016, he announced that he would miss the Masters while he recovered from the surgery; he had also missed the 2014 Masters due to a back problem. \"I'm absolutely making progress, and I'm really happy with how far I've come,\" he explained in a statement. \"But I still have no timetable to return to competitive golf.\" However, he did attend the Masters Champions Dinner on April 5, 2016. For the first time in his career, he missed all four majors in one year due to problems with his back. In October 2016, he told Charlie Rose on PBS that he still wanted to break Jack Nicklaus's record of 18 major titles. Woods underwent back surgery in December 2016 and spent the next 15 months off the Tour. He made his return to competitive golf in the Hero World Challenge.\nWoods's back problems continued to hinder him in 2017. He missed the cut at the Farmers Insurance Open in January and pulled out of a European Tour event in Dubai on February 3. On March 31, Woods announced on his website that he would not be playing in the 2017 Masters Tournament despite being cleared to play by his doctors. Woods said that although he was happy with his rehabilitation, he did not feel \"tournament ready.\" Woods subsequently told friends, \"I'm done\". On April 20, Woods announced that he had undergone his fourth back surgery since 2014 to alleviate back and leg pain. Recovery time required up to six months, meaning that Woods would spend the rest of the year without playing any professional golf. Woods returned to competitive golf at the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas. He shot rounds of 69\u201368\u201375\u201368 and finished tied for 9th place. His world ranking went from 1,199th to 668th, which was the biggest jump in the world rankings in his career.\nOn March 11, 2018, he finished one-shot back and tied for second at the Valspar Championship in Florida, his first top-five finish on the PGA Tour since 2013. He then tied for sixth with a score of five under par at the 2018 Open Championship. At the last major of the year, the 2018 PGA Championship, Woods finished second, two shots behind the winner Brooks Koepka. It was his best result in a major since 2009 (second at the 2009 PGA Championship) and moved him up to 26th in the world rankings. His final round of 64 was his best-ever final round in a major.\nWoods returned to the winner's circle for the 80th time in his PGA Tour career on September 23, 2018, when he won the season-ending Tour Championship at East Lake Golf Club for the second time and that tournament for the third time. He shot rounds of 65\u201368\u201365\u201371 to win by two strokes over Billy Horschel.\nOn April 14, 2019, Woods won the Masters, which was his first major championship win in eleven years and his 15th major overall. He finished 13 under par to win by one stroke over Dustin Johnson, Xander Schauffele and Brooks Koepka. At age 43, he became the second oldest golfer ever to win the Masters, after Jack Nicklaus who was 46 when he triumphed in 1986. In August 2019, Woods announced via social media that he underwent knee surgery to repair minor cartilage damage and that he had an arthroscopic procedure during the Tour Championship. In his statement, Woods also confirmed that he was walking and intends on traveling and playing in Japan in October.\nWoods played in his first 2020 PGA Tour event at the Zozo Championship in October 2019, which was the first-ever PGA Tour event played in Japan. Woods, who played a highly publicized skins game earlier in the week at the same course as the Championship, held at least a share of the lead after every round of the rain-delayed tournament, giving him a three stroke victory over Hideki Matsuyama. The win was Woods's 82nd on Tour, tying him with Sam Snead for the most victories all time on the PGA Tour.\nIn December 2020, Woods had microdiscectomy surgery on his back for the fifth time. The operation was to remove a pressurized disc fragment that was pinching his nerve and causing him pain during the PNC Championship. Woods returned to play in his first professional tournament since his 2021 motor vehicle crash at the 2022 Masters Tournament. He made the cut and finished in 47th place at 13-over par, 23 shots behind the winner Scottie Scheffler.\nIn August 2022, Woods, Rory McIlroy, Mike McCarley, and the PGA Tour announced the formation of TGL, a six-team virtual golfing league. In November 2023, Woods revealed himself as an co-owner and player for Jupiter Links Golf Club, founded with investments by David Blitzer.\nHonors.\nOn August 20, 2007, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and his wife Maria Shriver announced that Woods would be inducted into the California Hall of Fame. He was inducted December 5, 2007 at The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts in Sacramento. In May 2019, following his 2019 Masters Tournament win, Woods was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Donald Trump.\nIn 2000 and 2001, Woods was named the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year, becoming the inaugural recipient of the award. In 2000 he received the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year, an award given to a non-British sportsperson considered to have made the most substantial contribution to a sport. Domestically, Woods has also been recognized by U.S. publications. He was named Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year a record-tying four times, was named \"Athlete of the Decade\" by the Associated Press in 2009, and is one of only two people to be named \"Sports Illustrated\"'s Sportsman of the Year more than once.\nSince his record-breaking win at the 1997 Masters, Woods has been the biggest name in golf and his presence in tournaments has drawn a huge fan following. Some sources have credited him for dramatically increasing prize money in golf, generating interest in new PGA tournament audiences, and for drawing the largest TV ratings in golf history. His recognition as one of the most famous athletes in modern history includes being depicted in a wax sculpture at Madame Tussauds.\nEndorsements.\nDuring the first decade of his professional career, Woods was the world's most marketable athlete. Shortly after his 21st birthday in 1996, he signed endorsement deals with numerous companies, including General Motors, Titleist, General Mills, American Express, Accenture, and Nike. In 2000, he signed a 5-year, $105\u00a0million contract extension with Nike, which was the largest endorsement package signed by a professional athlete at that time. Woods's endorsement has been credited with playing a significant role in taking the Nike Golf brand from a \"start-up\" golf company earlier in the previous decade to becoming the leading golf apparel company in the world and a major player in the equipment and golf ball market. Nike Golf is one of the fastest growing brands in the sport, with an estimated $600\u00a0million in sales. Woods has been described as the \"ultimate endorser\" for Nike Golf, frequently seen wearing Nike gear during tournaments, and even in advertisements for other products. Woods receives a percentage from the sales of Nike Golf apparel, footwear, golf equipment, golf balls, and has a building named after him at Nike's headquarters campus in Beaverton, Oregon.\nIn 2002, Woods was involved in every aspect of the launch of Buick's Rendezvous SUV. A company spokesman stated that Buick was happy with the value of Woods's endorsement, pointing out that more than 130,000 Rendezvous vehicles were sold in 2002 and 2003. \"That exceeded our forecasts,\" he was quoted as saying, \"It has to be in recognition of Tiger.\" In February 2004, Buick renewed Woods's endorsement contract for another five years, in a deal reportedly worth $40\u00a0million.\nWoods collaborated closely with TAG Heuer to develop the world's first professional golf watch, which was released in April 2005. The lightweight, titanium-construction watch, incorporates features to facilitate wearing the watch while playing the game. It is capable of absorbing up to 5,000 Gs of shock, far in excess of the forces generated by a normal golf swing. In 2006, the TAG Heuer \"Professional Golf Watch\" won the prestigious \"iF product design award\" in the Leisure/Lifestyle category.\nWoods also endorsed the Tiger Woods PGA Tour series of video games; he has done so since 1999. In 2006, he signed a six-year contract with Electronic Arts, the series' publisher.\nIn February 2007, Woods, Roger Federer, and Thierry Henry became ambassadors for the \"Gillette Champions\" marketing campaign. Gillette did not disclose financial terms, though an expert estimated the deal could total between $10\u00a0million and $20\u00a0million.\nIn October 2007, Gatorade announced that Woods would have his own brand of sports drink starting in March 2008. \"Gatorade Tiger\" was his first U.S. deal with a beverage company and his first licensing agreement. Although no figures were officially disclosed, \"Golfweek\" magazine reported that it was for five years and could pay him as much as $100\u00a0million. The company decided in early fall 2009 to discontinue the drink due to weak sales.\nIn October 2012, it was announced that Woods signed an exclusive endorsement deal with Fuse Science, Inc, a sports nutrition firm.\nIn 1997, Woods and fellow golfer Arnold Palmer initiated a civil case against Bruce Matthews (the owner of Gotta Have It Golf, Inc.) and others in the effort to stop the unauthorized sale of their images and alleged signatures in the memorabilia market. Matthews and associated parties counterclaimed that Woods and his company, ETW Corporation, committed several acts including breach of contract, breach of implied duty of good faith, and violations of Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. Palmer also was named in the counter-suit, accused of violating the same licensing agreement in conjunction with his company Arnold Palmer Enterprises.\nOn March 12, 2014, a Florida jury found in favor of Gotta Have It on its breach of contract and other related claims, rejected ETW's counterclaims, and awarded Gotta Have It $668,346 in damages. The award may end up exceeding $1\u00a0million once interest has been factored in, though the ruling may be appealed.\nIn August 2016, Woods announced that he would be seeking a new golf equipment partner after the news of Nike's exit from the equipment industry. It was announced on January 25, 2017, that he would be signing a new club deal with TaylorMade. He added the 2016 M2 driver along with the 2017 M1 fairway woods, with irons to be custom made at a later date. He also added his Scotty Cameron Newport 2 GSS, a club he used to win 13 of his 15 majors. Also, in late 2016, he would add Monster Energy as his primary bag sponsor, replacing MusclePharm.\nOn January 8, 2024, Woods announced that he would be parting ways with Nike after 27 years, ending one of the most lucrative endorsements any athlete has had.\nAccumulated wealth.\nWoods has appeared on Forbes list of the world's highest-paid athletes. According to \"Golf Digest\", Woods earned $769,440,709 from 1996 to 2007, and the magazine predicted that Woods would pass a billion dollars in earnings by 2010. In 2009, \"Forbes\" confirmed that Woods was indeed the world's first professional athlete to earn over a billion dollars in his career, after accounting for the $10\u00a0million bonus Woods received for the FedEx Cup title. The same year, Forbes estimated his net worth to be $600\u00a0million, making him the second richest person of color in the United States, behind only Oprah Winfrey. In 2015, Woods ranked ninth in Forbes list of the world's highest-paid athletes, being the top among Asian Americans or the fourth among African Americans. As of 2017, Woods was considered to be the highest-paid golfer in the world. In 2022, Woods was the first golfer to have a net worth over one billion dollars, making him one of the richest celebrities.\nTiger-proofing.\nEarly in Woods's career, a small number of golf industry analysts expressed concern about his impact on the competitiveness of the game and the public appeal of professional golf. Sportswriter Bill Lyon of Knight Ridder asked in a column, \"Isn't Tiger Woods actually bad for golf?\" (though Lyon ultimately concluded that he was not). At first, some pundits feared that Woods would drive the spirit of competition out of the game of golf by making existing courses obsolete and relegating opponents to simply competing for second place each week.\nA related effect was measured by University of California economist Jennifer Brown, who found that other golfers scored worse when competing against Woods than when he was not in the tournament. The scores of highly skilled golfers are nearly one stroke higher when playing against Woods. This effect was larger when he was on winning streaks and disappeared during his well-publicized slump in 2003\u201304. Brown explains the results by noting that competitors of similar skill can hope to win by increasing their level of effort, but that, when facing a \"superstar\" competitor, extra exertion does not significantly raise one's level of winning while increasing risk of injury or exhaustion, leading to reduced effort. Many courses in the PGA Tour rotation (including major championship sites like Augusta National) have added yardage to their tees in an effort to reduce the advantage of long hitters like Woods, in a strategy that became known as \"Tiger-proofing\". Woods said he welcomed the change, in that adding yardage to courses did not affect his ability to win.\nCareer achievements.\nWoods has won 82 official PGA Tour events, including 15 majors. He is 14\u20131 when going into the final round of a major with at least a share of the lead. Multiple golf experts have heralded Woods as \"the greatest closer in history\". He has the lowest career scoring average and the largest career earnings of any player in PGA Tour history.\nWoods's victory at the 2013 Players Championship also marked a win in his 300th PGA Tour start. He also won golf tournaments in his 100th (in 2000) and 200th (in 2006) tour starts.\nWoods has spent the most consecutive and cumulative weeks atop the world rankings. He is one of six players (along with Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus, and Rory McIlroy) to have won all four major championships in his career, known as the Career Grand Slam, and was the youngest to do so. Woods is the only player to have consecutively won all four major championships open to professionals, accomplishing the feat in the 2000\u20132001 seasons.\nMajor championships.\nWins (15).\n1Defeated May in three-hole playoff by 1 stroke: Woods (3\u20134\u20135=12), May (4\u20134\u20135=13) \n2Defeated DiMarco in a sudden-death playoff: Woods (3), DiMarco (4).\n3Defeated Mediate with a par on 1st sudden death hole after 18-hole playoff was tied at even par.

He insisted upon the use of True Temper Dynamic Gold steel-shafted clubs and smaller steel clubheads that promoted accuracy over distance. Many opponents caught up to him, and Phil Mickelson even made a joke in 2003 about Woods using \"inferior equipment\", which did not sit well with Nike, Titleist, or Woods. During 2004, Woods finally upgraded his driver technology to a larger clubhead and graphite shaft, which, coupled with his clubhead speed, again made him one of the tour's longest players off the tee.\nDespite his power advantage, Woods has always focused on developing an excellent all-around game. Although in recent years he has typically been near the bottom of the Tour rankings in driving accuracy, his iron play is generally accurate, his recovery and bunker play is very strong, and his putting (especially under pressure) is possibly his greatest asset. He is largely responsible for a shift to higher standards of athleticism amongst professional golfers, and is known for utilizing more hours of practice than most.\nFrom mid-1993 (while he was still an amateur) until 2004, Woods worked almost exclusively with leading swing coach Butch Harmon. From mid-1997, Harmon and Woods fashioned a major redevelopment of Woods's full swing, achieving greater consistency, better distance control, and better kinesiology. The changes began to pay off in 1999. Woods and Harmon eventually parted ways. From March 2004 to 2010, Woods was coached by Hank Haney, who worked on flattening his swing plane. Woods continued to win tournaments with Haney, but his driving accuracy dropped significantly. Haney resigned under questionable circumstances in May 2010 and was replaced by Sean Foley.\nFluff Cowan served as Woods's caddie from the start of his professional career until Woods dismissed him in March 1999. He was replaced by Steve Williams, who became a close friend of Woods and is often credited with helping him with key shots and putts. In June 2011, Woods dismissed Williams after he caddied for Adam Scott in the U.S. Open and replaced him with friend Bryon Bell on an interim basis. Joe LaCava, a former caddie of both Fred Couples and Dustin Johnson, was hired by Woods shortly after and has remained Woods's caddie since then.\nOther ventures.\nTGR Foundation.\nThe TGR Foundation was established in 1996 by Woods and his father Earl as the Tiger Woods Foundation with the primary goal of promoting golf among inner-city children. The foundation has conducted junior golf clinics across the country, and sponsors the Tiger Woods Foundation National Junior Golf Team in the Junior World Golf Championships. As of December 2010, TWF employed approximately 55 people.\nThe foundation operates the Tiger Woods Learning Center, a $50-million, facility in Anaheim, California, providing college-access programs for underserved youth. The TWLC opened in 2006 and features seven classrooms, extensive multi-media facilities and an outdoor golf teaching area. The center has since expanded to four additional campuses: two in Washington, D.C.; one in Philadelphia; and one in Stuart, Florida.\nThe foundation benefits from the annual Chevron World Challenge and AT&amp;T National golf tournaments hosted by Woods. In October 2011, the foundation hosted the first Tiger Woods Invitational at Pebble Beach. Other annual fundraisers have included the concert events Block Party, last held in 2009 in Anaheim, and Tiger Jam, last held in 2011 in Las Vegas after a one-year hiatus.\nTiger Woods Design.\nIn November 2006, Woods announced his intention to begin designing golf courses around the world through a new company, Tiger Woods Design. A month later, he announced that the company's first course would be in Dubai as part of a 25.3-million-square-foot development, The Tiger Woods Dubai. The Al Ruwaya Golf Course was initially expected to finish construction in 2009. As of February 2010, only seven holes had been completed; in April 2011, \"The New York Times\" reported that the project had been shelved permanently. In 2013, the partnership between Tiger Woods Design and Dubai Holding was dissolved.\nTiger Woods Design has taken on two other courses, neither of which has materialized. In August 2007, Woods announced The Cliffs at High Carolina, a private course in the Blue Ridge Mountains near Asheville, North Carolina. After a groundbreaking in November 2008, the project suffered cash flow problems and suspended construction. In 2019, the 800-acre site was sold for $19.3 million and in 2024 550 acres of that were listed for about the same price. While no evidence of Woods's involvement has been found, the listing shows that development plans are still on file. A third course, in Punta Brava, Mexico, was announced in October 2008, but incurred delays due to issues with permits and an environmental impact study. Construction on the Punta Brava course has not yet begun.\nThese projects have encountered problems that have been attributed to factors that include overly optimistic estimates of their value, declines throughout the global economy (particularly the U.S. crash in home prices), and the decreased appeal and marketability of Woods following his 2009 infidelity scandal.\nWritings.\nWoods wrote a golf instruction column for \"Golf Digest\" magazine from 1997 to February 2011. In 2001, he wrote a best-selling golf instruction book, \"How I Play Golf\", which had the largest print run of any golf book for its first edition, 1.5\u00a0million copies. In March 2017, he published a memoir, \"The 1997 Masters: My Story\", co-authored by Lorne Rubenstein, which focuses on his first Masters win. In October 2019, Woods announced he would be writing a memoir book titled \"Back\".\nNFT.\nTiger Woods's \"Iconic Fist Pumps Collection\" is his first digital Non-fungible token (NFT) collection that launched on the DraftKings Marketplace in collaboration with Autograph.io on September 28, 2021. Autograph is an NFT platform that was co-founded by Tom Brady that helped launch NFT projects with some of the biggest names in sports, including Usain Bolt, Rafael Nadal, Wayne Gretzky, and Tony Hawk. Woods's first collection offered 10,000 digital pictures of his iconic moments ranging from $12 to $1,500, and 300 of those NFTs were also accompanied by his official digital signature. The NFTs launched on the Autograph platform grants fans unique access to exclusive content, first dibs on digital collectibles, custom-made merchandise, and access to private in-person events depending on the varying utility of each NFT.\nSun Day Red.\nWoods partnered with TaylorMade to launch his golf apparel line, dubbed \"Sun Day Red\". The line was announced on February 12, 2024, and featured Woods's signature red shirt.\nPersonal life.\nRelationships and children.\nIn November 2003, Woods became engaged to Elin Nordegren, a Swedish former model and daughter of former minister of migration Barbro Holmberg and radio journalist Thomas Nordegren. They were introduced during The Open Championship in 2001 by Swedish golfer Jesper Parnevik, who had employed her as an au pair. They married on October 5, 2004, at the Sandy Lane resort in Barbados, and lived at Isleworth, a community in Windermere, a suburb of Orlando, Florida. In 2006, they purchased a $39-million estate in Jupiter Island, Florida, and began constructing a 10,000-square-foot home; Woods moved there in 2010 following the couple's divorce.\nWoods and Nordegren's first child was a daughter born in 2007, whom they named Sam Alexis Woods. Woods chose the name because his own father had always called him Sam. Their son, Charlie Axel Woods, was born in 2009.\nInfidelity scandal and fallout.\nIn November 2009, the \"National Enquirer\" published a story claiming that Woods had an extramarital affair with New York City nightclub manager Rachel Uchitel, who denied the claim. Two days later, around 2:30\u00a0a.m. on November 27, Woods was driving from his Florida mansion in his Cadillac Escalade SUV when he collided with a fire hydrant, a tree, and several hedges near his home. He was treated for minor facial lacerations and received a ticket for careless driving. Following intense media speculation about the cause of the crash, Woods released a statement on his website and took sole responsibility for the crash, calling it a \"private matter\" and crediting his wife for helping him from the car. On November 30, Woods announced that he would not be appearing at his own charity golf tournament (the Chevron World Challenge) or any other tournaments in 2009 because of his injuries.\nOn December 2, following \"Us Weekly\" magazine's previous day reporting of a purported mistress and subsequent release of a voicemail message allegedly left by Woods for the woman, Woods released a further statement. He admitted transgressions and apologized to \"all of those who have supported [him] over the years\", while reiterating his and his family's right to privacy. Over the next few days, more than a dozen women claimed in various media outlets to have had affairs with Woods. On December 11, he released a third statement admitting to infidelity and he apologized again. He also announced that he would be taking \"an indefinite break from professional golf.\"\nIn the days and months following Woods's admission of multiple infidelities, several companies re-evaluated their relationships with him. Accenture, AT&amp;T, Gatorade, and General Motors completely ended their sponsorship deals, while Gillette suspended advertising featuring Woods. TAG Heuer dropped Woods from advertising in December 2009 and officially ended their deal when his contract expired in August 2011. \"Golf Digest\" magazine suspended Woods's monthly column beginning with the February 2010 issue. In contrast, Nike continued to support Woods, as did Electronic Arts, which was working with Woods on the game \"Tiger Woods PGA Tour Online\". A December 2009 study estimated the shareholder loss caused by Woods's affairs to be between $5\u00a0billion and $12\u00a0billion.\nOn February 19, 2010, Woods gave a televised statement in which he said he went through a 45-day therapy program that began at the end of December. He again apologized for his actions. \"I thought I could get away with whatever I wanted to\", he said. \"I felt that I had worked hard my entire life and deserved to enjoy all the temptations around me. I felt I was entitled. Thanks to money and fame, I didn't have to go far to find them. I was wrong. I was foolish.\" He said he did not know yet when he would be returning to golf. On March 16, he announced that he would play in the 2010 Masters.\nAfter six years of marriage, Woods and Nordegren divorced on August 23, 2010.\nSubsequent relationships.\nOn March 18, 2013, Woods announced that he and Olympic gold medal skier Lindsey Vonn were dating. They split up in May 2015. From November 2016 to August 2017, Woods was rumored to be in a relationship with stylist Kristin Smith. Between late 2017 and late 2022, Woods began dating restaurant manager Erica Herman. However they split up and, in early 2023, Herman filed suit against Woods for compensaton. She later dropped the suit after a Florida judge ruled in favor of Woods. On March 23, 2025, he confirmed his current relationship with Vanessa Trump.\n2017 DUI arrest.\nOn May 29, 2017, Woods was arrested near his home in Jupiter Island, Florida, by the Jupiter Police Department at about 3:00\u00a0am. EDT for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. He was asleep in his car, which was stationary in a traffic lane with its engine running. He later stated that he took prescription drugs and did not realize how they might interact together. On July 3, 2017, Woods tweeted that he completed an out-of-state intensive program to tackle an unspecified issue. At his arraignment on August 9, 2017, Woods had his attorney Douglas Duncan submit a not guilty plea for him and agreed to take part in a first-time driving under the influence offender program and attend another arraignment on October 25.\nAt a hearing on October 27, 2017, Woods pleaded guilty to reckless driving. He received a year of probation, was fined $250, and ordered to undergo 50 hours of community service along with regular drug tests. He was not allowed to drink alcohol during the probation, and if he violated the probation he would be sentenced to 90 days in jail with an additional $500 fine.\n2021 car crash.\nOn February 23, 2021, Woods survived a serious rollover car crash in Rancho Palos Verdes, California. The wreck was a single-vehicle collision and Woods was the sole occupant of the vehicle, which was traveling north along Hawthorne Boulevard.\nHe was taken to the Harbor\u2013UCLA Medical Center by ambulance. The incident was under investigation by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, which said the car \"sustained major damage\", and that Woods was driving over , nearly twice the speed limit, before he crashed. No charges were filed. Woods's agent later said that he sustained multiple leg injuries and had surgery for non-life-threatening injuries.\nOther pursuits.\nWoods was raised as a Buddhist. He actively practiced his faith from childhood until well into his adult professional golf career. In a 2000 article, Woods was quoted as saying that he \"believes in Buddhism ... not every aspect, but most of it.\" He has attributed his deviations and infidelity to his losing track of Buddhism. He said, \"Buddhism teaches me to stop following every impulse and to learn restraint. Obviously I lost track of what I was taught.\"\nWoods is registered as an independent voter. In January 2009, Woods delivered a speech commemorating the military at the . In April 2009, Woods visited the White House while promoting the golf tournament he hosts, the AT&amp;T National. In December 2016 and again in November 2017, Woods played golf with President Donald Trump at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach.\nIn popular culture.\nIn January 2021, a two-part documentary series titled \"Tiger\", made by filmmakers Matthew Hamachek and Matthew Heineman, was released by HBO. The film includes interviews with Woods' high school girlfriend, Dina Parr; Steve Williams, his former caddy; a friend called Amber Lauria; and Nick Faldo, among others. The soundtrack includes English punk poet John Cooper Clarke's 1980 poem \"Evidently Chickentown\", which was also used for its ominous sound in an episode of \"The Sopranos\" in 2007.\nIn March 2025, Amazon MGM Studios acquired the film rights to \"The Tiger Slam: The Inside Story of the Greatest Golf Ever Played\" by Kevin Cook. Reinaldo Marcus Green was set to direct the film, which would chronicle Woods's rise from a child prodigy to a dominant figure in professional golf. Barack and Michelle Obama's Higher Ground Productions was in discussions to produce alongside veteran producer Irwin Winkler. The film is expected to focus on Woods's achievement of winning four consecutive major championships, known as the \"Tiger Slam.\" The book presents the story through the perspectives of Woods's caddie, coach, idols, and opponents, offering insight into his career and approach to the game.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nrole=\"presentation\" class=\"wikitable succession-box noprint\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:small;clear:both;\""}
{"id": "43357", "revid": "248739", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43357", "title": "Hokusai", "text": "Japanese artist (1760\u20131849)\n, known mononymously as Hokusai, was a Japanese ukiyo-e artist of the Edo period, active as a painter and printmaker. His woodblock print series \"Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji\" includes the iconic print \"The Great Wave off Kanagawa\". Hokusai was instrumental in developing \"ukiyo-e\" from a style of portraiture largely focused on courtesans and actors into a much broader style of art that focused on landscapes, plants, and animals. His works had a significant influence on Vincent van Gogh and Claude Monet during the wave of Japonisme that spread across Europe in the late 19th century.\nHokusai created the monumental \"Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji\" as a response to a domestic travel boom in Japan and as part of a personal interest in Mount Fuji. It was this series, specifically, \"The Great Wave off Kanagawa\" and \"Fine Wind, Clear Morning\", that secured his fame both in Japan and overseas.\nHokusai was best known for his woodblock ukiyo-e prints, but he worked in a variety of mediums including painting and book illustration. Starting as a young child, he continued working and improving his style until his death, aged 88. In a long and successful career, Hokusai produced over 30,000 paintings, sketches, woodblock prints, and images for picture books. Innovative in his compositions and exceptional in his drawing technique, Hokusai is considered one of the greatest masters in the history of art.\nEarly life.\nHokusai's date of birth is unclear, but is often stated as the 23rd day of the 9th month of the 10th year of the H\u014dreki era (in the old calendar, or 31 October 1760) to an artisan family, in the Katsushika] district of Edo, the capital of the ruling Tokugawa shogunate (currently Katsushika-ku, Tokyo). His childhood name was Tokitar\u014d. It is believed his father was Nakajima Ise, a mirror-maker for the sh\u014dgun. His father never made Hokusai an heir, so it is possible that his mother was a concubine. Hokusai began painting around the age of six, perhaps learning from his father, whose work included the painting of designs around mirrors.\nHokusai was known by at least thirty names during his lifetime. While the use of multiple names was a common practice of Japanese artists of the time, his number of pseudonyms exceeds that of any other major Japanese artist. His name changes are so frequent, and so often related to changes in his artistic production and style, that they are used for breaking his life up into periods.\nAt the age of 12, his father sent him to work in a bookshop and lending library, a popular institution in Japanese cities, where reading books made from woodcut blocks was a popular entertainment of the middle and upper classes. At 14, he worked as an apprentice to a woodcarver, until the age of 18, when he entered the studio of Katsukawa Shunsh\u014d. Shunsh\u014d was an artist of \"ukiyo-e\", a style of woodblock prints and paintings that Hokusai would master, and head of the so-called Katsukawa school. \"Ukiyo-e\", as practised by artists like Shunsh\u014d, focused on images of the courtesans (\"bijin-ga\") and kabuki actors (\"yakusha-e\") who were popular in Japan's cities at the time.\nAfter a year, Hokusai's name changed for the first time, when he was dubbed Shunr\u014d by his master. It was under this name that he published his first prints, a series of pictures of kabuki actors published in 1779. During the decade he worked in Shunsh\u014d's studio, Hokusai was married to his first wife, about whom very little is known except that she died in the early 1790s. He married again in 1797, although this second wife also died after a short time. He fathered two sons and three daughters with these two wives, and his youngest daughter Ei, also known as \u014ci, eventually became an artist and his assistant. \"Fireworks in the Cool of Evening at Ryogoku Bridge in Edo\" (c.\u20091788\u201389) dates from this period of Hokusai's life.\nUpon the death of Shunsh\u014d in 1793, Hokusai began exploring other styles of art, including European styles he was exposed to through French and Dutch copper engravings he was able to acquire. He was soon expelled from the Katsukawa school by Shunk\u014d, the chief disciple of Shunsh\u014d, possibly due to his studies at the rival Kan\u014d school. This event was, in his own words, inspirational: \"What really motivated the development of my artistic style was the embarrassment I suffered at Shunk\u014d's hands\".\nHokusai also changed the subjects of his works, moving away from the images of courtesans and actors that were the traditional subjects of \"ukiyo-e\". Instead, his work became focused on landscapes and images of the daily life of Japanese people from a variety of social levels. This change of subject was a breakthrough in \"ukiyo-e\" and in Hokusai's career.\nMiddle period.\nThe next period saw Hokusai's association with the Tawaraya School and the adoption of the name \"Tawaraya S\u014dri\". He produced many privately commissioned prints for special occasions (\"surimono\"), and illustrations for books of humorous poems (\"ky\u014dka ehon\") during this time. In 1798, Hokusai passed his name on to a pupil and set out as an independent artist, free from ties to a school for the first time, adopting the name Hokusai Tomisa.\nBy 1800, Hokusai was further developing his use of ukiyo-e for purposes other than portraiture. He had also adopted the name he would most widely be known by, Katsushika Hokusai, the former name referring to the part of Edo where he was born, the latter meaning 'north studio', in honour of the North Star, symbol of a deity important in his religion of Nichiren Buddhism. That year, he published two collections of landscapes, \"Famous Sights of the Eastern Capital\" and \"Eight Views of Edo\" (modern Tokyo). He also began to attract students of his own, eventually teaching 50 pupils over the course of his life.\nHe became increasingly famous over the next decade, both due to his artwork and his talent for self-promotion. During an Edo festival in 1804, he created an enormous portrait of the Buddhist prelate Daruma, said to be 200 square meters, using a broom and buckets full of ink. Another story places him in the court of the sh\u014dgun Tokugawa Ienari, invited there to compete with another artist who practised more traditional brushstroke painting. Hokusai painted a blue curve on paper, then chased a chicken whose feet had been dipped in red paint across the image. He described the painting to the sh\u014dgun as a landscape showing the Tatsuta River with red maple leaves floating in it, winning the competition.\nBetween 1804 and 1815, Hokusai collaborated with the popular novelist Takizawa Bakin on a series of illustrated books. Especially popular was the fantasy novel \"Chinsetsu Yumiharizuki\" (\"Strange Tales of the Crescent Moon\", 1807\u20131811) with Minamoto no Tametomo as the main character, and Hokusai gained fame with his creative and powerful illustrations, but the collaboration ended after thirteen works. There are various theories as to why they dissolved their cooperation, such as discordant personalities and conflicting opinions on how to draw illustrations. Hokusai also created several albums of erotic art (\"shunga\"). His most famous image in this genre is \"The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife\", which depicts a young woman entwined sexually with a pair of octopuses, from \"Kinoe no Komatsu\", a three-volume book of shunga from 1814.\nHokusai paid close attention to the production of his work. In letters during his involvement with \"Toshisen Ehon\", a Japanese edition of an anthology of Chinese poetry, Hokusai wrote to the publisher that the blockcutter Egawa Tomekichi, with whom Hokusai had previously worked and whom he respected, had strayed from Hokusai's style in the cutting of certain heads. He also wrote directly to another blockcutter involved in the project, Sugita Kinsuke, stating that he disliked the Utagawa school style in which Kinsuke had cut the figure's eyes and noses and that amendments were needed for the final prints to be true to his style. In his letter, Hokusai included examples of both his style of illustrating eyes and noses and the Utagawa school style.\nIn 1811, at the age of 51, Hokusai changed his name to \"Taito\" and entered the period in which he created the \"Hokusai Manga\" and various \"etehon\", or art manuals. These manuals beginning in 1812 with \"Quick Lessons in Simplified Drawing\", were intended as a convenient way to make money and attract more students. The first volume of \"Manga\" (meaning random drawings) was published in 1814 and was an immediate success. By 1820, he had produced twelve volumes (with three more published posthumously) which include thousands of drawings of objects, plants, animals, religious figures, and everyday people, often with humorous overtones.\nOn 5 October 1817, he painted the \"Great Daruma\" outside the Hongan-ji Nagoya Betsuin in Nagoya. This portrait in ink on paper measured 18 \u00d7 10.8 metres, and the event drew huge crowds. The feat was recounted in a popular song and he received the name \"\"Darusen\"\" or \"Daruma Master\" Although the original was destroyed in 1945, Hokusai's promotional handbills from that time survived and are preserved at the Nagoya City Museum.\nIn 1820, Hokusai changed his name yet again, this time to \"Iitsu\", a change which marked the start of a period in which he secured fame as an artist throughout Japan. His most celebrated work, \"Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji\", including the famous \"The Great Wave off Kanagawa\" and \"Red Fuji\" was produced in the early 1830s. The results of Hokusai's perspectival studies in \"Manga\" can be seen here in \"The Great Wave\" where he uses what would have been seen as a western perspective to represent depth and volume. It proved so popular that ten more prints were later added to the series. Among the other popular series of prints he made during this time are \"A Tour of the Waterfalls of the Provinces\", \"Oceans of Wisdom\" and \"Unusual Views of Celebrated Bridges in the Provinces\". He also began producing a number of detailed individual images of flowers and birds (\"kach\u014d-e\"), including the extraordinarily detailed \"Poppies\" and \"Flock of Chickens\".\nLater life.\nThe next period, beginning in 1834, saw Hokusai working under the name \"Gaky\u014d R\u014djin Manji\" (; \"The Old Man Mad About Art\"). It was at this time that he produced \"One Hundred Views of Mount Fuji\", another significant series, generally considered \"the masterpiece among his landscape picture books\".\nIn the colophon to this work, Hokusai writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;From the age of six, I had a passion for copying the form of things and since the age of fifty I have published many drawings, yet of all I drew by my seventieth year there is nothing worth taking into account. At seventy-three years I partly understood the structure of animals, birds, insects and fishes, and the life of grasses and plants. And so, at eighty-six I shall progress further; at ninety I shall even further penetrate their secret meaning, and by one hundred I shall perhaps truly have reached the level of the marvellous and divine. When I am one hundred and ten, each dot, each line will possess a life of its own.\n\"A True Mirror of Chinese and Japanese Poetry\" (\"Shika shashin kyo\"), produced in about 1833 to 1834, was printed in extra-long vertical formats resembling the form of Chinese hand scrolls. Prints in this series include poems by Chinese and Japanese poets combined with scenes in those countries, and scenes from Noh plays (a form of dance theater predating kabuki). Ten designs in this series survive.\nHokusai's final print series, produced around 1835 to 1836, was called \"One Hundred Poems Explained by a Nurse (Hyakunin isshu tuba ga etoki).\" The series was never published in full, perhaps due to financial hardships faced by Hokusai's publishers during Japan's economic downturn in the mid-1830's. These prints featured scenes with the poems inscribed in a square. Each print also contains the series title listed in its own vertical rectangle.\nIn 1839, a fire destroyed Hokusai's studio and much of his work. By this time, his career was beginning to fade as younger artists such as And\u014d Hiroshige became increasingly popular. At the age of 83, Hokusai traveled to Obuse in Shinano Province (now Nagano Prefecture) at the invitation of a wealthy farmer, Takai Kozan, where he stayed for several years. During his time in Obuse, he created several masterpieces, including the \"Masculine Wave\" and the \"Feminine Wave\". Between 1842 and 1843, in what he described as \"daily exorcisms\" (\"nisshin joma\"), Hokusai painted Chinese lions (\"shishi\") every morning in ink on paper as a talisman against misfortune. Hokusai continued working almost until the end, painting \"The Dragon of Smoke Escaping from Mt Fuji\" and \"Tiger in the Snow\" in early 1849.\nConstantly seeking to produce better work, he apparently exclaimed on his deathbed, \"If only Heaven will give me just another ten years\u00a0... Just another five more years, then I could become a real painter\". He died on 10 May 1849 and was buried at the Seiky\u014d-ji (\u8a93\u6559\u5bfa) in Tokyo (Taito Ward). A haiku he composed shortly before his death reads: \"Though as a ghost, I shall lightly tread, the summer fields\".\nInfluence on art and culture.\nHokusai had achievements in various fields as an artist. He made designs for book illustrations and woodblock prints, sketches, and painting for over 70 years. Hokusai was an early experimenter with western linear perspective among Japanese artists. Hokusai himself was influenced by Sessh\u016b T\u014dy\u014d and other styles of Chinese painting. His influence stretches across the globe to his western contemporaries in nineteenth-century Europe with Japonism, which started with a craze for collecting Japanese art, particularly ukiyo-e. Some of the first samples were to be seen in Paris, when in about 1856, the French printmaker, designer and colleague of many Impressionsist artists such as \u00c9douard Manet, F\u00e9lix Bracquemond first came across a copy of a Hokusai sketchbook at the workshop of August Dalatre, his printer.\nWith the sketchbook as his influence Bracquemond designed the \"Rousseau Service\", an elegant set of dinnerware, on behalf of Francois-Eugene Rousseau, the owner of a glass and ceramics shop. Exhibited at the Universal Exposition in Paris in 1867, the Rousseau Service was a success both critically and commercially and was reissued in several editions over the years. The Rousseau Service featured images of birds and fish copied from the Japanese book illustrations and placed asymmetrically against a white background for a look that would have been very modern at that time.\nHokusai also influenced the Impressionism movement, with themes echoing his work appearing in the work of Claude Monet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir, as well as Art Nouveau, or Jugendstil in Germany. His woodcuts were collected by many European artists, including Degas, Gauguin, Klimt, Franz Marc, August Macke, \u00c9douard Manet, and van Gogh. Degas said of him, \"Hokusai is not just one artist among others in the Floating World. He is an island, a continent, a whole world in himself\". Hermann Obrist's whiplash motif, or \"Peitschenhieb\", which came to exemplify the new movement, is visibly influenced by Hokusai's work.\nThe French composer Claude Debussy's tone poem La Mer, which debuted in 1905, is believed to have been inspired by Hokusai's print \"The Great Wave.\" The composer had an impression of it hanging in his living room and specifically requested that it be used on the cover of the published score, which was widely distributed, and the music itself incorporated Japanese-inflected harmonies.\nEven after his death, exhibitions of his artworks continue to grow. In 2005, Tokyo National Museum held a Hokusai exhibition which had the largest number of visitors of any exhibit there that year. Several paintings from the Tokyo exhibition were also exhibited in the United Kingdom. The British Museum held the first exhibition of Hokusai's later year artworks including \"'The Great Wave'\" in 2017.\nHokusai inspired the Hugo Award\u2013winning short story by science fiction author Roger Zelazny, \"24 Views of Mt. Fuji, by Hokusai\", in which the protagonist tours the area surrounding Mount Fuji, stopping at locations painted by Hokusai. A 2011 book on mindfulness closes with the poem \"Hokusai Says\" by Roger Keyes, preceded with the explanation that \"[s]ometimes poetry captures the soul of an idea better than anything else\".\nIn the 1985 \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\", Richard Lane characterizes Hokusai as \"since the later 19th century [having] impressed Western artists, critics and art lovers alike, more, possibly, than any other single Asian artist\".\n\"'Store Selling Picture Books and Ukiyo-e'\" by Hokusai shows how ukiyo-e during the time was actually sold; it shows how these prints were sold at local shops, and ordinary people could buy ukiyo-e. Unusually in this image, Hokusai used a hand-colored approach instead of using several separated woodblocks.\nHis youngest daughter Ei has her own manga and film called \"Miss Hokusai\".\nA biographical film about the painter was released in Japan on 28 May 2021. It was premiered at the 33rd Tokyo International Film Festival.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nSpecific works of art.\nFor readers who want more information on specific works of art by Hokusai, these particular works are recommended.\nArt monographs.\nMonographs dedicated to Hokusai art works:"}

{"id": "43365", "revid": "18261421", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43365", "title": "George Streeter", "text": "American criminal\nGeorge Wellington \"Cap\" Streeter (c. 1837 \u2013 January 22, 1921) was an American who became infamous in Chicago for his real estate schemes and oftentimes bizarre eccentricity. From 1886 to 1921, Streeter, often through forgery and other manipulative means, attempted to lay claim to of Lake Michigan shoreline from various owners. Failing in his efforts to defraud wealthy landowners, he turned to selling the disputed land to uninformed buyers. A portion of the real estate near downtown Chicago, known as Streeterville, is named for him.\nStreeter in legend.\nDuring a storm on July 10, 1886, the former Mississippi River boat captain and circus owner ran his steamboat, the 35-ton https://, onto a sandbar off Chicago's north shore near the foot of Superior Street.\nUnable to move the vessel, which slowly silted into place, Streeter claimed it made up the independent \"United States District of Lake Michigan\" and thereby was not subject to the laws of Illinois or Chicago.\nEver since the downtown cleanup after the Great Fire in 1871, Lake Michigan had been used as a dump by building contractors looking to get rid of backfill and general rubble. Streeter invited such contractors to dump their rubble on the sandbar where the \"Reutan\" sat, extending the size of his land considerably. Over time, this landfill connected the \"Reutan\" to the city. As the landmass grew, collecting more dumped rubble as well as silt from the lake, Streeter began to issue deeds to the land to others who saw themselves as \"homesteaders\" in the growing city of Chicago. City planners and founders saw otherwise.\nThat summer, industrialist N.K. Fairbank, who claimed rights to the area, arrived to inform Streeter he was an illegal squatter and would have to leave. Streeter chased Fairbank off with a shotgun. Shortly thereafter, Streeter also chased away the constables who had come to evict him. Further attempts to remove them were met with gunfire and pots of scalding water. After one such raid resulted in his arrest for assault with a deadly weapon, Streeter was acquitted on the grounds that birdshot was not considered deadly.\nAlthough Fairbank sued Streeter in 1890 and won, Streeter maintained his hold on the District, which was now home to prostitutes, the homeless and other \"undesirables.\" In 1892, it was estimated that the land was worth around $300,000, a substantial sum in that era.\nDuring the World's Columbian Exposition, Streeter refloated the \"Reutan\" and used it to ferry passengers between Streeterville and the exposition grounds at Jackson Park.\nFrom 1894 on, there were many attempts to forcibly remove Streeter from the district, often for violating laws that prohibited the sale of liquor on Sunday. In cases in which police were injured by axes and gunfire, Streeter and his men were invariably found not guilty due to acting in self-defense. Streeter's fight for what he considered his land continued until his death on January 22, 1921, although he and his second wife had left Streeterville to move to East Chicago, Indiana, in 1918. The Streeters' heirs continued to lay claim on the land until April 1928, when the courts ruled in favor of Chicago Title and Trust. Despite all the bad blood, the mayor of Chicago attended Streeter's funeral.\nReality.\nStreeter was born in Flint, Michigan, in 1837. He served in the Civil War, but was not a captain. He was a salesman, the owner of a traveling circus, a logger, and a miner. After his first wife left him to join a vaudeville troupe, he moved to Chicago and acquired the steamship Reutan. He and his common-law wife planned to use the \"Reutan\" to run guns to Latin America. But fuel was expensive, and the distances great, and he saw an opportunity close by, in Chicago.\nStreeter clearly lied about his discovery of the \"District of Lake Michigan\". In 1886, he referenced a map published in 1821 to determine that his \"District\" was outside the city limits. A storm did not smash Streeter's ship into a sandbar on the night of July 10, 1886. Weather reports for that night make no mention of a storm. Streeter did not really believe that he could fill in the shoreline and legally claim the new land. A witness in Streeter's 1902 land fraud trial testified that Streeter had purposely set out to contest the claims of the wealthy shoreline owners. Contractor Hank Brusser told the court that Streeter asked him to fill in portions of the shoreline in order to create confusion over land titles. According to Brusser, Streeter said that: \"They (the owners of the shoreline) will have to buy us off\" and that \"We'll get a million out of it\". The recorder of the general land office, Chester H. Brush, testified that Streeter's title was \"a clumsy forgery\" with signatures mismatched with offices. Silas Lamoreaux was commissioner and not recorder; Hoke Smith was Secretary of the Interior, not secretary to sign patents.\nIn reality, Streeter orchestrated an elaborate scheme to steal valuable shoreline property. He did not crash his ship on a sandbar, he piloted it to the foot of Superior Street and then obtained permission from the shoreline owner, Fairbank, to leave his ship there temporarily. He left it there for years. Streeter refused to move his ship insisting that he had title to the shoreline, producing a forged land title, concocted his story of crashing on a sandbar, and then proceeded to sell lots that he did not legally own. He even began collecting property taxes for the lots he sold and kept detailed tax records.\nIn 1893 police removed Streeter and his boat from Fairbank's land. Streeter then moved to the posh Tremont Hotel from where he proceeded to expand his operations. He sold shoreline belonging to Fairbank, the William Ogden estate, the Farwell family, Potter Palmer, the Pine Street Land Association and the Chicago Title and Trust Company. In all, Streeter claimed to own of land between the mouth of the Chicago River and Oak Street. The reality was that the Lincoln Park Board had worked to fill in the shoreline in that area, so that they could build Lake Shore Drive on the infill.\nStreeter continued to sell lots to people who either believed his story or believed his forged federal land grant. To bolster his claims, to pressure owners to pay him off, and to assuage those who had bought lots from him in earnest, Streeter staged a series of \"invasions\", when he would lead a small group of squatters carrying shacks to the lake shore to quickly set up settlements. The shoreline owners would respond by sending thugs and/or police to evict them. Streeter would then vociferously complain that he was a victim of a capitalistic conspiracy to rob him of his land. This repeated itself again and again until Streeter was convicted of manslaughter, in 1902, and sent to prison. Streeter died at the age of 84, in 1921, of pneumonia.\nThe site of Streeter's shanty is currently occupied by the John Hancock Center, and the surrounding Chicago neighborhood is known as Streeterville.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His father Theodore, one of the secretaries of Emperor Constantine V, had been scourged and banished to Nicaea for his zealous support of Iconodules, and the son inherited the religious convictions of the father.\nWhile still young Nicephorus was brought to the court, where he became an imperial secretary and entered the service of the Empire. Under Empress Irene of Athens he took part in the synod of 787 of Nicaea as imperial commissioner. He then withdrew to one of the cloisters that he had founded on the Thracian Bosporus. There he devoted himself to ascetic practices and to the study both of secular learning, as grammar, mathematics, and philosophy, and the Scriptures. Around 802 he was recalled and appointed director of the largest hospital for the destitute in Constantinople.\nAfter the death of the Patriarch Tarasios of Constantinople, there was great division among the clergy and higher court officials as to the choice of his successor. Although still a layman, Nicephorus was chosen patriarch by the wish of the emperor (Easter, 12 April 806). The uncanonical choice met with opposition from the strictly clerical party of the Stoudites, and this opposition intensified into an open break when Nicephorus I, in other respects a very rigid moralist, showed himself compliant to the will of the emperor by reinstating the excommunicated priest Joseph.\nAfter vain theological disputes, in December 814, there followed personal insults. Nicephorus I at first replied to his removal from his office by excommunication, but at last, under Emperor Leo V the Armenian was obliged to yield to force, and was taken to one of the cloisters he had founded, \"Tou Agathou\", and later to that called \"Tou Hagiou Theodorou\". From there he carried on a literary polemic for the cause of the iconodules against the synod of 815. On the occasion of the change of emperors, in 820, he was put forward as a candidate for the patriarchate and at least obtained the promise of toleration.\nHe died at the monastery of Saint Theodore (\"Hagiou Theodorou\"), revered as a confessor. His remains were solemnly brought back to Constantinople by Methodios I of Constantinople on 13 March 847 and interred in the Church of the Holy Apostles, where they were annually the object of imperial devotion. His feast is celebrated on this day both in the Greek and Roman Churches; the Greeks also observe 2 June as the day of his death.\nWorks.\nCompared with Theodore the Studite, Nicephorus I appears as a friend of conciliation, learned in patristics, more inclined to take the defensive than the offensive, and possessed of a comparatively chaste, simple style. He was mild in his ecclesiastical and monastical rules and non-partisan in his historical treatment of the period from 602 to 769 (\"Historia syntomos, breviarium\"). He used the chronicle of Trajan the Patrician but deliberately chose not to name the source so as to connect himself to the historical tradition of Theophylact Simocatta. The \"Short History\" is thematically focused around the matter of the offices of emperor and patriarch. Nicephorus I attempted to salvage the reputation of the patriarchate by criticising iconoclast patriarchs for submitting to the emperor, not for being iconoclasts. Emperor Heraclius was the ideal emperor in Nicephorus I's scheme because of how he worked alongside patriarch Sergius I of Constantinople, but also how Sergius I helped to defend Constantinople from the Avars in 626 as well as the patriarch's ability to discipline the emperor for his marriage to his niece Martina. Heraclius failure to heed the Egyptian patriarch's advice is what ultimately brought about the Arab conquest of Egypt.\nHis tables of universal history, \"Chronography\" or \"Chronographikon Syntomon\", in passages extended and continued, were in great favor with the Byzantines, and were also circulated outside the Empire in the Latin version of Anastasius Bibliothecarius, and also in Slavonic translation. The \"Chronography\" offered a universal history from the time of Adam and Eve to his own time. To it he appended a canon catalog (which does not include the \"Book of Revelation\" of John of Patmos). The catalog of the accepted books of the Old and New Testaments is followed by the \"antilegomena\" (including \"Revelation\") and the apocrypha. Next to each book is the count of its lines, his Stichometry of Nicephorus, to which we can compare our accepted texts and judge how much has been added or omitted. This is especially useful for apocrypha for which only fragmentary texts have survived.\nThe principal works of Nicephorus I are three writings referring to iconoclasm:\nNicephorus I follows in the path of John of Damascus. His merit is the thoroughness with which he traced the literary and traditional proofs, and his detailed refutations are serviceable for the knowledge they afford of important texts adduced by his opponents and in part drawn from the older church literature.\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

After achieving success in the Western TV series \"Rawhide\", Eastwood rose to international fame with his role as the \"Man with No Name\" in Sergio Leone's \"Dollars Trilogy\" of spaghetti Westerns during the mid-1960s and as antihero cop Harry Callahan in the five \"Dirty Harry\" films throughout the 1970s and 1980s. These roles, among others, have made Eastwood an enduring cultural icon of masculinity. Elected in 1986, Eastwood served for two years as the mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California.\nEastwood's greatest commercial successes are the adventure comedy \"Every Which Way but Loose\" (1978) and its action comedy sequel \"Any Which Way You Can\" (1980). Other popular Eastwood films include the Westerns \"Hang 'Em High\" (1968), \"The Outlaw Josey Wales\" (1976) and \"Pale Rider\" (1985), the action-war film \"Where Eagles Dare\" (1968), the prison film \"Escape from Alcatraz\" (1979), the war film \"Heartbreak Ridge\" (1986), the action film \"In the Line of Fire\" (1993), and the romantic drama \"The Bridges of Madison County\" (1995). More recent works include \"Gran Torino\" (2008), \"The Mule\" (2018), and \"Cry Macho\" (2021). Since 1967, Eastwood's company Malpaso Productions has produced all but four of his American films.\nAn Academy Award nominee for Best Actor, Eastwood won Best Director and Best Picture for his Western film \"Unforgiven\" (1992) and his sports drama \"Million Dollar Baby\" (2004). In addition to directing many of his own star vehicles, Eastwood has directed films in which he did not appear, such as the mystery drama \"Mystic River\" (2003) and the war film \"Letters from Iwo Jima\" (2006), for which he received Academy Award nominations, as well as the legal thriller \"Juror #2\" (2024). He also directed the biographical films \"Changeling\" (2008), \"Invictus\" (2009), \"American Sniper\" (2014), \"Sully\" (2016), and \"Richard Jewell\" (2019).\nEastwood's accolades include four Academy Awards, four Golden Globe Awards, three C\u00e9sar Awards, and an AFI Life Achievement Award. In 2000, he received the Italian Venice Film Festival's Golden Lion award, honoring his lifetime achievements. Bestowed two of France's highest civilian honors, he received the Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 1994, and the Legion of Honour in 2007.\nEarly life.\nEastwood was born on May 31, 1930, at Saint Francis Memorial Hospital in San Francisco, to Ruth (n\u00e9e Margret Runner; 1909\u20132006) and Clinton Eastwood (1906\u20131970), who then lived in Oakland's Lake Merritt neighborhood. During her son's fame, Ruth was known by the surname of her second husband, John Belden Wood (1913\u20132004), whom she married after the death of Clinton Sr. Eastwood was nicknamed \"Samson\" by hospital nurses because he weighed at birth. He has a younger sister, Jeanne Bernhardt (b. 1934).\nHe is of English, Irish, Scottish, and Dutch ancestry. Eastwood is descended from \"Mayflower\" passenger William Bradford, and through this line is the 12th generation born in North America. His family relocated three times during the 1930s as his father changed occupations. Contrary to what Eastwood has indicated in media interviews, they did not move between 1940 and 1949. Settling in Piedmont, California, the Eastwoods lived in an affluent area of the town, had a swimming pool, belonged to a country club, and each parent drove their own car. Eastwood's father was a manufacturing executive at Georgia-Pacific for most of his working life. As Clint and Jeanne grew older, Ruth took a clerical job at IBM.\nEastwood attended Piedmont Middle School, where he was held back due to poor academic scores, and records indicate he also had to attend summer school. From January 1945 until at least January 1946, he attended Piedmont High School, but was asked to leave for writing an obscene suggestion to a school official on the athletic field scoreboard and burning an effigy on the school lawn, on top of other school infractions. He transferred to Oakland Technical High School and graduated on February 2, 1949.\nEastwood held a number of odd jobs, including lifeguard, paper carrier, grocery clerk, forest firefighter, and golf caddy. Eastwood said that he tried to enroll at Seattle University in 1951, but instead was drafted into the United States Army during the Korean War. Don Loomis recalled hearing that Eastwood was romancing one of the daughters of a Fort Ord officer, who might have been entreated to watch out for him when names came up for postings. While returning from a prearranged tryst in Seattle, he was a passenger on a Douglas AD bomber that ran out of fuel and crashed into the ocean near Point Reyes. Using a life raft, he and the pilot swam to safety. Eastwood was discharged in February 1953.\nCareer.\n1954\u20131962: acting debut and \"Rawhide\".\nAccording to a CBS press release for \"Rawhide\", Universal-International's camera crew was shooting in Fort Ord when an enterprising assistant spotted Eastwood and invited him to meet the director, although this is disputed by Eastwood's unauthorized biographer, Patrick McGilligan. According to Eastwood's official biography, the key figure was a man named Chuck Hill, who was stationed in Fort Ord and had contacts in Hollywood. While in Los Angeles, Hill became reacquainted with Eastwood and managed to sneak him into a Universal studio, where he introduced him to cameraman Irving Glassberg. Glassberg arranged for an audition under Arthur Lubin, who, although very impressed with Eastwood's appearance and stature (then ), disapproved of his acting, remarking, \"He was quite amateurish. He didn't know which way to turn or which way to go or do anything.\" Lubin suggested that he attend drama classes and arranged for Eastwood's initial contract in April 1954, at $100 per week. After signing, Eastwood was initially criticized for his stiff manner and delivering his lines through his teeth, a lifelong trademark.\nIn May 1954, Eastwood made his first real audition for \"Six Bridges to Cross\", but was rejected by Joseph Pevney. After many unsuccessful auditions, he was eventually given a minor role by director Jack Arnold in \"Revenge of the Creature\" (1955), a sequel to the recently released \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\". In September 1954, Eastwood worked for three weeks on Arthur Lubin's \"Lady Godiva of Coventry\", won a role in February 1955, playing \"Jonesy\", a sailor in \"Francis in the Navy\" and appeared uncredited in another Jack Arnold film, \"Tarantula\", where he played a squadron pilot. In May 1955, Eastwood put four hours' work into the film \"Never Say Goodbye\" and had a minor uncredited role as a ranch hand in August 1955 with \"Star in the Dust\", starring John Agar and Mamie Van Doren, the latter of whom he dated briefly. Universal presented him with his first television role on July 2, 1955, on NBC's \"Allen in Movieland\", which starred comedian Steve Allen, actor Tony Curtis, and swing musician Benny Goodman. Although he continued to develop as an actor, Universal terminated his contract on October 23, 1955.\nEastwood joined the Marsh Agency, and although Lubin landed him his biggest role to date in \"The First Traveling Saleslady\" (1956) and later hired him for \"Escapade in Japan\" (1957), without a formal contract, Eastwood was struggling. On his financial advisor Irving Leonard's advice, he switched to the Kumin-Olenick Agency in 1956 and Mitchell Gertz in 1957. He landed several small roles in 1956 as a temperamental army officer for a segment of ABC's \"Reader's Digest\" series, and as a motorcycle gang member on a \"Highway Patrol\" episode. In 1957, Eastwood played a cadet in the \"West Point\" series and a suicidal gold prospector on \"Death Valley Days\".\nIn 1958, he played a Navy lieutenant in a segment of \"Navy Log\" and in early 1959 made a notable guest appearance as Red Hardigan on \"Maverick\" opposite James Garner as a cowardly villain intent on marrying a rich girl for money. Eastwood had a small part as an aviator in \"Lafayette Escadrille\" (1958) and played a major role as an ex-renegade of the Confederacy in \"Ambush at Cimarron Pass\" (also 1958), a film that Eastwood considers the low point of his career.\nIn 1958, Eastwood was cast as Rowdy Yates in the CBS hour-long western series \"Rawhide\", the career breakthrough he had long sought. Eastwood was not especially happy with his character; Eastwood was almost 30, and Rowdy was too young and cloddish for his comfort. Filming began in Arizona in the summer of 1958. It took just three weeks for \"Rawhide\" to reach the top 20 in TV ratings and, although it never won an Emmy, it was a major success for several years, and peaked at number six in the ratings from October 1960 to April 1961. The \"Rawhide\" years (1959\u201365) were some of the most grueling of Eastwood's career, often filming six days a week for an average of 12 hours a day, but some directors still criticized him for not working hard enough. By late 1963, \"Rawhide\" was beginning to decline in the ratings and lacked freshness in the scripts; it was canceled in the middle of the 1965\u201366 season. Eastwood made his first attempt at directing when he filmed several trailers for the show, but was unable to convince producers to let him direct an episode. In the show's first season, Eastwood earned $750 an episode. At the time of \"Rawhide\"'s cancellation, he received $119,000 an episode as severance pay.\n1963\u20131969: spaghetti Westerns and stardom.\nIn late 1963, Eastwood's \"Rawhide\" co-star Eric Fleming rejected an offer to star in an Italian-made western called \"A Fistful of Dollars\" (1964), filmed in a remote region of Spain by a then relatively unknown director, Sergio Leone. Richard Harrison suggested Eastwood to Leone because Harrison knew that Eastwood could play a cowboy convincingly. Eastwood thought the film would be an opportunity to escape from his \"Rawhide\" image. He signed a contract for $15,000 in wages for eleven weeks' work, with a bonus of a Mercedes-Benz automobile upon completion. Eastwood later said of the transition from a TV western to \"A Fistful of Dollars\": \"In \"Rawhide\" I did get awfully tired of playing the conventional white hat. The hero who kisses old ladies and dogs and was kind to everybody. I decided it was time to be an antihero.\" Eastwood was instrumental in creating the Man with No Name character's distinctive visual style and, although a nonsmoker, Leone insisted Eastwood smoke cigars as an essential ingredient of the \"mask\" he was attempting to create for the character. \"I needed a mask more than an actor,\" Leone would later explain, \"and back then Eastwood had only two facial expressions: with the hat and without the hat\".\n\"A Fistful of Dollars\" proved a landmark in the development of spaghetti Westerns, with Leone depicting a more lawless and desolate world than traditional westerns, and challenging American stereotypes of a western hero with a morally ambiguous antihero. The film's success made Eastwood a major star in Italy and he was rehired to star in \"For a Few Dollars More\" (1965), the second of the trilogy. Through the efforts of screenwriter Luciano Vincenzoni, the rights to \"For a Few Dollars More\" and the trilogy's final film, \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" (1966), were sold to United Artists for about $900,000.\nIn January 1966, Eastwood met producer Dino De Laurentiis in New York City and agreed to star in a non-Western five-part anthology production, \"The Witches\" (\"Le Streghe\", 1967), opposite De Laurentiis's wife, Silvana Mangano. Eastwood's 19-minute installment took only a few days to shoot. Two months later he began work on \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\", again playing the mysterious Man with No Name. Lee Van Cleef returned as a ruthless fortune seeker, with Eli Wallach portraying the Mexican bandit Tuco Ramirez. The storyline involved the search for a cache of Confederate gold buried in a cemetery. During the filming of a scene in which a bridge was blown up, Eastwood urged Wallach to retreat to a hilltop. \"I know about these things\", he said. \"Stay as far away from special effects and explosives as you can.\" Minutes later, confusion among the crew over the word \"Vaya!\" resulted in a premature explosion that could have killed Wallach.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I wanted to play it with an economy of words and create this whole feeling through attitude and movement. It was just the kind of character I had envisioned for a long time, keep to the mystery and allude to what happened in the past. It came about after the frustration of doing \"Rawhide\" for so long. I felt the less he said, the stronger he became and the more he grew in the imagination of the audience.\u2014\u200a\nThe \"Dollars\" trilogy was not released in the United States until 1967, when \"A Fistful of Dollars\" opened on January 18, followed by \"For a Few Dollars More\" on May 10, and \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" on December 29. All three were commercially successful, particularly \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\", which eventually earned $8\u00a0million in rental earnings and turned Eastwood into a major film star being ranked for the first time on Quigley's Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll in 1968 in fifth place. All three received poor reviews, and marked the beginning of a battle for Eastwood to win American film critics' respect. Judith Crist described \"A Fistful of Dollars\" as \"cheapjack\", while \"Newsweek\" called \"For a Few Dollars More\" \"excruciatingly dopey\". Renata Adler of \"The New York Times\" said \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" was \"the most expensive, pious and repellent movie in the history of its peculiar genre\". \"Time\" drew attention to the film's wooden acting, especially Eastwood's, though a few critics such as Vincent Canby and Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" praised his coolness. Leone's cinematography was widely acclaimed, even by critics who disparaged the acting.\nStardom brought Eastwood more roles. He signed to star in the American revisionist western \"Hang 'Em High\" (1968) alongside Inger Stevens, Pat Hingle, Ed Begley, playing a man who takes up a marshal's badge and seeks revenge as a lawman after being lynched by vigilantes and left for dead. The film earned Eastwood $400,000 and 25% of its net box office. Using money earned from the \"Dollars\" trilogy, Eastwood's advisor Irving Leonard helped establish Eastwood's own production company, Malpaso Productions, named after Malpaso Creek on Eastwood's property in Monterey County, California. The 38-year-old actor was still relatively unknown as late as a month prior to the film's release, as evidenced by a July 1968 news item by syndicated columnist Dorothy Manners: \"The proverbial man in the street is still asking, 'Who's Clint Eastwood?'\" Leonard arranged for \"Hang 'Em High\" to be a joint production with United Artists; when it opened in August, it had the largest opening weekend in United Artists' history. \"Hang 'Em High\" was widely praised by critics, including Archer Winsten of the \"New York Post\", who called it \"a western of quality, courage, danger and excitement\".\nBefore \"Hang 'Em High\"'s release, Eastwood had already begun working on \"Coogan's Bluff\" (1968), about an Arizona deputy sheriff tracking a wanted psychopathic criminal (Don Stroud) through New York City. He was reunited with Universal Studios for it after receiving an offer of $1\u00a0million\u00a0\u2013 more than double his previous salary. Jennings Lang arranged for Eastwood to meet Don Siegel, a Universal contract director who later became Eastwood's close friend, forming a partnership that would last more than ten years and produce five films. Shooting began in November 1967, before the script had been finalized. The film was controversial for its portrayal of violence. \"Coogan's Bluff\" also became the first collaboration with Argentine composer Lalo Schifrin, who scored several Eastwood films in the 1970s and 1980s, including the \"Dirty Harry\" films.\nEastwood was paid $750,000 for the war epic \"Where Eagles Dare\" (1968), about a World War II squad parachuting into a Gestapo stronghold in the Alps. Richard Burton played the squad's commander, with Eastwood as his right-hand man. Eastwood was also cast as Two-Face in the \"Batman\" television show, but the series was canceled before filming began.\nEastwood then branched out to co-star in a musical, \"Paint Your Wagon\" (1969). Eastwood and Lee Marvin play gold miners who buy a Mormon settler's less favored wife (Jean Seberg) at an auction. Bad weather and delays plagued the production, and the film's budget eventually exceeded $20\u00a0million, which was high for the time. The film was not a critical or commercial success, but was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy.\n1970\u20131989: directorial debut and \"Dirty Harry\".\nEastwood starred with Shirley MacLaine in the western \"Two Mules for Sister Sara\" (1970), directed by Don Siegel. The film follows an American mercenary, who becomes mixed up with a prostitute disguised as a nun, and ends up helping a group of Juarista rebels during the reign of Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico. Eastwood again played a mysterious stranger\u00a0\u2013 unshaven, wearing a serape-like vest, and smoking a cigar. Although it received moderate reviews, the film is listed in \"The New York Times Guide to the Best 1,000\u00a0Movies Ever Made\". Around the same time, Eastwood starred as one of a group of Americans who steals a fortune in gold from the Nazis, in the World War II film \"Kelly's Heroes\" (also 1970), with Donald Sutherland and Telly Savalas. \"Kelly's Heroes\" was the last film Eastwood appeared in that was not produced by his own Malpaso Productions. Shot on location in Yugoslavia and London, the film received mostly a positive reception and its anti-war sentiments were recognized. Siegel directed Eastwood's next film, \"The Beguiled\" (1971), a tale of a wounded Union soldier, held captive by the sexually repressed matron (played by Geraldine Page) of a Southern girls' school. Upon release the film received major recognition in France and is considered one of Eastwood's finest works by French critics. However, it grossed less than $1\u00a0million and, according to Eastwood and Lang, flopped due to poor publicity and the \"emasculated\" role of Eastwood.\nEastwood's career reached a turning point in 1971. Before Irving Leonard died, he and Eastwood had discussed the idea of Malpaso producing \"Play Misty for Me\", a film that was to give Eastwood the artistic control he desired, and his debut as a director. The script was about a jazz disc jockey named Dave (Eastwood), who has a casual affair with Evelyn (Jessica Walter), a listener who had been calling the radio station repeatedly at night, asking him to play her favorite song \u2013 Erroll Garner's \"Misty\". When Dave ends their relationship, the unhinged Evelyn becomes a murderous stalker. Filming commenced in Monterey in September 1970 and included footage of that year's Monterey Jazz Festival. The film was highly acclaimed with critics, such as Jay Cocks in \"Time\", Andrew Sarris in the \"Village Voice\", and Archer Winsten in the \"New York Post\" all praising the film, as well as Eastwood's directorial skills and performance. Walter was nominated for a Golden Globe Best Actress Award (Drama), for her performance in the film.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I know what you're thinking\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\"Did he fire six shots or only five?\" Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I've kinda lost track myself. But, being as this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world and would blow your head clean off, you've got to ask yourself one question: \"Do I feel lucky?\" Well, do you, punk?\u2014\u200a\n\"Dirty Harry\" (1971), written by Harry and Rita Fink, centers on a hard-edged New York City (later changed to San Francisco) police inspector named Harry Callahan who is determined to stop a psychotic killer by any means. \"Dirty Harry\" has been described as being arguably Eastwood's most memorable character, and the film has been credited with inventing the \"loose-cannon cop\" genre. Author Eric Lichtenfeld argues that Eastwood's role as Dirty Harry established the \"first true archetype\" of the action film genre. His lines (quoted above) are regarded by firearms historians, such as Garry James and Richard Venola, as the force that catapulted the ownership of .44 Magnum revolvers to new heights in the United States; specifically the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 29 carried by Harry Callahan. \"Dirty Harry\", released in December 1971, earned $22\u00a0million in the United States and Canada. It was Siegel's highest-grossing film and the start of a series of films featuring the character Harry Callahan. Although a number of critics praised Eastwood's performance as Dirty Harry, such as Jay Cocks who described him as \"giving his best performance so far, tense, tough, full of implicit identification with his character\", the film was also widely criticized as being fascistic. After having been second for the past two years, Eastwood was voted first in Quigley's Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll in 1972 and again in 1973.\nFollowing Sean Connery's announcement that he would not play James Bond again, Eastwood was offered the role but turned it down, saying, \"that was someone else's gig. That's Sean's deal. It didn't feel right for me to be doing it.\" He next starred in the loner Western \"Joe Kidd\" (1972), based on a character inspired by Reies Lopez Tijerina, who stormed a courthouse in Tierra Amarilla, New Mexico, in June 1967. During filming, Eastwood suffered symptoms of a bronchial infection and several panic attacks. \"Joe Kidd\" received a mixed reception, with Roger Greenspun of \"The New York Times\" writing that it was unremarkable, with foolish symbolism and sloppy editing, although he praised Eastwood's performance.\nEastwood's first western as director was \"High Plains Drifter\" (1973), in which he also starred. The film had a moral and supernatural theme, later emulated in \"Pale Rider\". The plot follows a mysterious stranger (Eastwood) who arrives in a brooding Western town where the people hire him to protect them against three soon-to-be-released felons. There remains confusion during the film as to whether the stranger is the brother of the deputy, whom the felons lynched and murdered, or his ghost. Holes in the plot were filled with black humor and allegory, influenced by Leone. The revisionist film received a mixed reception, but was a major box-office success. A number of critics thought Eastwood's directing was \"as derivative as it was expressive\", with Arthur Knight of the \"Saturday Review\" remarking that Eastwood had \"absorbed the approaches of Siegel and Leone and fused them with his own paranoid vision of society\". John Wayne, who had declined a role in the film, sent a letter to Eastwood soon after the film's release in which he complained that, \"The townspeople did not represent the true spirit of the American pioneer, the spirit that made America great.\"\nEastwood next turned his attention towards \"Breezy\" (1973), a film starring William Holden and Kay Lenz about love blossoming between a middle-aged man and a teenage girl. Various actresses had lobbied for the title role, including Eastwood's future longtime companion Sondra Locke, who at 29 was nearly twice the character's age. The film, shot very quickly and efficiently by Frank Stanley, came in $1\u00a0million under budget and was finished three days ahead of schedule. \"Breezy\" was not a major critical or commercial success. Eastwood then stepped back in front of the camera to reprise his role as Harry Callahan in \"Magnum Force\" (1973), a sequel to \"Dirty Harry\", about a group of rogue young officers (among them David Soul, Robert Urich, and Tim Matheson) in the San Francisco Police Department who systematically exterminate the city's worst criminals. Although the film was a major success after release, grossing $58.1\u00a0million in the United States (a record for Eastwood), it was not a critical success. \"The New York Times\" critic Nora Sayre panned the often contradictory moral themes of the film, while the paper's Frank Rich called it \"the same old stuff\".\nEastwood teamed up with Jeff Bridges and George Kennedy in the buddy action caper \"Thunderbolt and Lightfoot\" (1974), a road movie about a veteran bank robber Thunderbolt (Eastwood) and a young con man drifter, Lightfoot (Bridges). On its release, in spring 1974, the film was praised for its offbeat comedy mixed with high suspense and tragedy but was only a modest success at the box office, earning $32.4\u00a0million. Eastwood's acting was noted by critics, but was overshadowed by Bridges who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Eastwood reportedly fumed at the lack of Academy Award recognition for him and swore that he would never work for United Artists again.\nEastwood's next film \"The Eiger Sanction\" (1975) was based on Trevanian's critically acclaimed spy novel of the same name. Eastwood plays Jonathan Hemlock in a role originally intended for Paul Newman, an assassin turned college art professor who decides to return to his former profession for one last \"sanction\" in return for a rare Pissarro painting. In the process he must climb the north face of the Eiger in Switzerland under perilous conditions. Mike Hoover taught Eastwood how to climb during several weeks of preparation at Yosemite before filming commenced in Grindelwald, Switzerland. Despite prior warnings about the perils of the Eiger, Eastwood insisted on doing all his own climbing and stunts. The film crew suffered a number of accidents, including one fatality. Eastwood cast former Bond girl Claudine Auger as his love interest, but deleted her entire performance from the movie. Upon release in May 1975, \"The Eiger Sanction\" was marginally successful commercially, receiving $14.2\u00a0million at the box-office, and gained mixed reviews. Joy Gould Boyum of \"The Wall Street Journal\" dismissed the film as \"brutal fantasy\". Eastwood blamed Universal Studios for the film's poor promotion and turned his back on them to make an agreement with Warner Bros., through Frank Wells, that has lasted to the present day.\n\"The Outlaw Josey Wales\" (1976), a western inspired by Asa Carter's 1972\u00a0novel of the same name, has lead character Josey Wales (Eastwood) as a pro-Confederate guerrilla who refuses to surrender his arms after the American Civil War and is chased across the old southwest by a group of enforcers. The supporting cast included Locke as his love interest and Chief Dan George as an elderly Cherokee who strikes up a friendship with Wales. Director Philip Kaufman was fired by producer Bob Daley under Eastwood's command in October 1975, three weeks into the shoot, resulting in a fine reported to be around $60,000 from the Directors Guild of America\u00a0\u2013 who subsequently passed new legislation reserving the right to impose a major fine on a producer for discharging and replacing a director. The film was pre-screened at the Sun Valley Center for the Arts and Humanities in Idaho during a six-day conference entitled \"Western Movies: Myths and Images\". Invited to the screening were a number of well-known film critics, including Jay Cocks and Arthur Knight; directors such as King Vidor, William Wyler, and Howard Hawks; and a number of academics. Upon release in the summer of 1976 \"The Outlaw Josey Wales\" was widely acclaimed, with many critics and viewers seeing Eastwood's role as an iconic one that related to America's ancestral past and the destiny of the nation after the American Civil War. Roger Ebert compared the nature and vulnerability of Eastwood's portrayal of Josey Wales with his Man with No Name character in the \"Dollars\" westerns and praised the film's atmosphere. The film would later appear in \"Time\"'s \"Top 10 Films of the Year\".\nEastwood was then offered the role of Benjamin L. Willard in Francis Coppola's \"Apocalypse Now\", but declined as he did not want to spend weeks on location in the Philippines. He also refused the part of a platoon leader in Ted Post's Vietnam War film, \"Go Tell the Spartans\" and instead decided to make a third \"Dirty Harry\" film, \"The Enforcer\" (1976). The film had Callahan partnered with a new female officer (Tyne Daly) to face a San Francisco Bay area group resembling the Symbionese Liberation Army. The film, culminating in a shootout on Alcatraz island, was considerably shorter than the previous \"Dirty Harry\" films at 95minutes, but was a major commercial success grossing $100\u00a0million worldwide to become Eastwood's highest-grossing film to date.\nEastwood directed and starred in \"The Gauntlet\" (1977) opposite Locke, Pat Hingle, William Prince, Bill McKinney, and Mara Corday. In this film, he portrays a down-and-out cop assigned to escort a prostitute from Las Vegas to Phoenix to testify against the mob. Although a moderate hit with the viewing public, critics had mixed feelings about the film, with many believing it was overly violent. Ebert, in contrast, gave the film three stars and called it \"classic Clint Eastwood: fast, furious, and funny\". In \"Every Which Way but Loose\" (1978), he had an uncharacteristic offbeat comedy role. His character, Philo Beddoe, is a trucker and brawler who roams the American West searching for a lost love (Locke) accompanied by his best friend, Orville Boggs (played by Geoffrey Lewis) and an orangutan called Clyde. The film proved surprisingly successful upon its release and became Eastwood's most commercially successful film up to that time. Panned by critics, it ranked high among the box-office successes of his career and was the second-highest-grossing film of 1978.\nEastwood starred in \"Escape from Alcatraz\" (1979), the last of his films directed by Siegel. It was based on the true story of Frank Lee Morris who, along with John and Clarence Anglin, escaped from the notorious Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary in 1962. The film was a major success; Stanley Kauffmann of \"The New Republic\" praised it as \"crystalline cinema\" and Frank Rich of \"Time\" described it as \"cool, cinematic grace\".\nEastwood directed and enacted the title role in \"Bronco Billy\" (1980), alongside Locke, Scatman Crothers, and Sam Bottoms. Filming commenced on October 1, 1979, in the Boise metropolitan area and was shot in five and a half weeks on a budget of $5\u00a0million. Cinematographer David Worth stated, \"Being able to capture the true love between Clint and Sondra was very special.\" Eastwood has cited \"Bronco Billy\" as being one of the most relaxed shoots of his career and biographer Richard Schickel argued that Bronco Billy is Eastwood's most self-referential character. The film was a commercial disappointment, but was liked by critics. Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" wrote that film was \"the best and funniest Clint Eastwood movie in quite a while\", and praised Eastwood's directing, intricately juxtaposing the old West and the new West. Released later in 1980, \"Any Which Way You Can\" was the sequel to \"Every Which Way but Loose\" and also starring Eastwood. The film received a number of bad reviews from critics, although Maslin described it as \"funnier and even better than its predecessor\". In theaters over the Christmas season, \"Any Which Way You Can\" was a major box office success and ranked among the year's top five highest-grossing films.\nEastwood directed and starred in \"Honkytonk Man\" (1982), based on the eponymous Clancy Carlile's depression-era novel. Eastwood portrays a struggling western singer Red Stovall who suffers from tuberculosis, but has finally been given an opportunity to make it big at the Grand Ole Opry. He is accompanied by his young nephew (played by real-life son Kyle) to Nashville, Tennessee, where he is supposed to record a song. Only \"Time\" gave the film a good review in the United States, with most reviewers criticizing its blend of muted humor and tragedy. Nevertheless, the film received a more positive reception in France, where it was compared to John Ford's \"The Grapes of Wrath\", and it has since acquired the very high rating of 93percent on Rotten Tomatoes. Around the same time, Eastwood directed, produced, and starred in the Cold War-themed \"Firefox\" (also 1982). Based on a 1977 novel with the same name written by Craig Thomas, the film was shot before but released after \"Honkytonk Man\". Russian filming locations were not possible due to the Cold War, and the film had to be shot in Vienna and other locations in Austria to simulate many of the Eurasian story locations. With a production cost of $20\u00a0million, it was Eastwood's highest budget film to that time. \"People\" likened Eastwood's performance to \"Luke Skywalker trapped in Dirty Harry's Soul\".\nEastwood directed and starred in the fourth \"Dirty Harry\" film, \"Sudden Impact\" (1983), which is considered the darkest and most violent of the series. By this time, Eastwood received 60\u00a0percent of all profits from films he starred in and directed, with the rest going to the studio. \"Sudden Impact\" was his final on-screen collaboration with Locke. She plays a middle-aged painter who, along with her sister, was gang-raped years before the story takes place and seeks revenge for her sister's now-vegetative state by systematically murdering the rapists. The line \"Go ahead, make my day\" (uttered by Eastwood during an early scene in a coffee shop) has been cited as one of cinema's immortal lines. It was quoted by President Ronald Reagan in a speech to Congress, and used during the 1984 presidential elections. The film was the second most commercially successful of the \"Dirty Harry\" films, after \"The Enforcer\", earning $70\u00a0million. It received very positive reviews, with many critics praising the feminist aspects of the film through its explorations of the physical and psychological consequences of rape.\n\"Tightrope\" (1984) had Eastwood starring opposite Genevi\u00e8ve Bujold in a provocative thriller, inspired by newspaper articles about an elusive Bay Area rapist. Set in New Orleans to avoid confusion with the \"Dirty Harry\" films, Eastwood played a divorced cop drawn into his target's tortured psychology and fascination for sadomasochism. \"Tightrope\" was a critical and commercial hit and became the fourth highest-grossing R-rated film of 1984. Eastwood next starred in the crime comedy \"City Heat\" (also 1984) alongside Burt Reynolds, a film about an ex-cop turned private eye and his former police lieutenant partner who get mixed up with gangsters in the Prohibition era of the 1930s. The film grossed around $50\u00a0million domestically, but was overshadowed by Eddie Murphy's \"Beverly Hills Cop\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Westerns. A period gone by, the pioneer, the loner operating by himself, without benefit of society. It usually has something to do with some sort of vengeance; he takes care of the vengeance himself, doesn't call the police. Like Robin Hood. It's the last masculine frontier. Romantic myth, I guess, though it's hard to think about anything romantic today. In a Western you can think, Jesus, there was a time when man was alone, on horseback, out there where man hasn't spoiled the land yet.\u2014\u200a\nEastwood made his only foray into TV direction with the \"Amazing Stories\" episode \"Vanessa in the Garden\" (1985), which starred Harvey Keitel and Locke as a married couple. This was his first collaboration with Steven Spielberg, who later co-produced \"Flags of Our Fathers\" and \"Letters from Iwo Jima\". He would revisit the Western genre when he directed and starred in \"Pale Rider\" (1985), a film based on the classic western \"Shane\" (1953) and follows a preacher descending from the mists of the Sierras to side with the miners during the California Gold Rush of 1850. The title is a reference to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, as the rider of the pale horse is Death, and shows similarities to Eastwood's western \"High Plains Drifter\" (1973) in its themes of morality and justice as well as its exploration of the supernatural. It was hailed as one of the best films of 1985 and the best western to appear for a considerable period, with Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" remarking, \"This year (1985) will go down in film history as the moment Clint Eastwood finally earned respect as an artist.\"\nEastwood co-starred with Marsha Mason in the military drama \"Heartbreak Ridge\" (1986), about the 1983\u00a0United States invasion of Grenada. He portrayed a United States Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant veteran of the Vietnam War who realizes he is nearing the end of his military service. Production and filming were marred by internal disagreements between Eastwood and long-time friend and producer Fritz Manes, as well as between Eastwood and the United States Department of Defense, which had expressed contempt for the film. At the time, the film was a commercial rather than a critical success, and has only come to be viewed more favorably in recent times. The film grossed $70\u00a0million domestically.\nEastwood starred in \"The Dead Pool\" (1988), the fifth and final film in the \"Dirty Harry\" series. It co-starred Patricia Clarkson, Liam Neeson, and a young Jim Carrey who plays Johnny Squares, a drug-addled rock star and the first of the victims on a list of celebrities drawn up by horror film director Peter Swan (Neeson) who are deemed most likely to die, the so-called \"Dead Pool\". The list is stolen by an obsessed fan who, in mimicking his favorite director, makes his way through the list killing off celebrities, of which Dirty Harry is also included. \"The Dead Pool\" grossed nearly $38\u00a0million, relatively low receipts for a \"Dirty Harry\" film. It is generally viewed as the weakest film of the series, though Roger Ebert thought it was as good as the original.\nEastwood began working on smaller, more personal projects and experienced a lull in his career between 1988 and 1992. Always interested in jazz, he directed \"Bird\" (1988), a biopic starring Forest Whitaker as jazz musician Charlie \"Bird\" Parker. Alto saxophonist Jackie McLean and Spike Lee, son of jazz bassist Bill Lee and a long time critic of Eastwood, criticized the characterization of Charlie Parker remarking that it did not capture his true essence and sense of humor. Eastwood received two Golden Globes for the film, the Cecil B. DeMille Award for his lifelong contribution, and the Best Director award. However, \"Bird\" was a commercial failure, earning just $11\u00a0million, which Eastwood attributed to the declining interest in jazz among black people. Carrey would appear with Eastwood again in the poorly-received comedy \"Pink Cadillac\" (1989). The film is about a bounty hunter and a group of white supremacists chasing an innocent woman (Bernadette Peters) who tries to outrun everyone in her husband's prized pink Cadillac. The film failed both critically and commercially, earning barely more than \"Bird\" and marking a low point in Eastwood's career.\n1990\u20132009: critical acclaim and awards success.\nEastwood directed and starred in \"White Hunter Black Heart\" (1990), an adaptation of Peter Viertel's \"roman \u00e0 clef\", about John Huston and the making of the classic film \"The African Queen\". Shot on location in Zimbabwe in the summer of 1989, the film received some critical attention but with only a limited release earned just $8.4\u00a0million. Eastwood directed and co-starred with Charlie Sheen in \"The Rookie\", a buddy cop action film released in December 1990. Critics found the film's plot and characterization unconvincing, but praised its action sequences. An ongoing lawsuit, in response to Eastwood allegedly ramming a woman's car, resulted in no Eastwood films being shown in cinemas in 1991. Eastwood won the suit and agreed to pay the complainant's legal fees if she did not appeal.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[I]f possible, he looks even taller, leaner and more mysteriously possessed than he did in Sergio Leone's seminal \"Fistful of Dollars\" a quarter of a century ago. The years haven't softened him. They have given him the presence of some fierce force of nature, which may be why the landscapes of the mythic, late 19th-century West become him, never more so than in his new \"Unforgiven\"... This is his richest, most satisfying performance since the underrated, politically lunatic \"Heartbreak Ridge\". There's no one like him.\u2014\u200a\nEastwood revisited the western genre in \"Unforgiven\" (1992), a film which he directed and starred in as an aging ex-gunfighter long past his prime. Scripts existed for the film as early as 1976 under titles such as \"The Cut-Whore Killings\" and \"The William Munny Killings\", but Eastwood delayed the project because he wanted to wait until he was old enough to play his character and to savor it as the last of his western films. \"Unforgiven\" was a major commercial and critical success; Jack Methews of the \"Los Angeles Times\" described it as \"the finest classical western to come along since perhaps John Ford's 1956 \"The Searchers\"\". The film was nominated for nine Academy Awards (including Best Actor for Eastwood and Best Original Screenplay for David Webb Peoples), and won four, including Best Picture and Best Director for Eastwood. In 2008 \"Unforgiven\" was ranked as the fourth-best American western, behind \"Shane\", \"High Noon\", and \"The Searchers\" in the American Film Institute's \"AFI's 10 Top 10\" list.\nEastwood played Frank Horrigan in the Secret Service thriller \"In the Line of Fire\" (1993), directed by Wolfgang Petersen and co-starring John Malkovich and Rene Russo. Horrigan is a guilt-ridden Secret Service agent haunted by his failure to save John F. Kennedy's life. The film was among the top\u00a010 box office performers in that year, earning $102\u00a0million in the United States alone, and 25 years after he was first listed on Quigley's Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll, Eastwood was voted number one again. A few months after film wrapped, Eastwood directed and co-starred alongside Kevin Costner in \"A Perfect World\" (also 1993). Set in the 1960s, Eastwood plays a Texas Ranger in pursuit of an escaped convict (Costner) who hits the road with a young boy (T.J. Lowther). Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" wrote that the film marked the highest point of Eastwood's directing career, and the film has since been cited as one of his most underrated directorial achievements.\nAt the 1994 Cannes Film Festival Eastwood received France's Ordre des Arts et des Lettres medal, and in 1995, he was awarded the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award at the 67th Academy Awards. His next film appearance was in a cameo role as himself in the children's film \"Casper\" (1995). He expanded his repertoire by playing opposite Meryl Streep in \"The Bridges of Madison County\" (also 1995). Based on the novel by Robert James Waller, the film relates the story of Robert Kincaid (Eastwood), a photographer working for \"National Geographic\" who, while photographing historic covered bridges in Iowa, meets and has an affair with an Italian-born farm wife, Francesca (Streep). Despite the novel receiving unfavorable reviews, \"The Bridges of Madison County\" film was a commercial and critical success. Roger Ebert wrote, \"Streep and Eastwood weave a spell, and it is based on that particular knowledge of love and self that comes with middle age.\" The film was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama and won a C\u00e9sar Award in France for Best Foreign Film. Streep was also nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe.\nEastwood directed and starred in the political thriller \"Absolute Power\" (1997), alongside Gene Hackman (with whom he had appeared in \"Unforgiven\"). Eastwood played the role of a veteran thief who witnesses the Secret Service cover-up of a murder. The film received a mixed reception from critics. Later in 1997, Eastwood directed \"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\", based on the novel by John Berendt and starring John Cusack, Kevin Spacey, and Jude Law. The film met with a mixed critical response.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The roles that Eastwood has played, and the films that he has directed, cannot be disentangled from the nature of the American culture of the last quarter century, its fantasies and its realities.\u2014\u200a\nEastwood directed and starred in \"True Crime\" (1999). He plays Steve Everett, a journalist and recovering alcoholic, who has to cover the execution of murderer Frank Beechum (played by Isaiah Washington). \"True Crime\" received a mixed reception, with Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" writing, \"his direction is galvanized by a sense of second chances and tragic misunderstandings, and by contrasting a larger sense of justice with the peculiar minutiae of crime. Perhaps he goes a shade too far in the latter direction, though.\" The film was a box office failure, earning less than half its $55\u00a0million budget and was Eastwood's worst-performing film of the 1990s aside from \"White Hunter Black Heart\", which had a limited release.\nEastwood directed and starred in \"Space Cowboys\" (2000) alongside Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland and James Garner. Eastwood played one of a group of veteran ex-test pilots sent into space to repair an old Soviet satellite. The original music score was composed by Eastwood and Lennie Niehaus. \"Space Cowboys\" was critically well-received and holds a 79\u00a0percent rating at Rotten Tomatoes, although Roger Ebert wrote that the film was, \"too secure within its traditional story structure to make much seem at risk\". The film grossed more than $90\u00a0million in its United States release, more than Eastwood's two previous films combined. Eastwood played an ex-FBI agent chasing a sadistic killer (Jeff Daniels) in the thriller \"Blood Work\" (2002), loosely based on the 1998 novel of the same name by Michael Connelly. The film was a commercial failure, grossing just $26.2\u00a0million on an estimated budget of $50\u00a0million and received mixed reviews, with Rotten Tomatoes describing it as, \"well-made but marred by lethargic pacing\".\nEastwood directed and scored the crime drama \"Mystic River\" (2003), a film dealing with themes of murder, vigilantism and sexual abuse and starring Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, and Tim Robbins. The film was praised by critics and won two Academy Awards \u2013 Best Actor for Penn and Best Supporting Actor for Robbins \u2013 with Eastwood garnering nominations for Best Director and Best Picture. The film grossed $90million domestically on a budget of $30million. In 2003, Eastwood was named Best Director of the Year by the National Society of Film Critics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Clint is a true artist in every respect. Despite his years of being at the top of his game and the legendary movies he has made, he always made us feel comfortable and valued on the set, treating us as equals.\u2014\u200a\nThe following year, Eastwood found further critical acclaim with \"Million Dollar Baby\". The boxing drama won four Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress (Hilary Swank) and Best Supporting Actor (Morgan Freeman). At age 74, Eastwood became the oldest of eighteen directors to have directed two or more Best Picture winners. He also received a nomination for Best Actor, as well as a Grammy nomination for his score, and won a Golden Globe for Best Director, which was presented to him by daughter Kathryn, who was Miss Golden Globe at the 2005 ceremony. A. O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" lauded the film as a \"masterpiece\" and the best film of the year.\nEastwood directed two films about World War II's Battle of Iwo Jima released in 2006. The first, \"Flags of Our Fathers\", focused on the men who raised the American flag on top of Mount Suribachi and featured the film debut of Eastwood's son Scott. This was followed by \"Letters from Iwo Jima\", which dealt with the tactics of the Japanese soldiers on the island and the letters they wrote home to family members. \"Letters from Iwo Jima\" was the first American film to depict a war issue completely from the view of an American enemy. Both films received praise from critics and garnered several nominations at the 79th Academy Awards, including Best Director, Best Picture, and Best Original Screenplay for \"Letters from Iwo Jima\". At the 64th Golden Globe Awards Eastwood received nominations for Best Director in both films. \"Letters from Iwo Jima\" won the award for Best Foreign Language Film.\nEastwood next directed \"Changeling\" (2008), based on a true story set in the late 1920s. Angelina Jolie stars as a woman reunited with her missing son only to realize he is an impostor. After its release at several film festivals the film grossed over $110\u00a0million, the majority of which came from foreign markets. The film was highly acclaimed, with Damon Wise of \"Empire\" describing \"Changeling\" as \"flawless\". Todd McCarthy of \"Variety\" described it as \"emotionally powerful and stylistically sure-handed\" and that the film's characters and social commentary were brought into the story with an \"almost breathtaking deliberation\". For the film, Eastwood received nominations for Best Original Score at the 66th Golden Globe Awards, Best Direction at the 62nd British Academy Film Awards and director of the year from the London Film Critics' Circle.\nEastwood ended a four-year \"self-imposed acting hiatus\" by appearing in \"Gran Torino\" (also 2008), which he also directed, produced and partly scored with his son Kyle and Jamie Cullum. Biographer Marc Eliot called Eastwood's role \"an amalgam of the Man with No Name, Dirty Harry, and William Munny, here aged and cynical but willing and able to fight on whenever the need arose\". \"Gran Torino\" grossed almost $30\u00a0million during its opening weekend release in January 2009, the highest of his career as an actor or director. \"Gran Torino\" eventually grossed over $268\u00a0million in theaters worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of Eastwood's career so far (without adjustment for inflation).\nEastwood's 30th directorial outing came with \"Invictus\" (2009), a film based on the story of the South African team at the 1995 Rugby World Cup with Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela, Matt Damon as rugby team captain Fran\u00e7ois Pienaar, and Grant L. Roberts as Ruben Kruger. The film was met with generally positive reviews; Roger Ebert gave it three and a half stars and described it as a \"very good film... with moments evoking great emotion\", while \"Variety\"'s Todd McCarthy wrote, \"Inspirational on the face of it, Clint Eastwood's film has a predictable trajectory, but every scene brims with surprising details that accumulate into a rich fabric of history, cultural impressions and emotion.\" For the film, Eastwood was nominated for Best Director at the 67th Golden Globe Awards.\n2010\u2013present: directorial focus and later roles.\nIn the Eastwood-directed \"Hereafter\" (2010), he again worked with Matt Damon, who portrayed a psychic. The film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival and was given a limited theatrical release. \"Hereafter\" received mixed reviews from critics, with the consensus at Rotten Tomatoes being, \"Despite a thought-provoking premise and Clint Eastwood's typical flair as director, \"Hereafter\" fails to generate much compelling drama, straddling the line between poignant sentimentality and hokey tedium.\" Around the same time, Eastwood served as executive producer for a TCM documentary about jazz pianist Dave Brubeck, \"\" (also 2010), to commemorate Brubeck's 90th birthday.\nEastwood directed \"J. Edgar\" (2011), a biopic of FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, with Leonardo DiCaprio in the title role. The film received mixed reviews, although DiCaprio's performance as Hoover was widely praised. Roger Ebert wrote that the film is \"fascinating\", \"masterful\", and praised DiCaprio's performance. David Edelstein of \"New York\" magazine, while also praising DiCaprio, wrote, \"It's too bad \"J. Edgar\" is so shapeless and turgid and ham-handed, so rich in bad lines and worse readings.\" Eastwood starred in the baseball drama \"Trouble with the Curve\" (2012), as a veteran baseball scout who travels with his daughter for a final scouting trip. Robert Lorenz, who worked with Eastwood as an assistant director on several films, directed the film.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Everybody wonders why I continue working at this stage. I keep working because there's always new stories... And as long as people want me to tell them, I'll be there doing them.\u2014\u200a\nDuring Super Bowl XLVI, Eastwood narrated a halftime advertisement for Chrysler titled \"Halftime in America\" (2012). The advertisement was criticized by several U.S. Republicans, who claimed it implied that President Barack Obama deserved a second term. In response to the criticism, Eastwood stated, \"I am certainly not politically affiliated with Mr. Obama. It was meant to be a message about job growth and the spirit of America.\"\nEastwood next directed \"Jersey Boys\" (2014), a musical biopic based on the Tony Award-winning musical of the same name. The film told the story of the musical group The Four Seasons. Eastwood directed \"American Sniper\" (also 2014), a film adaptation of Chris Kyle's eponymous memoir, following Steven Spielberg's departure from the project. Released on Christmas Day, \"American Sniper\" grossed more than $350\u00a0million domestically and over $547\u00a0million globally, making it one of Eastwood's biggest movies commercially. His next film, \"Sully\" (2016), starred Tom Hanks as Chesley Sullenberger, who successfully landed the US Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson River in an emergency landing, keeping all passengers on board alive. It became another commercial success for Eastwood, grossing over $238\u00a0million worldwide. He directed the biographical thriller \"\" (2018), which saw previously non-professional actors Spencer Stone, Anthony Sadler, and Alek Skarlatos playing themselves as they stop the 2015 Thalys train attack. The film received a generally negative reception from critics, who were largely critical of the acting by the three leads. Eastwood next starred in and directed \"The Mule\", which was released in December 2018. He played Earl Stone, an elderly drug smuggler based on Leo Sharp, Eastwood's first acting role since \"Trouble with the Curve\" in 2012. On the eve of \"The Mule\"'s opening, news belatedly surfaced that Eastwood's ex-significant other Sondra Locke had died over a month earlier on November 3; no explanation was given for the media blackout. Given Locke's extensive history of deceiving the public, scholars deduced that she must have requested the blackout in her final wishes, so as to prevent her true age from being broadcast to the world.\nIn May 2019, it was announced that Eastwood would direct \"The Ballad of Richard Jewell\", based on the life of heroic security guard Richard Jewell, who was wrongly suspected in the 1996 Olympic bombing. Later retitled simply \"Richard Jewell\", Eastwood directed and produced the film, through Warner Bros., his tenth straight film with the company. Jonah Hill and Leonardo DiCaprio were originally set to star in the film in 2014, when it was to be directed by Paul Greengrass, but DiCaprio and Hill would ultimately serve only as producers on Eastwood's film. The film stars Paul Walter Hauser in the titular role, along with Sam Rockwell, Kathy Bates, Jon Hamm, and Olivia Wilde in supporting roles. Filming began on June 24, 2019, and \"Richard Jewell\" was released on December 13, 2019.\nIn October 2020, it was announced that Eastwood would direct, produce, and star in \"Cry Macho\", an adaptation of the 1975 novel of the same name, for Warner Bros. Pictures. Production of the film took place in New Mexico between November and December 2020. It was released on September 17, 2021, to mixed reviews and commercial failure.\nIn April 2023, reports emerged that Eastwood would direct and produce \"Juror #2\", from a screenplay by Jonathan Abrams. The film stars Nicholas Hoult, Toni Collette, Zoey Deutch, Kiefer Sutherland, and J.K. Simmons. Production began in June 2023, but was temporarily suspended due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, resuming in November 2023. The film was distributed by Warner Bros. and released in November 2024, to generally favorable reviews. It has been rumored that \"Juror #2\" may be Eastwood's final directorial effort, though insiders deny this.\nDirectorial style.\nBeginning with the thriller \"Play Misty for Me\", Eastwood has directed over 30 films, including Westerns, action films, musicals and dramas. He is one of few top Hollywood actors to have also become a critically and commercially successful director. \"The New Yorker\"'s David Denby wrote that, unlike Eastwood,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;John Ford appeared in just a few silent films; Howard Hawks never acted in movies. Clark Gable, Gary Cooper, Spencer Tracy, James Stewart, Cary Grant, Humphrey Bogart, William Holden, Steve McQueen, and Sean Connery never directed a feature. John Wayne directed only twice, and badly; ditto Burt Lancaster. Paul Newman, Jack Nicholson, Warren Beatty, Robert Redford, Robert De Niro, and Sean Penn have directed a few movies each, with mixed commercial and artistic success.\nFrom the very early days of his career, Eastwood was frustrated by directors' insistence that scenes be re-shot multiple times and perfected, and when he began directing in 1970, he made a conscious attempt to avoid any aspects of directing he had been indifferent to as an actor. As a result, Eastwood is renowned for his efficient film directing and ability to reduce filming time and control budgets. He usually avoids actors' rehearsing and prefers to complete most scenes on the first take. Eastwood's rapid filmmaking practices have been compared to those of Woody Allen, Ingmar Bergman, and Jean-Luc Godard. When acting in others' films, he has sometimes taken over directing, such as for \"The Outlaw Josey Wales\", if he believes production is too slow. In preparation for filming Eastwood rarely uses storyboards for developing the layout of a shooting schedule. He also attempts to reduce script background details on characters to allow the audience to become more involved in the film, considering their imagination a requirement for a film that connects with viewers. Eastwood has indicated that he lays out a film's plot to provide the audience with necessary details, but not \"so much that it insults their intelligence\".\nAccording to \"Life\" magazine, \"Eastwood's style is to shoot first and act afterward. He etches his characters virtually without words. He has developed the art of underplaying to the point that anyone around him who so much as flinches looks hammily histrionic.\" Interviewers Richard Thompson and Tim Hunter commented that Eastwood's films are \"superbly paced: unhurried; cool; and [give] a strong sense of real time, regardless of the speed of the narrative\", while Ric Gentry considers Eastwood's pacing \"unrushed and relaxed\". Eastwood is fond of low-key lighting and back-lighting to give his films a \"noir-ish\" feel.\nEastwood's frequent exploration of ethical values has drawn the attention of scholars, who have researched Eastwood's work from ethical and theological perspectives, including his portrayal of justice, mercy, suicide and the angel of death.\nPolitics.\nEastwood is a former Republican who has sometimes supported Democrats, and has long shown an interest in California politics; he is currently a registered Libertarian.\nHe won election as the nonpartisan mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, in April 1986. He earned $200 per month in that position which he donated to the Carmel Youth Center. While in office, he helped to make ice cream legal to consume on city streets, added public restrooms to the public beach, and a city library annex building was built. He served for two years and declined to run for a second term. In 2001, Governor Gray Davis appointed him to the California State Park and Recreation Commission, and Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger re-appointed him to the commission in 2009.\nEastwood endorsed Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election. He delivered a primetime address at the 2012 Republican National Convention, where he drew attention for a speech he delivered to an empty chair representing President Barack Obama, which he later regretted. On February 22, 2020, Eastwood announced that he would be endorsing Democrat Michael Bloomberg in the 2020 presidential election. Eastwood stated that he wishes that Trump would act \"in a more genteel way, without tweeting and calling people names. I would personally like for him to not bring himself to that level.\"\nMusical interests.\nEastwood is an aficionado of jazz\u2014particularly bebop\u2014and blues, country and western and classical music. He dabbled in music early on by developing as a boogie-woogie pianist and had originally intended to pursue a career in music by studying for a music theory degree after graduating from high school. In late 1959, Eastwood produced the album \"Cowboy Favorites\", released on the Cameo label, which included some classics such as Bob Wills's \"San Antonio Rose\" and Cole Porter's \"Don't Fence Me In\". Despite his attempts to plug the album by going on a tour, it never reached the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\nIn 1963, Cameo producer Kal Mann told him that \"he would never make it big as a singer\". Nevertheless, during the off season of filming \"Rawhide\", Eastwood and Paul Brinegar\u00a0\u2013 sometimes joined by Sheb Wooley\u00a0\u2013 toured rodeos, state fairs, and festivals. In 1962, their act, entitled Amusement Business Cavalcade of Fairs, earned them as much as $15,000 a performance. Although he never made it as a major performing artist, he has passed on the influence to his son, Kyle, who is a professional jazz bassist and composer. An audiophile, Eastwood owns an extensive collection of LPs which he plays on a Rockport turntable. His favorite musicians include saxophonists Charlie Parker and Lester Young, pianists Thelonious Monk, Oscar Peterson, Dave Brubeck, and Fats Waller, and Delta bluesman Robert Johnson.\nEastwood has his own Warner Bros. Records-distributed imprint, Malpaso Records, as part of his deal with Warner Brothers. This deal was unchanged when Warner Music Group was sold by Time Warner to private investors. Malpaso Records, which has released all of the scores of Eastwood's films from \"The Bridges of Madison County\" onward, has also released the album of a 1996 jazz concert he hosted, titled \"Eastwood after Hours \u2013 Live at Carnegie Hall\". He composed the film scores of \"Mystic River\", \"Million Dollar Baby\", \"Flags of Our Fathers\", \"Grace Is Gone\", \"Changeling\", \"Hereafter\", \"J. Edgar\", and the original piano compositions for \"In the Line of Fire\". He wrote and performed the song heard over the credits of \"Gran Torino\" and also co-wrote \"Why Should I Care\" with Linda Thompson and Carole Bayer Sager, a song recorded in 1999 by Diana Krall.\nThe music in \"Grace Is Gone\" received two Golden Globe nominations by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for the 65th Golden Globe Awards. Eastwood was nominated for Best Original Score, while the song \"Grace is Gone\" with music by Eastwood and lyrics by Carole Bayer Sager was nominated for Best Original Song. It won the Satellite Award for Best Song at the 12th Satellite Awards. \"Changeling\" was nominated for Best Score at the 14th Critics' Choice Awards, Best Original Score at the 66th Golden Globe Awards, and Best Music at the 35th Saturn Awards. On September 22, 2007, Eastwood was awarded an honorary Doctor of Music degree from the Berklee College of Music at the Monterey Jazz Festival, on which he serves as an active board member. Upon receiving the award he gave a speech claiming, \"It's one of the great honors I'll cherish in this lifetime.\"\nThe scoring stage at Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank was renamed the Eastwood Scoring Stage in the 1990s.\nPersonal life.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Verified children of Clint Eastwood\nRelationships and children.\nTwice divorced, Eastwood has had numerous casual and serious relationships of varying length and intensity over his life, many of which overlapped. He has eight known children by six women, only half of whom were contemporaneously acknowledged. Eastwood refuses to confirm his exact number of offspring, and there have been wide discrepancies in the media regarding the number. He is closed to discussing his families with the media, stating, \"they're vulnerable people. I can protect myself, but they can't.\" His biographer, Patrick McGilligan, has stated on camera that Eastwood's total number of children is indeterminate and that \"one was when he was still in high school\".\nEastwood's first marriage was to manufacturing secretary-turned-fitness instructor Margaret Neville Johnson in December 1953, having met her on a blind date the previous May. During the courtship, he had an affair that resulted in his daughter Laurie (born 1954), who was adopted by Clyde and Helen Warren of Seattle. While the identity of Laurie's biological mother is not public record, McGilligan said the mother belonged to a theater group Eastwood participated in. Eastwood continued having affairs while married to Johnson, including a 1959 to 1973 liaison with stuntwoman Roxanne Tunis that produced a daughter, Kimber (born 1964). Tunis and Eastwood would keep up a \"healthy relationship\" until her death in 2023.\nJohnson tolerated the open marriage with Eastwood, and eventually they had two children, Kyle (born 1968) and Alison (born 1972). In 1975, Eastwood and married actress-director Sondra Locke began living together; she had been in a marriage of convenience since 1967 with Gordon Leigh Anderson, an unemployed homosexual. Locke claimed that Eastwood sang \"She Made Me Monogamous\" to her and confided he had \"never been in love before\". Fritz Manes, who knew Eastwood since junior high, described the relationship with Locke as \"absolute total, blind love.\" Eastwood finally divorced Johnson in 1984; Locke, however, would remain married to Anderson until her death in 2018. According to Bill Brown, publisher of the \"Carmel Pine Cone\", Eastwood considered Locke the love of his life, yet he has never addressed her death.\nIn an unpublicized affair, Eastwood sired two legally fatherless children, Scott (born 1986) and Kathryn (born 1988) with Jacelyn Reeves, a flight attendant. When Locke and Eastwood separated in 1989, Locke filed a palimony lawsuit and later sued for fraud, reaching a settlement in both cases. During the early-to-mid-1990s, Eastwood had a relationship with actress Frances Fisher that yielded a daughter, Francesca (born 1993). Eastwood was married for the second time in 1996 to news anchor Dina Ruiz, who gave birth to their daughter Morgan that same year. Ruiz and Eastwood's marriage lasted until 2014.\nBeginning 2014, Eastwood was seen in company with restaurant hostess Christina Sandera, though neither publicly confirmed a romance. Eastwood's spokespeople, managers, and press agents have long denied any knowledge of his personal life. Sandera died of a heart attack in July 2024, aged 61. By the fall of that year, Eastwood was in a new relationship, though his girlfriend has not been identified.\nHealth and leisure activities.\nEastwood has been a health and fitness fanatic since his teens. During the production of \"Rawside\", Eastwood featured in magazines and journals, which often documented his health-conscious lifestyle. In an August 1959 edition of \"TV Guide\", for example, Eastwood was photographed doing push-ups. He gave tips on fitness and nutrition, telling people to eat plenty of fruit and raw vegetables, take vitamins, and avoid sugar-loaded beverages, excessive alcohol, and overloading on carbohydrates.\nEastwood's father's death from a heart attack at the age of 64 in 1970, described by Fritz Manes as \"the only bad thing that ever happened to him in his life\", came as a shock to Eastwood, since his grandfather had lived to be 92. It had a profound impact on his life; from then on he became more productive, working with greater speed and efficiency on set, and adopted an even more rigorous health regimen. Despite abstaining from hard liquor, he co-opened an old English-inspired pub called the Hog's Breath Inn in Carmel-by-the-Sea in 1971. Eastwood eventually sold the pub in 1999 and now owns the Mission Ranch Hotel and Restaurant, also located in Carmel-by-the-Sea.\nEastwood is an avid golfer and owns the Teh\u00e0ma Golf Club. He is an investor in the world-renowned Pebble Beach Golf Links west of Carmel and donates his time to charitable causes at major tournaments. Eastwood is an FAA-licensed fixed wing and rotary craft private pilot and often flies his helicopter to the studios to avoid traffic.\nSpiritual beliefs and meditation.\nIn 1973, Eastwood told the film critic Gene Siskel, \"No, I don't believe in God.\" In 2023, his daughter Kathryn stated, \"Most of my earthly family do not believe in or worship God. They either have a lack of faith or reject the god in the Bible in favor of other idols or ideas.\" Eastwood has said that he finds spirituality in nature (as suggested by his Western, \"Pale Rider\", 1985), stating that \"I was born during the Depression and I was brought up with no specific church. We moved every four or five months during the first 14 years of my life, so I was sent to a different church depending on wherever we lived. Most of them were Protestant, but I went to other churches because my parents wanted me to try to figure out things for myself. They always said, 'I just want to expose you to some religious order and see if that's something you like'. So although my religious training was not really specific, I do feel spiritual things. If I stand on the side of the Grand Canyon and look down, it moves me in some way.\"\nHe has also said: \"It would be wonderful to talk with my parents again, who are, of course, deceased. It makes the idea of death much less scary. But then again, if you think that nothing happens after you die, maybe it makes you live life better. Maybe you're supposed to do the best you can by the gift you're given of life and that alone.\"\nIn 1975, Eastwood publicly proclaimed his participation in Transcendental Meditation when he appeared on \"The Merv Griffin Show\" with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the founder of Transcendental Meditation. He has meditated every morning for years.\nReal estate interests.\nWhile serving in the US Army at nearby Fort Ord, Eastwood developed an interest in Carmel area real estate. With income from his acting career, on December 24, 1967, he bought five parcels totaling of land from Charles Sawyer along Highway 1 near Malpaso Creek, south of the Carmel Highlands.\nIn May 1968, Eastwood and actor James Garner bought of wooded land in Carmel Valley from the Howard Hattan estate for $640,000. The property was across the Carmel Valley Road from the Rancho Ca\u00f1ada Country Club and golf course. Eastwood and Garner donated the undeveloped property to the Housing Authority of the County of Monterey in November 1983 with the stipulation that some of the land be used for senior housing.\nHe named his production company Malpaso Productions. Eastwood later bought another parcel in the Highlands, together totaling (6 parcels). In 1995, Monterey County bought the Malpaso land from him for $3.08\u00a0million and placed a permanent conservation easement on the property. Using the proceeds from the sale, Eastwood bought the Odello Ranch at the mouth of the Carmel River during the same year. He paid to lower the levees along the southern side of the Carmel River to protect the Mission Ranch resort he owned, along with the neighboring Mission Fields residential neighborhood on the north side of the river, both of which were flooded in 1994.\nIn 1997, Eastwood and his former wife Maggie Johnson, acting as the Eastwood Trust, donated of the Odello Ranch property east of Highway 1 to the Big Sur Land Trust along with the associated water rights. On June 28, 2016, Eastwood donated the remaining Odello East land.\nEastwood purchased , known as the Ca\u00f1ada Woods development, immediately east of the Odello Ranch.\nIn 2010, at age 80, Eastwood spent approximately $20\u00a0million to build himself a compound in Carmel-by-the-Sea. His California real estate portfolio also includes a Spanish-style mansion in Bel-Air, the Rising River Ranch near Cassel, an apartment in Burbank, a Desert modern home in La Quinta (sometimes misidentified as Palm Springs), as well as a large but understated house located next door to his longtime primary Bel-Air residence. Eastwood is known to have purchased property in two other states. He owns a house in Sun Valley, Idaho, and a 1.13-acre, oceanfront manor in Kihei, Hawaii. The latter was featured in an episode of the 2012 reality show \"Mrs. Eastwood &amp; Company\".\nEastwood previously occupied homes in Studio City, Sherman Oaks, Tiburon, and Pebble Beach.\nFilmography.\nEastwood has contributed to over 50films during his career as actor, director, producer, and composer. He has acted in several television series, including his co-starring role in \"Rawhide\". He started directing in 1971, and made his debut as a producer in 1982 with \"Firefox\", though he had been functioning as uncredited producer on all of his Malpaso Company films since \"Hang 'Em High\" in 1968. Eastwood also has contributed music to his films, either through performing, writing, or composing. He has mainly starred in western, action, and drama films. According to the box office revenue tracking website Box Office Mojo, films featuring Eastwood have grossed a total of more than $1.81\u00a0billion domestically, with an average of $38.6\u00a0million per film.\nAwards and honors.\nEastwood has been recognized with multiple awards and nominations for his work in film, television, and music. His widest reception has been in film work, for which he has received Academy Awards, Directors Guild of America Awards, Golden Globe Awards, and People's Choice Awards, among others. Eastwood is one of only two people to have been twice nominated for Best Actor and Best Director for the same film (\"Unforgiven\" and \"Million Dollar Baby\") the other being Warren Beatty (\"Heaven Can Wait\" and \"Reds\").\nAlong with Beatty, Robert Redford, Richard Attenborough, Kevin Costner, and Mel Gibson, he is one of the few directors best known as an actor to win an Academy Award for directing. On February 27, 2005, he became one of only three living directors, along with Milo\u0161 Forman and Francis Ford Coppola, to have directed two Best Picture winners. At the age of 74, he was the oldest recipient of the Academy Award for Best Director to date. Eastwood has directed five actors in Academy Award-winning performances: Gene Hackman in \"Unforgiven\", Tim Robbins and Sean Penn in \"Mystic River\", and Morgan Freeman and Hilary Swank in \"Million Dollar Baby\".\nOn August 21, 1984, Eastwood was honored at a ceremony at Grauman's Chinese Theatre to record his hand and footprints in cement. Eastwood received the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1996, and received an honorary degree from AFI in 2009. On December 6, 2006, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and First Lady Maria Shriver inducted Eastwood into the California Hall of Fame located at The California Museum for History, Women, and the Arts.\nIn 2007, Eastwood was presented with the highest civilian distinction in France, L\u00e9gion d'honneur, at a ceremony in Paris. French President Jacques Chirac told Eastwood that he embodied \"the best of Hollywood\". In October 2009, he was honored with the Lumi\u00e8re Award (in honor of the Lumi\u00e8re Brothers, inventors of the Cinematograph) at the inaugural Lumi\u00e8re Festival in Lyon, France. This award honors his entire career and his major contribution to the 7th Art. In February 2010, Eastwood was recognized by President Barack Obama with an arts and humanities award. Obama described Eastwood's films as \"essays in individuality, hard truths and the essence of what it means to be American\".\nEastwood has also been awarded at least three honorary degrees from universities and colleges, including an honorary degree from the University of the Pacific in 2006, an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from the University of Southern California on May 27, 2007, and an honorary Doctor of Music degree from the Berklee College of Music at the Monterey Jazz Festival on September 22, 2007.\nOn February 26, 2009, Eastwood received the Cannes Film Festival's Honorary Golden Palm Award at a private ceremony in Paris.\nIn the same year on July 22, he was honored by Emperor Akihito of Japan with the Order of the Rising Sun, 3rd class, Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon for his contributions to the enhancement of Japan\u2013United States relations.\nEastwood won the Golden Pine lifetime achievement award at the 2013 International Samobor Film Music Festival, along with Ryuichi Sakamoto and Gerald Fried.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCited references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "43375", "revid": "41042136", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43375", "title": "Communitarianism", "text": "Political philosophy\nCommunitarianism is a philosophy that emphasizes the connection between the individual and the community. Its overriding philosophy is based on the belief that a person's social identity and personality are largely molded by community relationships, with a smaller degree of development being placed on individualism. Although the community might be a family, communitarianism usually is understood, in the wider, philosophical sense, as a collection of interactions, among a community of people in a given place (geographical location), or among a community who share an interest or who share a history. Communitarianism is often contrasted with individualism, and generally opposes \"laissez-faire\" policies that deprioritize the stability of the overall community.\nTerminology.\nThe philosophy of communitarianism originated in the 20th century, but the term \"communitarian\" was coined in 1841, by John Goodwyn Barmby, a leader of the British Chartist movement, who used it in referring to utopian socialists and other idealists who experimented with communal styles of life. However, it was not until the 1980s that the term \"communitarianism\" gained currency through association with the work of a small group of political philosophers. Their application of the label \"communitarian\" was controversial, even among communitarians, because, in the West, the term evokes associations with the ideologies of socialism and collectivism; so, public leaders\u2014and some of the academics who champion this school of thought\u2014usually avoid the term \"communitarian\", while still advocating and advancing the ideas of communitarianism.\nThe term is primarily used in two senses:\nCzech and Slovak philosophers like Marek Hrubec, and Lubo\u0161 Blaha extend communitarianism to social projects tied to the values and significance of community or collectivism and to various types of communism and socialism (Christian, scientific, or utopian), including:\nOrigins.\nWhile the term communitarian was coined only in the mid-nineteenth century, ideas that are communitarian in nature appeared much earlier. They are found in some classical socialist doctrines (e.g. writings about the early commune and about workers' solidarity), and further back in the New Testament. Communitarianism has been traced back to early monasticism.\nA number of early sociologists had strongly communitarian elements in their work, such as Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies in his comparison of Gemeinschaft (oppressive but nurturing communities) and Gesellschaft (liberating but impersonal societies), and Emile Durkheim's concerns about the integrating role of social values and the relations between the individual and society. Both authors warned of the dangers of anomie (normlessness) and alienation in modern societies composed of atomized individuals who had gained their liberty but lost their social moorings. Modern sociologists saw the rise of mass society and the decline of communal bonds and respect for traditional values and authority in the United States as of the 1960s. Among those who raised these issues were Robert Nisbet (Twilight of Authority), Robert N. Bellah \"Habits of the Heart\", and Alan Ehrenhalt (The Lost City: The Forgotten Virtues Of Community In America). In his book Bowling Alone (2000), Robert Putnam documented the decline of \"social capital\" and stressed the importance of \"bridging social capital,\" in which bonds of connectedness are formed across diverse social groups.\nIn the twentieth century communitarianism also began to be formulated as a philosophy by Dorothy Day and the Catholic Worker movement. In an early article the \"Catholic Worker\" clarified the dogma of the Mystical Body of Christ as the basis for the movement's communitarianism. Along similar lines, communitarianism is also related to the personalist philosophy of Emmanuel Mounier.\nResponding to criticism that the term 'community' is too vague or cannot be defined, Amitai Etzioni, one of the leaders of the American communitarian movement, pointed out that communities can be defined with reasonable precision as having two characteristics: first, a web of affect-laden relationships among a group of individuals, relationships that often crisscross and reinforce one another (as opposed to one-on-one or chain-like individual relationships); and second, a measure of commitment to a set of shared values, norms, and meanings, and a shared history and identity \u2013 in short, a particular culture. Further, author David E. Pearson argued that \"[t]o earn the appellation 'community,' it seems to me, groups must be able to exert moral suasion and extract a measure of compliance from their members. That is, communities are necessarily, indeed, by definition, coercive as well as moral, threatening their members with the stick of sanctions if they stray, offering them the carrot of certainty and stability if they don't.\"\nWhat is specifically meant by \"community\" in the context of communitarianism can vary greatly between authors and periods. Historically, communities have been small and localized. However, as the reach of economic and technological forces extended, more expansive communities became necessary to provide effective normative and political guidance to these forces, prompting the rise of national communities in Europe in the 17th century. Since the late 20th century there has been some growing recognition that the scope of even these communities is too limited, as many challenges that people now face, such as the threat of nuclear war and that of global environmental degradation and economic crises, cannot be handled on a national basis. This has led to the quest for more encompassing communities, such as the European Union. Whether truly supra-national communities can be developed is far from clear.\nMore modern communities can take many different forms, but are often limited in scope and reach. For example, members of one residential community are often also members of other communities \u2013 such as work, ethnic, or religious ones. As a result, modern community members have multiple sources of attachments, and if one threatens to become overwhelming, individuals will often pull back and turn to another community for their attachments. Thus, communitarianism is the reaction of some intellectuals to the problems of Western society, an attempt to find flexible forms of balance between the individual and society, the autonomy of the individual and the interests of the community, between the common good and freedom, rights, and duties.\nAcademic communitarianism.\nWhereas the classical liberalism of the Enlightenment can be viewed as a reaction to centuries of authoritarianism, oppressive government, overbearing communities, and rigid dogma, modern communitarianism can be considered a reaction to excessive individualism, understood as an undue emphasis on individual rights, leading people to become selfish or egocentric.\nThe close relation between the individual and the community was discussed on a theoretical level by Michael Sandel and Charles Taylor, among other academic communitarians, in their criticisms of philosophical liberalism, especially the work of the American liberal theorist John Rawls and that of the German Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant. They argued that contemporary liberalism failed to account for the complex set of social relations that all individuals in the modern world are a part of. Liberalism is rooted in an untenable ontology that posits the existence of generic individuals and fails to account for social embeddedness. To the contrary, they argued, there are no generic individuals but rather only Germans or Russians, Berliners or Muscovites, or members of some other particularistic community. Because individual identity is partly constructed by culture and social relations, there is no coherent way of formulating individual rights or interests in abstraction from social contexts. Thus, according to these communitarians, there is no point in attempting to found a theory of justice on principles decided behind Rawls' veil of ignorance, because individuals cannot exist in such an abstracted state, even in principle.\nAcademic communitarians also contend that the nature of the political community is misunderstood by liberalism. Where liberal philosophers described the polity as a neutral framework of rules within which a multiplicity of commitments to moral values can coexist, academic communitarians argue that such a thin conception of political community was both empirically misleading and normatively dangerous. Good societies, these authors believe, rest on much more than neutral rules and procedures\u2014they rely on a shared moral culture. Some academic communitarians argued even more strongly on behalf of such particularistic values, suggesting that these were the only kind of values which matter and that it is a philosophical error to posit any truly universal moral values.\nIn addition to Charles Taylor and Michael Sandel, other thinkers sometimes associated with academic communitarianism include Michael Walzer, Alasdair MacIntyre, Seyla Benhabib, Shlomo Avineri, and Patrick J. Deneen.\nSocial capital.\nBeginning in the late 20th century, many authors began to observe a deterioration in the social networks of the United States. In the book \"Bowling Alone\", Robert Putnam observed that nearly every form of civic organization has undergone drops in membership exemplified by the fact that, while more people are bowling than in the 1950s, there are fewer bowling leagues.\nThis results in a decline in \"social capital\", described by Putnam as \"the collective value of all 'social networks' and the inclinations that arise from these networks to do things for each other\". According to Putnam and his followers, social capital is a key component to building and maintaining democracy.\nCommunitarians seek to bolster social capital and the institutions of civil society. The Responsive Communitarian Platform described it thus:\nMany social goals require partnerships between public and private groups. Though the government should not seek to replace local communities, it may need to empower them by strategies of support, including revenue-sharing and technical assistance. There is a great need for study and experimentation with creative use of the structures of civil society, and public-private cooperation, especially where the delivery of health, educational and social services are concerned.\nPositive rights.\nImportant to some supporters of communitarian philosophy is the concept of positive rights, which are rights or guarantees to certain things. These may include state-subsidized education, state-subsidized housing, a safe and clean environment, universal health care, and even the right to a job with the concomitant obligation of the government or individuals to provide one. To this end, communitarians generally support social security programs, public works programs, and laws limiting such things as pollution.\nA common objection is that by providing such rights, communitarians violate the negative rights of the citizens; rights to \"not\" have something done for you. For example, taxation to pay for such programs as described above dispossesses individuals of property. Proponents of positive rights, by attributing the protection of negative rights to the society rather than the government, respond that individuals would not have any rights in the absence of societies\u2014a central tenet of communitarianism\u2014and thus have a responsibility to give something back to it. Some have viewed this as a negation of natural rights. However, what is or is not a \"natural right\" is a source of contention in modern politics, as well as historically; for example, whether or not universal health care, private property or protection from polluters can be considered a birthright.\nAlternatively, some agree that negative rights may be violated by a government action, but argue that it is justifiable if the positive rights protected outweigh the negative rights lost.\nStill, other communitarians question the very idea of natural rights and their place in a properly functioning community. They claim that instead, claims of rights and entitlements create a society unable to form cultural institutions and grounded social norms based on shared values. Rather, the liberalist claim to individual rights leads to a morality centered on individual emotivism, as ethical issues can no longer be solved by working through common understandings of the good. The worry here is that not only is society individualized, but so are moral claims.\nResponsive communitarianism movement.\nIn the early 1990s, in response to the perceived breakdown in the moral fabric of society engendered by excessive individualism, Amitai Etzioni and William A. Galston began to organize working meetings to think through communitarian approaches to key societal issues. This ultimately took the communitarian philosophy from a small academic group, introduced it into public life, and recast its philosophical content.\nDeeming themselves \"responsive communitarians\" in order to distinguish the movement from authoritarian communitarians, Etzioni and Galston, along with a varied group of academics (including Mary Ann Glendon, Thomas A. Spragens, James Fishkin, Benjamin Barber, Hans Joas, Philip Selznick, and Robert N. Bellah, among others) drafted and published The Responsive Communitarian Platform based on their shared political principles, and the ideas in it were eventually elaborated in academic and popular books and periodicals, gaining thereby a measure of political currency in the West. Etzioni later formed the Communitarian Network to study and promote communitarian approaches to social issues and began publishing a quarterly journal, \"The Responsive Community\".\nThe main thesis of responsive communitarianism is that people face two major sources of normativity: that of the common good and that of autonomy and rights, neither of which in principle should take precedence over the other. This can be contrasted with other political and social philosophies which derive their core assumptions from one overarching principle (such as liberty/autonomy for libertarianism). It further posits that a good society is based on a carefully crafted balance between liberty and social order, between individual rights and personal responsibility, and between pluralistic and socially established values.\nResponsive communitarianism stresses the importance of society and its institutions above and beyond that of the state and the market, which are often the focus of other political philosophies. It also emphasizes the key role played by socialization, moral culture, and informal social controls rather than state coercion or market pressures. It provides an alternative to liberal individualism and a major counterpoint to authoritarian communitarianism by stressing that strong rights presume strong responsibilities and that one should not be neglected in the name of the other.\nFollowing standing sociological positions, communitarians assume that the moral character of individuals tends to degrade over time unless that character is continually and communally reinforced. They contend that a major function of the community, as a building block of moral infrastructure, is to reinforce the character of its members through the community's \"moral voice\", defined as the informal sanction of others, built into a web of informal affect-laden relationships, which communities provide.\nInfluence.\nResponsive communitarians have been playing a considerable public role, presenting themselves as the founders of a different kind of environmental movement, one dedicated to shoring up society (as opposed to the state) rather than nature. Like environmentalism, communitarianism appeals to audiences across the political spectrum, although it has found greater acceptance with some groups than others.\nAlthough communitarianism is a small philosophical school, it has had considerable influence on public dialogues and politics. There are strong similarities between communitarian thinking and the Third Way, the political thinking of centrist Democrats in the United States, and the Neue Mitte in Germany. Communitarianism played a key role in Tony Blair's remaking of the British socialist Labour Party into \"New Labour\" and a smaller role in President Bill Clinton's campaigns. Other politicians have echoed key communitarian themes, such as Hillary Clinton, who has long held that to raise a child takes not just parents, family, friends and neighbors, but a whole \"village\".\nIt has also been suggested that the compassionate conservatism espoused by President Bush during his 2000 presidential campaign was a form of conservative communitarian thinking, although he did not implement it in his policy program. Cited policies have included economic and rhetorical support for education, volunteerism, and community programs, as well as a social emphasis on promoting families, character education, traditional values, and faith-based projects.\nPresident Barack Obama gave voice to communitarian ideas and ideals in his book \"The Audacity of Hope\", and during the 2008 presidential election campaign he repeatedly called upon Americans to \"ground our politics in the notion of a common good,\" for an \"age of responsibility,\" and for foregoing identity politics in favor of community-wide unity building. However, for many in the West, the term communitarian conjures up authoritarian and collectivist associations, so many public leaders \u2013 and even several academics considered champions of this school \u2013 avoid the term while embracing and advancing its ideas.\nReflecting the dominance of liberal and conservative politics in the United States, no major party and few elected officials openly advocate communitarianism. Thus there is no consensus on individual policies, but some that most communitarians endorse have been enacted. Nonetheless, there is a small faction of communitarians within the Democratic Party; prominent communitarians include Bob Casey Jr., Joe Donnelly, and Claire McCaskill. Many communitarian Democrats are part of the Blue Dog Coalition. It is quite possible that the United States' right-libertarian ideological underpinnings have suppressed major communitarian factions from emerging.\nDana Milbank, writing in \"The Washington Post\", remarked of modern communitarians, \"There is still no such thing as a card-carrying communitarian, and therefore no consensus on policies. Some, such as John DiIulio and outside Bush adviser Marvin Olasky, favor religious solutions for communities, while others, like Etzioni and Galston, prefer secular approaches.\"\nIn August 2011, the right-libertarian \"Reason Magazine\" worked with the Rupe organization to survey 1,200 Americans by telephone. The Reason-Rupe poll found that \"Americans cannot easily be bundled into either the 'liberal' or 'conservative' groups\". Specifically, 28% expressed conservative views, 24% expressed libertarian views, 20% expressed communitarian views, and 28% expressed liberal views. The margin of error was \u00b13.\nA similar Gallup survey in 2011 included possible centrist/moderate responses. That poll reported that 17% expressed conservative views, 22% expressed libertarian views, 20% expressed communitarian views, 17% expressed centrist views, and 24% expressed liberal views. The organization used the terminology \"the bigger the better\" to describe communitarianism.\nThe Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, founded and led by Imran Khan, is considered the first political party in the world which has declared communitarianism as one of their official ideologies.\nComparison to other political philosophies.\nEarly communitarians were charged with being, in effect, social conservatives. However, many contemporary communitarians, especially those who define themselves as responsive communitarians, fully realize and often stress that they do not seek to return to traditional communities, with their authoritarian power structure, rigid stratification, and discriminatory practices against minorities and women. Responsive communitarians seek to build communities based on open participation, dialogue, and truly shared values. Linda McClain, a critic of communitarians, recognizes this feature of the responsive communitarians, writing that some communitarians do \"recognize the need for careful evaluation of what is good and bad about [any specific] tradition and the possibility of severing certain features . . . from others.\" And R. Bruce Douglass writes, \"Unlike conservatives, communitarians are aware that the days when the issues we face as a society could be settled on the basis of the beliefs of a privileged segment of the population have long since passed.\"\nOne major way the communitarian position differs from the social conservative one is that although communitarianism's ideal \"good society\" reaches into the private realm, it seeks to cultivate only a limited set of core virtues through an organically developed set of values rather than having an expansive or holistically normative agenda given by the state. For example, American society favors being religious over being atheist, but is rather neutral with regard to which particular religion a person should follow. There are no state-prescribed dress codes, \"correct\" number of children to have, or places one is expected to live, etc. In short, a key defining characteristic of the ideal communitarian society is that in contrast to a liberal state, it creates shared formulations of the good, but the scope of this good is much smaller than that advanced by authoritarian societies.\"\nCriticism.\nLiberal theorists, such as Simon Caney, disagree that philosophical communitarianism has any interesting criticisms to make of liberalism. They reject the communitarian charges that liberalism neglects the value of community, and holds an \"atomized\" or asocial view of the self.\nAccording to Peter Sutch the principal criticisms of communitarianism are:\nOther critics emphasize close relation of communitarianism to neoliberalism and new policies of dismantling the welfare state institutions through development of the third sector.\nList of communitarian philosophers.\nEarlier theorists and writers\nContemporary theorists\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "43376", "revid": "10004788", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43376", "title": "Boston Celtics", "text": "American professional basketball team\nThe Boston Celtics ( ) are an American professional basketball team based in Boston. The Celtics compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference. Founded in 1946 as one of the league's original eight teams, the Celtics play their home games at TD Garden, a shared arena with the NHL's Boston Bruins. The Celtics are commonly regarded as the most successful team in NBA history. They hold the records for most NBA championships won, with 18, and most recorded wins of any NBA franchise.\nThe Celtics' rise to dominance began in the late 1950s, after the team, led by coach Red Auerbach, acquired Bill Russell in 1956, later becoming the cornerstone of the Celtics dynasty. Led by Russell, Bob Cousy, and Tom Heinsohn, the Celtics won their first NBA championship in 1957. Russell, along with a talented supporting cast of future Hall of Famers including Heinsohn, Don Nelson, K. C. Jones, John Havlicek, Sam Jones, Satch Sanders, and Bill Sharman, would usher the Celtics into the greatest period in franchise history, winning eight consecutive NBA championships from 1959 to 1966. After Russell became the team's player-coach, as well as the first African American head coach in any United States sport, they won back-to-back titles in 1968 and 1969. The Celtics entered a period of rebuilding after Russell retired in 1969.\nIn the mid-1970s, the Celtics became contenders once again, winning championships in 1974 and 1976 under the leadership of head coach Tom Heinsohn with Dave Cowens, Havlicek, and Jo Jo White. In the 1980s, the Celtics returned to dominance. Anchored by the \"Big Three\" of Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, and Robert Parish, the team experienced a renewed rivalry with the \"Showtime\" Lakers and won championships in 1981, 1984, and 1986, the latter two with head coach K. C. Jones. After the retirements of Bird and McHale, the departure of Parish, and the untimely deaths of 1986 draft pick Len Bias and star player Reggie Lewis, the Celtics struggled through the 1990s and much of the early 2000s.\nAfter another period of rebuilding, the Celtics assembled a new \"Big Three\" around team captain Paul Pierce by acquiring Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett in the 2007 offseason. Under the leadership of head coach Doc Rivers, the team defeated the Lakers to win their 17th championship in 2008, while also losing to the Lakers in the 2010 Finals. Allen, Garnett, and Pierce were no longer with the team by the start of the 2013\u201314 season, with Garnett and Pierce being traded to the Brooklyn Nets for four total future first round picks. With two of these first round picks, the team drafted Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Led by \"The Jays\", the team returned to the NBA Finals in 2022, losing to the Golden State Warriors, and defeated the Dallas Mavericks in 2024 to secure their 18th championship.\nThe \"Celtics\" nickname and the team's mascot \"Lucky the Leprechaun\" are nods to Boston's historically large Irish population, and also to the Original Celtics, a barnstorming basketball team that played in the early 20th century. The Celtics have a notable rivalry with the Los Angeles Lakers, who are second in NBA history with 17 championships. The teams' rivalry was especially pronounced in the 1960s and 1980s. The Celtics have played the Lakers a record 12 times in the NBA Finals and have defeated them nine times. 41 members of Basketball Hall of Fame have played for the Celtics at least once in their careers. Four Celtics players (Bob Cousy, Bill Russell, Dave Cowens and Larry Bird) have won the NBA Most Valuable Player award; overall, Celtics players have won an NBA-record 10 MVP awards.\nIn May 2025, the team was sold to private equity investor William Chisholm for $6.1 billion, making it the highest ever valued transaction for a sports franchise in North America. However, the Celtics\u2019 record was surpassed later in 2025 when the Los Angeles Lakers were valued at approximately $10\u202fbillion in the sale of a majority stake\u2014making the Celtics\u2019 deal the second-highest valued sports franchise transaction in U.S. history.\nHistory.\n1946\u20131950: Early years.\nThe Boston Celtics were formed on June 6, 1946, by Boston Garden-Arena Corporation president Walter A. Brown as a team in the Basketball Association of America. In 1948, the team earned its first playoff appearance, only to lose to the Chicago Stags 4\u20131. In 1949, the team missed the playoffs, fifth in the Eastern Division. Then, on August 3, 1949, the team became part of the National Basketball Association following the merger of the BAA and rival National Basketball League. In 1950, the Celtics signed Chuck Cooper, becoming the first NBA franchise to draft a black player. Chuck Connors of \"The Rifleman\" fame was an original member of the Celtics in 1946.\n1950\u20131958: Arrival of Bob Cousy and Red Auerbach.\nThe Celtics struggled during their early years, until the hiring of coach Red Auerbach. In the franchise's early days, Auerbach had no assistants, ran all the practices, did all the scouting\u2014both of opposing teams and college draft prospects\u2014and scheduled all road trips. One of the first great players to join the Celtics was Bob Cousy, whom Auerbach initially refused to draft out of nearby Holy Cross because he was \"too flashy\". Cousy's contract eventually became the property of the Chicago Stags, but when that franchise went bankrupt, Cousy went to the Celtics in a dispersal draft.\nAfter the 1955\u201356 season, Auerbach made a stunning trade, sending perennial All-Star Ed Macauley to the St. Louis Hawks along with the draft rights to Cliff Hagan for the second overall pick in the draft. After negotiating with the Rochester Royals\u2014a negotiation that included a promise that the Celtics owner would send the highly sought-after Ice Capades to Rochester if the Royals would let Russell slide to No. 2\u2014Auerbach used the pick to select University of San Francisco center Bill Russell. Auerbach also acquired Holy Cross standout, and 1957 NBA Rookie of the Year, Tom Heinsohn. Both Russell and Heinsohn worked extraordinarily well with Cousy, and they were the players around whom Auerbach would build the champion Celtics for more than a decade. With Bill Russell, the Celtics advanced to the 1957 NBA Finals and defeated the St. Louis Hawks in seven games, earning their first NBA title. In 1958, the Celtics again advanced to the NBA Finals, this time losing to the Hawks in 6 games.\n1958\u20131969: Bill Russell era and decade-long dynasty.\nFollowing the acquisition of K.C. Jones in 1958, the Celtics began a dynasty that would last for more than a decade. In 1959, the Celtics won the NBA championship after sweeping the Minneapolis Lakers, the first of their record eight consecutive championships. During that time, the Celtics met the Lakers in the Finals five times, starting an intense and often bitter rivalry that has spanned generations. In 1964, the Celtics became the first NBA team to have an all African-American starting lineup. On December 26, 1964, Willie Naulls replaced an injured Tom Heinsohn, joining Tom 'Satch' Sanders, K.C. Jones, Sam Jones, and Bill Russell in the starting lineup. The Celtics defeated St. Louis 97\u201384. Boston won its next 11 games with Naulls starting in place of Heinsohn. The Celtics of the late 1950s\u20131960s are widely considered one of the most dominant teams of all time.\nAuerbach retired as coach after the 1965\u201366 season and Russell took over as player-coach, which was Auerbach's ploy to keep Russell interested. With his appointment Russell became the first African-American coach in any U.S. pro sport. Auerbach would remain the general manager, a position he would hold well into the 1980s. However, the Celtics' string of NBA titles ended when they lost to the Philadelphia 76ers in the 1967 Eastern Conference Finals. The aging team managed two more championships in 1968 and 1969, defeating the Los Angeles Lakers each time. Russell retired after the 1969 season, effectively ending a Celtics dynasty that had garnered an unrivaled 11 NBA titles in 13 seasons. The team's run of 8 consecutive is the longest championship streak in U.S. professional sports history, with Russell's 11 titles being the most won by an NBA player.\n1969\u20131978: Rebuilding and further success.\nThe 1969\u201370 season was a rebuilding year, as the Celtics had their first losing record since the 1949\u201350 season. However, with the acquisition of Paul Silas and future Hall of Famers Dave Cowens and Jo Jo White, the Celtics soon became dominant again. After losing in the Eastern Conference Finals in 1972, the Celtics regrouped and came out determined in 1973 and posted an excellent 68\u201314 regular season record. But the season ended in disappointment, as they were upset in seven games by the New York Knicks in the Conference Finals. John Havlicek injured his right shoulder in game six and was forced to play game seven shooting left-handed. The Celtics returned to the playoffs the next year, defeating the Milwaukee Bucks in the 1974 NBA Finals for their 12th NBA championship. Boston took a 3\u20132 series lead and had a chance to claim the title on their home court. The Bucks won Game Six in Boston when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar nestled in a hook shot with 3\u00a0seconds left in the game's second overtime, and the series returned to Milwaukee. Cowens was the hero in Game 7, scoring 28 points, as the Celtics brought the title back to Boston for the first time in five years.\nIn 1976, the team won yet another championship, defeating the Phoenix Suns in six games. The Finals featured one of the greatest games in NBA history. With the series tied at two games apiece, the Suns trailed early in the Boston Garden, but came back to force overtime. In double overtime, a Gar Heard turn-around jumper at the top of the key sent the game to a third overtime, at which point the Celtics prevailed. After the 1976 championship and a playoff appearance in 1977, Boston went into another rebuilding phase. In the 1977 NBA draft, the Celtics drafted a young forward from UNC Charlotte named Cedric Maxwell. \"Cornbread\" Maxwell did not contribute much in his rookie season, but he showed promise. Auerbach's job became even tougher following the 1977\u201378 season in which they went 32\u201350 as Havlicek, the Celtics' all-time leading scorer, retired after 16 seasons.\nThe Celtics owned two of the top eight picks in the 1978 NBA draft. Auerbach took a risk by selecting junior Larry Bird of Indiana State with the sixth overall pick, knowing that Bird would stay in college for his senior year but believing that his potential would make him worth the wait. The team retained Bird's rights for one year and signed him soon after he led Indiana State to the NCAA championship game. In 1978, Celtics owner Irv Levin traded franchises with Buffalo Braves owner John Y. Brown Jr. Two weeks before the swap of franchises was made official, details of a six-player trade between the two teams were reported. Boston sent Freeman Williams, Kevin Kunnert, and Kermit Washington to the Braves for \"Tiny\" Archibald, Billy Knight, and Marvin Barnes. The move turned Boston fans against Brown, both because Kunnert and Washington were seen as key pieces of the team's future and because Auerbach publicly stated that he was not consulted about the trade.\n1979\u20131992: Larry Bird era.\nThe relationship between Brown and Auerbach worsened with Brown's decision to acquire Bob McAdoo in February 1979, in exchange for three first-round draft picks that Auerbach had planned to use to rebuild the franchise. Again, Brown made the trade without consulting Auerbach. Auerbach almost left Boston to take a job with the New York Knicks as a result. With public support strongly behind Auerbach, Brown sold the team to Harry Mangurian in 1979 rather than run the risk of losing his famed general manager. The Celtics would struggle through the season, going 29\u201353. Newcomers Chris Ford, Rick Robey, Cedric Maxwell and Nate Archibald failed to reverse the team's momentum.\nLarry Bird debuted for the Celtics during the 1979\u201380 season. With a new owner in place, Auerbach made a number of moves that would bring the team back to prominence. He almost immediately traded McAdoo, a former NBA scoring champion, to the Detroit Pistons for guard M. L. Carr, a defensive specialist, and two first-round picks in the 1980 NBA draft. He also picked up point guard Gerald Henderson from the CBA. Carr, Archibald, Henderson and Ford formed a highly competent backcourt, blending in well with the talented frontcourt of Cowens, Maxwell and Bird. With Bird winning NBA Rookie of the Year honors the team went 61\u201321, a 32-game improvement from the previous season. Playing strong in the playoffs, the Celtics fell to the Philadelphia 76ers in the Eastern Conference Finals.\nAfter the season, Auerbach completed one of the most lopsided trades in NBA history, garnering a pair of future Hall of Famers for a pair of first-round draft picks. Seeking to improve the team immediately, Auerbach sent the team's two first-round draft picks to the Golden State Warriors for both center Robert Parish and the Warriors' first-round pick. He then used the pick the Celtics obtained from Golden State to select University of Minnesota power forward Kevin McHale. The \"Big Three\" of Bird, McHale and Parish played together for the Celtics until 1992, won three NBA championships together, and were later described as the best NBA frontcourt of all time.\nDespite losing center Dave Cowens to retirement late in training camp, the Celtics went 62\u201320 under coach Bill Fitch in 1980\u201381. Once again, the Celtics faced the 76ers in the Eastern Conference Finals, falling behind 3\u20131 before coming back to win Game Seven, 91\u201390. The Celtics went on to win the 1981 NBA championship over the Houston Rockets, with Maxwell being named NBA Finals MVP.\nFollowing the 1981\u201382 season, the Celtics once again met the 76ers in the playoffs. This time, they lost in seven games. In 1983 the Celtics were swept in the playoffs (a first for the franchise) by the Milwaukee Bucks; afterwards, Fitch resigned and the team was sold to new owners led by Don Gaston.\nIn 1983\u201384, the Celtics under new coach K. C. Jones would go 62\u201320 and return to the NBA Finals after a three-year hiatus. Boston came back from a 2\u20131 deficit to defeat the Lakers for their 15th championship. Bird renewed his college rivalry with Lakers star Magic Johnson during this series. After the season, Auerbach officially retired as general manager, but maintained the position of team president. He was succeeded by Jan Volk.\nIn 1985, the Lakers and Celtics met again in the Finals, with the Lakers winning. This was the first time the Lakers had defeated the Celtics in the Finals and the only time the team had won a championship at Boston Garden. During the following off-season, the Celtics acquired Bill Walton from the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for Cedric Maxwell. Walton had been an All-Star and league MVP while leading the Portland Trail Blazers to the 1977 NBA championship, but injuries had hobbled him since. Considered the best passing center in NBA history, he stayed healthy and was a big part of the Celtics' success in 1986.\nThe Celtics won the second pick in the 1986 NBA draft and drafted University of Maryland star Len Bias, one of the most heralded prospects of his era. Bias died 36 hours later of an accidental cocaine overdose. Despite the tragedy, the Celtics remained competitive in 1986\u201387, going 59\u201323 and again winning the Eastern Conference Championship. They were defeated in the Finals by the Lakers in six games.\nIn 1988, the Celtics lost in six games to the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals. Following the season, head coach K.C. Jones retired and was replaced by assistant Jimmy Rodgers. Boston's hopes for 1988\u201389 faded when Bird underwent a procedure to remove bone spurs in his feet early in the season, and the Celtics won just 42 games before a first-round playoff defeat to the Pistons. Bird returned in 1989\u201390 and led the Celtics to a 52\u201330 record. In the playoffs, the Celtics collapsed after winning the first two games in a best-of-five series against the New York Knicks, losing three straight games and the series. After the playoffs, Rodgers was fired and replaced by assistant coach and former Celtics player Chris Ford.\nUnder Ford's leadership, the Celtics improved to 56\u201326 in 1990\u201391, recapturing the Atlantic Division title even though Bird missed 22 games with several injuries. The Celtics again lost to the Pistons in the playoffs. In 1992, a late-season rally allowed a 51\u201331 Celtics team to catch the New York Knicks and repeat as Atlantic Division champions. After sweeping the Indiana Pacers in the first round, the Celtics lost a seven-game Eastern Conference Semifinals series to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Back injuries limited Bird to only 45 regular season games, and just four of ten in the playoffs. After thirteen NBA seasons and a gold medal at the Barcelona Olympics with the Dream Team, continued back trouble led Bird to retire in 1992.\n1993\u20131998: Tragedy and decline.\nThe loss of Bird and the aging of the team's other veteran stars forced coach Chris Ford into rebuilding mode. Hopes centered on 26-year-old Reggie Lewis, a small forward out of Boston's Northeastern University. In the first round of the 1993 playoffs Lewis fainted during Boston's four-game series loss by the Charlotte Hornets. An examination revealed heart problems, but Lewis was able to get doctors to clear him for a comeback. Before he could make it he died of a heart attack while shooting baskets at Brandeis University during the off-season. The Celtics honored his memory by retiring his number 35. With McHale having retired after the Celtics' playoff loss to the Hornets, Boston's original Big 3 era came to an end in 1994 upon Robert Parish's signing with Charlotte. The team collapsed, finishing out of the playoffs with a 32\u201350 mark.\nIn 1994, the Celtics hired former player and legendary towel-waving cheerleader M. L. Carr as the team's new vice president of basketball operations. Working alongside general manager Jan Volk, Carr selected University of North Carolina star Eric Montross with Boston's first-round pick in the 1994 NBA draft. Montross became the new heir apparent in the paint, but failed to develop and was eventually traded. 1994\u201395 was the Celtics' final season in the Boston Garden. The Celtics signed aging Dominique Wilkins as a free agent, who led the team in scoring with 17.8 PPG. Second-year player Dino Ra\u0111a, a power forward from Croatia, added an interior presence the team had been lacking in 1993\u201394. The Celtics made the playoffs, losing to the heavily favored Orlando Magic in four games. In 1995, the Celtics moved from the Boston Garden to the Fleet Center (later TD BankNorth, then TD Garden). Carr fired Chris Ford and took the coaching reins himself. After drafting Providence College star Eric Williams, the Celtics struggled to a 33\u201349 record.\nThings got worse in 1996\u201397 as the Celtics lost a franchise-record 67 games, setting an unwanted NBA record winning only once against other Atlantic Division teams and just fifteen victories overall. In spite of the emergence of 1st-round draft pick Antoine Walker, Carr resigned after the season ended, while Rick Pitino was hired to join the franchise as the team's president, director of basketball operations, and head coach, reportedly on a $70 million ten-year contract. Volk resigned on May 7, 1997. Pitino's appointment as team president was controversial as Auerbach, the incumbent who had filled that role for more than 25 years, first heard about the change from local media. Unfortunately for the franchise, Pitino was not the savior everyone hoped he would be. Auerbach bore the insult of being elbowed out with dignity, even as the team failed to improve.\nThe Celtics received the third and sixth draft picks in the 1997 NBA draft, and used the picks to select a brand new backcourt through Chauncey Billups and Ron Mercer. The young team that lost 67 games the year before was dismantled, with David Wesley, Dino Ra\u0111a and Rick Fox being let go, and Williams traded to the Denver Nuggets for a pair of second round draft picks (Williams would return to the Celtics in 1999 and played for four years). Walter McCarty was also acquired in a trade with the Knicks. With a promising start, upsetting the defending champions Chicago Bulls at home on opening night, and hard play from the youngsters that led to leaderships in turnovers and steals, the team improved its victories from 15 to 36 despite many losing streaks. Billups was subsequently traded to the Raptors during his rookie year, and Mercer was traded to the Nuggets during his third season.\n1998\u20132013: Paul Pierce era.\nThe following year in the 1998 NBA draft, the Celtics drafted Paul Pierce, a college star who had been expected to be drafted much earlier than the Celtics' 10th overall pick. Pierce had an immediate impact during the lockout-shortened 1998\u201399 season, averaging 19.5 points and being named Rookie of The Month in February as he led the league in steals. However, the Celtics continued to struggle as Pitino failed to achieve meaningful success. After Boston lost to the Toronto Raptors on March 1, 2000, on a buzzer-beater by Vince Carter, Pitino delivered the memorable \"walking through that door\" speech, invoking Bird, McHale and Parish, which has been frequently cited over the years as a reality check for organizations wrestling with bygone glory. He resigned in January 2001.\nFollowing the resignation of Rick Pitino, the Celtics saw modest improvement under coach Jim O'Brien. Paul Pierce matured into an NBA star and was ably complemented by Antoine Walker and the other players acquired over the years. While the team was 12\u201321 when Pitino left, O'Brien's record to finish the season was 24\u201324. Following the 2000\u201301 season O'Brien was given the job of head coach on a permanent basis. As a result of numerous trades, the Celtics had three picks in the 2001 NBA draft. They selected Joe Johnson, Joe Forte, and Kedrick Brown. Only Johnson managed to succeed in the NBA, becoming a perennial All-Star after leaving the Celtics.\nThe Celtics entered the 2001\u201302 season with low expectations. The team's success in the latter stages of 2000\u201301 was largely forgotten, and critics were surprised when the team, along with the New Jersey Nets, surged to the top of the Atlantic Division ahead of the Philadelphia 76ers, who were fresh off a trip to the NBA Finals. The Celtics won a hard-fought 5-game series with the 76ers in the first round, 3\u20132. Pierce scored 46 points in the series-clinching game at the Fleet Center. In the Conference Semifinals, the Celtics defeated the favored Detroit Pistons 4\u20131. In their first trip to the Eastern Conference Finals since 1988, the Celtics jumped out to a 2\u20131 series lead over the Nets, after rallying from 21 points down in the fourth quarter to win Game 3, but would lose the next three games to fall 4\u20132.\n2003\u20132007: New ownership and arrival of Doc Rivers.\nIn 2003, the Celtics were sold by owner Paul Gaston to Boston Basketball Partners L.L.C., led by H. Irving Grousbeck, Wycliffe Grousbeck and Steve Pagliuca. The team made it back to the playoffs but were swept by the Nets in the second round, despite bringing Game 4 to double overtime. Before their elimination, the team hired former Celtics' guard Danny Ainge as general manager, moving Chris Wallace to another position in the organization. Ainge believed the team had reached its peak and promptly sent Antoine Walker to the Dallas Mavericks (along with Tony Delk). In return, the Celtics received the often-injured Raef LaFrentz, Chris Mills, Ji\u0159\u00ed Welsch, and a first-round pick in 2004. The Celtics made the playoffs, only to be swept in the first round by the Indiana Pacers, losing all four games.\nThe Celtics were a young team under new coach Doc Rivers during the 2004\u201305 season, having drafted youngsters Al Jefferson, Delonte West and Tony Allen in the 2004 Draft. Yet they seemed to have a core of good young players, led by Pierce and rookie Al Jefferson, to go along with a group of able veterans. The Celtics went 45\u201337 and won their first Atlantic Division title since 1991\u201392, receiving a boost from returning star Antoine Walker in mid-season. The Pacers defeated them in the first round yet again, with the series culminating in an embarrassing 27-point loss in Game 7 at the Fleet Center. After the season Walker was traded again, this time to the Miami Heat. Despite Pierce's career season, in which he averaged career-highs in points (26.8), the Celtics missed the playoffs with a 33\u201349 record, owing largely to a young roster and constant roster shuffling, which saw the likes of Marcus Banks, Ricky Davis and Mark Blount traded for underachieving former first-overall pick Michael Olowokandi and former all-star Wally Szczerbiak.\nThe Celtics continued to rebuild in the 2006 NBA draft. The Celtics selected Kentucky point guard Rajon Rondo, who was to become a key piece in the team's revival. In the second round the Celtics added center Leon Powe. The 2006\u201307 season was a gloomy one for the franchise, starting with the death of Red Auerbach at 89. Auerbach was one of the few remaining people who had been a part of the NBA since its inception in 1946. The Celtics went 2\u201322 from late December 2006 through early February 2007 after losing Pierce to injury, the result of a stress reaction in his left foot. At first, the Celtics received a much-needed boost from guard Tony Allen but he tore his ACL and MCL on a needless dunk attempt after the whistle. The Celtics compiled a record of 24\u201358, second-worst in the NBA, including a franchise-record 18-game losing streak. At the end of the season, the Celtics, with the second-worst record in the NBA, were at least hopeful that they could secure a high draft pick and select either Greg Oden or Kevin Durant to help rebuild the franchise, but the Celtics fell to fifth in the Draft Lottery.\n2007\u20132012: Pierce, Allen, and Garnett \"Big Three\" era.\nIn the summer of 2007, general manager Danny Ainge made a series of moves that returned the Celtics to prominence. On draft night, he traded No. 5 pick Jeff Green, Wally Szczerbiak and Delonte West to Seattle for perennial All-Star Ray Allen and Seattle's second-round pick, which the team used to select LSU's Glen \"Big Baby\" Davis. The Celtics then traded Ryan Gomes, Gerald Green, Al Jefferson, Theo Ratliff, Sebastian Telfair, and a first-round draft pick to the Timberwolves in exchange for superstar power forward Kevin Garnett. These moves created a new \"Big Three\" of Pierce, Allen, and Garnett.\nIn the 2007\u201308 season, Celtics completed the largest single-season turnaround in NBA history. The team went 66\u201316 in the regular season, a 42-game improvement over its 2006\u201307 record. However, the team struggled in the early rounds of the playoffs, needing seven games to defeat the Atlanta Hawks in the first round and another seven to defeat the Cleveland Cavaliers in the conference semifinals. The Celtics then beat the Detroit Pistons in six games in the Eastern Conference Finals, winning two road games.\nFor the 11th time in league history, and for the first time since 1987, the Celtics and the Lakers faced off in the NBA Finals. The Celtics won Game One at home 98\u201388, fueled by strong play by Garnett and Pierce's dramatic comeback from a second-half knee injury. They won Game Two 108\u2013102 despite nearly blowing a 24-point lead in the fourth quarter. As the series shifted to Los Angeles, the Lakers stifled Pierce and Garnett in Game Three and won 87\u201381. However, the Celtics would overcome a 24-point deficit in Game 4 to win 97\u201391, making the largest in-game comeback in NBA Finals history. After again blowing a large lead, the Lakers hung on to win Game 5 103\u201398, sending the series back to Boston. In Game 6, the Celtics overpowered the Lakers, winning 131\u201392 and clinching their 17th NBA title. Paul Pierce was named Finals MVP. With the win the Celtics set a record for most games a team had ever played in a postseason with 26.\nThe 2008\u201309 Celtics started off the season at 27\u20132, the then-best starting record in NBA history. They also had a franchise-record 19-game streak. After the All-Star Break, Kevin Garnett was injured in a loss against the Utah Jazz and missed the last 25 games of the season. Garnett was eventually shelved for the playoffs. The 2009 Celtics still finished with 62 victories, but their playoff run would end against the Magic in the second round.\nIn 2009, with the return of Garnett from injury and the additions of Rasheed Wallace and Marquis Daniels, the Celtics started the season 23\u20135 and at one point had the best record in the NBA. However, Doc Rivers decided to lessen his aging stars' minutes to keep them fresh for the playoffs. As a result, the Celtics sputtered to an even 27\u201327 record the rest of the way and finished the 2009\u201310 regular season with a 50\u201332 record. Despite being the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference, the Celtics managed to make the NBA Finals. Rajon Rondo emerged as a star during postseason play. For the 12th time, the Celtics faced the Lakers in the Finals. After taking a 3\u20132 lead heading into Los Angeles for Game Six, the Celtics appeared poised to win their 18th title. However, starting center Kendrick Perkins suffered a severe knee injury early in Game Six, and the Celtics went on to lose the series in seven games.\nDuring the 2010 off-season, with Perkins expected to be out until February 2011, the Celtics signed two former All-Star centers, Shaquille O'Neal and Jermaine O'Neal. Shaquille O'Neal's presence wound up leading to Perkins' departure: the Celtics were 33\u201310 in games Perkins had missed during the year due to injury and had a 19\u20133 record in games when O'Neal played over 20\u00a0minutes. Consequently, Perkins was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder in February, when the Celtics were 41\u201314 and led the Eastern Conference despite another rash of injuries. Following the trade, however, they proceeded to win only 15 of their final 27 games. They finished with a 56\u201326 record, sliding to the third seed. The 2010\u201311 season still provided three landmarks: The Celtics became the second team to reach 3,000 victories, Paul Pierce became the third Celtic to score 20,000 points (the others are Larry Bird and John Havlicek), and Ray Allen broke the NBA record for most career three-pointers. The 2011 NBA playoffs started with the Celtics sweeping the New York Knicks 4\u20130 in the opening round. In the second round, they were ousted by eventual Eastern Conference champions Miami Heat in five games. Shaquille O'Neal, limited to 12\u00a0minutes in two games of the second round, retired at the end of the season.\nThe Celtics started the lockout-shortened season 0\u20133, as Pierce was out with a heel injury. At the All-Star break, the Celtics were below .500 with a 15\u201317 record. However, they were one of the hottest teams in the league after the break, going 24\u201310 the rest of the year and winning their fifth division title in a row. The Celtics made the playoffs as the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference. In the playoffs, the Celtics faced the Atlanta Hawks in the first round, beating them in six games led by strong play from Pierce and Garnett. In the conference semifinals, the Celtics defeated the 76ers in seven games. The Celtics faced the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals, losing in seven games to the eventual NBA champions.\nThe 2012 off-season started with the Celtics having only six players under contract. While Kevin Garnett was signed to a new contract, Ray Allen signed with the Miami Heat for less money than the Celtics offered; this move brought the five-year \"Big Three\" era to a somewhat acrimonious end. The Celtics finished the season with 41 wins. The Celtics trailed the New York Knicks 3\u20130 in the first round of the 2013 NBA playoffs before losing the series in six games. In Game Six, the Celtics nearly completed a comeback when they went on a 20\u20130 run to cut the lead to four.\n2013\u20132016: Rebuilding years.\nDuring the off-season, head coach Doc Rivers was allowed to terminate his contract. He departed the Celtics to coach the Los Angeles Clippers, and the Celtics received a 2015 unprotected first-round pick as compensation. A few days later, Pierce, Garnett (who waived a no-trade clause), Jason Terry, and D. J. White, were traded to the Brooklyn Nets for Keith Bogans, MarShon Brooks, Kris Humphries, Kris Joseph, Gerald Wallace, and three future first-round draft picks (2014, 2016, 2018), together with the right to swap 2017 first-round picks with Brooklyn. The deal marked the start of a youth movement for the team.\nOn July 3, 2013, the Celtics announced that Brad Stevens, the head coach of Butler University, would replace Doc Rivers as head coach. Halfway through the season, in January, Rajon Rondo made his return and was named the 15th Team Captain in team history, and the team furthered the youth movement by acquiring two draft picks in a three-team trade that sent Jordan Crawford and MarShon Brooks to the Golden State Warriors while the Celtics received the Heat center Joel Anthony. The 2013\u201314 season marked the Celtics' first missed playoffs since the \"Big Three\".\nThe next off-season, the Celtics drafted Marcus Smart with the 6th overall pick and James Young with the 17th overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft, and signed Evan Turner. The 2014\u201315 season had several roster moves, the most prominent being Rondo and rookie Dwight Powell traded to the Dallas Mavericks for center Brandan Wright, forward Jae Crowder, veteran point guard Jameer Nelson, and future picks. A total of 22 players spent time with the Celtics, leading scorer and rebounder Sullinger suffered a season-ending left metatarsal stress fracture, and the team was only tenth in the East with 28 games remaining. However, midseason acquisition Isaiah Thomas helped the team win 22 of their last 34 games, finishing the season with a 40\u201342 record, enough for the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference Playoffs. The Celtics were swept by the second seeded Cleveland Cavaliers in the first round.\nIn the 2015 NBA draft Boston selected Terry Rozier, R.J. Hunter, Jordan Mickey, and Marcus Thornton with the 16th, 28th, 33rd, and 45th selections respectively. During the off-season, the Celtics signed forward Amir Johnson and traded Gerald Wallace and Chris Babb in exchange for Warriors forward David Lee. The Celtics finished the 2015\u201316 NBA season with a 48\u201334 record, earning the fifth seed in the Eastern Conference. They played the fourth seed Atlanta Hawks in the first round of the playoffs. After leading by 3 points in the fourth quarter of Game 1, guard Avery Bradley went down with a hamstring injury, making him sit out for the rest of the series. The Celtics lost the series 4\u20132 to the Hawks, ending their season.\n2016\u2013present: Brown\u2013Tatum era (\"the Jays\").\nIn the 2016 NBA draft, the Celtics selected Jaylen Brown with the third pick. On July 8, 2016, the team signed four-time All-Star Al Horford. The Celtics finished the 2016\u201317 season with a 53\u201329 record and clinched the top seed in the Eastern Conference. After a hip injury ended Thomas' playoff run in game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals, the Celtics eventually lost to the Cavaliers in five games. Isaiah Thomas was selected for his second straight All-Star game and first All-NBA selection, finishing third in the league in scoring and fifth in MVP voting. For the 2017 NBA draft, the Celtics won the draft lottery, earning them the first pick. They were projected to select freshman guard Markelle Fultz, but the pick was subsequently traded to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for the third pick in the 2017 draft and future picks. The 76ers would go on to draft Fultz, while the Celtics used the third pick to select freshman forward Jayson Tatum. During the off-season, the team signed Gordon Hayward. On August 22, 2017, the Celtics agreed to a deal that sent Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, Ante \u017di\u017ei\u0107, and the Brooklyn Nets' 2018 first-round draft pick to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Kyrie Irving.\n2017\u20132019: Kyrie Irving saga.\nBy the end of the off-season, only four Celtics' players remained from the 2016\u201317 team, with Marcus Smart being the longest-tenured Celtic from the 2014 NBA draft. On the team's opening night game in the first quarter against the Cavaliers, Hayward suffered a fractured tibia and dislocated ankle in his left leg, causing him to be ruled out for the rest of the regular season. Despite the loss, the Celtics went on a 16-game winning streak, which also went down as the fourth-longest winning streak in the teams' history. The Celtics finished the year with a 55\u201327 record, good enough for second place in the Eastern Conference. In the playoffs, they defeated the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round in seven games, and continued the feat in the Conference Semifinals by defeating the Philadelphia 76ers in five games before losing to the Cleveland Cavaliers in seven games in the Conference Finals.\nThe Celtics finished the 2018\u201319 season with a 49\u201333 record. Analysts started questioning the team's performance and chances for the championship when the Celtics had a 10\u201310 record after the first 20 games on November 24, 2018. The Celtics then won the next eight games improving their record to 18\u201310. During the eight-game win streak, the Celtics defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 128\u201395, the New York Knicks 128\u2013100, and also defeated the Chicago Bulls by 56 points (133\u201377), setting a record for the largest margin in a victory in franchise history, while also tying the record for largest victory margin by an away team. The Celtics finished the regular season in fourth place in the Eastern Conference. During an April 7 game, Marcus Smart injured his hip and was ruled out for the rest of the regular season and the first round of the playoffs. In the 2019 playoffs, the Celtics swept the Indiana Pacers in the first round, and then lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in five games.\nThe Celtics held four picks in the 2019 NBA draft. Following a series of transactions, the team landed Romeo Langford with the 14th pick and also added Grant Williams, Carsen Edwards, and Tremont Waters (2020 G-league Rookie of the year). During the 2019 off-season, Irving and Horford signed with the Brooklyn Nets and Philadelphia 76ers, respectively. Irving left, despite promising to stay in Boston. On June 30, 2019, the Celtics and point guard Kemba Walker agreed to a four-year maximum contract worth $141 million. On July 6, 2019, the Celtics officially acquired Walker in a sign and trade with the Charlotte Hornets; the Celtics sent guard Terry Rozier and a protected 2020 second-round draft pick to Charlotte in exchange for Walker and a 2020 second-round draft pick. On July 1, 2019, the Celtics agreed to a two-year contract with center Enes Kanter.\n2019\u20132021: Rise of \"the Jays\".\nFollowing the suspension of the 2019\u201320 NBA season, the Celtics were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final 8 games of the regular season. In the 2020 playoffs, the Celtics swept the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round, beat the Toronto Raptors in a seven-game series, and fell to the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals in six games. Boston struggled with injuries in the 2020\u201321 season, with Walker, Tatum and Brown all missing games at different points in the season due to injury and COVID-19. Boston could not automatically qualify for the playoffs and were sent to the play-in tournament, where they defeated the Washington Wizards 119\u2013100. In the playoffs, they lost to the Brooklyn Nets in five games.\n2021\u201322: First Finals appearance for the Jays.\nOn June 2, 2021, the Celtics named head coach Brad Stevens as president of basketball operations replacing Danny Ainge after he announced his retirement. On June 18, Stevens made his first transaction in his new position trading away Kemba Walker, the 16th pick in the 2021 NBA draft, and a 2025 second-round pick in exchange for former Celtic Horford, Moses Brown, and a 2023 second-round pick. On June 23, 2021, it was reported that Stevens had made the decision to hire Ime Udoka as his own replacement as head coach of the Celtics. Tatum made his third All-Star appearance off the bench at the 2022 NBA All-Star Game in Cleveland.\nIn April 2022, the Celtics qualified for the 2022 NBA playoffs as the second seed in the Eastern Conference, having a 51\u201331 record; they swept the Brooklyn Nets in the first round of the postseason. They next faced the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Conference Semifinals and the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals, defeating both teams in seven-game series, earning the Celtics their first Finals appearance since 2010. The Celtics took a 2\u20131 series lead, but lost the next three games to lose to the Golden State Warriors 4\u20132.\n2022\u201323: Conference finals loss.\nIn September, the Celtics suspended Udoka for the whole 2022\u201323 season for engaging in an improper intimate relationship with a female staffer. Assistant coach Joe Mazzulla replaced Udoka as the interim head coach. On February 16, 2023, Mazzulla was named the team's permanent head coach after leading the Celtics to a league-best 42\u201317 record at the NBA All-Star break. After overcoming a 3\u20132 deficit against the Philadelphia 76ers to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals, the Celtics fell behind 3\u20130 in a rematch against the Heat. They battled their way back to Game 7 thanks to a Derrick White buzzer-beater in Game 6, but the Heat ultimately prevented the first 3\u20130 comeback in NBA history with a decisive win in Boston, due to an injury early in the game to Jayson Tatum.\n2023\u201324: 18th championship for Boston.\nDuring the 2023 off-season, the Celtics acquired Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is from the Wizards. In the trade, they sent Marcus Smart to the Memphis Grizzlies in a three-team deal, and also traded Grant Williams to the Dallas Mavericks. On October 1, 2023, the Celtics acquired Jrue Holiday in exchange for Malcolm Brogdon, Robert Williams III and two draft picks. On February 7, 2024, before the trade deadline, the Celtics acquired Xavier Tillman from the Grizzlies.\nThe Celtics finished the 2023\u201324 regular season with the best record in the NBA, securing a 64\u201318 record. After the regular season's close, the Celtics entered the 2024 NBA playoffs, defeating the Miami Heat in the first round, moving on to defeat the Cleveland Cavaliers in the East Semifinals, and moving on again to defeat the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals. The Celtics' victory in the Eastern Conference Finals on May 27, 2024, was accompanied by the announcement that Jaylen Brown had been selected as the NBA Eastern Conference Finals MVP, and Brown was presented with the Larry Bird trophy, the first of his career. The Celtics would go on to defeat the Dallas Mavericks in five games to win the NBA Finals, their record-setting 18th championship and breaking the tie with the Lakers (who currently have 17).\n2024\u201325: Defending their title.\nDuring the 2024\u201325 season, the Celtics clinched another division title. They defeated the Orlando Magic in five games in the first round and then lost to the New York Knicks in the Conference Semifinals of the 2025 playoffs.\nRivalries.\nLos Angeles Lakers.\nThe rivalry between the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers involves the two most storied franchises in NBA history. It has been called the NBA's best rivalry. The two teams have met a record twelve times in the NBA Finals, starting with their first Finals meeting in 1959. They would go on to dominate the league in the 1960s and the 1980s, facing each other six times in the 1960s, three times in the 1980s, in 2008, and in 2010.\nThe Celtics have won the first eight finals meetings, while the Lakers won three of last four.\nThe rivalry had been less intense since the retirements of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird in the early 1990s, but in 2008 it was renewed as the Celtics and Lakers met in the Finals for the first time since 1987, with the Celtics winning the series in six games. They faced off once again in the 2010 NBA Finals which the Lakers won in seven games. The two teams are first and second for the highest number of championships, with the Celtics leading the Lakers, 18 titles to 17; together, their 35 championships account for almost half of the 78 championships in NBA history.\nAtlanta Hawks.\nThe Celtics\u2013Hawks rivalry is a rivalry in the Eastern Conference of the National Basketball Association that has lasted for over five decades, although the two teams have played each other since the 1949\u201350 season, when the then-Tri-Cities Blackhawks joined the NBA as part of the National Basketball League and the Basketball Association of America merger. However, the Blackhawks could not field a truly competitive team until they moved to St. Louis as the St. Louis Hawks after a four-year stopover at Milwaukee. The two teams have faced each other eleven times in the NBA Playoffs, four times in the NBA Finals, with the Celtics winning ten of twelve series against the Hawks, including three out of four NBA Finals. While the Hawks have only defeated the Celtics twice out of eleven series in the NBA Playoffs, they still often managed to make their series with the Celtics memorable. The rivalry intensified in 2016 with Hawks All-Star Center Al Horford spurning the team and joining the Celtics.\nBrooklyn Nets.\nThe Boston Celtics were once rivals of the New Jersey Nets during the early 2000s due to their respective locations and their burgeoning stars. The Nets were led by Jason Kidd and Kenyon Martin, while the Celtics were experiencing newfound success behind Paul Pierce and Antoine Walker. The rivalry began to heat up in the 2002 Eastern Conference Finals, which was preceded by trash-talking from the Celtics who claimed Martin was a \"fake\" tough guy. Things progressed as the series started, and on-court tensions seemed to spill into the stands. Celtics' fans berated Kidd and his family with chants of \"Wife Beater!\" in response to Kidd's 2001 domestic abuse charge. When asked about the fan barbs being traded, Kenyon Martin stated, \"Our fans hate them, their fans hate us.\" Bill Walton said at the time that Nets-Celtics was the \"beginning of the next great NBA rivalry\" during the Eastern Conference Finals in 2002 with the Nets advancing to the NBA Finals, though New Jersey would go on to sweep Boston in the 2003 playoffs. In 2012, the year the Nets returned to New York in the borough of Brooklyn, there were indications that the rivalry might be rekindled when an altercation occurred on the court on November 28, resulting in the ejection of Rajon Rondo, Gerald Wallace, and Kris Humphries. Rondo was suspended for two games in the aftermath, while Wallace and Kevin Garnett were fined. The story was revisited on December 25, when Wallace grabbed Garnett's shorts and the two had to be broken up by referees and players alike. However, the rivalry between the Nets and the Celtics appeared significantly cooled off by the June 2013 blockbuster trade that dealt Celtics stars Garnett and Paul Pierce to the Nets in exchange for Wallace, Humphries, and others. This move was billed as a merger of the two Atlantic Division teams.\nDetroit Pistons.\nThe rivalry between the Celtics and the Detroit Pistons peaked in the 1980s, featuring players such as Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, Robert Parish, Isiah Thomas, Bill Laimbeer, Dennis Rodman, and Joe Dumars. These teams met in the NBA playoffs five times in 7 seasons from 1985 to 1991, with the Celtics winning in 1985 and 1987, and the Pistons coming out on top en route to back-to-back Finals appearances in 1988 and their championship seasons of 1989 and 1990. Led by Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen in the 2008 Eastern Conference Finals the Celtics defeated the Pistons in 6 games to advance to the NBA Finals where they went on to beat the Lakers also in 6 games.\nNew York Knicks.\nThe rivalry between the Celtics and the New York Knicks stems from the location of the teams, both of which are in the NBA's Atlantic division. It is one of many rivalries between Boston and New York teams, most notably the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox in Major League Baseball. Boston and New York are also the only two original NBA franchises that have remained in the same city for the duration of their existence. The teams have played 512 games against each other during the regular season, with the Celtics winning 276 times. The two teams have also faced each other 61 times during the playoffs, with the Celtics winning 34 times.\nPhiladelphia 76ers.\nThe Celtics and the Philadelphia 76ers are the two teams who have the most meetings in the NBA playoffs, playing each other in 22 series, of which the Celtics have won 15. The 76ers are considered the Celtics' biggest rival in the Eastern Conference. The rivalry reached its peak when players Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain of the 76ers played each other from 1965 to 1968. Their play would result in the Celtics not winning every NBA Finals series in the 1960s when the 76ers won in 1967.\nWashington Wizards.\nOne of the most recent and unexpected rivalries that has been created between the Celtics is with the Washington Wizards. Although both teams had engaged in a fight in 1984, the rivalry intensified during the 2015\u201316 season in a January regular season game after Jae Crowder was given a technical foul. Crowder then began to exchange words with then Wizards coach Randy Wittman. It began to escalate that off-season when the Celtics were trying to sign Al Horford. It was publicly reported that Jae Crowder emphasized that the Celtics beat the Wizards in all of their meetings that season and should sign with them rather than Washington. In their first meeting of the 2016\u201317 season, Wall hit Marcus Smart in the back-court when they were up by 20 late in the 4th quarter. Wall was hit with a Flagrant 2 foul and was promptly ejected. Smart immediately got back up and began to scuffle with Wall. Their words continued even after being separated with Wall telling Smart to meet him out back after the game. No incident was reported between the two following the game. In their next meeting, the Celtics won 117\u2013108. However, after the game Wall and Crowder exchanged words in front of the Wizards bench. Crowder ended up trying to jab his finger at Wall's nose and Wall tried to fight back with a slap. Teammates and coaches from both sides had to step in and separate the two teams but the players continued to yell while entering their respective locker rooms. Police officers had to be on guard between the two locker rooms to ensure no further confrontation. Otto Porter is quoted as calling the Celtics as dirty. Isaiah Thomas replied \"If playing hard is dirty, then I guess we are a dirty team.\"\nIn their next game in January, the Wizards wore all black to enter the game. The notion was that it is similar to the attire of a funeral. Their decision worked as they defeated the Celtics 123\u2013108. The two teams would go on to meet in the Conference Semifinals in the 2017 Playoffs. In Game 1, Markieff Morris landed on Horford's ankle after shooting a jumpshot. Morris sprained his ankle and had to miss the rest of the game which was a 123\u2013111 loss. Morris believed that Horford did this intentionally. In Game 2, Morris retaliated by grabbing Horford by the waist and pushed him into the seats. In Game 3, Kelly Olynyk set a hard screen on Kelly Oubre. Olynyk's shoulder hit Oubre in the chin causing him to drop to the floor. Oubre angrily rose and pushed Olynyk down onto the floor. Oubre was then assessed a flagrant 2 foul and was ejected while also being suspended for Game 4. No significant altercations erupted in the rest of the seven-game series in which the Celtics would go on to win. The rivalry has since dissipated as the Celtics have retooled their roster but their match-ups are still seen as significant as they played on Christmas in 2017.\nMiami Heat.\nThe Boston Celtics and the Miami Heat developed an intense rivalry during the 2010s. The two teams were highlighted by their star trios in Boston's Ray Allen, Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce whereas Miami had LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. They first met in the 2010 NBA Playoffs where Boston won the series in 5 games. They would then meet the following year where Miami would end up winning in 5 games. The teams would meet for the third straight year in the 2012 Eastern Conference Finals. Despite Boston holding a 3\u20132 lead, Miami would win the next 2 games to advance to the NBA Finals where they defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder. In the 2020 NBA Bubble, the Miami Heat and Boston Celtics met in the 2020 Eastern Conference Finals where Miami won in 6 games and advanced to the NBA Finals where they were prevented Boston from meeting their longtime rival Los Angeles Lakers. Unfortunately, Miami lost in 6 games to the Los Angeles Lakers. They would meet in the 2022 Eastern Conference Finals where Boston finally beat the Miami Heat in 7 games. It was their first win against Miami since 2010. In the following year, the two met in the 2023 Eastern Conference Finals. Despite Miami taking a commanding a 3\u20130 lead, Boston won the next three games to send the series to 7 games. However, Miami won to avoid earning the distinction of blowing a 3\u20130 lead while also preventing Boston from meeting the Lakers in the Finals. They then met in the 2024 first round where Boston beat Miami in 5 games.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"List of the last five seasons completed by the Celtics. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Boston Celtics seasons.\"\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W\u2013L% = Winning percentage\"\nRecords, retired numbers, and awards.\nThe Celtics have won an NBA-record 18 championships. Forty-eight members of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame are connected to the Celtics, and the franchise has retired 23 jersey numbers, more than any other American sports team. As of December 2023, the Celtics have won more NBA regular season games than any other team.\nHall of Fame.\n37 people were inducted in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as players, 6 \u2013 as coaches, 6 \u2013 as contributors.\nAdditionally, Johnny Most and Mike Gorman were honored with the Hall of Fame's Curt Gowdy Media Award. Most was awarded in 1993 for his 37-year career as the Celtics radio announcer, while Gorman was awarded in 2021 for his 40-year career as the Celtics television announcer.\nNotes:\nFIBA Hall of Fame.\nFIBA, the body which governs international basketball, has selected two players associated with the Celtics to the FIBA Hall of Fame for contributions to international basketball.\nPersonnel.\nRetained draft rights.\nThe Celtics hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player is ostensibly either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends. This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams.\nFranchise leaders.\nBold denotes still active with the team.\n\"Italic\" denotes still active but not with the team.\nPoints scored (regular season) (as of the end of the 2024\u201325 season)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther statistics (regular season) (as of the end of the 2024\u201325 season)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Column/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Column/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCoaches.\nHead coaches.\nThere have been 18 head coaches in Celtics' history. Red Auerbach is the most successful franchise's head coach having won 9 NBA championships with the team. Celtics' legend Bill Russell took coaching duties from Auerbach and led them to 2 NBA championships while playing and coaching at the same time. The other two coaches that won 2 NBA titles with the team are Tom Heinsohn and K. C. Jones. Bill Fitch and Doc Rivers led the Celtics to 1 NBA championship apiece, as has current head coach Joe Mazzulla.\nLogos and uniforms.\nLogos.\nThe Boston Celtics logo features a leprechaun spinning a basketball, named Lucky, originally depicted with a large basketball for a background. It was originally designed by Zang Auerbach, the brother of Celtics head coach Red Auerbach. Through the 1995\u201396 season, the logo's only colors were green, white and black. Then for the 1996\u201397 season, celebrating the club's 50th anniversary, the logo got a full-color treatment. Lucky's face and hands were both painted tan, while gold was included on the vest, bow tie and hat, as well as brown on the ball and shillelagh, and black on its pants and shoes.\nThe Celtics also have various alternative logos, with the most popular being a white shamrock with the letters \"Celtics\" above it, wrapped in a green circle, which has been used since the 1998\u201399 season. The alternate logo is based on logos used by the Celtics before they used the Zang Auerbach leprechaun. For much of its history, the shamrock was trimmed in gold, as seen in the old team warmup jackets. A new secondary logo, unveiled in 2014, featured a variation of the leprechaun logo, in silhouette form.\nUniforms.\nPrimary uniforms.\nFor much of their history, the Celtics wore green uniforms on the road and white uniforms at home. The basic template of the current Celtics' uniforms was formalized in the team's early years, and along the way they made a few adjustments in the lettering and stripes.\nAmong the more notable changes in the uniforms were the switch from serifed to sans-serif block lettering in 1968, the addition of names in 1972, and the incorporation of the three-leaf shamrock logo in 1998. While the white uniforms remained largely intact, the green uniforms have featured either the city name (1950s\u20131965; 2014\u2013present) or the team name (1965\u20132014).\nWhen Nike became the NBA's uniform provider in 2017, they decided to eliminate the \"home\" and \"away\" uniform designations. Thus the white Celtics uniforms became known as the \"Association\" uniforms while the green uniforms became the \"Icon\" uniforms. Both sets are now used regardless of home and road games.\nIn January 2017, the Celtics signed a multi-year deal with General Electric where they became the \"exclusive Data and Analytics partner\" for the team. As part of the deal, GE agreed to pay the Celtics more than $7 million per year to have the uniforms with a GE logo prominently placed on the left shoulder of jerseys in green and white. This was the first time a corporate logo were placed on the game uniforms. Along with the GE logo, the Nike logo now emblazons the right shoulder of the Celtics' uniforms.\nIn November 2020, the Celtics signed a multi-year deal with Vistaprint who became the main jersey sponsor of the team. In July 2024, Amica Mutual Insurance signed on as the team's jersey sponsor.\nAlternate uniforms.\nFrom 2005 to 2017, the Celtics wore alternate green uniforms with black lettering and trim featuring the word \"Boston\" on the front side. One noticeable difference in the alternate uniforms was the black panels with a green shamrock, reminiscent of the original Celtics uniforms worn in the late 1940s. During its run, the green-and-black alternates were considered 'unlucky' by the team whenever they wore them in the playoffs; the Celtics went 0\u20138 in these uniforms.\nA gray uniform set was also used from 2014 to 2017. Dubbed \"Parquet Pride\", the uniforms featured sleeves (a prominent figure in Adidas' NBA uniforms), white letters with green trim, the silhouetted leprechaun logo on the shorts, the shamrock logo on the left leg, and a parquet-like pattern on the sides.\nFor 2017 and beyond, the Celtics will wear black \"Statement\" uniforms (labeled by Nike in reference to the league's third jerseys). The uniform features a black base with \"Celtics\" in green lettering and white trim, and other than a few changes in the striping scheme, the uniform remained essentially the same. Starting in 2020, the \"Statement\" uniform would feature the Air Jordan brand logo, a feature previously exclusive to the Charlotte Hornets uniforms.\nSpecial uniforms.\nBetween 2006 and 2017, the Celtics wore special St. Patrick's Day uniforms. The initial uniforms were worn from 2006 to 2013 and it strongly resembled their regular green uniforms save for gold and white trim and the city name in front. For 2014 and 2015, the uniforms were sleeved, replaced the city name in front in favor of the team name, and now resembled their green/black alternates. In 2016 and 2017, the uniforms were again sleeveless and featured the city name in front, but kept the previous striping.\nDuring the NBA Europe Live Tour prior to the 2007\u201308 season, the Celtics used the alternate road jerseys in their game against the Toronto Raptors in Rome, except that the words \"Boston\" on the front side of the jersey and the shamrock on the shorts and on the reverse side of the jersey contained the green, white and red tricolors of the Italian flag. In the second game in London, the regular road jerseys featured a patch containing the Union Jack.\nAt the 2008\u201309 season opener against the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Celtics wore a modified version of their home uniforms, accented with gold, to commemorate last season's championship team.\nThe Celtics have also worn special edition Christmas Day uniforms since the 2008\u201309 season. For the first four games, they wore their regular green uniforms modified with the NBA logo inside a snowflake. Then in the 2012\u201313 season, they wore monochrome uniforms with green lettering trimmed in white. For the 2016\u201317 season, the Celtics wore a special green uniform with a more ornate script lettering, but without the additional striping.\nStarting with the 2017\u201318 season, the Celtics wore special edition \"City\" uniforms designed by Nike. Their first \"City\" uniforms were in gray and featured a pattern of the parquet floor throughout, a green shamrock with white trim on the left leg, green letters with white trim, Red Auerbach's signature near the uniform tag, and a portion of the 2008 championship banner on the beltline.\nFor the 2018\u201319 season, the Celtics wore white \"City\" uniforms with green letters and shamrocks trimmed in gold. It also has Red Auerbach's signature near the uniform tag and a gold-trimmed alternate Celtics logo on the beltline. In addition, the Celtics wore an \"Earned\" edition uniform exclusive only to the 16 teams that made the 2018 NBA playoffs. Their rendition is a palette swap of the \"City\" uniforms with a green base and gold letters and shamrocks with white trim. Both uniforms were inspired by the team's warmup jackets they wore from the 1950s until 1998, which contained a brighter gold trim.\nThe Celtics' \"City\" uniform for the 2019\u201320 season featured a green base and a stylized \"Boston\" wordmark and numbers in gold with black trim. A Celtic knot in the shape of a shamrock adorn the beltline.\nThe 2020\u201321 Celtics' \"City\" uniform was patterned after the 17 championship banners that adorn the TD Garden rafters. The uniform, which is white with thick green stripes, features the full name in Futura Condensed stacked in front, and Red Auerbach's signature and quote \"The Boston Celtics are not a basketball team. They're a way of life.\" appears above the manufacturer's tag. The Celtics also released a second \"Earned\" uniform after qualifying in the 2020 NBA playoffs; this design features a dark green base with Celtic and lime green striping, and the letters were rendered in Celtic green with white trim.\nThe Celtics' green \"City\" uniform for the 2021\u201322 season was a mix of previous uniform designs. The neck and arm striping was taken from their current uniforms. The green lettering with white drop shadows was a nod to the 1949 uniform design. The gray triangles on the shorts represented the franchise's initial uniforms; the left side contained the team's 75th anniversary emblem, while the right side contained a green-and-white version of the Red Auerbach memorial shamrock used in the 2006\u201307 season. Contrasting nameplates on the back were inspired by the warmup jackets the team used for much of its history, and the original \"jumping leprechaun\" logo from the 1960s was added to the waist. Retired numbers, the Auerbach signature and quotation (see 2021 \"City\" uniform), and 17 shamrocks representing each championship season, surrounded the jock tag.\nThe 2022\u201323 \"City\" uniform served as a memorial to Bill Russell, who died on July 31. The uniform is dark green with metallic gold and black accents, and has the \"Celtics\" wordmark inspired by the Slade's Bar &amp; Grill restaurant once owned by Russell. The black stripes contained 11 gold diamonds on each side, commemorating each of Russell's championships, and also featured a grayscale pattern of the parquet floor. The waistband contained Russell's jersey no. 6 surrounded by the 11 gold diamonds.\nThe \"City\" uniform in the 2023\u201324 season featured a nod to the origins of the game of basketball. The white-based design featured dark green letters and brown trim in reference to traditional maker's marks from Boston's history of furniture makers, along with wood grain accents to reference the peach baskets first used in the game. In another first, the Celtics unveiled an alternate court specific to the 2023 NBA in-season tournament. The design, which is based on the \"City\" uniform, featured a mostly green-painted maple court with a brown strip along the free throw lanes. The silhouette of the NBA Cup is situated along the free throw lanes, and the actual trophy is painted at center court along with the \"BOSTON\" wordmark.\nFor the 2024\u201325 \"City\" uniform, the Celtics built upon last season's \"City\" uniform and focused on continuous evolution of the game of basketball. The black-based uniform featured \"Action green\" (neon green) letters and striping, along with futuristic-style numbers.\nThe Celtics' \"City\" uniform for the 2025\u201326 season was based heavily on their 2018\u201319 \"City\" uniform, but lacked the green elements. Instead, it has a white base with the block \"BOSTON\" wordmark, uniform numbers and striping in metallic gold trimmed in black. The uniform paid homage to the franchise's winning tradition.\nMemorial patches.\nDuring the 2006\u201307 season, the Celtics wore a commemorative patch of a black shamrock with the nickname \"Red\" in green letters on the right top of the jersey in remembrance of Red Auerbach, who died shortly prior to the beginning of the season.\nThe team has honored deceased members of the Celtics family with a commemorative black band on the left shoulder strap of the jersey. It has been featured thirteen times to date: Walter Brown (1964\u201365), Bob Schmertz (1975\u201376), Joan Cohen (1989\u201390), Johnny Most (1992\u201393), Reggie Lewis (1993\u201394), Dorothy Auerbach (2000\u201301), Dennis Johnson (2006\u201307), Jim Loscutoff (2015\u201316), Jo Jo White (2017\u201318), John Havlicek (2018\u201319), Tom Heinsohn, and K. C. Jones (both 2020\u201321), Sam Jones (2021\u201322), and Bill Walton (2023\u201324). During the 2019\u201320 season, the Celtics wore a black band in honor of two people who had never been part of the Celtics organization; former NBA commissioner David Stern and former Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant. The Celtics have also worn a black band for reasons not directly related to the franchise, such as the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 (later replaced with a dedicated memorial patch), and the death of Isaiah Thomas' younger sister during the 2017 NBA playoffs.\nIn the 2022\u201323 season, the Celtics joined the rest of the NBA in wearing the black no. 6 patch in memory of Bill Russell.\nUniform traditions.\nThe team also had the tradition of wearing black sneakers through most of their history. According to legend, Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach had a problem with the white sneakers, claiming that the white sneakers can easily get dirty; hence starting a long tradition with the black sneakers. In the early 1970s, the Celtics changed their sneaker color to green, but by 1985, returned to the customary black due to the difficulty of producing the right shade of Celtic green.\nPrior to the 2003\u201304 season, then-Celtics general manager Danny Ainge and captain Paul Pierce suggested wearing white sneakers, in part due to a growing number of teams wearing black sneakers. Ainge gladly accepted and the white sneakers have remained since on home games. They still wore the black sneakers on away games, and brought them back for all home games during the 2004 NBA playoffs, and in one home game during the 2005 NBA playoffs. In the 2008\u201309 season, they wore white sneakers with green and gold accents while wearing their St. Patrick's Day jerseys on the road. Most recently, when the Celtics play on Christmas Day, they wore white or green sneakers with red and gold accents. Since the 2009\u201310 season, the NBA relaxed its rules on specified sneaker colors, and Celtics players are now seen wearing custom-made and personalized sneakers at home and on the road, although for the most part they wear either green, white or black sneakers.\nThe Celtics were the only team to wear warmup jackets with the player names on the back. During the 1980s, this style was dominant in most NBA warmup jackets, but by the late 1990s, this style gradually declined. The Celtics, however, kept the design in keeping with tradition, before discontinuing the practice after the 2011\u201312 season in favor of a templated jacket design common to all 30 teams.\nTelevision and radio.\nNBC Sports Boston is the Boston Celtics' main television outlet, having aired its games since 1981 when the station was known as PRISM New England. In 1983, it rebranded as SportsChannel New England. Like all the other SportsChannel networks, the New England channel was rebranded as Fox Sports New England when former owner Cablevision entered into a partnership with Liberty Media and News Corporation in 1998. Comcast purchased Cablevision's original network stake in 2001, then acquired the remaining stake in what was now FSN New England in 2007 and rebranded the network as Comcast SportsNet New England. In 2017, all CSN networks (including CSN New England) were renamed as NBC Sports Regional Networks in reference to Comcast's current ownership of NBCUniversal.\nAs of the 2024\u201325 season, Drew Carter serves as the television play-by-play announcer with Brian Scalabrine as an analyst.\nAll Celtics games are heard on radio through Beasley Broadcast Group's WBZ-FM (98.5, otherwise branded as \"The Sports Hub\"), with play-by-play from Sean Grande and color commentary from Cedric Maxwell, a deal in place since the 2013\u201314 season. It is carried on stations in 5 of the 6 New England States via the Boston Celtics Radio Network.\nLong-time announcers Johnny Most and Mike Gorman have won the Curt Gowdy Media Award for their outstanding work as broadcasters. Most was the team's radio announcer from 1953 to 1990, and Gorman served as the television announcer from 1981 to 2024.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "43377", "revid": "50723223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43377", "title": "Keratin", "text": "Structural fibrous protein\nKeratin () is one of a family of structural fibrous proteins also known as \"scleroproteins\". It is the key structural material making up scales, hair, nails, feathers, horns, claws, hooves, and the outer layer of skin in tetrapod vertebrates. Keratin also protects epithelial cells from damage or stress. Keratin is extremely insoluble in water and organic solvents. Keratin monomers assemble into bundles to form intermediate filaments, which are tough and form strong unmineralized epidermal appendages found in reptiles, birds, amphibians, and mammals. Excessive keratinization participate in fortification of certain tissues such as in horns of cattle and rhinos, and armadillos' osteoderm. The only other biological matter known to approximate the toughness of keratinized tissue is chitin.\nKeratin comes in two types: the primitive, softer forms found in all vertebrates and the harder, derived forms found only among sauropsids (reptiles and birds).\nExamples of occurrence.\nAlpha-keratins (\u03b1-keratins) are found in all vertebrates. They form the hair (including wool), the outer layer of skin, horns, nails, claws and hooves of mammals, and the slime threads of hagfish. The baleen plates of filter-feeding whales are also made of keratin. Keratin filaments are abundant in keratinocytes in the hornified layer of the epidermis; these are proteins which have undergone keratinization. They are also present in epithelial cells in general. For example, mouse thymic epithelial cells react with antibodies for keratin 5, keratin 8, and keratin 14. These antibodies are used as fluorescent markers to distinguish subsets of mouse thymic epithelial cells in genetic studies of the thymus.\nThe harder beta-keratins (\u03b2-keratins) are found only in the sauropsids, i.e., all living reptiles and birds. They are found in the nails, scales, and claws of reptiles, in some reptile shells (Testudines), and in the feathers, beaks, and claws of birds. These keratins are formed primarily in beta sheets. However, beta sheets are also found in \u03b1-keratins.\nRecent scholarship has shown that sauropsid \u03b2-keratins are fundamentally different from \u03b1-keratins at a genetic and structural level. The new term \"corneous beta protein\" (CBP) has been proposed to avoid confusion with \u03b1-keratins.\nKeratins (also described as cytokeratins) are polymers of type I and type II intermediate filaments that have been found only in chordates (vertebrates, amphioxi, urochordates). Nematodes and many other non-chordate animals seem to have only type V intermediate filaments, fibers that structure the nucleus.\nGenes.\nThe human genome encodes 54 functional keratin genes, located in two clusters on chromosomes 12 and 17. This suggests that they originated from a series of gene duplications on these chromosomes.\nThe keratins include the following proteins of which KRT23, KRT24, KRT25, KRT26, KRT27, KRT28, KRT31, KRT32, KRT33A, KRT33B, KRT34, KRT35, KRT36, KRT37, KRT38, KRT39, KRT40, KRT71, KRT72, KRT73, KRT74, KRT75, KRT76, KRT77, KRT78, KRT79, KRT8, KRT80, KRT81, KRT82, KRT83, KRT84, KRT85 and KRT86 have been used to describe keratins past 20.\nProtein structure.\nThe first sequences of keratins were determined by Israel Hanukoglu and Elaine Fuchs (1982, 1983). These sequences revealed that there are two distinct but homologous keratin families, which were named type I and type II keratins. By analysis of the primary structures of these keratins and other intermediate filament proteins, Hanukoglu and Fuchs suggested a model in which keratins and intermediate filament proteins contain a central ~310 residue domain with four segments in \u03b1-helical conformation that are separated by three short linker segments predicted to be in beta-turn conformation. This model has been confirmed by the determination of the crystal structure of a helical domain of keratins.\nType I and II keratins.\nThe human genome has 54 functional annotated keratin genes, of which 28 are type I keratins and 26 are type II keratins. \nFibrous keratin molecules supercoil to form a very stable, left-handed superhelical motif to multimerise, forming filaments consisting of multiple copies of the keratin monomer.\nThe major force that keeps the coiled-coil structure is hydrophobic interactions between apolar residues along the keratin's helical segments.\nLimited interior space is the reason why the triple helix of the (unrelated) structural protein collagen, found in skin, cartilage and bone, likewise has a high percentage of glycine. The connective tissue protein elastin also has a high percentage of both glycine and alanine. A preponderance of amino acids with small, nonreactive side groups is characteristic of structural proteins, for which H-bonded close packing is more important than chemical specificity.\nDisulfide bridges.\nIn addition to intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds, the distinguishing feature of keratins is the presence of large amounts of the sulfur-containing amino acid cysteine, required for the disulfide bridges that confer additional strength and rigidity by permanent, thermally stable crosslinking\u2014in much the same way that non-protein sulfur bridges stabilize vulcanized rubber. Human hair is approximately 14% cysteine. The pungent smells of burning hair and skin are due to the volatile sulfur compounds formed. Extensive disulfide bonding contributes to the insolubility of keratins, except in a small number of solvents such as dissociating or reducing agents.\nThe more flexible and elastic keratins of hair have fewer interchain disulfide bridges than the keratins in mammalian fingernails, hooves and claws (homologous structures), which are harder and more like their analogs in other vertebrate classes. Hair and other \u03b1-keratins consist of \u03b1-helically coiled single protein strands (with regular intra-chain H-bonding), which are then further twisted into superhelical ropes that may be further coiled. The \u03b2-keratins of reptiles and birds have \u03b2-pleated sheets twisted together, then stabilized and hardened by disulfide bridges.\nThiolated polymers (thiomers) can form disulfide bridges with cysteine substructures of keratins getting covalently attached to these proteins. Thiomers therefore exhibit high binding properties to keratins found in hair, on skin and on the surface of many cell types.\nFilament formation.\nIt has been proposed that keratins can be divided into 'hard' and 'soft' forms, or 'cytokeratins' and 'other keratins'. That model is now understood to be correct. A new nuclear addition in 2006 to describe keratins takes this into account.\nKeratin filaments are intermediate filaments. Like all intermediate filaments, keratin proteins form filamentous polymers in a series of assembly steps beginning with dimerization; dimers assemble into tetramers and octamers and eventually, if the current hypothesis holds, into unit-length-filaments (ULF) capable of annealing end-to-end into long filaments.\nCornification.\nCornification is the process of forming an epidermal barrier in\nstratified squamous epithelial tissue. At the cellular level,\ncornification is characterised by:\nMetabolism ceases, and the cells are almost completely filled by keratin. During the process of epithelial differentiation, cells become cornified as keratin protein is incorporated into longer keratin intermediate filaments. Eventually the nucleus and cytoplasmic organelles disappear, metabolism ceases and cells undergo a programmed death as they become fully keratinized. In many other cell types, such as cells of the dermis, keratin filaments and other intermediate filaments function as part of the cytoskeleton to mechanically stabilize the cell against physical stress. It does this through connections to desmosomes, cell\u2013cell junctional plaques, and hemidesmosomes, cell-basement membrane adhesive structures.\nCells in the epidermis contain a structural matrix of keratin, which makes this outermost layer of the skin almost waterproof, and along with collagen and elastin gives skin its strength. Rubbing and pressure cause thickening of the outer, cornified layer of the epidermis and form protective calluses, which are useful for athletes and on the fingertips of musicians who play stringed instruments. Keratinized epidermal cells are constantly shed and replaced.\nThese hard, integumentary structures are formed by intercellular cementing of fibers formed from the dead, cornified cells generated by specialized beds deep within the skin. Hair grows continuously and feathers molt and regenerate. The constituent proteins may be phylogenetically homologous but differ somewhat in chemical structure and supermolecular organization. The evolutionary relationships are complex and only partially known. Multiple genes have been identified for the \u03b2-keratins in feathers, and this is probably characteristic of all keratins.\nClinical significance.\nAbnormal growth of keratin can occur in a variety of conditions including keratosis, hyperkeratosis and keratoderma.\nMutations in keratin gene expression can lead to, among others:\nSeveral diseases, such as athlete's foot and ringworm, are caused by infectious fungi that feed on keratin.\nKeratin is highly resistant to digestive acids if ingested. Cats regularly ingest hair as part of their grooming behavior, leading to the gradual formation of hairballs that may be expelled orally or excreted. In humans, trichophagia may lead to Rapunzel syndrome, an extremely rare but potentially fatal intestinal condition.\nDiagnostic use.\nKeratin expression is helpful in determining epithelial origin in anaplastic cancers. Tumors that express keratin include carcinomas, thymomas, sarcomas and trophoblastic neoplasms. Furthermore, the precise expression-pattern of keratin subtypes allows prediction of the origin of the primary tumor when assessing metastases. For example, hepatocellular carcinomas typically express CK8 and CK18, and cholangiocarcinomas express CK7, CK8 and CK18, while metastases of colorectal carcinomas express CK20, but not CK7.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The springs consisted of several loops of twisted skeins. Early versions projected heavy darts or spherical stone projectiles of various sizes for siege warfare. It developed into a smaller precision weapon, the \"scorpio\", and possibly the \"polybolos\".\nGreek weapon.\nThe early ballistae in Ancient Greece were developed from two weapons called oxybeles and gastraphetes. The gastraphetes ('belly-bow') was a handheld crossbow. It had a composite prod and was spanned by bracing the front end of the weapon against the ground while placing the end of a slider mechanism against the stomach. The operator would then walk forward to arm the weapon while a ratchet prevented it from shooting during loading. This produced a weapon that, it was claimed, could be operated by a person of average strength but which had a power that allowed it to be successfully used against armored troops. The oxybeles were a bigger and heavier construction employing a winch and were mounted on a tripod. It had a lower rate of fire and was used as a siege engine.\nWith the invention of the torsion spring bundle, the first ballistae could now be built. The advantage of this new technology was the fast relaxation time of this system. Thus it was possible to shoot lighter projectiles with higher velocities over a longer distance. By contrast, the comparatively slow relaxation time of the bow or prod of a conventional crossbow such as the oxybeles meant that much less energy could be transferred to light projectiles, limiting the effective range of the weapon.\nThe earliest form of the ballista is thought to have been developed for Dionysius of Syracuse, c. 400 BC.\nThe Greek ballista was a siege weapon. All components that were not made of wood were transported in the baggage train. It would be assembled with local wood, if necessary. Some were positioned inside large, armored, mobile siege towers or even on the edge of a battlefield. For all of the tactical advantages offered, it was only under Philip II of Macedon, and even more so under his son Alexander, that the ballista began to develop and gain recognition as both a siege engine and field artillery. Historical accounts, for instance, cited that Philip II employed a group of engineers within his army to design and build catapults for his military campaigns. There is even a claim that it was Philip II with his team of engineers who invented the ballista after improving Dionysius's device, which was merely an oversized slingshot. It was further perfected by Alexander, whose own team of engineers introduced innovations such as the idea of using springs made from tightly strung coils of rope instead of a bow to achieve more energy and power when throwing projectiles. Polybius reported about the usage of smaller, more portable ballistae, called scorpions, during the Second Punic War.\nBallistae could be easily modified to shoot both spherical and shaft projectiles, allowing their crews to adapt quickly to prevailing battlefield situations in real time.\nAs the role of battlefield artillery became more sophisticated, a universal joint (which was invented just for this function) was integrated into the ballista's stand, allowing the operators to alter the trajectory and firing direction of the ballista as required without a lengthy disassembly of the machine.\nRoman weaponry.\nAfter the absorption of the Ancient Greek city-states into the Roman Republic in 146 BC, the highly advanced Greek technology began to spread across many areas of Roman influence. This included the great military machine advances the Greeks had made (most notably by Dionysus of Syracuse), as well as all the scientific, mathematical, political and artistic developments.\nThe Romans adopted the torsion-powered ballista, which had by now spread to several cities around the Mediterranean, all of which became Roman spoils of war, including one from Pergamon, which was depicted among a pile of trophy weapons in relief on a balustrade.\nThe torsion ballista, developed by Alexander, was a far more complicated weapon than its predecessor and the Romans developed it even further, especially into much smaller versions, that could be easily carried.\nEarly Roman ballistae.\nThe early Roman \"ballistae\" were made of wood, and held together with iron plates around the frames and iron nails in the stand. The main stand had a slider on the top, into which were loaded the bolts or stone \"shot\". Attached to this, at the back, was a pair of 'winches' and a 'claw', used to ratchet the bowstring back to the armed firing position.\nThe slider passed through the \"field frames\" of the weapon, in which were located the \"torsion springs\" (rope made of animal sinew), which were twisted around the bow arms, which in turn, were attached to the bowstring.\nDrawing the bowstring back with the winches twisted the already taut springs, storing the energy to fire the projectiles. The bronze or iron caps, which secured the torsion bundles were adjustable by means of pins and peripheral holes, which allowed the weapon to be tuned for symmetrical power and for changing weather conditions.\nThe \"ballista\" was a highly accurate weapon (there are many accounts of single soldiers being picked off by ballistarii), but some design aspects meant it could compromise its accuracy for range. The maximum range was over , but the effective combat range for many targets was far shorter.\nThe Romans continued the development of the \"ballista\", and it became a highly prized and valued weapon in the army of the Roman Empire.\nIt was used, just before the start of the Empire, by Julius Caesar during his conquest of Gaul and on both of his campaigns in subduing Britain.\nFirst invasion of Britain.\nThe first of Caesar's invasions of Britain took place in 55 BC, after a rapid and successful initial conquest of Gaul, in part as an expedition, and more practical to try to put an end to the reinforcements sent by the native Britons to fight the Romans in Gaul.\nA total of eighty means of transport, carrying two legions, attempted to land on the British shore, only to be driven back by the many British warriors assembled along the shoreline. The ships had to unload their troops on the beach, as it was the only one suitable for many miles, yet the massed ranks of British charioteers and javeliners were making it difficult.\nSeeing this, Caesar ordered the warships \u2013 which were swifter and easier to handle than the transports, and likely to impress the natives more by their unfamiliar appearance \u2013 to be removed a short distance from the others, and then be rowed hard and run ashore on the enemy's right flank, from which position men on deck could use the slings, bows, and artillery to drive them back. This maneuver was highly successful.&lt;br&gt; Scared by the strange shape of the warships, the motion of the oars, and the unfamiliar machines, the natives halted and retreated. (Caesar, \"The Conquest of Gaul\", p.99)\nSiege of Alesia.\nIn Gaul, the stronghold of Alesia was under a Roman siege in 52 BC, and was completely surrounded by a Roman fortification including a wooden palisade and towers. As was standard siege technique at the time, small \"ballistae\" were placed in the towers with other troops armed with bows or slings. The use of the \"ballista\" in the Roman siege strategy was also demonstrated in the case of the Siege of Masada.\nBallistae in the Roman Empire.\nDuring the conquest of the Empire, the ballista proved its worth many times in sieges and battles, both at sea and on land. It is from the time of the Roman Empire that many of the archaeological finds of ballistae date. Accounts by the finders, including technical manuals and journals, are used today by archaeologists to reconstruct these weapons.\nAfter Julius Caesar, the ballista was a permanent fixture in the Roman army and, over time, modifications and improvements were made by successive engineers. This included replacing the remaining wooden parts of the machine with metal, creating a much smaller, lighter and more powerful machine than the wooden version, which required less maintenance (though the vital torsion springs were still vulnerable to the strain). The largest ballistae of the 4th century could throw a dart further than 1200 yards (1,100 m). The weapon was named \"ballista fulminalis\" in \"De rebus bellicis\": \"From this ballista, darts were projected not only in great number but also at a large size over a considerable distance, such as across the width of the Danube River.\" Ballistae were not only used in laying siege: after AD\u00a0350, at least 22 semi-circular towers were erected around the walls of Londinium (London) to provide platforms for permanently mounted defensive devices.\nEastern Roman Empire.\nDuring the 6th century, Procopius described the effects of this weapon:\nBut Belisarius placed upon the towers engines which they call \"ballistae\". Now these engines have the form of a bow, but on the under side of them a grooved wooden shaft projects; this shaft is so fitted to the bow that it is free to move, and rests upon a straight iron bed. So when men wish to shoot at the enemy with this, they make the parts of the bow which form the ends bend toward one another by means of a short rope fastened to them, and they place in the grooved shaft the arrow, which is about one half the length of the ordinary missiles which they shoot from bows, but about four times as wide...but the missile is discharged from the shaft, and with such force that it attains the distance of not less than two bow-shots, and that, when it hits a tree or a rock, it pierces it easily. Such is the engine which bears this name, being so called because it shoots with very great force...\nThe missiles were able to penetrate body-armour:\nAnd at the Salarian Gate a Goth of goodly stature and a capable warrior, wearing a corselet and having a helmet on his head, a man who was of no mean station in the Gothic nation, refused to remain in the ranks with his comrades, but stood by a tree and kept shooting many missiles at the parapet. But this man by some chance was hit by a missile from an engine which was on a tower at his left. And passing through the corselet and the body of the man, the missile sank more than half its length into the tree, and pinning him to the spot where it entered the tree, it suspended him there a corpse.\nCarroballista.\nThe carroballista was a cart-mounted version of the weapon. There were probably different models of ballista under the \"cheiroballistra\" class, at least two different two-wheeled models and one model with four wheels. Their probable size was roughly width, i.e., 5 Roman feet. The cart system and structure gave it a great deal of flexibility and capability as a battlefield weapon, since the increased maneuverability allowed it to be moved with the flow of the battle. This weapon features several times on Trajan's Column.\nPolybolos.\nIt has been speculated that the Roman military may have also fielded a 'repeating' ballista, also known as a \"polybolos\". Reconstruction and trials of such a weapon carried out in a BBC documentary, \"What the Romans Did For Us\", showed that they \"were able to shoot eleven bolts a minute, which is almost four times the rate at which an ordinary ballista can be operated\". However, no example of such a weapon has been found by archaeologists.\nCheiroballistra and manuballista.\nThe cheiroballistra and the manuballista are held by many archaeologists to be the same weapon. The difference in name may be attributable to the different languages spoken in the Empire. Latin remained the official language in the Western Empire, but the Eastern Empire predominantly used Greek, which added an extra 'r' to the word ballista.\nThe manuballista was a handheld version of the traditional ballista. This new version was made entirely of iron, which conferred greater power to the weapon, since it was smaller, and less iron (an expensive material before the 19th century), was used in its production. It was not the ancient gastraphetes, but the Roman weapon. However, the same physical limitations applied as with the gastraphetes.\nArchaeology and the Roman ballista.\nArchaeology, and in particular experimental archaeology has been influential on this subject. Although several ancient authors (such as Vegetius) wrote very detailed technical treatises, providing us with all the information necessary to reconstruct the weapons, all their measurements were in their native language and therefore highly difficult to translate.\nAttempts to reconstruct these ancient weapons began at the end of the 19th century, based on rough translations of ancient authors. It was only during the 20th century, however, that many of the reconstructions began to make any sense as a weapon. By bringing in modern engineers, progress was made with the ancient systems of measurement. By redesigning the reconstructions using the new information, archaeologists in that specialty were able to recognise certain finds from Roman military sites, and identify them as ballistae. The information gained from the excavations was fed into the next generation of reconstructions and so on.\nSites across the empire have yielded information on ballistae, from Spain (the Ampurias Catapult), to Italy (the Cremona Battleshield, which proved that the weapons had decorative metal plates to shield the operators), to Iraq (the Hatra Machine) and even Scotland (Burnswark siege tactics training camp), and many other sites between.\nThe most influential archaeologists in this area have been Peter Connolly and Eric Marsden, who have not only written extensively on the subject but have also made many reconstructions themselves and have refined the designs over many years of work.\nMiddle Ages.\nWith the decline of the Roman Empire, resources to build and maintain these complex machines became very scarce, so the ballista was likely supplanted initially by the simpler and cheaper onager and the more efficient springald.\nHowever, while it remained less and less popular as more efficient siege engines such as the trebuchet and the mangonel became widespread, the Ballista still retained some use in Medieval Siege Warfare, especially by city and castle garrisons, until it became finally extinguished by the more convenient medieval cannons, already omnipresent in all major European Catholic cities by the first half of the 14th century.\nThe Littere Wallie records the existence of 4 \"balistas ad turrimi\" at \"Duluithelan\" [Dolwyddelan] Castle in 1280, one \"balistam de tur\" at \"Rothelano\"[Rhuddlan] castle and one \"magnam ballistam\" at \"Bere Blada\" Castle [Castell y Bere?] in 1286. These all being held under the authority of the English Crown.\nIn more remote regions such as Ireland, where cannons were rare and personal firearms were almost non-existent, ballistae had recorded use well into late 15th century. \nWhile not a direct descendant mechanically, the concept and naming continues on as arbalest crossbows (\"arcus\" 'bow' + ballista).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was a common powerful siege engine until the advent of gunpowder. The design of a trebuchet allows it to launch projectiles of greater weights and further distances than a traditional catapult.\nThere are two main types of trebuchet. The first is the \"traction trebuchet\", or mangonel, which uses manpower to swing the arm. It first appeared in China by the 4th century BC. It spread westward, possibly via the Avars, and was adopted by the Byzantines, Persians, Arabs, and other neighboring peoples by the sixth to seventh centuries AD.\nThe later, and often larger and more powerful, counterweight trebuchet, also known as the counterpoise trebuchet, uses a counterweight to swing the arm. It appeared in both Christian and Muslim lands around the Mediterranean in the 12th century, and was carried back to China by the Mongols in the 13th century.\nEtymology and terminology.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe numerous forms of the word that appeared during the 13th century, including \"trabocco\", \"tribok\", \"tribuclietta\", and \"trubechetum\", have obscured the origin of the term. In Arabic the counterweight trebuchet was called \"manjaniq maghribi\" or \"majaniq ifranji\". In China, the traction trebuchet was called the \"pao\" while the counterweight trebuchet was called the \"h\u00faih\u00fai p\u00e0o\" (Muslim trebuchet).\nThe English word \"trebuchet\" is first mentioned in the 14th century (13th century in Anglo-Latin) as \"medieval stone-throwing engine of war\". It is borrowed from (Old) French \"trebuchet\" (now \"tr\u00e9buchet\").\nThe French word is from the verbal root of \"trebucher\" (now \"tr\u00e9bucher\") : \"trebuch-\" + diminutive noun suffix \"-et\", \"trebucher\" (10th century) meant \"to overthrow, to bring down\", then and now \"to stumble\", maybe earlier \"to rock\" or \"to tilt\". It is a compound of (Old) French \"tre(s)-\", variant form \"tra-\" (now \"tr\u00e9-\" / \"tra-\") from Latin \"trans\" expressing \"displacement\" in that case + Old French \"buc\" \"trunk of the body, bulk\", itself from Old Low Franconian \"*b\u016bk-\" \"belly\" similar to Old High German \"buh\", German \"Bauch\" \"belly\".\nThe earliest appearance of the term \"trebuchet\" in French dates to the late 12th century and the first attestations of \"trebuchet\" as a siege weapon are from around the year 1200. The 1174\u20131177 edition of \"Roman de Renart\", an epic about \"Renard the Fox\", describes it as a \"trap whose trigger mechanism consists of an assembly of balanced logs\" (understood as animal trap by 1375) while the c.\u20091200 edition describes it as a \"war engine that throws stones to break down walls\". The word \"trabuchellus\" appeared alongside \"manganum\" and \"prederia\" in a document in Vicenza on 6\u00a0 1189 ()\u00a0(1189--). \"Trabucha\" is found a decade later with \"predariae\" at the siege of Castelnuovo Bocca d'Adda in an account by Iohannes Codagnellus. It is unclear, however, whether these referred to counterweight trebuchets. Codagnellus did not specify a specific type of engine with the term and even implied that they were \"fairly light in subsequent references\". Only in the late 1210s do variations of \"trebuchet\" in sources, described as increasingly powerful machines or utilizing different components, identify more closely with the counterweight trebuchet. Other terms, such as \"machina maior/magna\", might have also referred to counterweight trebuchets.\n\"Traction trebuchet\" and \"counterweight trebuchet\" are modern terms (retronyms), not used by contemporary users of the weapons. The term \"traction trebuchet\" was created mainly to distinguish this type of weapon from the \"onager\", a torsion powered catapult that is often conflated in contemporary sources with the \"mangonel\", which was used as a generic term for any medieval stone throwing artillery. Both the traction and counterweight trebuchets have been called \"mangonel\" at one point or another. Confusion between the onager, mangonel, trebuchet, and other catapult types in contemporary terminology has led some historians today to use the more precise \"traction trebuchet\" instead, with \"counterweight trebuchet\" used to distinguish what was before called simply a \"trebuchet\". Some modern historians use \"mangonel\" to mean exclusively traction trebuchets, while others call traction trebuchets \"traction mangonels\" and counterweight trebuchets \"counterweight mangonels\".\nBasic design.\nThe trebuchet is a compound machine that makes use of the mechanical advantage of a lever to throw a projectile. They are typically large constructions, with the length of the beam as much as , with some purported to be even larger.\nA trebuchet consists primarily of a long beam attached by an axle suspended high above the ground by a stout frame and base, such that the beam can rotate vertically through a wide arc (typically over 180\u00b0). A sling is attached to one end of the beam to hold the projectile. The projectile is thrown when the beam is quickly rotated by applying force to the opposite end of the beam. The mechanical advantage is primarily obtained by having the projectile section of the beam much longer than the opposite section where the force is applied \u2013 usually four to six times longer.\nThe difference between counterweight and traction trebuchets is what force they use. Counterweight trebuchets use gravity; potential energy is stored by slowly raising an extremely heavy box (typically filled with stones, sand, or lead) attached to the shorter end of the beam (typically on a hinged connection), and releasing it on command.\nTraction trebuchets use human power; on command, men pull ropes attached to the shorter end of the trebuchet beam. The difficulties of coordinating the pull of many men together repeatedly and predictably makes counterweight trebuchets preferable for the larger machines, though they are more complicated to engineer. The trebuchet had further modifications to allow an increase to its range, by creating a slot for the sling and projectile to sit underneath the trebuchet, enabling the sling to be lengthened and thus extending the range, an alteration in the trajectory, or the release point to be changed. Further increasing their complexity is that either winches or treadwheels, aided by block and tackle, are typically required to raise the more massive counterweights. So while counterweight trebuchets require significantly fewer men to operate than traction trebuchets, they require significantly more time to reload. In a long siege, reload time may not be a critical concern.\nWhen the trebuchet is operated, the force causes rotational acceleration of the beam around the axle (the fulcrum of the lever). These factors multiply the acceleration transmitted to the throwing portion of the beam and its attached sling. The sling starts rotating with the beam, but rotates farther (typically about 360\u00b0) and therefore faster, transmitting this increased speed to the projectile. The length of the sling increases the mechanical advantage, and also changes the trajectory so that, at the time of release from the sling, the projectile is traveling in the desired speed and angle to give it the range to hit the target. Adjusting the sling's release point is the primary means of fine-tuning the range, as the rest of the trebuchet's actions are difficult to adjust after construction.\nThe rotation speed of the throwing beam increases smoothly, starting slow but building up quickly. After the projectile is released, the arm continues to rotate, allowed to smoothly slow down on its own accord and come to rest at the end of the rotation. This is unlike the violent sudden stop inherent in the action of other catapult designs such as the onager, which must absorb most of the launching energy into their own frame, and must be heavily built and reinforced as a result. This key difference makes the trebuchet much more durable, allowing for larger and more powerful machines.\nA trebuchet projectile can be almost anything, even debris, rotting carcasses, or incendiaries, but is typically a large stone. Dense stone, or even metal, specially worked to be round and smooth, gives the best range and predictability. When attempting to breach enemy walls, it is important to use materials that will not shatter on impact; projectiles were sometimes brought from distant quarries to get the desired properties.\nHistory.\nTraction trebuchet.\nThe traction trebuchet, also referred to as a mangonel in some sources, originated in ancient China.\nThe first recorded use of traction trebuchets was in ancient China. They were probably used by the Mohists as early as 4th century BC; descriptions can be found in the \"Mozi\" (compiled in the 4th century BC). According to the \"Mozi\", the traction trebuchet was high with buried below ground, the fulcrum attached was constructed from the wheels of a cart, the throwing arm was long with three quarters above the pivot and a quarter below to which the ropes are attached, and the sling long. The range given for projectiles are , , and . They were used as defensive weapons stationed on walls and sometimes hurled hollowed-out logs filled with burning charcoal to destroy enemy siege works. By the 1st century AD, commentators were interpreting other passages in texts such as the \"Zuo zhuan\" and \"Classic of Poetry\" as references to the traction trebuchet: \"the guai is 'a great arm of wood on which a stone is laid, and this by means of a device [ji] is shot off and so strikes down the enemy.'\" The \"Records of the Grand Historian\" say that \"The flying stones weigh 12 catties and by devices [ji] are shot off 300 paces.\" Traction trebuchets went into decline during the Han dynasty due to long periods of peace but became a common siege weapon again during the Three Kingdoms period. They were commonly called stone-throwing machines, thunder carriages, and stone carriages in the following centuries. They were used as ship mounted weapons by 573 for attacking enemy fortifications. It seems that during the early 7th century, improvements were made on traction trebuchets, although it is not explicitly stated what. According to a stele in Barkul celebrating Tang Taizong's conquest of what is now Ejin Banner, the engineer Jiang Xingben made great advancements on trebuchets that were unknown in ancient times. Jiang Xingben participated in the construction of siege engines for Taizong's campaigns against the Western Regions. In 617 Li Mi (Sui dynasty) constructed 300 trebuchets for his assault on Luoyang, in 621 Li Shimin did the same at Luoyang, and onward into the Song dynasty when in 1161, trebuchets operated by Song dynasty soldiers fired bombs of lime and sulphur against the ships of the Jin dynasty navy during the Battle of Caishi.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For the trebuchet they use large baulks of wood to make the framework, fixing it on four wheels below. From this there rise up two posts having between them a horizontal bar which carries a single arm so that the top of the machine is like a swape. The arm is arranged as to height, length and size, according to the city [which it is proposed to attack or defend]. At the end of the arm there is a sling which holds the stone or stones, of weight and number depending on the stoutness of the arm. Men [suddenly] pull [ropes attached to the other] end, and so shoot it forth. The carriage framework can be pushed and turned around at will. Alternatively the ends [of the beams of the framework] can be buried in the ground and so used. [But whether you use] the 'Whirlwind' type or the 'Four-footed' type depends upon the circumstances.\u2014\u200a\nThe traction trebuchet was adopted by various peoples west of China such as the Byzantines, Persians, Arabs, and Avars by the sixth to seventh centuries AD. Some scholars suggest that the Avars carried the traction trebuchet westward while others claim that the Byzantines already possessed knowledge of the traction trebuchet beforehand. Regardless of the vector of transmission, it appeared in the eastern Mediterranean by the late 6th century AD, where it replaced torsion powered siege engines such as the ballista and onager. The rapid displacement of torsion siege engines was probably due to a combination of reasons. The traction trebuchet is simpler in design, has a faster rate of fire, increased accuracy, and comparable range and power. It was probably also safer than the twisted cords of torsion weapons, \"whose bundles of taut sinews stored up huge amounts of energy even in resting state and were prone to catastrophic failure when in use.\" At the same time, the late Roman Empire seems to have fielded \"considerably less artillery than its forebears, organised now in separate units, so the weaponry that came into the hands of successor states might have been limited in quantity.\" Evidence from Gaul and Germania suggests there was substantial loss of skills and techniques in artillery further west.\nAccording to the \"Miracles of Saint Demetrius\", probably written around 620 by John, Archbishop of Thessaloniki, the Avaro-Slavs attacked Thessaloniki in 586 with traction trebuchets. The bombardment lasted for hours, but the operators were inaccurate and most of the shots missed their target. When one stone did reach their target, it \"demolished the top of the rampart down to the walkway.\" The Byzantines adopted the traction trebuchet possibly as early as 587, the Persians in the early 7th century, and the Arabs in the second half of the 7th century. In 652, the Arabs used trebuchets at the siege of Dongola in the Sudan. Like the Chinese, by 653, the Arabs also had ship mounted traction trebuchets. The Franks and Saxons adopted the weapon in the 8th century. The \"Life of Louis the Pious\" contains the earliest western European reference to mangonels (traction trebuchets) in its account of the siege of Tortosa (808\u2013809). In 1173, the Republic of Pisa tried to capture an island castle with traction trebuchet on galleys. Traction trebuchets were also used in India.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The catapult, the account of which has been translated from the Greek several times, was quadrangular, with a wide base but narrowing towards the top, using large iron rollers to which were fixed timber beams \"similar to the beams of big houses\", having at the back a sling, and at the front thick cables, enabling the arm to be raised and lowered, and which threw \"enormous blocks into the air with a terrifying noise\".\u2014\u200a\nThe traction trebuchet was most efficient as an anti-personnel weapon, used in a supportive position alongside archers and slingers. Most accounts of traction trebuchets describe them as light artillery weapons while actual penetration of defenses was the result of mining or siege towers. At the siege of Kamacha in 766, Byzantine defenders used wooden cover to protect themselves from the enemy artillery while inflicting casualties with their own stone throwers. Michael the Syrian noted that at the siege of Balis in 823 it was the defenders that suffered from bombardment rather than the fortifications. At the siege of Kaysum, Abdallah ibn Tahir al-Khurasani used artillery to damage houses in the town. The Sack of Amorium in 838 saw the use of traction trebuchets to drive away defenders and destroy wooden defenses. At the siege of Marand in 848, traction trebuchets were used, \"reportedly killing 100 and wounding 400 on each side during the eight-month siege.\" During the siege of Baghdad in 865, defensive artillery were responsible for repelling an attack on the city gate while traction trebuchets on boats claimed a hundred of the defenders' lives.\nSome exceptionally large and powerful traction trebuchets have been described during the 11th century or later. At the siege of Manzikert (1054), the Seljuks' initial siege artillery was countered by the defenders' own, which shot stones at the besieging machine. In response, the Seljuks constructed another one requiring 400 men to pull and threw stones weighing . A breach was created on the first shot but the machine was burnt down by the defenders. According to Matthew of Edessa, this machine weighed and caused a number of casualties to the city's defenders. Ibn al-Adim describes a traction trebuchet capable of throwing a man in 1089. At the siege of Haizhou in 1161, a traction trebuchet was reported to have had a range of 200 paces (over ).\nWest of China, the traction trebuchet remained the primary siege engine until the 12th century when it was replaced by the counterweight trebuchet. In China the traction trebuchet was the primary siege engine until the counterweight trebuchet was introduced during the Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty in the 13th century.\nCounterweight trebuchet.\nOrigins.\nThere is little to no consensus as to where and when the counterweight trebuchet, which has been described as the \"most powerful weapon of the Middle Ages\", was first developed. The earliest known description and illustration of a counterweight trebuchet comes from a commentary on the conquests of Saladin by Mardi ibn Ali al-Tarsusi in 1187. However cases for the existence of both European and Muslim counterweight trebuchets prior to 1187 have been made. In 1090, Khalaf ibn Mula'ib threw out a man from the citadel in Salamiya with a machine and in the early 12th century, Muslim siege engines were able to breach crusader fortifications. David Nicolle argues that these events could have only been possible with the use of counterweight trebuchets.\nAlthough al-Tarsusi provided the first description and illustration of a counterweight trebuchet, the text implies that the engine was not new and had previously been built. Al-Tarsusi referred to the counterweight trebuchet as the \"Persian\" trebuchet whereas the \"Frankish\" trebuchet was a light traction engine. Later during the 13th century, Muslims used \"manjaniq maghribi\" (Western trebuchet) and \"manjaniq ifranji\" (Frankish trebuchet) to refer to counterweight trebuchets. Paul E. Chevedden suggests that \"manjaniq maghribi\" was used to describe hinged counterweight engines in contrast to previous fixed or hanging counterweight trebuchets. Sometimes counterweight trebuchets are separated into two or three different categories based on how their counterweights are attached. These being fixed, hanging, and hinged counterweights. A fixed counterweight is an intrinsic part of the swinging arm and its trajectory is circular. Hanging counterweights hang below the arm and drop vertically. Hinged counterweights are attached to the arm by a swinging joint. Some fixed counterweights also had a hinged component. The type described by al-Tarsusi was a hanging counterweight. Writing in 1280, Giles of Rome claimed that hinged counterweight trebuchets had a greater range than fixed counterweight types.\nChevedden argues that counterweight trebuchets appeared prior to 1187 in Europe based on what might have been counterweight trebuchets in earlier sources. The 12th-century Byzantine historian Niketas Choniates may have been referring to a counterweight trebuchet when he described one equipped with a windlass, which is only useful to counterweight machines, at the siege of Zevgminon in 1165. However the source for this was written in the 1180s to 1190s and Niketas may have been placing the engine of his own time anachronistically into the past. At the siege of Nicaea in 1097 the Byzantine emperor Alexios I Komnenos reportedly invented new pieces of heavy artillery which deviated from the conventional design and made a deep impression on everyone. Illustrations produced later in 1270 depicted fixed counterweight trebuchets used at the siege. Possible references to counterweight trebuchets also appear for the second siege of Tyre in 1124, where the crusaders reportedly made use of \"great trebuchets\". However the sources for this siege, Fulcher of Chartres and William of Tyre, only mention \"machinae\" and \"machinae iaculatoriae\" that were later translated as \"perrieres\" and \"mangoniaux\" in the \"Estoire d'Eracles\". Chevedden argues that given the references to new and better trebuchets that by the 1120\u201330s, the counterweight trebuchet was being used in a variety of places by different peoples such as the crusader states, the Normans of Sicily and the Seljuks.\nThe earliest solid reference to a \"trebuchet\" in European sources dates to the siege of Castelnuovo Bocca d'Adda in 1199. However it is unclear if this referred to counterweight trebuchets since the author did not specify what engine was used and described the machine as fairly light. They may have been used in Germany from around 1205. Only in the late 1210s do references to \"trebuchet\", describing more powerful engines and different components, more closely align with the features of a counterweight trebuchet. Some of these more powerful engines may have just been traction trebuchets, as one was described being pulled by ten thousand. At the siege of Toulouse (1217\u20131218), \"trabuquets\" were mentioned to have been deployed, but the siege engine depicted at the tomb of Simon de Montfort, who was killed by artillery at the siege, is a traction trebuchet. Though soon after, clear evidence of counterweight machines appeared. According to the \"Song of the Albigensian Crusade\", the defenders \"ran to the ropes and wound the trebuchets\", and to shoot the machine, they \"then released their ropes.\" They were used in England at least by 1217 and in Iberia shortly after 1218. By the 1230s the counterweight trebuchet was a common item in siege warfare. Despite the lack of clearly definable terms in the late 12th and early 13th centuries, it is likely that both Muslims and Europeans already had working knowledge of the counterweight trebuchet beforehand. From the First Crusade (1096\u20131099) onward, there does not appear to be any discernible difference in the technology of siege engines employed by Muslim and Frankish forces, and by the Third Crusade (1189\u20131192), both sides seemed well acquainted with the enemy's siege weapons, which \"appear to have been remarkably similar.\"\nChina.\nCounterweight trebuchets do not appear with certainty in Chinese historical records until about 1268. Prior to 1268, the counterweight trebuchet may have been used in 1232 by the Jurchen Jin commander Qiang Shen. Qiang invented a device called the \"Arresting Trebuchet\" which only needed a few men to work it, and could hurl great stones more than a hundred paces, further than even the strongest traction trebuchet. However no other details on the machine are given. Qiang died the following year and no further references to the Arresting Trebuchet appear. The earliest definite mention of the counterweight trebuchet in China was in 1268, when the Mongols laid siege to Fancheng and Xiangyang. After failing to take the twin cities of Fancheng and Xiangyang for several years, collectively known as the siege of Fancheng and Xiangyang, the Mongol army brought in two Persian engineers to build hinged counterweight trebuchets. Known as the Huihui trebuchet (\u56de\u56de\u7832, where \"huihui\" is a loose slang referring to any Muslims), or Xiangyang trebuchet (\u8944\u967d\u7832) because they were first encountered in that battle. Ismail and Al-aud-Din travelled to South China from Iraq and built trebuchets for the siege. Chinese and Muslim engineers operated artillery and siege engines for the Mongol armies. By 1283, counterweight trebuchets were also used in Southeast Asia by the Chams against the Yuan dynasty.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The design of the Muslim trebuchets came originally from the Muslim countries, and they were more powerful than ordinary trebuchets. In the case of the largest ones, the wooden framework stood above a hole in the ground. The projectiles were several feet in diameter, and when they fell to the earth they made a hole three or four feet deep. [W]hen [the artillerists] wanted to hurl them to a great range, they added weight [to the counterpoise] and set it further back [on the arm;] when they needed only a shorter distance, they set it forward, nearer [the fulcrum].\u2014\u200a\nFunction.\nWhile some historians have described the counterweight trebuchet as a type of medieval super weapon, other historians have urged caution in overemphasizing its destructive capability. On the side of the counterweight engine as a medieval military revolution, historians such as Sydney Toy, Paul Chevedden, and Hugh Kennedy consider its power to have caused significant changes in medieval warfare. This line of thought suggests that rams were abandoned due to the effectiveness of the counterweight trebuchet, which was capable of reducing \"any fortress to rubble\". Accordingly, traditional fortifications became obsolete and had to be improved with new architectural structures to support defensive counterweight trebuchets. In southern France during the Albigensian Crusade, sieges were a last resort and negotiations for surrender were common. In these instances, trebuchets were used to threaten or bombard enemy fortifications and ensure victory. On the side of caution, historians such as John France, Christopher Marshall, and Michael Fulton emphasize the still considerable difficulty of reducing fortifications with siege artillery. Examples of the failure of siege artillery include the lack of evidence that artillery ever threatened the defenses of Kerak Castle between 1170 and 1188. Marshall maintains that \"the methods of attack and defence remained largely the same through the thirteenth century as they had been during the twelfth.\" Reservations on the counterweight trebuchet's destructive capability were expressed by Viollet-le-Duc, who \"asserted that even counterweight-powered artillery could do little more than destroy crenellations, clear defenders from parapets and target the machines of the besieged.\"\nIn spite of the evidence regarding increasingly powerful counterweight trebuchets during the 13th century, \"it remains an important consideration that not one of these appears to have effected a breach that directly led to the fall of a stronghold.\" In 1220, Al-Mu'azzam Isa laid siege to Atlit with a \"trabuculus\", three \"petrariae\", and four \"mangonelli\" but could not penetrate past the outer wall, which was soft but thick. As late as the siege of Acre (1291), where the Mamluk Sultanate fielded 72 or 92 trebuchets, including 14 or 15 counterweight trebuchets and the remaining traction types, they were never able to fulfill a breaching role. The Mamluks entered the city by sapping the northeast corner of the outer wall. Though stone projectiles of substantial size (~) have been found at Acre, located near the site of the siege and likely used by the Mamluks, surviving walls of a 13th-century Montmusard tower are no more than one meter thick. There is no indication that the thickness of fortress walls increased exponentially rather than a modest increase of between the 12th and 13th century. The Templar of Tyre described the faster firing traction trebuchets as more dangerous to the defenders than the counterweight ones. The Song dynasty described countermeasures against counterweight trebuchets that prevented them from damaging towers and houses: \"an extraordinary method was invented of neutralising the effects of the enemy's trebuchets. Ropes of rice straw four inches thick and thirty-four feet long were joined together twenty at a time, draped on to the buildings from top to bottom, and covered with [wet] clay. Then neither the incendiary arrows, nor bombs [\"huo pao\"] from trebuchets, nor even stones of a hundred \"jun\" caused any damage to the towers and houses.\"\nThe counterweight trebuchet did not completely replace the traction trebuchet. Despite its greater range, counterweight trebuchets had to be constructed close to the site of the siege unlike traction trebuchets, which were smaller, lighter, cheaper, and easier to take apart and put back together again where necessary. The superiority of the counterweight trebuchet was not clear cut. Of this, the Hongwu Emperor stated in 1388: \"The old type of trebuchet was really more convenient. If you have a hundred of those machines, then when you are ready to march, each wooden pole can be carried by only four men. Then when you reach your destination, you encircle the city, set them up, and start shooting!\" The traction trebuchet continued to serve as an anti-personnel weapon. The Norwegian text of 1240, \"Speculum regale\", explicitly states this division of functions. Traction trebuchets were to be used for hitting people in undefended areas. At the siege of Acre (1291), both traction and counterweight trebuchets were used. The traction trebuchets provided cover fire while the counterweight trebuchets destroyed the city's fortifications. The counterweight-trebuchet could also be used for cover fire and as an anti-personnel weapon. King James I of Aragon employed this as a defensive tactic in many fortified structures and towns which proved effective. Trebuchets could cause mass casualties due to the destruction of structures. During an assault on Muntcada by King James I, a trebuchet was used to target a tower, destroying the structure and causing the consequential deaths of civilians and livestock. But typically the counterweight trebuchet was used against battlements such as parapets, other defensive structures, and the lower section of walls due to its greater accuracy and longer range, which was how it was employed by the Kingdom of Aragon.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Rather than replace traction trebuchets, counterweight trebuchets supplemented them in a different role. Their slower shooting rate and greater mass made them more difficult to reposition, or even yaw, leaving few incentives to employ a small counterweight engine rather than a comparable traction type. Although less accurate, traction trebuchets might be expected to achieve the same result, albeit with more shots, in a similar amount of time. Accordingly, it was only profitable to employ counterweight trebuchets if they were capable of harnessing noticeably more energy, allowing them to throw significantly larger stones or similarly sized stones greater distances.\u2014\u200a\nThere is some evidence that the counterweight trebuchet could be transported. Armies employed a magister tormentorum ('master of trebuchets') for the reconstruction of trebuchets after they were deconstructed for transportation to their destination, whether on carts or by ship. They could also be equipped with their own wheels, as shown in two 17th- and 18th-century Chinese illustrations, which are also the only Chinese depictions of counterweight trebuchets on land. According to Liang Jieming, the \"illustration shows\u00a0... its throwing arm disassembled, its counterweight locked with supporting braces, and prepped for transport and not in battle deployment.\" However, according to Joseph Needham, the large tank in the middle was the counterweight, while the bulb at the end of the arm was for adjusting between fixed and swinging counterweights. Both Liang and Needham note that the illustrations are poorly drawn and confusing, leading to mislabeling.\nThe counterweight and traction trebuchets were phased out around the mid-15th century in favor of gunpowder weapons.\nDecline of military use.\nWith the introduction of gunpowder, the trebuchet began to lose its place as the siege engine of choice to the cannon. Trebuchets were still used both at the siege of Burgos (1475\u20131476) and siege of Rhodes (1480). One of the last recorded military uses was by Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, at the 1521 siege of the Aztec capital Tenochtitl\u00e1n. Accounts of the attack note that its use was motivated by the limited supply of gunpowder. The attempt was reportedly unsuccessful: the first projectile landed on the trebuchet itself, destroying it.\nIn China, the last time trebuchets were seriously considered for military purposes was in 1480. Not much is heard of them afterwards.\nOther trebuchets.\nHand-trebuchet.\nThe hand-trebuchet () was a staff sling mounted on a pole using a lever mechanism to propel projectiles. Basically a one-man traction trebuchet, it was used by troops of emperor Nikephoros II Phokas around 965 to disrupt enemy formations in the open field. It was also mentioned in the Taktika of general Nikephoros Ouranos (c. 1000), and listed in \"De obsidione toleranda\" (author anonymous) as a form of artillery.\nIn China, the hand-trebuchet (\"shoupao\") was invented by Liu Yongxi and presented to the emperor in 1002. It was a pole with a pin at its upper end that acted as a fulcrum for the arm. The pole was used as a shot for fixing in the ground and the user could then throw missiles at the enemy from a static position.\nHybrid trebuchet.\nAccording to Paul E. Chevedden, a hybrid trebuchet existed that used both counterweight and human propulsion. However no illustrations or descriptions of the device exist from the time when they were supposed to have been used. The entire argument for the existence of hybrid trebuchets rests on accounts of increasingly more effective siege weapons. Peter Purton suggests that this was simply because the machines became larger. The earliest depiction of a hybrid trebuchet is dated to 1462, when trebuchets had already become obsolete due to cannons.\nCouillard.\nThe couillard is a smaller version of a counterweight trebuchet with a single frame instead of the usual double \"A\" frames. The counterweight is split into two halves to avoid hitting the center frame.\nModern use.\nRecreation and education.\nMost trebuchet use in recent centuries has been for recreational or educational, rather than military purposes. New machines have been constructed and old ones restored by living history enthusiasts, for historical re-enactments, and use in other historical celebrations. As their construction is substantially simpler than modern weapons, trebuchets also serve as the object of engineering challenges.\nThe methods of trebuchet construction were lost at the beginning of the 16th century. In 1984, the French engineer Renaud Beffeyte made the first modern reconstruction of a trebuchet, based on documents from 1324.\nThe largest currently-functioning trebuchet in the world is the machine at Warwick Castle, England, constructed in 2005. Based on historical designs, it stands tall and throws missiles typically 36\u00a0kg (80\u00a0lbs) up to . The trebuchet gained significant interest from numerous news sources when in 2015 a burning missile fired from the siege engine struck and damaged a Victorian-era boathouse situated at the River Avon close by, inadvertently demonstrating the weapon's power. It is built on the design of a similar trebuchet at Middelaldercentret in Denmark. In 1989, Middelaldercentret became the first place in the modern era to have a working trebuchet.\nTrebuchets compete in one of the classifications of machines used to hurl pumpkins at the annual pumpkin chucking contest held in Sussex County, Delaware, U.S. The record-holder in that contest for trebuchets is the Yankee Siege II from New Hampshire, which at the 2013 WCPC Championship tossed a pumpkin 2835.8\u00a0ft (864.35 metres). The , trebuchet flings the standard pumpkins, specified for all entries in the WCPC competition.\nA large trebuchet was tested in late 2017 in Belfast as part of the set for the television series \"Game of Thrones\".\nA large trebuchet based on Edward I's \"Warwolf\" was constructed for a scene in David Mackenzie's movie \"Outlaw King\" (2018) about Robert the Bruce, King of Scots. During the film, it hurls an incendiary projectile at Stirling Castle. It recreates the true story that it took some three months to build and Edward would not let his enemy surrender until he could use it.\nIn recent years several trebuchets has been created capable of throwing cars. In the episode \"Carnage A Trois\" in series 4 of \"The Grand Tour\" the presenters uses a trebuchet to allegedly sling a Citro\u00ebn C3 Pluriel from the White Cliffs of Dover across the English Channel. The Stamford based YouTube personality and inventor Colin Furze created a high trebuchet capable of throwing a washing machine in December 2020.\nDevelopments.\nAlthough rarely used as a weapon today, trebuchets maintain the interest of professional and hobbyist engineers. One modern technological development, especially for the competitive pumpkin-hurling events, is the \"floating arms\" design. Instead of using the traditional axle fixed to a frame, these devices are mounted on wheels that roll on a track parallel to the ground, with a counterweight that falls directly downward upon release, allowing for greater efficiency by increasing the proportion of energy transferred to the projectile. A more radical design; Jonathan, Orion, and Emmerson Stapleton's \"walking arm\", described as \"a stick falling over with a huge counterweight on top of the stick\" debuted in 2016 and in 2018 won both the Grand Champion Best Design and Middleweight Open Division of the 10th annual Vermont Pumpkin Chuckin Festival. Another recent development is the \"flywheel trebuchet\", in which a flywheel is spun into rapid rotation to build up momentum before release.\nUses in activism and insurgency.\nIn 2013, during the Syrian civil war, rebels were filmed using a trebuchet in the Battle of Aleppo. The trebuchet was used to project explosives at government troops.\nIn 2014, during the Hrushevskoho street riots in Ukraine, rioters used an improvised trebuchet to throw bricks and Molotov cocktails at the Berkut.\nUses in regular armies.\nIn 2024, the IDF used a trebuchet to hurl flaming projectiles into Lebanon. IDF media stated the goal was to target natural features such as brush and thicket along the Lebanon-Israel border wall that hypothetically could have been used as cover by Hezbollah troops. The IDF later issued a response to suggest that the trebuchet's use was a \"local initiative\", instigated by a brigade that had not yet been deployed to Gaza, rather than a widely used tool in the Israeli military.\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "43382", "revid": "51061792", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43382", "title": "Zenobia", "text": "Empress of Palmyra in 272\nSeptimia Zenobia (; c.\u2009240 \u2013 c.\u2009274) was a third-century queen of the Palmyrene Empire in Syria. Many legends surround her ancestry; she was probably not a commoner, and she married Odaenathus, the ruler of the city of Palmyra. Her husband became king of Palmyra in 260, elevating Palmyra to supreme power in the Near East by defeating the Sasanian Empire of Persia and stabilizing the Roman East. After Odaenathus' assassination in 267, Zenobia became the regent of her son Vaballathus and held \"de facto\" power throughout his reign (267 to 272).\nIn 270, Zenobia launched an invasion that brought most of the Roman East under her sway and culminated with the annexation of Egypt. By mid-271 her realm extended from Ancyra, central Anatolia, to Upper Egypt, although she remained nominally subordinate to Rome. However, in reaction to the campaign of the Roman emperor Aurelian in 272, Zenobia declared her son emperor and assumed the title of empress, thus declaring Palmyra's secession from Rome. The Romans were victorious after heavy fighting; the empress was besieged in her capital and captured in late 272 by Aurelian, who exiled her to Rome, where she spent the remainder of her life.\nZenobia was a cultured monarch and fostered an intellectual environment in her court, which was open to scholars and philosophers. She was tolerant toward her subjects and protected religious minorities. The empress maintained a stable administration, which governed a multicultural, multiethnic empire. Zenobia died after 274, and many tales have been recorded about her fate. Her rise and fall have inspired historians, artists and novelists, and she is a patriotic symbol in Syria.\nName, appearance and sources.\nZenobia was born c. 240\u2013241, and bore the gentilicium (surname) Septimia. Her native Palmyrene name was Bat-Zabbai (written \"Btzby\" in the Palmyrene alphabet), an Aramaic name meaning \"daughter of Zabbai\". Such compound names for women were common in Palmyra, where the element \"bt\" means daughter, but the personal name that follows does not necessarily denote the immediate father, rather referring to the ancestor of the family. In Greek\u2014Palmyra's diplomatic and second language, used in many Palmyrene inscriptions\u2014she used the name Zenobia. In Palmyra, when written in Greek, names such as Zabeida, Zabdila, Zabbai or Zabda were often transformed into \"Zenobios\" (masculine) and \"Zenobia\" (feminine). The element \"Zabbai\" from Zenobia's native name means \"gift of N.N. [god]\", and the name Zenobia translates to \"one whose life derives from Zeus\". The historian Victor Duruy believed that the queen used the Greek name as a translation of her native name, in deference to her Greek subjects. The philologist Wilhelm Dittenberger argued that the name Bat-Zabbai underwent a detortum (twist), thus resulting in the name Zenobia.\nThe ninth-century historian al-Tabari, in his highly fictionalized account, wrote that the queen's name was Na'ila al-Zabba'. Manichaean sources, reporting the visit of the apostle Addai to the region during the time of Odaenathus, called Zenobia \"Queen Tadi\", wife of kysr (caesar). The name given to Zenobia in those Manichaean writings seems to derive from Tadmor, Palmyra's native name, and this is supported by the Coptic \"Acts Codex\", where Zenobia is named Queen Thadmor.\nNo contemporary statues of Zenobia have been found in Palmyra or elsewhere, only inscriptions on statues bases survive, indicating that a statue of the queen once stood in the place; most known representations of Zenobia are the idealized portraits of her found on her coins. Sculptures of Palmyrene style were normally impersonal, unlike Greek and Roman ones: a statue of Zenobia in this style would have given an idea of her general style in dress and jewelry but would not have revealed her true appearance. The non-contemporary historian Edward Gibbon has described her as being \u201cof a dark complexion\u201d and considered \u201cmost lovely,\u201d and that she \u201cequalled in beauty her [claimed] ancestor Cleopatra.\u201d British scholar William Wright visited Palmyra toward the end of the nineteenth century in a vain search for a sculpture of the queen.\nIn addition to archaeological evidence, Zenobia's life was recorded in different ancient sources but many are flawed or fabricated; the \"Historia Augusta\", a late-Roman collection of biographies, is the most notable (albeit unreliable) source for the era. The author (or authors) of the \"Historia Augusta\" invented many events and letters attributed to Zenobia in the absence of contemporary sources. Some \"Historia Augusta\" accounts are corroborated from other sources, and are more credible. The Byzantine chronicler Joannes Zonaras is considered an important source for the life of Zenobia.\nOrigin, family and early life.\nPalmyrene society was an amalgam of Semitic-speaking peoples, mostly Arabs and Arameans, and Zenobia cannot be identified with any one group; as a Palmyrene, she may have had both Arab and Aramean ancestry. Information about Zenobia's ancestry and immediate family connections is scarce and contradictory. Nothing is known about her mother, and her father's identity is debated. Manichaean sources mention a \"Nafsha\", sister of the \"queen of Palmyra\", but those sources are confused and \"Nafsha\" may refer to Zenobia herself: it is doubtful that Zenobia had a sister.\nApparently not a commoner, Zenobia would have received an education appropriate for a noble Palmyrene girl. The \"Historia Augusta\" contains details of her early life, although their veracity is dubious; according to the \"Historia Augusta\", the queen's hobby as a child was hunting and, in addition to her Palmyrene Aramaic mother tongue, she was fluent in Egyptian and Greek and spoke Latin. When she was about fourteen years old (ca. 255), Zenobia became the second wife of Odaenathus, the \"ras\" (\"lord\") of Palmyra. Noble families in Palmyra often intermarried, and it is probable that Zenobia and Odaenathus shared some ancestors.\nContemporary epigraphical evidence.\nBasing their suppositions upon archaeological evidence, various historians have suggested several men as Zenobia's father:\nJulius Aurelius Zenobius appears on a Palmyrene inscription as a strategos of Palmyra in 231\u2013232; based on the similarity of the names, Zenobius was suggested as Zenobia's father by the numismatist and others. The archaeologist William Waddington argued in favor of Zenobius' identification as the father, assuming that his statue stood opposite to where the statue of the queen stood in Great Colonnade. However, the linguist Jean-Baptiste Chabot pointed out that Zenobius' statue stood opposite to that of Odaenathus not Zenobia and rejected Waddington's hypothesis. The only \"gentilicium\", a hereditary name borne by people that was originally the name of one's gens (family or clan) by patrilineal descent, appearing on Zenobia's inscriptions was \"Septimia\" (not \"Julia Aurelia\", which she would have borne if her father's \"gentilicium\" was Aurelius), and it cannot be proven that the queen changed her \"gentilicium\" to Septimia after her marriage.\nOne of Zenobia's inscriptions recorded her as \"Septimia Bat-Zabbai, daughter of Antiochus\". Antiochus' identity is not definitively known: his ancestry is not recorded in Palmyrene inscriptions, and the name was not common in Palmyra. This, combined with the meaning of Zenobia's Palmyrene name (daughter of Zabbai), led scholars such as to speculate that Antiochus might have been a distant ancestor: the Seleucid king Antiochus IV Epiphanes or Antiochus VII Sidetes, whose wife was the Ptolemaic Cleopatra Thea. In the historian Richard Stoneman's view, Zenobia would not have created an obscure ancestry to connect herself with the ancient Macedonian rulers: if a fabricated ancestry were needed, a more direct connection would have been invented. According to Stoneman, Zenobia \"had reason to believe [her Seleucid ancestry] to be true\". The historian Patricia Southern, noting that Antiochus was mentioned without a royal title or a hint of great lineage, believes that he was a direct ancestor or a relative rather than a Seleucid king who lived three centuries before Zenobia.\nOn the basis of Zenobia's Palmyrene name, Bat Zabbai, her father may have been called Zabbai; alternatively, Zabbai may have been the name of a more distant ancestor. The historian Trevor Bryce suggests that she was related to Septimius Zabbai, Palmyra's garrison leader, and he may even have been her father. The archaeologist Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau, attempting to reconcile the meaning of the name \"Bat Zabbai\" with the inscription mentioning the queen as daughter of Antiochus, suggested that two brothers, Zabbai and Antiochus, existed, with a childless Zabbai dying and leaving his widow to marry his brother Antiochus. Thus, since Zenobia was born out of a levirate marriage, she was theoretically the daughter of Zabbai, hence the name.\nAncient sources.\nIn the \"Historia Augusta\", Zenobia is said to have been a descendant of Cleopatra and claimed descent from the Ptolemies. According to the \"Souda\", a 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia, after the Palmyrene conquest of Egypt, the sophist Callinicus of Petra wrote a ten-volume history of Alexandria dedicated to Cleopatra. According to modern scholars, by Cleopatra Callinicus meant Zenobia. Apart from legends, there is no direct evidence in Egyptian coinage or papyri of a contemporary conflation of Zenobia with Cleopatra. The connection may have been invented by Zenobia's enemies to discredit her, but circumstantial evidence indicates that Zenobia herself made the claim; an imperial declaration once ascribed to Emperor Severus Alexander (died 235) was probably made by Zenobia in the name of her son Vaballathus, where the king named Alexandria \"my ancestral city\", which indicates a claim to Ptolemaic ancestry. Zenobia's alleged claim of a connection to Cleopatra seems to have been politically motivated, since it would have given her a connection with Egypt and made her a legitimate successor to the Ptolemies' throne. A relationship between Zenobia and the Ptolemies is unlikely, and attempts by classical sources to trace the queen's ancestry to the Ptolemies through the Seleucids are apocryphal.\nArab traditions and al-Zabba'.\nAlthough some Arab historians linked Zenobia to the Queen of Sheba, their accounts are apocryphal. Medieval Arabic traditions identify a queen of Palmyra named al-Zabba', and her most romantic account comes from al-Tabari. According to al-Tabari, she was an Amalekite; her father was 'Amr ibn Zarib, an 'Am\u0101l\u012bq sheikh who was killed by the Tanukhids. Al-Tabari identifies a sister of al-Zabba' as \"Zabibah\". Jadhimah ibn Malik, the Tanukhid king who killed the queen's father, was killed by al-Zabba'. According to al-Tabari, al-Zabba' had a fortress along the Euphrates and ruled Palmyra.\nAl-Tabari's account does not mention the Romans, Odaenathus, Vaballathus or the Sassanians; focusing on the tribes and their relations, it is immersed in legends. Although the account is certainly based on the story of Zenobia, it is probably conflated with the story of a semi-legendary nomadic Arab queen (or queens). Al-Zabba''s fortress was probably Halabiye, which was restored by the historic Palmyrene queen and named Zenobia.\nQueen of Palmyra.\nConsort.\nDuring the early centuries AD, Palmyra was a city subordinate to Rome and part of the province of Syria Phoenice. In 260 the Roman emperor Valerian marched against the Sassanid Persian monarch Shapur I, who had invaded the empire's eastern regions; Valerian was defeated and captured near Edessa. Odaenathus, formally loyal to Rome and its emperor Gallienus (Valerian's son), was declared king of Palmyra. Launching successful campaigns against Persia, he was crowned King of Kings of the East in 263. Odaenathus crowned his eldest son, Herodianus, as co-ruler. In addition to the royal titles, Odaenathus received many Roman titles, most importantly \"corrector totius orientis\" (governor of the entire East), and ruled the Roman territories from the Black Sea to Palestine. In 267, when Zenobia was in her late twenties or early thirties, Odaenathus and his eldest son were assassinated while returning from a campaign.\nThe first inscription mentioning Zenobia as queen is dated two or three years after Odaenathus' death, so exactly when Zenobia assumed the title \"queen of Palmyra\" is uncertain. However, she was probably designated as queen when her husband became king. As queen consort, Zenobia remained in the background and was not mentioned in the historical record. According to later accounts, including one by Giovanni Boccaccio, she accompanied her husband on his campaigns. If the accounts of her accompanying her husband are true, according to Southern, Zenobia would have boosted the morale of the soldiers and gained political influence, which she needed in her later career.\nPossible role in Odaenathus' assassination.\nAccording to the \"Historia Augusta\", Odaenathus was assassinated by a cousin named Maeonius. In the \"Historia Augusta\", Odaenathus' son from his first wife was named Herodes and was crowned co-ruler by his father. The \"Historia Augusta\" claims that Zenobia conspired with Maeonius for a time because she did not accept her stepson as his father's heir (ahead of her own children). The \"Historia Augusta\" does not suggest that Zenobia was involved in the events leading to her husband's murder, and the crime is attributed to Maeonius' moral degeneration and jealousy. This account, according to the historian Alaric Watson, can be dismissed as fictional. Although some modern scholarship suggests that Zenobia was involved in the assassination due to political ambition and opposition to her husband's pro-Roman policy, she continued Odaenathus' policies during her first years on the throne.\nRegent.\nIn the \"Historia Augusta \", Maeonius was emperor briefly before he was killed by his soldiers, however, no inscriptions or evidence exist for his reign. At the time of Odaenathus' assassination, Zenobia might have been with her husband; according to chronicler George Syncellus, he was killed near Heraclea Pontica in Bithynia. The transfer of power seems to have been smooth, since Syncellus reports that the time from the assassination to the army handing the crown to Zenobia was one day. Zenobia may have been in Palmyra, but this would have reduced the likelihood of a smooth transition; the soldiers might have chosen one of their officers, so the first scenario of her being with her husband is more likely. The historical records are unanimous that Zenobia did not fight for supremacy and there is no evidence of delay in the transfer of the throne to Odaenathus and Zenobia's son, the ten-year-old Vaballathus. Although she never claimed to rule in her own right and acted as a regent for her son, Zenobia held the reins of power in the kingdom, and Vaballathus was kept in his mother's shadow, never exercising real power.\nConsolidation of power.\nThe Palmyrene monarchy was new; allegiance was based on loyalty to Odaenathus, making the transfer of power to a successor more difficult than it would have been in an established monarchy. Odaenathus tried to ensure the dynasty's future by crowning his eldest son co-king, but both were assassinated. Zenobia, left to secure the Palmyrene succession and retain the loyalty of its subjects, emphasized the continuity between her late husband and his successor (her son). Vaballathus (with Zenobia orchestrating the process) assumed his father's royal titles immediately, and his earliest known inscription records him as King of Kings.\nOdaenathus controlled a large area of the Roman East, and held the highest political and military authority in the region, superseding that of the Roman provincial governors. His self-created status was formalized by Emperor Gallienus, who had little choice but to acquiesce. Odaenathus's power relative to that of the emperor and the central authority was unprecedented and elastic, but relations remained smooth until his death. His assassination meant that the Palmyrene rulers' authority and position had to be clarified, which led to a conflict over their interpretation. The Roman court viewed Odaenathus as an appointed Roman official who derived his power from the emperor, but the Palmyrene court saw his position as hereditary. This conflict was the first step on the road to war between Rome and Palmyra.\nOdaenathus' Roman titles, such as \"dux Romanorum\", \"corrector totius orientis\" and \"imperator totius orientis\" differed from his royal eastern ones because the Roman ranks were not hereditary. Vaballathus had a legitimate claim to his royal titles, but had no right to the Roman ones\u2014especially \"corrector\" (denoting a senior military and provincial commander in the Roman system), which Zenobia used for her son in his earliest known inscriptions with \"King of Kings\". Although the Roman emperors accepted the royal succession, the assumption of Roman military rank antagonized the empire. Emperor Gallienus may have decided to intervene in an attempt to regain central authority; according to the \"Historia Augusta\", praetorian prefect Aurelius Heraclianus was dispatched to assert imperial authority over the east and was repelled by the Palmyrene army. The account is doubtful, however, since Heraclianus participated in Gallienus' assassination in 268. Odaenathus was assassinated shortly before the emperor, and Heraclianus would have been unable to be sent to the East, fight the Palmyrenes and return to the West in time to become involved in the conspiracy against the emperor.\nEarly reign.\nThe extent of Zenobia's territorial control during her early reign is debated; according to the historian Fergus Millar, her authority was confined to Palmyra and Emesa until 270. If this was the case, the events of 270 (which saw Zenobia's conquest of the Levant and Egypt) are extraordinary. It is more likely that the queen ruled the territories controlled by her late husband, a view supported by Southern and the historian , and backed by ancient sources (such as the Roman historian Eutropius, who wrote that the queen inherited her husband's power). The \"Historia Augusta\" also mentioned that Zenobia took control of the East during Gallienus' reign. Further evidence of extended territorial control was a statement by the Byzantine historian Zosimus, who wrote that the queen had a residence in Antioch.\nThere is no recorded unrest against the queen accompanying her ascendance in ancient sources hostile to her, indicating no serious opposition to the new regime. The most obvious candidates for opposition were the Roman provincial governors, but the sources do not say that Zenobia marched on any of them or that they tried to remove her from the throne. According to Hartmann, the governors and military leaders of the eastern provinces apparently acknowledged and supported Vaballathus as the successor of Odaenathus. During Zenobia's early regency, she focused on safeguarding the borders with Persia and pacifying the Tanukhids in Hauran. To protect the Persian borders, the queen fortified many settlements on the Euphrates (including the citadels of Halabiye\u2014later called Zenobia\u2014and Zalabiye). Circumstantial evidence exists for confrontations with the Sassanid Persians; probably in 269, Vaballathus assumed the victory title of \"Persicus Maximus\" (the great victor in Persia); this may be connected to an unrecorded battle against a Persian army trying to control northern Mesopotamia.\nExpansion.\nIn 269, while Claudius Gothicus (Gallienus' successor) was defending the borders of Italy and the Balkans against Germanic invasions, Zenobia was cementing her authority; Roman officials in the East were caught between loyalty to the emperor and Zenobia's increasing demands for allegiance. The timing and rationale of the queen's decision to use military force to strengthen her authority in the East is unclear; scholar Gary K. Young suggested that Roman officials refused to recognize Palmyrene authority, and Zenobia's expeditions were intended to maintain Palmyrene dominance. Another factor may have been the weakness of Roman central authority and its corresponding inability to protect the provinces, which probably convinced Zenobia that the only way to maintain stability in the East was to control the region directly. The historian Jacques Schwartz tied Zenobia's actions to her desire to protect Palmyra's economic interests, which were threatened by Rome's failure to protect the provinces. Also, according to Schwartz, the economic interests conflicted; Bostra and Egypt received trade which would have otherwise passed through Palmyra. The Tanukhids near Bostra and the merchants of Alexandria probably attempted to rid themselves of Palmyrene domination, triggering a military response from Zenobia.\nSyria and the invasion of Arabia Petraea.\nIn the spring of 270, while Claudius was fighting the Goths in the mountains of Thrace, Zenobia sent her general Septimius Zabdas to Bosra (capital of the province of Arabia Petraea); the queen's timing seems intentional. In Arabia the Roman governor (\"dux\"), Trassus (commanding the Legio III Cyrenaica), confronted the Palmyrenes and was routed and killed. Zabdas sacked the city, and destroyed the temple of Zeus Hammon, the legion's revered shrine. A Latin inscription after the fall of Zenobia attests to its destruction: \"The temple of Iuppiter Hammon, destroyed by the Palmyrene enemies, which\u00a0... rebuilt, with a silver statue and iron doors (?)\". The city of Umm el-Jimal may have also been destroyed by the Palmyrenes in connection with their efforts to subjugate the Tanukhids.\nAfter his victory, Zabdas marched south along the Jordan Valley and apparently met little opposition. There is evidence that Petra was attacked by a small contingent which penetrated the region. Arabia and Judaea were eventually subdued. Palmyrene dominance of Arabia is confirmed by many milestones bearing Vaballathus' name. Syrian subjugation required less effort because Zenobia had substantial support there, particularly in Antioch, Syria's traditional capital. The invasion of Arabia coincided with the cessation of coin production in Claudius' name by the Antiochean mint, indicating that Zenobia had begun tightening her grip on Syria. By November 270, the mint began issuing coinage in Vaballathus' name.\nThe Arabian milestones presented the Palmyrene king as a Roman governor and commander, referring to him as \"vir clarissimus rex consul imperator dux Romanorum\". The assumption of such titles was probably meant to legitimize Zenobia's control of the province, not yet a usurpation of the imperial title. Until now, Zenobia could say that she was acting as a representative of the emperor (who was securing the eastern lands of the empire) while the Roman monarch was preoccupied with struggles in Europe. Although Vaballathus' use of the titles amounted to a claim to the imperial throne, Zenobia could still justify them and maintain a mask of subordination to Rome; an \"imperator\" was a commander of troops, not the equal of an emperor (\"imperator caesar augustus\").\nAnnexation of Egypt and the campaigns in Asia Minor.\nThe invasion of Egypt is sometimes explained by Zenobia's desire to secure an alternative trade route to the Euphrates, which was cut because of the war with Persia. This theory ignores the fact that the Euphrates route was only partially disrupted, and overlooks Zenobia's ambition. The date of the campaign is uncertain; Zosimus placed it after the Battle of Naissus and before Claudius' death, which sets it in the summer of 270. Watson, emphasizing the works of Zonaras and Syncellus and dismissing Zosimus' account, places the invasion in October 270 (after Claudius' death). According to Watson, the occupation of Egypt was an opportunistic move by Zenobia (who was encouraged by the news of Claudius' death in August). Zenobia was declared Queen of Egypt after Palmyrene invasion of Egypt. The image of Selene on the reverse of the coins of Zenobia minted in Alexandria symbolized Zenobia's claim as a descendant and inheritor of Cleopatra VII to legitimize her rule. The appearance of the Palmyrenes on Egypt's eastern frontier would have contributed to unrest in the province, whose society was fractured; Zenobia had supporters and opponents among local Egyptians.\nThe Roman position was worsened by the absence of Egypt's prefect, Tenagino Probus, who was battling pirates. According to Zosimus, the Palmyrenes were helped by an Egyptian general named Timagenes; Zabdas moved into Egypt with 70,000 soldiers, defeating an army of 50,000 Romans. After their victory, the Palmyrenes withdrew their main force and left a 5,000-soldier garrison. By early November, Tenagino Probus returned and assembled an army; he expelled the Palmyrenes and regained Alexandria, prompting Zabdas to return. The Palmyrene general aimed a thrust at Alexandria, where he seems to have had local support; the city fell into Zabdas' hands, and the Roman prefect fled south. The last battle was at the Babylon Fortress, where Tenagino Probus took refuge; the Romans had the upper hand, since they chose their camp carefully. Timagenes, with his knowledge of the land, ambushed the Roman rear; Tenagino Probus committed suicide, and Egypt became part of Palmyra. In the \"Historia Augusta \" the Blemmyes were among Zenobia's allies, and Gary K. Young cites the Blemmyes attack and occupation of Coptos in 268 as evidence of a Palmyrene-Blemmyes alliance.\nOnly Zosimus mentioned two invasions, contrasting with many scholars who argue in favor of an initial invasion and no retreat (followed by a reinforcement, which took Alexandria by the end of 270). During the Egyptian campaign, Rome was entangled in a succession crisis between Claudius' brother Quintillus and the general Aurelian. Egyptian papyri and coinage confirm Palmyrene rule in Egypt; the papyri stopped using the regnal years of the emperors from September to November 270, due to the succession crisis. By December regnal dating was resumed, with the papyri using the regnal years of the prevailing emperor Aurelian and Zenobia's son Vaballathus. Egyptian coinage was issued in the names of Aurelian and the Palmyrene king by November 270. There is no evidence that Zenobia ever visited Egypt.\nAlthough the operation may have commenced under Septimius Zabbai, Zabdas' second-in-command, the invasion of Asia Minor did not fully begin until Zabdas' arrival in the spring of 271. The Palmyrenes annexed Galatia and, according to Zosimus, reached Ancyra. Bithynia and the Cyzicus mint remained beyond Zenobia's control, and her attempts to subdue Chalcedon failed. The Asia Minor campaign is poorly documented, but the western part of the region did not become part of the queen's authority; no coins with Zenobia or Vaballathus' portraits were minted in Asia Minor, and no royal Palmyrene inscriptions have been found. By August 271 Zabdas was back in Palmyra, with the Palmyrene empire at its zenith.\nGovernance.\nZenobia ruled an empire of different peoples; as a Palmyrene, she was accustomed to dealing with multilingual and multicultural diversity since she hailed from a city which embraced many cults. The queen's realm was culturally divided into eastern-Semitic and Hellenistic zones; Zenobia tried to appease both, and seems to have successfully appealed to the region's ethnic, cultural and political groups. The queen projected an image of a Syrian monarch, a Hellenistic queen and a Roman empress, which gained broad support for her cause.\nCulture.\nZenobia turned her court into a center of learning, with many intellectuals and sophists reported in Palmyra during her reign. As academics migrated to the city, it replaced classical learning centers such as Athens for Syrians. The best-known court philosopher was Longinus, who arrived during Odaenathus' reign and became Zenobia's tutor in \"paideia\" (aristocratic education). Many historians, including Zosimus, accused Longinus of influencing the queen to oppose Rome. This view presents the queen as malleable, but, according to Southern, Zenobia's actions \"cannot be laid entirely at Longinus' door\". Other intellectuals associated with the court included Nicostratus of Trapezus and Callinicus of Petra.\nFrom the second to the fourth centuries, Syrian intellectuals argued that Greek culture did not evolve in Greece but was adapted from the Near East. According to Iamblichus, the great Greek philosophers reused Near Eastern and Egyptian ideas. The Palmyrene court was probably dominated by this school of thought, with an intellectual narrative presenting Palmyra's dynasty as a Roman imperial one succeeding the Persian, Seleucid and Ptolemaic rulers who controlled the region in which Hellenistic culture allegedly originated. Nicostratus wrote a history of the Roman Empire from Philip the Arab to Odaenathus, presenting the latter as a legitimate imperial successor and contrasting his successes with the disastrous reigns of the emperors.\nZenobia embarked on several restoration projects in Egypt. One of the Colossi of Memnon was reputed in antiquity to sing; the sound was probably due to cracks in the statue, with solar rays interacting with dew in the cracks. The historian Glen Bowersock proposed that the queen restored the colossus (\"silencing\" it), which would explain third-century accounts of the singing and their disappearance in the fourth.\nReligion.\nZenobia followed the Palmyrene paganism, where a number of Semitic gods, with Bel at the head of the pantheon, were worshipped. Zenobia accommodated Christians and Jews, and ancient sources made many claims about the queen's beliefs; Manichaean sources alleged that Zenobia was one of their own; a manuscript dated to 272 mentions that the Queen of Palmyra supported the Manichaeans in establishing a community in Abidar, which was under the rule of a king named Amar\u014d, who could be the Lakhmid king Amr ibn Adi. It is more likely, however, that Zenobia tolerated all cults in an effort to attract support from groups marginalized by Rome.\nBishop Athanasius of Alexandria wrote that Zenobia did not \"hand over churches to the Jews to make them into synagogues\"; although the queen was not a Christian, she understood the power of bishops in Christian communities. In Antioch\u2014considered representative of political control of the East and containing a large Christian community\u2014Zenobia apparently maintained authority over the church by bringing influential clerics, probably including Paul of Samosata, under her auspices. She may have bestowed on Paul the rank of \"ducenarius\" (minor judge); he apparently enjoyed the queen's protection, which helped him keep the diocesan church after he was removed from his office as bishop of Antioch by a synod of bishops in 268. Hughes \nsuggested that Paul's position while Zenobia ruled was in the state treasury.\nJudaism.\nLess than a hundred years after Zenobia's reign, Athanasius of Alexandria called her a \"Jewess\" in his \"History of the Arians\". In 391, archbishop John Chrysostom wrote that Zenobia was Jewish; so did a Syriac chronicler around 664 and bishop Bar Hebraeus in the thirteenth century. According to French scholar Javier Teixidor, Zenobia was probably a proselyte; this explained her strained relationship with the rabbis. Teixidor believed that Zenobia became interested in Judaism when Longinus spoke about the philosopher Porphyry and his interest in the Old Testament. Although Talmudic sources were hostile to Palmyra because of Odaenathus' suppression of the Jews of Nehardea, Zenobia apparently had the support of some Jewish communities (particularly in Alexandria). In Cairo, a plaque originally bearing an inscription confirming a grant of immunity to a Jewish synagogue in the last quarter of the first millennium BC by King Ptolemy Euergetes (I or II) was found. At a much later date, the plaque was re-inscribed to commemorate the restoration of immunity \"on the orders of the queen and king\" and the precedence of the queen in the ordering of the two titles is remarkable. Although it is undated, the letters of the inscription date to long after Cleopatra and Anthony's era; Zenobia and her nominal co-monarch Vaballathus, who controlled Egypt in 270\u2013272, are the only candidates for a king and a queen ruling Egypt after the Ptolemies.\nThe historian E. Mary Smallwood wrote that good relations with the diaspora community did not mean that the Jews of Palestine were content with Zenobia's reign, and her rule was apparently opposed in that region. The Jerusalem Talmud, in Tractate Terumot tells the story of the amoraim Rabbi \"Ammi\" and Rabbi \"Samuel bar Nahmani\", who visited Zenobia's court and asked for the release of a Jew (\"Zeir bar Hinena\") detained on her orders. The queen refused, saying: \"Why have you come to save him? He teaches that your creator performs miracles for you. Why not let God save him?\" During Aurelian's destruction of Palmyra, Palestinian conscripts with \"clubs and cudgels\" (who may have been Jews) played a vital role in Zenobia's defeat and the destruction of her city.\nThere is no evidence of Zenobia's birth as a Jew; the names of her and her husband's families belonged to the Aramaic onomasticon (collection of names). The queen's alleged patronage of Paul of Samosata (who was accused of \"Judaizing\"), may have given rise to the idea that she was a proselyte. Only Christian accounts note Zenobia's Jewishness; no Jewish source mentions it.\nAdministration.\nThe queen probably spent most of her reign in Antioch, Syria's administrative capital. Before the monarchy, Palmyra had the institutions of a Greek city (polis) and was ruled by a senate which was responsible for most civil affairs. Odaenathus maintained Palmyra's institutions, as did Zenobia; a Palmyrene inscription after her fall records the name of Septimius Haddudan, a Palmyrene senator. However, the queen apparently ruled autocratically; Septimius Worod, Odaenathus' viceroy and one of Palmyra's most important officials, disappeared from the record after Zenobia's ascent. The queen opened the doors of her government to Eastern nobility. Zenobia's most important courtiers and advisers were her generals, Septemius Zabdas and Septimius Zabbai; both of whom were generals under Odaenathus and received the \"gentilicium\" (surname) \"Septimius\" from him.\nOdaenathus respected the Roman emperor's privilege of appointing provincial governors, and Zenobia continued this policy during her early reign. Although the queen did not interfere in day-to-day administration, she probably had the power to command the governors in the organization of border security. During the rebellion, Zenobia maintained Roman forms of administration, but appointed the governors herself (most notably in Egypt, where Julius Marcellinus took office in 270 and was followed by Statilius Ammianus in 271).\nAgreement with Rome.\nZenobia initially avoided provoking Rome by claiming for herself and her son the titles, inherited from Odaenathus, of subject of Rome and protector of its eastern frontier. After expanding her territory, she seems to have tried to be recognized as an imperial partner in the eastern half of the empire and presented her son as subordinate to the emperor. In late 270, Zenobia minted coinage bearing the portraits of Aurelian and Vaballathus; Aurelian was titled \"emperor\", and Vaballathus \"king\". The regnal year in early samples of the coinage was only Aurelian's. By March 271, despite indicating Aurelian as the paramount monarch by naming him first in the dating formulae, the coinage also began bearing Vaballathus' regnal year. By indicating in the coinage that Vaballathus' reign began in 267 (three years before the emperor's), Vaballathus appeared to be Aurelian's senior colleague.\nThe emperor's blessing of Palmyrene authority has been debated; Aurelian's acceptance of Palmyrene rule in Egypt may be inferred from the Oxyrhynchus papyri, which are dated by the regnal years of the emperor and Vaballathus. No proof of a formal agreement exists, and the evidence is based solely on the joint coinage- and papyri-dating. It is unlikely that Aurelian would have accepted such power-sharing, but he was unable to act in 271 due to crises in the West. His apparent condoning of Zenobia's actions may have been a ruse to give her a false sense of security while he prepared for war. Another reason for Aurelian's tolerance may have been his desire to ensure a constant supply of Egyptian grain to Rome; it is not recorded that the supply was cut, and the ships sailed to Rome in 270 as usual. Some modern scholars, such as , suggest that Claudius Gothicus had concluded a formal agreement with Zenobia which Aurelian ignored.\nEmpress and open rebellion.\nAn inscription, found in Palmyra and dated to August 271, called Zenobia \"eusebes\" (the pious); this title, used by Roman empresses, could be seen as a step by the queen toward an imperial title. Another contemporary inscription called her \"sebaste\", the Greek equivalent of \"empress\" (Latin: \"Augusta\"), but also acknowledged the Roman emperor. Finally, Palmyra officially broke with Rome; the Alexandrian and Antiochian mints removed Aurelian's portrait from the coins in April 272, issuing new tetradrachms in the names of Vaballathus and Zenobia (who were called \"Augustus\" and \"Augusta\", respectively). On Zenobia's \"antoninianus\"\u00a0of 272, she appeared as a Roman ruler, depicting herself in the style of the Syrian Empresses: Julia Domna, Julia Mamaea and Julia Soaemias.\nThe assumption of imperial titles by Zenobia signaled a usurpation: independence from, and open rebellion against, Aurelian. The timeline of events and why Zenobia declared herself empress is vague. In the second half of 271, Aurelian marched to the East, but was delayed by the Goths in the Balkans; this may have alarmed the queen, driving her to claim the imperial title. Zenobia also probably understood the inevitability of open conflict with Aurelian, and decided that feigning subordination would be useless; her assumption of the imperial title was used to rally soldiers to her cause. Aurelian's campaign seems to have been the main reason for the Palmyrene imperial declaration and the removal of his portrait from its coins.\nDownfall.\nThe usurpation, which began in late March or early April 272, ended by August. Aurelian spent the winter of 271\u2013272 in Byzantium, and probably crossed the Bosporus to Asia Minor in April 272. Galatia fell easily; the Palmyrene garrisons were apparently withdrawn, and the provincial capital of Ancyra was regained without a struggle. All the cities in Asia Minor opened their doors to the Roman emperor, with only Tyana putting up some resistance before surrendering; this cleared the path for Aurelian to invade Syria, the Palmyrene heartland. A simultaneous expedition reached Egypt in May 272; by early June Alexandria was captured by the Romans, followed by the rest of Egypt by the third week of June. Zenobia seems to have withdrawn most of her armies from Egypt to focus on Syria\u2014which, if lost, would have meant the end of Palmyra.\nIn May 272, Aurelian headed toward Antioch. About north of the city, he defeated the Palmyrene army (led by Zabdas) at the Battle of Immae. As a result, Zenobia, who waited in Antioch during the battle, retreated with her army to Emesa. To conceal the disaster and make her flight safer, she spread reports that Aurelian was captured; Zabdas found a man who resembled the Roman emperor and paraded him through Antioch. The following day, Aurelian entered the city before marching south. After defeating a Palmyrene garrison south of Antioch, Aurelian continued his march to meet Zenobia in the Battle of Emesa.\nThe 70,000-strong Palmyrene army, assembled on the plain of Emesa, nearly routed the Romans. In an initial thrill of victory they hastened their advance, breaking their lines and enabling the Roman infantry to attack their flank. The defeated Zenobia headed to her capital on the advice of her war council, leaving her treasury behind. In Palmyra, the empress prepared for a siege; Aurelian blockaded food-supply routes, and there were probably unsuccessful negotiations. According to the \"Augustan History\", Zenobia said that she would fight Aurelian with the help of her Persian allies; however, the story was probably fabricated and used by the emperor to link Zenobia to Rome's greatest enemy. If such an alliance existed, a much-larger frontier war would have erupted; however, no Persian army was sent. As the situation worsened, the queen left the city for Persia intending to seek help from Palmyra's former enemy; according to Zosimus, she rode a \"female camel, the fastest of its breed and faster than any horse\".\nCaptivity and fate.\nAurelian, learning about Zenobia's departure, sent a contingent which captured the empress before she could cross the Euphrates to Persia; Palmyra capitulated soon after news of Zenobia's captivity reached the city in August 272. Aurelian sent the empress and her son to Emesa for trial, followed by most of Palmyra's court elite (including Longinus). According to the \"Augustan History\" and Zosimus, Zenobia blamed her actions on her advisers; however, there are no contemporary sources describing the trial, only later hostile Roman ones. The empress's reported cowardice in defeat was probably Aurelian's propaganda; it benefited the emperor to paint Zenobia as selfish and traitorous, discouraging the Palmyrenes from hailing her as a hero. Although Aurelian had most of his prisoners executed, he spared the empress and her son to parade her in his planned triumph.\nZenobia's fate after Emesa is uncertain since ancient historians left conflicting accounts. Zosimus wrote that she died before crossing the Bosporus on her way to Rome; according to this account, the empress became ill or starved herself to death. The generally unreliable chronicler, John Malalas, wrote that Aurelian humiliated Zenobia by parading her through the eastern cities on a dromedary; in Antioch, the emperor had her chained and seated on a dais in the hippodrome for three days before the city's populace. Malalas concluded his account by writing that Zenobia appeared in Aurelian's triumph and was then beheaded.\nMost ancient historians and modern scholars agree that Zenobia was displayed in Aurelian's 274 triumph; Zosimus was the only source to say that the empress died before reaching Rome, making his account questionable. A public humiliation (as recounted by Malalas) is a plausible scenario, since Aurelian would probably have wanted to publicize his suppression of the Palmyrene rebellion. Only Malalas, however, describes Zenobia's beheading; according to the other historians, her life was spared after Aurelian's triumph. The \"Augustan History\" recorded that Aurelian gave Zenobia a villa in Tibur near Hadrian's Villa, where she lived with her children. Zonaras wrote that Zenobia married a nobleman, and Syncellus wrote that she married a Roman senator. The house she reportedly occupied became a tourist attraction in Rome.\nTitles.\nThe queen owed her elevated position to her son's minority. To celebrate Herodianus' coronation, a statue was erected in Palmyra in 263. According to the inscription on the base of the statue, it was commissioned by Septimius Worod, then the \"duumviri\" (magistrate) of Palmyra, and Julius Aurelius, the Queen's \"procurator\" (treasurer). According to the historian David Potter, Zenobia is the queen mentioned, and the inscription is an evidence for the usage of the title by her during Odaenathus' lifetime. An inscription on a milestone on the road between Palmyra and Emesa, dated to Zenobia's early reign, identifies her as \"illustrious queen, mother of the king of kings\"; this was the first inscription giving her an official position. A lead token from Antioch also identifies Zenobia as queen.\nThe earliest confirmed attestation of Zenobia as queen in Palmyra is an inscription on the base of a statue erected for her by Zabdas and Zabbai, dated to August 271 and calling her \"most illustrious and pious queen\". On an undated milestone found near Byblos, Zenobia is titled \"Sebaste\". The queen was never acknowledged as sole monarch in Palmyra, although she was the \"de facto\" sovereign of the empire; she was always associated with her husband or son in inscriptions, except in Egypt (where some coins were minted in Zenobia's name alone). According to her coins, the queen assumed the title of \"Augusta\" (empress) in 272, and reigned under the regnal name Septimia Zenobia Augusta. In 272, Zenobia, no longer acting as queen-regent, but as Empress of the East, rode forth to beat back the Roman Empire.\nDescendants.\nAside from Vaballathus, it is unclear if Zenobia had other children, and their alleged identities are subject to scholarly disagreements. The image of a child named Hairan (II) appears on a seal impression with that of his brother Vaballathus; no name of a mother was engraved and the seal is undated. Odaenathus' son Herodianus is identified by Udo Hartmann with Hairan I, a son of Odaenathus who appears in Palmyrene inscriptions as early as 251. David S. Potter, on the other hand, suggested that Hairan II is the son of Zenobia and that he is Herodianus instead of Hairan I. Nathanael Andrade maintained that Hairan I, Herodianus, and Hairan II are the same person, rejecting the existence of a second Hairan.\nA controversial Palmyrene inscription mentions the mother of the King Septimius Antiochus; the name of the queen is missing, and Dittenberger refused to fill the gap with Zenobia's name, but many scholars, such as Grace Macurdy considered that the missing name is Zenobia. Septimius Antiochus may have been Vaballathus' younger brother, or was presented in this manner for political reasons; Antiochus was proclaimed emperor in 273, when Palmyra revolted against Rome for a second time. If Antiochus was a son of Zenobia, he was probably a young child not fathered by Odaenathus; Zosimus described him as insignificant, appropriate for a five-year-old boy. On the other hand, Macurdy, citing the language Zosimus used when he described him, considered it more plausible that Antiochus was not a son of Zenobia, but a family relation who used her name to legitimize his claim to the throne.\nThe names of Herennianus and Timolaus were mentioned as children of Zenobia only in the \"Historia Augusta\". Herennianus may be a conflation of Hairan and Herodianus; Timolaus is probably a fabrication, although the historian suggested that he might have been Vaballathus. According to the \"Historia Augusta\", Zenobia's descendants were Roman nobility during the reign of Emperor Valens (reigned 364\u2013375). Eutropius and Jerome chronicled the queen's descendants in Rome during the fourth and fifth centuries. They may have been the result of a reported marriage to a Roman spouse or offspring who accompanied her from Palmyra; both theories, however, are tentative. Zonaras is the only historian to note that Zenobia had daughters; he wrote that one married Aurelian, who married the queen's other daughters to distinguished Romans. According to Southern, the emperor's marriage to Zenobia's daughter is a fabrication. Another descent claim is the relation of saint Zenobius of Florence (337\u2013417) with the queen; the Girolami banking family claimed descent from the fifth century saint, and the alleged relation was first noted in 1286. The family also extended their roots to Zenobia by claiming that the saint was a descendant of her.\nEvaluation and legacy.\nAn evaluation of Zenobia is difficult; the queen was courageous when her husband's supremacy was threatened and by seizing the throne, she protected the region from a power vacuum after Odaenathus' death. According to Watson, she made what Odaenathus left her a \"glittering show of strength\". In the view of Watson, Zenobia should not be seen as a total powermonger, nor as a selfless hero fighting for a cause; according to the historian David Graf, \"She took seriously the titles and responsibilities she assumed for her son and that her program was far more ecumenical and imaginative than that of her husband Odenathus, not just more ambitious\".\nZenobia has inspired scholars, academics, musicians and actors; her fame has lingered in the West, and is supreme in the Middle East. As a heroic queen with a tragic end, she stands alongside Cleopatra and Boudica. The queen's legend turned her into an idol, that can be reinterpreted to accommodate the needs of writers and historians; thus, Zenobia has been by turns a freedom fighter, a hero of the oppressed and a national symbol. The queen is a female role model; according to the historian Michael Rostovtzeff, Catherine the Great liked to compare herself to Zenobia as a woman who created military might and an intellectual court. During the 1930s, thanks to an Egyptian-based feminist press, Zenobia became an icon for women's-magazine readers in the Arabic-speaking world as a strong, nationalistic female leader.\nHer most lasting legacy is in Syria, where the queen is a national symbol. Zenobia became an icon for Syrian nationalists; she had a cult following among Western-educated Syrians, and an 1871 novel by journalist Salim Al Bustani was entitled \"Zenobia malikat Tadmor\" (\"Zenobia, Queen of Palmyra\"). Syrian nationalist Ilyas Matar, who wrote Syria's first history in Arabic in 1874, (\"al-'Uqud al-durriyya fi tarikh al-mamlaka al-Suriyya\"; \"The Pearl Necklace in the History of the Syrian Kingdom\"), was fascinated by Zenobia and included her in his book. To Matar, the queen kindled hope for a new Zenobia who would restore Syria's former grandeur. Another history of Syria was written by Jurji Yanni in 1881, in which Yanni called Zenobia a \"daughter of the fatherland\", and yearned for her \"glorious past\". Yanni described Aurelian as a tyrant who deprived Syria of its happiness and independence by capturing its queen.\nIn modern Syria, Zenobia is regarded as a patriotic symbol; her image appeared on banknotes, and in 1997 she was the subject of the television series Al-Ababeed (\"The Anarchy\"). The series was watched by millions in the Arabic-speaking world. It examined the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict from a Syrian perspective, where the queen's struggle symbolized the Palestinians' struggle to gain the right of self-determination. Zenobia was also the subject of a biography by Mustafa Tlass, Syria's former minister of defense and one of the country's most prominent figures.\nMyth, romanticism and popular culture.\nHarold Mattingly called Zenobia \"one of the most romantic figures in history\". According to Southern, \"The real Zenobia is elusive, perhaps ultimately unattainable, and novelists, playwrights and historians alike can absorb the available evidence, but still need to indulge in varied degrees of speculation.\"\nShe has been the subject of romantic and ideologically-driven biographies by ancient and modern writers. The \"Augustan History\" is the clearest example of an ideological account of Zenobia's life, and its author acknowledged that it was written to criticize the emperor Gallienus. According to the \"Augustan History\", Gallienus was weak because he allowed a woman to rule part of the empire and Zenobia was a more able sovereign than the emperor. The narrative changed as the \"Augustan History\" moved on to the life of Claudius Gothicus, a lauded and victorious emperor, with the author characterizing Zenobia's protection of the eastern frontier as a wise delegation of power by Claudius. When the \"Augustan History\" reached the biography of Aurelian, the author's view of Zenobia changed dramatically; the queen is depicted as a guilty, insolent, proud coward; her wisdom was discredited and her actions deemed the result of manipulation by advisers.\nZenobia's \"staunch\" beauty was emphasized by the author of the \"Augustan History\", who ascribed to her feminine timidity and inconsistency (the reasons for her alleged betrayal of her advisers to save herself). The queen's sex posed a dilemma for the \"Augustan History\" since it cast a shadow on Aurelian's victory. Its author ascribed many masculine traits to Zenobia to make Aurelian a conquering hero who suppressed a dangerous Amazon queen. According to the \"Augustan History\", Zenobia had a clear, manly voice, dressed as an emperor (rather than an empress), rode horseback, was attended by eunuchs instead of ladies-in-waiting, marched with her army, drank with her generals, was careful with money (contrary to the stereotypical spending habits of her sex) and pursued masculine hobbies such as hunting. Giovanni Boccaccio wrote a fanciful 14th-century account of the queen in which she is a tomboy in childhood who preferred wrestling with boys, wandering in the forests and killing goats to playing like a young girl. Zenobia's chastity was a theme of these romanticized accounts; according to the \"Augustan History\", she disdained sexual intercourse and allowed Odaenathus into her bed only for conception. Her reputed chastity impressed some male historians; Edward Gibbon wrote that Zenobia surpassed Cleopatra in chastity and valor. According to Boccaccio, Zenobia safeguarded her virginity when she wrestled with boys as a child.\nSeventeenth-century visitors to Palmyra rekindled the Western world's romantic interest in Zenobia. This interest peaked during the mid-nineteenth century, when Lady Hester Stanhope visited Palmyra and wrote that its people treated her like the queen; she was reportedly greeted with singing and dancing, and Bedouin warriors stood on the city's columns. A procession ended with a mock coronation of Stanhope under the arch of Palmyra as \"queen of the desert\". William Ware, fascinated by Zenobia, wrote a fanciful account of her life. Twentieth-century novelists and playwrights, such as Haley Elizabeth Garwood and Nick Dear, also wrote about the queen.\n* \"Zenobia, Queen of Palmyra\" (1857) by Harriet Hosmer, exhibited at the Art Institute of Chicago.\n* \"Zenobia in Chains\" (1859) by Harriet Hosmer.

{"id": "43384", "revid": "49841801", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43384", "title": "Elizabeth Cady Stanton", "text": "American suffragist (1815\u20131902)\nElizabeth Cady Stanton (n\u00e9e Cady; November 12, 1815 \u2013 October 26, 1902) was an American writer and activist who was a leader of the women's rights movement in the U.S. during the mid- to late-19th century. She was the main force behind the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention, the first convention to be called for the sole purpose of discussing women's rights, and was the primary author of its Declaration of Sentiments. Her demand for women's right to vote generated a controversy at the convention but quickly became a central tenet of the women's movement. She was also active in other social reform activities, especially abolitionism.\nIn 1851, she met Susan B. Anthony and formed a decades-long partnership that was crucial to the development of the women's rights movement. During the American Civil War, they established the Women's Loyal National League to campaign for the abolition of slavery, and they led it in the largest petition drive in U.S. history up to that time. They started a newspaper called \"The Revolution\" in 1868 to work for women's rights.\nAfter the war, Stanton and Anthony were the main organizers of the American Equal Rights Association, which campaigned for equal rights for both African Americans and women, especially the right of suffrage. When the Fifteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was introduced that would provide suffrage for black men only, they opposed it, insisting that suffrage should be extended to all African Americans and all women at the same time. Others in the movement supported the amendment, resulting in a split. During the bitter arguments that led up to the split, Stanton sometimes expressed her ideas in elitist and racially condescending language. In her opposition to the voting rights of African Americans Stanton was quoted to have said, \"It becomes a serious question whether we had better stand aside and let 'Sambo' walk into the kingdom first.\" Frederick Douglass, an abolitionist friend who had escaped from slavery, reproached her for such remarks.\nStanton became the president of the National Woman Suffrage Association, which she and Anthony created to represent their wing of the movement. When the split was healed more than twenty years later, Stanton became the first president of the united organization, the National American Woman Suffrage Association. This was largely an honorary position; Stanton continued to work on a wide range of women's rights issues despite the organization's increasingly tight focus on women's right to vote.\nStanton was the primary author of the first three volumes of the \"History of Woman Suffrage\", a massive effort to record the history of the movement, focusing largely on her wing of it. She was also the primary author of \"The Woman's Bible\", a redaction criticism of the Bible that is based on the premise that its attitude toward women reflects prejudice from a less civilized age.\nChildhood and family background.\nElizabeth Cady was born into the leading family of Johnstown, New York. Their family mansion on the town's main square was handled by as many as twelve servants. Her conservative father, Daniel Cady, was one of the richest landowners in the state. A member of the Federalist Party, he was an attorney who served one term in the U.S. Congress and became a justice in the New York Supreme Court.\nHer mother, Margaret Cady (n\u00e9e Livingston), was more progressive, supporting the radical Garrisonian wing of the abolitionist movement and signing a petition for women's suffrage in 1867. She was described, at least earlier in her life, as \"[n]early six feet tall, strong willed and self-reliant, ... She was the only person in the household not in awe of her husband who was 12 years her senior.\"\nElizabeth was the seventh of eleven children, six of whom died before reaching full adulthood, including all of the boys. Her mother, exhausted by giving birth to so many children and the anguish of seeing so many of them die, became withdrawn and depressed. Tryphena (1804-1891), the oldest daughter, together with her husband Edward Bayard, assumed much of the responsibility for raising Elizabeth and her siblings Eleazor (1806-1826), Harriet (1810-1891), Margaret (1817-1902), and Catherine (1820-1899).\nIn her memoir, \"Eighty Years &amp; More\", Stanton said there were three African-American manservants in her household when she was young. Researchers have determined that one of them, Peter Teabout, was a slave and probably remained so until all enslaved people in New York state were freed on July 4, 1827. Stanton recalled him fondly, saying that she and her sisters attended the Episcopal church with Teabout and sat with him in the back of the church rather than in front with the white families.\nEducation and intellectual development.\nStanton received a better education than most women of her era. She attended Johnstown Academy in her hometown until the age of 15. The only girl in its advanced classes in mathematics and languages, she won second prize in the school's Greek competition and became a skilled debater. She enjoyed her years at the school and said she did not encounter any barriers there due to her gender.\nShe was made sharply aware of society's low expectations for women when Eleazar, her last surviving brother, died at the age of 20 just after graduating from Union College in Schenectady, New York. Her father and mother were incapacitated by grief. The ten-year-old Stanton tried to comfort her father, saying she would try to be all her brother had been. Her father said, \"Oh my daughter, I wish you were a boy!\"\nStanton had many educational opportunities as a young child. Their neighbor, Reverend Simon Hosack, taught her Greek and mathematics. Edward Bayard, her brother-in-law and Eleazar's former classmate at Union College, taught her philosophy and horsemanship. Her father brought her law books to study so she could participate in debates with his law clerks at the dinner table. She wanted to go to college, but no colleges at that time accepted female students. Moreover, her father initially decided she did not need further education. He eventually agreed to enroll her in the Troy Female Seminary in Troy, New York, which was founded and run by Emma Willard.\nIn her memoirs, Stanton said that during her student days in Troy she was greatly disturbed by a six-week religious revival conducted by Charles Grandison Finney, an evangelical preacher and a central figure in the revivalist movement. His preaching, combined with the Calvinistic Presbyterianism of her childhood, terrified her with the possibility of her own damnation: \"Fear of judgment seized my soul. Visions of the lost haunted my dreams. Mental anguish prostrated my health.\"\nStanton credited her father and brother-in-law with convincing her to disregard Finney's warnings. She said they took her on a six-week trip to Niagara Falls during which she read works of rational philosophers who restored her reason and sense of balance. Lori D. Ginzberg, one of Stanton's biographers, says there are problems with this story. For one thing, Finney did not preach for six weeks in Troy while Stanton was there. Ginzberg suspects that Stanton embellished a childhood memory to underline her belief that women harm themselves by falling under the spell of religion.\nMarriage and family.\nAs a young woman, Stanton traveled often to the home of her cousin, Gerrit Smith, who also lived in upstate New York. His views were very different from those of her conservative father. Smith was an abolitionist and a member of the \"Secret Six,\" a group of men who financed John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry in an effort to spark an armed uprising of enslaved African Americans. At Smith's home, where she spent summers and was considered \"part of the family,\" she met Henry Brewster Stanton, a prominent abolitionist agent. Despite her father's reservations, the couple married in 1840, omitting the word \"obey\" from the marriage ceremony. Stanton later wrote, \"I obstinately refused to obey one with whom I supposed I was entering into an equal relation.\"\nWhile uncommon, this practice was not unheard of; Quakers had been omitting \"obey\" from the marriage ceremony for some time.\nStanton took her husband's surname as part of her own, signing herself Elizabeth Cady Stanton or E. Cady Stanton, but not Mrs. Henry B. Stanton.\nSoon after returning from their European honeymoon, the Stantons moved into the Cady household in Johnstown. Henry Stanton studied law under his father-in-law until 1843, when the Stantons moved to Boston (Chelsea), Massachusetts, where Henry joined a law firm. While living in Boston, Elizabeth enjoyed the social, political, and intellectual stimulation that came with a constant round of abolitionist gatherings. Here, she was influenced by such people as Frederick Douglass, William Lloyd Garrison and Ralph Waldo Emerson. In 1847, the Stantons moved to Seneca Falls, New York, in the Finger Lakes region. Their house, which is now a part of the Women's Rights National Historical Park, was purchased for them by Elizabeth's father.\nThe couple had seven children. At that time, child-bearing was considered to be a subject that should be handled with great delicacy. Stanton took a different approach, raising a flag in front of her house after giving birth, a red flag for a boy and a white one for a girl. One of her daughters, Harriot Stanton Blatch, became, like her mother, a leader of the women's suffrage movement. Because of the spacing of their children's births, one historian has concluded that the Stantons must have used birth control methods. Stanton herself said her children were conceived by what she called \"voluntary motherhood.\" In an era when it was commonly held that a wife must submit to her husband's sexual demands, Stanton believed that women should have command over their sexual relationships and childbearing. She also said, however, that \"a healthy woman has as much passion as a man.\" \nStanton encouraged both her sons and daughters to pursue a broad range of interests, activities, and learning. She was remembered by her daughter Margaret as being \"cheerful, sunny and indulgent.\" She enjoyed motherhood and running a large household, but she found herself unsatisfied and even depressed by the lack of intellectual companionship and stimulation in Seneca Falls.\nDuring the 1850s, Henry's work as a lawyer and politician kept him away from home for nearly 10 months out of every year. This frustrated Elizabeth when the children were small because it made it difficult for her to travel. The pattern continued in later years, with husband and wife living apart more often than together, maintaining separate households for several years. Their marriage, which lasted 47 years, ended with Henry Stanton's death in 1887.\nBoth Henry and Elizabeth were staunch abolitionists, but Henry, like Elizabeth's father, disagreed with the idea of female suffrage. One biographer described Henry as, \"at best a halfhearted 'women's rights man.'\"\nEarly activism.\nWorld Anti-Slavery Convention.\nWhile on their honeymoon in England in 1840, the Stantons attended the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London. Elizabeth was appalled by the convention's male delegates, who voted to prevent women from participating even if they had been appointed as delegates of their respective abolitionist societies. The men required the women to sit in a separate section, hidden by curtains from the convention's proceedings. William Lloyd Garrison, a prominent American abolitionist and supporter of women's rights who arrived after the vote had been taken, refused to sit with the men and sat with the women instead.\nLucretia Mott, a Quaker minister, abolitionist and women's rights advocate, was one of the women who had been sent as a delegate. Although Mott was much older than Stanton, they quickly bonded in an enduring friendship, with Stanton eagerly learning from the more experienced activist. While in London, Stanton heard Mott preach in a Unitarian chapel, the first time Stanton had heard a woman give a sermon or even speak in public.\nStanton later gave credit to this convention for focusing her interests on women's rights.\nSeneca Falls Convention.\nAn accumulation of experiences was having an effect on Stanton. The London convention had been a turning point in her life. Her study of law books had convinced her that legal changes were necessary to overcome gender inequities. She had personal experience of the stultifying role of women as wives and housekeepers. She said, \"the wearied, anxious look of the majority of women, impressed me with a strong feeling that some active measures should be taken to remedy the wrongs of society in general, and of women in particular.\" This knowledge, however, did not immediately lead to action. Relatively isolated from other social reformers and fully occupied with household duties, she was at a loss as to how she could engage in social reform.\nIn the summer of 1848, Lucretia Mott traveled from Pennsylvania to attend a Quaker meeting near the Stanton's home. Stanton was invited to visit with Mott and three other progressive Quaker women. Finding herself in sympathetic company, Stanton said she poured out her \"long-accumulating discontent, with such vehemence and indignation that I stirred myself, as well as the rest of the party, to do and dare anything.\" The gathered women agreed to organize a women's rights convention in Seneca Falls a few days later, while Mott was still in the area.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe history of mankind is a history of repeated injuries and usurpation on the part of man toward woman, having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over her\u2026 He has not ever permitted her to exercise her inalienable right to the elective franchise. He has compelled her to submit to laws, in the formation of which she had no voice.\n \"Elizabeth Cady Stanton\", the Declaration of Sentiments of the Seneca Falls Convention\nStanton was the primary author of the convention's Declaration of Rights and Sentiments, which was modeled on the U.S. Declaration of Independence. Its list of grievances included the wrongful denial of women's right to vote, signaling Stanton's intent to generate a discussion of women's suffrage at the convention. This was a highly controversial idea at the time but not an entirely new one. Her cousin Gerrit Smith, no stranger to radical ideas himself, had called for women's suffrage shortly before at the Liberty League convention in Buffalo. When Henry Stanton saw the inclusion of women's suffrage in the document, he told his wife that she was acting in a way that would turn the proceedings into a farce. Lucretia Mott, the main speaker, was also disturbed by the proposal.\nAn estimated 300 women and men attended the two-day Seneca Falls Convention. In her first address to a large audience, Stanton explained the purpose of the gathering and the importance of women's rights. Following a speech by Mott, Stanton read the Declaration of Sentiments, which the attendees were invited to sign. Next came the resolutions, all of which the convention adopted unanimously except for the ninth, which read, \"it is the duty of the women of this country to secure to themselves the sacred right of the elective franchise.\" Following a vigorous debate, this resolution was adopted only after Frederick Douglass, an abolitionist leader who had formerly been enslaved, gave it his strong support.\nStanton's sister Harriet attended the convention and signed its Declaration of Sentiments. Her husband, however, made her remove her signature.\nAlthough this was a local convention organized on short notice, its controversial nature ensured that it was widely noted in the press, with articles appearing in newspapers in New York City, Philadelphia and many other places. The Seneca Falls Convention is now recognized as an historic event, the first convention to be called for the purpose of discussing women's rights. The convention's Declaration of Sentiments became \"the single most important factor in spreading news of the women's rights movement around the country in 1848 and into the future,\" according to Judith Wellman, a historian of the convention. The convention initiated the use of women's rights conventions as organizing tools for the early women's movement. By the time of the second National Women's Rights Convention in 1851, the demand for women's right to vote had become a central tenet of the United States women's rights movement.\nA Rochester Women's Rights Convention was held in Rochester, New York two weeks later, organized by local women who had attended the one in Seneca Falls. Both Stanton and Mott spoke at this convention. The convention in Seneca Falls had been chaired by James Mott, the husband of Lucretia Mott. The Rochester convention was chaired by a woman, Abigail Bush, another historic first. Many people were disturbed by the idea of a woman chairing a convention of both men and women. How, for example, might people react if a woman ruled a man out of order? Stanton herself spoke in opposition to the election of a woman as the chair of this convention, although she later acknowledged her mistake and apologized for her action.\nWhen the first National Women's Rights Convention was organized in 1850, Stanton was unable to attend because she was pregnant. Instead, she sent a letter to the convention entitled \"Should women hold office\" that outlined the movement's goals. The letter emphatically endorsed women's right to hold office, stating that \"women might have a 'purifying, elevating, softening influence' on the 'political experiment of our Republic.'\u201d Thereafter it became a tradition to open national women's rights conventions with a letter by Stanton, who did not participate in person in a national convention until 1860.\nPartnership with Susan B. Anthony.\nWhile visiting Seneca Falls in 1851, Susan B. Anthony was introduced to Stanton by Amelia Bloomer, a mutual friend and a supporter of women's rights. Anthony, who was five years younger than Stanton, came from a Quaker family that was active in reform movements. Anthony and Stanton soon became close friends and co-workers, forming a relationship that was a turning point in their lives and of great importance to the women's movement.\nThe two women had complementary skills. Anthony excelled at organizing, while Stanton had an aptitude for intellectual matters and writing. Stanton later said, \"In writing we did better work together than either could alone. While she is slow and analytical in composition, I am rapid and synthetic. I am the better writer, she the better critic.\" Anthony deferred to Stanton in many ways throughout their years of work together, not accepting an office in any organization that would place her above Stanton. In their letters, they referred to one another as \"Susan\" and \"Mrs. Stanton.\"\nBecause Stanton was homebound with seven children while Anthony was unmarried and free to travel, Anthony assisted Stanton by supervising her children while Stanton wrote.\nAmong other things, this allowed Stanton to write speeches for Anthony to give.\nOne of Anthony's biographers said, \"Susan became one of the family and was almost another mother to Mrs. Stanton's children.\" One of Stanton's biographers said, \"Stanton provided the ideas, rhetoric, and strategy; Anthony delivered the speeches, circulated petitions, and rented the halls. Anthony prodded and Stanton produced.\" Stanton's husband said, \"Susan stirred the puddings, Elizabeth stirred up Susan, and then Susan stirs up the world!\" Stanton herself said, \"I forged the thunderbolts, she fired them.\"\nBy 1854, Anthony and Stanton \"had perfected a collaboration that made the New York State movement the most sophisticated in the country,\" according to Ann D. Gordon, a professor of women's history.\nAfter the Stantons moved from Seneca Falls to New York City in 1861, a room was set aside for Anthony in every house they lived in. One of Stanton's biographers estimated that, over her lifetime, Stanton spent more time with Anthony than with any other adult, including her own husband.\nIn December 1865, Stanton and Anthony submitted the first women's suffrage petition directed to Congress during the drafting of the Fourteenth Amendment. The women challenged the use of the word \"male\" in the version submitted to the States for ratification. When Congress failed to remove the language, Stanton announced her candidacy as the first woman to run for Congress in October 1866. She ran as an independent and secured only 24 votes, but her candidacy sparked conversations surrounding women's officeholding separate from suffrage.\nIn December 1872, Stanton and Anthony each wrote New Departure memorials to Congress and were invited to read their memorials to the Senate Judiciary Committee. This further brought women's suffrage and officeholding to the forefront of Congress's agenda, even though the New Departure agenda was ultimately rejected.\nThe relationship was not without its strains, especially as Anthony could not match Stanton's charm and charisma. In 1871, Anthony said, \"whoever goes into a parlor or before an audience with that woman does it at the cost of a fearful overshadowing, a price which I have paid for the last ten years, and that cheerfully, because I felt that our cause was most profited by her being seen and heard, and my best work was making the way clear for her.\"\nTemperance activity.\nExcessive consumption of alcohol was a severe social problem during this period, one that began to diminish only in the 1850s. Many activists considered temperance to be a women's rights issue because of laws that gave husbands complete control of the family and its finances. The law provided almost no recourse to a woman with a drunken husband, even if his condition left the family destitute and he was abusive to her and their children. If she managed to obtain a divorce, which was difficult to do, he could easily end up with sole guardianship of their children.\nIn 1852, Anthony was elected as a delegate to the New York state temperance convention. When she tried to participate in the discussion, the chairman stopped her, saying that women delegates were there only to listen and learn. Years later, Anthony observed, \"No advanced step taken by women has been so bitterly contested as that of speaking in public. For nothing which they have attempted, not even to secure the suffrage, have they been so abused, condemned and antagonized.\" Anthony and other women walked out and announced their intention to organize a women's temperance convention. Later that year, about five hundred women met in Rochester and created the Women's State Temperance Society, with Stanton as president and Anthony as state agent. This leadership arrangement, with Stanton in the public role as president and Anthony as the energetic force behind the scenes, was characteristic of the organizations they founded in later years.\nIn her first public speech since 1848, Stanton delivered the convention's keynote address, one that antagonized religious conservatives. She called for drunkenness to be legal grounds for divorce at a time when many conservatives opposed divorce for any reason. She appealed for wives of drunkard husbands to take control of their marital relations, saying, \"Let no woman remain in relation of wife with the confirmed drunkard. Let no drunkard be the father of her children.\" She attacked the religious establishment, calling for women to donate their money to the poor instead of to the \"education of young men for the ministry, for the building up a theological aristocracy and gorgeous temples to the unknown God.\"\nAt the organization's convention the following year, conservatives voted Stanton out as president, whereupon she and Anthony resigned from the organization. Temperance was not a significant reform activity for Stanton afterwards, although she continued to use local temperance societies in the early 1850s as conduits for advocating women's rights. She regularly wrote articles for \"The Lily\", a monthly temperance newspaper that she helped transform into one that reported news of the women's rights movement. She also wrote for The Una, a women's rights periodical edited by Paulina Wright Davis, and for the New York Tribune, a daily newspaper edited by Horace Greeley.\nMarried Women's Property Act.\nThe status of married women at that time was in part set by English common law which for centuries had set the doctrine of coverture in local courts. It held wives were under the protection and control of their husbands. In the words of William Blackstone's 1769 book \"Commentaries on the Laws of England\": \"By marriage, the husband and wife are one person in law: that is, the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage.\" The husband of a married woman became the owner of any property she brought into a marriage. She could not sign contracts, operate a business in her own name, or retain custody of their children in the event of a divorce. In practice some American courts followed the common law. Some Southern states like Texas and Florida provided more equality for women. Across the country state legislatures were taking control away from common law traditions by passing legislation.\nIn 1836, the New York legislature began considering a Married Women's Property Act, with women's rights advocate Ernestine Rose an early supporter who circulated petitions in its favor. Stanton's father supported this reform. Having no sons to pass his considerable wealth to, he was faced with the prospect of having it eventually pass to the control of his daughters' husbands. Stanton circulated petitions and lobbied legislators in favor of the proposed law as early as 1843.\nThe law eventually passed in 1848. It allowed a married woman to retain the property that she possessed before the marriage or acquired during the marriage, and it protected her property from her husband's creditors. Enacted shortly before the Seneca Falls Convention, it strengthened the women's rights movement by increasing the ability of women to act independently. By weakening the traditional belief that husbands spoke for their wives, it assisted many of the reforms that Stanton championed, such as the right of women to speak in public and to vote.\nIn 1853, Susan B. Anthony organized a petition campaign in New York state for an improved property rights law for married women.\nAs part of the presentation of these petitions to the legislature, Stanton spoke in 1854 to a joint session of the Judiciary Committee, arguing that voting rights were needed to enable women to protect their newly won property rights. In 1860, Stanton spoke again to the Judiciary Committee, this time before a large audience in the assembly chamber, arguing that women's suffrage was the only real protection for married women, their children and their material assets. She pointed to similarities in the legal status of woman and slaves, saying, \"The prejudice against color, of which we hear so much, is no stronger than that against sex. It is produced by the same cause, and manifested very much in the same way. The negro's skin and the woman's sex are both prima facie evidence that they were intended to be in subjection to the white Saxon man.\" The legislature passed the improved law in 1860.\nDress reform.\nIn 1851, Elizabeth Smith Miller, Stanton's cousin, brought a new style of dress to the upstate New York area. Unlike traditional floor-length dresses, it consisted of pantaloons worn under a knee-length dress. Amelia Bloomer, Stanton's friend and neighbor, publicized the attire in \"The Lily\", a monthly magazine that she published. Thereafter it was popularly known as the \"Bloomer\" dress, or just \"Bloomers.\" It was soon adopted by many female reform activists despite harsh ridicule from traditionalists, who considered the idea of women wearing any sort of trousers as a threat to the social order. To Stanton, it solved the problem of climbing stairs with a baby in one hand, a candle in the other, and somehow also lifting the skirt of a long dress to avoid tripping. Stanton wore \"Bloomers\" for two years, abandoning the attire only after it became clear that the controversy it created was distracting people from the campaign for women's rights. Other women's rights activists eventually did the same.\nDivorce reform.\nStanton had already antagonized traditionalists in 1852 at the women's temperance convention by advocating a woman's right to divorce a drunken husband. In an hour-long speech at the Tenth National Women's Rights Convention in 1860, she went further, generating a heated debate that took up an entire session. She cited tragic examples of unhealthy marriages, suggesting that some marriages amounted to \"legalized prostitution.\" She challenged both the sentimental and the religious views of marriage, defining marriage as a civil contract subject to the same restrictions of any other contract. If a marriage did not produce the expected happiness, she said, then it would be a duty to end it. Strong opposition to her speech was voiced in the ensuing discussion. Abolitionist leader Wendell Phillips, arguing that divorce was not a women's rights issue because it affected both women and men equally, said the subject was out of order and tried unsuccessfully to have it removed from the record.\nIn later years on the lecture circuit, Stanton's speech on divorce was one of her most popular, drawing audiences of up to 1200 people. In an 1890 essay entitled \"Divorce versus Domestic Warfare,\" Stanton opposed calls by some women activists for stricter divorce laws, saying, \"The rapidly increasing number of divorces, far from showing a lower state of morals, proves exactly the reverse. Woman is in a transition period from slavery to freedom, and she will not accept the conditions and married life that she has heretofore meekly endured.\"\nAbolitionist activity.\nIn 1860 Stanton published a pamphlet called \"The Slaves Appeal\" written from what she imagined to be the viewpoint of a female slave. The fictional speaker uses vivid religious language (\"Men and women of New York, the God of thunder speaks through you\") that expresses religious views very different from those that Stanton herself held. The speaker describes the horrors of slavery, saying, \"The trembling girl for whom thou didst pay a price but yesterday in a New Orleans market, is not thy lawful wife. Foul and damning, both to the master and the slave, is this wholesale violation of the immutable laws of God.\" The pamphlet called for defiance of the Federal Fugitive Slave Act, and it included petitions to be used for opposing the practice of hunting escaped slaves.\nIn 1861, Anthony organized a tour of abolitionist lecturers in upstate New York that included Stanton and several other speakers. The tour began in January just after South Carolina had seceded from the union but before other states had seceded and before the outbreak of war. In her speech, Stanton said that South Carolina was like a willful son whose behavior jeopardized the whole family and that the best course of action was to let it secede. The lecture meetings were repeatedly disrupted by mobs operating under the belief that abolitionist activity was causing southern states to secede. Stanton was not able to participate in some of the lectures because she had to return home to her children. At her husband's urging, she left the lecture tour because of the persistent threat of violence.\nWomen's Loyal National League.\nIn 1863, Anthony moved into the Stantons' house in New York City and the two women began organizing the Women's Loyal National League to campaign for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would abolish slavery. Stanton became president of the new organization and Anthony was secretary.\nIt was the first national women's political organization in the United States. In the largest petition drive in the nation's history up to that time, the League collected nearly 400,000 signatures to abolish slavery, representing approximately one out of every twenty-four adults in the Northern states.\nThe petition drive significantly assisted the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment, which ended slavery.\nThe League disbanded in 1864 after it became clear that the amendment would be approved.\nAlthough its purpose was the abolition of slavery, the League made it clear that it also stood for political equality for women, approving a resolution at its founding convention that called for equal rights for all citizens regardless of race or sex. The League indirectly advanced the cause of women's rights in several ways. Stanton pointedly reminded the public that petitioning was the only political tool available to women at a time when only men were allowed to vote. The success of the League's petition drive demonstrated the value of formal organization to the women's movement, which had traditionally resisted being anything other than loosely organized up to that point. Its 5000 members constituted a widespread network of women activists who gained experience that helped create a pool of talent for future forms of social activism, including suffrage. Stanton and Anthony emerged from this endeavor with significant national reputations.\nAmerican Equal Rights Association.\nAfter the Civil War, Stanton and Anthony became alarmed at reports that the proposed Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which would provide citizenship for African Americans, would also for the first time introduce the word \"male\" into the constitution. Stanton said, \"if that word 'male' be inserted, it will take us a century at least to get it out.\"\nOrganizing opposition to this development required preparation because the women's movement had become largely inactive during the Civil War. In January 1866, Stanton and Anthony sent out petitions calling for a constitutional amendment providing for women's suffrage, with Stanton's name at the top of the list of signatures. Stanton and Anthony organized the Eleventh National Women's Rights Convention in May 1866, the first since the Civil War began. The convention voted to transform itself into the American Equal Rights Association (AERA), whose purpose was to campaign for the equal rights of all citizens regardless of race or sex, especially the right of suffrage. Stanton was offered the post of president but declined in a favor of Lucretia Mott. Other officers included Stanton as first vice president, Anthony as a corresponding secretary, Frederick Douglass as a vice president, and Lucy Stone as a member of the executive committee. Stanton provided hospitality for some of the attendees at this convention. Sojourner Truth, an abolitionist and women's rights activist who had formerly been enslaved, stayed at Stanton's house as, of course, did Anthony.\nLeading abolitionists opposed the AERA's drive for universal suffrage. Horace Greeley, a prominent newspaper editor, told Anthony and Stanton, \"This is a critical period for the Republican Party and the life of our Nation... I conjure you to remember that this is 'the negro's hour.'\" Abolitionist leaders Wendell Phillips and Theodore Tilton arranged a meeting with Stanton and Anthony, trying to convince them that the time had not yet come for women's suffrage, that they should campaign for voting rights for black men only, not for all African Americans and all women. The two women rejected this guidance and continued to work for universal suffrage.\nIn 1866, Stanton declared herself a candidate for Congress, the first woman to do so. She said that although she could not vote, there was nothing in the Constitution to prevent her from running for Congress. Running as an independent against both the Democrat and Republican candidates, she received only 24 votes. Her campaign was noted by newspapers as far away as New Orleans.\nIn 1867, the AERA campaigned in Kansas for referendums that would enfranchise both African Americans and women. Wendell Phillips, who opposed mixing those two causes, blocked the funding that the AERA had expected for their campaign.\nBy the end of summer, the AERA campaign had almost collapsed, and its finances were exhausted. Anthony and Stanton created a storm of controversy by accepting help during the last days of the campaign from George Francis Train, a wealthy businessman who supported women's rights. Train antagonized many activists by attacking the Republican Party and openly disparaging the integrity and intelligence of African Americans.\nThere is reason to believe that Stanton and Anthony hoped to draw the volatile Train away from his cruder forms of racism, and that he had actually begun to do so. In any case, Stanton said she would accept support from the devil himself if he supported women's suffrage.\nAfter the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, a sharp dispute erupted within the AERA over the proposed Fifteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which would prohibit the denial of suffrage because of race. Stanton and Anthony opposed the amendment, which would have the effect of enfranchising black men, insisting that all women and all African Americans should be enfranchised at the same time. Stanton argued in the pages of \"The Revolution\" that by effectively enfranchising all men while excluding all women, the amendment would create an \"aristocracy of sex,\" giving constitutional authority to the idea that men were superior to women.\nLucy Stone, who was emerging as a leader of those who were opposed to Stanton and Anthony, argued that suffrage for women would be more beneficial to the country than suffrage for black men but supported the amendment, saying, \"I will be thankful in my soul if \"any\" body can get out of the terrible pit.\"\nDuring the debate over the Fifteenth Amendment, Stanton wrote articles for \"The Revolution\" with language that was elitist and racially condescending. She believed that a long process of education would be needed before many of the former slaves and immigrant workers would be able to participate meaningfully as voters. Stanton wrote, \"American women of wealth, education, virtue and refinement, if you do not wish the lower orders of Chinese, Africans, Germans and Irish, with their low ideas of womanhood to make laws for you and your daughters ... demand that women too shall be represented in government.\" In another article, Stanton objected to laws being made for women by \"Patrick and Sambo and Hans and Yung Tung who do not know the difference between a Monarchy and a Republic.\" She also used the term \"Sambo\" on other occasions, drawing a rebuke from her old friend Frederick Douglass.\nDouglass strongly supported women's suffrage but said that suffrage for African Americans was a more urgent issue, literally a matter of life and death. He said that white women already exerted a positive influence on government through the voting power of their husbands, fathers and brothers, and that it \"does not seem generous\" for Anthony and Stanton to insist that black men should not achieve suffrage unless women achieved it at the same time. Sojourner Truth, on the other hand, supported Stanton's position, saying, \"if colored men get their rights, and not colored women theirs, you see the colored men will be masters over the women, and it will be just as bad as it was before.\"\nEarly in 1869, Stanton called for a Sixteenth Amendment that would provide suffrage for women, saying, \"The male element is a destructive force, stern, selfish, aggrandizing, loving war, violence, conquest, acquisition \u2026 in the dethronement of woman we have let loose the elements of violence and ruin that she only has the power to curb.\"\nThe AERA increasingly divided into two wings, each advocating universal suffrage but with different approaches. One wing, whose leading figure was Lucy Stone, was willing for black men to achieve suffrage first and wanted to maintain close ties with the Republican Party and the abolitionist movement. The other, whose leading figures were Stanton and Anthony, insisted that all women and all African Americans should be enfranchised at the same time and worked toward a women's movement that would no longer be tied to the Republican Party or be financially dependent on abolitionists. The AERA effectively dissolved after an acrimonious meeting in May 1869, and two competing woman suffrage organizations were created in its aftermath. In the words of one of Stanton's biographers, one consequence of the split for Stanton was that, \"Old friends became either enemies, like Lucy Stone, or wary associates, as in the case of Frederick Douglass.\"\n\"The Revolution\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe establishing of woman on her rightful throne is the greatest revolution the world has ever known or ever will know\"\n\u2014\"Elizabeth Cady Stanton\"\nIn 1868, Anthony and Stanton began publishing a sixteen-page weekly newspaper called \"The Revolution\" in New York City. Stanton was co-editor along with Parker Pillsbury, an experienced editor who was an abolitionist and a supporter of women's rights. Anthony, the owner, managed the business aspects of the paper. Initial funding was provided by George Francis Train, the controversial businessman who supported women's rights but who alienated many activists with his political and racial views. The newspaper focused primarily on women's rights, especially suffrage for women, but it also covered topics such as politics, the labor movement and finance. One of its stated goals was to provide a forum in which women could exchange opinions on key issues. Its motto was \"Men, their rights and nothing more: women, their rights and nothing less.\"\nSisters Harriet Beecher Stowe and Isabella Beecher Hooker offered to provide funding for the newspaper if its name was changed to something less inflammatory, but Stanton declined their offer, strongly favoring its existing name.\nTheir goal was to grow \"The Revolution\" into a daily paper with its own printing press, all owned and operated by women. The funding that Train had arranged for the newspaper, however, was less than expected. Moreover, Train sailed for England after \"The Revolution\" published its first issue and was soon jailed for supporting Irish independence. Train's financial support eventually disappeared entirely. After twenty-nine months, mounting debts forced the transfer of the paper to a wealthy women's rights activist who gave it a less radical tone. Despite the relatively short time it was in their hands, \"The Revolution\" gave Stanton and Anthony a means for expressing their views during the developing split within the women's movement. It also helped them promote their wing of the movement, which eventually became a separate organization.\nStanton refused to take responsibility for the $10,000 debt the newspaper had accumulated, saying she had children to support. Anthony, who had less money than Stanton, took responsibility for the debt, repaying it over a six-year period through paid speaking tours.\nNational Woman Suffrage Association.\nIn May 1869, two days after the final AERA convention, Stanton, Anthony and others formed the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA), with Stanton as president. Six months later, Lucy Stone, Julia Ward Howe and others formed the rival American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA), which was larger and better funded. The immediate cause for the split in the women's suffrage movement was the proposed Fifteenth Amendment, but the two organizations had other differences as well. The NWSA was politically independent while the AWSA aimed for close ties with the Republican Party, hoping that ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment would lead to Republican support for women's suffrage. The NWSA focused primarily on winning suffrage at the national level while the AWSA pursued a state-by-state strategy. The NWSA initially worked on a wider range of women's issues than the AWSA, including divorce reform and equal pay for women.\nAs the new organization was being formed, Stanton proposed to limit its membership to women, but her proposal was not accepted. In practice, however, the overwhelming majority of its members and officers were women.\nStanton disliked many aspects of organizational work because it interfered with her ability to study, think, and write. She begged Anthony, without success, to arrange the NWSA's first convention so that she herself would not need to attend. For the rest of her life, Stanton attended conventions only reluctantly if at all, wanting to maintain the freedom to express her opinions without worrying about who in the organization might be offended.\nOf the fifteen NWSA meetings between 1870 and 1879, Stanton presided at four and was present at only one other, leaving Anthony effectively in charge of the organization.\nIn 1869 Francis and Virginia Minor, husband and wife suffragists from Missouri, developed a strategy based on the idea that the U.S. Constitution implicitly enfranchised women. It relied heavily on the Fourteenth Amendment, which says, \"No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States \u2026 nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" In 1871 the NWSA officially adopted what had become known as the New Departure strategy, encouraging women to attempt to vote and to file lawsuits if denied that right. Soon hundreds of women tried to vote in dozens of localities. Susan B. Anthony actually succeeded in voting in 1872, for which she was arrested and found guilty in a widely publicized trial. In 1880, Stanton also tried to vote. When the election officials refused to let her place her ballot in the box, she threw it at them. When the Supreme Court ruled in 1875 in \"Minor v. Happersett\" that \"the Constitution of the United States does not confer the right of suffrage upon anyone,\" the NWSA decided to pursue the far more difficult strategy of campaigning for a constitutional amendment that would guarantee voting rights for women.\nIn 1878, Stanton and Anthony convinced Senator Aaron A. Sargent to introduce into Congress a women's suffrage amendment that, more than forty years later, would be ratified as the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Its text is identical to that of the Fifteenth Amendment except that it prohibits the denial of suffrage because of sex rather than \"race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\"\nStanton traveled with her daughter Harriet to Europe in May 1882 and did not return for a year and a half. Already a public figure of some prominence in Europe, she gave several speeches there and wrote reports for American newspapers. She visited her son Theodore in France, where she met her first grandchild, and traveled to England for Harriet's marriage to an Englishman. After Anthony joined her in England in March 1883, they traveled together to meet with leaders of European women's movements, laying the groundwork for an international women's organization. Stanton and Anthony returned to the U.S. together in November 1883. Hosted by the NWSA, delegates from fifty-three women's organizations in nine countries met in Washington in 1888 to form the organization that Stanton and Anthony had been working toward, the International Council of Women (ICW), which is still active.\nStanton traveled again to Europe in October 1886, visiting her children in France and England. She returned to the U.S. in March 1888 barely in time to deliver a major speech at the founding meeting of the ICW. When Anthony discovered that Stanton had not yet written her speech, she insisted that Stanton stay in her hotel room until she had written it, and she placed a younger colleague outside her door to make sure she did so.\nStanton later teased Anthony, saying, \"Well, as all women are supposed to be under the thumb of some man, I prefer a tyrant of my own sex, so I shall not deny the patent fact of my subjection.\"\nThe convention succeeded in bringing increased publicity and respectability to the women's movement, especially when President Grover Cleveland honored the delegates by inviting them to a reception at the White House.\nDespite her record of racially insensitive remarks and occasional appeals to the racial prejudices of white people, Stanton applauded the marriage in 1884 of her friend Frederick Douglass to Helen Pitts, a white woman, a marriage that enraged racists. Stanton wrote Douglass a warm letter of congratulation, to which Douglass responded that he had been sure that she would be happy for him. When Anthony realized that Stanton was planning to publish her letter, she convinced her not to do so, wanting to avoid associating women's suffrage with an unrelated and divisive issue.\n\"History of Woman Suffrage\".\nIn 1876, Anthony moved into Stanton's house in New Jersey to begin working with Stanton on the \"History of Woman Suffrage\". She brought with her several trunks and boxes of letters, newspaper clippings, and other documents. Originally envisioned as a modest publication that could be produced quickly, the history evolved into a six-volume work of more than 5700 pages written over a period of 41 years.\nThe first three volumes, which cover the movement up to 1885, were produced by Stanton, Anthony and Matilda Joslyn Gage. Anthony handled the production details and the correspondence with contributors. Stanton wrote most of the first three volumes, with Gage writing three chapters of the first volume and Stanton writing the rest. Gage was forced to abandon the project afterwards because of the illness of her husband. After Stanton's death, Anthony published Volume 4 with the help of Ida Husted Harper. After Anthony's death, Harper completed the last two volumes, which brought the history up to 1920.\nStanton and Anthony encouraged their rival Lucy Stone to assist with the work, or at least to send material that could be used by someone else to write the history of her wing of the movement, but she refused to cooperate in any way. Stanton's daughter Harriot Stanton Blatch, who had returned from Europe to assist with the editing, insisted that the history would not be taken seriously if Stone and the AWSA were not included. She herself wrote a 120-page chapter on Stone and the AWSA, which appears in Volume 2.\nThe \"History of Woman Suffrage\" preserves an enormous amount of material that might have been lost forever. Written by leaders of one wing of the divided women's movement it does not, however, give a balanced view of events where their rivals are concerned. It overstates the role of Stanton and Anthony, and it understates or ignores the roles of Stone and other activists who did not fit into the historical narrative they had developed. Because it was for years the main source of documentation about the suffrage movement, historians have had to uncover other sources to provide a more balanced view.\nLecture circuit.\nStanton worked as a lecturer for the New York bureau of the Redpath Lyceum from late 1869 until 1879. This organization was part of the Lyceum movement, which arranged for speakers and entertainers to tour the country, often visiting small communities where educational opportunities and theaters were scarce. For ten years, Stanton traveled eight months of the year on the lecture circuit, usually delivering one lecture per day, two on Sundays. She also arranged smaller meetings with local women who were interested in women's rights. Traveling was sometimes difficult. One year, when deep snow closed the railroads, Stanton hired a sleigh and kept going, bundled in furs to protect against freezing weather.\nDuring 1871, she and Anthony traveled together for three months through several western states, eventually arriving in California.\nHer most popular lecture, \"Our Girls,\" urged young women to be independent and to seek self-fulfillment. In \"The Antagonism of Sex,\" she addressed the question of women's rights with a special fervor. Other popular lectures were \"Our Boys,\" \"Co-education,\" \"Marriage and Divorce\" and \"The Subjugation of Women.\" On Sundays she would often speak on \"Famous Women in the Bible\" and \"The Bible and Women's Rights.\"\nHer earnings were impressive. During her first three months on the road, Stanton reported, she cleared \"$2000 above all expenses \u2026 besides stirring women generally up to rebellion.\" Accounting for inflation, that would be about $ in today's dollars. Because her husband's income had always been erratic and he had invested it badly, the money she earned was welcome, especially with most of their children either in college or soon to begin.\nFamily events.\nAfter 15 years in Seneca Falls, Stanton moved to New York City in 1862 when her husband secured the position of deputy collector for the Port of New York. Their son Neil, who worked for Henry as his clerk, was caught taking bribes, causing both father and son to lose their jobs. Henry worked intermittently afterward as a journalist and a lawyer.\nWhen her father died in 1859, Stanton received an inheritance worth an estimated $50,000, or about $ in today's dollars. In 1868, she bought a substantial country house near Tenafly, New Jersey, an hour's ride by train from New York City. The Stanton house in Tenafly is now a National Historic Landmark. Henry remained in the city in a rented apartment. Aside from visits, she and Henry afterward mostly lived apart.\nSix of the seven Stanton children graduated from college. Colleges were closed to women when Stanton sought higher education, but both of her daughters were educated at Vassar College. Because graduate studies were not yet available to women in the U.S., Harriet enrolled in a master's program in France, which she abandoned after she became engaged to be married. Harriet earned a master's degree from Vassar at the age of 35.\nAfter 1884, Henry began to spend more time at Tenafly. In 1885, just before his 80th birthday, he published a short autobiography called \"Random Recollections\". In it, he said that he had married the daughter of the famous Judge Cady, but he did not provide her name. In the third edition of his book, he mentioned his wife by name a single time. He died in 1887 while she was in England visiting their daughter.\nNational American Woman Suffrage Association.\nThe Fifteenth Amendment was ratified in 1870, removing much of the original reason for the split in the women's suffrage movement. As early as 1875, Anthony began urging the NWSA to focus more tightly on women's suffrage instead of a variety of women's issues, which brought it closer to the AWSA's approach. The rivalry between the two organizations remained bitter, however, as the AWSA began to decline in strength during the 1880s.\nIn the late 1880s, Alice Stone Blackwell, daughter of AWSA leader Lucy Stone, began working to heal the breach among the older generation of leaders. Anthony warily cooperated with this effort, but Stanton did not, disappointed that both organizations wanted to focus almost exclusively on suffrage. She wrote to a friend: \"Lucy &amp; Susan alike see suffrage only. They do not see women's religious &amp; social bondage, neither do the young women in either association, hence they may as well combine.\"\nIn 1890, the two organizations merged as the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). At Anthony's insistence, Stanton accepted its presidency despite her unease at the direction of the new organization. In her speech at the founding convention, she urged it to work on a broad range of women's issues and called for it to include all races, creeds and classes, including \"Mormon, Indian and black women.\"\nThe day after she was elected president, Stanton sailed to her daughter's home in England, where she stayed for eighteen months, leaving Anthony effectively in charge. When Stanton declined reelection to the presidency at the 1892 convention, Anthony was elected to that post.\nIn 1892, Stanton delivered the speech that became known as \"The Solitude of Self\" three different times in as many days, twice to Congressional committees and once as her final address to the NAWSA.\nShe considered it her best speech, and many others agreed. Lucy Stone printed it in its entirety in the \"Woman's Journal\" in the space where her own speech normally would have appeared. In pursuit of her lifelong quest to overturn the belief that women were lesser beings than men and therefore not suited for independence, Stanton said in this speech that women must develop themselves, acquiring an education and nourishing an inner strength, a belief in themselves. Self-sovereignty was the essential element in a woman's life, not her role as daughter, wife or mother. Stanton said, \"no matter how much women prefer to lean, to be protected and supported, nor how much men desire to have them do so, they must make the voyage of life alone.\"\n\"The Woman's Bible\" and views on religion.\nStanton said she had been terrified as a child by a minister's talk of damnation, but, after overcoming those fears with the help of her father and brother-in-law, had rejected that type of religion entirely. As an adult, her religious views continued to evolve. While living in Boston in the 1840s, she was attracted to the preaching of Theodore Parker, who, like her cousin Gerritt Smith, was a member of the Secret Six, a group of men who financed John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry in an effort to spark an armed slave rebellion. Parker was a transcendentalist and a prominent Unitarian minister who taught that the Bible need not be taken literally, that God need not be envisioned as a male, and that individual men and women had the ability to determine religious truth for themselves.\nIn the Declaration of Sentiments written for the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention, Stanton listed a series of grievances against males who, among other things, excluded women from the ministry and other leading roles in religion. In one of those grievances, Stanton said that man \"has usurped the prerogative of Jehovah himself, claiming it as his right to assign for her a sphere of action, when that belongs to her conscience and her God.\" This was the only grievance that was not a matter of fact (such as exclusion of women from colleges, from the right to vote, etc.), but one of belief, one that challenged a fundamental basis of authority and autonomy.\nThe years after the Civil War saw a significant increase in the variety of women's social reform organizations and the number of activists in them. Stanton was uneasy about the belief held by many of these activists that government should enforce Christian ethics through such actions as teaching the Bible in public schools and strengthening Sunday closing laws. In her speech at the 1890 unity convention that established the NAWSA, Stanton said, \"I hope this convention will declare that the Woman Suffrage Association is opposed to all Union of Church and State and pledges itself \u2026 to maintain the secular nature of our government.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDo all you can, \"no matter what\", to get people to think on your reform, and then, if the reform is good, it will come about in due season.\n\"Elizabeth Cady Stanton\", diary entry in 1898\nIn 1895, Stanton published \"The Woman's Bible\", a provocative examination of the Bible that questioned its status as the word of God and attacked the way it was being used to relegate women to an inferior status. Stanton wrote most of it, with the assistance of several other women, including Matilda Joslyn Gage, who had assisted with the History of Woman Suffrage. In it, Stanton methodically worked her way through the Bible, quoting selected passages and commenting on them, often sarcastically. A best-seller, with seven printings in six months, it was translated into several languages. A second volume was published in 1898.\nThe book created a storm of controversy that affected the entire women's rights movement. Stanton could not have been surprised, having earlier told an acquaintance, \"Well, if we who do see the absurdities of the old superstitions never unveil them to others, how is the world to make any progress in the theologies? I am in the sunset of life, and I feel it to be my special mission to tell people what they are not prepared to hear.\"\nThe process of critically examining the text of the Bible, known as historical criticism, was already an established practice in scholarly circles. What Stanton did that was new was to scrutinize the Bible from a woman's point of view, basing her findings on the proposition that much of its text reflected not the word of God but prejudice against women during a less civilized age.\nIn her book, Stanton explicitly denied much of what was central to traditional Christianity, saying, \"I do not believe that any man ever saw or talked with God, I do not believe that God inspired the Mosaic code, or told the historians what they say he did about woman, for all the religions on the face of the earth degrade her, and so long as woman accepts the position that they assign her, her emancipation is impossible.\" In the book's closing words, Stanton expressed the hope for reconstructing \"a more rational religion for the nineteenth century, and thus escape all the perplexities of the Jewish mythology as of no more importance than those of the Greek, Persian, and Egyptian.\"\nAt the 1896 NAWSA convention, Rachel Foster Avery, a rising young leader, harshly attacked \"The Woman's Bible\", calling it a \"volume with a pretentious title \u2026 without either scholarship or literary merit.\" Avery introduced a resolution to distance the organization from Stanton's book. Despite Anthony's strong objection that such a move was unnecessary and hurtful, the resolution passed by a vote of 53 to 41. Stanton told Anthony that she should resign from her leadership post in protest, but Anthony refused. Stanton afterward grew increasingly alienated from the suffrage movement. The incident led many of the younger suffrage leaders to hold Stanton in low regard for the rest of her life.\nFinal years.\nWhen Stanton returned from her final trip to Europe in 1891, she moved in with two of her unmarried children who shared a home in New York City.\nShe increased her advocacy of \"educated suffrage,\" something she had long promoted. In 1894, she debated William Lloyd Garrison Jr. on this issue in the pages of \"Woman's Journal\". Her daughter Harriot Stanton Blatch, who was then active in the women's suffrage movement in Britain and would later be a leading figure in the U.S. movement, was disturbed by the views that Stanton expressed during this debate. She published a critique of her mother's views, saying there were many people who had not enjoyed the opportunity to acquire an education and yet were intelligent and accomplished citizens who deserved the right to vote.\nIn a letter to the 1902 NAWSA convention, Stanton continued her campaign, calling for \"a constitutional amendment requiring an educational qualification\" and saying that \"everyone who votes should read and write the English language intelligently.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI am opposed to the domination of one sex over the other. It cultivates arrogance in the one, and destroys the self-respect in the other. I am opposed to the admission of another man, either foreign or native, to the polling-booth, until woman, the greatest factor in civilization, is first enfranchised. An aristocracy of men, composed of all types, shades and degrees of intelligence and ignorance, is not the most desirable substratum for government. To subject intelligent, highly educated, virtuous, honorable women to the behests of such an aristocracy is the height of cruelty and injustice.\n\u2014\"Elizabeth Cady Stanton\", advocating \"educated suffrage\"\nIn her later years, Stanton became interested in efforts to create cooperative communities and workplaces. She was also attracted to various forms of political radicalism, applauding the Populist movement and identifying herself with socialism, especially Fabianism, a gradualist form of democratic socialism.\nIn 1898, Stanton published her memoirs, \"Eighty Years and More\", in which she presented the image of herself by which she wished to be remembered. In it, she minimized political and personal conflicts and omitted any discussion of the split in the women's movement. Largely dealing with political topics, the memoir barely mentions her mother, husband or children.\nDespite some degree of friction between Stanton and Anthony in their later years, on the dedication page Stanton said, \"I dedicate this volume to Susan B. Anthony, my steadfast friend for half a century.\"\nStanton continued to write articles prolifically for a variety of publications right up until she died.\nDeath and burial.\nStanton died in New York City on October 26, 1902, 18 years before women achieved the right to vote in the United States via the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The medical report said the cause of death was heart failure. According to her daughter Harriet, she had developed breathing problems that had begun to interfere with her work. The day before she died, Stanton told her doctor, a woman, to give her something to speed her death if the problem could not be cured.\nStanton had signed a document two years earlier directing that her brain was to be donated to Cornell University for scientific study after her death, but her wishes in that regard were not carried out. She was interred beside her husband in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.\nAfter Stanton's death, Susan B. Anthony wrote to a friend: \"Oh, this awful hush! It seems impossible that voice is stilled which I have loved to hear for fifty years. Always I have felt I must have Mrs. Stanton's opinion of things before I knew where I stood myself. I am all at sea.\"\nEven after her death, foes of women's suffrage continued to use Stanton's more unorthodox statements to promote opposition to ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment, which became law in 1920. Younger women in the suffrage movement responded by belittling Stanton and glorifying Anthony. In 1923, Alice Paul, leader of the National Woman's Party, introduced the proposed Equal Rights Amendment in Seneca Falls on the 75th anniversary of the Seneca Falls Convention. The planned ceremony and printed program made no mention of Stanton, the primary force behind the convention. One of the speakers was Stanton's daughter, Harriot Stanton Blatch, who insisted on paying tribute to her mother's role. Aside from a collection of her letters published by her children, no significant book about Stanton was written until a full-length biography was published in 1940 with the assistance of her daughter. Stanton began to regain recognition for her role in the women's rights movement with the rise of the new feminist movement in the 1960s and the establishment of academic women's history programs.\nCommemorations.\nStanton is commemorated, along with Lucretia Mott and Susan B. Anthony, in the 1921 sculpture \"Portrait Monument\" by Adelaide Johnson in the United States Capitol. Placed for years in the crypt of the capitol building, it was moved in 1997 to a more prominent location in the U.S. Capitol rotunda.\nIn 1965, the Elizabeth Cady Stanton House in Seneca Falls was declared a National Historic Landmark. It is now part of the Women's Rights National Historical Park.\nIn 1969, the group New York Radical Feminists was founded. It was organized into small cells or \"brigades\" named after notable feminists of the past; Anne Koedt and Shulamith Firestone led the Stanton-Anthony Brigade.\nIn 1973, Stanton was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.\nIn 1975, the Elizabeth Cady Stanton House in Tenafly, New Jersey, was declared a National Historic Landmark.\nIn 1982, the Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony Papers project began work as an academic undertaking to collect and document all available materials written by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. The six-volume \"The Selected Papers of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony\" was published from the 14,000 documents collected by the project. The project has since ended.\nIn 1999, Ken Burns and Paul Barnes produced the documentary \"Not for Ourselves Alone: The Story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton &amp; Susan B. Anthony\", which won a Peabody Award.\nIn 1999, a sculpture by Ted Aub was unveiled to commemorate the introduction of Stanton to Susan B. Anthony by Amelia Bloomer on May 12, 1851. This sculpture, called \"When Anthony Met Stanton,\" consists of the three women depicted as life-size bronze statues. It overlooks Van Cleef Lake in Seneca Falls, New York, where the introduction occurred.\nThe \"Elizabeth Cady Stanton Pregnant and Parenting Student Services Act\" was introduced into Congress in 2005 to fund services for students who were pregnant or already were parents. It did not become law.\nIn 2008, 37 Park Row, the site of the office of Stanton and Anthony's newspaper, \"The Revolution,\" was included in the map of Manhattan historical sites related to women's history that was created by the Office of the Manhattan Borough President.\nStanton is commemorated, together with Amelia Bloomer, Sojourner Truth, and Harriet Ross Tubman, in the calendar of saints of the Episcopal Church on July 20 of each year.\nThe U.S. Treasury Department announced in 2016 that an image of Stanton would appear on the back of a newly designed $10 bill along with Lucretia Mott, Sojourner Truth, Susan B. Anthony, Alice Paul and the 1913 Woman Suffrage Procession. New $5, $10 and $20 bills were planned to be introduced in 2020 in conjunction with the 100th anniversary of American women winning the right to vote, but were delayed.\nIn 2020, the Women's Rights Pioneers Monument was unveiled in Central Park in New York City on the 100th anniversary of the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment giving women the right to vote. Created by Meredith Bergmann, this sculpture depicts Stanton, Susan B. Anthony and Sojourner Truth engaged in animated discussion.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "43388", "revid": "910180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43388", "title": "Open Shortest Path First", "text": "Routing protocol for IP networks\nOpen Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a routing protocol for Internet Protocol (IP) networks. It uses a link state routing (LSR) algorithm and falls into the group of interior gateway protocols (IGPs), operating within a single autonomous system (AS).\nOSPF gathers link state information from available routers and constructs a topology map of the network. The topology is presented as a routing table to the internet layer for routing packets by their destination IP address. OSPF supports Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) and Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) networks and is widely used in large enterprise networks. IS-IS, another LSR-based protocol, is more common in large service provider networks.\nOriginally designed in the 1980s, OSPF version 2 is defined in RFC 2328 (1998). The updates for IPv6 are specified as OSPF version 3 in RFC 5340 (2008). OSPF supports the Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) addressing model.\nConcepts.\nOSPF is an interior gateway protocol (IGP) for routing Internet Protocol (IP) packets within a single routing domain, such as an autonomous system. It gathers link state information from available routers and constructs a topology map of the network. The topology is presented as a routing table to the internet layer, which routes packets based solely on their destination IP address.\nOSPF detects changes in the topology, such as link failures, and converges on a new loop-free routing structure within seconds. It computes the shortest-path tree for each route using a method based on Dijkstra's algorithm. The OSPF routing policies for constructing a route table are governed by link metrics associated with each routing interface. Cost factors may be the distance of a router (round-trip time), data throughput of a link, or link availability and reliability, expressed as simple unitless numbers. This provides a dynamic process of traffic load balancing between routes of equal cost.\nOSPF divides the network into routing \"areas\" to simplify administration and optimize traffic and resource utilization. Areas are identified by 32-bit numbers, expressed either simply in decimal or often in the same octet-based dot-decimal notation used for IPv4 addresses. By convention, area 0 (zero), or 0.0.0.0, represents the \"core\" or \"backbone\" area of an OSPF network. While the identifications of other areas may be chosen at will, administrators often select the IP address of a main router in an area as the area identifier. Each additional area must have a connection to the OSPF backbone area. Such connections are maintained by an interconnecting router, known as an area border router (ABR). An ABR maintains separate link-state databases for each area it serves and maintains summarized routes for all areas in the network.\nOSPF runs over IPv4 and IPv6, but does not use a transport protocol such as UDP or TCP. It encapsulates its data directly in IP packets with protocol number 89. This is in contrast to other routing protocols, such as the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) and the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). OSPF implements its own transport error detection and correction functions. OSPF also uses multicast addressing for distributing route information within a broadcast domain. It reserves the multicast addresses (IPv4) and (IPv6) for all SPF/link state routers (AllSPFRouters) and (IPv4) and (IPv6) for all Designated Routers (AllDRouters). For non-broadcast networks, special provisions for configuration facilitate neighbor discovery. OSPF multicast IP packets never traverse IP routers, they never travel more than one hop. The protocol may therefore be considered a link-layer protocol, but is often also attributed to the application layer in the TCP/IP model. It has a virtual link feature that can be used to create an adjacency tunnel across multiple hops. OSPF over IPv4 can operate securely between routers, optionally using a variety of authentication methods to allow only trusted routers to participate in routing. OSPFv3 (IPv6) relies on standard IPv6 protocol security (IPsec), and has no internal authentication methods.\nFor routing IP multicast traffic, OSPF supports the Multicast Open Shortest Path First (MOSPF) protocol. Cisco does not include MOSPF in their OSPF implementations. Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) in conjunction with OSPF or other IGPs, is widely deployed.\nOSPF version 3 introduces modifications to the IPv4 implementation of the protocol. Except for virtual links, all neighbor exchanges use IPv6 link-local addressing exclusively. The IPv6 protocol runs per link, rather than based on the subnet. All IP prefix information has been removed from the link-state advertisements and from the \"hello\" discovery packet, making OSPFv3 essentially protocol-independent. Despite the expanded IP addressing to 128 bits in IPv6, area and router Identifications are still based on 32-bit numbers.\nRouter relationships.\nOSPF supports complex networks with multiple routers, including backup routers, to balance traffic load on multiple links to other subnets. Neighboring routers in the same broadcast domain or at each end of a point-to-point link communicate with each other via the OSPF protocol. Routers form \"adjacencies\" when they have detected each other. This detection is initiated when a router identifies itself in a \"hello\" protocol packet. Upon acknowledgment, this establishes a \"two-way state\" and the most basic relationship. The routers in an Ethernet or Frame Relay network select a \"designated router\" (DR) and a \"backup designated router\" (BDR), which act as a hub to reduce traffic between routers. OSPF uses both unicast and multicast transmission modes to send \"hello\" packets and link-state updates.\nAs a link-state routing protocol, OSPF establishes and maintains neighbor relationships for exchanging routing updates with other routers. The neighbor relationship table is called an \"adjacency database\". Two OSPF routers are neighbors if they are members of the same subnet and share the same area ID, subnet mask, timers and authentication. In essence, OSPF neighborship is a relationship between two routers that allows them to see and understand each other but nothing more. OSPF neighbors do not exchange any routing information\u00a0\u2013 the only packets they exchange are hello packets. OSPF adjacencies are formed between selected neighbors and allow them to exchange routing information. Two routers must first be neighbors, and only then can they become adjacent. Two routers become adjacent if at least one of them is designated router or backup designated router (on multiaccess-type networks), or they are interconnected by a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint network type. For forming a neighbor relationship between the interfaces, the relationship must be in the same OSPF area. While an interface may be configured to belong to multiple areas, this is generally not practiced. When configured in a second area, an interface must be configured as a secondary interface.\nOperation modes.\nThe OSPF can have different operation modes on the following setups on an interface or network:\nIndirect connections.\nVirtual link over Virtual links, tunneling and sham links, are a form of connections that goes over the routing engine, and is not a direct connection to the remote host.\nAdjacency state machine.\nEach OSPF router within a network communicates with other neighboring routers on each connecting interface to establish the states of all adjacencies. Every such communication sequence is a separate \"conversation\" identified by the pair of router IDs of the communicating neighbors. RFC 2328 specifies the protocol for initiating these conversations (\"Hello Protocol\") and for establishing full adjacencies (\"database description packets\", \"link-state request packets\"). During its course, each router conversation transitions through a maximum of eight conditions defined by a state machine:\nBroadcast networks.\nIn broadcast multiple-access networks, neighbor adjacency is formed dynamically using multicast hello packets to .\n IP 192.0.2.1 &gt; 224.0.0.5: OSPFv2, hello\n IP 192.0.2.2 &gt; 224.0.0.5: OSPFv2, hello\n IP 192.0.2.1 &gt; 192.0.2.2: OSPFv2, database description\n IP 192.0.2.2 &gt; 192.0.2.1: OSPFv2, database description\nPassive network.\nA network where OSPF advertises the network, but OSPF will not start neighbor adjacency.\nNon-broadcast networks.\nIn a non-broadcast multiple-access (NBMA) network, a neighbor adjacency is formed by sending unicast packets to another router. A non-broadcast network can have more than two routers, but broadcast is not supported.\n IP 192.0.2.1 &gt; 192.0.2.2: OSPFv2, hello\n IP 192.0.2.2 &gt; 192.0.2.1: OSPFv2, hello\n IP 192.0.2.1 &gt; 192.0.2.2: OSPFv2, database description\n IP 192.0.2.2 &gt; 192.0.2.1: OSPFv2, database description\nExamples of non-broadcast networks:\nOSPF areas.\nA network is divided into OSPF \"areas\" that are logical groupings of contiguous hosts and networks. An area includes its connecting router, having an interface for each connected network link. Each router maintains a separate link-state database for the area whose information may be summarized towards the rest of the network by the connecting router. Thus, the topology of an area is unknown outside the area. This reduces the routing traffic between parts of an autonomous system.\nThough OSPF can handle thousands of routers, there is a concern reaching the capacity of the forwarding information base (FIB) table when the network contains lots of routes and lower-end devices. Modern low-end routers have a full gigabyte of RAM, which allows them to handle many routers in an area 0. Many resources refer to OSPF guides from over 20 years ago, where it was impressive to have 64\u00a0MB of RAM.\nAreas are uniquely identified with 32-bit numbers. The area identifiers are commonly written in the dot-decimal notation, familiar from IPv4 addressing. However, they are not IP addresses and may duplicate, without conflict, any IPv4 address. The area identifiers for IPv6 implementations (OSPFv3) also use 32-bit identifiers written in the same notation. When dotted formatting is omitted, most implementations expand area \"1\" to the area identifier \"0.0.0.1\", but some have been known to expand it as \"1.0.0.0\".\nSeveral vendors (Cisco, Allied Telesis, Juniper, Alcatel-Lucent, Huawei, Quagga), implement \"totally stubby\" and \"NSSA totally stubby area\" for stub and not-so-stubby areas. Although not covered by RFC standards, they are considered by many to be standard features in OSPF implementations.\nOSPF defines several area types: \nBackbone area.\nThe backbone area (also known as \"area 0\" or \"area 0.0.0.0\") forms the core of an OSPF network. All other areas are connected to it, either directly or through other routers. OSPF requires this to prevent routing loops. Inter-area routing happens via routers connected to the backbone area and to their own associated areas. It is the logical and physical structure for the 'OSPF domain' and is attached to all nonzero areas in the OSPF domain. In OSPF the term \"autonomous system boundary router\" (ASBR) is historic, in the sense that many OSPF domains can coexist in the same Internet-visible autonomous system, RFC 1996.\nAll OSPF areas must connect to the backbone area. This connection, however, can be through a virtual link. For example, assume area 0.0.0.1 has a physical connection to area 0.0.0.0. Further assume that area 0.0.0.2 has no direct connection to the backbone, but this area does have a connection to area 0.0.0.1. Area 0.0.0.2 can use a virtual link through the \"transit area\" 0.0.0.1 to reach the backbone. To be a transit area, an area has to have the transit attribute, so it cannot be stubby in any way.\nRegular area.\nA regular area is just a non-backbone (nonzero) area without a specific feature, generating and receiving summary and external LSAs. The backbone area is a special type of such area.\nIn hello packets the E-flag is not high, indicating \"External routing: not capable\"\nStub area.\nA stub area is an area that does not receive route advertisements external to the AS, and routing from within the area is based entirely on a default route. An ABR deletes type 4 and 5 LSAs from internal routers, sends them a default route of 0.0.0.0, and turns itself into a default gateway. This reduces LSDB and routing table size for internal routers.\nModifications to the basic concept of stub area have been implemented by systems vendors, such as the \"totally stubby area\" (TSA) and the \"not-so-stubby area\" (NSSA), both extensions in Cisco Systems routing equipment.\nTotally stubby area.\nA \"totally stubby area\" is similar to a stub area. However, this area does not allow \"summary\" routes in addition to not having \"external\" routes; that is, \"inter-area\" (IA) routes are not summarized into totally stubby areas. The only way for traffic to get routed outside the area is a default route, which is the only Type-3 LSA advertised into the area. When there is only one route out of the area, fewer routing decisions have to be made by the route processor, which lowers system resource utilization.\nOccasionally, it is said that a TSA can have only one ABR.\nIn hello packets the N-flag is set high, indicating \"NSSA: supported\"\nNot-so-stubby area.\nA \"not-so-stubby area\" (NSSA) is a type of stub area that can import autonomous system external routes and send them to other areas, but still cannot receive AS-external routes from other areas.\nNSSA is an extension of the stub area feature that allows the injection of external routes in a limited fashion into the stub area. A case study simulates an NSSA getting around the stub-area problem of not being able to import external addresses. It visualizes the following activities: the ASBR imports external addresses with a type 7 LSA, the ABR converts a type 7 LSA to type 5 and floods it to other areas, the ABR acts as an ASBR for other areas.\nThe ASBRs do not take type 5 LSAs and then convert to type 7 LSAs for the area.\nTotally not-so-stubby area.\nAn addition to the standard functionality of an NSSA, the \"totally stubby NSSA\" is an NSSA that takes on the attributes of a TSA, meaning that type 3 and 4 summary routes are not flooded into this type of area. It is also possible to declare an area both totally stubby and not-so-stubby, which means that the area will receive only the default route from area 0.0.0.0, but can also contain an autonomous system boundary router (ASBR) that accepts external routing information and injects it into the local area, and from the local area into area 0.0.0.0.\nRedistribution into an NSSA area creates a special type of LSA known as type 7, which can exist only in an NSSA area. An NSSA ASBR generates this LSA, and an NSSA ABR router translates it into a type 5 LSA, which gets propagated into the OSPF domain.\nA newly acquired subsidiary is one example of where it might be suitable for an area to be simultaneously not-so-stubby and totally stubby if the practical place to put an ASBR is on the edge of a totally stubby area. In such a case, the ASBR does send externals into the totally stubby area, and they are available to OSPF speakers within that area. In Cisco's implementation, the external routes can be summarized before injecting them into the totally stubby area. In general, the ASBR should not advertise default into the TSA-NSSA, although this can work with extremely careful design and operation, for the limited special cases in which such an advertisement makes sense.\nBy declaring the totally stubby area as NSSA, no external routes from the backbone, except the default route, enter the area being discussed. The externals do reach area 0.0.0.0 via the TSA-NSSA, but no routes other than the default route enter the TSA-NSSA. Routers in the TSA-NSSA send all traffic to the ABR, except to routes advertised by the ASBR.\nRouter types.\nOSPF defines the following overlapping categories of routers:\nThe router type is an attribute of an OSPF process. A given physical router may have one or more OSPF processes. For example, a router that is connected to more than one area, and which receives routes from a BGP process connected to another AS, is both an area border router and an autonomous system boundary router.\nEach router has an identifier, customarily written in the dotted-decimal format (e.g., 1.2.3.4) of an IP address. This identifier must be established in every OSPF instance. If not explicitly configured, the highest logical IP address will be duplicated as the router identifier. However, since the router identifier is not an IP address, it does not have to be a part of any routable subnet in the network, and often isn't to avoid confusion.\nNon-point-to-point network.\nOn networks (same subnet) with networks type of:\nA system of \"designated router\" (DR) and \"backup designated router\" (BDR), is used to reducing network traffic by providing a source for routing updates.\nThis is done using multicast addresses:\nThe DR and BDR maintains a complete topology table of the network and sends the updates to the other routers via multicast. All routers in a multi-access network segment will form a leader/follower relationship with the DR and BDR. They will form adjacencies with the DR and BDR only. Every time a router sends an update, it sends it to the DR and BDR on the multicast address . The DR will then send the update out to all other routers in the area, to the multicast address . This way all the routers do not have to constantly update each other, and can rather get all their updates from a single source. The use of multicasting further reduces the network load. DRs and BDRs are always setup/elected on OSPF broadcast networks. DR's can also be elected on NBMA (Non-Broadcast Multi-Access) networks such as Frame Relay or ATM. DRs or BDRs are not elected on point-to-point links (such as a point-to-point WAN connection) because the two routers on either side of the link must become fully adjacent and the bandwidth between them cannot be further optimized. DR and non-DR routers evolve from 2-way to full adjacency relationships by exchanging DD, Request, and Update.\nDesignated router.\nA \"designated router\" (DR) is the router interface elected among all routers on a particular multiaccess network segment, generally assumed to be broadcast multiaccess. Special techniques, often vendor-dependent, may be needed to support the DR function on non-broadcast multiaccess (NBMA) media. It is usually wise to configure the individual virtual circuits of an NBMA subnet as individual point-to-point lines; the techniques used are implementation-dependent.\nBackup designated router.\nA \"backup designated router\" (BDR) is a router that becomes the designated router if the current designated router has a problem or fails. The BDR is the OSPF router with the second-highest priority at the time of the last election.\nA given router can have some interfaces that are designated (DR) and others that are backup designated (BDR), and others that are non-designated. If no router is a DR or a BDR on a given subnet, the BDR is first elected, and then a second election is held for the DR.\nDR Other.\nA router that has not been selected to be \"designated router\" (DR) or \"backup designated router\" (BDR). The router forms an adjacency to both the \"designated router\" (DR) and the \"backup designated router\" (BDR).\nFor other non (B)DR, the adjacency stops at \"2-ways\" State.\nDesignated router election.\nThe DR is elected based on the following default criteria:\nProtocol messages.\nUnlike other routing protocols, OSPF does not carry data via a transport protocol, such as the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) or the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Instead, OSPF forms IP datagrams directly, packaging them using protocol number 89 for the IP Protocol field. OSPF defines five different message types, for various types of communication. Multiple packets can be sent per frame.\nOSPF uses 5 packet types:\nHello Packet.\nOSPF's Hello messages are used as a form of greeting, to allow a router to discover other adjacent routers on its local links and networks. The messages establish relationships between neighboring devices (called adjacencies) and communicate key parameters about how OSPF is to be used in the autonomous system or area. During normal operation, routers send hello messages to their neighbors at regular intervals (the \"hello interval\"); if a router stops receiving hello messages from a neighbor, after a set period (the \"dead interval\") the router will assume the neighbor has gone down.\nDatabase description (DBD).\n\"Database description\" messages contain descriptions of the topology of the autonomous system or area. They convey the contents of the link-state database (LSDB) for the area from one router to another. Communicating a large LSDB may require several messages to be sent by having the sending device designated as a leader device and sending messages in sequence, with the follower (recipient of the LSDB information) responding with acknowledgments.\nLink state packets.\nOSPF v2 area types and accepted LSAs.\nNot all area types use all LSA. Below is a matrix of accepted LSAs.\nRouting metrics.\nOSPF uses \"path cost\" as its basic routing metric, which was defined by the standard not to equate to any standard value such as speed, so the network designer could pick a metric important to the design. In practice, it is determined by comparing the speed of the interface to a reference-bandwidth for the OSPF process. The cost is determined by dividing the reference bandwidth by the interface speed (although the cost for any interface can be manually overridden). Here is an example table that shows the routing metric or 'cost calculation' on an interface.\nOSPF is a layer 3 protocol. If a layer 2 switch is between the two devices running OSPF, one side may negotiate a speed different from the other side. This can create an asymmetric routing on the link (Router 1 to Router 2 could cost '1' and the return path could cost '10'), which may lead to unintended consequences.\nMetrics, however, are only directly comparable when of the same type. Four types of metrics are recognized. In decreasing preference (for example, an intra-area route is always preferred to an external route regardless of metric), these types are:\nOSPF v3.\nOSPF version 3 introduces modifications to the IPv4 implementation of the protocol. \nDespite the expansion of addresses to 128 bits in IPv6, area and router identifications are still 32-bit numbers.\nOSPF over MPLS VPN.\nA customer can use OSPF over a MPLS VPN, where the service provider uses BGP or RIP as their interior gateway protocol.\nWhen using OSPF over MPLS VPN, the VPN backbone becomes part of the OSPF backbone area 0. In all areas, isolated copies of the IGP are run.\nAdvantages: \nTo achieve this, a modified OSPF-BGP redistribution is used. All OSPF routes retain the source LSA type and metric.\nTo prevent loops, an optional DN bit is set by the service provider in LSAs from the provider equipment to indicate that a route has already been sent to the customer's equipment.\nOSPF extensions.\nTraffic engineering.\nOSPF-TE is an extension to OSPF, extending the expressivity to allow for traffic engineering and use on non-IP networks. Using OSPF-TE, more information about the topology can be exchanged using opaque LSA carrying type\u2013length\u2013value elements. These extensions allow OSPF-TE to run completely out of band of the data plane network. This means that it can also be used on non-IP networks, such as optical networks.\nOSPF-TE is used in GMPLS networks as a means to describe the topology over which GMPLS paths can be established. GMPLS uses its own path setup and forwarding protocols once it has the full network map.\nIn the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP), OSPF-TE is used for recording and flooding RSVP signaled bandwidth reservations for label-switched paths within the link-state database.\nOptical routing.\n documents work in optical routing for IP based on extensions to OSPF and IS-IS.\nMulticast Open Shortest Path First.\nThe Multicast Open Shortest Path First (MOSPF) protocol is an extension to OSPF to support multicast routing. MOSPF allows routers to share information about group memberships.\nApplications.\nOSPF is a widely deployed routing protocol that can converge a network in a few seconds and guarantee loop-free paths. It has many features that allow the imposition of policies about the propagation of routes that may be appropriate to keep local, for load sharing, and for selective route importing. IS-IS, in contrast, can be tuned for lower overhead in a stable network, the sort more common in ISP than enterprise networks. There are some historical accidents that made IS-IS the preferred IGP for ISPs, but ISPs today may well choose to use the features of the now-efficient implementations of OSPF, after first considering the pros and cons of IS-IS in service provider environments.\n When the default route to an ISP is injected into OSPF from multiple ASBRs as a Type I external route and the same external cost specified, other routers will go to the ASBR with the least path cost from its location. This can be tuned further by adjusting the external cost. If the default route from different ISPs is injected with different external costs, as a Type II external route, the lower-cost default becomes the primary exit and the higher-cost becomes the backup only.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "43389", "revid": "49757636", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43389", "title": "Routing Information Protocol", "text": "Computer network protocol\nThe Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is one of the oldest distance-vector routing protocols which employs the hop count as a routing metric. RIP prevents routing loops by implementing a limit on the number of hops allowed in a path from source to destination. The largest number of hops allowed for RIP is 15, which limits the size of networks that RIP can support.\nRIP implements the split horizon, route poisoning, and holddown mechanisms to prevent incorrect routing information from being propagated.\nIn RIPv1 routers broadcast updates with their routing table every 30 seconds. In the early deployments, routing tables were small enough that the traffic was not significant. As networks grew in size, however, it became evident there could be a massive traffic burst every 30 seconds, even if the routers had been initialized at random times.\nIn most networking environments, RIP is not the preferred choice of routing protocol, as its time to converge and scalability are poor compared to EIGRP, OSPF, or IS-IS. However, it is easy to configure, because RIP does not require any parameters, unlike other protocols.\nRIP uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) as its transport protocol, and is assigned the reserved port number 520.\nDevelopment of distance-vector routing.\nBased on the Bellman\u2013Ford algorithm and the Ford\u2013Fulkerson algorithm, distance-vector routing protocols started to be implemented from 1969 onwards in data networks such as the ARPANET and CYCLADES. The predecessor of RIP was the Gateway Information Protocol (GWINFO) which was developed by Xerox in the mid-1970s to route its experimental network. As part of the Xerox Network Systems (XNS) protocol suite GWINFO transformed into the XNS Routing Information Protocol. This XNS RIP in turn became the basis for early routing protocols, such as Novell's IPX RIP, AppleTalk's Routing Table Maintenance Protocol (RTMP), and the IP RIP. The 1982 Berkeley Software Distribution of the UNIX operating system implemented RIP in the \"routed\" daemon. The 4.2BSD release proved popular and became the basis for subsequent UNIX versions, which implemented RIP in the \"routed\" or \"gated\" daemon. Ultimately, RIP had been extensively deployed before the standard, written by Charles Hedrick, was passed as RIPv1 in 1988.\nThe RIP hop count.\nThe routing metric used by RIP counts the number of routers that need to be passed to reach a destination IP network. The hop count 0 denotes a network that is directly connected to the router. 16 hops denote a network that is unreachable, according to the RIP hop limit.\nVersions.\nThere are three standardized versions of the Routing Information Protocol: \"RIPv1\" and \"RIPv2\" for IPv4, and \"RIPng\" for IPv6.\nRIP version 1.\nThe original specification of RIP was published in 1988. When starting up, and every 30 seconds thereafter, a router with RIPv1 implementation broadcasts to a request message through every RIPv1 enabled interface. Neighbouring routers receiving the request message respond with a RIPv1 segment, containing their routing table. The requesting router updates its own routing table, with the reachable IP network address, hop count and next hop, that is the router interface IP address from which the RIPv1 response was sent. As the requesting router receives updates from different neighbouring routers it will only update the reachable networks in its routing table, if it receives information about a reachable network it has not yet in its routing table or information that a network it has in its routing table is reachable with a lower hop count. Therefore, a RIPv1 router will in most cases only have one entry for a reachable network, the one with the lowest hop count. If a router receives information from two different neighbouring router that the same network is reachable with the same hop count but via two different routes, the network will be entered into the routing table two times with different next hop routers. The RIPv1 enabled router will then perform what is known as equal-cost load balancing for IP packets.\nRIPv1 enabled routers not only request the routing tables of other routers every 30 seconds, they also listen to incoming requests from neighbouring routers and send their own routing table in turn. RIPv1 routing tables are therefore updated every 25 to 35 seconds. The RIPv1 protocol adds a small random time variable to the update time, to avoid routing tables synchronizing across a LAN. It was thought, as a result of random initialization, the routing updates would spread out in time, but this was not true in practice. Sally Floyd and Van Jacobson showed in 1994 that, without slight randomization of the update timer, the timers synchronized over time.\nRIPv1 can be configured into silent mode, so that a router requests and processes neighbouring routing tables, and keeps its routing table and hop count for reachable networks up to date, but does not needlessly send its own routing table into the network. Silent mode is commonly implemented to hosts.\nRIPv1 uses classful routing. The periodic routing updates do not carry subnet information, lacking support for variable length subnet masks (VLSM). This limitation makes it impossible to have different-sized subnets inside of the same network class. In other words, all subnets in a network class must have the same size. There is also no support for router authentication, making RIP vulnerable to various attacks.\nRIP version 2.\nDue to the deficiencies of the original RIP specification, RIP version 2 (RIPv2) was developed in 1993, published in 1994, and declared Internet Standard 56 in 1998. It included the ability to carry subnet information, thus supporting Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR). To maintain backward compatibility, the hop count limit of 15 remained. RIPv2 has facilities to fully interoperate with the earlier specification if all \"Must Be Zero\" protocol fields in the RIPv1 messages are properly specified. In addition, a \"compatibility switch\" feature allows fine-grained interoperability adjustments.\nIn an effort to avoid unnecessary load on hosts that do not participate in routing, RIPv2 \"multicasts\" the entire routing table to all adjacent routers at the address , as opposed to RIPv1 which uses broadcast. Unicast addressing is still allowed for special applications.\n(MD5) authentication for RIP was introduced in 1997.\nRoute tags were also added in RIP version 2. This functionality allows a distinction between routes learned from the RIP protocol and routes learned from other protocols.\nRIPng.\nRIPng (RIP next generation) is an extension of RIPv2 for support of IPv6, the next generation Internet Protocol. The main differences between RIPv2 and RIPng are:\nRIPng sends updates on UDP port 521 using the multicast group .\nRIP messages between routers.\nRIP messages use the User Datagram Protocol on port 520 and all RIP messages exchanged between routers are encapsulated in a UDP datagram.\nRIPv1 Messages.\nRIP defined two types of messages:\nAsking a neighbouring RIPv1 enabled router to send its routing table.\nCarries the routing table of a router.\nTimers.\nThe routing information protocol uses the following timers as part of its operation:\nControls the interval between two gratuitous Response Messages. By default the value is 30 seconds. The response message is broadcast to all its RIP enabled interface.\nThe invalid timer specifies how long a routing entry can be in the routing table without being updated. This is also called as expiration Timer. By default, the value is 180 seconds. After the timer expires the hop count of the routing entry will be set to 16, marking the destination as unreachable.\nThe flush timer controls the time between the route is invalidated or marked as unreachable and removal of entry from the routing table. By default the value is 240 seconds. This is 60 seconds longer than Invalid timer. So for 60 seconds the router will be advertising about this unreachable route to all its neighbours. This timer must be set to a higher value than the \"invalid timer.\"\nThe hold-down timer is started per route entry, when the hop count is changing from lower value to higher value. This allows the route to get stabilized. During this time no update can be done to that routing entry. This is not part of the RFC 1058. This is Cisco's implementation. The default value of this timer is 180 seconds.\nSimilar protocols.\nCisco's proprietary Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP) was a somewhat more capable protocol than RIP. It belongs to the same basic family of distance-vector routing protocols. \nCisco has ceased support and distribution of IGRP in their router software. It was replaced by the Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) which is a completely new design. While EIGRP still uses a distance-vector model, it relates to IGRP only in using the same composite routing metric. Both IGRP and EIGRP calculated a single composite metric for each route, from a formula of five variables: bandwidth, delay, reliability, load, and MTU; though on Cisco routers, by default, only bandwidth and delay are used in this calculation.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He graduated with a doctorate thesis about ice shields in Nordic areas. Between 1888 and 1891, he was an assistant at the Geodetic Institute and the Central Office of International Geodetics in Berlin.\nDrygalski led two expeditions between 1891 and 1893, which were supplied by the Society for Geoscience of Berlin. One expedition wintered during the winter between 1892 and 1893 in Western Greenland. He habilitated 1889 for geography and geophysics with the collected scientific evidence. In 1898, Drygalski became associate professor and 1899 extraordinary professor for geography and geophysics in Berlin.\n\"Gauss\" expedition.\nDrygalski led the first German South Polar expedition with the ship \"Gauss\" to explore the unknown area of Antarctica lying south of the Kerguelen Islands. The expedition started from Kiel in the summer of 1901. A small party of the expedition was also stationed on the Kerguelen Islands, while the main party proceeded further south. Drygalski also paid a brief call to Heard Island and provided the first comprehensive scientific information on the island's geology, flora and fauna. Despite being trapped by ice for nearly fourteen months until February 1903, the expedition discovered new territory in Antarctica, the Kaiser Wilhelm II Land with the Gaussberg. The expedition arrived back in Kiel in November 1903. Subsequently, Drygalski wrote the narrative of the expedition and edited the voluminous scientific data. Between 1905 and 1931, he published twenty volumes and two atlases documenting the expedition and was awarded the 1933 Royal Geographical Society's Patron's Medal.\nLater years.\nFrom October 1906 until his retirement, Drygalski was a professor in Munich, where he also presided the Geographic Institute, founded by him, until his death.

He created the philosophical school known as process philosophy, which has been applied in a wide variety of disciplines, including ecology, theology, education, physics, biology, economics, and psychology.\nIn his early career Whitehead wrote primarily on mathematics, logic, and physics. He wrote the three-volume \"Principia Mathematica\" (1910\u20131913), with his former student Bertrand Russell. \"Principia Mathematica\" is considered one of the twentieth century's most important works in mathematical logic, and placed 23rd in a list of the top 100 English-language nonfiction books of the twentieth century by Modern Library.\nBeginning in the late 1910s and early 1920s, Whitehead gradually turned his attention from mathematics to philosophy of science, and finally to metaphysics. He developed a comprehensive metaphysical system which radically departed from most of Western philosophy. Whitehead argued that reality consists of processes rather than material objects, and that processes are best defined by their relations with other processes, thus rejecting the theory that reality is fundamentally constructed by bits of matter that exist independently of one another. Whitehead's philosophical works\u00a0\u2013 particularly \"Process and Reality\"\u00a0\u2013 are regarded as the foundational texts of process philosophy.\nWhitehead's process philosophy argues that \"there is urgency in coming to see the world as a web of interrelated processes of which we are integral parts, so that all of our choices and actions have consequences for the world around us.\" For this reason, one of the most promising applications of Whitehead's thought in the 21st century has been in the area of ecological civilization and environmental ethics pioneered by John B. Cobb.\nLife.\nChildhood and education.\nAlfred North Whitehead was born in Ramsgate, Kent, England, in 1861. His father, Alfred Whitehead, became an Anglican minister after being headmaster of Chatham House Academy, a school for boys previously headed by Alfred's father, Thomas Whitehead. Whitehead himself recalled both of them as being very successful schoolmasters, with his grandfather being the more \"remarkable\" man.\nWhitehead's mother was Maria Sarah Buckmaster. Her maternal great-grandmother was Jane North (1776\u20131847), whose maiden surname was given to Whitehead, and several other members of his family over time. His mother, Maria Buckmaster had eleven siblings. The son of her brother Thomas, Walter Selby Buckmaster, was twice an Olympics silver medal winner for Polo (1900, 1908) for Britain, and is said to be \"one of the finest polo players England has ever produced\". Whitehead does not appear to have been close to his mother, although he and Evelyn (full name: Evelyn Ada Maud Rice Willoughby Wade), whom he married in 1890, are recorded in the English Census of 1891 as living with Alfred's mother and father. Lowe notes that there appears to have been mutual dislike between Whitehead's wife, Evelyn, and his mother, Maria.\nGriffin relates how Bertrand Russell, a colleague and collaborator of Whitehead, was a very close friend of Whitehead and of his wife, Evelyn. Griffin retells Russell's story of how, one evening in 1901, \"they found Evelyn Whitehead in the middle of what appeared to be a dangerous and acutely painful angina attack. ... [but] It seems that she suffered from a psychosomatic disorder ... [and] the danger was illusory.\" Griffin posits that Russell exaggerated the drama of her illness, and that both Evelyn and Russell were habitually given to melodrama. Intensity of emotion was encouraged by their avant-garde associates in the turbulent Bloomsbury Group which \"discussed aesthetic and philosophical questions in a spirit of agnosticism and were strongly influenced by G.E. Moore's \"Principia Ethica\" (1903) and by A. N. Whitehead's and Bertrand Russell's \"Principia Mathematica\" (1910\u201313), in the light of which they searched for definitions of the good, the true, and the beautiful\".\nAlfred's brother Henry became Bishop of Madras and wrote the closely observed ethnographic account \"Village Gods of South-India\" (Calcutta: Association Press, 1921).\nWhitehead was educated at Sherborne, a prominent English public school, where he excelled in sports and mathematics and was head prefect of his class.\nIn 1880, he began attending Trinity College, Cambridge, and studied mathematics. His academic advisor was Edward Routh. He earned his B.A. from Trinity in 1884, writing his dissertation on James Clerk Maxwell's \"A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism\", and graduated as fourth wrangler.\nCareer.\nElected a fellow of Trinity in 1884, Whitehead would teach and write on mathematics and physics at the college until 1910, spending the 1890s writing his \"Treatise on Universal Algebra\" (1898), and the 1900s collaborating with his former pupil, Bertrand Russell, on the first edition of \"Principia Mathematica\". He was a Cambridge Apostle.\nIn 1910, Whitehead resigned his senior lectureship in mathematics at Trinity and moved to London without first obtaining another job. After being unemployed for a year, he accepted a position as lecturer in applied mathematics and mechanics at University College London but was passed over a year later for the Goldsmid Chair of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics, a position for which he had hoped to be seriously considered.\nIn 1914, Whitehead accepted a position as professor of applied mathematics at the newly chartered Imperial College London, where his old friend Andrew Forsyth had recently been appointed chief professor of mathematics.\nIn 1918, Whitehead's academic responsibilities began to seriously expand as he accepted a number of high administrative positions within the University of London system, of which Imperial College London was a member at the time. He was elected dean of the Faculty of Science at the University of London in late 1918 (a post he held for four years), a member of the University of London's Senate in 1919, and chairman of the Senate's Academic (leadership) Council in 1920, a post which he held until he departed for America in 1924. Whitehead was able to exert his newfound influence to successfully lobby for a new history of science department, help establish a Bachelor of Science degree (previously only Bachelor of Arts degrees had been offered), and make the school more accessible to less wealthy students.\nToward the end of his time in England, Whitehead turned his attention to philosophy. Though he had no advanced training in philosophy, his philosophical work soon became highly regarded. After publishing \"The Concept of Nature\" in 1920, he served as president of the Aristotelian Society from 1922 to 1923.\nMove to the United States, 1924.\nIn 1924, Henry Osborn Taylor invited the 63-year-old Whitehead to join the faculty at Harvard University as a professor of philosophy. The Whiteheads would spend the rest of their lives in the United States.\nDuring his time at Harvard, Whitehead produced some of his most important philosophical contributions. In 1925, he wrote \"Science and the Modern World\", which was immediately hailed as an alternative to the Cartesian dualism then prevalent in popular science. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences that same year. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1926. Lectures from 1927 to 1928, were published in 1929 as a book named \"Process and Reality\", which has been compared to Immanuel Kant's \"Critique of Pure Reason\".\nFamily and death.\nIn 1890, Whitehead married Evelyn Wade, an Irishwoman raised in France; they had a daughter, Jessie, and two sons, Thomas and Eric. Thomas followed his father to Harvard in 1931, to teach at the Business School. Eric died in action at the age of 19, while serving in the Royal Flying Corps during World War I.\nFrom 1910, the Whiteheads had a cottage in the village of Lockeridge, near Marlborough, Wiltshire; from there he completed \"Principia Mathematica\".\nThe Whiteheads remained in the United States after moving to Harvard in 1924. Alfred retired from Harvard in 1937 and remained in Cambridge, Massachusetts, until his death on 30 December 1947.\nLegacy.\nThe two-volume biography of Whitehead by Victor Lowe is the most definitive presentation of the life of Whitehead. However, many details of Whitehead's life remain obscure because he left no \"Nachlass\" (personal archive); his family carried out his instructions that all of his papers be destroyed after his death. Additionally, Whitehead was known for his \"almost fanatical belief in the right to privacy,\" and for writing very few personal letters of the kind that would help to gain insight on his life. Wrote Lowe in his preface, \"No professional biographer in his right mind would touch him.\"\nLed by Executive Editor Brian G. Henning and General Editor George R. Lucas Jr., the Whitehead Research Project of the Center for Process Studies is currently working on a critical edition of Whitehead's published and unpublished works. The first volume of the \"Edinburgh Critical Edition of the Complete Works of Alfred North Whitehead\" was published in 2017 by Paul A. Bogaard and Jason Bell as \"The Harvard Lectures of Alfred North Whitehead, 1924\u20131925: The Philosophical Presuppositions of Science\".\nMathematics and logic.\nIn addition to numerous articles on mathematics, Whitehead wrote three major books on the subject: \"A Treatise on Universal Algebra\" (1898), \"Principia Mathematica\" (co-written with Bertrand Russell and published in three volumes between 1910 and 1913), and \"An Introduction to Mathematics\" (1911). The former two books were aimed exclusively at professional mathematicians, while the latter book was intended for a larger audience, covering the history of mathematics and its philosophical foundations. \"Principia Mathematica\" in particular is regarded as one of the most important works in mathematical logic of the 20th century.\nIn addition to his legacy as a co-writer of \"Principia Mathematica\", Whitehead's theory of \"extensive abstraction\" is considered foundational for the branch of ontology and computer science known as \"mereotopology,\" a theory describing spatial relations among wholes, parts, parts of parts, and the boundaries between parts.\n\"A Treatise on Universal Algebra\".\nIn \"A Treatise on Universal Algebra\" (1898), the term \"universal algebra\" had essentially the same meaning that it has today: the study of algebraic structures themselves, rather than examples (\"models\") of algebraic structures. Whitehead credits William Rowan Hamilton and Augustus De Morgan as originators of the subject matter, and James Joseph Sylvester with coining the term itself.\nAt the time, structures such as Lie algebras and hyperbolic quaternions drew attention to the need to expand algebraic structures beyond the associatively multiplicative class. In a review Alexander Macfarlane wrote: \"The main idea of the work is not unification of the several methods, nor generalization of ordinary algebra so as to include them, but rather the comparative study of their several structures.\" In a separate review, G.\u00a0B. Mathews wrote, \"It possesses a unity of design which is really remarkable, considering the variety of its themes.\"\n\"A Treatise on Universal Algebra\" sought to examine Hermann Grassmann's theory of extension (\"Ausdehnungslehre\"), Boole's algebra of logic, and Hamilton's quaternions (this last number system was to be taken up in Volume II, which was never finished due to Whitehead's work on \"Principia Mathematica\"). Whitehead wrote in the preface:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Such algebras have an intrinsic value for separate detailed study; also they are worthy of comparative study, for the sake of the light thereby thrown on the general theory of symbolic reasoning, and on algebraic symbolism in particular... The idea of a generalized conception of space has been made prominent, in the belief that the properties and operations involved in it can be made to form a uniform method of interpretation of the various algebras.\nWhitehead, however, had no results of a general nature. His hope of \"form[ing] a uniform method of interpretation of the various algebras\" presumably would have been developed in Volume II, had Whitehead completed it. Further work on the subject was minimal until the early 1930s when Garrett Birkhoff and \u00d8ystein Ore began publishing on universal algebras.\n\"Principia Mathematica\".\n\"Principia Mathematica\" (1910\u20131913) is Whitehead's most famous mathematical work. Written with former student Bertrand Russell, \"Principia Mathematica\" is considered one of the twentieth century's most important works in mathematics and placed 23rd in a list of the top 100 English-language nonfiction books of the twentieth century by Modern Library.\n\"Principia Mathematica\"'s purpose was to describe a set of axioms and inference rules in symbolic logic from which all mathematical truths could in principle be proven. Whitehead and Russell were working on such a foundational level of mathematics and logic that it took them until page 86 of Volume II to prove that 1+1=2, a proof humorously accompanied by the comment, \"The above proposition is occasionally useful.\"\nWhitehead and Russell had thought originally that \"Principia Mathematica\" would take a year to complete; it ended up taking them ten years. When it came time for publication, the three-volume work was so long (more than 2,000 pages) and its audience so narrow (professional mathematicians) that it was initially published at a loss of 600 pounds, 300 of which was paid by Cambridge University Press, 200 by the Royal Society of London, and 50 apiece by Whitehead and Russell themselves. Despite the initial loss, today there is likely no major academic library in the world that does not hold a copy of \"Principia Mathematica\".\n\"Principia Mathematica\"'s legacy is mixed. It is generally accepted that Kurt G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem of 1931 definitively demonstrated that, for any set of axioms and inference rules proposed to encapsulate mathematics, there would in fact be some truths of mathematics that could not be deduced from them, and hence that \"Principia Mathematica\" could never achieve its aims. However, G\u00f6del could not have come to this conclusion without Whitehead and Russell's book. In this way, \"Principia Mathematica\"'s legacy might be described as its key role in disproving the possibility of achieving its own stated goals. But beyond this somewhat ironic legacy, the book popularized modern mathematical logic and drew important connections between logic, epistemology, and metaphysics.\n\"An Introduction to Mathematics\".\nUnlike Whitehead's previous two books on mathematics, \"An Introduction to Mathematics\" (1911) was not aimed exclusively at professional mathematicians but was intended for a larger audience. The book covered the nature of mathematics, its unity and internal structure, and its applicability to nature. Whitehead wrote in the opening chapter:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The object of the following Chapters is not to teach mathematics, but to enable students from the very beginning of their course to know what the science is about, and why it is necessarily the foundation of exact thought as applied to natural phenomena.\nThe book can be seen as an attempt to understand the growth in unity and interconnection of mathematics as a whole, as well as an examination of the mutual influence of mathematics and philosophy, language, and physics. Although the book is little-read, in some ways it prefigures certain points of Whitehead's later work in philosophy and metaphysics.\nViews on education.\nWhitehead showed a deep concern for educational reform at all levels. In addition to his numerous individually written works on the subject, Whitehead was appointed by Britain's Prime Minister David Lloyd George as part of a 20-person committee to investigate the educational systems and practices of the UK in 1921 and recommend reform.\nWhitehead's most complete work on education is the 1929 book \"The Aims of Education and Other Essays\", which collected numerous essays and addresses by Whitehead on the subject published between 1912 and 1927. The essay from which \"Aims of Education\" derived its name was delivered as an address in 1916 when Whitehead was president of the London Branch of the Mathematical Association. In it, he cautioned against the teaching of what he called \"inert ideas\" \u2013 ideas that are disconnected scraps of information, with no application to real life or culture. He opined that \"education with inert ideas is not only useless: it is, above all things, harmful.\"\nRather than teach small parts of a large number of subjects, Whitehead advocated teaching a relatively few important concepts that the student could organically link to many different areas of knowledge, discovering their application in actual life. For Whitehead, education should be the exact opposite of the multidisciplinary, value-free school model \u2013 it should be \"trans\"disciplinary, and laden with values and general principles that provide students with a bedrock of wisdom and help them to make connections between areas of knowledge that are usually regarded as separate.\nIn order to make this sort of teaching a reality, however, Whitehead pointed to the need to minimize the importance of (or radically alter) standard examinations for school entrance. Whitehead writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Every school is bound on pain of extinction to train its boys for a small set of definite examinations. No headmaster has a free hand to develop his general education or his specialist studies in accordance with the opportunities of his school, which are created by its staff, its environment, its class of boys, and its endowments. I suggest that no system of external tests which aims primarily at examining individual scholars can result in anything but educational waste.\nWhitehead argued that curriculum should be developed specifically for its own students by its own staff, or else risk total stagnation, interrupted only by occasional movements from one group of inert ideas to another.\nAbove all else in his educational writings, Whitehead emphasized the importance of imagination and the free play of ideas. In his essay \"Universities and Their Function\", Whitehead writes provocatively on imagination:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Imagination is not to be divorced from the facts: it is a way of illuminating the facts. It works by eliciting the general principles which apply to the facts, as they exist, and then by an intellectual survey of alternative possibilities which are consistent with those principles. It enables men to construct an intellectual vision of a new world.\nWhitehead's philosophy of education might adequately be summarized in his statement that \"knowledge does not keep any better than fish\". In other words, bits of disconnected knowledge are meaningless; all knowledge must find some imaginative application to the students' own lives, or else it becomes useless trivia, and the students themselves become good at parroting facts but not thinking for themselves.\nPhilosophy and metaphysics.\nWhitehead did not begin his career as a philosopher. In fact, he never had any formal training in philosophy beyond his undergraduate education. Early in his life, he showed great interest in and respect for philosophy and metaphysics, but it is evident that he considered himself a rank amateur. In one letter to his friend and former student Bertrand Russell, after discussing whether science aimed to be explanatory or merely descriptive, he wrote: \"This further question lands us in the ocean of metaphysic, onto which my profound ignorance of that science forbids me to enter.\" Ironically, in later life, Whitehead would become one of the 20th century's foremost metaphysicians.\nHowever, interest in metaphysics \u2013 the philosophical investigation of the nature of the universe and existence \u2013 had become unfashionable by the time Whitehead began writing in earnest about it in the 1920s. The ever-more impressive accomplishments of empirical science had led to a general consensus in academia that the development of comprehensive metaphysical systems was a waste of time because they were not subject to empirical testing.\nWhitehead was unimpressed by this objection. In the notes of one of his students for a 1927 class, Whitehead was quoted as saying: \"Every scientific man in order to preserve his reputation has to say he dislikes metaphysics. What he means is he dislikes having his metaphysics criticized.\" In Whitehead's view, scientists and philosophers make metaphysical assumptions about how the universe works all the time, but such assumptions are not easily seen precisely because they remain unexamined and unquestioned. While Whitehead acknowledged that \"philosophers can never hope finally to formulate these metaphysical first principles\", he argued that people need to continually reimagine their basic assumptions about how the universe works if philosophy and science are to make any real progress, even if that progress remains permanently asymptotic. For this reason, Whitehead regarded metaphysical investigations as essential to both good science and good philosophy.\nPerhaps foremost among what Whitehead considered faulty metaphysical assumptions was the Cartesian idea that reality is fundamentally constructed of bits of matter that exist totally independently of one another, which he rejected in favour of an event-based or \"process\" ontology in which events are primary and are fundamentally interrelated and dependent on one another. He also argued that the most basic elements of reality can all be regarded as experiential, indeed that everything is constituted by its experience. He used the term \"experience\" very broadly so that even inanimate processes such as electron collisions are said to manifest some degree of experience. In this, he went against Descartes' separation of two different kinds of real existence, either exclusively material or else exclusively mental. Whitehead referred to his metaphysical system as the \"philosophy of organism,\" but it would become known more widely as \"process philosophy.\"\nWhitehead's philosophy was highly original, and soon garnered interest in philosophical circles. After publishing \"The Concept of Nature\" in 1920, he served as president of the Aristotelian Society from 1922 to 1923, and Henri Bergson was quoted as saying that Whitehead was \"the best philosopher writing in English.\" So impressive and different was Whitehead's philosophy that in 1924 he was invited to join the faculty at Harvard University as a professor of philosophy at 63 years of age.\nThis is not to say that Whitehead's thought was widely accepted or even well understood. His philosophical work is generally considered to be among the most difficult to understand in all of the Western canon. Even professional philosophers struggled to follow Whitehead's writings. One famous story illustrating the level of difficulty of Whitehead's philosophy centres around the delivery of Whitehead's Gifford lectures in 1927\u201328 \u2013 following Arthur Eddington's lectures of the year previous \u2013 which Whitehead would later publish as \"Process and Reality\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Eddington was a marvellous popular lecturer who had enthralled an audience of 600 for his entire course. The same audience turned up to Whitehead's first lecture but it was completely unintelligible, not merely to the world at large but to the elect. My father remarked to me afterwards that if he had not known Whitehead well he would have suspected that it was an imposter making it up as he went along... The audience at subsequent lectures was only about half a dozen in all.\nIt may not be inappropriate to speculate that some fair portion of the respect generally shown to Whitehead by his philosophical peers at the time arose from their sheer bafflement. The Chicago theologian Shailer Mathews once remarked of Whitehead's 1926 book \"Religion in the Making\": \"It is infuriating, and I must say embarrassing as well, to read page after page of relatively familiar words without understanding a single sentence.\"\nHowever, Mathews' frustration with Whitehead's books did not negatively affect his interest. In fact, there were numerous philosophers and theologians at Chicago's Divinity School who perceived the importance of what Whitehead was doing without fully grasping all of the details and implications. In 1927, they invited one of America's only Whitehead experts, Henry Nelson Wieman, to Chicago to give a lecture explaining Whitehead's thoughts. Wieman's lecture was so brilliant that he was promptly hired to the faculty and taught there for twenty years, and for at least thirty years afterwards Chicago's Divinity School was closely associated with Whitehead's thought.\nShortly after Whitehead's book \"Process and Reality\" appeared in 1929, Wieman famously wrote in his 1930 review:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Not many people will read Whitehead's recent book in this generation; not many will read it in any generation. But its influence will radiate through concentric circles of popularization until the common man will think and work in the light of it, not knowing whence the light came. After a few decades of discussion and analysis, one will be able to understand it more readily than can now be done.\nWieman's words proved prophetic. Though \"Process and Reality\" has been called \"arguably the most impressive single metaphysical text of the twentieth century,\" it has been little-read and little-understood, partly because it demands \u2013 as Isabelle Stengers puts it \u2013 \"that its readers accept the adventure of the questions that will separate them from every consensus.\" Whitehead questioned Western philosophy's most dearly held assumptions about how the universe works \u2013 but in doing so, he managed to anticipate a number of 21st century scientific and philosophical problems and provide novel solutions.\nWhitehead's conception of reality.\nWhitehead was convinced that the scientific notion of matter was misleading as a way of describing the ultimate nature of things. In his 1925 book \"Science and the Modern World\", he wrote that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn Whitehead's view, there are a number of problems with this notion of \"irreducible brute matter\". First, it obscures and minimizes the importance of change. By thinking of any material thing (like a rock, or a person) as being fundamentally the \"same\" thing throughout time, with any changes to it being secondary to its \"nature\", scientific materialism hides the fact that nothing ever stays the same. For Whitehead, change is fundamental and inescapable; he emphasizes that \"all things flow\".\nIn Whitehead's view, then, concepts such as \"quality\", \"matter\", and \"form\" are problematic. These \"classical\" concepts fail to adequately account for change, and overlook the active and experiential nature of the most basic elements of the world. They are useful abstractions but are not the world's basic building blocks. What is ordinarily conceived of as a single person, for instance, is philosophically described as a continuum of overlapping events. After all, people change all the time, if only because they have aged by another second and had some further experience. These occasions of experience are logically distinct but are progressively connected in what Whitehead calls a \"society\" of events. By assuming that enduring objects are the most real and fundamental things in the universe, materialists have mistaken the abstract for the concrete (what Whitehead calls the \"fallacy of misplaced concreteness\").\nTo put it another way, a thing or person is often seen as having a \"defining essence\" or a \"core identity\" that is unchanging, and describes what the thing or person \"really is\". In this way of thinking, things and people are seen as fundamentally the same through time, with any changes being qualitative and secondary to their core identity (e.g., \"Mark's hair has turned grey as he has gotten older, but he is still the same person\"). But in Whitehead's cosmology, the only fundamentally existent things are discrete \"occasions of experience\" that overlap one another in time and space, and jointly make up the enduring person or thing. On the other hand, what ordinary thinking often regards as \"the essence of a thing\" or \"the identity/core of a person\" is an abstract generalization of what is regarded as that person or thing's most important or salient features across time. Identities do not define people; people define identities. Everything changes from moment to moment and to think of anything as having an \"enduring essence\" misses the fact that \"all things flow,\" though it is often a useful way of speaking.\nWhitehead pointed to the limitations of language as one of the main culprits in maintaining a materialistic way of thinking and acknowledged that it may be difficult to ever wholly move past such ideas in everyday speech. After all, every moment of each person's life can hardly be given a different proper name, and it is easy and convenient to think of people and objects as remaining fundamentally the same things, rather than constantly keeping in mind that each thing is a different thing from what it was a moment ago. Yet the limitations of everyday living and everyday speech should not prevent people from realizing that \"material substances\" or \"essences\" are a convenient generalized description of a continuum of particular, concrete processes. No one questions that a ten-year-old person is quite different by the time he or she turns thirty years old, and in many ways is not the same person at all; Whitehead points out that it is not philosophically or ontologically sound to think that a person is the same from one second to the next.\nA second problem with materialism is that it obscures the importance of \"relations\". It sees every object as distinct and discrete from all other objects. Each object is simply an inert clump of matter that is only \"externally\" related to other things. The idea of matter as primary makes people think of objects as being fundamentally separate in time and space, and not necessarily related to anything. But in Whitehead's view, relations take a primary role, perhaps even more important than the relata themselves. A student taking notes in one of Whitehead's fall 1924 classes wrote that, \"Reality applies to \"connections\", and only relatively to the things connected. (A) is real for (B), and (B) is real for (A), but [they are] not absolutely real independent of each other.\" In fact, Whitehead describes any entity as in some sense nothing more and nothing less than the sum of its relations to other entities \u2013 its \"synthesis of\" and \"reaction to\" the world around it. A real thing is just that which forces the rest of the universe to in some way conform to it; that is to say, if theoretically, a thing made strictly no difference to any other entity (i.e., it was not \"related\" to any other entity), it could not be said to really exist. Relations are not secondary to what a thing is; they \"are\" what the thing is.\nTo Whitehead, an entity is not \"merely\" a sum of its relations, but also a valuation of them and reaction to them. For Whitehead, creativity is the absolute principle of existence, and every entity (whether it is a human being, a tree, or an electron) has some degree of novelty in how it responds to other entities and is not fully determined by causal or mechanistic laws. Most entities do not have consciousness. As a human being's actions cannot always be predicted, the same can be said of where a tree's roots will grow, or how an electron will move, or whether it will rain tomorrow. Moreover, the inability to predict an electron's movement (for instance) is not due to faulty understanding or inadequate technology; rather, the fundamental creativity/freedom of all entities means that there will always remain phenomena that are unpredictable.\nThe other side of creativity/freedom as the absolute principle is that every entity is constrained by the social structure of existence (i.e., its relations); each actual entity must conform to the settled conditions of the world around it. Freedom always exists within limits. But an entity's uniqueness and individuality arise from its own self-determination as to just how it will take account of the world within the limits that have been set for it.\nIn summary, Whitehead rejects the idea of separate and unchanging bits of matter as the most basic building blocks of reality, in favour of the idea of reality as interrelated events in the process. He conceives of reality as composed of processes of dynamic \"becoming\" rather than static \"being\", emphasizing that all physical things change and evolve and that changeless \"essences\" such as matter are mere abstractions from the interrelated events that are the final real things that make up the world.\nTheory of perception.\nSince Whitehead's metaphysics described a universe in which all entities experience, he needed a new way of describing perception that was not limited to living, self-conscious beings. The term he coined was \"prehension,\" which comes from the Latin \"prehensio\", meaning \"to seize\". The term is meant to indicate a kind of perception that can be conscious or unconscious, applying to people as well as electrons. It is also intended to make clear Whitehead's rejection of the theory of \"representative\" perception, in which the mind only has private ideas about other entities. For Whitehead, the term \"prehension\" indicates that the perceiver actually incorporates aspects of the perceived thing into itself. In this way, entities are constituted by their perceptions and relations, rather than being independent of them. Further, Whitehead regards perception as occurring in two modes, \"causal efficacy\" (or \"physical prehension\") and \"presentational immediacy\" (or \"conceptual prehension\").\nWhitehead describes causal efficacy as \"the experience dominating the primitive living organisms, which have a sense for the fate from which they have emerged, and the fate towards which they go.\" It is, in other words, the sense of causal relations between entities, a feeling of being influenced and affected by the surrounding environment, unmediated by the senses. Presentational immediacy, on the other hand, is what is usually referred to as \"pure sense perception\", unmediated by any causal or symbolic interpretation, even unconscious interpretation. In other words, it is pure appearance, which may or may not be delusive (e.g., mistaking an image in a mirror for \"the real thing\").\nIn higher organisms (like people), these two modes of perception combine into what Whitehead terms \"symbolic reference\", which links appearance with causation in a process that is so automatic that both people and animals have difficulty refraining from it. By way of illustration, Whitehead uses the example of a person's encounter with a chair. An ordinary person looks up, sees a coloured shape, and immediately infers that it is a chair. However, an artist, Whitehead supposes, \"might not have jumped to the notion of a chair\", but instead \"might have stopped at the mere contemplation of a beautiful colour and a beautiful shape.\" This is not the normal human reaction; most people place objects in categories by habit and instinct, without even thinking about it. Moreover, animals do the same thing. Using the same example, Whitehead points out that a dog \"would have acted immediately on the hypothesis of a chair and would have jumped onto it by way of using it as such.\" In this way, symbolic reference is a fusion of pure sense perceptions on the one hand and causal relations on the other, and it is in fact the causal relationships that dominate the more basic mentality (as the dog illustrates), while it is the sense perceptions which indicate a higher grade mentality (as the artist illustrates).\nEvolution and value.\nWhitehead believed that when asking questions about the basic facts of existence, questions about value and purpose can never be fully escaped. This is borne out in his thoughts on abiogenesis, or the hypothetical natural process by which life arises from simple organic compounds.\nWhitehead makes the startling observation that \"life is comparatively deficient in survival value.\" If humans can only exist for about a hundred years, and rocks for eight hundred million, then one is forced to ask why complex organisms ever evolved in the first place; as Whitehead humorously notes, \"they certainly did not appear because they were better at that game than the rocks around them.\" He then observes that the mark of higher forms of life is that they are actively engaged in modifying their environment, an activity which he theorizes is directed toward the three-fold goal of living, living well, and living better. In other words, Whitehead sees life as directed toward the purpose of increasing its own satisfaction. Without such a goal, he sees the rise of life as totally unintelligible.\nFor Whitehead, there is no such thing as wholly inert matter. Instead, all things have some measure of freedom or creativity, however small, which allows them to be at least partly self-directed. The process philosopher David Ray Griffin coined the term \"panexperientialism\" (the idea that all entities experience) to describe Whitehead's view, and to distinguish it from panpsychism (the idea that all matter has consciousness).\nGod.\nWhitehead's idea of God differs from traditional monotheistic notions. Perhaps his most famous and pointed criticism of the Christian conception of God is that \"the Church gave unto God the attributes which belonged exclusively to Caesar.\" Here, Whitehead is criticizing Christianity for defining God as primarily a divine king who imposes his will on the world, and whose most important attribute is power. As opposed to the most widely accepted forms of Christianity, Whitehead emphasized an idea of God that he called \"the brief Galilean vision of humility\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFor Whitehead, God is not necessarily tied to religion. Rather than springing primarily from religious faith, Whitehead saw God as necessary for his metaphysical system. His system required that an order exist among possibilities, an order that allowed for novelty in the world and provided an aim to all entities. Whitehead posited that these ordered potentials exist in what he called the \"primordial nature\" of God. However, Whitehead was also interested in religious experience. This led him to reflect more intensively on what he saw as the second nature of God, the \"consequent nature\". Whitehead's conception of God as a \"dipolar\" entity has called for fresh theological thinking.\nThe primordial nature he described as \"the unlimited conceptual realization of the absolute wealth of potentiality\" \u2013 i.e., the unlimited possibility of the universe. This primordial nature is eternal and unchanging, providing entities in the universe with possibilities for realization. Whitehead also calls this primordial aspect \"the lure for feeling, the eternal urge of desire,\" pulling the entities in the universe toward as-yet unrealized possibilities.\nGod's consequent nature, on the other hand, is anything but unchanging; it is God's reception of the world's activity. As Whitehead puts it, \"[God] saves the world as it passes into the immediacy of his own life. It is the judgment of a tenderness which loses nothing that can be saved.\" In other words, God saves and cherishes all experiences forever, and those experiences go on to change the way God interacts with the world. In this way, God is really changed by what happens in the world and the wider universe, lending the actions of finite creatures an eternal significance.\nWhitehead thus sees God and the world as fulfilling one another. He sees entities in the world as fluent and changing things that yearn for a permanence which only God can provide by taking them into God's self, thereafter changing God and affecting the rest of the universe throughout time. On the other hand, he sees God as permanent but as deficient in actuality and change: alone, God is merely eternally unrealized possibilities and requires the world to actualize them. God gives creatures permanence, while the creatures give God actuality and change. Here it is worthwhile to quote Whitehead at length:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"In this way God is completed by the individual, fluent satisfactions of finite fact, and the temporal occasions are completed by their everlasting union with their transformed selves, purged into conformation with the eternal order which is the final absolute 'wisdom.' The final summary can only be expressed in terms of a group of antitheses, whose apparent self-contradictions depend on neglect of the diverse categories of existence. In each antithesis there is a shift of meaning which converts the opposition into a contrast.\n\"It is as true to say that God is permanent and the World fluent, as that the World is permanent and God is fluent.\n\"It is as true to say that God is one and the World many, as that the World is one and God many.\n\"It is as true to say that, in comparison with the World, God is actual eminently, as that, in comparison with God, the World is actual eminently.\n\"It is as true to say that the World is immanent in God, as that God is immanent in the World.\n\"It is as true to say that God transcends the World, as that the World transcends God.\n\"It is as true to say that God creates the World, as that the World creates God...\n\"What is done in the world is transformed into a reality in heaven, and the reality in heaven passes back into the world... In this sense, God is the great companion \u2013 the fellow-sufferer who understands.\"\nThe above is some of Whitehead's most evocative writing about God, and was powerful enough to inspire the movement known as process theology, a vibrant theological school of thought that continues to thrive today.\nReligion.\nFor Whitehead, the core of religion was individual. While he acknowledged that individuals cannot ever be fully separated from their society, he argued that life is an internal fact for its own sake before it is an external fact relating to others. His most famous remark on religion is that \"religion is what the individual does with his own solitariness ... and if you are never solitary, you are never religious.\" Whitehead saw religion as a system of general truths that transformed a person's character. He took special care to note that while religion is often a good influence, it is not \"necessarily\" good \u2013 an idea which he called a \"dangerous delusion\" (e.g., a religion might encourage the violent extermination of a rival religion's adherents).\nHowever, while Whitehead saw religion as \"beginning\" in solitariness, he also saw religion as necessarily expanding beyond the individual. In keeping with his process metaphysics in which relations are primary, he wrote that religion necessitates the realization of \"the value of the objective world which is a community derivative from the interrelations of its component individuals.\" In other words, the universe is a community which makes itself whole through the relatedness of each individual entity to all the others; meaning and value do not exist for the individual alone, but only in the context of the universal community. Whitehead writes further that each entity \"can find no such value till it has merged its individual claim with that of the objective universe. Religion is world loyalty. The spirit at once surrenders itself to this universal claim and appropriates it for itself.\" In this way, the individual and universal/social aspects of religion are mutually dependent. \nA connection between the works of William DeWitt Hyde and Whitehead further elucidates this necessary duality of social and individual roles in religious experience.\nWhitehead also described religion more technically as \"an ultimate craving to infuse into the insistent particularity of emotion that non-temporal generality which primarily belongs to conceptual thought alone.\" In other words, religion takes deeply felt emotions and contextualizes them within a system of general truths about the world, helping people to identify their wider meaning and significance. For Whitehead, religion served as a kind of bridge between philosophy and the emotions and purposes of a particular society. It is the task of religion to make philosophy applicable to the everyday lives of ordinary people.\nInfluence.\nIsabelle Stengers wrote that \"Whiteheadians are recruited among both philosophers and theologians, and the palette has been enriched by practitioners from the most diverse horizons, from ecology to feminism, practices that unite political struggle and spirituality with the sciences of education.\" In recent decades, attention to Whitehead's work has become more widespread, with interest extending to intellectuals in Europe and China, and coming from such diverse fields as ecology, physics, biology, education, economics, and psychology. One of the first theologians to attempt to interact with Whitehead's thought was the future Archbishop of Canterbury, William Temple. In Temple's Gifford Lectures of 1932\u20131934 (subsequently published as \"Nature, Man and God\"), Whitehead is one of a number of philosophers of the emergent evolution approach with which Temple interacts. However, it was not until the 1970s and 1980s that Whitehead's thought drew much attention outside of a small group of philosophers and theologians, primarily Americans, and even today he is not considered especially influential outside of relatively specialized circles.\nEarly followers of Whitehead were found primarily at the University of Chicago Divinity School, where Henry Nelson Wieman initiated an interest in Whitehead's work that would last for about thirty years. Professors such as Wieman, Charles Hartshorne, Bernard Loomer, Bernard Meland, and Daniel Day Williams made Whitehead's philosophy arguably the most important intellectual thread running through the divinity school. They taught generations of Whitehead scholars, the most notable of whom is John B. Cobb.\nAlthough interest in Whitehead has since faded at Chicago's divinity school, Cobb effectively grabbed the torch and planted it firmly in Claremont, California, where he began teaching at Claremont School of Theology in 1958 and founded the Center for Process Studies with David Ray Griffin in 1973. Largely due to Cobb's influence, today Claremont remains strongly identified with Whitehead's process thought.\nBut while Claremont remains the most concentrated hub of Whiteheadian activity, the place where Whitehead's thought currently seems to be growing the most quickly is in China. In order to address the challenges of modernization and industrialization, China has begun to blend traditions of Taoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism with Whitehead's \"constructive post-modern\" philosophy in order to create an \"ecological civilization\". To date, the Chinese government has encouraged the building of twenty-three university-based centres for the study of Whitehead's philosophy, and books by process philosophers John Cobb and David Ray Griffin are becoming required reading for Chinese graduate students. Cobb has attributed China's interest in process philosophy partly to Whitehead's stress on the mutual interdependence of humanity and nature, as well as his emphasis on an educational system that includes the teaching of values rather than simply bare facts.\nOverall, however, Whitehead's influence is very difficult to characterize. In English-speaking countries, his primary works are little-studied outside of Claremont and a select number of liberal graduate-level theology and philosophy programs. Outside of these circles, his influence is relatively small and diffuse and has tended to come chiefly through the work of his students and admirers rather than Whitehead himself. For instance, Whitehead was a teacher and long-time friend and collaborator of Bertrand Russell, and he also taught and supervised the dissertation of Willard Van Orman Quine, both of whom are important figures in analytic philosophy \u2013 the dominant strain of philosophy in English-speaking countries in the 20th century. Whitehead has also had high-profile admirers in the continental tradition, such as French post-structuralist philosopher Gilles Deleuze, who once dryly remarked of Whitehead that \"he stands provisionally as the last great Anglo-American philosopher before Wittgenstein's disciples spread their misty confusion, sufficiency, and terror.\" French sociologist and anthropologist Bruno Latour even went so far as to call Whitehead \"the greatest philosopher of the 20th century.\"\nDeleuze's and Latour's opinions, however, are minority ones, as Whitehead has not been recognized as particularly influential within the most dominant philosophical schools. It is impossible to say exactly why Whitehead's influence has not been more widespread, but it may be partly due to his metaphysical ideas seeming somewhat counterintuitive (such as his assertion that matter is an abstraction), or his inclusion of theistic elements in his philosophy, or the perception of metaphysics itself as pass\u00e9, or simply the sheer difficulty and density of his prose.\nProcess philosophy and theology.\nHistorically, Whitehead's work has been most influential in the field of American progressive theology. The most important early proponent of Whitehead's thought in a theological context was Charles Hartshorne, who spent a semester at Harvard as Whitehead's teaching assistant in 1925, and is widely credited with developing Whitehead's process philosophy into a full-blown process theology. Other notable process theologians include John B. Cobb, David Ray Griffin, Marjorie Hewitt Suchocki, C. Robert Mesle, Roland Faber, and Catherine Keller.\nProcess theology typically stresses God's relational nature. Rather than seeing God as impassive or emotionless, process theologians view God as \"the fellow sufferer who understands,\" and as the being who is supremely affected by temporal events. Hartshorne points out that people would not praise a human ruler who was unaffected by either the joys or sorrows of his followers \u2013 so why would this be a praiseworthy quality in God? Instead, as the being who is most affected by the world, God is the being who can most appropriately respond to the world. However, process theology has been formulated in a wide variety of ways. C. Robert Mesle, for instance, advocates a \"process naturalism\" \u2013 i.e., a process theology without God.\nIn fact, process theology is difficult to define because process theologians are so diverse and transdisciplinary in their views and interests. John B. Cobb is a process theologian who has also written books on biology and economics. Roland Faber and Catherine Keller integrate Whitehead with poststructuralist, postcolonialist, and feminist theory. Charles Birch was both a theologian and a geneticist. Franklin I. Gamwell writes on theology and political theory. In \"Syntheism \u2013 Creating God in The Internet Age\", futurologists Alexander Bard and Jan S\u00f6derqvist repeatedly credit Whitehead for the process theology they see rising out of the participatory culture expected to dominate the digital era.\nProcess philosophy is even more difficult to pin down than process theology. In practice, the two fields cannot be neatly separated. The 32-volume State University of New York series in constructive postmodern thought edited by process philosopher and theologian David Ray Griffin displays the range of areas in which different process philosophers work, including physics, ecology, medicine, public policy, nonviolence, politics, and psychology.\nOne philosophical school which has historically had a close relationship with process philosophy is American pragmatism. Whitehead himself thought highly of William James and John Dewey, and acknowledged his indebtedness to them in the preface to \"Process and Reality\". Charles Hartshorne (along with Paul Weiss) edited the collected papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, one of the founders of pragmatism. Noted neopragmatist Richard Rorty was in turn a student of Hartshorne.\nScience.\nScientists of the early 20th century for whom Whitehead's work has been influential include physical chemist Ilya Prigogine, biologist Conrad Hal Waddington, and geneticists Charles Birch and Sewall Wright.\nHenry Murray dedicated his \"Explorations in Personality\" to Whitehead, a contemporary at Harvard.\nIn physics, Whitehead's theory of gravitation articulated a view that might perhaps be regarded as dual to Albert Einstein's general relativity. It has been severely criticized. Yutaka Tanaka suggested that the gravitational constant disagrees with experimental findings, and proposed that Einstein's work does not actually refute Whitehead's formulation. Whitehead's view has now been rendered obsolete, with the discovery of gravitational waves, phenomena observed locally that largely violate the kind of local flatness of space that Whitehead assumes. Consequently, Whitehead's cosmology must be regarded as a local approximation, and his assumption of a uniform spatio-temporal geometry, Minkowskian in particular, as an often-locally-adequate approximation. An exact replacement of Whitehead's cosmology would need to admit a Riemannian geometry. Also, although Whitehead himself gave only secondary consideration to quantum theory, his metaphysics of processes has proved attractive to some physicists in that field. Henry Stapp and David Bohm are among those whose work has been influenced by Whitehead.\nIn the 21st century, Whiteheadian thought is still a stimulating influence: Timothy E. Eastman and Hank Keeton's \"Physics and Whitehead\" (2004) and Michael Epperson's \"Quantum Mechanics and the Philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead\" (2004) and \"Foundations of Relational Realism: A Topological Approach to Quantum Mechanics and the Philosophy of Nature\" (2013), aim to offer Whiteheadian approaches to physics. Brian G. Henning, Adam Scarfe, and Dorion Sagan's \"Beyond Mechanism\" (2013) and Rupert Sheldrake's \"Science Set Free\" (2012) are examples of Whiteheadian approaches to biology.\nEcology, economy, and sustainability.\nOne of the most promising applications of Whitehead's thought in recent years has been in the area of ecological civilization, sustainability, and environmental ethics.\n\"Because Whitehead's holistic metaphysics of value lends itself so readily to an ecological point of view, many see his work as a promising alternative to the traditional mechanistic worldview, providing a detailed metaphysical picture of a world constituted by a web of interdependent relations.\"\nThis work has been pioneered by John B. Cobb, whose book \"Is It Too Late? A Theology of Ecology\" (1971) was the first single-authored book on environmental ethics. Cobb also co-authored a book with leading ecological economist and steady-state theorist Herman Daly entitled \"For the Common Good: Redirecting the Economy toward Community, the Environment, and a Sustainable Future\" (1989), which applied Whitehead's thought to economics, and received the Grawemeyer Award for Ideas Improving World Order. Cobb followed this with a second book, \"Sustaining the Common Good: A Christian Perspective on the Global Economy\" (1994), which aimed to challenge \"economists' zealous faith in the great god of growth.\"\nEducation.\nWhitehead is widely known for his influence in education theory. His philosophy inspired the formation of the Association for Process Philosophy of Education (APPE), which published eleven volumes of a journal titled \"Process Papers\" on process philosophy and education from 1996 to 2008. Whitehead's theories on education also led to the formation of new modes of learning and new models of teaching.\nOne such model is the ANISA model developed by Daniel C. Jordan, which sought to address a lack of understanding of the nature of people in current education systems. As Jordan and Raymond P. Shepard put it: \"Because it has not defined the nature of man, education is in the untenable position of having to devote its energies to the development of curricula without any coherent ideas about the nature of the creature for whom they are intended.\"\nAnother model is the FEELS model developed by Xie Bangxiu and deployed successfully in China. \"FEELS\" stands for five things in curriculum and education: Flexible-goals, Engaged-learner, Embodied-knowledge, Learning-through-interactions, and Supportive-teacher. It is used for understanding and evaluating educational curriculum under the assumption that the purpose of education is to \"help a person become whole.\" This work is in part the product of cooperation between Chinese government organizations and the Institute for the Postmodern Development of China.\nWhitehead's philosophy of education has also found institutional support in Canada, where the University of Saskatchewan created a Process Philosophy Research Unit and sponsored several conferences on process philosophy and education. Howard Woodhouse at the University of Saskatchewan remains a strong proponent of Whiteheadian education.\nThree recent books which further develop Whitehead's philosophy of education include: \"Modes of Learning: Whitehead's Metaphysics and the Stages of Education\" (2012) by George Allan; \"The Adventure of Education: Process Philosophers on Learning, Teaching, and Research\" (2009) by Adam Scarfe; and \"Educating for an Ecological Civilization: Interdisciplinary, Experiential, and Relational Learning\" (2017) edited by Marcus Ford and Stephen Rowe. \"Beyond the Modern University: Toward a Constructive Postmodern University,\" (2002) is another text that explores the importance of Whitehead's metaphysics for thinking about higher education.\nBusiness administration.\nWhitehead has had some influence on the philosophy of business administration and organizational theory. This has led in part to a focus on identifying and investigating the effect of temporal events (as opposed to static things) within organizations through an \"organization studies\" discourse that accommodates a variety of 'weak' and 'strong' process perspectives from a number of philosophers. One of the leading figures having an explicitly Whiteheadian and panexperientialist stance towards management is Mark Dibben, who works in what he calls \"applied process thought\" to articulate a philosophy of management and business administration as part of a wider examination of the social sciences through the lens of process metaphysics. For Dibben, this allows \"a comprehensive exploration of life as perpetually active experiencing, as opposed to occasional \u2013 and thoroughly passive \u2013 happening.\" Dibben has published two books on applied process thought, \"https://\" (2008), and \"https://\" (2009), as well as other papers in this vein in the fields of philosophy of management and business ethics.\nMargaret Stout and Carrie M. Staton have also written recently on the mutual influence of Whitehead and Mary Parker Follett, a pioneer in the fields of organizational theory and organizational behaviour. Stout and Staton see both Whitehead and Follett as sharing an ontology that \"understands becoming as a relational process; difference as being related, yet unique; and the purpose of becoming as harmonizing difference.\" This connection is further analyzed by Stout and Jeannine M. Love in \"Integrative Process: Follettian Thinking from Ontology to Administration\".\nPolitical views.\nWhitehead's political views sometimes appear to be libertarian without the label. He wrote:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Now the intercourse between individuals and between social groups takes one of two forms, force or persuasion. Commerce is the great example of intercourse by way of persuasion. War, slavery, and governmental compulsion exemplify the reign of force.\nOn the other hand, many Whitehead scholars read his work as providing a philosophical foundation for the social liberalism of the New Liberal movement that was prominent throughout Whitehead's adult life. Morris wrote that \"... there is good reason for claiming that Whitehead shared the social and political ideals of the new liberals.\". However, Whitehead's comment addresses means and methods, not \"ideals\" or pretexts or excuses.\nPrimary works.\nBooks written by Whitehead, listed by date of publication.\nIn addition, the Whitehead Research Project of the Center for Process Studies is currently working on a critical edition of Whitehead's writings, which is set to include notes taken by Whitehead's students during his Harvard classes, correspondence, and corrected editions of his books.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n\"For the most comprehensive list of resources related to Whitehead, see the http:// of the http://.\""}
