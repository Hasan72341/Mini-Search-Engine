It provides that state courts are bound by the supreme law; in case of conflict between federal and state law, the federal law must be applied. Even state constitutions are subordinate to federal law.\nThe Supreme Court under John Marshall (the Marshall Court) was influential in construing the supremacy clause. It first ruled that it had the power to review the decisions of state courts allegedly in conflict with the supreme law, claims of \"state sovereignty\" notwithstanding. In \"Martin v. Hunter's Lessee\" (1816), the Supreme Court confronted the Chief Justice of Virginia, Spencer Roane, who had previously declared a Supreme Court decision unconstitutional and refused to permit the state courts to abide by it. The Court upheld the Judiciary Act, which permitted it to hear appeals from state courts, on the grounds that Congress had passed it under the supremacy clause.\nThe Supreme Court has also struck down attempts by states to control or direct the affairs of federal institutions. \"McCulloch v. Maryland\" (1819) was a significant case in this regard. The state of Maryland had levied a tax on banks not chartered by the state; the tax applied, state judges ruled, to the Bank of the United States chartered by Congress in 1816. Marshall wrote that \"the States have no power, by taxation or otherwise, to retard, impede, burden, or in any manner control, the operations of the constitutional laws enacted by Congress to carry into execution the powers vested in the general government.\" United States property is wholly immune to state taxation, as are government activities and institutions. Congress may explicitly provide immunity from taxation in certain cases, for instance by immunizing a federal contractor. Federal employees, however, may not be immunized from taxes, as the tax would not in any way impede government activities.\n\"Gibbons v. Ogden\" (1824) was another influential case involving the supremacy clause. The state of New York had granted Aaron Ogden a monopoly over the steamboat business in the Hudson River. The other party, Thomas Gibbons, had obtained a federal permit under the Coastal Licensing Act to perform the same task. The Supreme Court upheld the federal permit. John Marshall wrote, \"The nullity of an act, inconsistent with the Constitution, is produced by the declaration, that the Constitution is the supreme law. The appropriate application of that part of the clause which confers the same supremacy on laws and treaties, is to such acts of the State legislatures as do not transcend their powers, but though enacted in the execution of acknowledged State powers, interfere with, or are contrary to the laws of Congress, made in pursuance of the Constitution, or some treaty made under the authority of the United States. In every such case, the act of Congress, or the treaty, is supreme; and the law of the State, though enacted in the exercise of powers not controverted, must yield to it.\"\n\"Reid v. Covert\" (1957) ruled that no branch of the United States Government can have powers conferred upon it by treaty that have not been conferred by the United States Constitution.\nOaths.\nFederal and state legislators, executive officers and judges are, by the third clause of the article, bound by oath or affirmation to support the Constitution. Congress may determine the form of such an oath. In \"Ex parte Garland\" (1866), the Supreme Court held that a test oath would violate the Constitution, so it invalidated the law requiring the following oath:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I, A. B., do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I have never voluntarily borne arms against the United States since I have been a citizen thereof; that I have voluntarily given no aid, countenance, counsel, or encouragement to persons engaged in armed hostility thereto; that I have neither sought nor accepted, not attempted to exercise the functions of any office whatever, under any authority or pretended authority in hostility to the United States; that I have not yielded a voluntary support to any pretended government, authority, power, or constitution with the United States, hostile or inimical thereto...\nThe Supreme Court found that the law constituted an unconstitutional \"ex post facto\" law, for it retroactively punished the offenses mentioned in the oath by preventing those who committed them from taking office.\nCongress may not require religious tests for an office under the United States. Thus, Congress may include the customary words \"so help me God\" in an oath, but an individual would be under no compulsion to utter them, as such a requirement would constitute a religious test.\nThe current oath administered is as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I, [name], do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. [So help me God.]\nDuring the 1960 presidential campaign, the issue of whether the nation would for the first time elect a Catholic to the highest office in the land raised the specter of an implicit, but no less effective, religious test. John F. Kennedy, in his on 12 September 1960, addressed the question directly, saying,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[N]either do I look with favor upon those who would work to subvert Article VI of the Constitution by requiring a religious test, even by indirection. For if they disagree with that safeguard, they should be openly working to repeal it.\n... [C]ontrary to common newspaper usage, I am not the Catholic candidate for President.\nI am the Democratic Party's candidate for President who happens also to be a Catholic.\nI do not speak for my church on public matters; and the church does not speak for me. Whatever issue may come before me as President, if I should be elected, on birth control, divorce, censorship, gambling or any other subject, I will make my decision in accordance with these views \u2013 in accordance with what my conscience tells me to be in the national interest, and without regard to outside religious pressure or dictates. And no power or threat of punishment could cause me to decide otherwise.\nBut if the time should ever come \u2013 and I do not concede any conflict to be remotely possible \u2013 when my office would require me to either violate my conscience or violate the national interest, then I would resign the office; and I hope any other conscientious public servant would do likewise.\nBut I do not intend to apologize for these views to my critics of either Catholic or Protestant faith; nor do I intend to disavow either my views or my church in order to win this election.\nIf I should lose on the real issues, I shall return to my seat in the Senate, satisfied that I'd tried my best and was fairly judged.\nBut if this election is decided on the basis that 40 million Americans lost their chance of being President on the day they were baptized, then it is the whole nation that will be the loser, in the eyes of Catholics and non-Catholics around the world, in the eyes of history, and in the eyes of our own people.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "31653", "revid": "47971992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31653", "title": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution", "text": "1791 amendment limiting government restriction of civil liberties\nThe First Amendment (Amendment I) to the United States Constitution prevents Congress from making laws respecting an establishment of religion; prohibiting the free exercise of religion; or abridging the freedom of speech, the freedom of the press, the freedom of assembly, or the right to petition the government for redress of grievances. It was adopted on December 15, 1791, as one of the ten amendments that constitute the Bill of Rights. In the original draft of the Bill of Rights, what is now the First Amendment occupied third place. The first two articles were not ratified by the states, so the article on disestablishment and free speech ended up being first.\nThe Bill of Rights was proposed to assuage Anti-Federalist opposition to Constitutional ratification. Initially, the First Amendment applied only to laws enacted by the Congress, and many of its provisions were interpreted more narrowly than they are today. Beginning with \"Gitlow v. New York\" (1925), the Supreme Court applied the First Amendment to states\u2014a process known as incorporation\u2014through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The First Amendment applies only to state actors.\nWith regard to religious freedom, the Court has frequently cited Thomas Jefferson's call for \"a wall of separation between church and State\", a metaphor for the separation of religions from government and vice versa as well as the free exercise of religious beliefs that many Founders favored. Speech rights were expanded significantly in a series of 20th- and 21st-century court decisions which protected various forms of political speech, anonymous speech, campaign finance, pornography, and school speech; these rulings also defined a series of exceptions to First Amendment protections.\nThe Free Press Clause protects publication of information and opinions, and applies to a wide variety of media. In \"Near v. Minnesota\" (1931) and \"New York Times Co. v. United States\" (1971), the Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment protected against prior restraint\u2014pre-publication censorship\u2014in almost all cases. The Petition Clause protects the right to petition all branches and agencies of government for action. In addition to the right of assembly guaranteed by this clause, the Court has also ruled that the amendment implicitly protects freedom of association.\nText.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\nBackground.\nThe right to petition for redress of grievances was a principle included in the 1215 Magna Carta, as well as the 1689 English Bill of Rights. In 1776, the second year of the American Revolutionary War, the Virginia colonial legislature passed a Declaration of Rights that included the sentence \"The freedom of the press is one of the greatest bulwarks of liberty, and can never be restrained but by despotic Governments.\" Eight of the other twelve states made similar pledges. However, these declarations were generally considered \"mere admonitions to state legislatures\", rather than enforceable provisions.\nAfter several years of comparatively weak government under the Articles of Confederation, a Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia proposed a new constitution on September 17, 1787, featuring among other changes a stronger chief executive. George Mason, a Constitutional Convention delegate and the drafter of Virginia's Declaration of Rights, proposed that the Constitution include a bill of rights listing and guaranteeing civil liberties. Other delegates\u2014including future Bill of Rights drafter James Madison\u2014disagreed, arguing that existing state guarantees of civil liberties were sufficient and any attempt to enumerate individual rights risked the implication that other, unnamed rights were unprotected. After a brief debate, Mason's proposal was defeated by a unanimous vote of the state delegations.For the constitution to be ratified, however, nine of the thirteen states were required to approve it in state conventions. Opposition to ratification (\"Anti-Federalism\") was partly based on the Constitution's lack of adequate guarantees for civil liberties. Supporters of the Constitution in states where popular sentiment was against ratification (including Virginia, Massachusetts, and New York) successfully proposed that their state conventions both ratify the Constitution and call for the addition of a bill of rights. The U.S. Constitution was eventually ratified by all thirteen states. In the 1st United States Congress, following the state legislatures' request, James Madison proposed twenty constitutional amendments, and his proposed draft of the First Amendment read as follows:\nThe civil rights of none shall be abridged on account of religious belief or worship, nor shall any national religion be established, nor shall the full and equal rights of conscience be in any manner, or on any pretext, infringed. The people shall not be deprived or abridged of their right to speak, to write, or to publish their sentiments; and the freedom of the press, as one of the great bulwarks of liberty, shall be inviolable. The people shall not be restrained from peaceably assembling and consulting for their common good; nor from applying to the Legislature by petitions, or remonstrances, for redress of their grievances.\nThis language was greatly condensed by Congress, and passed the House and Senate with almost no recorded debate, complicating future discussion of the Amendment's intent. Congress approved and submitted to the states for their ratification twelve articles of amendment on September 25, 1789. The revised text of the third article became the First Amendment, because the last ten articles of the submitted 12 articles were ratified by the requisite number of states on December 15, 1791, and are now known collectively as the Bill of Rights.\nFreedom of religion.\nReligious liberty, also known as freedom of religion, is \"the right of all persons to believe, speak, and act \u2013 individually and in community with others, in private and in public \u2013 in accord with their understanding of ultimate truth.\" The acknowledgement of religious freedom as the first right protected in the Bill of Rights points toward the American founders' understanding of the importance of religion to human, social, and political flourishing. Freedom of religion is protected by the First Amendment through its Establishment Clause and Free Exercise Clause, which together form the religious liberty clauses of the First Amendment. \nThe first clause prohibits any governmental \"establishment of religion\" and the second prohibits any governmental interference with \"the free exercise thereof.\" These clauses of the First Amendment encompass \"the two big arenas of religion in constitutional law. Establishment cases deal with the Constitution's ban on Congress endorsing, promoting or becoming too involved with religion. Free exercise cases deal with Americans' rights to practice their faith.\" Both clauses sometimes compete with each other. The Supreme Court in \"McCreary County v. American Civil Liberties Union\" (2005) clarified this by the following example: When the government spends money on the clergy, then it looks like establishing religion, but if the government cannot pay for military chaplains, then many soldiers and sailors would be kept from the opportunity to exercise their chosen religions. The Supreme Court developed the preferred position doctrine. In \"Murdock v. Pennsylvania\" (1943) the Supreme Court stated: \"Freedom of press, freedom of speech, freedom of religion are in a preferred position,\" adding that \"[plainly], a community may not suppress, or the state tax, the dissemination of views because they are unpopular, annoying or distasteful.\"\nThe First Amendment tolerates neither governmentally established religion nor governmental interference with religion. One of the central purposes of the First Amendment, the Supreme Court wrote in \"Gillette v. United States\" (1970), consists \"of ensuring governmental neutrality in matters of religion.\" In \"Wallace v. Jaffree\" regarding silent school prayer, it was maintained that the central liberty that unifies the various clauses in the First Amendment is the individual's freedom of conscience. In \"Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition\" (2002), the Court stated: First Amendment freedoms are most in danger when the government seeks to control thought or to justify its laws for that impermissible end. The right to think is the beginning of freedom, and speech must be protected from the government because speech is the beginning of thought.\nEstablishment of religion.\nThe Establishment Clause forbids federal, state, and local laws whose purpose is \"an establishment of religion.\" The term \"establishment\" denoted in general direct aid to the church by the government. In \"Larkin v. Grendel's Den, Inc.\" (1982), the Supreme Court stated that \"the core rationale underlying the Establishment Clause is preventing \"a fusion of governmental and religious functions.\" The Establishment Clause acts as a double security, for it both bars religious control over government and political control over religion. This is reflected in \"Reynolds v. United States\" (1878), in which the Supreme Court declared that Congress could not legislate over religious opinion except to curtail that which imperils \"peace and good order.\" \nOriginally, the First Amendment applied only to the federal government, and some states continued official state religions after ratification. However, in \"Everson v. Board of Education\" (1947), the Supreme Court incorporated the Establishment Clause (i.e., made it apply against the states). The First Amendment's framers knew that intertwining government with religion could lead to bloodshed or oppression, because this happened too often historically. To prevent this dangerous development, they set up the Establishment Clause as a line of demarcation between the functions and operations of the institutions of religion and government in society. At the core of the Establishment Clause lays the principle of denominational neutrality. The clearest command of the Establishment Clause is, according to the Supreme Court in \"Larson v. Valente\" (1982) that one religious denomination cannot be officially preferred over another. \nWhile its meaning is not clarified in the Constitution, the Establishment Clause is often understood as mandating the separation of church and state. The founder of Rhode Island Roger Williams coined the metaphor, and Thomas Jefferson famously used it in an 1802 letter to the Danbury Baptists: \"[I believe] with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man &amp; his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, [and] that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, and not opinions, ... thus building a wall of separation between Church &amp; State.\" This metaphor was introduced as a judicial doctrine in \"Everson\",146 and to this day, it defines discussion on the Establishment Clause. \nThe First Amendment's prohibition on an establishment of religion includes many things from prayer in widely varying government settings over financial aid for religious individuals and institutions to comment on religious questions. However, its precise meaning is heavily debated. The National Constitution Center observes that, absent some common interpretations by jurists, the precise meaning of the Establishment Clause is unclear and that decisions by the Supreme Court relating to the Establishment Clause often are by 5\u20134 votes. One such controversial decision was taken in \"Engel v. Vitale\" (1962), which held it unconstitutional for public schools to organize prayer or Bible reading sessions for students, even if on a voluntary basis.The predominant means by which the Court has enforced the Establishment Clause is the Lemon test, founded in the case \"Lemon v. Kurtzman\" (1971). It determined whether an action is an establishment if: a) the statute (or practice) lacked a secular purpose; b) its principal or primary effect advanced or inhibited religion; or c) it fostered excessive government entanglement with religion. After the Supreme Court ruling in the coach praying case of \"Kennedy v. Bremerton School District\" (2022), the Lemon Test may have been replaced or complemented with a reference to historical practices and understandings.\nThe opponents of those who firmly subscribe to the separation of church and state: separationists, are accommodationists. They argue, along with Justice William O. Douglas, that \"[w]e are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being.\" Chief Justice Warren E. Burger coined the term \"benevolent neutrality\" as a combination of neutrality and accommodationism to characterize a way to ensure that the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause do not contradict each other. Burger's successor, William Rehnquist, called for the abandonment of the \"wall of separation between church and State\" metaphor in \"Wallace v. Jaffree\" (1985), because he believed this metaphor was based on bad history and proved itself useless as a guide to judging. For many conservatives, the Establishment Clause solely prevents the government from promoting a religious sect or setting up a national church but not from \"developing policies that encourage general religious beliefs.\" In \"Lynch v. Donnelly\" (1984), the Supreme Court observed that the \"Constitution does not require complete separation of church and state; it affirmatively mandates accommodation, not merely tolerance, of all religions, and forbids hostility toward any.\"\nFree exercise of religion.\nThe acknowledgement of religious freedom as the first right protected in the Bill of Rights points toward the American founders' understanding of the importance of religion to human, social, and political flourishing. The First Amendment makes clear that it sought to protect \"the free exercise\" of religion, or what might be called \"free exercise equality.\" Free exercise is the liberty of persons to reach, hold, practice and change beliefs freely according to the dictates of conscience. The Free Exercise Clause prohibits governmental interference with religious belief and, within limits, religious practice. \"Freedom of religion means freedom to hold an opinion or belief, but not to take action in violation of social duties or subversive to good order.\" The clause withdraws from legislative power, state and federal, the exertion of any restraint on the free exercise of religion. Its purpose is to secure religious liberty in the individual by prohibiting any invasions thereof by civil authority. In \"Cantwell v. Connecticut\" (1940), the Court held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applied the Free Exercise Clause to the states. \nThe Court further explained in \"Employment Division v. Smith\" (1990) that \"the 'exercise of religion' often involves not only belief and profession but the performance of (or abstention from) physical acts: assembling with others for a worship service, participating in sacramental use of bread and wine, proselytizing, abstaining from certain foods or certain modes of transportation.\" Judge Learned Hand said in the 1953 case \"Otten v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co.\": \"The First Amendment ... gives no one the right to insist that, in pursuit of their own interests others must conform their conduct to his own religious necessities.\"\nThe Free Exercise Clause offers a double protection, for it is a shield not only against outright prohibitions with respect to the free exercise of religion but also against penalties on the free exercise of religion and against indirect governmental coercion. The Supreme Court stated in \"Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer\" (2017) that religious observers are protected against unequal treatment by virtue of the Free Exercise Clause and laws which target the religious for \"special disabilities\" based on their \"religious status\" must be covered by the application of strict scrutiny.\nThe Court first fully addressed the Free Exercise Clause's meaning in \"Reynolds v. United States\" (1879), which concerned the legality of polygamy in the U.S. the Supreme Court found that while laws cannot interfere with religious belief and opinions, laws can regulate religious practices like polygamy and human sacrifice. While the right to have religious beliefs is absolute, the freedom to act on such beliefs is not absolute. Such an interpretation was largely abandoned in \"Sherbert v. Verner\" (1963). Here, the Court required states required states to meet the \"strict scrutiny\" standard when refusing to accommodate religiously motivated conduct. In \"Employment Division\", however, the Court reaffirmed \"Reynolds\" as it held that two counsellors could be dismissed for using a drug common in Native American religious worship without violating the Free Exercise Clause.\n\"Employment Division v. Smith\" set the precedent \"that laws affecting certain religious practices do not violate the right to free exercise of religion as long as the laws are neutral, generally applicable, and not motivated by animus to religion.\"\nTo accept any creed or the practice of any form of worship cannot be compelled by laws, because, as stated by the Supreme Court in \"Braunfeld v. Brown\" (1961), the freedom to hold religious beliefs and opinions is absolute. \nIn some cases, the Establishment Clause and Free Exercise Clause collide with each other, as enforced separation of church and state ends up discriminating against religious groups. For example, \"Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School District\" (1993), the Court ruled that Center Moriches school board could not bar a Christian group from using school facilities after hours, even though the board claimed that such use would constitute the establishment of a religion.\nFreedom of speech.\nThe First Amendment broadly protects the rights of free speech and free press. Free speech means the free and public expression of opinions without censorship, interference, or restraint by the government. The term \"freedom of speech\" embedded in the First Amendment encompasses the decision what to say as well as what not to say. The speech covered by the First Amendment covers many ways of expression and therefore protects what people say as well as how they express themselves. Free press means the right of individuals to express themselves through publication and dissemination of information, ideas, and opinions without interference, constraint, or prosecution by the government. In \"Murdock v. Pennsylvania\" (1943), the Supreme Court stated that \"Freedom of press, freedom of speech, freedom of religion are in a preferred position.\" The Court added that a community may not suppress, or the state tax, the dissemination of views because they are unpopular, annoying, or distasteful. The Constitution protects, according to the Supreme Court in \"Stanley v. Georgia\" (1969), the right to receive information and ideas, regardless of their social worth, and to be generally free from governmental intrusions into one's privacy and control of one's thoughts. As stated by the Court in \"Stanley\": \"If the First Amendment means anything, it means that a State has no business telling a man, sitting alone in his own house, what books he may read or what films he may watch. Our whole constitutional heritage rebels at the thought of giving government the power to control men's minds.\"\nDespite the common misconception that the First Amendment prohibits anyone from limiting free speech, the text of the amendment prohibits only the federal government, the states, and local governments from doing so. State constitutions provide free speech protections similar to those of the U.S. Constitution. In a few states, such as California, a state constitution has been interpreted as providing more comprehensive protections than the First Amendment. The Supreme Court has permitted states to extend such enhanced protections, most notably in \"Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robins\".\nThe Supreme Court of the United States characterized the rights of free speech and free press as fundamental personal rights and liberties and noted that the exercise of these rights lies at the foundation of free government by free men. The Supreme Court stated in \"Thornhill v. Alabama\" (1940) that the freedom of speech and of the press guaranteed by the United States Constitution embraces at the least the liberty to discuss publicly and truthfully all matters of public concern, without previous restraint or fear of subsequent punishment. The Court noted in \"Bridges v. California\" (1941): \"The ability to publicly criticize even the most prominent politicians and leaders without fear of retaliation is part of the First Amendment, because political speech is core First Amendment speech. ... For it is a prized American privilege to speak one's mind, although not always with perfect good taste, on all public institutions.\" In \"Bond v. Floyd\" (1966), a case involving the Constitutional shield around the speech of elected officials, the Supreme Court declared that the First Amendment central commitment is that, in the words of \"New York Times Co. v. Sullivan\" (1964), \"debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open\". The Court further explained that just as erroneous statements must be protected to give freedom of expression the breathing space it needs to survive, so statements criticizing public policy and the implementation of it must be similarly protected:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe level of protections with respect to free speech given by the First Amendment is not limitless. As stated in his concurrence in \"Mosley\", Chief Justice Warren E. Burger said: \"the First Amendment does not literally mean that we 'are guaranteed the right to express any thought, free from government censorship.'\"\nAttached to the core rights of free speech and free press are several peripheral rights that make these core rights more secure. The peripheral rights encompass not only freedom of association, including privacy in one's associations, but also, in the words of \"Griswold v. Connecticut\" (1965), \"the freedom of the entire university community\", i.e., the right to distribute, the right to receive, and the right to read, as well as freedom of inquiry, freedom of thought, and freedom to teach. \nWording of the clause.\nThe First Amendment bars Congress from \"abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.\" U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens commented about this phraseology in a 1993 journal article: \"I emphasize the word 'the' in the term 'the freedom of speech' because the definite article suggests that the draftsmen intended to immunize a previously identified category or subset of speech.\" Stevens said that, otherwise, the clause might absurdly immunize things like false testimony under oath. Like Stevens, journalist Anthony Lewis wrote: \"The word 'the' can be read to mean what was understood at the time to be included in the concept of free speech.\" But what was understood at the time is not entirely clear. In the late 1790s, the lead author of the speech and press clauses, James Madison, argued against narrowing this freedom to what had existed under English common law: \"The practice in America must be entitled to much more respect. In every state, probably, in the Union, the press has exerted a freedom in canvassing the merits and measures of public men, of every description, which has not been confined to the strict limits of the common law.\"\nMadison wrote this in 1799, when he was in a dispute about the constitutionality of the Alien and Sedition Laws, which was legislation enacted in 1798 by President John Adams's Federalist Party to ban seditious libel. Madison believed that legislation to be unconstitutional, and his adversaries in that dispute, such as John Marshall, advocated the narrow freedom of speech that had existed in the English common law.\nHistorical outlook.\nThe Supreme Court declined to rule on the constitutionality of any federal law regarding the Free Speech Clause until the twentieth century and tended to overlook free speech protection. For example, the Court never ruled on the Alien and Sedition Acts; three Supreme Court justices riding circuit presided over sedition trials without indicating any reservations. The leading critics of the law, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, argued for the Acts' unconstitutionality based on the First Amendment and other Constitutional provisions. Punishment for blasphemy was affirmed throughout the nineteenth century.\nDuring the patriotic fervor of World War I and the Red Scare, the Court sought to restrict speech seen as promoting crime. In one such case, Socialist Party of America official Charles Schenck was convicted under the Espionage Act of 1917 for publishing leaflets urging resistance to the draft. Schenck appealed, arguing that the Espionage Act violated the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. In \"Schenck v. United States\", the Supreme Court unanimously rejected Schenck's appeal and affirmed his conviction. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. explained that \"the question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent.\"\nHowever, this trend changed in the 1920s, as the Court began interpreting the First Amendment more broadly. In \"Gitlow v. New York\" (1925), the Court upheld the conviction of Benjamin Gitlow, who had been convicted after distributing a manifesto calling for a \"revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat.\" At the same time, a majority found that the First Amendment applied to state laws as well as federal laws, the first time the Court formally accepted this view. Free speech cases thereafter would generally concern state suppression. In \"Whitney v. California\" (1927), Justice Louis Brandeis wrote a dissent in which he argued for broader protections for political speech: \"Those who won our independence... believed that freedom to think as you will and to speak as you think are means indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth; ... that public discussion is a political duty; and that this should be a fundamental principle of the American government.\"\nIn \"Herndon v. Lowry\" (1937), the Court heard the case of African American Communist Party organizer Angelo Herndon, who had been convicted under the Slave Insurrection Statute for advocating black rule in the southern United States. The Court reversed Herndon's conviction, holding that Georgia had failed to demonstrate any \"clear and present danger\" in Herndon's political advocacy. The importance of freedom of speech in the context of \"clear and present danger\" was emphasized in \"Terminiello v. City of Chicago\" (1949), where Justice William O. Douglas wrote for the Court that \"a function of free speech under our system is to invite dispute. It may indeed best serve its high purpose when it induces a condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions as they are, or even stirs people to anger.\"\nFollowing \"Thornhill v. Alabama\" (1940), the Court refrained from applying clear and present danger test in several free speech cases involving incitement to violence. In 1940, Congress enacted the Smith Act, making it illegal to advocate \"the propriety of overthrowing or destroying any government in the United States by force and violence.\" In \"Dennis v. United States\" (1951), the Court upheld the law. In a concurring opinion, Justice Felix Frankfurter proposed a \"balancing test,\" which soon supplanted the \"clear and present danger\" test: \"The demands of free speech in a democratic society as well as the interest in national security are better served by candid and informed weighing of the competing interests, within the confines of the judicial process.\"\nDuring the Vietnam War, the Court's position on public criticism of the government changed drastically, as its reading of the First Amendment broadened further. In 1969, it handed down its decision in \"Brandenburg v. Ohio\" (1969), expressly overruling \"Whitney v. California\". \"Brandenburg\" discarded the \"clear and present danger\" test introduced in \"Schenck\" and further eroded \"Dennis\". Now the Supreme Court referred to the right to speak openly of violent action and revolution in broad terms: \"the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not allow a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or cause such action.\"\nPolitical speech.\nAnonymous speech.\nThe Supreme Court has generally safeguarded anonymous speech under the First Amendment. This is especially pertinent in cases concerning controversial political groups, such as the NAACP and the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, where their anonymity helped secure their right to assembly. In \"Talley v. California\" (1960), the Court struck down a Los Angeles city ordinance that criminalized distributing anonymous pamphlets. Justice Hugo Black wrote in the majority opinion: \"There can be no doubt that such an identification requirement would tend to restrict freedom to distribute information and thereby freedom of expression.\" However, the court has been less protective of such speech in campaign finance donations and on the internet.\nCampaign finance.\nThe Court considers campaign donations as speech sometimes protected by the First Amendment. In \"Buckley v. Valeo\" (1976), the Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of limits on campaign contributions, saying they \"serve[d] the basic governmental interest in safeguarding the integrity of the electoral process without directly impinging upon the rights of individual citizens and candidates to engage in political debate and discussion.\" However, the same decision established campaign finance as a form of political speech. Over thirty years later, the Court ruled in \"Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission\" (2010) that restrictions on independent political spending by corporations or unions violated the Free Speech Clause and were therefore unconstitutional. This, in effect, \"enabled corporations and other outside groups to spend unlimited money on elections.\" Federal aggregate limits on how much a person can donate to candidates, parties, and political action committees were later found to clash with the First Amendment in \"McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission\" (2014).\nProfessional/occupational speech.\nSome federal courts have suggested that a First Amendment distinction exists between speech directed at the public and speech aimed at individuals in a professional, fiduciary, or business context\u2014so called occupational, or professional, speech. For example, in \"Lowe v. Securities Exchange Commission\" (1985), Justice Byron White argued that the government could permissibly restrict the speech of \"[o]ne who takes the affairs of a client personally in hand and purports to exercise judgment on behalf of the client in the light of the client's individual needs and circumstances.\" Over time, a number of courts adopted Justice White's view in what became known as the \"professional speech doctrine.\" In \"National Institute of Family &amp; Life Advocates v. Becerra\" (2018), however, the Supreme Court repudiated the doctrine, claiming that \"this Court has never recognized 'professional speech' as a separate category of speech subject to different rules.\"\nFlag desecration.\nThere has been significant debate over whether flag desecration is protected by the First Amendment. The Supreme Court addressed this issue in \"Street v. New York\" (1969), amid a popular trend of burning the U.S. flag to protest the Vietnam War. While it found a New York law criminalizing attacking any U.S. flag in various ways unconstitutional, it left the constitutionality of flag-burning unaddressed. However, in \"Texas v. Johnson\" (1989), the Court explicitly ruled that flag burnings are a form of protected speech. \nSchool speech.\nIn \"Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District\" (1969), the Supreme Court extended free speech rights to students in school. The case involved several students who were punished for wearing black armbands to protest the Vietnam War. The Court ruled that the school could not restrict symbolic speech that did not \"materially and substantially\" interrupt school activities. Justice Abe Fortas wrote: \"It can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.\" However, since 1969, the Court has also placed several limitations on \"Tinker\". In \"Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier\" (1988), the Court found that schools need not tolerate student speech that is inconsistent with their basic educational mission, and in \"Morse v. Frederick\" (2007), it ruled that schools could restrict student speech at school-sponsored events, even events away from school grounds, if students promote \"illegal drug use.\" In 2014, the University of Chicago released the \"Chicago Statement\", a free speech policy statement designed to combat censorship on campus, which was later adopted by other prestigious universities.\nCompelled speech.\nThe Supreme Court has determined that the First Amendment also protects citizens from being compelled by the government to say or to pay for certain speech. In \"West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette\" (1943), it was ruled that school children could not be punished for refusing either to say the pledge of allegiance or salute the American flag. The Court determined in \"Janus v. AFSCME\" (2018) that requiring a public sector employee to pay dues to a union of which he is not a member violated the First Amendment.\nHate and offensive speech.\nHate speech, while difficult to define precisely, is safeguarded by the First Amendment. In fact, Justice John Marshall Harlan II addressed the subjectivity that belies one's understanding a statement as hate speech: \"One man's vulgarity is another man's lyric.\" The American Library Association provides a general definition of hate speech: \"any form of expression through which speakers intend to vilify, humiliate, or incite hatred against a group or a class of persons on the basis of race, religion, skin color, sexual identity, gender identity, ethnicity, disability, or national origin.\" \"Freedom for the thought we hate,\" as expressed by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., is guaranteed, and the Court has recognized it. In one case, \"Snyder v. Phelps\" (2011), the Court found that individuals who picketed a military funeral holding signs stating \"God Hates Fags\" and \"Thank God for Dead Soldiers\" were acting within the limits of the First Amendment. \nHowever, a distinction is made between hate speech and hate crimes. The latter stirs up criminal activity or threatens specific individuals or groups and is therefore illegal. Fighting words\u2014personal insults and deliberately violent statements directed at a particular person or group\u2014also do not qualify as free speech. For instance, in the 1940s, a man who called a police officer a \"God-damned racketeer\u201d and \"a damned fascist\" was arrested, and the Court upheld his conviction. On the other hand, in \"Texas v. Johnson\" (1989), it did not find public flag desecration unconstitutional and, in fact, deemed it a form of protected speech: while the act was offensive, it was not meant as a direct personal insult toward any passersby. Justice William J. Brennan Jr. wrote in the decision that \"if there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea offensive or disagreeable.\" The fighting words doctrine itself has been criticized and labelled as a \"relic\" of a bygone age.\nCommercial speech.\nCommercial speech, done for the purpose of selling a product or service, is entitled to First Amendment protections but not as much as other forms of speech, such as that political. The Supreme Court began treating commercial speech thus in the 1970s; in \"Virginia State Pharmacy Board v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc.\" (1976), it struck down a state law barring the advertisement of drug prices by pharmacies. The Court has since noted that \"speech does not lose its protection simply because money is transacted through it,\" but this does not make commercial speech immune to regulation. In \"Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission\" (1980), the Court developed a four-pronged test to clarify when to restrict such speech: it must be misleading or involve illegal activity; the government must prove \"substantial interest\" in regulating it; the regulation must directly advance the governmental interest asserted; and the regulation must not be more strict than necessary. For example, the 1986 case \"Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Company of Puerto Rico\" saw the Court uphold Puerto Rico law that barred casinos from advertising to its residents, finding that it preserved the federal government's interest of preventing gambling and to protect residents' safety and well-being.\nDefamation.\nFor the first two-hundred years of American jurisprudence, libel placed specific emphasis on the result of the allegedly harmful publication over whether the publication was true or false. Libelous publications tended to \"degrade and injure another person\" or \"bring him into contempt, hatred or ridicule.\" Two centuries later, the Supreme Court's ruling in \"New York Times Co. v. Sullivan\" (1964) transformed American defamation law. Common law malice consisted of \"ill-will\" or \"wickedness,\" and thereafter, public officials seeking a lawsuit against a tortfeasor needed to prove by \"clear and convincing evidence\" that there was actual malice. \"Libel can claim no talismanic immunity from constitutional limitations,\" Justice William J. Brennan Jr. noted. While the actual malice standard applies to public officials and public figures, in \"Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.\" (1974) the Court ruled that actual malice need not be shown in cases involving private individuals. Moreover, in \"Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co.\" (1990), it was ruled that the First Amendment offers no wholesale exception to defamation law for statements labeled \"opinion,\" but instead that a statement must be provably false before it can be the subject of a libel suit.\nObscenity and pornography.\nAccording to the Supreme Court, the First Amendment's protection of free speech does not necessarily apply to obscene speech. It first tackled the matter in \"Roth v. United States\" (1957), in which it ruled that the First Amendment did not protect obscenity; the same case founded a standard to determine whether the material in question qualifies as obscenity. Throughout the following decade, members of the Court often reviewed films individually in a court building screening room to determine if they should be considered obscene. Justice Potter Stewart, in \"Jacobellis v. Ohio\" (1964), famously said that, although he could not precisely define pornography, \"I know it when I see it.\" The so-called \"Roth\" test was expanded when the Court decided \"Miller v. California\" (1973). Under the \"Miller\" test, a work is obscene if: \"a) 'the average person, applying contemporary community standards' would find the work, as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest... b)the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law, and (c)the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\nPornography, except for child pornography, is in practice free of governmental restrictions in the U.S., though pornography about \"extreme\" sexual practices is occasionally prosecuted. Child pornography is not subject to the \"Miller\" test, as the Supreme Court decided in \"New York v. Ferber\" (1982) and \"Osborne v. Ohio\" (1990), ruling that the government's interest in protecting children from abuse was paramount. Personal possession of obscene material in the home may not be prohibited by law, as per \"Stanley v. Georgia\" (1969).\nFreedom of the press.\nThe Free Press Clause protects the right of individuals to express themselves through publication and dissemination of information, ideas and opinions without interference, constraint or prosecution by the government. In \"Lovell v. City of Griffin\" (1938), Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes defined \"press\" as \"every sort of publication which affords a vehicle of information and opinion\". This right has been extended to media including newspapers, books, plays, movies, and video games. While it is an open question whether people who blog or use social media are journalists entitled to protection by media shield laws, they are protected equally by the Free Speech Clause and the Free Press Clause, because both clauses do not distinguish between media businesses and nonprofessional speakers. Justice Felix Frankfurter stated in a concurring opinion in another case succinctly: \"[T]he purpose of the Constitution was not to erect the press into a privileged institution but to protect all persons in their right to print what they will as well as to utter it.\" In \"Mills v. Alabama\" (1943) the Supreme Court laid out the purpose of the free press clause: \"... there is practically universal agreement that a major purpose of [the First Amendment] was to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs. ... the press serves and was designed to serve as a powerful antidote to any abuses of power by governmental officials, and as a constitutionally chosen means for keeping officials elected by the people responsible to all the people whom they were selected to serve.\" Justice Lewis F. Powell clarifies in \"Branzburg v. Hayes\" (1972) that a claim for press privilege \"should be judged on its facts by the striking of a proper balance between freedom of the press and the obligation of all citizens to give relevant testimony with respect to criminal conduct.\"\nA landmark decision for press freedom came in \"Near v. Minnesota\" (1931), in which the Supreme Court rejected prior restraint (pre-publication censorship). In this case, the Minnesota legislature passed a statute allowing courts to shut down \"malicious, scandalous and defamatory newspapers\", allowing a defense of truth only in cases where the truth had been told \"with good motives and for justifiable ends\". The Court applied the Free Press Clause to the states, rejecting the statute as unconstitutional. Hughes quoted Madison in the majority decision, writing, \"The impairment of the fundamental security of life and property by criminal alliances and official neglect emphasizes the primary need of a vigilant and courageous press.\"\nHowever, \"Near\" also noted an exception, allowing prior restraint in cases such as \"publication of sailing dates of transports or the number or location of troops\". This exception was a key point in another landmark case four decades later: \"New York Times Co. v. United States\" (1971), in which the administration of President Richard Nixon sought to ban the publication of the \"Pentagon Papers\", classified government documents about the Vietnam War secretly copied by analyst Daniel Ellsberg. The Court found that the Nixon administration had not met the heavy burden of proof required for prior restraint. Justice Brennan, drawing on \"Near\" in a concurrent opinion, wrote that \"only governmental allegation and proof that publication must inevitably, directly, and immediately cause the occurrence of an evil kindred to imperiling the safety of a transport already at sea can support even the issuance of an interim restraining order.\" Justices Black and Douglas went still further, writing that prior restraints were never justified.\nThe courts have rarely treated content-based regulation of journalism with any sympathy. In \"Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo\" (1974), the Court unanimously struck down a state law requiring newspapers criticizing political candidates to publish their responses. The state claimed the law had been passed to ensure journalistic responsibility. The Supreme Court found that freedom, but not responsibility, is mandated by the First Amendment and so it ruled that the government may not force newspapers to publish that which they do not desire to publish, establishing a corporation's right not to speak.\nContent-based regulation of television and radio, however, have been sustained by the Supreme Court in various cases. Since there is a limited number of frequencies for non-cable television and radio stations, the government licenses them to various companies. However, the Supreme Court has ruled that the problem of scarcity does not allow the raising of a First Amendment issue. The government may restrain broadcasters, but only on a content-neutral basis. In \"Federal Communications Commission v. Pacifica Foundation\", the Supreme Court upheld the Federal Communications Commission's authority to restrict the use of \"indecent\" material in broadcasting.\nState governments retain the right to tax newspapers, just as they may tax other commercial products. Generally, however, taxes that focus exclusively on newspapers have been found unconstitutional, such as n \"Grosjean v. American Press Co.\" (1936). In \"Leathers v. Medlock\" (1991), the Supreme Court found that states may treat different types of the media differently, such as by taxing cable television, but not newspapers. The Court found that \"differential taxation of speakers, even members of the press, does not implicate the First Amendment unless the tax is directed at, or presents the danger of suppressing, particular ideas.\"\nRight to petition and freedom of assembly.\nThe Petition Clause protects the right \"to petition the government for a redress of grievances\". The right expanded over the years: \"It is no longer confined to demands for 'a redress of grievances', in any accurate meaning of these words, but comprehends demands for an exercise by the government of its powers in furtherance of the interest and prosperity of the petitioners and of their views on politically contentious matters.\" The right to petition the government for a redress of grievances therefore includes the right to communicate with government officials, lobbying government officials and petitioning the courts by filing lawsuits with a legal basis. According to the Supreme Court, petitions on behald of private interests seeking personal gain and those calling for peaceful legislative change are also protected.\nThe Petition Clause first came to prominence in the 1830s, when Congress established the gag rule barring anti-slavery petitions from being heard; the rule was overturned by Congress several years later. Petitions against the Espionage Act of 1917 resulted in imprisonments. The Supreme Court did not rule on either issue. Today, this right encompasses petitions to all three branches of the federal government\u2014the Congress, the executive and the judiciary\u2014and has been extended to the states through incorporation. In \"Borough of Duryea v. Guarnieri\" (2011), the Supreme Court declared that the Free Speech Clause and the Petition Clause are mutually integral to the democratic process as both foster the exchange and expression of ideas. \nThe right of assembly is the individual right of people to come together and collectively express, promote, pursue, and defend their collective or shared ideas. This right is deemed equally important as those of free speech and free press, as observed by the Court in \"De Jonge v. Oregon\" (1937). The right of peaceable assembly was originally distinguished from the right to petition. In \"United States v. Cruikshank\" (1875), the first case in which the right to assembly was before the Supreme Court, the court broadly declared the outlines of the right of assembly and its connection to the right of petition: \"The very idea of a government, republican in form, implies a right on the part of its citizens to meet peaceably for consultation in respect to public affairs and to petition for a redress of grievances.\"\nJustice Morrison Waite's opinion for the Court carefully distinguished the right to peaceably assemble as a secondary right, while the right to petition was labeled to be a primary right. Later cases, however, paid less attention to these distinctions. An example of this is \"Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization\" (1939), where it was decided that the freedom of assembly covered by the First Amendment applies to public forums like streets and parks. In \"Hague\" the right of assembly was given a broad meaning, because the right of assembly can be used \"for communication of views on national questions\" as well as for \"holding meetings and disseminating information whether for the organization of labor unions or for any other lawful purpose.\"\nFreedom of association.\nAlthough the First Amendment does not explicitly mention freedom of association, the Supreme Court ruled in \"NAACP v. Alabama\" (1958) that this freedom was protected by the amendment and that privacy of membership was an essential part of this freedom. In \"Roberts v. United States Jaycees\" (1984), the Court stated that \"implicit in the right to engage in activities protected by the First Amendment\" is \"a corresponding right to associate with others in pursuit of a wide variety of political, social, economic, educational, religious, and cultural ends\". In \"Roberts\" the Court held that associations may not exclude people for reasons unrelated to the group's expression, such as gender. \nHowever, in \"Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Group of Boston\" (1995), the Court ruled that a group may exclude people from membership if their presence would affect the group's ability to advocate a particular point of view. Likewise, in \"Boy Scouts of America v. Dale\" (2000), the Court ruled that a New Jersey law, which forced the Boy Scouts of America to admit an openly gay member, to be an unconstitutional abridgment of the Boy Scouts' right to free association.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The amendment was a response to the Quartering Acts passed by the Parliament of Great Britain during the buildup to the American Revolutionary War, which had allowed the British Army to lodge soldiers in public buildings.\nThe Third Amendment was introduced in Congress in 1789 by James Madison as a part of the United States Bill of Rights, in response to Anti-Federalist objections to the new Constitution. Congress proposed the amendment to the states on September 28, 1789, and by December 15, 1791, the necessary three-quarters of the states had ratified it. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson announced the adoption of the amendment on March 1, 1792.\nThe amendment is one of the least controversial of the Constitution and is rarely litigated, with criminal justice writer Radley Balko calling it the \"runt piglet\" of the U.S. Constitution. To date, it has never been the primary basis of a Supreme Court decision, though it was the basis of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit case \"Engblom v. Carey\" in 1982.\nText.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.\nBackground.\nIn 1765, the Parliament of Great Britain enacted the first of the Quartering Acts, requiring the Thirteen Colonies to provide food to British Army troops serving in the colonies, and ordering that if their local barracks provided insufficient space, that colonial authorities lodge troops in public buildings such as alehouses, inns, and livery stables. After the Boston Tea Party, the Quartering Act of 1774 was enacted. As one of the Intolerable Acts that pushed the colonies toward revolution, it authorized British troops to be housed wherever necessary, though no troops were ever quartered in inhabited homes. The quartering of troops was cited as one of the colonists' grievances in the United States Declaration of Independence.\nAdoption.\nAfter several years of comparatively weak government under the Articles of Confederation, a Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia proposed a new constitution on September 17, 1787, featuring a stronger chief executive and other changes. George Mason, a Constitutional Convention delegate and the drafter of Virginia's Declaration of Rights, proposed that a bill of rights listing and guaranteeing civil liberties be included. Other delegates\u2014including future Bill of Rights drafter James Madison\u2014disagreed, arguing that existing state guarantees of civil liberties were sufficient and that any attempt to enumerate individual rights risked implying that other, unnamed rights were unprotected. After a brief debate, Mason's proposal was defeated by a unanimous vote of the state delegations.\nFor the constitution to be ratified, however, nine of the thirteen states were required to approve it in state conventions. Opposition to ratification (\"Anti-Federalism\") was partly based on the Constitution's lack of adequate guarantees for civil liberties. Supporters of the Constitution in states where popular sentiment was against ratification (including Virginia, Massachusetts, and New York) successfully proposed that their state conventions both ratify the Constitution and call for the addition of a bill of rights. Several state conventions specifically proposed a provision against the quartering of troops in private homes. At the 1788 Virginia Ratifying Convention, Patrick Henry stated, \"One of our first complaints, under the former government, was the quartering of troops among us. This was one of the principal reasons for dissolving the connection with Great Britain. Here we may have troops in time of peace. They may be billeted in any manner\u2014to tyrannize, oppress, and crush us.\"\nProposal and ratification.\nIn the 1st United States Congress, following the state legislatures' request, James Madison proposed twenty constitutional amendments based on state bills of rights and English sources such as the Bill of Rights 1689; one of these was a prohibition against quartering troops in private homes. Several revisions to the future Third Amendment were proposed in Congress, which chiefly differed in the way in which peace and war were distinguished (including the possibility of a situation, such as unrest, which was neither peace nor war), and whether the executive or the legislature would have the authority to authorize quartering. However, the amendment ultimately passed Congress almost unchanged and by unanimous vote. Congress reduced Madison's proposed twenty amendments to twelve, and these were submitted to the states for ratification on September 25, 1789.\nBy the time the Bill of Rights was submitted to the states for ratification, opinions had shifted in both parties. Many Federalists, who had previously opposed a Bill of Rights, now supported the Bill as a means of silencing the Anti-Federalists' most effective criticism. Many Anti-Federalists, in contrast, now opposed it, realizing the Bill's adoption would greatly lessen the chances of a second constitutional convention, which they desired. Anti-Federalists such as Richard Henry Lee also argued that the Bill left the most objectionable portions of the Constitution, such as the federal judiciary and direct taxation, intact.\nOn November 20, 1789, New Jersey ratified eleven of the twelve amendments, rejecting ArticleII, which regulated Congressional pay raises. On December 19 and 22, respectively, Maryland and North Carolina ratified all twelve amendments. On January 19, 25, and 28, 1790, respectively, South Carolina, New Hampshire, and Delaware ratified the Bill, though New Hampshire rejected the amendment on Congressional pay raises, and Delaware rejected ArticleI, which regulated the size of the House. This brought the total of ratifying states to six of the required ten, but the process stalled in other states: Connecticut and Georgia found a Bill of Rights unnecessary and so refused to ratify, while Massachusetts ratified most of the amendments, but failed to send official notice to the Secretary of State that it had done so.\nIn February through June 1790, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island ratified eleven of the amendments, though all three rejected the amendment on Congressional pay raises. Virginia initially postponed its debate, but after Vermont was admitted to the Union in 1791, the total number of states needed for ratification rose to eleven. Vermont ratified on November 3, 1791, approving all twelve amendments, and Virginia finally followed on December 15, 1791. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson announced the adoption of the ten successfully ratified amendments on March 1, 1792.\nJudicial interpretation.\nThe Third Amendment is among the least cited sections of the U.S. Constitution. In the words of \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\", \"as the history of the country progressed with little conflict on American soil, the amendment has had little occasion to be invoked.\" To date, no major Supreme Court decision has used the amendment as its primary basis.\nThe legal historian Tom W. Bell argued in 1993 that the quartering of American soldiers during the War of 1812 and American Civil War violated the Third Amendment, but this argument was never presented in court during either war. Following the Civil War, the Army compensated property owners for rent and damages, which may have preempted Third Amendment claims.\nThe Third Amendment has been invoked in a few instances as helping establish an implicit right to privacy in the Constitution. Justice William O. Douglas used the amendment along with others in the Bill of Rights as a partial basis for the majority decision in \"Griswold v. Connecticut\" (1965), which cited the Third Amendment as implying a belief that an individual's home should be free from agents of the state.\nIn one of the seven opinions in \"Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer\" (1952), Justice Robert H. Jackson cited the Third Amendment as providing evidence of the Framers' intent to constrain executive power even during wartime:\n[t]hat military powers of the Commander in Chief were not to supersede representative government of internal affairs seems obvious from the Constitution and from elementary American history. Time out of mind, and even now in many parts of the world, a military commander can seize private housing to shelter his troops. Not so, however, in the United States, for the Third Amendment says... [E]ven in war time, his seizure of needed military housing must be authorized by Congress.\nOne of the few times a federal court was asked to invalidate a law or action on Third Amendment grounds was in \"Engblom v. Carey\" (1982). In 1979, prison officials in New York organized a strike; they were evicted from their prison facility residences, which were reassigned to members of the National Guard who had temporarily taken their place as prison guards. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled: (1) that the term \"owner\" in the Third Amendment includes tenants (paralleling similar cases regarding the Fourth Amendment, governing search and seizure), (2) National Guard troops are \"soldiers\" for purposes of the Third Amendment, and (3) that the Third Amendment is incorporated (applies to the states) by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment. The case was remanded to the district court, which dismissed it on the grounds that state officials could not have been aware of this interpretation.\nIn the most recent Third Amendment decision handed down by a federal court, on February 2, 2015, the United States District Court for the District of Nevada held in \"Mitchell v. City of Henderson\" that the Third Amendment does not apply to intrusions by municipal police officers as they are not soldiers. For his claims under the Third Amendment, Mitchell had alleged that the police used his house as a lookout point. \nIn an earlier case, \"United States v. Valenzuela\" (1951), the defendant asked that a federal rent-control law be struck down because it was \"the incubator and hatchery of swarms of bureaucrats to be quartered as storm troopers upon the people in violation of AmendmentIII of the United States Constitution.\" The court declined his request. Later, in \"Jones v. United States Secretary of Defense\" (1972), Army reservists unsuccessfully cited the Third Amendment as justification for refusing to march in a parade. Similar arguments in a variety of contexts have been denied in other cases.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was ratified on December 15, 1791, along with nine other articles of the United States Bill of Rights. In \"District of Columbia v. Heller\" (2008), the Supreme Court affirmed that the right belongs to individuals, for self-defense in the home, while also including, as \"dicta\", that the right is not unlimited and does not preclude the existence of certain long-standing prohibitions such as those forbidding \"the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill\" or restrictions on \"the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons\". In \"McDonald v. City of Chicago\" (2010) the Supreme Court ruled that state and local governments are limited to the same extent as the federal government from infringing upon this right. \"New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen\" (2022) assured the right to carry weapons in public spaces with reasonable exceptions.\nThe Second Amendment was based partially on the right to keep and bear arms in English common law and was influenced by the English Bill of Rights 1689. Sir William Blackstone described this right as an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense and resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. While both James Monroe and John Adams supported the Constitution being ratified, its most influential framer was James Madison. In \"Federalist\" No. 46, Madison wrote how a federal army could be kept in check by the militia, \"a standing army... would be opposed [by] militia.\" He argued that State governments \"would be able to repel the danger\" of a federal army, \"It may well be doubted, whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops.\" He contrasted the federal government of the United States to the European kingdoms, which he described as \"afraid to trust the people with arms\", and assured that \"the existence of subordinate governments... forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition\".\nBy January 1788, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia and Connecticut ratified the Constitution without insisting upon amendments. Several amendments were proposed, but were not adopted at the time the Constitution was ratified. For example, the Pennsylvania convention debated fifteen amendments, one of which concerned the right of the people to be armed, another with the militia. The Massachusetts convention also ratified the Constitution with an attached list of proposed amendments. In the end, the ratification convention was so evenly divided between those for and against the Constitution that the federalists agreed to the Bill of Rights to assure ratification. \nIn \"United States v. Cruikshank\" (1876), the Supreme Court ruled that, \"The right to bear arms is not granted by the Constitution; neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence. The Second Amendments [\"sic\"] means no more than that it shall not be infringed by Congress, and has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the National Government.\" In \"United States v. Miller\" (1939), the Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment did not protect weapon types not having a \"reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia\".\nIn the 21st century, the amendment has been subjected to renewed academic inquiry and judicial interest. In \"District of Columbia v. Heller\" (2008), the Supreme Court handed down a landmark decision that held the amendment protects an individual's right to keep a gun for self-defense. This was the first time the Court had ruled that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual's right to own a gun. In \"McDonald v. Chicago\" (2010), the Supreme Court clarified that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment incorporated the Second Amendment against state and local governments. In \"Caetano v. Massachusetts\" (2016), the Supreme Court reiterated its earlier rulings that \"the Second Amendment extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that were not in existence at the time of the founding,\" and that its protection is not limited only to firearms, nor \"only those weapons useful in warfare.\" In addition to affirming the right to carry firearms in public, \"New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen\" (2022) created a new test that laws seeking to limit Second Amendment rights must be based on the history and tradition of gun rights, although the test was refined to focus on similar analogues and general principles rather than strict matches from the past in \"United States v. Rahimi\" (2024). The debate between various organizations regarding gun control and gun rights continues.\nText.\nThere are several versions of the text of the Second Amendment, each with capitalization or punctuation differences. Differences exist between the version passed by Congress and put on display and the versions ratified by the states. These differences have been a focus of debate regarding the meaning of the amendment, particularly regarding the importance of what the courts have called the prefatory clause.\nThe final, handwritten original of the Bill of Rights as passed by Congress, with the rest of the original prepared by scribe William Lambert, is preserved in the National Archives. This is the version ratified by Delaware and used by the Supreme Court in \"District of Columbia v. Heller\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\nSome state-ratified versions, such as Maryland's, omitted the first or final commas:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\nThe ratification acts from New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and South Carolina contained only one comma, but with differences in capitalization. Pennsylvania's act states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.\nThe ratification act from New Jersey has no commas:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.\nPre-Constitution background.\nInfluence of the English Bill of Rights of 1689.\nThe right of Protestants to bear arms in English history is regarded in English common law as a subordinate auxiliary right of the primary rights to personal security, personal liberty, and private property. According to Sir William Blackstone, \"The... last auxiliary right of the subject... is that of having arms for their defence, suitable to their condition and degree, and such as are allowed by law. Which is... declared by... statute, and is indeed a public allowance, under due restrictions, of the natural right of resistance and self-preservation, when the sanctions of society and laws are found insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression.\"\nThe English Bill of Rights of 1689 emerged from a tempestuous period in English politics during which two issues were major sources of conflict: the authority of the king to govern without the consent of Parliament, and the role of Catholics in a country with a staunchly Protestant majority. Ultimately, the Catholic James\u00a0II was overthrown in the Glorious Revolution, and his successors, the Protestants William\u00a0III and Mary\u00a0II, accepted the conditions that were codified in the bill. One of the issues the bill resolved was the authority of the king to disarm his subjects, after James\u00a0II had disarmed many Protestants that were \"suspected or knowne\" of disliking the government, and had argued with Parliament over his desire to maintain a standing (or permanent) army. The bill states that it is acting to restore \"ancient rights\" trampled upon by James\u00a0II, though some have argued that the English Bill of Rights created a new right to have arms, which developed out of a duty to have arms. In \"District of Columbia v. Heller\" (2008), the Supreme Court did not accept this view, remarking that the English right at the time of the passing of the English Bill of Rights was \"clearly an individual right, having nothing whatsoever to do with service in the militia\" and that it was a right not to be disarmed by the Crown and was not the granting of a new right to have arms.\nThe text of the English Bill of Rights of 1689 includes language protecting the right of Protestants against disarmament by the Crown, stating: \"That the Subjects which are Protestants may have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by Law.\" It also contained text that aspired to bind future Parliaments, though under English constitutional law no Parliament can bind any later Parliament.\nThe statement in the English Bill of Rights concerning the right to bear arms is often quoted only in the passage where it is written as above and not in its full context. In its full context it is clear that the bill was asserting the right of Protestant citizens not to be disarmed by the king without the consent of Parliament and was merely restoring rights to Protestants that the previous King briefly and unlawfully had removed. In its full context it reads:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Whereas the late King James the Second by the Assistance of diverse evil Councillors Judges and Ministers employed by him did endeavour to subvert and extirpate the Protestant Religion and the Laws and Liberties of this Kingdom \"(list of grievances including)\"... by causing several good Subjects being Protestants to be disarmed at the same time when Papists were both Armed and employed contrary to Law, \"(Recital regarding the change of monarch)\"... thereupon the said Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons pursuant to their respective Letters and Elections being now assembled in a full and free Representative of this Nation taking into their most serious Consideration the best means for attaining the Ends aforesaid Doe in the first place (as their Ancestors in like Case have usually done) for the Vindicating and Asserting their ancient Rights and Liberties, Declare \"(list of rights including)\"... That the Subjects which are Protestants may have Arms for their Defense suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by Law.\nThe historical link between the English Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment, which both codify an existing right and do not create a new one, has been acknowledged by the U.S. Supreme Court.\nThe English Bill of Rights includes the proviso that arms must be as \"allowed by law\". This has been the case before and after the passage of the Bill. While it did not override earlier restrictions on the ownership of guns for hunting, it is subject to the parliamentary right to implicitly or explicitly repeal earlier enactments.\nThere is some difference of opinion as to how revolutionary the events of 1688\u201389 actually were, and several commentators make the point that the provisions of the English Bill of Rights did not represent new laws, but rather stated existing rights. Mark Thompson wrote that, apart from determining the succession, the English Bill of Rights did \"little more than set forth certain points of existing laws and simply secured to Englishmen the rights of which they were already posessed [\"sic\"].\" Before and after the English Bill of Rights, the government could always disarm any individual or class of individuals it considered dangerous to the peace of the realm. In 1765, Sir William Blackstone wrote the \"Commentaries on the Laws of England\" describing the right to have arms in England during the 18th century as a subordinate auxiliary right of the subject that was \"also declared\" in the English Bill of Rights.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The fifth and last auxiliary right of the subject, that I shall at present mention, is that of having arms for their defence, suitable to their condition and degree, and such as are allowed by law. Which is also declared by the same statute 1 W. &amp; M. st.2. c.2. and is indeed a public allowance, under due restrictions, of the natural right of resistance and self-preservation, when the sanctions of society and laws are found insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression.\nAlthough there is little doubt that the writers of the Second Amendment were heavily influenced by the English Bill of Rights, it is a matter of interpretation as to whether they were intent on preserving the power to regulate arms to the states over the federal government (as the English Parliament had reserved for itself against the monarch) or whether it was intent on creating a new right akin to the right of others written into the Constitution (as the Supreme Court decided in \"Heller\"). Some in the United States have preferred the \"rights\" argument arguing that the English Bill of Rights had granted a right. The need to have arms for self-defence was not really in question. Peoples all around the world since time immemorial had armed themselves for the protection of themselves and others, and as organized nations began to appear these arrangements had been extended to the protection of the state. Without a regular army and police force, it had been the duty of certain men to keep watch and ward at night and to confront and capture suspicious persons. Every subject had an obligation to protect the king's peace and assist in the suppression of riots.\nInfluence of the British Militia Act 1757.\nIn 1757 Great Britain's Parliament created the Militia Act 1757 (30 Geo. 2. c. 25), \"An Act for better ordering of the militia forces in the several counties of that part of Great Britain called England\". This act declared that \"a well-ordered and well-disciplined militia is essentially necessary to the safety, peace and prosperity of this kingdom,\" and that the current militia laws for the regulation of the militia were defective and ineffectual. Influenced by this act, in 1775 Timothy Pickering created \"An Easy Plan of Discipline for a Militia\". Greatly inhibited by the events surrounding Salem, Massachusetts, where the plan was printed, Pickering submitted the writing to George Washington. On May 1, 1776, the Massachusetts Bay Councell resolved that Pickering's discipline, a modification of the 1757 act, be the discipline of their Militia. On March 29, 1779, for members of the Continental Army this was replaced by Von Steuben's Regulations for the Order and Discipline of the Troops of the United States. With ratification of the Second Amendment, after May 8, 1792, the entire United States Militia, barring two declarations, would be regulated by Von Steuben's Discipline.\nAmerica before the U.S. Constitution.\nKing Charles\u00a0I authorized the use of arms for special defense and safety, on land and at sea, against:\nWhich of these considerations were thought of as most important and ultimately found expression in the Second Amendment is disputed. Some of these purposes were explicitly mentioned in early state constitutions; for example, the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776 asserted that, \"the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of themselves and the state.\"\nDuring the 1760s pre-revolutionary period, the established colonial militia was composed of colonists, including many who were loyal to British rule. As defiance and opposition to British rule developed, a distrust of these Loyalists in the militia became widespread among the colonists known as Patriots, who favored independence from British rule. As a result, some Patriots created their own militias that excluded the Loyalists and then sought to stock independent armories for their militias. In response to this arms build-up, the British Parliament established an embargo of firearms, parts and ammunition against the American colonies which in some instance came to be referred to as Powder Alarms. King George III also began disarming individuals who were in the most rebellious areas in the 1760s and 1770s.\nBritish and Loyalist efforts to disarm the colonial Patriot militia armories in the early phases of the American Revolution resulted in the Patriot colonists protesting by citing the Declaration of Right, Blackstone's summary of the Declaration of Right, their own militia laws and common law rights to self-defense. While British policy in the early phases of the Revolution clearly aimed to prevent coordinated action by the Patriot militia, some have argued that there is no evidence that the British sought to restrict the traditional common law right of self-defense. Patrick J. Charles disputes these claims citing similar disarming by the patriots and challenging those scholars' interpretation of Blackstone.\nThe right of the colonists to arms and rebellion against oppression was asserted, for example, in a pre-revolutionary newspaper editorial in 1769 objecting to the Crown suppression of colonial opposition to the Townshend Acts:\nThe armed forces that won the American Revolution consisted of the standing Continental Army created by the Continental Congress, together with regular French army and naval forces and various state and regional militia units. In opposition, the British forces consisted of a mixture of the standing British Army, Loyalist militia and Hessian auxiliaries. Following the Revolution, the United States was governed by the Articles of Confederation. Federalists argued that this government had an unworkable division of power between Congress and the states, which caused military weakness, as the standing army was reduced to as few as 80 men. They considered it to be bad that there was no effective federal military crackdown on an armed tax rebellion in western Massachusetts known as Shays' Rebellion. Anti-federalists, on the other hand, took the side of limited government and sympathized with the rebels, many of whom were former Revolutionary War soldiers. Subsequently, the Constitutional Convention proposed in 1787 to grant Congress exclusive power to raise and support a standing army and navy of unlimited size. Anti-federalists objected to the shift of power from the states to the federal government, but as adoption of the Constitution became more and more likely, they shifted their strategy to establishing a bill of rights that would put some limits on federal power.\nModern scholars Thomas B. McAffee and Michael J. Quinlan have stated that James Madison \"did not invent the right to keep and bear arms when he drafted the Second Amendment; the right was pre-existing at both common law and in the early state constitutions.\" In contrast, historian Jack Rakove suggests that Madison's intention in framing the Second Amendment was to provide assurances to moderate Anti-Federalists that the militias would not be disarmed.\nOne aspect of the gun control debate is the conflict between gun control laws and the right to rebel against unjust governments. Blackstone in his \"Commentaries\" alluded to this right to rebel as the natural right of resistance and self preservation, to be used only as a last resort, exercisable when \"the sanctions of society and laws are found insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression\". Some believe that the framers of the Bill of Rights sought to balance not just political power, but also military power, between the people, the states and the nation, as Alexander Hamilton explained in his \"Concerning the Militia\" essay published in 1788:\nThere was an ongoing debate beginning in 1789 about \"the people\" fighting governmental tyranny (as described by Anti-Federalists); or the risk of mob rule of \"the people\" (as described by the Federalists) related to the increasingly violent French Revolution. A widespread fear, during the debates on ratifying the Constitution, was the possibility of a military takeover of the states by the federal government, which could happen if the Congress passed laws prohibiting states from arming citizens,{{efn|Cooke, p.\u00a0100. \"This is another protection against a possible abuse by Congress. The right protected is really the right of a state to maintain an armed militia, or national guard, as we call it now. In the eighteenth century people feared that Congress might, by passing a law, prohibit the states from arming their citizens. Then having all the armed strength at its command, the national government could overwhelm the states. Such a circumstance has never happened, but this amendment would prevent it. The Second Amendment does not give anybody or everybody the right to possess and use firearms. The states may very properly prescribe regulations and permits governing the use of guns within their borders.\"}} or prohibiting citizens from arming themselves. Though it has been argued that the states lost the power to arm their citizens when the power to arm the militia was transferred from the states to the federal government by Article{{nbsp}}I, Section{{nbsp}}8 of the Constitution, the individual right to arm was retained and strengthened by the Militia Acts of 1792 and the similar act of 1795.\nMore recently some have advanced what has been called the insurrectionist theory of the Second Amendment whereby it is the right of any citizen to take up arms against their government should they consider it illegitimate. Such a reading has been voiced by organizations such as the National Rifle Association of America (NRA) and by various individuals including some elected officials. Congressman Jamie Raskin, however, has argued that there is no basis in constitutional law or scholarship for this view. He notes that, not only does this represent a misreading of the text of the Amendment as drafted, it stands in violation of other elements of the Constitution.\nDrafting and adoption of the Constitution.\nIn March 1785, delegates from Virginia and Maryland assembled at the Mount Vernon Conference to fashion a remedy to the inefficiencies of the Articles of Confederation. The following year, at a meeting in Annapolis, Maryland, 12 delegates from five states (New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Virginia) met and drew up a list of problems with the current government model. At its conclusion, the delegates scheduled a follow-up meeting in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for May 1787 to present solutions to these problems, such as the absence of:\nIt quickly became apparent that the solution to all three of these problems required shifting control of the states' militias to the federal Congress and giving it the power to raise a standing army. Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution codified these changes by allowing the Congress to provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States by doing the following:\nSome representatives mistrusted proposals to enlarge federal powers, because they were concerned about the inherent risks of centralizing power. Federalists, including James Madison, initially argued that a bill of rights was unnecessary, sufficiently confident that the federal government could never raise a standing army powerful enough to overcome a militia. Federalist Noah Webster argued that an armed populace would have no trouble resisting the potential threat to liberty of a standing army. Anti-federalists, on the other hand, advocated amending the Constitution with clearly defined and enumerated rights providing more explicit constraints on the new government. Many Anti-federalists feared the new federal government would choose to disarm state militias. Federalists countered that in listing only certain rights, unlisted rights might lose protection. The Federalists realized there was insufficient support to ratify the Constitution without a bill of rights and so they promised to support amending the Constitution to add a bill of rights following the Constitution's adoption. This compromise persuaded enough Anti-federalists to vote for the Constitution, allowing for ratification. The Constitution was declared ratified on June\u00a021, 1788, when nine of the original thirteen states had ratified it. The remaining four states later followed suit, although the last two states, North Carolina and Rhode Island, ratified only after Congress had passed the Bill of Rights and sent it to the states for ratification. James Madison drafted what ultimately became the Bill of Rights, which was proposed by the first Congress on June\u00a08, 1789, and was adopted on December\u00a015, 1791.\nDebates on amending the Constitution.\nThe debate surrounding the Constitution's ratification is of practical importance, particularly to adherents of originalist and strict constructionist legal theories. In the context of such legal theories and elsewhere, it is important to understand the language of the Constitution in terms of what that language meant to the people who wrote and ratified the Constitution.\nRobert Whitehill, a delegate from Pennsylvania, sought to clarify the draft Constitution with a bill of rights explicitly granting individuals the right to hunt on their own land in season, though Whitehill's language was never debated.\nArgument for state power.\nThere was substantial opposition to the new Constitution because it moved the power to arm the state militias from the states to the federal government. This created a fear that the federal government, by neglecting the upkeep of the militia, could have overwhelming military force at its disposal through its power to maintain a standing army and navy, leading to a confrontation with the states, encroaching on the states' reserved powers and even engaging in a military takeover. Article VI of the Articles of Confederation states:\nIn contrast, Article I, Section 8, Clause 16 of the U.S. Constitution states:\nGovernment tyranny.\nA foundation of American political thought during the Revolutionary period was concern about political corruption and governmental tyranny. Even the federalists, fending off their opponents who accused them of creating an oppressive regime, were careful to acknowledge the risks of tyranny. Against that backdrop, the framers saw the personal right to bear arms as a potential check against tyranny. Theodore Sedgwick of Massachusetts expressed this sentiment by declaring that it is \"a chimerical idea to suppose that a country like this could ever be enslaved{{nbsp}}... Is it possible{{nbsp}}... that an army could be raised for the purpose of enslaving themselves or their brethren? Or, if raised whether they could subdue a nation of freemen, who know how to prize liberty and who have arms in their hands?\" Noah Webster similarly argued:\nGeorge Mason also argued the importance of the militia and right to bear arms by reminding his compatriots of the British government's efforts \"to disarm the people; that it was the best and most effectual way to enslave them{{nbsp}}... by totally disusing and neglecting the militia.\" He also clarified that under prevailing practice the militia included all people, rich and poor. \"Who are the militia? They consist now of the whole people, except a few public officers.\" Because all were members of the militia, all enjoyed the right to individually bear arms to serve therein.\nWriting after the ratification of the Constitution, but before the election of the first Congress, James Monroe included \"the right to keep and bear arms\" in a list of basic \"human rights\", which he proposed to be added to the Constitution.\nPatrick Henry argued in the Virginia ratification convention on June 5, 1788, for the dual rights to arms and resistance to oppression:\nTo maintain slavery.\nPreserving slave patrols.\nIn the slave states, the militia was available for military operations, but its biggest function was to police the slaves. According to Dr Carl T. Bogus, Professor of Law of the Roger Williams University Law School in Rhode Island, the Second Amendment was written to assure the Southern states that Congress would not undermine the slave system by using its newly acquired constitutional authority over the militia to disarm the state militia and thereby destroy the South's principal instrument of slave control.\nIn his close analysis of James Madison's writings, Bogus describes the South's obsession with militias during the ratification process:\nThis preoccupation is clearly expressed in 1788 by the slaveholder Patrick Henry:\nTherefore, Bogus argues, in a compromise with the slave states, and to reassure Patrick Henry, George Mason and other slaveholders that they would be able to keep their slave control militias independent of the federal government, James Madison (also slave owner) redrafted the Second Amendment into its current form \"for the specific purpose of assuring the Southern states, and particularly his constituents in Virginia, that the federal government would not undermine their security against slave insurrection by disarming the militia.\"\nLegal historian Paul Finkelman argues that this scenario is implausible. Henry and Mason were political enemies of Madison's, and neither man was in Congress at the time Madison drafted Bill of Rights; moreover, Patrick Henry argued against the ratification of both the Constitution and the Second Amendment, and it was Henry's opposition that led Patrick's home state of Virginia to be the last to ratify.\nFinkelman recognises that James Madison \"drafted an amendment to protect the right of the states to maintain their militias,\" but insists that \"The amendment had nothing to do with state police powers, which were the basis of slave patrols.\"\nTo avoid arming free blacks.\nFirstly, slave owners feared that enslaved blacks might be emancipated through military service. A few years earlier, there had been a precedent when Lord Dunmore offered freedom to slaves who escaped and joined his forces with \"Liberty to Slaves\" stitched onto their jacket pocket flaps. Freed slaves also served in General Washington's army.\nSecondly, they also greatly feared \"a ruinous slave rebellion in which their families would be slaughtered and their property destroyed.\" When Virginia ratified the Bill of Rights on December 15, 1791, the Haitian Revolution, a successful slave rebellion, was under way. The right to bear arms was therefore deliberately tied to membership in a militia by the slaveholder and chief drafter of the Amendment, James Madison, because only whites could join militias in the South.\nIn 1776, Thomas Jefferson had submitted a draft constitution for Virginia that said \"no freeman shall ever be debarred the use of arms within his own lands or tenements\". According to Picadio, this version was rejected because \"it would have given to free blacks the constitutional right to have firearms\".\nConflict and compromise in Congress produce the Bill of Rights.\nJames Madison's initial proposal for a bill of rights was brought to the floor of the House of Representatives on June 8, 1789, during the first session of Congress. The initial proposed passage relating to arms was:\nOn July 21, Madison again raised the issue of his bill and proposed that a select committee be created to report on it. The House voted in favor of Madison's motion, and the Bill of Rights entered committee for review. The committee returned to the House a reworded version of the Second Amendment on July 28. On August 17, that version was read into the \"Journal\":\nIn late August 1789, the House debated and modified the Second Amendment. These debates revolved primarily around the risk of \"mal-administration of the government\" using the \"religiously scrupulous\" clause to destroy the militia as British forces had attempted to destroy the Patriot militia at the commencement of the American Revolution. These concerns were addressed by modifying the final clause, and on August 24, the House sent the following version to the Senate:\nThe next day, August 25, the Senate received the amendment from the House and entered it into the Senate Journal. However, the Senate scribe added a comma before \"shall not be infringed\" and changed the semicolon separating that phrase from the religious exemption portion to a comma:\nBy this time, the proposed right to keep and bear arms was in a separate amendment, instead of being in a single amendment together with other proposed rights such as the due process right. As a representative explained, this change allowed each amendment to \"be passed upon distinctly by the States\". On September 4, the Senate voted to change the language of the Second Amendment by removing the definition of militia, and striking the conscientious objector clause:\nThe Senate returned to this amendment for a final time on September 9. A proposal to insert the words \"for the common defence\" next to the words \"bear arms\" was defeated. A motion passed to replace the words \"the best\", and insert in lieu thereof \"necessary to the\" . The Senate then slightly modified the language to read as the fourth article and voted to return the Bill of Rights to the House. The final version by the Senate was amended to read as:\nThe House voted on September 21, 1789, to accept the changes made by the Senate.\nThe enrolled original Joint Resolution passed by Congress on September 25, 1789, on permanent display in the Rotunda, reads as:\nOn December 15, 1791, the Bill of Rights (the first ten amendments to the Constitution) was adopted, having been ratified by three-fourths of the states, having been ratified as a group by all the fourteen states then in existence except Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Georgia{{snd}}which added ratifications in 1939.\nMilitia following ratification.\nDuring the first two decades following the ratification of the Second Amendment, public opposition to standing armies, among Anti-Federalists and Federalists alike, persisted and manifested itself locally as a general reluctance to create a professional armed police force, instead relying on county sheriffs, constables and night watchmen to enforce local ordinances. Though sometimes compensated, often these positions were unpaid{{snd}}held as a matter of civic duty. In these early decades, law enforcement officers were rarely armed with firearms, using billy clubs as their sole defensive weapons. In serious emergencies, a \"posse comitatus\", militia company, or group of vigilantes assumed law enforcement duties; these individuals were more likely than the local sheriff to be armed with firearms.\nOn May 8, 1792, Congress passed \"[a]n act more effectually to provide for the National Defence, by establishing an Uniform Militia throughout the United States\" requiring:\nThe act also gave specific instructions to domestic weapon manufacturers \"that from and after five years from the passing of this act, muskets for arming the militia as herein required, shall be of bores sufficient for balls of the eighteenth part of a pound.\" In practice, private acquisition and maintenance of rifles and muskets meeting specifications and readily available for militia duty proved problematic; estimates of compliance ranged from 10 to 65\u00a0percent. Compliance with the enrollment provisions was also poor. In addition to the exemptions granted by the law for custom-house officers and their clerks, post-officers and stage drivers employed in the care and conveyance of U.S. mail, ferrymen, export inspectors, pilots, merchant mariners and those deployed at sea in active service; state legislatures granted numerous exemptions under Section\u00a02 of the Act, including exemptions for: clergy, conscientious objectors, teachers, students, and jurors. Though a number of able-bodied white men remained available for service, many simply did not show up for militia duty. Penalties for failure to appear were enforced sporadically and selectively. None is mentioned in the legislation.\nThe first test of the militia system occurred in July 1794, when a group of disaffected Pennsylvania farmers rebelled against federal tax collectors whom they viewed as illegitimate tools of tyrannical power. Attempts by the four adjoining states to raise a militia for nationalization to suppress the insurrection proved inadequate. When officials resorted to drafting men, they faced bitter resistance. Forthcoming soldiers consisted primarily of draftees or paid substitutes as well as poor enlistees lured by enlistment bonuses. The officers, however, were of a higher quality, responding out of a sense of civic duty and patriotism, and generally critical of the rank and file. Most of the 13,000 soldiers lacked the required weaponry; the war department provided nearly two-thirds of them with guns. In October, President George Washington and General Harry Lee marched on the 7,000\u00a0rebels who conceded without fighting. The episode provoked criticism of the citizen militia and inspired calls for a universal militia. Secretary of War Henry Knox and Vice President John Adams had lobbied Congress to establish federal armories to stock imported weapons and encourage domestic production. Congress did subsequently pass \"[a]n act for the erecting and repairing of Arsenals and Magazines\" on April 2, 1794, two months prior to the insurrection. Nevertheless, the militia continued to deteriorate and twenty years later, the militia's poor condition contributed to several losses in the War of 1812, including the sacking of Washington, D.C., and the burning of the White House in 1814.\nIn the 20th century, Congress passed the Militia Act of 1903. The act defined the militia as every able-bodied male aged 18 to 44 who was a citizen or intended to become one. The militia was then divided by the act into the United States National Guard and the unorganized Reserve Militia.\nFederal law continues to define the militia as all able-bodied males aged 17 to 44, who are citizens or intend to become one, and female citizens who are members of the National Guard. The militia is divided into the organized militia, which consists of the National Guard and Naval Militia, and the unorganized militia.\nScholarly commentary.\nEarly commentary.\nThe \"Federal Farmer\".\nIn May 1788, the pseudonymous author \"Federal Farmer\" (his real identity is presumed to be either Richard Henry Lee or Melancton Smith) wrote in \"Additional Letters From The Federal Farmer #169\" or \"Letter XVIII\" regarding the definition of a \"militia\":\nGeorge Mason.\nIn June 1788, George Mason the Virginia Ratifying Convention regarding a \"militia:\"\nTench Coxe.\nIn 1792, Tench Coxe made the following point in a commentary on the Second Amendment:\nTucker/Blackstone.\nThe earliest published commentary on the Second Amendment by a major constitutional theorist was by St. George Tucker. He annotated a five-volume edition of Sir William Blackstone's \"Commentaries on the Laws of England\", a critical legal reference for early American attorneys published in 1803. Tucker wrote:\nFurther, Tucker criticized the English Bill of Rights for limiting gun ownership to the very wealthy, leaving the populace effectively disarmed, and expressed the hope that Americans \"never cease to regard the right of keeping and bearing arms as the surest pledge of their liberty.\"\nWilliam Rawle.\nTucker's commentary was soon followed, in 1825, by that of William Rawle in his landmark text \"A View of the Constitution of the United States of America\". Like Tucker, Rawle condemned England's \"arbitrary code for the preservation of game\", portraying that country as one that \"boasts so much of its freedom\", yet provides a right to \"protestant subjects only\" that it \"cautiously describ[es] to be that of bearing arms for their defence\" and reserves for \"[a] very small proportion of the people[.]\"{{sfn|Rawle|1829|p=126}}{{sfn|Rawle|1825|p=122}} In contrast, Rawle characterizes the second clause of the Second Amendment, which he calls the corollary clause, as a general prohibition against such capricious abuse of government power.\nJoseph Story.\nJoseph Story articulated in his influential \"Commentaries on the Constitution\" the orthodox view of the Second Amendment, which he viewed as the amendment's clear meaning:\nStory describes a militia as the \"natural defence of a free country\", both against foreign foes, domestic revolts and usurpation by rulers. The book regards the militia as a \"moral check\" against both usurpation and the arbitrary use of power, while expressing distress at the growing indifference of the American people to maintaining such an organized militia, which could lead to the undermining of the protection of the Second Amendment.\nLysander Spooner.\nAbolitionist Lysander Spooner, commenting on bills of rights, stated that the object of all bills of rights is to assert the rights of individuals against the government and that the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms was in support of the right to resist government oppression, as the only security against the tyranny of government lies in forcible resistance to injustice, for injustice will certainly be executed, unless forcibly resisted. Spooner's theory provided the intellectual foundation for John Brown and other radical abolitionists who believed that arming slaves was not only morally justified, but entirely consistent with the Second Amendment. An express connection between this right and the Second Amendment was drawn by Lysander Spooner who commented that a \"right of resistance\" is protected by both the right to trial by jury and the Second Amendment.\nThe congressional debate on the proposed Fourteenth Amendment concentrated on what the Southern States were doing to harm the newly freed slaves, including disarming the former slaves.\nTimothy Farrar.\nIn 1867, Judge Timothy Farrar published his \"Manual of the Constitution of the United States of America\", which was written when the Fourteenth Amendment was \"in the process of adoption by the State legislatures\":\nJudge Thomas Cooley.\nJudge Thomas M. Cooley, perhaps the most widely read constitutional scholar of the nineteenth century, wrote extensively about this amendment, and he explained in 1880 how the Second Amendment protected the \"right of the people\":\nCommentary since late 20th century.\nUntil the late 20th century, there was little scholarly commentary of the Second Amendment. In the latter half of the 20th century, there was considerable debate over whether the Second Amendment protected an individual right or a collective right. The debate centered on whether the prefatory clause (\"A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State\") declared the amendment's only purpose or merely announced a purpose to introduce the operative clause (\"the right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed\"). Scholars advanced three competing theoretical models for how the prefatory clause should be interpreted.\nThe first, known as the \"states' rights\" or \"collective right\" model, held that the Second Amendment does not apply to individuals; rather, it recognizes the right of each state to arm its militia. Under this approach, citizens \"have no right to keep or bear arms, but the states have a collective right to have the National Guard\". Advocates of collective rights models argued that the Second Amendment was written to prevent the federal government from disarming state militias, rather than to secure an individual right to possess firearms. Prior to 2001, every circuit court decision that interpreted the Second Amendment endorsed the \"collective right\" model. However, beginning with the Fifth Circuit's opinion \"United States v. Emerson\" in 2001, some circuit courts recognized that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to bear arms.\nThe second, known as the \"sophisticated collective right model\", held that the Second Amendment recognizes some limited individual right. However, this individual right could be exercised only by actively participating members of a functioning, organized state militia. Some scholars have argued that the \"sophisticated collective rights model\" is, in fact, the functional equivalent of the \"collective rights model\". Other commentators have observed that prior to \"Emerson\", five circuit courts specifically endorsed the \"sophisticated collective right model\".\nThe third, known as the \"standard model\", held that the Second Amendment recognized the personal right of individuals to keep and bear arms. Supporters of this model argued that \"although the first clause may describe a general purpose for the amendment, the second clause is controlling and therefore the amendment confers an individual right 'of the people' to keep and bear arms\". Additionally, scholars who favored this model argued the \"absence of founding-era militias mentioned in the Amendment's preamble does not render it a 'dead letter' because the preamble is a 'philosophical declaration' safeguarding militias and is but one of multiple 'civic purposes' for which the Amendment was enacted\".\nThe question of a collective right versus an individual right was progressively resolved in favor of the individual rights model, beginning with the Fifth Circuit ruling in \"United States v. Emerson\" (2001), along with the Supreme Court's rulings in \"District of Columbia v. Heller\" (2008), and \"McDonald v. Chicago\" (2010). In \"Heller\", the Supreme Court resolved any remaining circuit splits by ruling that the Second Amendment protects an individual right. Although the Second Amendment is the only Constitutional amendment with a prefatory clause, such linguistic constructions were widely used elsewhere in the late eighteenth century.\nWarren E. Burger, a conservative Republican appointed chief justice of the United States by President Richard Nixon, wrote in 1990 following his retirement:\nAnd in 1991, Burger stated:\nIn a 1992 opinion piece, six former American attorneys general wrote:\nResearch by Robert Spitzer found that every law journal article discussing the Second Amendment through 1959 \"reflected the Second Amendment affects citizens only in connection with citizen service in a government organized\nand regulated militia.\" Only beginning in 1960 did law journal articles begin to advocate an \"individualist\" view of gun ownership rights. The opposite of this \"individualist\" view of gun ownership rights is the \"collective-right\" theory, according to which the amendment protects a collective right of states to maintain militias or an individual right to keep and bear arms in connection with service in a militia (for this view see for example the quote of Justice John Paul Stevens in the Meaning of \"well regulated militia\" section below). In his book, \"Six Amendments: How and Why We Should Change the Constitution\", Justice John Paul Stevens for example submits the following revised Second Amendment: \"A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms when serving in the militia shall not be infringed.\"\nMeaning of \"well regulated militia\".\nAn early use of the phrase \"well-regulated militia\" may be found in Andrew Fletcher's 1698 \"A Discourse of Government with Relation to Militias\", as well as the phrase \"ordinary and ill-regulated militia\". Fletcher meant \"regular\" in the sense of regular military, and advocated the universal conscription and regular training of men of fighting age. Jefferson thought well of Fletcher, commenting that \"the political principles of that patriot were worthy the purest periods of the British constitution. They are those which were in vigour.\"\nThe term \"regulated\" means \"disciplined\" or \"trained\". In \"Heller\", the U.S. Supreme Court stated that \"[t]he adjective 'well-regulated' implies nothing more than the imposition of proper discipline and training.\"\nIn the year before the drafting of the Second Amendment, in Federalist No. 29 (\"On the Militia\"), Alexander Hamilton wrote the following about \"organizing\", \"disciplining\", \"arming\", and \"training\" of the militia as specified in the enumerated powers:\nJustice Stevens in dissent:\nMeaning of \"the right of the People\".\nJustice Antonin Scalia, writing for the majority in \"Heller\", stated:\nScalia further specifies who holds this right:\nAn earlier case, \"United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez\" (1990), dealt with nonresident aliens and the Fourth Amendment, but led to a discussion of who are \"the People\" when referred to elsewhere in the Constitution:\nAccording to the majority in \"Heller\", there were several different reasons for this amendment, and protecting militias was only one of them; if protecting militias had been the only reason then the amendment could have instead referred to \"the right of the \"militia\" to keep and bear arms\" instead of \"the right of the \"people\" to keep and bear arms\".\nMeaning of \"keep and bear arms\".\nIn \"Heller\" the majority rejected the view that the term \"to bear arms\" implies only the military use of arms:\nIn a dissent, joined by justices Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, Justice Stevens said:\nA May 2018 analysis by Dennis Baron contradicted the majority opinion:\nA paper from 2008 found that before 1820, the use of the phrase \"bear arms\" was commonly used in a civilian context, such as hunting and personal self-defense, in both American and British law. One scholar suggests that the right to \"keep and bear arms\" further includes a right to privately manufacture firearms.\nAnalysis of grammar and syntax.\nThe Second Amendment is viewed by scholars as divided into two clauses, a prefatory clause, and an operative clause.\nThe prefatory clause includes the text:\n\"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,\"\nFollowed by the operative clause:\n\"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\"\nUnder the standard model, the prefatory clause is understood to be merely amplifying the operative clause. The prefatory clause was meant as a non-exclusive example{{snd}}one of many justifications for the Second Amendment. This interpretation is consistent with the position that the Second Amendment protects an individual right.\nUnder the collective right models, the prefatory clause was considered essential as a pre-condition for the main clause. This interpretation claimed that this was a grammar structure common during the era the Second Amendment was written and that this grammar dictated that the Second Amendment protected a collective right to firearms to the extent necessary for militia duty. Many linguistic scholars reject this interpretation of the grammar and syntax, asserting, \"...that the prefatory clause is neither internal nor conditional; instead, it's temporal and external, meaning the opening words introduce its context and purpose.\"\nThe comma between the word \"Arms\" and \"shall\" also has been involved in debate centered around the meaning and interpretation of this one comma between the two words. Some argue that \"...long-standing British tradition minimized punctuation's effect on laws\" and that therefore this comma has little significance on the real meaning of the Second Amendment.\nThe Second Amendment uses \"passive voice\" in its language as opposed to \"active voice.\" Only the First Amendment to the United States Constitution uses \"active voice\" (\"Congress shall make no law\"). Debate around whom the Second Amendment applies to has also centered around this \"passive voice\" used in its wording. A \"Reason\" magazine analysis from January 2025 stated on the subject of the \"passive\" versus \"active\" voice used in the Second Amendment that:The Bill of Rights' passive voice consistently elevates one object: individual rights. As for the subject, the Framers could neither specify nor predict what or who could infringe upon said rights. Thus, the Constitution, especially following the 14th Amendment's ratification, safeguards these rights from an exhaustive catalog of unscrupulous subjects\u2014namely, state actors (e.g., cops, Congress, presidents, judges, city councils, etc.) that could violate these freedoms.\nSupreme Court cases.\nIn the century following the ratification of the Bill of Rights, the intended meaning and application of the Second Amendment drew less interest than it does in modern times.{{full citation needed|date=September 2024|reason=Two works by Saul Cornell are fully cited, with sufficient identifying information, but this one is not.

A notable exception to this general rule was \"Houston v. Moore\", {{ussc|18|1|1820}}, where the U.S. Supreme Court mentioned the Second Amendment in an aside.{{efn|Justice Story \"misidentified\" it as the \"5th Amendment\". Several public officials, including James Madison and Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story, retained the confusing practice of referring to each of the ten amendments in the Bill of Rights by the enumeration found in the first draft; the fifth article is the Second Amendment.}} In the \"Dred Scott\" decision (1857), the opinion of the court stated that if African Americans were considered U.S. citizens, \"It would give to persons of the negro race, who were recognised as citizens in any one State of the Union, the right{{nbsp}}... to keep and carry arms wherever they went.\"\nState and federal courts historically have used two models to interpret the Second Amendment: the \"individual rights\" model, which holds that individuals hold the right to bear arms, and the \"collective rights\" model, which holds that the right is dependent on militia membership. The \"collective rights\" model has been rejected by the Supreme Court, in favor of the individual rights model, beginning with its \"District of Columbia v. Heller (2008)\" decision.\nThe Supreme Court's primary Second Amendment cases include \"United States v. Miller\", (1939); \"District of Columbia v. Heller\" (2008); and \"McDonald v. Chicago\" (2010).\n\"Heller\" and \"McDonald\" supported the individual rights model, under which the Second Amendment protects the right to keep and bear arms much as the First Amendment protects the right to free speech. Under this model, the militia is composed of members who supply their own arms and ammunition. This is generally recognized as the method by which militias have historically been armed, as the Supreme Court in \"Miller\" said:\nOf the collective rights model that holds that the right to arms is based on militia membership, the Supreme Court in \"Heller\" said:\n\"United States v. Cruikshank\".\nIn the Reconstruction Era case of \"United States v. Cruikshank\", {{ussc|92|542|1875}}, the defendants were white men who had killed more than sixty black people in what was known as the Colfax massacre and had been charged with conspiring to prevent blacks from exercising their right to bear arms. The Court dismissed the charges, holding that the Bill of Rights restricted Congress but not private individuals. The Court concluded, \"[f]or their protection in its enjoyment, the people must look to the States.\"\nThe Court stated that \"[t]he Second Amendment{{nbsp}}... has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the national government{{nbsp}}...\" Likewise, the Court held that there was no state action in this case, and therefore the Fourteenth Amendment was not applicable:\nThus, the Court held a federal anti-Ku-Klux-Klan statute to be unconstitutional as applied in that case.\n\"Presser v. Illinois\".\nIn \"Presser v. Illinois\", {{ussc|116|252|1886}}, Herman Presser headed a German-American paramilitary shooting organization and was arrested for leading a parade group of 400 men, training and drilling with military weapons with the declared intention to fight, through the streets of Chicago as a violation of Illinois law that prohibited public drilling and parading in military style without a permit from the governor.\nAt his trial, Presser argued that the State of Illinois had violated his Second Amendment rights. The Supreme Court reaffirmed \"Cruikshank\", and also held that the Second Amendment prevented neither the States nor Congress from barring private militias that parade with arms; such a right \"cannot be claimed as a right independent of law\". This decision upheld the States' authority to regulate the militia and that citizens had no right to create their own militias or to own weapons for semi-military purposes. The Court however observed with respect to the reach of the Amendment on the national government and the federal states and the role of the people therin: \"It is undoubtedly true that all citizens capable of bearing arms constitute the reserved military force or reserve militia of the United States as well as of the states, and, in view of this prerogative of the general government, as well as of its general powers, the states cannot, even laying the constitutional provision in question out of view, prohibit the people from keeping and bearing arms so as to deprive the United States of their rightful resource for maintaining the public security, and disable the people from performing their duty to the general government.\" In essence the court said: \"A state cannot prohibit the people therein from keeping and bearing arms to an extent that would deprive the United States of the protection afforded by them as a reserve military force.\"\n\"Miller v. Texas\".\nIn \"Miller v. Texas\", {{ussc|153|535|1894}}, Franklin Miller was convicted and sentenced to be executed for shooting a police officer to death with an illegally carried handgun in violation of Texas law. Miller sought to have his conviction overturned, claiming his Second Amendment rights were violated and that the Bill of Rights should be applied to state law. The Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment did not apply to state laws such as the Texas law, writing: \"As the proceedings were conducted under the ordinary forms of criminal prosecutions there certainly was no denial of due process of law.\"\n\"Robertson v. Baldwin\".\nIn \"Robertson v. Baldwin\", {{ussc|165|275|1897}}, the Supreme Court stated in \"dicta\" that \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms (Art. II) is not infringed by laws prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons.\"\n\"United States v. Schwimmer\".\n\"United States v. Schwimmer\", {{ussc|279|644|1929}}, concerned a pacifist applicant for naturalization who in the interview declared not to be willing to \"take up arms personally\" in defense of the United States. The Supreme Court cited the Second Amendment indirectly by declaring that the United States Constitution obliges citizens \"to defend our government against all enemies whenever necessity arises is a fundamental principle of the Constitution\" and by declaring further that the \"common defense was one of the purposes for which the people ordained and established the Constitution.\"\n\"United States v. Miller\".\nIn \"United States v. Miller\", {{ussc|307|174|1939}}, the Supreme Court rejected a Second Amendment challenge to the National Firearms Act prohibiting the interstate transportation of unregistered Title II weapons:\nIn a unanimous opinion authored by Justice McReynolds, the Supreme Court stated \"the objection that the Act usurps police power reserved to the States is plainly untenable.\" As the Court explained:\nGun rights advocates claim that the Court in \"Miller\" ruled that the Second Amendment protected the right to keep arms that are part of \"ordinary military equipment\". They also claim that the Court did not consider the question of whether the sawed-off shotgun in the case would be an applicable weapon for personal defense, instead looking solely at the weapon's suitability for the \"common defense\". Law professor Andrew McClurg states, \"The only certainty about \"Miller\" is that it failed to give either side a clear-cut victory. Most modern scholars recognize this fact.\"\n\"District of Columbia v. Heller\".\nJudgment.\nAccording to the syllabus prepared by the U.S. Supreme Court Reporter of Decisions, in \"District of Columbia v. Heller\", {{ussc|554|570|2008}}, the Supreme Court held:\nThe \"Heller\" court also stated (\"Heller\", 554 U.S. 570 (2008), at 632) its analysis should not be read to suggest \"the invalidity of laws regulating the storage of firearms to prevent accidents.\"\nThe Supreme Court also defined the term arms used in the Second Amendment. \"Arms\" covered by the Second Amendment were defined in \"District of Columbia v. Heller\" to include \"any thing that a man wears for his defence, or takes into his hands, or useth in wrath to cast at or strike another\". 554 U. S., at 581.\" The Michigan Court of Appeals 2012 relied on \"Heller\" in the case \"People v. Yanna\" to state certain limitations on the right to keep and bear arms:\nThere are similar legal summaries of the Supreme Court's findings in \"Heller\" as the one quoted above. For example, the Illinois Supreme Court in \"People v. Aguilar\" (2013), summed up \"Heller\"{{'}}s findings and reasoning:\nNotes and analysis.\n\"Heller\" has been widely described as a landmark decision because it was the first time the Court affirmed an individual's right to own a gun. To clarify that its ruling does not invalidate a broad range of existing firearm laws, the majority opinion, written by Justice Antonin Scalia, said:\nThe Court's statement that the right secured by the Second Amendment is limited has been widely discussed by lower courts and the media. According to Justice John Paul Stevens he was able to persuade Justice Anthony M. Kennedy to ask for \"some important changes\" to Justice Scalia's opinion, so it was Justice Kennedy, who was needed to secure a fifth vote in \"Heller\", \"who requested that the opinion include language stating that Heller 'should not be taken to cast doubt' on many existing gun laws.\" The majority opinion also said that the amendment's prefatory clause (referencing the \"militia\") serves to clarify the operative clause (referencing \"the people\"), but does not limit the scope of the operative clause, because \"the 'militia' in colonial America consisted of a subset of 'the people'.{{nbsp}}... \"\nJustice Stevens' dissenting opinion, which was joined by the three other dissenters, said:\nStevens went on to say the following:\nThis dissent called the majority opinion \"strained and unpersuasive\" and said that the right to possess a firearm exists only in relation to the militia and that the D.C. laws constitute permissible regulation. In the majority opinion, Justice Stevens' interpretation of the phrase \"to keep and bear arms\" was referred to as a \"hybrid\" definition that Stevens purportedly chose in order to avoid an \"incoherent\" and \"[g]rotesque\" idiomatic meeting.\nJustice Breyer, in his own dissent joined by Stevens, Souter, and Ginsburg, stated that the entire Court subscribes to the proposition that \"the amendment protects an 'individual' right{{snd}}i.e., one that is separately possessed, and may be separately enforced, by each person on whom it is conferred\".\nRegarding the term \"well regulated\", the majority opinion said, \"The adjective 'well-regulated' implies nothing more than the imposition of proper discipline and training.\" The majority opinion quoted Spooner from \"The Unconstitutionality of Slavery\" as saying that the right to bear arms was necessary for those who wanted to take a stand against slavery. The majority opinion also stated that:\nThe dissenting justices were not persuaded by this argument.\nReaction to \"Heller\" has varied, with many sources giving focus to the ruling referring to itself as being the first in Supreme Court history to read the Second Amendment as protecting an individual right. The majority opinion, authored by Justice Scalia, gives explanation of the majority legal reasoning behind this decision. The majority opinion made clear that the recent ruling did not foreclose the Court's prior interpretations given in \"United States v. Cruikshank\", \"Presser v. Illinois\", and \"United States v. Miller\" though these earlier rulings did not limit the right to keep and bear arms solely to militia purposes, but rather limits the type of weapon to which the right applies to those used by the militia (i.e., those in common use for lawful purposes).\n\"Heller\" pertained to three District of Columbia ordinances involving restrictions on firearms amounting to a total ban. These three ordinances were a ban on handgun registration, a requirement that all firearms in a home be either disassembled or have a trigger lock, and licensing requirement that prohibits carrying an unlicensed firearm in the home, such as from one room to another:\nJustice Ginsburg was a vocal critic of \"Heller\". Speaking in an interview on public radio station WNYC, she called the Second Amendment \"outdated\", saying:\n\"McDonald v. City of Chicago\".\nOn June 28, 2010, the Court in \"McDonald v. City of Chicago\", {{ussc|561|742|2010}}, held that the Second Amendment was incorporated, saying that \"[i]t is clear that the Framers and ratifiers of the Fourteenth Amendment counted the right to keep and bear arms among those fundamental rights necessary to our system of ordered liberty.\" This means that the Court ruled that the Second Amendment limits state and local governments to the same extent that it limits the federal government. It also remanded a case regarding a Chicago handgun prohibition. Four of the five justices in the majority voted to do so by way of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, while the fifth justice, Clarence Thomas, voted to do so through the amendment's Privileges or Immunities Clause. In \"United States v. Rahimi\" (2024) the Supreme Court stated \"that the right to keep and bear arms is among the \u201cfundamental rights necessary to our system of ordered liberty.\u201d \"McDonald v. Chicago\", 561 U. S. 742, 778 (2010).\"\nJustice Thomas, in his concurring opinion, noted that the Privileges or Immunities Clause refers to \"citizens\" whereas the Due Process Clause refers more broadly to any \"person\", and therefore Thomas reserved the issue of non-citizens for later decision. After \"McDonald\", many questions about the Second Amendment remain unsettled, such as whether non-citizens are protected through the Equal Protection Clause.\nIn \"People v. Aguilar\" (2013), the Illinois Supreme Court summed up the central Second Amendment findings in \"McDonald\":\n\"Caetano v. Massachusetts\".\nOn March 21, 2016, in a per curiam decision the Court vacated a Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court decision upholding the conviction of a woman who carried a stun gun for self-defense. The Court reiterated that the \"Heller\" and \"McDonald\" decisions saying that \"the Second Amendment extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that were not in existence at the time of the founding\", that \"the Second Amendment right is fully applicable to the States\", and that the protection is not restricted to \"only those weapons useful in warfare\". The term \"bearable arms\" was defined in \"District of Columbia v. Heller\", 554 U.S. 570 (2008) and includes not only firearms, but any \"[w]eapo[n] of offence\" or \"thing that a man wears for his defence, or takes into his hands\", that is \"carr[ied]{{nbsp}}... for the purpose of offensive or defensive action\". 554 U. S., at 581, 584 (internal quotation marks omitted).\"\n\"New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association, Inc. v. City of New York, New York\".\nThe Court heard \"New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association Inc. v. City of New York, New York\" on December 2, 2019, to decide whether a New York City ordinance that prevents the transport of guns, even if properly unloaded and locked in containers, from within city limits to outside of the city limits is unconstitutional. The New York Rifle &amp; Pistol Association challenged the ordinance on the basis of the Second Amendment, the Dormant Commerce Clause, and the right to travel. However, as the city had changed its rule to allow transport while the case was under consideration by the Court, the Court ruled the case moot in April 2020, though it remanded the case so the lower courts could review the new rules under the petitioners new claims.\n\"New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen\".\nNew York law prohibits the concealed carry of firearms without a permit. The issuance of such permits was previously at the discretion of state authorities, and permits were not issued absent 'proper cause'. The New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association and two individuals who had been denied permits on the grounds that they lacked proper cause, challenged the licensing regime as a violation of the Second Amendment, with the District Court and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in favor of the state. The Supreme Court ruled on June 23, 2022, in a 6\u20133 decision that the New York law, as a \"may-issue\" regulation, was unconstitutional, affirming that public possession of firearms was a protected right under the Second Amendment. The majority stated that states may still regulate firearms through \"shall-issue\" regulations that use objective measures such as background checks. In its June 2024 \"United States v. Rahimi\" decision, the Court refined the \"Bruen\" test, stating that in comparing modern gun control laws to historic tradition, courts should use similar analogues and general principles rather than strict matches.\nUnited States Courts of Appeals decisions before and after \"Heller\".\nBefore \"Heller\".\nUntil \"District of Columbia v. Heller\" (2008), \"United States v. Miller\" (1939) had been the only Supreme Court decision that \"tested a congressional enactment against [the Second Amendment]\". \"Miller\" did not directly mention either a collective or individual right, but for the 62-year period from \"Miller\" until the Fifth Circuit's decision in \"United States v. Emerson\" (2001), federal courts recognized only the collective right, with \"courts increasingly referring to one another's holdings{{nbsp}}... without engaging in any appreciably substantive legal analysis of the issue\".\n\"Emerson\" changed this by addressing the question in depth, with the Fifth Circuit determining that the Second Amendment protects an individual right. Subsequently, the Ninth Circuit conflicted with \"Emerson\" in \"Silveira v. Lockyer\", and the D.C. Circuit supported \"Emerson\" in \"Parker v. District of Columbia\". \"Parker\" evolved into \"District of Columbia v. Heller\", in which the U.S. Supreme Court determined that the Second Amendment protects an individual right.\nAfter \"Heller\".\nSince \"Heller\", the United States courts of appeals have ruled on many Second Amendment challenges to convictions and gun control laws."}
{"id": "31656", "revid": "28760036", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31656", "title": "Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution", "text": "1791 amendment prohibiting unreasonable searches and seizures\nThe Fourth Amendment (Amendment IV) to the United States Constitution is part of the Bill of Rights. It prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures and sets requirements for issuing warrants: warrants must be issued by a judge or magistrate, justified by probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and must particularly describe the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized (important or not).\nFourth Amendment case law deals with three main issues: what government activities are \"searches\" and \"seizures\", what constitutes probable cause to conduct searches and seizures, and how to address violations of Fourth Amendment rights. Early court decisions limited the amendment's scope to physical intrusion of property or persons, but with \"Katz v. United States\" (1967), the Supreme Court held that its protections extend to intrusions on the privacy of individuals as well as to physical locations. A warrant is needed for most search and seizure activities, but the Court has carved out a series of exceptions for consent searches, motor vehicle searches, evidence in plain view, exigent circumstances, border searches, and other situations.\nThe exclusionary rule is one way the amendment is enforced. Established in \"Weeks v. United States\" (1914), this rule holds that evidence obtained as a result of a Fourth Amendment violation is generally inadmissible at criminal trials. Evidence discovered as a later result of an illegal search may also be inadmissible as \"fruit of the poisonous tree\". The exception is if it inevitably would have been discovered by legal means.\nThe Fourth Amendment was introduced in Congress in 1789 by James Madison, along with the other amendments in the Bill of Rights, in response to Anti-Federalist objections to the new Constitution. Congress submitted the amendment to the states on September 28, 1789. By December 15, 1791, the necessary three-fourths of the states had ratified it. On March 1, 1792, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson announced that it was officially part of the Constitution.\nBecause the Bill of Rights did not initially apply to state or local governments, and federal criminal investigations were less common in the first century of the nation's history, there is little significant case law for the Fourth Amendment before the 20th century. The amendment was held to apply to state and local governments in \"Mapp v. Ohio\" (1961) via the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nText.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\nBackground.\nEnglish law.\nLike many other areas of American law, the Fourth Amendment finds its origin in English legal doctrine. In \"Semayne's case\" (1604), Sir Edward Coke stated: \"The house of every one is to him as his castle and fortress, as well for his defence against injury and violence as for his repose.\" \"Semayne's Case\" acknowledged that the King did not have unbridled authority to intrude on his subjects' dwellings, but recognized that government agents were permitted to conduct searches and seizures under certain conditions when their purpose was lawful and a warrant had been obtained.\nThe 1760s saw a growth in the intensity of litigation against state officers, who were using general warrants, conducted raids in search of materials relating to John Wilkes's publications. The most famous of these cases involved John Entick whose home was forcibly entered by the King's Messenger Nathan Carrington, along with others, pursuant to a warrant issued by George Montagu-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax authorizing them \"to make strict and diligent search for\u00a0... the author, or one concerned in the writing of several weekly very seditious papers entitled, ', No 257, 357, 358, 360, 373, 376, 378, and 380'\", the search resulting in seizure of printed charts, pamphlets and other materials. Entick filed suit in \"Entick v Carrington\", argued before the Court of King's Bench in 1765. Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden ruled that both the search and the seizure were unlawful, as the warrant authorized the seizure of \"all\" of Entick's papers\u2014not just the criminal ones\u2014and as the warrant lacked probable cause to even justify the search. By holding that \"[O]ur law holds the property of every man so sacred, that no man can set his foot upon his neighbour's close without his leave\", \"Entick\" established the English precedent that the executive is limited in intruding on private property by common law.\nColonial America.\nHomes in Colonial America, on the other hand, did not enjoy the same sanctity as their British counterparts, because legislation had been explicitly written so as to enable enforcement of British revenue-gathering policies on customs; until 1750, in fact, the only type of warrant defined in the handbooks for justices of the peace was the general warrant. During what scholar William Cuddihy called the \"colonial epidemic of general searches\", the authorities possessed almost unlimited power to search for anything at any time, with very little oversight.\nIn 1756, the colony of Massachusetts barred the use of general warrants. This represented the first law in American history curtailing the use of seizure power. Its creation largely stemmed from the great public outcry over the Excise Act of 1754, which gave tax collectors unlimited powers to interrogate colonists concerning their use of goods subject to customs. The act also permitted the use of a general warrant known as a writ of assistance, allowing tax collectors to search the homes of colonists and seize \"prohibited and uncustomed\" goods.\nA crisis erupted over the writs of assistance on December 27, 1760, when the news of King George II's death on October 23 arrived in Boston. All writs automatically expired six months after the death of the King, and would have had to be re-issued by George III, the new king, to remain valid.\nIn mid-January 1761, a group of more than fifty merchants represented by James Otis petitioned the court to have hearings on the issue. During the five-hour hearing on February 23, 1761, Otis vehemently denounced British colonial policies, including their sanction of general warrants and writs of assistance. However, the court ruled against Otis. Future President John Adams, who was present in the courtroom when Otis spoke, viewed these events as \"the spark in which originated the American Revolution\".\nBecause of the name he had made for himself in attacking the writs, Otis was elected to the Massachusetts colonial legislature and helped pass legislation requiring that special writs of assistance be \"granted by any judge or justice of the peace upon information under oath by any officer of the customs\" and barring all other writs. The governor overturned the legislation, finding it contrary to English law and parliamentary sovereignty.\nSeeing the danger general warrants presented, the Virginia Declaration of Rights (1776) explicitly forbade the use of general warrants. This prohibition became a precedent for the Fourth Amendment:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;That general warrants, whereby any officer or messenger may be commanded to search suspected places without evidence of a fact committed, or to seize any person or persons not named, or whose offense is not particularly described and supported by evidence, are grievous and oppressive and ought not to be granted.\nArticle XIV of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, written by John Adams and enacted in 1780 as part of the Massachusetts Constitution, added the requirement that all searches must be \"reasonable\", and served as another basis for the language of the Fourth Amendment:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Every subject has a right to be secure from all unreasonable searches, and seizures of his person, his houses, his papers, and all his possessions. All warrants, therefore, are contrary to this right, if the cause or foundation of them be not previously supported by oath or affirmation; and if the order in the warrant to a civil officer, to make search in suspected places, or to arrest one or more suspected persons, or to seize their property, be not accompanied with a special designation of the persons or objects of search, arrest, or seizure: and no warrant ought to be issued but in cases, and with the formalities, prescribed by the laws.\nBy 1784, eight state constitutions contained a provision against general warrants.\nProposal and ratification.\nAfter several years of comparatively weak government under the Articles of Confederation, a Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia proposed a new constitution on September 17, 1787, featuring a stronger chief executive and other changes. George Mason, a Constitutional Convention delegate and the drafter of Virginia's Declaration of Rights, proposed that a bill of rights listing and guaranteeing civil liberties be included. Other delegates\u2014including future Bill of Rights drafter James Madison\u2014disagreed, arguing that existing state guarantees of civil liberties were sufficient and that any attempt to enumerate individual rights risked implying that other, unnamed rights were unprotected. After a brief debate, Mason's proposal was defeated by a unanimous vote of the state delegations.\nFor the Constitution to be ratified, nine of the thirteen states were required to approve it in state conventions. Opposition to ratification (\"Anti-Federalism\") was partly based on the Constitution's lack of adequate guarantees for civil liberties. Supporters of the Constitution in states where popular sentiment was against ratification (including Virginia, Massachusetts, and New York) successfully proposed that their state conventions both ratify the Constitution and call for the addition of a bill of rights. Four state conventions proposed some form of restriction on the authority of the new federal government to conduct searches.\nIn the 1st United States Congress, following the state legislatures' request, James Madison proposed twenty constitutional amendments based on state bills of rights and English sources such as the Bill of Rights 1689, including an amendment requiring probable cause for government searches. Congress reduced Madison's proposed twenty amendments to twelve, with modifications to Madison's language about searches and seizures. The final language was submitted to the states for ratification on September 25, 1789.\nBy the time the Bill of Rights was submitted to the states for ratification, opinions had shifted in both parties. Many Federalists, who had previously opposed a Bill of Rights, now supported the Bill as a means of silencing the Anti-Federalists' most effective criticism. Many Anti-Federalists, in contrast, now opposed it, realizing the Bill's adoption would greatly lessen the chances of a second constitutional convention, which they desired. Anti-Federalists such as Richard Henry Lee also argued that the Bill left the most objectionable portions of the Constitution, such as the federal judiciary and direct taxation, intact.\nOn November 20, 1789, New Jersey ratified eleven of the twelve amendments, including the Fourth. On December 19, 1789, December 22, 1789, and January 19, 1790, respectively, Maryland, North Carolina, and South Carolina ratified all twelve amendments. On January 25 and 28, 1790, respectively, New Hampshire and Delaware ratified eleven of the Bill's twelve amendments, including the Fourth. This brought the total of ratifying states to six of the required ten, but the process stalled in other states: Connecticut and Georgia found a Bill of Rights unnecessary and so refused to ratify, while Massachusetts ratified most of the amendments, but failed to send official notice to the Secretary of State that it had done so (all three states would later ratify the Bill of Rights for sesquicentennial celebrations in 1939).\nIn February through June 1790, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island each ratified eleven of the amendments, including the Fourth. Virginia initially postponed its debate, but after Vermont was admitted to the Union in 1791, the total number of states needed for ratification rose to eleven. Vermont ratified on November 3, 1791, approving all twelve amendments, and Virginia finally followed on December 15, 1791. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson announced the adoption of the ten successfully ratified amendments on March 1, 1792.\nApplicability.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe point of the Fourth Amendment, which often is not grasped by zealous officers, is not that it denies law enforcement the support of the usual inferences which reasonable men draw from evidence. Its protection consists in requiring that those inferences be drawn by a neutral and detached magistrate instead of being judged by the officer engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime. Any assumption that evidence sufficient to support a magistrate's disinterested determination to issue a search warrant will justify the officers in making a search without a warrant would reduce the Amendment to a nullity, and leave the people's homes secure only in the discretion of police officers. Crime, even in the privacy of one's own quarters, is, of course, of grave concern to society, and the law allows such crime to be reached on proper showing. The right of officers to thrust themselves into a home is also a grave concern, not only to the individual, but to a society which chooses to dwell in reasonable security and freedom from surveillance. When the right of privacy must reasonably yield to the right of search is, as a rule, to be decided by a judicial officer, not by a policeman or government enforcement agent.\n--Justice Robert H. Jackson in the Opinion of the Court in \"Johnson v. United States\" (1948).\nThe Fourth Amendment, and the personal rights which it secures, have a long history. The Bill of Rights originally restricted only the federal government, and went through a long initial phase of \"judicial dormancy;\" in the words of historian Gordon S.\u00a0Wood, \"After ratification, most Americans promptly forgot about the first ten amendments to the Constitution.\" Federal jurisdiction regarding criminal law was narrow until the late 19th century when the Interstate Commerce Act and Sherman Antitrust Act were passed. As federal criminal jurisdiction expanded to include other areas such as narcotics, more questions about the Fourth Amendment came to the U.S. Supreme Court. In Hale v. Henkel (1906), the Supreme Court applied the Fourth Amendment to corporations, protecting corporate records from search and seizure. The Supreme Court responded to these questions by stating on the one hand that the government powers to search and seizure are limited by the Fourth Amendment so that arbitrary and oppressive interference by enforcement officials with the privacy and personal security of individuals are prevented and by outlining on the other hand the fundamental purpose of the amendment as guaranteeing \"the privacy, dignity and security of persons against certain arbitrary and invasive acts by officers of the Government, without regard to whether the government actor is investigating crime or performing another function\". To protect personal privacy and dignity against unwarranted intrusion by the State is the overriding function of the Fourth Amendment according to the Court in \"Schmerber v. California\" (1966), because \"[t]he security of one's privacy against arbitrary intrusion by the police\" is \"at the core of the Fourth Amendment\" and \"basic to a free society\". Pointing to historic precedents like \"Entick v Carrington\" (1765) and \"Boyd v. United States\" (1886), the Supreme Court held in \"Silverman v. United States\" (1961) that the Fourth Amendments core is the right to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion. The Supreme Court declared in \"Berger v. New York\" (1967) that the Fourth Amendment's protections include \"conversation\" and is not limited to \"persons, houses, papers, and effects\". The New York Court of Appeals observed in 1975: \"The basic purpose of the constitutional protections against unlawful searches and seizures is to safeguard the privacy and security of each and every person against all arbitrary intrusions by government. Therefore, any time an intrusion on the security and privacy of the individual is undertaken with intent to harass or is based upon mere whim, caprice or idle curiosity, the spirit of the Constitution has been violated and the aggrieved party may invoke the exclusionary rule or appropriate forms of civil redress.\" With a view to \"Camara v. Municipal Court\" (1967) the Supreme Court observed in \"Torres v. Madrid\" (2021) that the focus of the Fourth Amendment is the privacy and security of individuals, not the particular manner of arbitrary invasion by governmental officials. In \"Mapp v. Ohio\" (1961), the Supreme Court ruled that the Fourth Amendment applies to the states by way of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe effect of the Fourth Amendment is to put the courts of the United States and Federal officials, in the exercise of their power and authority, under limitations and restraints as to the exercise of such power and authority, and to forever secure the people, their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against all unreasonable searches and seizures under the guise of law. This protection reaches all alike, whether accused of crime or not, and the duty of giving to it force and effect is obligatory upon all intrusted under our Federal system with the enforcement of the laws. The tendency of those who execute the criminal laws of the country to obtain conviction by means of unlawful seizures and enforced confessions, the latter often obtained after subjecting accused persons to unwarranted practices destructive of rights secured by the Federal Constitution, should find no sanction in the judgments of the courts, which are charged at all times with the support of the Constitution, and to which people of all conditions have a right to appeal for the maintenance of such fundamental rights.\n--Justice William R. Day in the Opinion of the Court in \"Weeks v. United States\" (1914).\nFourth Amendment case law deals with three central issues: what government activities constitute \"search\" and \"seizure;\" what constitutes probable cause for these actions; how violations of Fourth Amendment rights should be addressed. The text of the amendment is brief, and most of the law determining what constitutes an unlawful search and seizure is found in court rulings. The brief definitions of the terms \"search\" and \"seizure\" was concisely summarized in \"United States v. Jacobsen\", which said that the Fourth Amendment:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;protects two types of expectations, one involving \"searches\", the other \"seizures\". A \"search\" occurs when an expectation of privacy that society is prepared to consider reasonable is infringed. A \"seizure\" of property occurs where there is some meaningful interference with an individual's possessory interests in that property.\n\"The Fourth Amendment search and seizure doctrine involves a complex compromise between public safety and the constitutional right to personal liberty.\" The Fourth Amendment typically requires \"a neutral and detached authority interposed between the police and the public\", and it is offended by \"general warrants\" and laws that allow searches to be conducted \"indiscriminately and without regard to their connection with [a] crime under investigation\", for the \"basic purpose of the Fourth Amendment, which is enforceable against the States through the Fourteenth, through its prohibition of 'unreasonable' searches and seizures is to safeguard the privacy and security of individuals against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials\".\nThe Fourth Amendment has been held to mean that a search or an arrest generally requires a judicially sanctioned warrant, because the basic rule under the Fourth Amendment is that arrests and \"searches conducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are \"per se\" unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment\u2014subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions\". In order for such a warrant to be considered reasonable, it must be supported by probable cause and be limited in scope according to specific information supplied by a person (usually a law enforcement officer) who has sworn by it and is therefore accountable to the issuing court. Where there was no clear practice, either approving or disapproving the type of search at issue, at the time the constitutional provision was enacted, the \"reasonableness\" of a search is judged by balancing the intrusion on the individual's Fourth Amendment interests against the promotion of legitimate governmental interests. The Supreme Court further held in \"Chandler v. Miller\" (1997): \"To be reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, a search ordinarily must be based on individualized suspicion of wrongdoing. But particularized exceptions to the main rule are sometimes warranted based on 'special needs, beyond the normal need for law enforcement'.\u00a0... When such 'special needs' are alleged, courts must undertake a context-specific inquiry, examining closely the competing private and public interests advanced by the parties.\" The reasonableness of any particular search and seizure according to the Supreme Court in \"Terry v. Ohio\" (1968) must be assessed in light of the particular circumstances against the standard of whether a man of reasonable caution is warranted in believing that the action taken was appropriate. The amendment applies to governmental searches and seizures, but not those done by private citizens or organizations who are not acting on behalf of a government. In \"Ontario v. Quon\" (2010), the Court applied the amendment to a municipal government in its capacity as an employer, ruling that the City of Ontario had not violated the Fourth Amendment rights of city police officers by obtaining from the communications company and reviewing transcripts of text messages sent using government-provided pagers.\nSearch.\nOne threshold question in the Fourth Amendment jurisprudence is whether a \"search\" has occurred. Initial Fourth Amendment case law hinged on a citizen's property rights\u2014that is, when the government physically intrudes on \"persons, houses, papers, or effects\" for the purpose of obtaining information, a \"search\" within the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment, has occurred. Early 20th-century Court decisions, such as \"Olmstead v. United States\" (1928), held that Fourth Amendment rights applied in cases of physical intrusion, but not to other forms of police surveillance (e.g., wiretaps). In \"Silverman v. United States\" (1961), the Court stated of the amendment that \"at the very core stands the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion\".\nFourth Amendment protections expanded significantly with \"Katz v. United States\" (1967). In \"Katz\", the Supreme Court expanded that focus to embrace an individual's right to privacy, and ruled that a search had occurred when the government wiretapped a telephone booth using a microphone attached to the outside of the glass. While there was no physical intrusion into the booth, the Court reasoned that: 1) Katz, by entering the booth and shutting the door behind him, had exhibited his expectation that \"the words he utters into the mouthpiece will not be broadcast to the world\"; and 2) society believes that his expectation was reasonable. Justice Potter Stewart wrote in the majority opinion that \"the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places\". A \"search\" occurs for purposes of the Fourth Amendment when the government violates a person's \"reasonable expectation of privacy\". Katz's reasonable expectation of privacy thus provided the basis to rule that the government's intrusion, though electronic rather than physical, was a search covered by the Fourth Amendment, and thus necessitated a warrant. The Court said it was not recognizing any general right to privacy in the Fourth Amendment, and that this wiretap could have been authorized if proper procedures had been followed.\nThis decision in \"Katz\" was later developed into the now commonly used two-prong test, adopted in \"Smith v. Maryland\" (1979), for determining whether a search has occurred for purposes of the Fourth Amendment:\nThe Supreme Court has held that the Fourth Amendment does not apply to information that is voluntarily shared with third parties. In \"Smith\", the Court held individuals have no \"legitimate expectation of privacy\" regarding the telephone numbers they dial because they knowingly give that information to telephone companies when they dial a number. However, under \"Carpenter v. United States\" (2018), individuals have a reasonable expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment regarding cell phone records even though they themselves turned over that information to \"third parties\" (i.e. the cell phone companies). Prior to the Carpenter ruling, law enforcement was able to retrieve cell site location information (CSLI) that included where a cell phone user had traveled over many months and with which other cell phone users they had associated. Carpenter v. United States serves as a landmark case because it slightly narrowed the Third Party Doctrine, thus requiring law enforcement to first obtain a search warrant before receiving CSLI records. \"In the 5-4 [Carpenter] decision, the Court ruled 'narrowly' in favor of privacy, finding the government had constitutionally violated Mr. Carpenter's reasonable expectation of privacy by acquiring this private information without a warrant.\"\nFollowing \"Katz\", the vast majority of Fourth Amendment search cases have turned on the right to privacy, but in \"United States v. Jones\" (2012), the Court ruled that the \"Katz\" standard did not replace earlier case law, but rather, has supplemented it. In \"Jones\", law enforcement officers had attached a GPS device on a car's exterior without Jones' knowledge or consent. The Court concluded that Jones was a bailee to the car, and so had a property interest in the car. Therefore, since the intrusion on the vehicle\u2014a common law trespass\u2014was for the purpose of obtaining information, the Court ruled that it was a search under the Fourth Amendment. The Court used similar \"trespass\" reasoning in \"Florida v. Jardines\" (2013), to rule that bringing a drug detection dog to sniff at the front door of a home was a search.\nIn many situations, law enforcement may perform a search when they have a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, even if it falls short of probable cause necessary for an arrest. Under \"Terry v. Ohio\" (1968), law enforcement officers are permitted to conduct a limited warrantless search on a level of suspicion less than probable cause under certain circumstances. In \"Terry\", the Supreme Court ruled that when a police officer witnesses \"unusual conduct\" that leads the officer to reasonably believe \"that criminal activity may be afoot\", that the suspicious person has a weapon \"and\" that the person is presently dangerous to the officer or others, the officer may conduct a pat-down search (\"frisk\" the person) to determine whether the person is carrying a weapon. This detention and search is known as a \"Terry\" stop. To conduct a frisk, officers must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant their actions. As established in \"Florida v. Royer\" (1983), such a search must be temporary, and questioning must be limited to the purpose of the stop (e.g., officers who stop a person because they have reasonable suspicion to believe the person was driving a stolen car, cannot, after confirming it is not stolen, compel the person to answer questions about anything else, such as contraband).\nSeizure.\nThe Fourth Amendment also protects \"[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable\u00a0... seizures\". A seizure of property occurs when there is \"some meaningful interference with an individual's possessory interests in that property\", such as when police officers take personal property away from an owner to use as evidence, or when they participate in an eviction. The amendment also protects against unreasonable seizure of persons, including a brief detention.\nA seizure does not occur just because the government questions an individual in a public place. The exclusionary rule would not bar voluntary answers to such questions from being offered into evidence in a subsequent criminal prosecution. The person is not being seized if his freedom of movement is not restrained. The government may not detain an individual even momentarily without reasonable, objective grounds, with few exceptions. His refusal to listen or answer does not by itself furnish such grounds.\nIn \"United States v. Mendenhall\" (1980), the Court held that a person is seized only when, by means of physical force \"or\" show of authority, his freedom of movement is restrained and, in the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would believe he was not free to leave. Under \"Torres v. Madrid\" (2021), a person is considered to be seized following the use of physical force with the intent to restrain, even if the person manages to escape. In \"Florida v. Bostick\" (1991), the Court ruled that as long as the police do not convey a message that compliance with their requests is required, the police contact is a \"citizen encounter\" that falls outside the protections of the Fourth Amendment. If a person remains free to disregard questioning by the government, there has been no seizure and therefore no intrusion upon the person's privacy under the Fourth Amendment.\nWhen a person is arrested and taken into police custody, he has been seized (i.e., a reasonable person who is handcuffed and placed in the back of a police car would not think they were free to leave). A person subjected to a routine traffic stop on the other hand, has been seized, but is not \"arrested\" because traffic stops are a relatively brief encounter and are more analogous to a \"Terry\" stop than to a formal arrest. If a person is not under suspicion of illegal behavior, a law enforcement official is not allowed to place an individual under arrest simply because this person does not wish to state his identity, provided specific state regulations do not specify this to be the case. A search incidental to an arrest that is not permissible under state law does not violate the Fourth Amendment, so long as the arresting officer has probable cause. In \"Maryland v. King\" (2013), the Court upheld the constitutionality of police swabbing for DNA upon arrests for serious crimes, along the same reasoning that allows police to take fingerprints or photographs of those they arrest and detain.\nExceptions.\nThe government may not detain an individual even momentarily without reasonable and articulable suspicion, with a few exceptions. In \"Delaware v. Prouse\" (1979), the Court ruled an officer has made an illegal seizure when he stops an automobile and detains the driver in order to check his driver's license and the registration of the automobile, because the officer does not have articulable and reasonable suspicion that a motorist is unlicensed or that an automobile is not registered, or either the vehicle or an occupant is otherwise subject to seizure for violation of law.\nWhere society's need is great, no other effective means of meeting the need is available, and intrusion on people's privacy is minimal, certain discretionless checkpoints toward that end may briefly detain motorists. In \"United States v. Martinez-Fuerte\" (1976), the Supreme Court allowed discretionless immigration checkpoints. In \"Michigan Dept. of State Police v. Sitz\" (1990), the Supreme Court allowed discretionless sobriety checkpoints. In \"Illinois v. Lidster\" (2004), the Supreme Court allowed focused informational checkpoints. However, in \"City of Indianapolis v. Edmond\" (2000), the Supreme Court ruled that discretionary checkpoints or general crime-fighting checkpoints are not allowed.\nWarrant.\nUnder the Fourth Amendment, law enforcement must receive written permission from a court of law, or otherwise qualified magistrate, to lawfully search and seize evidence while investigating criminal activity. A court grants permission by issuing a writ known as a warrant. A search or seizure is generally unreasonable and unconstitutional if conducted without a valid warrant and the police must obtain a warrant whenever practicable. Searches and seizures without a warrant are not considered unreasonable if one of the specifically established and well-delineated exceptions to the warrant requirement applies. These exceptions apply \"[o]nly in those exceptional circumstances in which special needs, beyond the normal need for law enforcement, make the warrant and probable cause requirement impracticable\". In Marshall v. Barlow's, Inc., the Supreme Court ruled that OSHA needed probable cause to inspect a business.\nIn these situations where the warrant requirement doesn't apply a search or seizure nonetheless must be justified by some individualized suspicion of wrongdoing. However, the U.S. Supreme Court carved out an exception to the requirement of individualized suspicion. It ruled that, \"In limited circumstances, where the privacy interests implicated by the search are minimal and where an important governmental interest furthered by the intrusion would be placed in jeopardy by a requirement of individualized suspicion\" a search [or seizure] would still be reasonable.\nProbable cause.\nThe Supreme Court in \"Berger v. New York\" (1967) explained that the purpose of the probable cause requirement of the Fourth Amendment is to keep the state out of constitutionally protected areas until it has reason to believe that a specific crime has been or is being committed. The standards of probable cause differ for an arrest and a search. The government has probable cause to make an arrest when \"the facts and circumstances within their knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information\" would lead a prudent person to believe the arrested person had committed or was committing a crime. Probable cause to arrest must exist before the arrest is made. Evidence obtained after the arrest may not apply retroactively to justify the arrest.\nWhen police conduct a search, the amendment requires that the warrant establish probable cause to believe the search will uncover criminal activity or contraband. They must have legally sufficient reasons to believe a search is necessary. In \"Carroll v. United States\" (1925), the Supreme Court stated that probable cause to search is a flexible, common-sense standard. To that end, the Court ruled in \"Dumbra v. United States\" (1925) that the term probable cause means \"less than evidence that would justify condemnation\", reiterating \"Carroll\"'s assertion that it merely requires that the facts available to the officer would \"warrant a man of reasonable caution\" in the belief that specific items may be contraband or stolen property or useful as evidence of a crime. It does not demand any showing that such a belief be correct or more likely true than false. A \"practical, non-technical\" probability that incriminating evidence is involved is all that is required. In \"Illinois v. Gates\" (1983), the Court ruled that the reliability of an informant is to be determined based on the \"totality of the circumstances\".\nExceptions to the warrant requirement.\nConsent.\nIf a party gives consent to a search, a warrant is not required. There are exceptions and complications to the rule, including the scope of the consent given, whether the consent is voluntarily given, and whether an individual has the right to consent to a search of another's property. In \"Schneckloth v. Bustamonte\" (1973), the Court ruled that a consent search is still valid even if the police do not inform a suspect of his right to refuse the search. This contrasts with Fifth Amendment rights, which cannot be relinquished without an explicit \"Miranda\" warning from police.\nThe Court stated in \"United States v. Matlock\" (1974) that a third party co-occupant could give consent for a search without violating a suspect's Fourth Amendment rights. However, in \"Georgia v. Randolph\" (2006), the Supreme Court ruled that when two co-occupants are both present, one consenting and the other rejecting the search of a shared residence, the police may not make a search of that residence within the consent exception to the warrant requirement. Per the Court's ruling in \"Illinois v. Rodriguez\" (1990), a consent search is still considered valid if police accept in good faith the consent of an \"apparent authority\", even if that party is later discovered to not have authority over the property in question. A telling case on this subject is \"Stoner v. California\", in which the Court held that police officers could not rely in good faith upon the apparent authority of a hotel clerk to consent to the search of a guest's room.\nPlain view and open fields.\nAccording to the plain view doctrine as defined in \"Coolidge v. New Hampshire\" (1971), if an officer is lawfully present, he may seize objects that are in \"plain view\". However, the officer must have had probable cause to believe the objects are contraband, and the criminality of the object in plain view must be obvious by its very nature. In \"Arizona v. Hicks\", the Supreme Court held that an officer stepped beyond the plain view doctrine when he moved a turntable in order to view its serial number to confirm that the turntable was stolen. \"A search is a search,\" proclaimed the Court, \"even if it happens to disclose nothing but the bottom of a turntable.\"\nSimilarly, \"open fields\" such as pastures, open water, and woods may be searched without a warrant, on the ground that conduct occurring therein would have no reasonable expectation of privacy. The doctrine was first articulated by the Court in \"Hester v. United States\" (1924), which stated that \"the special protection accorded by the Fourth Amendment to the people in their 'persons, houses, papers, and effects' is not extended to the open fields\".\nIn \"Oliver v. United States\" (1984), the police ignored a \"no trespassing\" sign and a fence, trespassed onto the suspect's land without a warrant, followed a path for hundreds of feet, and discovered a field of marijuana. The Supreme Court ruled that no search had taken place, because there was no privacy expectation regarding an open field:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;open fields do not provide the setting for those intimate activities that the Amendment is intended to shelter from government interference or surveillance. There is no societal interest in protecting the privacy of those activities, such as the cultivation of crops, that occur in open fields.\nAccording to a 2024 study, at least 96% of all private land in the country, about 1.2 billion acres, qualify as unprotected open fields under current Fourth Amendment law. \nWhile open fields are not protected by the Fourth Amendment, the curtilage, or outdoor area immediately surrounding the home, is protected. Courts have treated this area as an extension of the house and as such subject to all the privacy protections afforded a person's home (unlike a person's open fields) under the Fourth Amendment. The curtilage is \"intimately linked to the home, both physically and psychologically\", and is where \"privacy expectations are most heightened\". However, courts have held aerial surveillance of curtilage not to be included in the protections from unwarranted search so long as the airspace above the curtilage is generally accessible by the public. An area is curtilage if it \"harbors the intimate activity associated with the sanctity of a man's home and the privacies of life\". Courts make this determination by examining \"whether the area is included within an enclosure surrounding the home, the nature of the uses to which the area is put, and the steps taken by the resident to protect the area from observation by people passing by\". The Court has acknowledged that a doorbell or knocker is typically treated as an invitation, or license, to the public to approach the front door of the home to deliver mail, sell goods, solicit for charities, etc. This license extends to the police, who have the right to try engaging a home's occupant in a \"knock and talk\" for the purpose of gathering evidence without a warrant. However, they cannot bring a drug detection dog to sniff at the front door of a home without either a warrant or consent of the homeowner or resident.\nMoreover, several state courts have rejected the open fields doctrine under their own state constitutional search-and-seizure provisions. Moreover, several of these decisions have been reaffirmed over time.\nExigent circumstance.\nLaw enforcement officers may also conduct warrantless searches in several types of exigent circumstances where obtaining a warrant is dangerous or impractical. Under \"Terry v. Ohio\" (1968) police are permitted to frisk suspects for weapons. The Court also allowed a search of arrested persons in \"Weeks v. United States\" (1914) to preserve evidence that might otherwise be destroyed and to ensure suspects were disarmed. In \"Carroll v. United States\" (1925), the Court ruled that law enforcement officers could search a vehicle that they suspected of carrying contraband without a warrant. The Court allowed blood to be drawn without a warrant from drunk-driving suspects in \"Schmerber v. California\" (1966) on the grounds that the time to obtain a warrant would allow a suspect's blood alcohol content to reduce, although this was later modified by \"Missouri v. McNeely\" (2013). \"Warden v. Hayden\" (1967) provided an exception to the warrant requirement if officers were in \"hot pursuit\" of a suspect.\nA subset of exigent circumstances is the debated community caretaking exception.\nMotor vehicle.\nThe Supreme Court has held that individuals in automobiles have a reduced expectation of privacy, because (1) vehicles generally do not serve as residences or repositories of personal effects, and (2) vehicles \"can be quickly moved out of the locality or jurisdiction in which the warrant must be sought\". Vehicles may not be randomly stopped and searched; there must be probable cause or reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Items in plain view may be seized; areas that could potentially hide weapons may also be searched. With probable cause to believe evidence is present, police officers may search any area in the vehicle. However, they may not extend the search to the vehicle's passengers without probable cause to search those passengers or consent from the passengers. In \"Collins v. Virginia\" (2018), the Court ruled that the motor vehicle exception did not apply to searches of vehicles parked within a residence's curtilage.\nIn \"Arizona v. Gant\" (2009), the Court ruled that a law enforcement officer needs a warrant before searching a motor vehicle after an arrest of an occupant of that vehicle, unless 1) at the time of the search the person being arrested is unsecured and within reaching distance of the passenger compartment of the vehicle or 2) police officers have reason to believe evidence for the crime for which the person is being arrested will be found in the vehicle.\nSearches incident to a lawful arrest.\nA common law rule from Great Britain permits searches incident to an arrest without a warrant. This rule has been applied in American law, and has a lengthy common law history. The justification for such a search is to prevent the arrested individual 1.) from destroying evidence or 2.) using a weapon against the arresting officer by disarming the suspect. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that \"both justifications for the search-incident-to-arrest exception are absent and the rule does not apply\" when \"there is no possibility\" the suspect could gain access to a weapon or destroy evidence. In \"Trupiano v. United States\" (1948), the Supreme Court held that \"a search or seizure without a warrant as an incident to a lawful arrest has always been considered to be a strictly limited right. It grows out of the inherent necessities of the situation at the time of the arrest. But there must be something more in the way of necessity than merely a lawful arrest.\" In \"United States v. Rabinowitz\" (1950), the Court reversed \"Trupiano\", holding instead that the officers' opportunity to obtain a warrant was not germane to the reasonableness of a search incident to an arrest. \"Rabinowitz\" suggested that any area within the \"immediate control\" of the arrestee could be searched, but it did not define the term. In deciding \"Chimel v. California\" (1969), the Supreme Court elucidated its previous decisions. It held that when an arrest is made, it is reasonable for the officer to search the arrestee for weapons and evidence. However, in \"Riley v. California\" (2014), the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that police must obtain a warrant to search an arrestee's cellular phone. The Court said that earlier Supreme Court decisions permitting searches incident to an arrest without a warrant do not apply to \"modern cellphones, which are now such a pervasive and insistent part of daily life that the proverbial visitor from Mars might conclude they were an important feature of human anatomy\" and noted that U.S. citizens' cellphones today typically contain \"a digital record of nearly every aspect of their lives\u2014from the mundane to the intimate\".\nBorder search exception.\nSearches conducted at the United States border or the equivalent of the border (such as an international airport) may be conducted without a warrant or probable cause subject to the border search exception. Most border searches may be conducted entirely at random, without any level of suspicion, pursuant to U.S. Customs and Border Protection plenary search authority. However, searches that intrude upon a traveler's personal dignity and privacy interests, such as strip and body cavity searches, must be supported by \"reasonable suspicion\". The U.S. Courts of Appeals for the Fourth and Ninth circuits have ruled that information on a traveler's electronic materials, including personal files on a laptop computer, may be searched at random, without suspicion.\nForeign intelligence surveillance.\nThe Supreme Court decision in \"United States v. U.S. District Court\" (1972) left open the possibility for a foreign intelligence surveillance exception to the warrant clause. Three United States Courts of Appeals have recognized a foreign intelligence surveillance exception to the warrant clause, but tied it to certain requirements. The exception to the Fourth Amendment was formally recognized by the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review in its 2008 \"In re Directives\" decision. The lower court held that \"a foreign intelligence exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement exists when surveillance is conducted to obtain foreign intelligence for national security purposes and is directed against foreign powers or agents of foreign powers reasonably believed to be located outside the United States\".\nDespite the foregoing citation the Fourth Amendment prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures nonetheless apply to the contents of all communications, whatever the means, because, \"a person's private communications are akin to personal papers\". Fourth Amendment reasonableness is the point at which the United States government's interest advanced by a particular search or seizure outweighs the loss of individual privacy or freedom of movement that attends the government's action. The United Supreme Court said in \"Board of Education v. Earls\" (2002) when 'special needs', beyond the normal need for law enforcement, make the warrant and probable-cause requirement impracticable the reasonableness of a search is determined by balancing the nature of the intrusion on the individual's privacy against the promotion of legitimate governmental interests. Additionally in \"Illinois v. Lidster\" (2004) the Court explained in judging reasonableness it looks to \"the gravity of the public concerns served by the seizure, the degree to which the seizure advances the public interest, and the severity of the interference with individual liberty\". To protect the telecommunications carriers cooperating with the U.S. government from legal action, the Congress passed a bill updating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to permit this type of surveillance.\nSchools and prisons.\nIn \"New Jersey v. T. L. O.\" (1985), the Supreme Court ruled that searches in public schools do not require warrants, as long as the searching officers have reasonable grounds for believing the search will result in finding evidence of illegal activity. Similarly, in \"Samson v. California\" (2006), the Court ruled that government offices may be searched for evidence of work-related misconduct by government employees on similar grounds. Searches of prison cells are subject to no restraints relating to reasonableness or probable cause. However, in \"Safford Unified School District v. Redding\" (2009), the Court ruled that school officials violated the Fourth Amendment when they strip searched a student based only on another student's claiming to have received drugs from her.\nExclusionary rule.\nOne way courts enforce the Fourth Amendment is through the use of the exclusionary rule. The rule provides that evidence obtained through a violation of the Fourth Amendment is generally not admissible by the prosecution during the defendant's criminal trial. The Court stated in \"Elkins v. United States\" (1960) that the rule's function \"is to deter\u2014to compel respect for the constitutional guaranty in the only effectively available way\u2014by removing the incentive to disregard it\".\nThe Court adopted the exclusionary rule in \"Weeks v. United States\" (1914), prior to which all evidence, no matter how seized, could be admitted in court. In \"Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States\" (1920) and \"Nardone v. United States\" (1939), the Court ruled that leads or other evidence resulting from illegally obtained evidence are also inadmissible in trials. Justice Felix Frankfurter described this secondary evidence in the \"Nardone\" decision as the \"fruit of the poisonous tree\". The Supreme Court rejected incorporating the exclusionary rule by way of the Fourteenth Amendment in \"Wolf v. Colorado\" (1949), but \"Wolf\" was explicitly overruled in \"Mapp v. Ohio\" (1961), making the Fourth Amendment (including the exclusionary rule) applicable in state proceedings.\nThe exclusionary rule and its effectiveness have often been controversial, particularly since its 1961 application to state proceedings. Critics charge that the rule hampers police investigation and can result in freeing guilty parties convicted on reliable evidence; other critics say the rule has not been successful in deterring illegal police searches. Proponents argue that the number of criminal convictions overturned under the rule has been minimal and that no other effective mechanism exists to enforce the Fourth Amendment. In 1982, California passed a \"Victim's Bill of Rights\" containing a provision to repeal the exclusionary rule; though the bill could not affect federally mandated rights under the Fourth Amendment, it blocked the state courts from expanding these protections further.\nLimitations.\nSince 1974, the Supreme Court has repeatedly limited the exclusionary rule. In \"United States v. Calandra\" (1974), the Court ruled that grand juries may use illegally obtained evidence when questioning witnesses, because \"the damage to that institution from the unprecedented extension of the exclusionary rule outweighs the benefit of any possible incremental deterrent effect\". Explaining the purpose of the rule, the Court said the rule \"is a judicially created remedy designed to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect, rather than a personal constitutional right of the party aggrieved\".\nThree cases in 1984 further restricted the exclusionary rule:\nIn \"Arizona v. Evans\" (1995) and \"Herring v. United States\" (2009), the Court ruled that the exclusionary rule does not apply to evidence found due to negligence regarding a government database, as long as the arresting police officer relied on that database in \"good faith\" and the negligence was not pervasive. In \"Davis v. United States\" (2011), the Court ruled that the exclusionary rule does not apply to a Fourth Amendment violation resulting from a reasonable reliance on binding appellate precedent. In \"Utah v. Strieff\" (2016), the Court ruled that evidence obtained from an unlawful police stop would not be excluded from court when the link between the stop and the evidence's discovery was \"attenuated\" by the discovery of an outstanding warrant during the stop.\nThe Supreme Court has also held the exclusionary rule to not apply in the following circumstances:\nMetadata.\nOn December 16, 2013, in \"Klayman v. Obama\", a United States district court ruled that the mass collection of metadata of Americans' telephone records by the National Security Agency probably violates the Fourth Amendment. The court granted a preliminary injunction, blocking the collection of phone data for two private plaintiffs and ordered the government to destroy any of their records that have been gathered. The court stayed the ruling pending a government appeal, recognizing the \"significant national security interests at stake in this case and the novelty of the constitutional issues\".\nHowever, in \"ACLU v. Clapper\", a United States district court ruled that the U.S. government's global telephone data-gathering system is needed to thwart potential terrorist attacks, and that it can work only if everyone's calls are included. The court also ruled that Congress legally set up the program and it does not violate anyone's constitutional rights. The court concluded that the telephone data being swept up by NSA did not belong to telephone users, but to the telephone companies. Also, the court held that when NSA obtains such data from the telephone companies, and then probes into it to find links between callers and potential terrorists, this further use of the data was not even a search under the Fourth Amendment, concluding that the controlling precedent is \"Smith v. Maryland\", saying: \"Smith's bedrock holding is that an individual has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information provided to third parties.\" The American Civil Liberties Union declared on January 2, 2014, that it will appeal the ruling that NSA bulk phone record collection is legal. \"The government has a legitimate interest in tracking the associations of suspected terrorists, but tracking those associations does not require the government to subject every citizen to permanent surveillance\", deputy ACLU legal director Jameel Jaffer said in a statement.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31658", "revid": "33438184", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31658", "title": "Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution", "text": "1791 amendment enumerating rights related to criminal prosecutions\nThe Sixth Amendment (Amendment VI) to the United States Constitution sets forth rights related to criminal prosecutions. It was ratified in 1791 as part of the United States Bill of Rights. The Supreme Court has applied all but one of this amendment's protections to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nThe Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants eight different rights, including the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury consisting of jurors from the state and district in which the crime was alleged to have been committed. Under the impartial jury requirement, jurors must be unbiased, and the jury must consist of a representative cross-section of the community. The right to a jury applies only to offenses in which the penalty is imprisonment for longer than six months. In \"Barker v. Wingo\", the Supreme Court articulated a balancing test to determine whether a defendant's right to a speedy trial had been violated. It has additionally held that the requirement of a public trial is not absolute and that both the government and the defendant can in some cases request a closed trial.\nThe Sixth Amendment requires that criminal defendants be given notice of the nature and cause of accusations against them. The amendment's Confrontation Clause gives criminal defendants the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses, while the Compulsory Process Clause gives criminal defendants the right to call their own witnesses and, in some cases, compel witnesses to testify. The Assistance of Counsel Clause grants criminal defendants the right to be assisted by counsel. In \"Gideon v. Wainwright\" (1963) and subsequent cases, the Supreme Court held that a public defender must be provided to criminal defendants unable to afford an attorney in all state court trials where the defendant faces the possibility of imprisonment. The Supreme Court has incorporated (protected at the state level) all Sixth Amendment protections except one: having a jury trial in the same state and district that the crime was committed.\nText.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\nRights secured.\nSpeedy trial.\nCriminal defendants have the right to a speedy trial. In \"Barker v. Wingo\", 407 U.S. https:// (1972), the Supreme Court laid down a four-part case-by-case balancing test for determining whether the defendant's speedy trial right has been violated. The four factors are:\nIn \"Strunk v. United States\", 412 U.S. https:// (1973), the Supreme Court ruled that if the reviewing court finds that a defendant's right to a speedy trial was violated, then the indictment must be dismissed and any conviction overturned. The Court held that, since the delayed trial is the state action which violates the defendant's rights, no other remedy would be appropriate. Thus, a reversal or dismissal of a criminal case on speedy trial grounds means no further prosecution for the alleged offense can take place.\nPublic trial.\nIn \"Sheppard v. Maxwell\", 384 U.S. https:// (1966), the Supreme Court ruled that the right to a public trial is not absolute. In cases where excess publicity would serve to undermine the defendant's right to due process, limitations can be put on public access to the proceedings. According to \"Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court\", 478 U.S. https:// (1986), trials can be closed at the behest of the government if there is \"an overriding interest based on findings that closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest\". The accused may also request a closure of the trial; though, it must be demonstrated that \"first, there is a substantial probability that the defendant's right to a fair trial will be prejudiced by publicity that closure would prevent, and second, reasonable alternatives to closure cannot adequately protect the defendant's right to a fair trial.\"\nImpartial jury.\nThe right to a jury has always depended on the nature of the offense with which the defendant is charged. Petty offenses\u2014those punishable by imprisonment for no more than six months\u2014are not covered by the jury requirement. Even where multiple petty offenses are concerned, the total time of imprisonment possibly exceeding six months, the right to a jury trial does not exist. Also, in the United States, except for serious offenses (such as murder), minors are usually tried in a juvenile court, which lessens the sentence allowed, but forfeits the right to a jury.\nOriginally, the Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial indicated a right to \"a trial by jury as understood and applied at common law, and includes all the essential elements as they were recognized in this country and England when the Constitution was adopted.\" Therefore, it was held that federal criminal juries had to be composed of twelve persons and that verdicts had to be unanimous, as was customary in England.\nWhen, under the Fourteenth Amendment, the Supreme Court extended the right to a trial by jury to defendants in state courts, it re-examined some of the standards. It has been held that twelve came to be the number of jurors by \"historical accident\", and that a jury of six would be sufficient, but anything less would deprive the defendant of a right to trial by jury. In \"Ramos v. Louisiana\" (2020), the Court ruled that the Sixth Amendment mandates unanimity in all federal and state criminal jury trials.\nImpartiality.\nThe Sixth Amendment requires juries to be impartial. Impartiality has been interpreted as requiring individual jurors to be unbiased. At \"voir dire\", each side may question potential jurors to determine any bias, and challenge them if the same is found; the court determines the validity of these challenges for cause. Defendants may not challenge a conviction because a challenge for cause was denied incorrectly if they had the opportunity to use peremptory challenges.\nIn \"Pe\u00f1a-Rodriguez v. Colorado\" (2017), the Supreme Court ruled that the Sixth Amendment requires a court in a criminal trial to investigate whether a jury's guilty verdict was based on racial bias. For a guilty verdict to be set aside based on the racial bias of a juror, the defendant must prove that the racial bias \"was a significant motivating factor in the juror's vote to convict\".\nVenire of juries.\nAnother factor in determining the impartiality of the jury is the nature of the panel, or venire, from which the jurors are selected. Venires must represent a fair cross-section of the community; the defendant might establish that the requirement was violated by showing that the allegedly excluded group is a \"distinctive\" one in the community, that the representation of such a group in venires is unreasonable and unfair in regard to the number of persons belonging to such a group, and that the under-representation is caused by a systematic exclusion in the selection process. Thus, in \"Taylor v. Louisiana\", 419 U.S. https:// (1975), the Supreme Court invalidated a state law that exempted women who had not made a declaration of willingness to serve from jury service, while not doing the same for men.\nSentencing.\nIn \"Apprendi v. New Jersey\", 530 U.S. https:// (2000), and \"Blakely v. Washington\", 542 U.S. https:// (2004), the Supreme Court ruled that a criminal defendant has a right to a jury trial not only on the question of guilt or innocence, but also regarding any fact used to increase the defendant's sentence beyond the maximum otherwise allowed by statutes or sentencing guidelines. In \"Alleyne v. United States\", 570 U.S. https:// (2013), the Court expanded on \"Apprendi\" and \"Blakely\" by ruling that a defendant's right to a jury applies to any fact that would increase a defendant's sentence beyond the minimum otherwise required by statute. In \"United States v. Haymond\", 588 U.S. ___ (2019), the Court decided a jury is required if a federal supervised release revocation would carry a mandatory minimum prison sentence.\nVicinage.\n of the Constitution requires defendants be tried by juries and in the state in which the crime was committed. The Sixth Amendment requires the jury to be selected from judicial districts ascertained by statute. In \"Beavers v. Henkel\", 194 U.S. https:// (1904), the Supreme Court ruled that the place where the offense is charged to have occurred determines a trial's location. Where multiple districts are alleged to have been locations of the crime, any of them may be chosen for the trial. In cases of offenses not committed in any state (for example, offenses committed at sea), the place of trial may be determined by the Congress. Unlike other Sixth Amendment guarantees, the Court has not incorporated the vicinage right.\nNotice of accusation.\nA criminal defendant has the right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against them. Therefore, an indictment must allege all the ingredients of the crime to such a degree of precision that it would allow the accused to assert double jeopardy if the same charges are brought up in subsequent prosecution. The Supreme Court held in \"United States v. Carll\", 105 U.S. https:// (1881), that \"in an indictment... it is not sufficient to set forth the offense in the words of the statute, unless those words of themselves fully, directly, and expressly, without any uncertainty or ambiguity, set forth all the elements necessary to constitute the offense intended to be punished.\" Vague wording, even if taken directly from a statute, does not suffice. However, the government is not required to hand over written copies of the indictment free of charge.\nConfrontation.\nThe Confrontation Clause relates to the common law rule preventing the admission of hearsay, that is to say, testimony by one witness as to the statements and observations of another person to prove that the statement or observation was true. The rationale was that the defendant had no opportunity to challenge the credibility of and cross-examine the person making the statements. Certain exceptions to the hearsay rule have been permitted; for instance, admissions by the defendant are admissible, as are dying declarations. Nevertheless, in \"California v. Green\", 399 U.S. https:// (1970), the Supreme Court has held that the hearsay rule is not the same as the Confrontation Clause. Hearsay is admissible under certain circumstances. For example, in \"Bruton v. United States\", 391 U.S. https:// (1968), the Supreme Court ruled that while a defendant's out of court statements were admissible in proving the defendant's guilt, they were inadmissible hearsay against another defendant. Hearsay may, in some circumstances, be admitted though it is not covered by one of the long-recognized exceptions. For example, prior testimony may sometimes be admitted if the witness is unavailable. However, in \"Crawford v. Washington\", 541 U.S. https:// (2004), the Supreme Court increased the scope of the Confrontation Clause by ruling that \"testimonial\" out-of-court statements are inadmissible if the accused did not have the opportunity to cross-examine that accuser and that accuser is unavailable at trial. In \"Davis v. Washington\" 547 U.S. https:// (2006), the Court ruled that \"testimonial\" refers to any statement that an objectively reasonable person in the declarant's situation would believe likely to be used in court. In \"Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts\", 557 U.S. https:// (2009), and \"Bullcoming v. New Mexico\", 564 U.S. https:// (2011), the Court ruled that admitting a lab chemist's analysis into evidence, without having him testify, violated the Confrontation Clause. In \"Michigan v. Bryant\", 562 U.S. https:// (2011), the Court ruled that the \"primary purpose\" of a shooting victim's statement as to who shot him, and the police's reason for questioning him, each had to be objectively determined. If the \"primary purpose\" was for dealing with an \"ongoing emergency\", then any such statement was not testimonial and so the Confrontation Clause would not require the person making that statement to testify in order for that statement to be admitted into evidence. The right to confront and cross-examine witnesses also applies to physical evidence; the prosecution must present physical evidence to the jury, providing the defense ample opportunity to cross-examine its validity and meaning. Prosecution generally may not refer to evidence without first presenting it. In \"Hemphill v. New York\", No. https://, 595 U.S. ___ (2022), the Court ruled the accused had to be given an opportunity to cross-examine a witness called to rebut the accused's defense, even if the trial judge rules that defense to be misleading.\nIn the late 20th and early 21st century this clause became an issue in the use of the silent witness rule.\nCompulsory process.\nThe Compulsory Process Clause gives any criminal defendant the right to call witnesses in his favor. If any such witness refuses to testify, that witness may be compelled to do so by the court at the request of the defendant. However, in some cases the court may refuse to permit a defense witness to testify. For example, if a defense lawyer fails to notify the prosecution of the identity of a witness to gain a tactical advantage, that witness may be precluded from testifying.\nAssistance of counsel.\nA criminal defendant has the right to be assisted by counsel.\nIn \"Powell v. Alabama\", 287 U.S. https:// (1932), the Supreme Court ruled that \"in a capital case, where the defendant is unable to employ counsel, and is incapable adequately of making his own defense because of ignorance, feeble mindedness, illiteracy, or the like, it is the duty of the court, whether requested or not, to assign counsel for him.\" In \"Johnson v. Zerbst\", 304 U.S. https:// (1938), the Supreme Court ruled that in all federal cases, counsel would have to be appointed for defendants who were too poor to hire their own.\nIn 1961, the Court extended the rule that applied in federal courts to state courts. It held in \"Hamilton v. Alabama\", 368 U.S. https:// (1961), that counsel had to be provided at no expense to defendants in capital cases when they so requested, even if there was no \"ignorance, feeble mindedness, illiteracy, or the like\". \"Gideon v. Wainwright\", 372 U.S. https:// (1963), ruled that counsel must be provided to indigent defendants in all felony cases, overruling \"Betts v. Brady\", 316 U.S. https:// (1942), in which the Court ruled that state courts had to appoint counsel only when the defendant demonstrated \"special circumstances\" requiring the assistance of counsel. Under \"Argersinger v. Hamlin\", 407 U.S. https:// (1972), counsel must be appointed in any case resulting in a sentence of actual imprisonment. Regarding sentences not immediately leading to imprisonment, the Court in \"Scott v. Illinois\", 440 U.S. https:// (1979), ruled that counsel did not need to be appointed, but in \"Alabama v. Shelton\", 535 U.S. https:// (2002), the Court held that a suspended sentence that may result in incarceration cannot be imposed if the defendant did not have counsel at trial.\nAs stated in \"Brewer v. Williams\", 430 U.S. https:// (1977), the right to counsel \"[means] at least that a person is entitled to the help of a lawyer at or after the time that judicial proceedings have been initiated against him, whether by formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.\" \"Brewer\" goes on to conclude that once adversary proceedings have begun against a defendant, he has a right to legal assistance when the government interrogates him and that when a defendant is arrested, \"arraigned on [an arrest] warrant before a judge\", and \"committed by the court to confinement\", \"[t]here can be no doubt that judicial proceedings ha[ve] been initiated.\"\nSelf-representation.\nA criminal defendant may represent himself, unless a court deems the defendant to be incompetent to waive the right to counsel.\nIn \"Faretta v. California\", 422 U.S. https:// (1975), the Supreme Court recognized a defendant's right to \"pro se\" representation. However, under \"Godinez v. Moran\", 509 U.S. https:// (1993), a court that believes the defendant is less than fully competent to represent himself can require that defendant to be assisted by counsel. In \"Martinez v. Court of Appeal of California\", 528 U.S. https:// (2000), the Supreme Court ruled the right to \"pro se\" representation did not apply to appellate courts. In \"Indiana v. Edwards\", 554 U.S. 164 (2008), the Court ruled that a criminal defendant could be simultaneously competent to stand trial, but not competent to represent himself.\nIn \"Bounds v. Smith\", 430 U.S. https:// (1977), the Supreme Court held that the constitutional right of \"meaningful access to the courts\" can be satisfied by counsel or access to legal materials. \"Bounds\" has been interpreted by several United States courts of appeals to mean a \"pro se\" defendant does not have a constitutional right to access a prison law library to research his defense when access to the courts has been provided through appointed counsel.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This amendment codifies the right to a jury trial in certain civil cases and inhibits courts from overturning a jury's findings of fact.\nAn early version of the Seventh Amendment was introduced in Congress in 1789 by James Madison, along with the other amendments, in response to Anti-Federalist objections to the new Constitution. Congress proposed a revised version of the Seventh Amendment to the states on September 28, 1789, and by December 15, 1791, the necessary three-quarters of the states had ratified it.\nThe Seventh Amendment is generally considered one of the more straightforward amendments of the Bill of Rights. While the Seventh Amendment's provision for jury trials in civil cases has never been incorporated (applied to the states), almost every state has a provision for jury trials in civil cases in its constitution. The prohibition of overturning a jury's findings of fact applies to federal cases, state cases involving federal law, and to review of state cases by federal courts. \"United States v. Wonson\" (1812) established the \"historical test\", which interpreted the amendment as relying on English common law to determine whether a jury trial was necessary in a civil suit. The amendment thus does not guarantee trial by jury in cases under maritime law, in lawsuits against the government itself, and for many parts of patent claims. In all other cases, the jury can be waived by consent of the parties.\nThe amendment additionally guarantees a minimum of six members for a jury in a civil trial. The amendment's twenty-dollar threshold has not been the subject of much scholarly or judicial writing and still remains applicable despite the inflation that has occurred since the late 18th century ($20 in 1791 is ; $20 in 1800 was convertible to a Troy ounce of gold).\nText.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.\nBackground.\nAfter several years of comparatively weak government under the Articles of Confederation, a Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia proposed a new constitution on September 17, 1787, featuring a stronger chief executive and other changes. George Mason, a Constitutional Convention delegate and the drafter of Virginia's Declaration of Rights, proposed that a bill of rights listing and guaranteeing civil liberties be included. Other delegates\u2014including future Bill of Rights drafter James Madison\u2014disagreed, arguing that existing state guarantees of civil liberties were sufficient and any attempt to enumerate individual rights risked implying the federal government had power to violate every other right (this concern eventually led to the Ninth and Tenth Amendments). After a brief debate, Mason's proposal was defeated by a unanimous vote of the state delegations. In the final days of the convention, North Carolina delegate Hugh Williamson proposed a guarantee of trial by jury in federal civil cases, but a motion to add this guarantee was also defeated.\nHowever, adoption of the Constitution required that nine of the thirteen states ratify it in state conventions. Opposition to ratification (\"Anti-Federalism\") was partly based on the Constitution's lack of adequate guarantees for civil liberties. Supporters of the Constitution in states where popular sentiment was against ratification (including Virginia, Massachusetts, and New York) successfully proposed that their state conventions both ratify the Constitution and call for the addition of a bill of rights.\nOne charge of the Anti-Federalists was that giving the U.S. Supreme Court jurisdiction \"both as to law and fact\" would allow it to deny the findings of jury trials in civil cases. Responding to these concerns, five state ratification conventions recommended a constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to jury trial in civil cases.\nProposal and ratification.\nIn the 1st United States Congress, following the state legislatures' request, James Madison proposed twenty constitutional amendments based on state bills of rights and English sources such as the Bill of Rights 1689. Among them was an amendment protecting findings of fact in civil cases exceeding a certain dollar value from judicial review. Madison proposed that this amendment should be added directly to Article III, though Congress later determined to add the proposed Bill of Rights to the end of the Constitution, leaving the original text intact. Congress also reduced Madison's proposed twenty amendments to twelve, and these were proposed to the states for ratification on September 25, 1789.\nBy the time the Bill of Rights was submitted to the states for ratification, opinions had shifted in both parties. Many Federalists, who had previously opposed a Bill of Rights, now supported the Bill as a means of silencing the Anti-Federalists' most effective criticism. Many Anti-Federalists, in contrast, now opposed it, realizing the Bill's adoption would greatly lessen the chances of a second constitutional convention, which they desired. Anti-Federalists such as Richard Henry Lee also argued that the Bill left the most objectionable portions of the Constitution, such as the federal judiciary and direct taxation, intact.\nOn November 20, 1789, New Jersey ratified eleven of the twelve amendments, rejecting an amendment to regulate congressional pay raises. On December 19 and 22, respectively, Maryland and North Carolina ratified all twelve amendments. On January 19, 25, and 28, 1790, respectively, South Carolina, New Hampshire, and Delaware ratified the Bill, though New Hampshire rejected the amendment on Congressional pay raises, and Delaware rejected the Congressional Apportionment Amendment. This brought the total of ratifying states to six of the required ten, but the process stalled in other states: Connecticut and Georgia found a Bill of Rights unnecessary and so refused to ratify, while Massachusetts ratified most of the amendments, but failed to send official notice to the Secretary of State that it had done so.\nIn February through June 1790, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island ratified eleven of the amendments, though all three rejected the amendment on Congressional pay raises. Virginia initially postponed its debate, but after Vermont was admitted to the Union in 1791, the total number of states needed for ratification rose to eleven. Vermont ratified on November 3, 1791, approving all twelve amendments, and Virginia finally followed on December 15, 1791. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson announced the adoption of the ten successfully ratified amendments on March 1, 1792.\nJudicial interpretation.\nThe Seventh Amendment encompasses two clauses. The Preservation Clause (\"In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved\") sets out the types of cases juries are required to decide, while the Re-examination Clause (\"[N]o fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law\") prevents federal judges from overturning jury verdicts in certain ways. The Legal Information Institute stated with respect to the Preservation Clause: \"Sir William Blackstone, in his influential treatise on English common law, called the right 'the glory of the English law' and necessary for '[t]he impartial administration of justice', which, if 'entirely entrusted to the magistracy, a select body of men', would be subject 'frequently [to] an involuntary bias towards those of their own rank and dignity'.\" The amendment is generally considered one of the more straightforward amendments of the Bill of Rights. Scholar Charles W. Wolfram states that it has usually \"been interpreted as if it were virtually a self-explanatory provision\". According to the National Constitution Center, both times the term \"common law\" is used in the Seventh Amendment refers to \"the law and procedure of the courts that used juries, as opposed to Equity and other courts that did not use juries\".\nUnlike most of the provisions of the Bill of Rights, the Seventh Amendment has never been applied to the states. The Supreme Court stated in \"Walker v. Sauvinet\" (1875), \"Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis Railroad v. Bombolis\" (1916) and \"Hardware Dealers' Mut. Fire Ins. Co. of Wisconsin v. Glidden Co.\" (1931) that states were not required to provide jury trials in civil cases. Nonetheless, most states voluntarily guarantee the right to a civil jury trial, and they must do so in certain state court cases that are decided under federal law.\nHistorical test.\nThe first judicial opinion issued on the amendment came in \"United States v. Wonson\" (1812), in which the federal government wished to retry the facts of a civil case it had lost against Samuel Wonson. Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story, acting as a circuit court judge, ruled for Wonson, stating that to retry the facts of the case would violate the Seventh Amendment. Regarding the amendment's phrase \"the rules of common law\", Story wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Wonson\"'s ruling established the \"historical test\", which interpreted the amendment as relying on English common law to determine whether a jury trial was necessary in a civil suit. Applying the historical test in \"Parsons v. Bedford\" (1830), for example, the Supreme Court found that jury trials were not constitutionally guaranteed for cases under maritime law, an area in which English common law did not require juries. The Court further clarified this rule as a \"fixed historical test\" in \"Thompson v. Utah\" (1898), which established that the relevant guide was English common law of 1791, rather than that of the present day. In \"Dimick v. Schiedt\" (1935), the Supreme Court declared that the Seventh Amendment was to be interpreted according to the common law of England at the time of the amendment's adoption in 1791. The Supreme Court in \"Baltimore &amp; Carolina Line, Inc. v. Redman\" (1935) declared that the right of trial by jury thus preserved by the Preservation Clause is the right which existed under the English common law when the amendment was adopted. \"The amendment not only preserves that right, but discloses a studied purpose to protect it from indirect impairment through possible enlargements of the power of reexamination existing under the common law, and, to that end, declares that 'no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise reexamined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law'.\" In \"Baltimore &amp; Carolina Line, Inc. v. Redman\" (1935), the Supreme Court held that the amendment does not include \"mere matters of form or procedure\", but instead preserves the \"substance\" of the right to jury trial. The aim of the amendment is particularly to retain the common law distinction between the province of the court and that of the jury whereby, in the absence of express or implied consent to the contrary, issues of law are to be resolved by the court and issues of fact are to be determined by the jury under appropriate instructions by the court. In \"Chauffeurs, Teamsters, and Helpers Local No. 391 v. Terry\" (1990), the Court explained that the right to a jury trial provided by the Seventh Amendment encompasses more than the common law forms of action recognized in 1791 (when the Bill of Rights was ratified), but rather any lawsuit in which parties' legal rights were to be determined, as opposed to suits that involve only equitable rights and remedies. This echoes a statement for the Supreme Court in \"Curtis v. Leother\", 415 U.S. 189 (1974) where it stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn \"SEC v. Jarkesy\" (2024) the Supreme Court stated the following:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;By its text, the Seventh Amendment guarantees that in \u201c[s]uits at common law, . . . the right of trial by jury shall be preserved.\u201d In construing this language, we have noted that the right is not limited to the \u201ccommon-law forms of action recognized\u201d when the Seventh Amendment was ratified. \"Curtis v. Loether\", 415 U. S. 189, 193 (1974). As Justice Story explained, the Framers used the term \u201ccommon law\u201d in the Amendment \u201cin contradistinction to equity, and admiralty, and maritime jurisprudence.\u201d \"Parsons\", 3 Pet., at 446. The Amendment therefore \u201cembrace[s] all suits which are not of equity or admiralty jurisdiction, whatever may be the peculiar form which they may assume.\u201d \"Id.\", at 447. \nThe Seventh Amendment extends to a particular statutory claim if the claim is \u201clegal in nature.\u201d \"Granfinanciera\", 492 U. S., at 53. As we made clear in \"Tull\", whether that claim is statutory is immaterial to this analysis. See 481 U. S., at 414\u2013415, 417\u2013425. In that case, the Government sued a real estate developer for civil penalties in federal court. The developer responded by invoking his right to a jury trial. Although the cause of action arose under the Clean Water Act, the Court surveyed early cases to show that the statutory nature of the claim was not legally relevant. \u201cActions by the Government to recover civil penalties under statutory provisions,\u201d we explained, \u201chistorically ha[d] been viewed as [a] type of action in debt requiring trial by jury.\u201d \"Id.\", at 418\u2013419. To determine whether a suit is legal in nature, we directed courts to consider the cause of action and the remedy it provides. Since some causes of action sound in both law and equity, we concluded that the remedy was the \u201cmore important\u201d consideration. \"Id.\", at 421 (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted); see id., at 418\u2013421. (emphasis in original)\nIn \"Galloway v. United States\" (1943), the Court permitted a directed verdict (a verdict ordered by a judge on the basis of overwhelming lack of evidence) in a civil suit, finding that it did not violate the Seventh Amendment under the fixed historical test. The Court extended the amendment's guarantees in \"Beacon Theatres v. Westover\" (1959) and \"Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood\" (1962), ruling in each case that all issues that required trial by jury under English common law also required trial by jury under the Seventh Amendment. This guarantee was also further extended to shareholder suits in \"Ross v. Bernhard\" (1970) and to copyright infringement lawsuits in \"Feltner v. Columbia Pictures TV\" (1998).\nIn \"Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc.\" (1996), the Court ruled that many parts of patent claims are questions of law rather than of fact, and that the Seventh Amendment guarantee of a jury trial therefore does not necessarily apply.\nLawsuits against the federal government itself do not receive Seventh Amendment protections due to the doctrine of sovereign immunity. In \"Lehman v. Nakshian\" (1981), the Court ruled that \"the plaintiff in an action against the United States has a right to trial by jury only where Congress has affirmatively and unambiguously granted that right by statute\".\nJury size.\nThe Supreme Court has held that the Seventh Amendment's guarantee of a jury trial also guarantees a jury of sufficient size. The Court found a six-member jury sufficient to meet the amendment's requirements in \"Colgrove v. Battin\" (1973).\nTwenty-dollar requirement.\nLittle historical evidence exists to interpret the amendment's reference to \"twenty dollars\", which was added in a closed session of the Senate and is often omitted in judicial and scholarly discussion of the amendment. A \"Harvard Law Review\" article described it as \"mysterious... of shrouded origin and neglected for two centuries\", stating that \"no one believes that the Clause bears on the right protected by the Seventh Amendment\". According to law professor Philip Hamburger, the twenty-dollar requirement was intended to become obsolete by inflation, so that its application to more cases would be phased out gradually. $20 in 1791 is .\nCongress has never extended federal diversity jurisdiction to amounts that small. Under federal law (28 U.S.C. \u00a71332), the amount in dispute must exceed $75,000 for a case to be heard in federal court based on diversity of the parties' citizenship (the parties are from different states or different countries). However, civil cases may arise in federal court that are not diversity cases (e.g., in places like the District of Columbia that are federal jurisdictions), in which case the Twenty Dollars Clause may apply.\nRe-examination of facts.\nThe Re-Examination Clause of the Seventh Amendment states: \"In suits at common law... no fact tried by jury, shall be otherwise reexamined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.\" This clause forbids any court from re-examining or overturning any factual determinations made by a jury guaranteeing that facts decided by that jury cannot be reexamined at a later date. Exceptions to this prohibition are possible if it is later determined that legal errors were made or evidence submitted was insufficient in some way. In such cases the re-examination is conducted by another jury so the decision is still left in the hands of the people. The clause applies only to cases where private rights\u2014i.e., rights that exist between private citizens\u2014have been violated. The Re-Examination Clause applies not only to federal courts, but also to \"a case tried before a jury in a state court and brought to the Supreme Court on appeal\".\nIn \"The Justices v. Murray\", 76 U.S. 9 Wall. 274 (1869), the Supreme Court quoted Justice Joseph Story to explain the modes to reexamine facts tried by juries according to common law: \"Mr. Justice Story\u00a0... referring to this part of the amendment, observed\u00a0... that it was 'a prohibition to the courts of the United States to re-examine any facts tried by a jury in any other manner [than according to Common Law]'.\u00a0... He further observed that 'the only modes known to the common law to re-examine such facts was the granting of a new trial by the court where the issue was tried, or the award of a , by the appellate court, for some error of law that had intervened in the proceedings.'\"\nAs common law provided, the judge could set aside (or nullify) a jury verdict when the judge decided the verdict was contrary to the evidence or the law. Common law precluded the judge from himself entering a verdict; a new trial, with a new jury, was the only course permissible. In \"Slocum v. New York Insurance Co.\" (1913), the Supreme Court upheld this rule. Later cases have undermined \"Slocum\", but generally only when the evidence is overwhelming, or if a specific law provides narrow guidelines by which there can be no reasonable question as to the required outcome, may the court enter \"judgment as a matter of law\" or otherwise set aside the jury's findings.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This amendment was adopted on December 15, 1791, along with the rest of the United States Bill of Rights. The amendment serves as a limitation upon the state or federal government to impose unduly harsh penalties on criminal defendants before and after a conviction. This limitation applies equally to the price for obtaining pretrial release and the punishment for crime after conviction. The phrases in this amendment originated in the English Bill of Rights of 1689.\nThe prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments has led courts to hold that the Constitution totally prohibits certain kinds of punishment, such as drawing and quartering. Under the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause, the Supreme Court has struck down the application of capital punishment in some instances, but capital punishment is still permitted in some cases where the defendant is convicted of murder.\nThe Supreme Court has held that the Excessive Fines Clause prohibits fines that are \"grossly disproportional to the gravity of [the] offense.\" The Court struck down a fine as excessive for the first time in \"United States v. Bajakajian\" (1998). Under the Excessive Bail Clause, the Supreme Court has held that the federal government cannot set bail at \"a figure higher than is reasonably calculated\" to ensure the defendant's appearance at trial. The Supreme Court has ruled that the Excessive Fines Clause and the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause apply to the states, but has not done this regarding the Excessive Bail Clause.\nText.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\nBackground and general aspects.\nBackground.\nThe Eighth Amendment was adopted, as part of the Bill of Rights, in 1791. It is almost identical to a provision in the English Bill of Rights of 1689, in which Parliament declared, \"as their ancestors in like cases have usually done... that excessive bail ought not to be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\"\nThe provision was largely inspired by the case in England of Titus Oates who, after the accession of King James II in 1685, was tried for multiple acts of perjury that had led to executions of many people Oates had wrongly accused. Oates was sentenced to imprisonment, including an annual ordeal of being taken out for two days' pillory plus one day of whipping while tied to a moving cart. The Oates case eventually became a topic of the U.S. Supreme Court's Eighth Amendment jurisprudence. The punishment of Oates involved ordinary penalties collectively imposed in a barbaric, excessive and bizarre manner. The reason why the judges in Oates' perjury case were not allowed to impose the death penalty (unlike in the cases of those whom Oates had falsely accused) may be because such a punishment would have deterred even honest witnesses from testifying in later cases.\nEngland's declaration against \"cruel and unusual punishments\" was approved by Parliament in February 1689, and was read to King William III and his wife Queen Mary II as the Declaration of Right on the following day. Members of Parliament then explained in August 1689 that \"the Commons had a particular regard... when that Declaration was first made\" to punishments like the one that had been inflicted by the King's Bench against Titus Oates. Parliament then enacted the English Bill of Rights into law in December 1689. Members of parliament characterized the punishment in the Oates case as not just \"barbarous\" and \"inhuman\" but also \"extravagant\" and \"exorbitant\".\nThere is some scholarly dispute about whom the clause intended to limit. In England, the \"cruel and unusual punishments\" clause may have been a limitation on the discretion of judges, requiring them to adhere to precedent. According to the great treatise of the 1760s by William Blackstone entitled \"Commentaries on the Laws of England\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[H]owever unlimited the power of the court may seem, it is far from being wholly arbitrary; but its discretion is regulated by law. For the bill of rights has particularly declared, that excessive fines ought not to be imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted: (which had a retrospect to some unprecedented proceedings in the court of king's bench, in the reign of king James the second)...\nVirginia adopted this provision of the English Bill of Rights in the Virginia Declaration of Rights of 1776, and the Virginia convention that ratified the U.S. Constitution recommended in 1788 that this language also be included in the Constitution. Virginians such as George Mason and Patrick Henry wanted to ensure this restriction would also be applied as a limitation on Congress. Mason warned that, otherwise, Congress may \"inflict unusual and severe punishments\". Henry emphasized that Congress should not be allowed to depart from precedent:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What has distinguished our ancestors?\u2014That they would not admit of tortures, or cruel and barbarous punishment. But Congress may introduce the practice of the civil law, in preference to that of the common law. They may introduce the practice of France, Spain, and Germany--of torturing, to extort a confession of the crime. They will say that they might as well draw examples from those countries as from Great Britain, and they will tell you that there is such a necessity of strengthening the arm of government, that they must have a criminal equity, and extort confession by torture, in order to punish with still more relentless severity. We are then lost and undone.\nUltimately, Henry and Mason prevailed, and the Eighth Amendment was adopted. James Madison changed \"ought\" to \"shall\", when he proposed the amendment to Congress in 1789.\nGeneral aspects.\nIn \"Coker v. Georgia\" (1977) it was decided that \"Eighth Amendment judgments should not be, or appear to be, merely the subjective views of individual Justices; judgment should be informed by objective factors to the maximum possible extent.\" In \"Timbs v. Indiana\" (2019) the Supreme Court stated that the Excessive Bail Clause, the Excessive Fines Clause and the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause together form a shield against abuses stemming from the government's punitive or criminal-law-enforcement authority.\nExcessive bail.\nIn England, sheriffs originally determined whether to grant bail to criminal suspects. Since they tended to abuse their power, Parliament passed a statute in 1275 whereby bailable and non-bailable offenses were defined. The King's judges often subverted the provisions of the law. It was held that an individual may be held without bail upon the Sovereign's command. Eventually, the Petition of Right of 1628 argued that the King did not have such authority. Later, technicalities in the law were exploited to keep the accused imprisoned without bail even where the offenses were bailable; such loopholes were for the most part closed by the Habeas Corpus Act 1679. Thereafter, judges were compelled to set bail, but they often required impracticable amounts. Finally, the English Bill of Rights (1689) held that \"excessive bail ought not to be required.\"\nHowever, the English Bill of Rights did not determine the distinction between bailable and non-bailable offenses. Thus, the Eighth Amendment has been interpreted to mean that bail may be denied if the charges are sufficiently serious.\nThe Supreme Court has also permitted \"preventive\" detention without bail. In \"United States v. Salerno\", 481 U.S. https:// (1987), the Supreme Court held that the only limitation imposed by the Excessive Bail Clause is that \"the government's proposed conditions of release or detention not be 'excessive' in light of the perceived evil\". In \"Stack v. Boyle\", 342 U.S. https:// (1951), the Supreme Court declared that a bail amount is \"excessive\" under the Eighth Amendment if it were \"a figure higher than is reasonably calculated\" to ensure the defendant's appearance at trial.\nThe incorporation status of the Excessive Bail Clause is unclear. In \"Schilb v. Kuebel\", 404 U.S. 357 (1971), the Court stated in \"dicta\": \"Bail, of course, is basic to our system of law, and the Eighth Amendment's proscription of excessive bail has been assumed to have application to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.\" In \"McDonald v. City of Chicago\" (2010), the right against excessive bail was included in a footnote listing incorporated rights.\nExcessive fines.\n\"Browning-Ferris v. Kelco\".\nIn \"Browning-Ferris Industries of Vermont, Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc.\", 492 U.S. https:// (1989), the Supreme Court ruled that the Excessive Fines Clause does not apply \"when the government neither has prosecuted the action nor has any right to receive a share of the damages awarded\". While punitive damages in civil cases are not covered by the Excessive Fines Clause, such damages were held to be covered by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, notably in \"State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Campbell\", 538 U.S. https:// (2003).\n\"Austin v. United States\".\nIn \"Austin v. United States\" 509 U.S. https:// (1993), the Supreme Court ruled that the Excessive Fines Clause does apply to civil asset forfeiture actions taken by the federal government, in the specific case, the government's seizure of the petitioner's mobile home and auto body shop on the basis of his drug dealing on the premises.\n\"United States v. Bajakajian\".\nIn \"United States v. Bajakajian\", 524 U.S. https:// (1998), the Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional to confiscate $357,144 from Hosep Bajakajian, who had failed to report possession of over $10,000 while leaving the United States. In what was the first case in which the Supreme Court ruled that a fine violated the Excessive Fines Clause, the Court held that it was \"grossly disproportional\" to take all the money Bajakajian had attempted to take out of the United States in violation of a federal law that required that he report an amount in excess of $10,000. In describing what constituted \"gross disproportionality\", the Court could not find any guidance from the history of the Excessive Fines Clause, and so looked to Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause case law:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We must therefore rely on other considerations in deriving a constitutional excessiveness standard, and there are two that we find particularly relevant. The first, which we have emphasized in our cases interpreting the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, is that judgments about the appropriate punishment for an offense belong in the first instance to the legislature. See, e.g., \"Solem v. Helm\", 463 U.S. 277, 290 (1983) (\"Reviewing courts... should grant substantial deference to the broad authority that legislatures necessarily possess in determining the types and limits of punishments for crimes\"); see also \"Gore v. United States\", 357 U.S. 386, 393 (1958) (\"Whatever views may be entertained regarding severity of punishment... these are peculiarly questions of legislative policy\"). The second is that any judicial determination regarding the gravity of a particular criminal offense will be inherently imprecise. Both of these principles counsel against requiring strict proportionality between the amount of a punitive forfeiture and the gravity of a criminal offense, and we therefore adopt the standard of gross disproportionality articulated in our Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause precedents. See, e.g., \"Solem v. Helm\", supra, at 288; \"Rummel v. Estelle\", 445 U.S. 263, 271 (1980).\nThus the Court declared that, within the context of judicial deference to the legislature's power to set punishments, a fine would not offend the Eighth Amendment unless it were \"grossly disproportional to the gravity of a defendant's offense\".\n\"Timbs v. Indiana\".\nIn \"Timbs v. Indiana\" the Supreme Court ruled that the Excessive Fines Clause applies to state and local governments under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The case involves the use of civil asset forfeiture to seize a $42,000 vehicle under state law in addition to the imposition of a $1,200 fine for drug trafficking charges, house arrest, and probation.\nCruel and unusual punishments.\nGeneral aspects.\nThe Constitution was amended to prohibit cruel and unusual punishments as part of the United States Bill of Rights as a result of objections raised by people such as Abraham Holmes and Patrick Henry. While Holmes feared the establishment of the Inquisition in the United States, Henry was concerned with the application of torture as a way of extracting confessions. They also feared that the federal government would misuse its powers to create federal crimes as well as to punish those who committed them under the new Constitution and thus use these powers as a way to oppress the people. Abraham Holmes, a member of the Massachusetts Ratifying Convention for the federal constitution, for example noted in a letter from January 30, 1788, that the new Constitution would give the U.S. Congress the power \"to ascertain, point out, and determine, what kind of punishments shall be inflicted on persons convicted of crimes.\" He added with respect those who would belong to the new government under the new Constitution: \"They are nowhere restrained from inventing the most cruel and unheard-of punishments, and annexing them to crimes; and there is no constitutional check on them, but that racks and gibbets may be amongst the most mild instruments of their discipline.\"\nRelying on the history of the Eighth Amendment and its own caselaw the Supreme Court stated in \"Ingraham v. Wright\" (1977) that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause was designed to protect those convicted of crimes. The Supreme Court consequently determined in \"Ingraham\" that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause limits the criminal process in three ways: \"[F]irst, it limits the kinds of punishment that can be imposed on those convicted of crimes, \"e.g., Estelle v. Gamble, supra; Trop v. Dulles, supra;\" second, it proscribes punishment grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime, \"e.g., Weems v. United States, supra\"; and third, it imposes substantive limits on what can be made criminal and punished as such, \"e.g., Robinson v. California, supra\".\" The Supreme court observed in \"Weems v. United States\" (1910) that the clause of the Constitution prohibiting the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment is \"progressive, and is not fastened to the obsolete, but may acquire meaning as public opinion becomes enlightened by a humane justice.\"\nIn \"Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber\", 329 U.S. https:// (1947), the Supreme Court assumed \"arguendo\" that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause applied to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In \"Robinson v. California\", 370 U.S. https:// (1962), the Court ruled that it did apply to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. \"Robinson\" was the first case in which the Supreme Court applied the Eighth Amendment against the state governments through the Fourteenth Amendment. Before \"Robinson\", the Eighth Amendment had been applied previously only in cases against the federal government.\nJustice Potter Stewart's opinion for the \"Robinson\" Court held that \"infliction of cruel and unusual punishment is in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\" The framers of the Fourteenth Amendment, such as John Bingham, had discussed this subject:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Many instances of State injustice and oppression have already occurred in the State legislation of this Union, of flagrant violations of the guarantied privileges of citizens of the United States, for which the national Government furnished and could furnish by law no remedy whatever. Contrary to the express letter of your Constitution, \"cruel and unusual punishments\" have been inflicted under State laws within this Union upon citizens, not only for crimes committed, but for sacred duty done, for which and against which the Government of the United States had provided no remedy and could provide none.\nIn \"Furman v. Georgia\", 408 U.S. https:// (1972), Justice Brennan wrote, \"There are, then, four principles by which we may determine whether a particular punishment is 'cruel and unusual'.\"\nJustice Brennan added: \"The function of these principles, after all, is simply to provide [the] means by which a court can determine whether [the] challenged punishment comports with human dignity. They are, therefore, interrelated, and, in most cases, it will be their convergence that will justify the conclusion that a punishment is 'cruel and unusual'. The test, then, will ordinarily be a cumulative one: if a punishment is unusually severe, if there is a strong probability that it is inflicted arbitrarily, if it is substantially rejected by contemporary society, and if there is no reason to believe that it serves any penal purpose more effectively than some less severe punishment, then the continued infliction of that punishment violates the command of the Clause that the State may not inflict inhuman and uncivilized punishments upon those convicted of crimes.\"\nJustice Brennan also wrote that he expected no state would pass a law obviously violating any one of these principles, so court decisions regarding the Eighth Amendment would involve a \"cumulative\" analysis of the implication of each of the four principles. In this way, the United States Supreme Court \"set the standard that a punishment would be cruel and unusual [if] it was too severe for the crime, [if] it was arbitrary, if it offended society's sense of justice, or if it was not more effective than a less severe penalty.\"\nThe plurality of the Supreme Court in \"Furman v. Georgia\" stated that the Eighth Amendment is not static, but that its meaning is interpreted in a flexible and dynamic manner to accord with, in the words of \"Trop v. Dulles\", 356 U.S. https:// (1958), at page 101, \"the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\" Punishments including capital punishment must therefore not be \"excessive\". The \"excessiveness\" of a punishment can be measured by two different aspects, which are independent of each other. The first aspect is whether the punishment involves the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain. The second aspect is that the punishment must not be grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime. In \"Miller v. Alabama\", 567 U.S. 460 (2012), the Court explained that the Eighth Amendment \"guarantees individuals the right not to be subjected to excessive sanctions\", and that \"punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned to both the offender and the offense.\" The Supreme Court has also looked to \"the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society\" when addressing the prohibition on cruel and unusual punishments.\nJustice Antonin Scalia noted in a concurring opinion in \"Callins v. Collins\" (1994): \"The Fifth Amendment provides that \"[n]o person shall be held to answer for a capital . . . crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, . . . nor be deprived of life . . . without due process of law.\" This clearly permits the death penalty to be imposed, and establishes beyond doubt that the death penalty is not one of the \"cruel and unusual punishments\" prohibited by the Eighth Amendment.\" A similar observation was made by the Supreme Court in 2019. The Supreme Court held in \"Bucklew v. Precythe\" (2019) that the Due Process Clause expressly allows the death penalty in the United States because \"the Fifth Amendment, added to the Constitution at the same time as the Eighth, expressly contemplates that a defendant may be tried for a 'capital' crime and 'deprived of life' as a penalty, so long as proper procedures are followed\". The Court also explicitly said: \"The Constitution allows capital punishment. [...] Nor did the later addition of the Eighth Amendment outlaw the practice. [...] The same Constitution that permits States to authorize capital punishment also allows them to outlaw it. [...] While the Eighth Amendment doesn't forbid capital punishment, it does speak to how States may carry out that punishment, prohibiting methods that are 'cruel and unusual'.\" The Court also explained in \"Bucklew\" that \u201cwhat unites the punishments the Eighth Amendment was understood to forbid, and distinguishes them from those it was understood to allow, is that the former were long disused (unusual) forms of punishment that intensified the sentence of death with a (cruel) superadd[ition] of terror, pain, or disgrace.\"\nSpecific aspects.\nAccording to the Supreme Court, the Eighth Amendment forbids some punishments entirely, and forbids some other punishments that are excessive when compared to the crime, or compared to the competence of the perpetrator. This will be discussed in the sections below.\nPunishments forbidden regardless of the crime.\nIn \"Wilkerson v. Utah\", 99 U.S. https:// (1878), the Supreme Court commented that drawing and quartering, public dissection, burning alive, or disembowelment constituted cruel and unusual punishment. Relying on Eighth Amendment case law Justice William O. Douglas stated in his \"Robinson v. California\", 370 U.S. https:// (1962) concurrence opinion that \"historic punishments that were cruel and unusual included \"burning at the stake, crucifixion, breaking on the wheel\" (\"In re Kemmler\", 136 U. S. 436, 136 U. S. 446), quartering, the rack and thumbscrew (see \"Chambers v. Florida\", 309 U. S. 227, 309 U. S. 237), and, in some circumstances, even solitary confinement (see In re Medley, 134 U. S. 160, 134 U. S. 167-168).\" In \"Thompson v. Oklahoma\", 487 U.S. https:// (1988), the Supreme Court ruled that the death penalty constituted cruel and unusual punishment if the defendant is under age 16 when the crime was committed. Furthermore, in \"Roper v. Simmons\", 543 U.S. https:// (2005), the Court barred the executing of people who were under age 18 when the crime was committed. In \"Atkins v. Virginia\", 536 U.S. https:// (2002), the Court declared that executing people who are mentally handicapped constituted cruel and unusual punishment.\nPunishments forbidden for certain crimes.\nThe case of \"Weems v. United States\", 217 U.S. https:// (1910), marked the first time the Supreme Court exercised judicial review to overturn a criminal sentence as cruel and unusual. The Court overturned a punishment called cadena temporal, which mandated \"hard and painful labor\", shackling for the duration of incarceration, and permanent civil disabilities. This case is often viewed as establishing a principle of proportionality under the Eighth Amendment. However, others have written that \"it is hard to view \"Weems\" as announcing a constitutional requirement of proportionality.\"\nIn \"Trop v. Dulles\", 356 U.S. https:// (1958), the Supreme Court held that punishing a natural-born citizen for a crime by revoking his citizenship is unconstitutional, being \"more primitive than torture\" because it involved the \"total destruction of the individual's status in organized society\".\nIn \"Robinson v. California\", 370 U.S. https:// (1962), the Court decided a California law authorizing a 90-day jail sentence for \"be[ing] addicted to the use of narcotics\" violated the Eighth Amendment, as narcotics addiction \"is apparently an illness\", and California was attempting to punish people based on the state of this illness, rather than for any specific act. The Court wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To be sure, imprisonment for ninety days is not, in the abstract, a punishment which is either cruel or unusual. But the question cannot be considered in the abstract. Even one day in prison would be a cruel and unusual punishment for the 'crime' of having a common cold.\nHowever, in \"Powell v. Texas\", 392 U.S. https:// (1968), the Court upheld a statute barring public intoxication by distinguishing \"Robinson\" on the basis that \"Powell\" dealt with a person who was drunk \"in public\", not merely for being addicted to alcohol.\nTraditionally, the length of a prison sentence was not subject to scrutiny under the Eighth Amendment, regardless of the crime for which the sentence was imposed. It was not until the case of \"Solem v. Helm\", 463 U.S. https:// (1983), that the Supreme Court held that incarceration, standing alone, could constitute cruel and unusual punishment if it were \"disproportionate\" in duration to the offense. The Court outlined three factors that were to be considered in determining if a sentence is excessive: \"(i) the gravity of the offense and the harshness of the penalty; (ii) the sentences imposed on other criminals in the same jurisdiction; and (iii) the sentences imposed for commission of the same crime in other jurisdictions.\" The Court held that in the circumstances of the case before it and the factors to consider, a sentence of life imprisonment without parole for cashing a $100 check on a closed account was cruel and unusual.\nHowever, in \"Harmelin v. Michigan\", 501 U.S. https:// (1991), a fractured Court retreated from the \"Solem\" test and held that for non-capital sentences, the Eighth Amendment constrains only the length of prison terms by a \"gross disproportionality principle\". Under this principle, the Court sustained a mandatory sentence of life without parole imposed for possession of 672 grams (1.5 pounds) or more of cocaine. The Court acknowledged that a punishment could be cruel but not unusual, and therefore not prohibited by the Constitution. Additionally, in \"Harmelin\", Justice Scalia, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist, said \"the Eighth Amendment contains no proportionality guarantee,\" and that \"what was 'cruel and unusual' under the Eighth Amendment was to be determined without reference to the particular offense.\" Scalia wrote \"If 'cruel and unusual punishments' included disproportionate punishments, the separate prohibition of disproportionate fines (which are certainly punishments) would have been entirely superfluous.\" Moreover, \"There is little doubt that those who framed, proposed, and ratified the Bill of Rights were aware of such provisions [outlawing disproportional punishments], yet chose not to replicate them.\"\nIn \"Graham v. Florida\", 560 U.S. https:// (2010), the Supreme Court declared that a life sentence without any chance of parole, for a crime other than murder, is cruel and unusual punishment for a minor. Two years later, in \"Miller v. Alabama\", 567 U.S. https:// (2012), the Court went further, holding that mandatory life sentences without parole cannot be imposed on minors, even for homicide.\nDeath penalty for rape.\nIn \"Coker v. Georgia\", 433 U.S. https:// (1977), the Court declared that the death penalty was unconstitutionally excessive for rape of a woman and, by implication, for any crime where a death does not occur. The majority in \"Coker\" stated that \"death is indeed a disproportionate penalty for the crime of raping an adult woman.\" The dissent countered that the majority \"takes too little account of the profound suffering the crime imposes upon the victims and their loved ones\". The dissent also characterized the majority as \"myopic\" for considering legal history of only \"the past five years\".\nIn \"Kennedy v. Louisiana\", 554 U.S. https:// (2008), the Court extended the reasoning of \"Coker\" by ruling that the death penalty was excessive for child rape \"where the victim's life was not taken\". The Supreme Court failed to note a federal law, which applies to military court-martial proceedings, providing for the death penalty in cases of child rape. On October 1, 2008, the Court declined to reconsider its opinion in this case, but did amend the majority and dissenting opinions to acknowledge that federal law. Justice Scalia (joined by Chief Justice Roberts) wrote in dissent that \"the proposed Eighth Amendment would have been laughed to scorn if it had read 'no criminal penalty shall be imposed which the Supreme Court deems unacceptable'.\"\nSpecial procedures for death penalty cases.\nJustice Antonin Scalia noted in a concurring opinion in \"Callins v. Collins\" (1994): \"The Fifth Amendment provides that \"[n]o person shall be held to answer for a capital . . . crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, . . . nor be deprived of life . . . without due process of law.\" This clearly permits the death penalty to be imposed, and establishes beyond doubt that the death penalty is not one of the \"cruel and unusual punishments\" prohibited by the Eighth Amendment.\" A similar observation was made by the Supreme Court in 2019. The Supreme Court in \"Bucklew v. Precythe\" (2019) explicitly said: \"The Constitution allows capital punishment. [...] Nor did the later addition of the Eighth Amendment outlaw the practice. [...] While the Eighth Amendment doesn\u2019t forbid capital punishment, it does speak to how States may carry out that punishment, prohibiting methods that are 'cruel and unusual'.\" The Supreme Court also held in \"Bucklew\" that the Due Process Clause expressly allows the death penalty in the United States because \"the Fifth Amendment, added to the Constitution at the same time as the Eighth, expressly contemplates that a defendant may be tried for a 'capital' crime and 'deprived of life' as a penalty, so long as proper procedures are followed\".\nThe first significant general challenge to capital punishment that reached the Supreme Court was the case of \"Furman v. Georgia\", 408 U.S. https:// (1972). The Supreme Court overturned the death sentences of Furman for murder, as well as two other defendants for rape. Of the five justices voting to overturn the death penalty, two found that capital punishment was unconstitutionally cruel and unusual, while three found that the statutes at issue were implemented in a random and capricious fashion, discriminating against blacks and the poor. \"Furman v. Georgia\" did not hold\u2014even though it is sometimes claimed that it did\u2014that capital punishment is \"per se\" unconstitutional.\nStates with capital punishment rewrote their laws to address the Supreme Court's decision, and the Court then revisited the issue in a murder case: \"Gregg v. Georgia\", 428 U.S. https:// (1976). In \"Gregg\", the Court ruled that Georgia's revised death penalty laws passed Eighth Amendment scrutiny: the statutes provided a bifurcated trial in which guilt and sentence were determined separately; and, the statutes provided for \"specific jury findings\" followed by state supreme court review comparing each death sentence \"with the sentences imposed on similarly situated defendants to ensure that the sentence of death in a particular case is not disproportionate.\" Because of the \"Gregg\" decision, executions resumed in 1977.\nSome states have passed laws imposing mandatory death penalties in certain cases. The Supreme Court found these laws unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment, in the murder case of \"Woodson v. North Carolina\", 428 U.S. https:// (1976), because these laws remove discretion from the trial judge to make an individualized determination in each case. Other statutes specifying factors for courts to use in making their decisions have been upheld. Some have not: in \"Godfrey v. Georgia\", 446 U.S. https:// (1980), the Supreme Court overturned a sentence based upon a finding that a murder was \"outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible, and inhuman\", as it deemed that any murder may be reasonably characterized in this manner. Similarly, in \"Maynard v. Cartwright\", 486 U.S. https:// (1988), the Court found that an \"especially heinous, atrocious or cruel\" standard in a homicide case was too vague. However, the meaning of this language depends on how lower courts interpret it. In \"Walton v. Arizona\", 497 U.S. https:// (1990), the Court found that the phrase \"especially heinous, cruel, or depraved\" was not vague in a murder case, because the state supreme court had expounded on its meaning.\nThe Court has generally held that death penalty cases require extra procedural protections. As the Court said in \"Herrera v. Collins\", 506 U.S. https:// (1993), which involved the murder of a police officer, \"the Eighth Amendment requires increased reliability of the process...\"\nPunishments specifically allowed.\nIn \"Wilkerson v. Utah\", 99 U.S. https:// (1878) the Court stated that death by firing squad is not cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment.\nIn \"Rummel v. Estelle\", 445 U.S. https:// (1980), the Court upheld a life sentence with the possibility of parole imposed per Texas's three strikes law for fraud crimes totaling $230. A few months later, Rummel challenged his sentence for ineffective assistance of counsel, his appeal was upheld, and as part of a plea bargain Rummel pled guilty to theft and was released for time served.\nIn \"Harmelin v. Michigan\", 501 U.S. https:// (1991), the Court upheld a life sentence without the possibility of parole for possession of 672\u00a0grams (1.5 pounds) of cocaine.\nIn \"Lockyer v. Andrade\", 538 U.S. https:// (2003), the Court upheld a 50 years to life sentence with the possibility of parole imposed under California's three strikes law when the defendant was convicted of shoplifting videotapes worth a total of about $150.\nIn \"Baze v. Rees\", 553 U.S. https:// (2008) the Court upheld Kentucky's execution protocol using a three-drug cocktail.\nIn \"Glossip v. Gross\" 576 U.S. https:// (2015) the Court upheld the use of lethal injections using the drug midazolam.\nJustice Antonin Scalia noted in a concurring opinion in \"Callins v. Collins\" (1994): \"The Fifth Amendment provides that \"[n]o person shall be held to answer for a capital . . . crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, . . . nor be deprived of life . . . without due process of law.\" This clearly permits the death penalty to be imposed, and establishes beyond doubt that the death penalty is not one of the \"cruel and unusual punishments\" prohibited by the Eighth Amendment.\" A similar observation was made by the Supreme Court in 2019. In \"Bucklew v. Precythe\", 587 U.S. ___ (2019) the Court ruled that when a convict sentenced to death challenges the State's method of execution due to claims of excessive pain, the convict must show that other alternative methods of execution exist and clearly demonstrate they would cause less pain than the state-determined one. The Supreme Court also held in \"Bucklew\" that the Due Process Clause expressly allows the death penalty in the United States because \"the Fifth Amendment, added to the Constitution at the same time as the Eighth, expressly contemplates that a defendant may be tried for a 'capital' crime and 'deprived of life' as a penalty, so long as proper procedures are followed\". The Court also explicitly said: \"The Constitution allows capital punishment. [...] Nor did the later addition of the Eighth Amendment outlaw the practice. [...] Of course, that doesn't mean the American people must continue to use the death penalty. The same Constitution that permits States to authorize capital punishment also allows them to outlaw it. But it does mean that the judiciary bears no license to end a debate reserved for the people and their representatives. While the Eighth Amendment doesn\u2019t forbid capital punishment, it does speak to how States may carry out that punishment, prohibiting methods that are 'cruel and unusual'.\"\nEvolving standards of decency.\nIn \"Trop v. Dulles\", 356 U.S. https:// (1958), Chief Justice Earl Warren said: \"The [Eighth] Amendment must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\" Subsequently, the Court has looked to societal developments, as well as looking to its own independent judgment, in determining what are those \"evolving standards of decency\". In \"Kennedy v. Louisiana\" (2008) the Supreme Court stated: \"Evolving standards of decency must embrace and express respect for the dignity of the person, and the punishment of criminals must conform to that rule.\"\nOriginalists, like Justice Antonin Scalia, argue that societies may rot instead of maturing and may decrease in virtue or wisdom instead of increasing. Thus, they say, the framers wanted the amendment understood as it was written and ratified, instead of morphing as times change, and in any event legislators are more competent than judges to take the pulse of the public as to changing standards of decency.\nThe \"evolving standards\" test has been subject to scholarly criticism. For example, law professor John Stinneford asserts that the \"evolving standards\" test misinterprets the Eighth Amendment:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Framers of the Bill of Rights understood the word \"unusual\" to mean \"contrary to long usage.\" Recognition of the word's original meaning will precisely invert the \"evolving standards of decency\" test, and ask the Court to compare challenged punishments with the longstanding principles and precedents of the common law, rather than shifting and nebulous notions of \"societal consensus\" and contemporary \"standards of decency.\nOn the other hand, law professor Dennis Baker defends the evolving standards of decency test as advancing the moral purpose of the Eighth Amendment to ban the inflicting of unjust, oppressive, or disproportional punishments by a state on its citizens.\nProportionality.\nThe Supreme Court has applied evolving standards not only to say what punishments are inherently cruel, but also to say what punishments that are not inherently cruel are nevertheless \"grossly disproportionate\" to the offense in question. An example can be seen in \"Jackson v. Bishop\" an Eighth Circuit decision outlawing corporal punishment in the Arkansas prison system: \"The scope of the Amendment is not static...[D]isproportion, both among punishments and between punishment and crime, is a factor to be considered...\" The Supreme court observed in \"Weems v. United States\" (1910) that \"it is a precept of justice that punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned to offense.\" Relying on and citing its early cases \"O'Neil v. Vermont\", 144 U.S. https:// (1892) and \"Weems v. United States\" the Supreme Court concluded in \"Enmund v. Florida\" that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause is partly a prohibition of all punishments which, by their excessive length or severity, are greatly disproportioned to the offenses charged.\nLaw professor John Stinneford asserts that the Eighth Amendment forbids punishments that are very disproportionate to the offense, even if the punishment by itself is not intrinsically barbaric, but he argues that \"proportionality is to be measured primarily in terms of prior practice\" according to the word \"unusual\" in the amendment, instead of being measured according to shifting and nebulous evolving standards. Stinneford argues that the word \"unusual\" in the Eighth Amendment has a very different meaning in comparison to those who use originalism to interpret the U.S. Constitution. He writes: \"But in reality, the word 'unusual' in the Eighth Amendment did not originally mean 'rare'\u2013 it meant 'contrary to long usage', or 'new'. A punishment is cruel and unusual if it is 'cruel in light of long usage' \u2013 that is, cruel in comparison to longstanding prior practice or tradition.\" Similarly, law professor John Bessler points to \"An Essay on Crimes and Punishments\", written by Cesare Beccaria in the 1760s, which advocated proportionate punishments; many of the Founding Fathers, including Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, read Beccaria's treatise and were influenced by it.\nThus, Stinneford and Bessler disagree with the view of Justice Scalia, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist, in \"Harmelin v. Michigan\" where they denied that the Punishments Clause contains any proportionality principle. With Scalia and Rehnquist, Richard Epstein argues that the amendment does not refer broadly to the imposition of penalties, but rather refers more narrowly to the penalties themselves; Epstein says judges who favor the broad view tend to omit the letter \"s\" at the end of the word \"punishments\".\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31661", "revid": "33575317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31661", "title": "Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution", "text": "1791 amendment regarding unenumerated rights in the United States\nThe Ninth Amendment (Amendment IX) to the United States Constitution addresses rights, retained by the people, that are not specifically enumerated in the Constitution. It is part of the Bill of Rights. The amendment was introduced during the drafting of the Bill of Rights when some of the American founders became concerned that future generations might argue that, because a certain right was not listed in the Bill of Rights, it did not exist. However, the Ninth Amendment has rarely played any role in U.S. constitutional law, and until the 1980s was often considered \"forgotten\" or \"irrelevant\" by many legal academics.\nIn \"United Public Workers v. Mitchell\" (1947), the U.S. Supreme Court held that rights contained in the 9th or 10th amendments could not be used to challenge the exercise of enumerated powers by the government: \"If granted power is found, necessarily the objection of invasion of those rights, reserved by the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, must fail.\" Some scholars have taken a different position and challenged the Court's reasoning, while other scholars have agreed with the Court\u2019s reasoning.\nIn \"Griswold v. Connecticut\" (1965), the Court held that the 9th and 14th amendments support a right to privacy, which is not enumerated in the Bill of Rights. Justice Arthur Goldberg wrote in his concurrence that the Ninth Amendment was sufficient authority on its own to support the Court's finding of a fundamental right to marital privacy.\nText.\nThe amendment, as proposed by Congress in 1789 and later ratified as the Ninth Amendment, reads as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\nBackground before adoption.\nWhen the U.S. Constitution was put to the states for ratification after being signed on September 17, 1787, the Anti-Federalists argued that a bill of rights should be added. One of the arguments the Federalists gave against the addition of a bill of rights, during the debates about ratification of the Constitution, was that a listing of rights could problematically enlarge the powers specified in of the new Constitution by implication. For example, in Federalist , Alexander Hamilton asked, \"Why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do?\" Likewise, James Madison explained to Thomas Jefferson, \"I conceive that in a certain degree... the rights in question are reserved by the manner in which the federal powers are granted\" by Article One, Section8 of the Constitution.\nThe Anti-Federalists persisted in favor of a bill of rights during the ratification debates, but also were against ratification, and consequently several of the state ratification conventions gave their assent with accompanying resolutions proposing amendments to be added. In 1788, the Virginia Ratifying Convention attempted to solve the problem that Hamilton and the Federalists had identified by proposing a constitutional amendment specifying:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;That those clauses which declare that Congress shall not exercise certain powers be not interpreted in any manner whatsoever to extend the powers of Congress. But that they may be construed either as making exceptions to the specified powers where this shall be the case, or otherwise as inserted merely for greater caution.\nThis proposal ultimately led to the Ninth Amendment. In 1789, while introducing to the House of Representatives nineteen draft Amendments, James Madison addressed what would become the Ninth Amendment as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It has been objected also against a Bill of Rights, that, by enumerating particular exceptions to the grant of power, it would disparage those rights which were not placed in that enumeration; and it might follow by implication, that those rights which were not singled out, were intended to be assigned into the hands of the General Government, and were consequently insecure. This is one of the most plausible arguments I have ever heard against the admission of a bill of rights into this system; but, I conceive, that it may be guarded against. I have attempted it, as gentlemen may see by turning to the last clause of the fourth resolution.\nLike Alexander Hamilton, Madison was concerned that enumerating various rights could \"enlarge the powers delegated by the constitution\". To attempt to solve this problem, Madison submitted this draft to Congress:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThis was an intermediate form of the Ninth Amendment that borrowed from the Virginia proposal, while foreshadowing the final version.\nThe final text of the Ninth Amendment, like Madison's draft, speaks of other rights than those enumerated in the Constitution. The character of those other rights was indicated by Madison in his speech introducing the Bill of Rights (emphasis added):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe First through Eighth Amendments address the means by which the federal government exercises its enumerated powers, while the Ninth Amendment addresses a \"great residuum\" of rights that have not been \"thrown into the hands of the government\", as Madison put it. The Ninth Amendment became part of the Constitution on December 15, 1791, upon ratification by three-fourths of the states.\nThe final form of the amendment ratified by the states is as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\nJudicial interpretation.\nThe courts have generally not regarded the Ninth Amendment as either limiting governmental power, or justifying its expansion. As the U.S. Supreme Court put it in \"U.S. Public Workers v. Mitchell\" 330 U.S. https:// (1947): \"If granted power is found, necessarily the objection of invasion of those rights, reserved by the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, must fail.\"\nThe Supreme Court held in \"Barron v. Baltimore\" (1833) that the Bill of Rights was enforceable by the federal courts only against the federal government, not against the states. Thus, the Ninth Amendment originally applied only to the federal government, which is a government of enumerated powers.\nSome jurists have asserted that the Ninth Amendment is relevant to the interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Arthur Goldberg (joined by Chief Justice Earl Warren and Justice William Brennan) expressed this view in a concurring opinion in the case of \"Griswold v. Connecticut\" (1965):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[...]the Framers did not intend that the first eight amendments be construed to exhaust the basic and fundamental rights which the Constitution guaranteed to the people. [...]I do not mean to imply that the Ninth Amendment is applied against the States by the Fourteenth. [...]Nor do I mean to state that the Ninth Amendment constitutes an independent source of rights protected from infringement by either the States or the Federal Government.\nWhile the Ninth Amendment\u2014and indeed the entire Bill of Rights\u2014originally concerned restrictions upon federal power, the subsequently enacted Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the States as well from abridging fundamental personal liberties. And the Ninth Amendment, in indicating that not all such liberties are specifically mentioned in the first eight amendments, is surely relevant in showing the existence of other fundamental personal rights, now protected from state, as well as federal, infringement. In sum, the Ninth Amendment simply lends strong support to the view that the \"liberty\" protected by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments from infringement by the Federal Government or the States is not restricted to rights specifically mentioned in the first eight amendments. Cf. \"United Public Workers v. Mitchell\", 330 U. S. 75, 330 U.S. 94-95.\nIn support of his interpretation of the Ninth, Goldberg quoted from Madison's speech in the House of Representatives as well as from Alexander Hamilton's \"Federalist Paper\" No. 84:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I go further and affirm that bills of rights, in the sense and in the extent in which they are contended for, are not only unnecessary in the proposed constitution, but would even be dangerous. They would contain various exceptions to powers which are not granted, and, on this very account, would afford a colorable pretext to claim more than were granted. For why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do? Why, for instance, should it be said that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained when no power is given by which restrictions may be imposed? I will not contend that such a provision would confer a regulating power; but it is evident that it would furnish, to men disposed to usurp, a plausible pretense for claiming that power.\nThe two dissenting Justices in \"Griswold\" replied that Goldberg was mistaken to invoke the Ninth as authority. Hugo Black's dissent said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;My Brother GOLDBERG has adopted the recent discovery that the Ninth Amendment, as well as the Due Process Clause, can be used by this Court as authority to strike down all state legislation which this Court thinks violates \"fundamental principles of liberty and justice\", or is contrary to the \"traditions and [collective] conscience of our people\".\u00a0... [O]ne would certainly have to look far beyond the language of the Ninth Amendment to find that the Framers vested in this Court any such awesome veto powers over lawmaking, either by the States or by the Congress. Nor does anything in the history of the Amendment offer any support for such a shocking doctrine. The whole history of the adoption of the Constitution and Bill of Rights points the other way, and the very material quoted by my Brother GOLDBERG shows that the Ninth Amendment was intended to protect against the idea that, \"by enumerating particular exceptions to the grant of power\" to the Federal Government, \"those rights which were not singled out were intended to be assigned into the hands of the General Government [the United States], and were consequently insecure.\" That Amendment was passed not to broaden the powers of this Court or any other department of \"the General Government\", but, as every student of history knows, to assure the people that the Constitution in all its provisions was intended to limit the Federal Government to the powers granted expressly or by necessary implication.\u00a0... [F]or a period of a century and a half, no serious suggestion was ever made that the Ninth Amendment, enacted to protect state powers against federal invasion, could be used as a weapon of federal power to prevent state legislatures from passing laws they consider appropriate to govern local affairs.\nAnd Potter Stewart's dissent said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[T]o say that the Ninth Amendment has anything to do with this case is to turn somersaults with history. The Ninth Amendment, like its companion, the Tenth, which this Court held \"states but a truism that all is retained which has not been surrendered\", \"United States v. Darby\", 312 U.S. 100, 312 U.S. 124, was framed by James Madison and adopted by the States simply to make clear that the adoption of the Bill of Rights did not alter the plan that the \"Federal\" Government was to be a government of express and limited powers, and that all rights and powers not delegated to it were retained by the people and the individual States. Until today, no member of this Court has ever suggested that the Ninth Amendment meant anything else, and the idea that a federal court could ever use the Ninth Amendment to annul a law passed by the elected representatives of the people of the State of Connecticut would have caused James Madison no little wonder.\nSince \"Griswold\", some judges have attempted to use the Ninth Amendment to justify judicially enforcing other unenumerated rights. For example, the District Court that heard the case of \"Roe v. Wade\" ruled in favor of a \"Ninth Amendment right to choose to have an abortion\", although it stressed that the right was \"not unqualified or unfettered\". However, Justice William O. Douglas rejected that view; Douglas wrote that \"The Ninth Amendment obviously does not create federally enforceable rights.\" See \"Doe v. Bolton\" (1973). Douglas joined the majority opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court in \"Roe\", which stated that a federally enforceable right to privacy, \"whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in the Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.\"\nThe Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals stated in \"Gibson v. Matthews\", 926 F.2d 532, 537 (6th Cir. 1991) that the Ninth Amendment was intended to vitiate the maxim of \"expressio unius est exclusio alterius\" according to which the express mention of one thing excludes all others:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[T]he ninth amendment does not confer substantive rights in addition to those conferred by other portions of our governing law. The ninth amendment was added to the Bill of Rights to ensure that the maxim \"expressio unius est exclusio alterius\" would not be used at a later time to deny fundamental rights merely because they were not specifically enumerated in the Constitution.\nJustice Antonin Scalia expressed the view, in the dissenting opinion of \"\", 530 U.S. https:// (2000), that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Declaration of Independence\u00a0... is not a legal prescription conferring powers upon the courts; and the Constitution's refusal to \"deny or disparage\" other rights is far removed from affirming any one of them, and even farther removed from authorizing judges to identify what they might be, and to enforce the judges' list against laws duly enacted by the people.\nScholarly interpretation.\nProfessor Laurence Tribe shares the view that this amendment does not confer substantive rights: \"It is a common error, but an error nonetheless, to talk of 'ninth amendment rights.' The ninth amendment is not a source of rights as such; it is simply a rule about how to read the Constitution.\"\nIn 2000, Harvard historian Bernard Bailyn gave a speech at the White House on the subject of the Ninth Amendment. He said that the Ninth Amendment refers to \"a universe of rights, possessed by the people\u00a0\u2013 latent rights, still to be evoked and enacted into law\u00a0... a reservoir of other, unenumerated rights that the people retain, which in time may be enacted into law\". Similarly, journalist Brian Doherty has argued that the Ninth Amendment \"specifically roots the Constitution in a natural rights tradition that says we are born with more rights than any constitution could ever list or specify.\"\nRobert Bork, often considered an originalist, stated during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing that a judge should not apply a constitutional provision like this one if he does not know what it means; the example Bork then gave was a clause covered by an inkblot. Upon further study, Bork later ascribed a meaning to the Ninth Amendment in his book \"The Tempting of America\". In that book, Bork subscribed to the interpretation of constitutional historian Russell Caplan, who asserted that this Amendment was meant to ensure that the federal Bill of Rights would not affect provisions in state law that restrain state governments.\nA libertarian originalist, Randy Barnett has argued that the Ninth Amendment requires what he calls a presumption of liberty. Barnett also argues that the Ninth Amendment prevents the government from invalidating a ruling by either a jury or lower court through strict interpretation of the Bill of Rights. According to Barnett, \"The purpose of the Ninth Amendment was to ensure that all individual natural rights had the same stature and force after some of them were enumerated as they had before.\"\nAccording to professor and former Circuit Judge Michael W. McConnell,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[T]he rights retained by the people are indeed individual natural rights, but those rights enjoy precisely the same status and are protected in the same way, as before the Bill of Rights was added to the Constitution. They are not relinquished, denied, or disparaged. Nor do natural rights become \"constitutional rights.\" They are simply what all retained rights were before the enactment of the Bill of Rights: a guide to equitable interpretation and a rationale for the narrow construction of statutes that might be thought to infringe them, but not superior to explicit positive law. This understanding of the relation of unenumerated natural rights to a positive law closely resembles the relationship between common law and legislation: the common law governs in the absence of contrary legislation, and sometimes even guides or limits the interpretation of ambiguous or overbroad statutes, but does not prevail in the teeth of specific statutory overrides.\nThis mode of interpretation offers a middle way between the two usual poles of unenumerated rights jurisprudence. One pole maintains that if a claimed right cannot be found in the Constitution, even applying a liberal construction to its terms, it is entitled to no protection at all\u00a0... The other pole maintains that there are unwritten natural rights whose content must inevitably be determined, finally and without the possibility of legislative override, by judges. These rights then receive full constitutional protection even when the representatives of the people have reached the contrary conclusion\u00a0... If I am correct about the meaning of the Ninth Amendment, neither of these approaches is entirely correct. Rather, an assertion of a natural right (generally founded on common law or other long-standing practice) will be judicially enforceable unless there is specific and explicit positive law to the contrary. This allows the representatives of the people, rather than members of the judiciary, to make the ultimate determination of when natural rights should yield to the peace, safety, and happiness of society.\nStill others, such as Thomas B. McAffee, have argued that the Ninth Amendment protects the unenumerated \"residuum\" of rights which the federal government was never empowered to violate.\nAccording to lawyer and diplomat Frederic Jesup Stimson, the framers of the Constitution and the Ninth Amendment intended that no rights that they already held would be lost through omission. Law professor Charles Lund Black took a similar position, though Stimson and Black respectively acknowledged that their views differed from the modern view, and differed from the prevalent view in academic writing.\nGun rights activists in recent decades have sometimes argued for a fundamental natural right to keep and bear arms in the United States that both predates the U.S. Constitution and is covered by the Constitution's Ninth Amendment; according to this viewpoint, the Second Amendment only enumerates a pre-existing right to keep and bear arms.\nState constitutions.\nThirty-three states have constitutions that include language virtually identical to the Ninth Amendment. Often called \"Baby Ninth Amendments\", state courts have often\u2014unlike federal courts and the Ninth Amendment\u2014interpreted these provisions to protect unenumerated rights. Rights state courts have said Baby Ninth Amendments protect include: the right to earn a living, the right to open a school, and the right to refuse medical treatment. Alabama and Maine adopted the first \"Baby Ninths\" in 1819 and the latest state to adopt a new one was Illinois in 1970.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It expresses the principle of federalism, whereby the federal government and the individual states share power, by mutual agreement. The Tenth Amendment prescribes that the federal government has only those powers delegated to it by the Constitution, and that all other powers not forbidden to the states by the Constitution are reserved to each state, or to the people.\nThe amendment, with origins before the American Revolution, was proposed by the 1st United States Congress in 1789 during its first term following the adoption of the Constitution. It was considered by many members as a prerequisite before they would ratify the Constitution, and particularly to satisfy demands of Anti-Federalists, who opposed the creation of a stronger federal government.\nThe purpose of this amendment is to reaffirm the principles of federalism and reinforce the notion of the federal government maintaining only limited, enumerated powers. Some legal scholars (including textualists and originalists) have effectively classified the amendment as a tautology, a statement affirming that the federal government does not have any rights that it does not have.\nText.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\nDrafting and adoption.\nThe Tenth Amendment is similar to Article II of the Articles of Confederation:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; Thomas Burke, a vehement supporter of states' rights in the Continental Congress, originally proposed the text of what would later become the Tenth Amendment as an amendment to the Articles of Confederation. Thomas Burke wanted to ensure that there was no ambiguity concerning differences in state or federal power. Other Founding Fathers of the United States disagreed with this amendment, including James Wilson, John Dickinson (who drafted the Articles of Confederation), and Richard Henry Lee. Nevertheless, the amendment was passed by the Continental Congress.\nAfter the American Revolution, with the completion of the drafting and ratification of the Constitution, South Carolina Representative Thomas Tudor Tucker and Massachusetts Representative Elbridge Gerry separately proposed similar amendments limiting the federal government to powers \"expressly\" delegated, which would have denied implied powers. James Madison opposed the amendments, stating that \"it was impossible to confine a Government to the exercise of express powers; there must necessarily be admitted powers by implication, unless the Constitution descended to recount every minutia.\" When a vote on this version of the amendment with \"expressly delegated\" was defeated, Connecticut Representative Roger Sherman drafted the Tenth Amendment in its ratified form, omitting \"expressly\". Sherman's language allowed for an expansive reading of the powers implied by the Necessary and Proper Clause.\nWhen James Madison introduced the Tenth Amendment in Congress, he explained that many states were eager to ratify this amendment, despite critics who deemed the amendment superfluous or unnecessary:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I find, from looking into the amendments proposed by the State conventions, that several are particularly anxious that it should be declared in the Constitution, that the powers not therein delegated should be reserved to the several States. Perhaps words which may define this more precisely than the whole of the instrument now does, may be considered as superfluous. I admit they may be deemed unnecessary: but there can be no harm in making such a declaration, if gentlemen will allow that the fact is as stated. I am sure I understand it so, and do therefore propose it.\nThe states ratified the Tenth Amendment, declining to signal that there are unenumerated powers in addition to unenumerated rights. The amendment rendered unambiguous what had previously been at most a mere suggestion or an implication.\nJudicial interpretation.\nThe Tenth Amendment, which makes explicit the idea that the powers of the federal government are limited to those powers granted in the Constitution, has been declared to be a truism by the Supreme Court. In \"United States v. Sprague\" (1932) the Supreme Court asserted that the amendment \"added nothing to the [Constitution] as originally ratified.\"\nStates and local governments have occasionally attempted to assert exemption from various federal regulations, especially in the areas of labor and environmental controls, using the Tenth Amendment as a basis for their claim. An often-repeated quote, from \"United States v. Darby Lumber Co.\", reads as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The amendment states but a truism that all is retained which has not been surrendered. There is nothing in the history of its adoption to suggest that it was more than declaratory of the relationship between the national and state governments as it had been established by the Constitution before the amendment or that its purpose was other than to allay fears that the new national government might seek to exercise powers not granted, and that the states might not be able to exercise fully their reserved powers.\nIn \"Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority\" (1985), the Court overruled \"National League of Cities v. Usery\" (1976). Under \"National League of Cities\", the determination of whether there was state immunity from federal regulation turned on whether the state activity was \"traditional\" for or \"integral\" to the state government. In \"Garcia\", the Court noted that this analysis was \"unsound in principle and unworkable in practice\", and concluded that the Framers believed state sovereignty could be maintained by the political system established by the Constitution. Noting that the same Congress that extended the Fair Labor Standards Act to cover government-run mass transit systems also provided substantial funding for those systems, the Court concluded that the structure created by the Framers had indeed protected the states from overreaching by the federal government.\nIn \"South Carolina v. Baker\" (1988), the Court said in \"dicta\" that an exception to \"Garcia\" would be when a state lacked \"any right to participate\" in the federal political process or was left \"politically isolated and powerless\" by a federal law.\nCommandeering.\nSince 1992, the Supreme Court has ruled that the Tenth Amendment prohibits the federal government from forcing states to pass or not pass certain legislation, or to enforce federal law.\nIn \"New York v. United States\" (1992), the Supreme Court invalidated part of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985. The act provided three incentives for states to comply with statutory obligations to provide for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste. The first two incentives were monetary. The third, which was challenged in this case, obliged states to take title to any waste within their borders that had not been disposed of prior to January 1, 1996, and made each state liable for all damages directly related to such waste. The Court ruled that imposing that obligation on a state violated the Tenth Amendment. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote that the federal government can encourage the states to adopt certain regulations through the spending power (e.g., by attaching conditions to the receipt of federal funds, see \"South Dakota v. Dole\",) or through the commerce power (which allows it directly to preempt state law). However, Congress cannot directly compel states to enforce federal regulations.\nIn \"Printz v. United States\" (1997), the Court ruled that part of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act violated the Tenth Amendment. The act required state and local law enforcement officials to conduct background checks on people attempting to purchase handguns. Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the majority, applied \"New York v. United States\" to conclude that the act violated the Tenth Amendment. Since the act \"forced participation of the State's executive in the actual administration of a federal program\", it was unconstitutional.\nIn \"Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association\" (2018), the Supreme Court ruled that the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992, which prohibited states that had banned sports betting when the law was enacted from later legalizing it, violated the anti-commandeering doctrine, and invalidated the entire law. The Court ruled that the anti-commandeering doctrine applied to congressional attempts to prevent the states from taking a certain action as much as it applied in \"New York\" and \"Printz\" to Congress requiring states to enforce federal law.\nCommerce Clause.\nIn the 20th century, the Commerce Clause became one of the most frequently-used sources of Congress's power. Its interpretation is important in determining the allowable scope of federal government. Complex economic challenges arising from the Great Depression triggered a reevaluation in both Congress and the Supreme Court of the use of Commerce Clause powers to maintain a strong national economy.\nIn \"Wickard v. Filburn\" (1942), in the context of World War II, the Court ruled that federal regulation of wheat production could constitutionally be applied to wheat grown for \"home consumption\" on a farm (i.e., fed to animals or otherwise consumed on the premises). The rationale was that a farmer's growing \"his own\" can have a substantial cumulative effect on interstate commerce, because if all farmers were to exceed their production quotas, a significant amount of wheat would either not be sold on the market or would be bought from other producers. Hence, in the aggregate, if farmers were allowed to consume their own wheat, it would affect the interstate market.\nIn \"United States v. Lopez\" (1995), a federal law mandating a \"gun-free zone\" on and around public school campuses was struck down. The Supreme Court ruled that there was no clause in the Constitution authorizing the federal law. This was the first modern Supreme Court opinion to limit the government's power under the Commerce Clause. The opinion did not mention the Tenth Amendment or the Court's 1985 \"Garcia\" decision.\nMost recently, in \"Gonzales v. Raich\" (2005), a California woman sued the Drug Enforcement Administration after her medical cannabis crop was seized and destroyed by federal agents. Medical cannabis was explicitly made legal under California state law by Proposition 215, despite cannabis being prohibited at the federal level by the Controlled Substances Act. Even though the woman grew cannabis strictly for her own consumption and never sold any, the Supreme Court stated that growing one's own cannabis \"affects\" the interstate market of cannabis. In theory the product \"could\" enter the stream of interstate commerce, even if it clearly had not been grown for that purpose and was unlikely ever to reach any market (the same reasoning as in \"Wickard v. Filburn\"). It therefore ruled that this practice may be regulated by the federal government under the Commerce Clause.\nSupremacy Clause.\nIn \"Cooper v. Aaron\" (1958), the Supreme Court dealt with states' rights and the Tenth Amendment. The case came about when conflicts arose in direct response to the ruling of another landmark case, \"Brown v. Board of Education\" (1954). In \"Brown\", the Supreme Court unanimously declared racial segregation of children in public schools unconstitutional. Following \"Brown\", the court ordered district courts and school boards to proceed with desegregation \"with all deliberate speed\".\nAmong those opposing the decision (and all efforts of desegregation) was the Governor of Arkansas, Orval Faubus. A group of black students known as the Little Rock Nine were to attend the previously all-white Central High School under the school board's attempt to follow the order of \"Brown\". The tension became severe when Governor Faubus ordered the National Guard to prevent the nine from entering the school and President Eisenhower responded with federal troops to escort them.\nFive months after the integration crisis happened, the school board filed suit in the United States District Court of the Eastern District of Arkansas requesting a two-and-a-half-year delay in implementing desegregation. Although the district court granted the relief, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed the district court's decision on August 18, 1958, and stayed its mandate pending appeal to the Supreme Court. By this time, the incident had evolved into a national issue: it had become a debate not only on racism and segregation but also on states' rights and the Tenth Amendment.\nThe Court cited the Supremacy Clause of Article VI, which declares the Constitution to be the supreme law of the land, and \"Marbury v. Madison\" in holding that the states must abide by the Court's decision in \"Brown\". Expectedly, many states' right advocates and state officials criticized the ruling as an attack on the Tenth Amendment. Moreover, they claimed the Court's decision on \"Cooper\" as being inconsistent with the constitutional vision of the Framers.\nNullification and interposition.\nNullification refers to a legal theory suggesting that states may evaluate the legality of federal laws and declare them unconstitutional with respect to the US Constitution. The intended effect is to invalidate (nullify) the laws within the state's boundaries. A related notion of interposition refers to a belief that it is a right of a state to thwart enforcement of federal laws that the state considers unconstitutional and as such are harmful to its inhabitants. The state is said to be \"interposing\" itself between the federal government and the people of the state.\nThe concept of nullification stems from the so-called compact theory suggesting that because the states created the federal government by agreement (\"compact\") to join the Union, they alone can determine how much power they delegate to the federal authorities. This is in opposition to the current practice where only federal courts perform judicial review of allegedly offending federal laws. James Madison and Thomas Jefferson drafted the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions that lay the bedrock for arguments for nullification. In the 19th century, several states relied on this interpretation to declare nullification of federal laws or decisions of the US Supreme Court, but the Supreme Court struck down all such efforts. Among the most famous was the Nullification Crisis, when South Carolina declared the tariffs of 1828 and 1832 void in the state, but it was resolved when tariffs were lowered to South Carolina's satisfaction and when President Andrew Jackson threatened military intervention unless the state relented. The Civil War, however, ended all appeals to state sovereignty and the Supreme Court's authority as the highest interpreter of constitutional law stopped to be challenged.\nThe idea of nullification gained new traction in the 1950s as the Supreme Court ordered desegregation of schools in \"Brown v. Board of Education\", and Southern states in response mounted a campaign of massive resistance to oppose it, arguing that federal desegregation orders infringed on states' rights. Ten ex-Confederate states passed declarations of interposition to oppose these efforts. But the Supreme court in \"Cooper v. Aaron\" rejected the declarations and held nullification and interposition impermissible.\nToday, laws that appear to circumvent some Supreme Court decisions or federal law may sometimes be called laws of nullification, including in cases if they do not explicitly urge to defy federal law or resist federal authority. Examples of this usage include the Texas Heartbeat Act and the Missouri Second Amendment Preservation Act or immigration and marijuana laws.\nFederal funding.\nThe federal system limits the ability of the federal government to use state governments as an instrument of the national government, as held in \"Printz v. United States\".\nFor this reason, Congress often seeks to exercise its powers by encouraging States to implement national programs consistent with national minimum standards; a system known as cooperative federalism. One example of the exercise of this device was to condition allocation of federal funding where certain state laws do not conform to federal guidelines. For example, federal educational funds may not be accepted without implementation of special education programs in compliance with IDEA. Similarly, the nationwide state 55\u00a0mph (89\u00a0km/h) speed limit, 0.08 legal blood alcohol limit, and the nationwide state 21-year drinking age were imposed through this method; the states would lose highway funding if they refused to pass such laws (though the national speed limit has since been repealed).\nIn \"National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius\" (2012), the Court ruled that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly referred to as the ACA or Obamacare) unconstitutionally coerced the states to expand Medicaid. The Court classified the ACA's language as coercive because it effectively forced States to join the federal program by conditioning the continued provision of Medicaid funds on states agreeing to materially alter Medicaid eligibility to include all individuals who fell below 133% of the poverty line.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Eleventh Amendment restricts the ability of individuals to bring suit against states of which they are not citizens in federal court.\nThe Eleventh Amendment was adopted to overrule the Supreme Court's decision in \"Chisholm v. Georgia\" (1793). In that case, the Court held that states did not enjoy sovereign immunity from suits made by citizens of other states in federal court. Although the Eleventh Amendment established that federal courts do not have the authority to hear cases brought by private parties against a state of which they are not citizens, the Supreme Court has ruled the amendment applies to all federal suits against states brought by private parties. The Supreme Court has also held that Congress can abrogate state sovereign immunity when using its authority under Section5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Other recent cases (\"Torres v. Texas Department of Public Safety\", \"Central Virginia Community College v. Katz\", \"PennEast Pipeline Co. v. New Jersey\") have identified further exceptions to the general sovereign immunity of states when Congress acts pursuant to its Article I powers, which have alternatively been referred to as \"waivers in the plan of the Convention\". The Supreme Court has also held that federal courts can enjoin state officials from violating federal law.\nText.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\nBackground.\nThe Eleventh Amendment was the first Constitutional amendment adopted after the Bill of Rights. The amendment was adopted following the Supreme Court's ruling in \"Chisholm v. Georgia\", 2 U.S. https:// (1793). In \"Chisholm\", the Court ruled that federal courts had the authority to hear cases in law and equity brought by private citizens against states and that states did not enjoy sovereign immunity from suits made by citizens of other states in federal court. Thus, the amendment clarified Article III, Section2 of the Constitution, which gives diversity jurisdiction to the judiciary to hear cases \"between a state and citizens of another state.\"\nProposal and ratification.\nThe Eleventh Amendment was proposed by the 3rd Congress on March 4, 1794, when it was approved by the House of Representatives by vote of 81\u20139, having been previously passed by the Senate, 23\u20132, on January 14, 1794. The amendment was ratified by the state legislatures of the following states:\nThere were fifteen states at the time; ratification by twelve added the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution. (South Carolina ratified it on December 4, 1797.)\nOn January 8, 1798, approximately three years after the Eleventh Amendment's actual adoption, President John Adams stated in a message to Congress that it had been ratified by the necessary number of states and was now a part of the Constitution. New Jersey and Pennsylvania did not take action on the amendment during that era; neither did Tennessee, which had become the 16th state on June 1, 1796. However, on June 25, 2018, the New Jersey Senate adopted Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 75 to ratify the Eleventh Amendment.\nImpact.\nAlmost exactly three years after its ratification, the U.S. Supreme Court decision in \"Hollingsworth v. Virginia\", 3 U.S. https:// (1798) resulted in every pending action brought under \"Chisholm\" being dismissed due to the amendment's adoption.\nSovereign immunity.\nThe amendment's text does not mention suits brought against a state by its own citizens. However, in \"Hans v. Louisiana\", 134 U.S. https:// (1890), the Supreme Court ruled that the amendment reflects a broader principle of sovereign immunity. As Justice Anthony Kennedy later stated in \"Alden v. Maine\", 527 U.S. https:// (1999):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHowever, Justice David Souter, writing for a four-Justice dissent in \"Alden\", said the states surrendered their sovereign immunity when they ratified the Constitution. He read the amendment's text as reflecting a narrow form of sovereign immunity that limited only the diversity jurisdiction of the federal courts. He concluded that neither the Eleventh Amendment in particular nor the Constitution in general insulates the states from suits by individuals.\nApplication to federal law.\nAlthough the Eleventh Amendment grants immunity to states from suit for money damages or equitable relief without their consent, in \"Ex parte Young\", 209 U.S. https:// (1908), the Supreme Court ruled that federal courts may enjoin state officials from violating federal law. The Court's ruling in \"Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer\", 427 U.S. https:// (1976) allows Congress to abrogate state immunity from suit under ; this was broadened to include bankruptcy cases by \"Central Virginia Community College v. Katz\", 546 U.S. https:// (2006), based on of the Constitution. In \"Lapides v. Board of Regents of University System of Georgia\", 535 U.S. https:// (2002), the Supreme Court ruled that when a state invokes a federal court's removal jurisdiction, it waives the Eleventh Amendment in the removed case.\nTerritorial application.\nThe amendment's applicability to unincorporated U.S. territories, where constitutional rights do not fully apply, remained unclear for nearly two centuries after its ratification. In 1983, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit ruled that Puerto Rico enjoys Eleventh Amendment immunity. However, subsequent rulings from other federal courts have determined that the other similarly unincorporated territories of American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands and the Virgin Islands, do not enjoy Eleventh Amendment immunity.\nTreaties and foreign relations.\nInternational law scholar Thomas H. Lee argues that foreign states were intended to be excluded from the Eleventh Amendment's prohibition\u2014i.e., that foreign governments would still be permitted to sue state governments. However, in \"Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi\", 292 U.S. https:// (1934), the Supreme Court ruled that the amendment also protects states from lawsuits by foreign entities, which Lee considers a departure from established jurisprudence; his thesis is that the Eleventh Amendment exempted foreign governments in order to allow recourse for violations of treaty obligations, which in turn promoted positive and peaceful foreign relations between a fledgling U.S. and the international community. Lee likewise argues that the Eleventh Amendment reflected the international legal principle of sovereign equality, whereby foreign states were of equal legal status to the U.S. states, and as such could bring lawsuits.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It replaced the procedure in , under which the Electoral College originally functioned. The amendment was proposed by Congress on December 9, 1803, and was ratified by the requisite three-quarters of state legislatures on June 15, 1804. The new rules took effect for the 1804 presidential election and have governed all subsequent presidential elections.\nInitially under the Constitution, each member of the Electoral College cast two electoral votes, with no distinction between electoral votes for president or for vice president. The presidential candidate receiving the greatest number of votes\u2014provided that number was at least a majority of the electors\u2014was elected president, while the presidential candidate receiving the second-most votes was elected vice president. In cases where no individual won the votes of a majority of the electors, as well as in cases where multiple persons won the votes of a majority but tied for the most votes, the House of Representatives would hold a contingent election to select the president. In cases where multiple candidates tied for the second-most votes, the Senate would hold a contingent election to select the vice president. The first four presidential elections were conducted under these rules.\nThe original system allowed the 1796 and 1800 presidential elections to elect a president and vice-president who were political opponents, constantly acting at cross-purposes. This was the case as John Adams (Federalist) had to deal with Thomas Jefferson (Democratic Republican) as his vice president. There was also the danger of two or more candidates tying in the electoral college. This was the case in 1800 when Jefferson and Aaron Burr, though both Anti-Federalist, were indeed tied in the college. This spurred legislators to amend the presidential election process to require each member of the Electoral College to cast one electoral vote for president and one electoral vote for vice president. Under the new rules, a contingent election is still held by the House of Representatives if no candidate wins the presidential electoral vote of a majority of the electors, but there is no longer any possibility of multiple candidates winning presidential electoral votes from a majority of electors, and it is provided that no individual constitutionally ineligible to the office of president would be eligible to serve as vice president.\nText.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Electors shall meet in their respective states, and vote by ballot for President and Vice-President, one of whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves; they shall name in their ballots the person voted for as President, and in distinct ballots the person voted for as Vice-President, and they shall make distinct lists of all persons voted for as President, and all persons voted for as Vice-President and of the number of votes for each, which lists they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate;\nThe President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted;\nThe person having the greatest number of votes for President, shall be the President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed; and if no person have such majority, then from the persons having the highest numbers not exceeding three on the list of those voted for as President, the House of Representatives shall choose immediately, by ballot, the President.

But no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBackground.\nUnder the original procedure for the Electoral College, as provided in , each elector cast two electoral votes, with no distinction made between electoral votes for president and electoral votes for vice president. The two people chosen by the elector could not both inhabit the same state as that elector. This prohibition was designed to keep electors from voting for two \"favorite sons\" of their respective states. The person receiving the greatest number of votes, provided that number constituted a majority of the electors, was elected president.\nThere were two possible scenarios in which the House of Representatives would need to hold a contingent election to select the president. If there were more than one individual who received the same number of votes, and such number equaled a majority of the electors, the House would choose one of them to be president. If no individual had a majority, then the House would choose from the five individuals with the greatest number of electoral votes. In both sets of circumstances, each state delegation had one (en bloc) vote. A candidate was required to receive an absolute majority, more than half of the total number of states, in order to be chosen as president.\nSelecting the vice president was a simpler process. Whichever candidate received the second greatest number of votes for president became vice president. The vice president, unlike the president, was not required to receive votes from a majority of the electors. In the event of a tie for second place, the Senate would hold a contingent election to select the vice president from those tied, with each senator casting one vote. A candidate was required to receive an absolute majority, more than half of the total Senate membership, in order to be chosen as vice president.\nThe original electoral system worked adequately for the first two presidential elections because on both occasions George Washington was the unanimous choice of the electors for president; the only real contest was the election for vice president for which an overall majority was not required. George Washington's decision not to seek a third term and the emergence of partisan political activity exposed problems with the original procedure.\nIn the 1796 election, John Adams, the Federalist Party presidential candidate, received votes from a majority of electors. However, the Federalist electors scattered their second votes, resulting in the Democratic\u2013Republican Party presidential candidate, Thomas Jefferson, receiving the second highest number of electoral votes and thus being elected vice president. It soon became apparent that having a vice president and a president unwilling to work together effectively was going to be a more significant problem than was originally realized. The most significant problem was that with the French Revolutionary Wars raging in Europe, it was immediately apparent that President Adams was going to pursue a pro-British foreign policy, much to the disgust of the strongly pro-French Vice President Jefferson.\nOn January 6, 1797, Federalist Representative William L. Smith of South Carolina responded to the 1796 result by presenting a resolution on the floor of the House of Representatives for an amendment to the Constitution requiring each elector to cast one vote for president and another for vice president. However, no action was taken on his proposal.\nThis set the stage for a crisis. In the 1800 election, both major parties attempted to prevent the problem that arose in 1796 by nominating separate presidential and vice presidential candidates on a party ticket. However, there was no way for the electors to distinguish between the two offices when they cast their votes, so if all the electors voted for their party tickets, the election would end in a tie between the two candidates from the most popular ticket.\nThe Democratic-Republicans, who had nominated Jefferson for president and Aaron Burr for vice president, managed to secure a majority of pledged electors. But the electoral margin was so slim that there was little room for error if the Democratic\u2013Republicans were to avoid repeating the Federalists' miscues of 1796. Given the technical limitations of 18th-century communications, Democratic\u2013Republican electors in each state were left to assume that an elector in some other state was the one responsible for casting the one abstention necessary to ensure the election of Burr to the vice presidency. In the event, all the Democratic\u2013Republicans electors were so reluctant to be responsible for causing outgoing President Adams to be elected as vice president that every Democratic\u2013Republican elector cast a vote for both Jefferson and Burr, resulting in a tie. This problem was termed later the Burr dilemma.\nConsequently, a contingent presidential election was held in the House of Representatives. Federalist-controlled state delegations cast their votes for Burr in an effort to prevent Jefferson from becoming president. Neither Burr nor Jefferson was able to win on the first 35 ballots. With help from Alexander Hamilton, the gridlock was finally broken on the 36th ballot and Jefferson was elected president on February 17, 1801. This prolonged contingent election, combined with the increasing Democratic\u2013Republican majorities in both the House and the Senate, set the stage for a constitutional amendment to alter this flawed system.\nAdoption.\nJourney to Congress.\nIn March 1801, weeks after the election of 1800 was resolved, two amendments were proposed in the New York State Legislature that would form the skeleton of the Twelfth Amendment. Governor John Jay submitted an amendment to the state legislature that would require a district election of electors in each state. Assemblyman Jedediah Peck submitted an amendment to adopt designations for the votes for president and vice president. The two amendments were not considered until early 1802 because the state legislature took a break for the summer and winter. New York state senator DeWitt Clinton moved for the adoption of the amendment in January 1802. Shortly thereafter, Clinton won a vacant seat in the U.S. Senate, where he was instrumental in bringing the designation amendment to Congress. The process continued in New York on February 15 when Representative Benjamin Walker of New York proposed the designation and district election amendments to the House. Debate on the amendments began in May. The Democratic-Republicans wanted to decide on the amendment quickly, but the Federalists argued that the ideas needed more time than the current session allowed. Federalist Samuel W. Dana of Connecticut wanted to examine the necessity of a vice president. The amendment ultimately failed in the New York State Senate, but DeWitt Clinton brought the amendment discussion to the House of Representatives.\nCongress was ready to debate the presented amendment, but the Democratic\u2013Republicans decided to wait for the 8th Congress. The 8th Congress would allow the Democratic\u2013Republicans a better chance of meeting the two-thirds vote requirement for submitting a proposed Constitutional amendment.\nCongressional debate.\nHouse of Representatives.\nIn 1803, on its first day, the 8th Congress considered the designation amendment. The first formulation of the amendment had the five highest electoral vote earners on the ballot in the House if no one candidate had a majority of the electoral votes. Democratic\u2013Republican John Clopton of Virginia, the largest state in the Union, argued that having five names on the list for a contingency election took the power from the people, so he proposed that there be only two names on the list. On October 20, the House appointed a seventeen-member committee (one Representative from each state) to fine-tune the amendment.\nThe original proposal starting in the New York State Legislature would have, along with designation, put forward the idea of the district election of electors that Treasury Secretary Gallatin had supported. Shortly after the committee was formed, Federalist Benjamin Huger attempted to add a provision regarding district elections to the proposed amendment, but the committee ignored him.\nThe committee then submitted an updated version of the designation amendment to the House on October 23 that changed the number of candidates in a contingency election from five to three and allowed the Senate to choose the vice president if there were a tie in that race. Small Federalist states disliked the change from five to three because it made it far less likely that a small-state candidate would make it to a contingency election. Huger and New York Federalist Gaylord Griswold argued that the Constitution was a compromise between large and small states and the method chosen by the Framers is supposed to check the influence of the larger states. Huger even asserted that the Constitution itself was not a union of people, but a union of large and small states in order to justify the original framework for electing the president. Designation, argued Griswold and Huger, would violate the spirit of the Constitution by taking away a check on the power of the large states.\nNext up for the Federalists was Seth Hastings of Massachusetts, who submitted the argument that the designation amendment rendered the vice presidency useless and advocated the elimination of the three-fifths clause. John C. Smith asked the inflammatory question of whether the proposed amendment was to help Jefferson get reelected. Speaker Nathaniel Macon called this inappropriate. Matthew Lyon of Kentucky denounced any reference to the three-fifths clause as mere provocation. The House proceeded to pass the resolution 88\u201331 on October 28, 1803.\nMany Northern representatives argued for the elimination of the electoral college, and argued for direct election of the President by all U.S. voters.\nSenate.\nBy October 28, the Senate had already been discussing the designation amendment. Democratic\u2013Republican DeWitt Clinton expected that the Senate, with a 24\u20139 Democratic\u2013Republican majority would quickly pass the amendment. Federalist Jonathan Dayton proposed that the office of the vice president should be eliminated and his colleague, Uriah Tracy, seconded it. On the other side, Wilson Cary Nicholas was simply worried that Congress would not submit the amendment in time for the states to ratify it before the 1804 election. Despite Nicholas' concern, the Senate would not seriously deal with the amendment again until November 23.\nMuch as it had in the House, debate centered on the number of candidates in a contingency election and the philosophical underpinnings of the Constitution. Again, small Federalist states vehemently argued that three candidates gave too much power to large states to pick presidents. Senator Pierce Butler of South Carolina argued that the issues with the election of 1800 were unlikely to happen again and he would not advocate changing the Constitution simply to stop a Federalist vice president. John Quincy Adams argued that the change from five to three gave an advantage to the people that violated the federative principle of the Constitution. Rather than have the office of the president balanced between the states and the people, Adams felt designation of president and vice president would tip that scale in favor of the people.\nFederalist senators argued for retaining the original procedure for the Electoral College. Senator Samuel White of Delaware claimed that the original procedure had not been given \"a fair experiment\" and criticized the proposed amendment for entrenching the two-party system which had taken over presidential elections.\nIn response, the Democratic\u2013Republicans appealed to democratic principles. Samuel Smith of Maryland argued that the presidency ought to be as closely accountable to the people as possible. As such, having three candidates in a contingency election is far better than having five, because it would otherwise be possible to have the fifth best candidate become president. Also, designation itself would drastically cut down the number of elections that would reach the House of Representatives, and the president is then much more likely to be the people's choice. Another of Smith's arguments was simply the election of 1800. William Cocke of Tennessee took a different approach when he argued that the entire small state argument of the Federalists was simply out of self-interest.\nOne last order of business for the amendment was to deal with the possibility that the House would fail to choose a president by March 4. It was the least controversial portion of the Twelfth Amendment and John Taylor proposed that the vice president would take over as president in that peculiar occurrence, \"as in case of the death or other Constitutional disability of the President\".\nIt seemed clear all along that the Democratic\u2013Republican dominance would render this a no-contest and the Democratic\u2013Republicans were just waiting for all their votes to be present, but the Federalists had one last defense. A marathon session of debate from 11:00a.m. to 10:00p.m. was the order of the day on December 2, 1803. Most notably, Uriah Tracy of Connecticut argued in a similar vein as Adams when he invoked the federative principle of the Constitution. Tracy claimed the original procedure was formulated to give the small states a chance to elect the vice president, who would be a check on the president's powers. In essence, the states balanced the power of the people. However, this works only if you make it partisan, as Georgia (for example) was a Democratic\u2013Republican small state.\nProposal and ratification.\nThe Twelfth Amendment was proposed by the 8th Congress on December 9, 1803, when it was approved by the House of Representatives by vote of 84\u201342, having been previously passed by the Senate, 22\u201310, on December 2. The amendment was officially submitted to the 17 states on December 12, 1803, and was ratified by the legislatures of the following states:\nThe amendment was rejected by Delaware, on January 18, 1804, and by Connecticut, on May 10, 1804. In a September 25, 1804, circular letter to the governors of the states, Secretary of State James Madison declared the amendment ratified by three-fourths of the states.\nElectoral College under the Twelfth Amendment.\nWhile the Twelfth Amendment did not change the composition of the Electoral College, it did change the process whereby a president and a vice president are elected. The new electoral process was first used for the 1804 election. Each presidential election since has been conducted under the terms of the Twelfth Amendment.\nThe Twelfth Amendment stipulates that each elector must cast distinct votes for president and vice president, instead of two votes for president. The amendment adapts the provision from the original Article II text that forbids an elector from casting both their presidential votes for inhabitants of their own state; under the Twelfth Amendment, one of the votes an elector casts\u2014either their vote for president or their vote for vice-president\u2014must be for someone who resides in a state other than the one where that elector lives. The upshot of this rule is that presidential candidates have refrained from selecting a running mate who lives in the same state that they do, lest they risk losing either the presidential or vice presidential votes from electors from their shared home state. For instance, at the beginning of 2000, Dick Cheney and George W. Bush were both legally residents of Texas; but, in preparation for being nominated as Bush's running mate, Cheney changed his legal residence to Wyoming, where he owned a home and which he had previously represented in Congress.\nIf no candidate for president has a majority of the total votes, the House of Representatives, voting by states and with the same quorum requirements as under the original procedure, chooses the president. This is the only proceeding in which the House votes by state delegation. The Twelfth Amendment requires the House to choose from the three highest receivers of electoral votes, compared to five under the original procedure.\nThe Twelfth Amendment requires a person to receive a majority of the electoral votes for vice president for that person to be elected vice president by the Electoral College. If no candidate for vice president has a majority of the total votes, the Senate, with each senator having one vote, chooses the vice president. The Twelfth Amendment requires the Senate to choose between the candidates with the \"two highest numbers\" of electoral votes. If multiple individuals are tied for second place, the Senate may consider them all. The Twelfth Amendment introduced a quorum requirement of two-thirds of the whole number of senators for the conduct of balloting. Furthermore, the Twelfth Amendment requires the Senate to choose a vice president by way of the affirmative votes of \"a majority of the whole number\" of senators.\nTo prevent deadlocks from keeping the nation leaderless, the Twelfth Amendment provided that if the House did not choose a president before March4 (then the first day of a presidential term), the individual elected vice president would \"act as President, as in the case of the death or other constitutional disability of the President\". The Twelfth Amendment did not state for how long the vice president would act as president or if the House could still choose a president after March 4. Section3 of the Twentieth Amendment, adopted in 1933, supersedes that provision of the Twelfth Amendment by changing the date upon which a new presidential term commences to January 20, clarifying that the vice president-elect would only \"act as President\" if the House has not chosen a president by January 20, and permitting Congress to statutorily provide \"who shall then act as President, or the manner in which one who is to act shall be selected\" if there is no president-elect or vice president-elect by January 20. It also clarifies that if there is no president-elect on January 20, whoever acts as president does so until a person \"qualified\" to occupy the presidency is elected to be president.\nInteraction with the Twenty-second Amendment.\nThe Twelfth Amendment explicitly states the also apply to being vice president and the Twenty-second Amendment bars a two-term president from being elected to a third term, but it is unexplicit whether these amendments together bar any two-term president from later serving as vice president as well as from succeeding to the presidency from any point in the United States presidential line of succession. Some contend that the Twelfth Amendment concerns qualification for \"service\", while the Twenty-second Amendment concerns qualifications for \"election\", and thus a former two-term president is still eligible to \"serve\" as vice president. Some legal scholars propose the contention above would inadequately consider the opportunity it affords for one to serve as president more than two terms plus \"[acting] as President, for more than two years,\" resulting in a violation of the Twenty-second Amendment.\nThe interaction between the two amendments has not been tested, as no twice-elected president has ever been nominated for the vice presidency. However, in striking down term limits imposed by state governments on members of Congress in \"U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton\" (1995), the Supreme Court held that term limits amount to a qualification for holding public office referencing the 22nd Amendment, stating that \"the Nation as a whole... has imposed a limit on the number of terms that the President may serve. Term limits, like any other qualification for office, unquestionably restrict the ability of voters to vote for whom they wish.\"\nHillary Clinton jokingly said during her 2016 presidential campaign that she had considered naming her husband, twice-elected former president Bill Clinton as her vice presidential running mate, but had been advised it would be unconstitutional. This constitutional ambiguity allowed for speculation in 2020 about whether twice-elected former president Barack Obama was eligible to be vice president.\nElections since 1804.\nStarting with the election of 1804, each presidential election has been conducted under the Twelfth Amendment. Only once since then has the House of Representatives chosen the president in a contingent election, in the 1824 election as none of the four candidates won an absolute majority (131 votes required at the time) of electoral votes: Andrew Jackson received 99 electoral votes, John Quincy Adams (son of John Adams) 84, William H. Crawford 41, and Henry Clay 37.\nAs the House could consider only the top three candidates, Clay was eliminated, while Crawford's poor health following a stroke and heart attack made his election by the House unlikely.\nJackson expected the House to vote for him, as he had won a plurality of both the popular and electoral votes. Instead, the House elected Adams on the first ballot with thirteen states, followed by Jackson with seven and Crawford with four. Clay had endorsed Adams for the presidency, which carried additional weight because Clay was the Speaker of the House. Adams subsequently appointed Clay as his Secretary of State, to which Jackson and his supporters responded by accusing the pair of making a \"corrupt bargain\". In the election for vice president, John C. Calhoun (the running mate of both Jackson and Adams) was elected outright, receiving 182 electoral votes.\nIn 1836, the Whig Party nominated four different candidates in different regions, aiming to splinter the electoral vote while denying Democratic nominee Martin Van Buren an electoral majority and forcing a contingent election. Ultimately Van Buren won the electoral college outright and the attempt to invoke the 12th Amendment proved fruitless.\nThe Whig strategy narrowly failed as Van Buren won an electoral vote majority and an apparent popular vote majority, winning Pennsylvania by 4,222 votes. In South Carolina, whose presidential electors were Whigs, no popular vote was held as the state legislature chose the electors.\nThe basis for the Whigs' strategy lay in a severe state-level Democratic Party split in Pennsylvania that propelled the Whig-aligned Anti-Masonic Party to statewide power. Party alignments by state in the House of Representatives suggest that any contingent election would have had an uncertain outcome, with none of the candidates (Van Buren, William Henry Harrison and Hugh White) having a clear path to victory.\nIn that same election, no candidate for vice president secured an electoral majority as the Democratic electors from Virginia refused to vote for Democratic vice presidential nominee, Richard Mentor Johnson, due to his relationship with a former slave, and instead cast their votes for William Smith.\nAs a result, Johnson received 147 electoral votes, one vote short of a majority, followed by Francis Granger with 77, John Tyler with 47 and Smith with 23. Thus, it became necessary for the Senate to hold a contingent election between Johnson and Granger for vice president, which Johnson won on the first ballot with 33 votes to Granger's 16.\nSince 1836, no major U.S. party has nominated multiple regional presidential or vice presidential candidates in an election. However, since the Civil War, there have been two serious attempts by Southern-based parties to run regional candidates in hopes of denying either of the two major party tickets an electoral college majority. Both attempts (in 1948 and 1968) narrowly failed; in both cases, a shift in the result of two or three close states would have forced these respective elections into the House (for president) and Senate (for vice president).\nIn modern elections, a running mate is often selected in order to appeal to a different set of voters. A Habitation Clause issue arose during the 2000 presidential election contested by George W. Bush (running-mate Dick Cheney, who Bush selected) and Al Gore (running-mate Joe Lieberman), because it was alleged that Bush and Cheney were both inhabitants of Texas and that the Texas electors therefore violated the Twelfth Amendment in casting their ballots for both. Texas' 32 electoral votes were necessary in order to secure Bush and Cheney a majority in the Electoral College. With the Democrats picking up four seats in the Senate to equal the Republicans at 50 seats each in the chamber, the outcome of a contingent election in the Senate, especially if it had happened after the newly elected senators had been seated, would have been far from certain; in fact such an election in 2000, had it happened, would have determined which party controlled the Senate.\nBush's residency was unquestioned, as he was Governor of Texas at the time. However, Cheney and his wife had moved to Dallas five years earlier when he assumed the role of chief executive at Halliburton. Cheney had grown up in Wyoming, had represented it in Congress and had continuously maintained a residence in the state during his tenure at Halliburton. A few months before the election, he switched his voter registration and driver's license to Wyoming and put his home in Dallas up for sale. On July 21, 2000, Cheney changed his voter registration from Texas to Teton County, Wyoming. Three Texas voters challenged the election in a federal court in Dallas and then appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, where it was dismissed.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The amendment was passed by the Senate on April 8, 1864, by the House of Representatives on January 31, 1865, and ratified by the required 27 of the then 36 states on December 6, 1865, and proclaimed on December 18, 1865. It was the first of the three Reconstruction Amendments adopted following the American Civil War.\nPresident Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, effective on January 1, 1863, declared that the enslaved in Confederate-controlled areas (and thus almost all slaves) were free. When they escaped to Union lines or federal forces (including now-former slaves) advanced south, emancipation occurred without any compensation to the former owners. Texas was the last Confederate slave state, where enforcement of the proclamation was declared on June 19, 1865. In the slave-owning areas controlled by Union forces on January 1, 1863, state action was used to abolish slavery. The exceptions were Kentucky and Delaware, where chattel slavery and indentured servitude were finally ended by the Thirteenth Amendment in December 1865.\nIn contrast to the other Reconstruction Amendments, the Thirteenth Amendment has rarely been cited in case law, but it has been used to strike down peonage and some race-based discrimination as \"badges and incidents of slavery\". The Thirteenth Amendment has also been invoked to empower Congress to make laws against modern forms of slavery, such as sex trafficking. It was the first amendment to directly govern private individuals instead of just the government.\nFrom its inception in 1776, the United States was divided into states that allowed slavery and states that prohibited it. Slavery was implicitly recognized in the original Constitution in provisions such as the Three-fifths Compromise (Article I, Section 2, Clause 3), which provided that three-fifths of each state's enslaved population (\"other persons\") was to be for the purposes of apportioning seats in the United States House of Representatives, its number of Electoral votes, and direct taxes among the states. The Fugitive Slave Clause (Article IV, Section 2, Clause 3) provided that slaves held under the laws of one state who escaped to another state did not become free, but remained slaves.\nThough three million Confederate slaves were eventually freed as a result of Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, their postwar status was uncertain. To ensure that abolition was beyond legal challenge, an amendment to the Constitution to that effect was drafted. On April 8, 1864, the Senate passed an amendment to abolish slavery. After one unsuccessful vote and extensive legislative maneuvering by the Lincoln administration, the House followed suit on January 31, 1865. The measure was swiftly ratified by nearly all Northern states, along with a sufficient number of border states up to the assassination of President Lincoln. However, the approval came via his successor, President Andrew Johnson, who encouraged the \"reconstructed\" Southern states of Alabama, North Carolina, and Georgia to agree, which brought the count to 27 states, leading to its adoption before the end of 1865.\nThough the Amendment abolished slavery throughout the United States, some black Americans, particularly in the South, were subjected to other forms of involuntary labor, such as under the Black Codes. They were also victims of white supremacist violence, selective enforcement of statutes, and other disabilities. Many such abuses were given cover by the Amendment's penal labor exception.\nText.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\nSection 2. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.\nSlavery in the United States.\nSlavery existed and was legal in the United States of America upon its founding in 1776. It was established by European colonization in all of the original thirteen American colonies of British America. Prior to the Thirteenth Amendment, the United States Constitution did not expressly use the words \"slave\" or \"slavery\" but included several provisions about unfree persons. The Three-Fifths Compromise, Article I, Section 2, Clause3 of the Constitution, allocated Congressional representation based \"on the whole Number of free Persons\" and \"three-fifths of all other Persons\". This clause was a compromise between Southern politicians who wished for enslaved African-Americans to be counted as 'persons' for congressional representation and Northern politicians rejecting these out of concern of too much power for the South, because representation in the new Congress would be based on population in contrast to the one-vote-for-one-state principle in the earlier Continental Congress. Under the Fugitive Slave Clause, Article IV, Section 2, Clause 3, \"No person held to Service or Labour in one State\" would be freed by escaping to another. allowed Congress to pass legislation outlawing the \"Importation of Persons\", which would not be passed until 1808. However, for purposes of the Fifth Amendment\u2014which states that \"No person shall... be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law\"\u2014slaves were understood as property. Although abolitionists used the Fifth Amendment to argue against slavery, it became part of the legal basis in \"Dred Scott v. Sandford\" (1857) for treating slaves as property.\nStimulated by the philosophy of the Declaration of Independence, between 1777 and 1804 every Northern state provided for the immediate or gradual abolition of slavery. (Slavery was never legal in Vermont; it was prohibited in the 1777 constitution creating Vermont, to become the fourteenth state.) Most of the slaves who were emancipated by such legislation were household servants. No Southern state did so, and the enslaved population of the South continued to grow, peaking at almost four million in 1861. An abolitionist movement, headed by such figures as William Lloyd Garrison, Theodore Dwight Weld, and Angelina Grimk\u00e9, grew in strength in the North, calling for the immediate end of slavery nationwide and exacerbating tensions between North and South. The American Colonization Society, an alliance between abolitionists who felt the \"races\" should be kept separated and slaveholders who feared the presence of freed blacks would encourage slave rebellions, called for the emigration of both free blacks and slaves to Africa, where they would establish independent colonies. Its views were endorsed by politicians such as Henry Clay, who feared that the American abolitionist movement would provoke a civil war. Proposals to eliminate slavery by constitutional amendment were introduced by Representative Arthur Livermore in 1818 and by John Quincy Adams in 1839, but failed to gain significant traction.\nAs the country continued to expand, the issue of slavery in its new territories became the dominant national issue. The senatorial votes of new states could break the deadlock in the Senate over slavery. The Southern position was that slaves were property and therefore could be moved to the territories like all other forms of property. The 1820 Missouri Compromise provided for the admission of Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state, preserving the Senate's equality between the regions. In 1846, the Wilmot Proviso was introduced to a war appropriations bill to ban slavery in all territories acquired in the Mexican\u2013American War; the Proviso repeatedly passed the House, but not the Senate. The Compromise of 1850 temporarily defused the issue by admitting California as a free state, instituting a stronger Fugitive Slave Act, banning the slave trade in Washington, D.C., and allowing New Mexico and Utah self-determination on the slavery issue.\nDespite the compromise, tensions between North and South continued to rise over the subsequent decade, inflamed by, among other things, the publication of the 1852 anti-slavery novel \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\"; fighting between pro-slavery and abolitionist forces in Kansas, beginning in 1854; the 1857 \"Dred Scott\" decision, which struck down the Missouri Compromise and provisions of the Compromise of 1850; abolitionist John Brown's 1859 attempt to start a slave revolt at Harpers Ferry; and the 1860 election of Abraham Lincoln, who opposed allowing slavery to expand into the Western territories, to the presidency. The Southern states seceded from the Union in the months following Lincoln's election, forming the Confederate States of America, and beginning the American Civil War.\nProposal and ratification.\nCrafting the amendment.\nActing under presidential war powers, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation on September 22, 1862, with effect on January 1, 1863, which proclaimed the freedom of slaves in the ten states that were still in rebellion. In his State of the Union message to Congress on December 1, 1862, Lincoln also presented a plan for \"gradual emancipation and deportation\" of slaves. This plan envisioned three amendments to the Constitution. The first would have required the states to abolish slavery by January 1, 1900. Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation then proceeded immediately freeing slaves in January 1863 but did not affect the status of slaves in the border states that had remained loyal to the Union. By December 1863, Lincoln again used his war powers and issued a \"Proclamation for Amnesty and Reconstruction\", which offered Southern states a chance to peacefully rejoin the Union if they immediately abolished slavery and collected loyalty oaths from 10% of their voting population. Southern states did not readily accept the deal, and the status of slavery remained uncertain.\nIn the final years of the Civil War, Union lawmakers debated various proposals for Reconstruction. Some of these called for a constitutional amendment to abolish slavery nationally and permanently. On December 14, 1863, a bill proposing such an amendment was introduced by Representative James Mitchell Ashley of Ohio. Representative James F. Wilson of Iowa soon followed with a similar proposal. On January 11, 1864, Senator John B. Henderson of Missouri submitted a joint resolution for a constitutional amendment abolishing slavery. The Senate Judiciary Committee, chaired by Lyman Trumbull of Illinois, became involved in merging different proposals for an amendment.\nRadical Republicans led by Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner and Pennsylvania Representative Thaddeus Stevens sought a more expansive version of the amendment. On February 8, 1864, Sumner submitted a constitutional amendment stating:\nAll persons are equal before the law, so that no person can hold another as a slave; and the Congress shall have power to make all laws necessary and proper to carry this declaration into effect everywhere in the United States.\nSumner tried to have his amendment sent to his committee, rather than the Judiciary Committee, controlled by Trumbull, but the Senate refused. On February 10, the Senate Judiciary Committee presented the Senate with an amendment proposal based on drafts of Ashley, Wilson and Henderson.\nThe committee's version used text from the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, which stipulates, \"There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said territory, otherwise than in the punishment of crimes whereof the party shall have been duly convicted.\" Though using Henderson's proposed amendment as the basis for its new draft, the Judiciary Committee removed language that would have allowed a constitutional amendment to be adopted with only a majority vote in each House of Congress and ratification by two-thirds of the states (instead of two-thirds and three-fourths, respectively).\nPassage by Congress.\nThe Senate passed the amendment on April 8, 1864, by a vote of 38 to 6; two Democrats, Oregon Senators Benjamin F. Harding and James Nesmith voted for the amendment. However, just over two months later on June 15, the House failed to do so, with 93 in favor and 65 against, thirteen votes short of the two-thirds vote needed for passage; the vote split largely along party lines, with Republicans supporting and Democrats opposing. In the 1864 presidential race, former Free Soil Party candidate John C. Fr\u00e9mont threatened a third-party run opposing Lincoln, this time on a platform endorsing an anti-slavery amendment. The Republican Party platform had, as yet, failed to include a similar plank, though Lincoln endorsed the amendment in a letter accepting his nomination. Fr\u00e9mont withdrew from the race on September 22, 1864, and endorsed Lincoln.\nWith no Southern states represented, few members of Congress pushed moral and religious arguments in favor of slavery. Democrats who opposed the amendment generally made arguments based on federalism and states' rights. Some argued that the proposed change so violated the spirit of the Constitution it would not be a valid \"amendment\" but would instead constitute \"revolution\". Representative Chilton A. White, among other opponents, warned that the amendment would lead to full citizenship for blacks.\nRepublicans portrayed slavery as uncivilized and argued for abolition as a necessary step in national progress. Amendment supporters also argued that the slave system had negative effects on white people. These included the lower wages resulting from competition with forced labor, as well as repression of abolitionist whites in the South. Advocates said ending slavery would restore the First Amendment and other constitutional rights violated by censorship and intimidation in slave states.\nWhite, Northern Republicans and some Democrats became excited about an abolition amendment, holding meetings and issuing resolutions. Many blacks though, particularly in the South, focused more on land ownership and education as the key to liberation. As slavery began to seem politically untenable, an array of Northern Democrats successively announced their support for the amendment, including Representative James Brooks, Senator Reverdy Johnson, and the powerful New York political machine known as Tammany Hall.\nPresident Lincoln had had concerns that the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 might be reversed or found invalid by the judiciary after the war. He saw constitutional amendment as a more permanent solution. He had remained outwardly neutral on the amendment because he considered it politically too dangerous. Nonetheless, Lincoln's 1864 election platform resolved to abolish slavery by constitutional amendment. After winning reelection in the election of 1864, Lincoln made the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment his top legislative priority. He began with his efforts in Congress during its \"lame duck\" session, in which many members of Congress had already seen their successors elected; most would be concerned about unemployment and lack of income, and none needed to fear the electoral consequences of cooperation. Popular support for the amendment mounted and Lincoln urged Congress on in his December 6, 1864 State of the Union Address: \"there is only a question of \"time\" as to when the proposed amendment will go to the States for their action. And as it is to so go, at all events, may we not agree that the sooner the better?\"\nLincoln instructed Secretary of State William H. Seward, Representative John B. Alley and others to procure votes by any means necessary, and they promised government posts and campaign contributions to outgoing Democrats willing to switch sides. Seward had a large fund for direct bribes. Ashley, who reintroduced the measure into the House, also lobbied several Democrats to vote in favor of the measure. Representative Thaddeus Stevens later commented that \"the greatest measure of the nineteenth century was passed by corruption aided and abetted by the purest man in America\"; however, Lincoln's precise role in making deals for votes remains unknown.\nRepublicans in Congress claimed a mandate for abolition, having gained in the elections for Senate and House. The 1864 Democratic vice-presidential nominee, Representative George H. Pendleton, led opposition to the measure. Republicans toned down their language of radical equality in order to broaden the amendment's coalition of supporters. In order to reassure critics worried that the amendment would tear apart the social fabric, some Republicans explicitly promised the amendment would leave broader American society's patriarchal traditions intact.\nIn mid-January 1865, Speaker of the House Schuyler Colfax estimated the amendment to be five votes short of passage. Ashley postponed the vote. At this point, Lincoln intensified his push for the amendment, making direct emotional appeals to particular members of Congress. On January 31, 1865, the House called another vote on the amendment, with neither side being certain of the outcome. With a total of 183 House members (one seat was vacant after Reuben Fenton was elected governor), 122 would have to vote \"aye\" to secure passage of the resolution; however, eight Democrats abstained, reducing the number to 117. Every Republican (84), Independent Republican (2), and Unconditional Unionist (16) supported the measure, as well as fourteen Democrats, almost all of them lame ducks, and three Unionists. The amendment finally passed by a vote of 119 to 56, narrowly reaching the required two-thirds majority. The House exploded into celebration, with some members openly weeping. Black onlookers, who had only been allowed to attend Congressional sessions since the previous year, cheered from the galleries.\nWhile the Constitution does not provide the President any formal role in the amendment process, the joint resolution was sent to Lincoln for his signature. Under the usual signatures of the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate, President Lincoln wrote the word \"Approved\" and added his signature to the joint resolution on February 1, 1865. On February 7, Congress passed a resolution affirming that the Presidential signature was unnecessary. The Thirteenth Amendment was the first of two ratified amendments to be signed by a President, the second being the Twenty-Sixth Amendment, the certification of which was signed by Richard Nixon on the 5th of July 1971 and with three 18-year-olds signing on as his witnesses, although James Buchanan had signed the Corwin Amendment that the 36th Congress had adopted and sent to the states in March 1861.\nRatification by the states.\nOn February 1, 1865, when the proposed amendment was submitted to the states for ratification, there were 36 states in the U.S., including those that had been in rebellion; at least 27 states had to ratify the amendment for it to come into force. By the end of February, 18 states had ratified the amendment. Among them were the states of Virginia and Louisiana, states with large territories then held separately by the Union and the Confederacy. In these cases, it was the Union recognized legislatures, operating out of Alexandria, Virginia and New Orleans respectively, that ratified the amendment. These, along with subsequent ratifications from Arkansas and Tennessee raised the issues of how many seceded states had legally valid legislatures; and if there were fewer legislatures than states, if Article V required ratification by three-fourths of the states or three-fourths of the legally valid state legislatures. President Lincoln in his last speech, on April 11, 1865, called the question about whether the Southern states were in or out of the Union a \"pernicious abstraction\". He declared they were not \"in their proper practical relation with the Union\"; whence everyone's object should be to restore that relation. Lincoln was assassinated three days later.\nWith Congress out of session, the new president, Andrew Johnson, began a period known as \"Presidential Reconstruction\", in which he personally oversaw the creation of new state governments throughout the South. He oversaw the convening of state political conventions populated by delegates whom he deemed to be loyal. Three leading issues came before the conventions: secession itself, the abolition of slavery, and the Confederate war debt. Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina held conventions in 1865, while Texas' convention did not organize until March 1866. Johnson hoped to prevent deliberation over whether to re-admit the Southern states by accomplishing full ratification before Congress reconvened in December. He believed he could silence those who wished to deny the Southern states their place in the Union by pointing to how essential their assent had been to the successful ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment.\nDirect negotiations between state governments and the Johnson administration ensued. As the summer wore on, administration officials began giving assurances of the measure's limited scope with their demands for ratification. Johnson himself suggested directly to the governors of Mississippi and North Carolina that they could proactively control the allocation of rights to freedmen. Though Johnson obviously expected the freed people to enjoy at least some civil rights, including, as he specified, the right to testify in court, he wanted state lawmakers to know that the power to confer such rights would remain with the states. When South Carolina provisional governor Benjamin Franklin Perry objected to the scope of the amendment's enforcement clause, Secretary of State Seward responded by telegraph that in fact the second clause \"is really restraining in its effect, instead of enlarging the powers of Congress\". Politicians throughout the South were concerned that Congress might cite the amendment's enforcement powers as a way to authorize black suffrage.\nWhen South Carolina ratified the Amendment in November 1865, it issued its own interpretive declaration that \"any attempt by Congress toward legislating upon the political status of former slaves, or their civil relations, would be contrary to the Constitution of the United States.\" Alabama and Louisiana also declared that their ratification did not imply federal power to legislate on the status of former slaves. During the first week of December, North Carolina and Georgia gave the amendment the final votes needed for it to become part of the Constitution.\nThe first 27 states to ratify the Amendment were:\nHaving been ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the states (27 of the 36 states, including those that had been in rebellion), Secretary of State Seward, on December 18, 1865, certified that the Thirteenth Amendment had become valid, to all intents and purposes, as a part of the Constitution. Included on the enrolled list of ratifying states were the three ex-Confederate states that had given their assent, but with strings attached. Seward accepted their affirmative votes and brushed aside their interpretive declarations without comment, challenge or acknowledgment.\nThe Thirteenth Amendment was subsequently ratified by the other states, as follows:\nWith the ratification by Mississippi in 1995, and certification thereof in 2013, the amendment was finally ratified by all states having existed at the time of its adoption in 1865.\nEffects.\nFreeing slaves.\nThe immediate impact of the amendment was to make the entire pre-war system of chattel slavery in the U.S. illegal. The impact of the abolition of slavery was felt quickly. When the Thirteenth Amendment became operational, the scope of Lincoln's 1863 Emancipation Proclamation was widened to include the entire nation. Although the majority of Kentucky's slaves had been emancipated, 65,000\u2013100,000 people remained to be legally freed when the amendment went into effect on December 18. In Delaware, where a large number of slaves had escaped during the war, nine hundred people became legally free. With slavery abolished, the Fugitive Slave Clause remained in place but became largely moot.\nNative American territory.\nDespite being rendered unconstitutional, slavery continued in areas under the jurisdiction of Native American tribes beyond ratification. The federal government negotiated new treaties with the \"Five Civilized Tribes\" in 1866, in which they agreed to end slavery.\nElectoral changes.\nThe Three-Fifths Compromise in the original Constitution counted, for purposes of allocating taxes and seats in the House of Representatives, all \"free persons\", three-fifths of \"other persons\" (i.e., slaves) and excluded untaxed Native Americans. The freeing of all slaves made the three-fifths clause moot. Compared to the pre-war system, it also had the effect of increasing the political power of former slave-holding states by increasing their share of seats in the House of Representatives, and consequently their share in the Electoral College (where the number of a state's electoral votes, under Article II of the United States Constitution, is tied to the size of its congressional delegation).\nEven as the Thirteenth Amendment was working its way through the ratification process, Republicans in Congress grew increasingly concerned about the potential for there to be a large increase in the congressional representation of the Democratic-dominated Southern states. Because the full population of freed slaves would be counted rather than three-fifths, the Southern states would dramatically increase their power in the population-based House of Representatives. Republicans hoped to offset this advantage by attracting and protecting votes of the newly enfranchised black population. They would eventually attempt to address this issue in section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nPolitical and economic change in the South.\nSouthern culture remained deeply racist, and those blacks who remained faced a dangerous situation. J. J. Gries reported to the Joint Committee on Reconstruction: \"There is a kind of innate feeling, a lingering hope among many in the South that slavery will be regalvanized in some shape or other. They tried by their laws to make a worse slavery than there was before, for the freedman has not the protection which the master from interest gave him before.\" W. E. B. Du Bois wrote in 1935:\nSlavery was not abolished even after the Thirteenth Amendment. There were four million freedmen and most of them on the same plantation, doing the same work they did before emancipation, except as their work had been interrupted and changed by the upheaval of war. Moreover, they were getting about the same wages and apparently were going to be subject to slave codes modified only in name. There were among them thousands of fugitives in the camps of the soldiers or on the streets of the cities, homeless, sick, and impoverished. They had been freed practically with no land nor money, and, save in exceptional cases, without legal status, and without protection.\nOfficial emancipation did not substantially alter the economic situation of most blacks who remained in the south.\nAs the amendment still permitted labor as punishment for convicted criminals, Southern states responded with what historian Douglas A. Blackmon called \"an array of interlocking laws essentially intended to criminalize black life\". These laws, passed or updated after emancipation, were known as Black Codes. Mississippi was the first state to pass such codes, with an 1865 law titled \"An Act to confer Civil Rights on Freedmen\". The Mississippi law required black workers to contract with white farmers by January1 of each year or face punishment for vagrancy. Blacks could be sentenced to forced labor for crimes including petty theft, using obscene language, or selling cotton after sunset. States passed new, strict vagrancy laws that were selectively enforced against blacks without white protectors. The labor of these convicts was then sold to farms, factories, lumber camps, quarries, and mines.\nAfter its ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment in November 1865, the South Carolina legislature immediately began to legislate Black Codes. The Black Codes created a separate set of laws, punishments, and acceptable behaviors for anyone with more than one black great-grandparent. Under these Codes, Blacks could only work as farmers or servants and had few Constitutional rights. Restrictions on black land ownership threatened to make economic subservience permanent.\nSome states mandated indefinitely long periods of child \"apprenticeship\". Some laws did not target blacks specifically, but instead affected farm workers, most of whom were black. At the same time, many states passed laws to actively prevent blacks from acquiring property.\nCongressional and executive enforcement.\nAs its first enforcement legislation, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866, guaranteeing black Americans citizenship and equal protection of the law, though not the right to vote. The amendment was also used as authorizing several Freedmen's Bureau bills. President Andrew Johnson vetoed these bills, but Congress overrode his vetoes to pass the Civil Rights Act and the Second Freedmen's Bureau Bill.\nProponents of the Act, including Trumbull and Wilson, argued that Section2 of the Thirteenth Amendment authorized the federal government to legislate civil rights for the States. Others disagreed, maintaining that inequality conditions were distinct from slavery. Seeking more substantial justification, and fearing that future opponents would again seek to overturn the legislation, Congress and the states added additional protections to the Constitution: the Fourteenth Amendment (1868) defining citizenship and mandating equal protection under the law, and the Fifteenth Amendment (1870) banning racial voting restrictions.\nThe Freedmen's Bureau enforced the amendment locally, providing a degree of support for people subject to the Black Codes. Reciprocally, the Thirteenth Amendment established the Bureau's legal basis to operate in Kentucky. The Civil Rights Act circumvented racism in local jurisdictions by allowing blacks access to the federal courts. The Enforcement Acts of 1870\u20131871 and the Civil Rights Act of 1875, in combating the violence and intimidation of white supremacy, were also part of the effort to end slave conditions for Southern blacks. However, the effect of these laws waned as political will diminished and the federal government lost authority in the South, particularly after the Compromise of 1877 ended Reconstruction in exchange for a Republican presidency.\nPeonage law.\nSouthern business owners sought to reproduce the profitable arrangement of slavery with a system called peonage, in which disproportionately black workers were entrapped by loans and compelled to work indefinitely due to the resulting debt. Peonage continued well through Reconstruction and ensnared a large proportion of black workers in the South. These workers remained destitute and persecuted, forced to work dangerous jobs and further confined legally by the racist Jim Crow laws that governed the South. Peonage differed from chattel slavery because it was not strictly hereditary and did not allow the sale of people in exactly the same fashion. However, a person's debt\u2014and by extension a person\u2014could still be sold, and the system resembled antebellum slavery in many ways.\nSlavery in New Mexico also continued \"de facto\" in the form of peonage, which became a Spanish colonial tradition to work around the prohibition of hereditary slavery by the New Laws of 1542. Though this practice was rendered unconstitutional by the Thirteenth Amendment, enforcement was lax. The Peonage Act of 1867 specifically mentioned New Mexico and increased enforcement by banning nationwide \"the holding of any person to service or labor under the system known as peonage\", specifically banning \"the voluntary or involuntary service or labor of any persons as peons, in liquidation of any debt or obligation, or otherwise.\"\nIn 1939, the United States Department of Justice created the Civil Rights Section, which focused primarily on First Amendment and labor rights. The increasing scrutiny of totalitarianism in the lead-up to World War II brought increased attention to issues of slavery and involuntary servitude, abroad and at home. The U.S. sought to counter foreign propaganda and increase its credibility on the race issue by combatting the Southern peonage system. Under the leadership of Attorney General Francis Biddle, the Civil Rights Section invoked the constitutional amendments and legislation of the Reconstruction Era as the basis for its actions.\nIn 1947, the DOJ successfully prosecuted Elizabeth Ingalls for keeping domestic servant Dora L. Jones in conditions of slavery. The court found that Jones \"was a person wholly subject to the will of defendant; that she was one who had no freedom of action and whose person and services were wholly under the control of defendant and who was in a state of enforced compulsory service to the defendant.\" The Thirteenth Amendment enjoyed a swell of attention during this period, but from \"Brown v. Board of Education\" (1954) until \"Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.\" (1968) it was again eclipsed by the Fourteenth Amendment.\nPenal labor exemption.\nThe Thirteenth Amendment exempts penal labor from its prohibition of forced labor. This allows prisoners who have been convicted of crimes (not those merely awaiting trial) to be required to perform labor or else face punishment while in custody.\nFew records of the committee's deliberations during the drafting of the Thirteenth Amendment survive, and the debate that followed both in Congress and in the state legislatures featured almost no discussion of this provision. It was apparently considered noncontroversial at the time, or at least legislators gave it little thought. The drafters based the amendment's phrasing on the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, which features an identical exception. Thomas Jefferson authored an early version of that ordinance's anti-slavery clause, including the exception of punishment for a crime, and also sought to prohibit slavery in general after 1800. Jefferson was an admirer of the works of Italian criminologist Cesare Beccaria. Beccaria's \"On Crimes and Punishments\" suggested that the death penalty should be abolished and replaced with a lifetime of enslavement for the worst criminals; Jefferson likely included the clause due to his agreement with Beccaria. Beccaria, while attempting to reduce \"legal barbarism\" of the 1700s, considered forced labor one of the few harsh punishments acceptable; for example, he advocated slave labor as a just punishment for robbery, so that the thief's labor could be used to pay recompense to their victims and to society. Penal \"hard labor\" has ancient origins, and was adopted early in American history (as in Europe) often as a substitute for capital or corporal punishment.\nVarious commentators have accused states of abusing this provision to re-establish systems similar to slavery, or of otherwise exploiting such labor in a manner unfair to local labor. The Black Codes in the South criminalized \"vagrancy\", which was largely enforced against freed slaves. Later, convict lease programs in the South allowed local plantations to rent inexpensive prisoner labor. While many of these programs have been phased out (leasing of convicts was forbidden by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1941), prison labor continues in the U.S. under a variety of justifications. Prison labor programs vary widely; some are uncompensated prison maintenance tasks, some are for local government maintenance tasks, some are for local businesses, and others are closer to internships. Modern rationales for prison labor programs often include reduction of recidivism and re-acclimation to society; the idea is that such labor programs will make it easier for the prisoner upon release to find gainful employment rather than relapse to criminality. However, this topic is not well-studied, and much of the work offered is so menial as to be unlikely to improve employment prospects. As of 2017, most prison labor programs do compensate prisoners, but generally with very low wages. What wages they do earn are often heavily garnished, with as much as 80% of a prisoner's paycheck withheld in the harshest cases.\nIn 2018, artist and entertainer Kanye West advocated for repealing the Thirteenth Amendment's exception for penal labor in a meeting with President Donald Trump, calling the exception a \"trap door\". In late 2020, Senator Jeff Merkley (D-OR) and Representative William Lacy Clay (D-MO) introduced a resolution to create a new amendment to close this loophole.\nJudicial interpretation.\nIn contrast to the other \"Reconstruction Amendments\", the Thirteenth Amendment was rarely cited in later case law. As historian Amy Dru Stanley summarizes, \"beyond a handful of landmark rulings striking down debt peonage, flagrant involuntary servitude, and some instances of race-based violence and discrimination, the Thirteenth Amendment has never been a potent source of rights claims.\"\nBlack slaves and their descendants.\nSupreme Court justices Noah Haynes Swayne and Salmon P. Chase provided the first applications of the Thirteenth Amendment while riding circuit. In \"United States v. Rhodes\" (1866), Swayne moved a Kentucky robbery case to federal court because of a state law prohibiting black witnesses from testifying against white defendants. While Swayne viewed the judicial discrimination as unconstitutionally reinforcing the stigma of being a former slave, the Supreme Court reached the opposite conclusion in the 7\u20132 decision of \"Blyew v. United States\" (1872). \"In re Turner\" (1867), Chase voided a Maryland law allowing state courts to apprentice black children with fewer rights than those of white children.\nIn \"United States v. Cruikshank\" (1876), the Court ignored Thirteenth Amendment dicta from a circuit court decision to exonerate perpetrators of the Colfax massacre and invalidate the Enforcement Act of 1870. The Thirteenth Amendment is not solely a ban on chattel slavery; it also covers a much broader array of labor arrangements and social deprivations. As the U.S. Supreme Court explicated in the \"Slaughter-House Cases\" (1873) with respect to the Reconstruction Amendments:\nUndoubtedly while negro slavery alone was in the mind of the Congress which proposed the thirteenth article, it forbids any other kind of slavery, now or hereafter. If Mexican peonage or the Chinese coolie labor system shall develop slavery of the Mexican or Chinese race within our territory, this amendment may safely be trusted to make it void. And so if other rights are assailed by the States which properly and necessarily fall within the protection of these articles, that protection will apply, though the party interested may not be of African descent. But what we do say, and what we wish to be understood is, that in any fair and just construction of any section or phrase of these amendments, it is necessary to look to the purpose which we have said was the pervading spirit of them all, the evil which they were designed to remedy, and the process of continued addition to the Constitution, until that purpose was supposed to be accomplished, as far as constitutional law can accomplish it.\nIn the \"Civil Rights Cases\" (1883), the Supreme Court reviewed five consolidated cases dealing with the Civil Rights Act of 1875, which outlawed racial discrimination at \"inns, public conveyances on land or water, theaters, and other places of public amusement\". The Court ruled that the Thirteenth Amendment did not ban most forms of racial discrimination by non-government actors. In the majority decision, Bradley wrote (again in non-binding dicta) that the Thirteenth Amendment empowered Congress to attack \"badges and incidents of slavery\". However, he distinguished between \"fundamental rights\" of citizenship, protected by the Thirteenth Amendment, and the \"social rights of men and races in the community\". The majority opinion held that \"it would be running the slavery argument into the ground to make it apply to every act of discrimination which a person may see fit to make as to guests he will entertain, or as to the people he will take into his coach or cab or car; or admit to his concert or theatre, or deal with in other matters of intercourse or business.\" In his solitary dissent, John Marshall Harlan (a Kentucky lawyer who changed his mind about civil rights law after witnessing organized racist violence) argued that \"such discrimination practiced by corporations and individuals in the exercise of their public or quasi-public functions is a badge of servitude, the imposition of which congress may prevent under its power.\"\nThe Court in the \"Civil Rights Cases\" also held that appropriate legislation under the amendment could go beyond nullifying state laws establishing or upholding slavery, because the amendment \"has a reflex character also, establishing and decreeing universal civil and political freedom throughout the United States\" and thus Congress was empowered \"to pass all laws necessary and proper for abolishing all badges and incidents of slavery in the United States.\" The Court stated about the amendment's scope:\nThis amendment, as well as the Fourteenth, is undoubtedly self-executing, without any ancillary legislation, so far as its terms are applicable to any existing state of circumstances. By its own unaided force and effect, it abolished slavery and established universal freedom. Still, legislation may be necessary and proper to meet all the various cases and circumstances to be affected by it, and to prescribe proper modes of redress for its violation in letter or spirit. And such legislation may be primary and direct in its character, for the amendment is not a mere prohibition of State laws establishing or upholding slavery, but an absolute declaration that slavery or involuntary servitude shall not exist in any part of the United States.\nAttorneys in \"Plessy v. Ferguson\" (1896) argued that racial segregation involved \"observances of a servile character coincident with the incidents of slavery\", in violation of the Thirteenth Amendment. In their brief to the Supreme Court, Plessy's lawyers wrote that \"distinction of race and caste\" was inherently unconstitutional. The Supreme Court rejected this reasoning and upheld state laws enforcing segregation under the \"separate but equal\" doctrine. In the (7\u20131) majority decision, the Court found that \"a statute which implies merely a legal distinction between the white and colored races\u2014a distinction which is founded on the color of the two races and which must always exist so long as white men are distinguished from the other race by color\u2014has no tendency to destroy the legal equality of the two races, or reestablish a state of involuntary servitude.\" Harlan dissented, writing: \"The thin disguise of 'equal' accommodations for passengers in railroad coaches will not mislead anyone, nor, atone for the wrong this day done.\"\nIn \"Robertson v. Baldwin\", 165 U.S. https:// (1897) the Court laid out the scope and exceptions of the Thirteenth Amendment: The prohibition of slavery in the Thirteenth Amendment is well known to have been adopted with reference to a state of affairs which had existed in certain states of the Union since the foundation of the government, while the addition of the words \"involuntary servitude\" were said, in the \"Slaughter-House Cases\", 16 Wall. 36, to have been intended to cover the system of Mexican peonage and the Chinese coolie trade, the practical operation of which might have been a revival of the institution of slavery under a different and less offensive name. It is clear, however, that the amendment was not intended to introduce any novel doctrine with respect to certain descriptions of service which have always been treated as exceptional, such as military and naval enlistments, or to disturb the right of parents and guardians to the custody of their minor children or wards. The amendment, however, makes no distinction between a public and a private service. To say that persons engaged in a public service are not within the amendment is to admit that there are exceptions to its general language, and the further question is at once presented, where shall the line be drawn? We know of no better answer to make than to say that services which have from time immemorial been treated as exceptional shall not be regarded as within its purview.\nIn \"Hodges v. United States\" (1906), the Court struck down a federal statute providing for the punishment of two or more people who \"conspire to injure, oppress, threaten or intimidate any citizen in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States\". A group of white men in Arkansas conspired to violently prevent eight black workers from performing their jobs at a lumber mill; the group was convicted by a federal grand jury. The Supreme Court ruled that the federal statute, which outlawed conspiracies to deprive citizens of their liberty, was not authorized by the Thirteenth Amendment. It held that \"no mere personal assault or trespass or appropriation operates to reduce the individual to a condition of slavery.\" Harlan dissented, maintaining his opinion that the Thirteenth Amendment should protect freedom beyond \"physical restraint\". \"Corrigan v. Buckley\" (1922) reaffirmed the interpretation from \"Hodges\", finding that the amendment does not apply to restrictive covenants.\nEnforcement of federal civil rights law in the South created numerous peonage cases, which slowly traveled up through the judiciary. The Supreme Court ruled in \"Clyatt v. United States\" (1905) that peonage was involuntary servitude. It held that although employers sometimes described their workers' entry into contract as voluntary, the servitude of peonage was always (by definition) involuntary.\nIn \"Bailey v. Alabama\" the U.S. Supreme Court reaffirmed its holding that the Thirteenth Amendment is not solely a ban on chattel slavery, it also covers a much broader array of labor arrangements and social deprivations. In addition to the aforesaid the Court also ruled on Congress enforcement power under the Thirteenth Amendment. The Court said:\nThe plain intention [of the amendment] was to abolish slavery of whatever name and form and all its badges and incidents; to render impossible any state of bondage; to make labor free, by prohibiting that control by which the personal service of one man is disposed of or coerced for another's benefit, which is the essence of involuntary servitude. While the Amendment was self-executing, so far as its terms were applicable to any existing condition, Congress was authorized to secure its complete enforcement by appropriate legislation.\n\"Jones\" and beyond.\nLegal histories cite \"Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.\" (1968) as a turning point of Thirteen Amendment jurisprudence. The Supreme Court confirmed in \"Jones\" that Congress may act \"rationally\" to prevent private actors from imposing \"badges and incidents of servitude\". The Joneses were a black couple in St. Louis County, Missouri, who sued a real estate company for refusing to sell them a house. The Court held:\nCongress has the power under the Thirteenth Amendment rationally to determine what are the badges and the incidents of slavery, and the authority to translate that determination into effective legislation.\u00a0... this Court recognized long ago that, whatever else they may have encompassed, the badges and incidents of slavery\u2014its \"burdens and disabilities\"\u2014included restraints upon \"those fundamental rights which are the essence of civil freedom, namely, the same right\u00a0... to inherit, purchase, lease, sell and convey property, as is enjoyed by white citizens.\" Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3, 109 U. S. 22.\nJust as the Black Codes, enacted after the Civil War to restrict the free exercise of those rights, were substitutes for the slave system, so the exclusion of Negroes from white communities became a substitute for the Black Codes. And when racial discrimination herds men into ghettos and makes their ability to buy property turn on the color of their skin, then it too is a relic of slavery.\nNegro citizens, North and South, who saw in the Thirteenth Amendment a promise of freedom\u2014freedom to \"go and come at pleasure\" and to \"buy and sell when they please\"\u2014would be left with \"a mere paper guarantee\" if Congress were powerless to assure that a dollar in the hands of a Negro will purchase the same thing as a dollar in the hands of a white man. At the very least, the freedom that Congress is empowered to secure under the Thirteenth Amendment includes the freedom to buy whatever a white man can buy, the right to live wherever a white man can live. If Congress cannot say that being a free man means at least this much, then the Thirteenth Amendment made a promise the Nation cannot keep.\nThe Court in \"Jones\" reopened the issue of linking racism in contemporary society to the history of slavery in the United States.\nThe \"Jones\" precedent has been used to justify Congressional action to protect migrant workers and target sex trafficking. The direct enforcement power found in the Thirteenth Amendment contrasts with that of the Fourteenth, which allows only responses to institutional discrimination of state actors. The Supreme Court in \"Jones\" stated with respect to the reach of the Thirteenth Amendment: \"The Thirteenth Amendment \"is not a mere prohibition of State laws establishing or upholding slavery, but an absolute declaration that slavery or involuntary servitude shall not exist in any part of the United States.\" \"Civil Rights Cases\", 109 U. S. 3, 109 U. S. 20. It has never been doubted, therefore, \"that the power vested in Congress to enforce the article by appropriate legislation,\" \"ibid.\", includes the power to enact laws \"direct and primary, operating upon the acts of individuals, whether sanctioned by State legislation or not.\" \"Id.\" at 109 U. S. 23.\"\nOther cases of involuntary servitude.\nThe Supreme Court has taken an especially narrow view of involuntary servitude claims made by people not descended from black (African) slaves. In \"Robertson v. Baldwin\" (1897), a group of merchant seamen challenged federal statutes which criminalized a seaman's failure to complete their contractual term of service. The Court ruled that seamen's contracts had been considered unique from time immemorial, and that \"the amendment was not intended to introduce any novel doctrine with respect to certain descriptions of service which have always been treated as exceptional.\" In this case, as in numerous \"badges and incidents\" cases, Justice Harlan authored a dissent favoring broader Thirteenth Amendment protections.\nIn \"Selective Draft Law Cases\", the Supreme Court ruled that the military draft was not \"involuntary servitude\". In \"United States v. Kozminski\", the Supreme Court ruled that the Thirteenth Amendment did not prohibit compulsion of servitude through psychological coercion. \"Kozminski\" defined involuntary servitude for purposes of criminal prosecution as \"a condition of servitude in which the victim is forced to work for the defendant by the use or threat of physical restraint or physical injury or by the use or threat of coercion through law or the legal process. This definition encompasses cases in which the defendant holds the victim in servitude by placing him or her in fear of such physical restraint or injury or legal coercion.\"\nThe U.S. Courts of Appeals, in \"Immediato v. Rye Neck School District\", \"Herndon v. Chapel Hill\", and \"Steirer v. Bethlehem School District\", have ruled that the use of community service as a high school graduation requirement did not violate the Thirteenth Amendment.\nPrior proposed Thirteenth Amendments.\nDuring the six decades following the 1804 ratification of the Twelfth Amendment two proposals to amend the Constitution were adopted by Congress and sent to the states for ratification. Neither has been ratified by the number of states necessary to become part of the Constitution. Each is referred to as \"Article Thirteen\", as was the successful Thirteenth Amendment, in the joint resolution passed by Congress.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n* \"Response to McAward:\" https://\n* \"Response to Tsesis:\" https://\nBibliography.\n\"Maryland Law Review\", special issue: Symposium\u2014the Maryland Constitutional Law Schmooze\n\"Columbia Law Review\", special issue: Symposium: The Thirteenth Amendment: Meaning, Enforcement, and Contemporary Implications\n* https://\n* https://\n* https://\n* https://\n* https://\n* https://\n* https://\n* https://\n* https://\n* (link: https://)\n* (link: https://)\n* https://\n* https://\n* (link: https://)"}
{"id": "31666", "revid": "49507307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31666", "title": "Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution", "text": "1868 amendment addressing citizenship rights and civil and political liberties\nThe Fourteenth Amendment (Amendment XIV) to the United States Constitution was adopted on July 9, 1868, as one of the Reconstruction Amendments. Considered one of the most consequential amendments, it addresses citizenship rights and equal protection under the law at all levels of government. The Fourteenth Amendment was a response to issues affecting freed slaves following the American Civil War, and its enactment was bitterly contested. States of the defeated Confederacy were required to ratify it to regain representation in Congress. The amendment, particularly its first section, is one of the most litigated parts of the Constitution, forming the basis for landmark Supreme Court decisions, such as \"Brown v. Board of Education\" (1954; prohibiting racial segregation in public schools), \"Loving v. Virginia\" (1967; ending interracial marriage bans), \"Roe v. Wade\" (1973; recognizing federal right to abortion until overturned in 2022), \"Bush v. Gore\" (2000; settling the 2000 presidential election), \"Obergefell v. Hodges\" (2015; extending the right to marry to same-sex couples), and \"Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard\" (2023; prohibiting affirmative action in most college admissions).\nThe amendment's first section includes the Citizenship Clause, Privileges or Immunities Clause, Due Process Clause, and Equal Protection Clause. The Citizenship Clause broadly defines citizenship, superseding the Supreme Court's decision in \"Dred Scott v. Sandford\" (1857), which held that Americans descended from African slaves could not become American citizens. The Privileges or Immunities Clause was interpreted in the \"Slaughter-House Cases\" (1873) as preventing states from impeding federal rights, such as the freedom of movement. The Due Process Clause builds on the Fifth Amendment to prohibit all levels of government from depriving people of life, liberty, or property without substantive and procedural due process. Additionally, the Due Process Clause supports the incorporation doctrine, by which portions of the Bill of Rights have been applied to the states. The Equal Protection Clause requires each state to provide equal protection under the law to all people, including non-citizens, within its jurisdiction.\nThe second section superseded the Three-fifths Compromise, apportioning the House of Representatives and Electoral College using each state's adult male population. In allowing states to abridge voting rights \"for participation in rebellion, or other crime,\" this section approved felony disenfranchisement. The third section disqualifies federal and state candidates who \"have engaged in insurrection or rebellion,\" but in \"Trump v. Anderson\" (2024), the Supreme Court left its application to Congress for federal elections and state governments for state elections. The fourth section affirms public debt authorized by Congress while declining to compensate slaveholders for emancipation. The fifth section provides congressional power of enforcement, but Congress' authority to regulate private conduct has shifted to the Commerce Clause, while the anti-commandeering doctrine restrains federal interference in state law.\nSection 1: Citizenship and civil rights.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSection 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\nBackground.\nSection 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment formally defines United States citizenship and protects various civil rights from being abridged or denied by any state law or state action. In \"Shelley v. Kraemer\" (1948), the Supreme Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment's historical context of countering the discriminatory Black Codes of southern states must be used in its interpretation. Primarily written by Representative John Bingham, Section 1 is the most frequently litigated part of the amendment, and this amendment is the most frequently litigated part of the Constitution.\nCitizenship Clause.\nThe Citizenship Clause overruled the Supreme Court's \"Dred Scott\" decision that African Americans could not become citizens. The clause constitutionalized the Civil Rights Act of 1866's grant of citizenship to all born within the United States, except the children of foreign diplomats. Compared against European \"jus sanguinis\" laws that assign citizenship by one's parents, historians have framed the United States' Citizenship Clause as an extension of the Fourteenth Amendment's egalitarian principles.\nCongress' debate over the Citizenship Clause shows explicit rejection of Senator Edgar Cowan's anti-Romani sentiment, affirming that birthright citizenship cannot be revoked from children born to disfavored ethnic minorities. Birthright citizenship was meant to repudiate the American Colonization Society's repatriation of freeborn people of color and emancipated slaves to Africa. In \"United States v. Wong Kim Ark\" (1898), the Supreme Court confirmed that children born in the United States receive birthright citizenship, regardless of whether their parents are non-citizen immigrants.\nIn \"Elk v. Wilkins\" (1884), the Supreme Court interpreted the Citizenship Clause as granting birthright citizenship to all born within the jurisdiction of the United States and allowing Congress to establish alternative pathways for naturalization. Consistent with the views of the clause's author, Senator Jacob M. Howard, the Supreme Court held that because Indian reservations are not under the federal government's jurisdiction, Native Americans born on such land are not entitled to birthright citizenship. The 1887 Dawes Act offered citizenship to Native Americans who accepted private property as part of cultural assimilation, while the 1924 Indian Citizenship Act offered citizenship to all Native Americans born within the nation's territorial limits.\nIn \"Mackenzie v. Hare\" (1915), the Supreme Court upheld the Expatriation Act of 1907, which dictated that all American women who voluntarily married a foreign alien renounced their American citizenship. \"Perez v. Brownell\" (1958) similarly held that Congress could designate voting in foreign elections or draft evasion as renunciations of citizenship. However, in \"Afroyim v. Rusk\" (1967) and \"Vance v. Terrazas\" (1980), the Supreme Court reversed itself, holding that renunciations of American citizenship must be formally expressed.\nIn January 2025, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order 14160 to deny birthright citizenship to children with parents of illegal or temporary immigration status. While this topic was not considered by the 39th Congress, nor has it been addressed by the Supreme Court, enforcement of the Executive Order has been blocked as unconstitutional by multiple federal judges. Furthermore, many of the freed slaves whose children were covered by the Citizenship Clause were illegal immigrants brought in violation of the 1807 Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves.\nPrivileges or Immunities Clause.\nThe Privileges or Immunities Clause was written to provide congressional power of enforcement to the similar Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article Four of the Constitution. In 1823, Supreme Court Justice Bushrod Washington decided \"Corfield v. Coryell\", interpreting the latter clause as protecting the right to travel, seek habeas corpus, and hold property in multiple states, among other rights. In the \"Slaughter-House Cases\" (1873), the Supreme Court rejected arguments that the Privileges or Immunities Clause further incorporated the Bill of Rights against state governments or transferred police power to the federal government. In \"McDonald v. City of Chicago\" (2010) and \"Timbs v. Indiana\" (2019), Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas advocated transferring the incorporation doctrine from the Due Process Clause to the Privileges or Immunities Clause, but this has been criticized as a veiled attempt to restrict the rights of non-citizens within the United States.\nDue Process Clause.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDue process has not been reduced to any formula; its content cannot be determined by reference to any code. The best that can be said is that, through the course of this Court's decisions, it has represented the balance which our Nation, built upon postulates of respect for the liberty of the individual, has struck between that liberty and the demands of organized society. If the supplying of content to this constitutional concept has of necessity been a rational process, it certainly has not been one where judges have felt free to roam where unguided speculation might take them. The balance of which I speak is the balance struck by this country, having regard to what history teaches are the traditions from which it developed as well as the traditions from which it broke. That tradition is a living thing. A decision of this Court which radically departs from it could not long survive, while a decision which builds on what has survived is likely to be sound. No formula could serve as a substitute, in this area, for judgment and restraint.\n \u2014Associate Justice John M. Harlan II in his dissenting opinion to \"Poe v. Ullman\" 367 U.S. https:// (1961)\nThe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment explicitly applies the Fifth Amendment's similar clause to state governments. This reinforcement of due process rights was in response to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 allowing slave owners to recapture their fugitive slaves \"without process\" and rejecting the testimony of alleged fugitives. In protecting all people against arbitrary denial of life, liberty, or property, courts have recognized both procedural and substantive due process. Procedural due process deals with the processes for restraining life, liberty, or property, such as the right to be notified of a hearing by a neutral decision-maker. In comparison, substantive due process involves the government's justification for engaging in those processes. \nIn deciding whether legislation unconstitutionally infringes on one's liberty, most government acts are subject to rational basis review, under which the government must present a legitimate state interest and the law must be rationally related to advancing that interest. When the government infringes on fundamental rights, such as racial equality, strict scrutiny requires its actions to instead be narrowly tailored to address a compelling state interest.\nThe early 20th century has been referred to as the \"Lochner\" era for the Supreme Court's embrace of a freedom of contract in cases like \"Allgeyer v. Louisiana\" (1897) and \"Lochner v. New York\" (1905). While that freedom was ultimately curtailed in \"West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish\" (1937), those early cases recognized substantive due process rights within the Due Process Clause. For example, \"Meyer v. Nebraska\" (1923) and \"Pierce v. Society of Sisters\" (1925) struck down anti-immigrant state education laws as violations of substantive due process.\nIn 1890, future Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis and his law partner, Samuel D. Warren II, published \"The Right to Privacy\" in the \"Harvard Law Review\". While the article only advocated for tort actions to protect one's privacy, the Supreme Court later elevated privacy to a fundamental right, protecting contraceptive sales in \"Griswold v. Connecticut\" (1965), consensual sex in \"Lawrence v. Texas\" (2003), and same-sex marriage in \"Obergefell v. Hodges\" under substantive due process. In \"Roe v. Wade\" (1973), the Supreme Court recognized a substantive due process right to abortion, but that holding was overturned in \"Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization\" (2022), which stated that \"a right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nation\u2019s history and traditions.\"\nIncorporation of the Bill of Rights.\nPrior to the Fourteenth Amendment, the Supreme Court held in \"Barron v. Baltimore\" (1833) that the Bill of Rights only restrained the federal government. However, in \"Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Co. v. City of Chicago\" (1897), the Supreme Court applied the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause to the eminent domain power of state governments under the Due Process Clause, beginning an ongoing process of incorporation. Legal scholar Akhil Reed Amar has argued that while Congress intended the Fourteenth Amendment to reverse the \"Barron\" decision, Representative Bingham expected incorporation to rely on the Privileges or Immunities Clause. The Supreme Court has explicitly rejected incorporation of the Fifth Amendment's Grand Jury Clause and Seventh Amendment, and it has never addressed the Third Amendment.\nEqual Protection Clause.\nThe Equal Protection Clause was written to constitutionalize the anti-discrimination principles of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and prevent enforcement of the southern states' Black Codes. In \"Strauder v. West Virginia\" (1880), the Supreme Court recognized exclusion of African Americans from West Virginian juries as an unconstitutional infringement of this clause, triggering the 1866 law's provision to remove the underlying case to federal court. In \"Yick Wo v. Hopkins\" (1886), the Supreme Court clarified that race-neutral laws administered in discriminatory ways were similarly unconstitutional.\nWhereas the Privileges or Immunities Clause refers to citizens, this clause refers to all people within the jurisdiction of the United States. Accordingly, in \"Plyler v. Doe\" (1982), the Supreme Court prohibited state governments from restricting public education on the basis of a child's immigration status. In that decision, Justice William J. Brennan Jr. noted that in \"Wong Wing v. United States\" (1896), the Supreme Court had already recognized illegal immigrants as within American jurisdiction for the purposes of due process rights.\nWhile the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause incorporates the Bill of Rights against state governments, the Fifth Amendment's similar clause has been used for reverse incorporation of the Equal Protection Clause against the federal government. In \"Bolling v. Sharpe\" (1954), the Supreme Court used this doctrine to prevent the federal government from maintaining segregated public schools in Washington, D.C.\nWhile states can vary taxation by the taxpayer's profession or form of their property, the Equal Protection Clause restrains the government from engaging in discriminatory tax assessment. Additionally, in \"Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. Ward\" (1985), the Supreme Court treated the Equal Protection Clause as affirming the Dormant Commerce Clause doctrine against state protectionism. In \"Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Co.\" (1886), Supreme Court Reporter of Decisions Bancroft Davis affirmed corporate personhood in the decision's headnote without full discussion by the court. In \"Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis Railway Co. v. Beckwith\" (1889), the Supreme Court fully embraced this treatment of businesses as people.\nIn \"Plessy v. Ferguson\" (1896), the Supreme Court held that racial segregation laws did not violate the Equal Protection Clause, and in \"Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education\" (1899), it applied its \"separate but equal\" doctrine to uphold racial segregation in public schools. Through civil rights litigation, groups like the NAACP weakened this doctrine, culminating in \"Brown v. Board of Education\" (1954) holding segregated facilities to be inherently unequal. The ruling was met with \"massive resistance\" in southern states, leading state and federal courts to overturn many segregationist state laws.\nThe Supreme Court clarified in \"Hernandez v. Texas\" (1954) that the Equal Protection Clause applies to all racial groups. In \"Reed v. Reed\" (1971), the Supreme Court unanimously struck down an Idaho probate law favoring men in its first application of the Equal Protection Clause to sex discrimination. Responding to second-wave feminism, the Supreme Court ruled in \"Craig v. Boren\" (1976) that sex classifications would thereafter be subjected to intermediate scrutiny.\nThe Supreme Court ruled in \"Regents of the University of California v. Bakke\" (1978) that diverse student bodies were a compelling interest for universities while deeming racial quotas in public university admissions unconstitutional. In the 2003 companion cases \"Gratz v. Bollinger\" and \"Grutter v. Bollinger\", the Court continued to accept race-conscious admissions while striking down a points-based system that quantified minority status. In \"Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard\" (2023), the Supreme Court effectively overturned that precedent, declaring affirmative action unconstitutional in private universities that accept federal funds and all public universities except military academies.\nWith the 1964 cases \"Wesberry v. Sanders\" and \"Reynolds v. Sims\", the Supreme Court embraced a \"one man, one vote\" approach to apportioning congressional districts. While racial gerrymandering was held illegal in \"Shaw v. Reno\" (1993), partisan gerrymandering was deemed a political question in \"Rucho v. Common Cause\" (2019). In \"Bush v. Gore\" (2000), the Supreme Court required states to impose uniform ballot counting procedures across their counties under the Equal Protection Clause. Deeming a complete recount of the 2000 presidential election in Florida impractical, the Supreme Court accepted the Florida Secretary of State's prior vote certification, allowing George W. Bush to win the Electoral College.\nState actor doctrine.\nThe Eleventh Amendment provides state governments with sovereign immunity from federal lawsuits brought by citizens of other states, and in \"Hans v. Louisiana\" (1890), the Supreme Court held that it implies immunity from all lawsuits brought by private parties. In \"Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer\" (1976), the Supreme Court determined that Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment's congressional power of enforcement allows the federal government to limit state sovereign immunity.\nFurthermore, in \"Ex parte Young\" (1908), the Supreme Court held that private individuals could seek federal injunctions against state officials to prevent enforcement of unconstitutional laws, reasoning that unconstitutional conduct can never be a protected state action. Similarly, in \"Shelley v. Kraemer\" (1948), the Supreme Court held that while the federal government cannot prevent private parties from establishing racially discriminatory housing covenants, state and federal courts cannot enforce them.\nIn cases like \"Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co.\" (1974) and \"Flagg Bros., Inc. v. Brooks\" (1978), the Supreme Court clarified that state laws do not transform regulated businesses into state actors. Thus, private companies are free to engage in conduct that would be unconstitutional for state governments to pursue, though the federal government can prevent discriminatory private conduct under its Commerce Clause authority, and state governments may further regulate business operations.\nSection 2: Apportionment of representatives.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSection 2. Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.\nUnder the Enumeration Clause of Article I, the size of state delegations to the House of Representatives was apportioned by adding their free populations with three-fifths of their enslaved populations. After the Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery except as criminal punishment, Congress wrote Section 2 to reduce state representation based on the proportion of their male citizens aged 21 years or older that were denied voting rights. Since only two of the eleven referendums on African American suffrage held in northern states between 1865 and 1869 were successful, Congress assumed that the states would not ratify a nationwide grant of such voting rights. The Senate also rejected a House proposal ordering \"that whenever the elective franchise shall be denied or abridged in any State on account of race or color, all persons therein of such race or color shall be excluded from the basis of representation\" because it would have permitted race-neutral discrimination. \nSouthern states ignored this penalty, and Congress declined to enforce it, prompting the 1870 ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment to explicitly prohibit denial of voting rights \"on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\" Legal scholar Gabriel J. Chin has argued this repealed Section 2 to provide self-executing voting rights, but David Froomkin and Eric Eisner rebut that Section 2 still addresses other voting restrictions. For example, it is unsettled whether Section 2 penalizes states for sending delegations to the Electoral College that contravene their election results.\nIn \"Saunders v. Wilkins\" (1945), the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit dismissed whether Virginia's poll tax constituted a restriction of voting rights under Section 2 as a political question, which has been criticized because in 1872, Congress enacted a broad enabling statute under its Section 5 congressional power of enforcement (\u00a0https://). Interest in enforcing Section 2 further declined after the Voting Rights Act of 1965 prohibited racial discrimination in voting.\nIn \"Minor v. Happersett\" (1875), the Supreme Court rejected voting as among rights protected by the Privileges or Immunities Clause because Section 2 shows that the Fourteenth Amendment only recognizes the voting rights of male citizens aged 21 years or older. Representative James G. Blaine had defeated proposals for Section 2 to base representation on each state's voting population by warning that it would incentivize voting rights for women. Suffragettes condemned Section 2 and secured ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920 to prohibit sex-based denial of voting rights.\nIn \"Richardson v. Ramirez\" (1974), the Supreme Court upheld the Constitution of California's felony disenfranchisement provisions against an Equal Protection Clause challenge, reasoning that Section 2 allows states to punish crime with a permanent loss of voting rights. However, in \"Hunter v. Underwood\" (1985), the Supreme Court held that because a similar provision in the Alabama Constitution of 1901 was enacted with discriminatory intent, it was unenforceable. The 2020 California Proposition 17 restored the right to vote after completion of one's prison term, and as of 2025[ [update]], half of the states either automatically restore voting rights upon release from prison or never order disenfranchisement.\nSection 3: Disqualification from office for insurrection or rebellion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSection 3. No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may, by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.\nThe Insurrection Clause disqualifies candidates for state or federal offices if they previously took an oath to support the Constitution when sworn into a public office but then engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States. Prior to the Fourteenth Amendment's adoption, Congress could only disqualify federal officials through impeachment and removal proceedings, as it did for Tennessee District Court Judge West Hughes Humphreys in 1862, and it held no authority over state offices. When Alexander H. Stephens, the former Vice President of the Confederate States of America, was elected to represent Georgia as a Senator in the 39th US Congress, the Republican-dominated Congress blocked him from taking office. To address the process of readmitting Confederate states, Congress established the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, whose work expanded beyond this clause to the overall Fourteenth Amendment.\nUsing Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment's congressional power of enforcement, the Enforcement Act of 1870 authorized federal prosecutors to issue writs of quo warranto to remove those disqualified by the Insurrection Clause from their political offices. In 1942, Congress' revisions of the US Code eliminated that provision. However, a section of the Confiscation Act of 1862 (\u00a0https://), which precedes the Fourteenth Amendment, continues to disqualify anyone who \"incites, sets on foot, assists, or engages in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States.\"\nFinding that it had severely underestimated those affected by Section 3, Congress exercised its authority to remove a disqualification with a two-thirds majority in each chamber by passing the Amnesty Act in 1872. This law exempted all Confederates except former Senators, Representatives, federal judges, military officers, cabinet officials, and ambassadors. In 1898, Congress exempted all people then living and disqualified by Section 3, but the Insurrection Clause continues to disqualify those who engage in subsequent insurrection or rebellion. During the 1970s, Congress posthumously lifted the disqualification of Confederate General-in-Chief Robert E. Lee and President Jefferson Davis, both of whom died before the 1898 amnesty.\nIn the only invocation of Section 3 between Reconstruction and 2021, Congress deemed Victor L. Berger disqualified by his conviction under the Espionage Act of 1917 and refused to seat him for the 66th US Congress. After that conviction was overturned based on judicial bias in \"Berger v. United States\" (1921), Berger represented Wisconsin's 5th congressional district for three terms.\nAfter President Donald Trump instigated the January 6 Capitol attack to disrupt the 2021 Electoral College vote count, a group of Colorado voters contested his presidential eligibility under Section 3, seeking to disqualify him from the state's ballots in the 2024 presidential election. In \"Trump v. Anderson\" (2024), the Supreme Court held that Section 5 delegates enforcement of the Insurrection Clause to Congress for federal and state officers, while allowing states to also impose disqualification on state candidates. Though the Electoral Count Reform Act of 2022 allows a fifth of members in each chamber of Congress to object to electors whose votes are not \"regularly given,\" which includes constitutional disqualification, no such objections were raised at the 2025 Electoral College vote count.\nA similar group of North Carolina voters sued in federal court to disqualify Representative Madison Cawthorn, but he lost the 2022 Republican primary for his district prior to a verdict. After New Mexico state courts removed Otero County commissioner Couy Griffin under Section 3, the Supreme Court declined his appeal, maintaining his disqualification from state and local offices.\nSection 4: Validity of public debt.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSection 4. The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned. But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void.\nSection 4 legitimizes all public debt appropriated by the Congress while rejecting debt associated with emancipation and the Confederacy. In the Gold Clause Cases, the Supreme Court held that Congress' authority over monetary policy allowed it to pass the Emergency Banking Act of 1933, despite the law's practical effect of invalidating gold clauses, which allowed creditors to demand payment in gold. In the 21st century, constitutional law scholars have debated whether Section 4 authorizes the President to unilaterally raise the debt ceiling when Congress is unwilling. In 2011, former President Bill Clinton argued that Section 4 requires the Executive Branch to ignore the debt ceiling in its fulfillment of congressional appropriations.\nSection 5: Power of enforcement.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSection 5. The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.\nIn the \"Slaughter-House Cases\", 83 U.S. (16 Wall.) 36 (1873), the Supreme Court opined that Section 5 empowered Congress to enforce the Equal Protection Clause on states that refused to repeal their Black Codes. However, the \"Civil Rights Cases\" (1883) held that the Fourteenth Amendment does not empower Congress to outlaw racial discrimination by private individuals. In \"Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States\" (1964), the Supreme Court upheld similar legislation under the Commerce Clause instead.\nIn \"Katzenbach v. Morgan\" (1966), the Supreme Court upheld Voting Rights Act of 1965's elimination of literacy tests by claiming that Congress could expand civil rights further than the judiciary. However, \"City of Boerne v. Flores\" (1997) rejected application of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act on state governments because it modified rights under the Free Exercise Clause, rather than protecting existing rights.\nSelected Supreme Court cases.\nCitizenship.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPrivileges or immunities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIncorporation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSubstantive due process.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEqual protection.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPower of enforcement.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAdoption.\nProposal by Congress.\nIn the final years of the American Civil War and subsequent Reconstruction era, Congress repeatedly debated the rights of former slaves freed by the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation and the 1865 Thirteenth Amendment, the latter of which formally abolished slavery. Concerned that southern states would use their African American residents to enlarge their congressional representation while infringing on the civil rights of these freedmen, Republicans sought to discourage such disenfranchisement.\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1866 guaranteed citizenship without regard to race, color, or prior enslavement. The bill also guaranteed equal benefits and access to the law, attacking the discriminatory Black Codes passed by formerly Confederate states to restrict the movement, employment, self-defense, and legal rights of African Americans. Ignoring the urging of moderate Republicans, President Andrew Johnson vetoed the bill on March 27, 1866. In his veto message, Johnson framed the expansion of citizenship to African Americans as racial discrimination for leaving eleven southern states without congressional representation. Three weeks later, Johnson's veto was overridden and the measure became law. Unsure of their constitutional power to pass and enforce the law, especially if Southern Democrats retook Congress, the experience prompted drafting for a constitutional amendment to protect these civil rights.\nMore than seventy proposals for an amendment were drafted. In an extensive appendix to his dissenting opinion in \"Adamson v. California\" (1947), Justice Hugo Black detailed statements made by \"those who framed, advocated, and adopted the Amendment.\" In late 1865, the Joint Committee on Reconstruction proposed an amendment where states would only receive representation for their citizens with voting rights. This amendment passed the House, but it was blocked in the Senate by a coalition of Radical Republicans led by Charles Sumner, who considered the proposal a \"compromise with wrong,\" and Democrats opposed to black rights. Consideration turned to an amendment by Representative John A. Bingham of Ohio, enabling Congress to safeguard \"equal protection of life, liberty, and property\" of all citizens, but this proposal failed in the House.\nIn April 1866, the Joint Committee forwarded a third version to Congress, which combined the prior proposals, rejected Confederate debt, and addressed voting by ex-Confederates. Social reformer Robert Dale Owen led the decision to combine the proposals into the constitution's longest amendment, reasoning that its popular provisions would secure its overall ratification. On May 29, 1866, the House passed this third version as House Resolution 127. The Senate amended Sections 2, 3, and4, passing the modified version on June 8 by a 33\u201311 vote (five not voting). The House agreed to the Senate amendments on June 13 by a 138\u201336 vote (ten not voting). A concurrent resolution requesting the President to transmit the proposal to state governors was passed by both houses of Congress on June 18.\nThe Radical Republicans lamented that the Fourteenth Amendment only expanded civil rights while leaving political rights unaddressed. Thaddeus Stevens opined, \"I find that we shall be obliged to be content with patching up the worst portions of the ancient edifice, and leaving it, in many of its parts, to be swept through by the tempests, the frosts, and the storms of despotism.\" Abolitionist Wendell Phillips called it a \"fatal and total surrender,\" prompting the Fifteenth Amendment to prohibit government denial of the right to vote \"on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\"\nRatification by the states.\nOn June 16, 1866, Secretary of State William H. Seward transmitted the Fourteenth Amendment to state governors for ratification. After state legislatures in every formerly Confederate state except Tennessee refused to ratify it, Congress passed the Reconstruction Acts, which conditioned readmission on ratification. The first 28 states to ratify the Fourteenth Amendment were:\nAfter retaking the state legislatures of New Jersey and Ohio, Democrats rescinded their ratifications. On July 20, 1868, Seward certified that if rescissions are invalid, the amendment became law with South Carolina's ratification as the 28th state. The following day, Congress rejected New Jersey's rescission as \"scandalous\", declaring the Fourteenth Amendment as part of the Constitution and directing Seward to promulgate it as such, establishing that states cannot rescind their ratification:\nUpon receiving Georgia's ratification on July 27, Seward officially proclaimed the Fourteenth Amendment's adoption, listing all thirty ratifying states to prevent federal courts from recognizing rescission. On October 16, 1868, three months after adoption, Oregon rescinded its ratification, but this had no impact on Fourteenth Amendment's validity. The Fourteenth Amendment was subsequently ratified by the following states:\nSince Ohio and New Jersey re-ratified the Fourteenth Amendment in 2003, all states that existed during Reconstruction have ratified the amendment.\nProposed revision.\nIn response to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937, Senator William Borah proposed a constitutional amendment that would repeal and revise the Fourteenth Amendment, analogous to the 1933 Twenty-First Amendment modifying the Eighteenth Amendment. Borah's amendment would have excluded substantive due process rights, explicitly incorporated the First Amendment against state governments, eliminated the Section 2 penalty for denied voting rights, and omitted Sections 3 and 4. In March 1937, the switch in time that saved nine ended the Lochner era, diminishing interest in either of these judicial reforms.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n* \"See also\": http:// special issue of the \"Maryland Law Review\".\n* \"Response to McConnell:\" \n* \"Response to Klarman:\" "}

By 1869, amendments had been passed to abolish slavery and provide citizenship and equal protection under the laws, but the election of Ulysses S. Grant to the presidency in 1868 convinced a majority of Republicans that protecting the franchise of black male voters was important for the party's future. On February 26, 1869, after rejecting more sweeping versions of a suffrage amendment, Republicans proposed a compromise amendment which would ban franchise restrictions on the basis of race, color, or previous servitude. After surviving a difficult ratification fight and opposition from Democrats, the amendment was certified as duly ratified and part of the Constitution on March 30, 1870. According to the Library of Congress, in the House of Representatives 144 Republicans voted to approve the 15th Amendment, with zero Democrats in favor, 39 no votes, and seven abstentions. In the Senate, 33 Republicans voted to approve, Thomas Kruel with zero Democrats in favor.\nUnited States Supreme Court decisions in the late nineteenth century interpreted the amendment narrowly. From 1890 to 1910, the Democratic Party in the Southern United States adopted new state constitutions and enacted \"Jim Crow\" laws that raised barriers to voter registration. This resulted in most black voters and many Poor Whites being disenfranchised by poll taxes and literacy tests, among other barriers to voting, from which white male voters were exempted by grandfather clauses. A system of white primaries and violent intimidation by Democrats through the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) also suppressed black participation. Although the fifteenth amendment is \"self-executing\" the Court emphasized that the right granted to be free from racial discrimination could be enforced by congressional enactments when necessary.\nIn the twentieth century, the Court began to interpret the amendment more broadly, striking down grandfather clauses in \"Guinn v. United States\" (1915) and dismantling the white primary system created by the Democratic Party in the \"Texas primary cases\" (1927\u20131953). Voting rights were further incorporated into the Constitution in the Nineteenth Amendment (voting rights for women, effective 1920), the Twenty-fourth Amendment (prohibiting poll taxes in federal elections, effective 1964) and the Twenty-sixth Amendment (lowering the voting age from 21 to 18, effective 1971). The Voting Rights Act of 1965 provided federal oversight of elections in discriminatory jurisdictions, banned literacy tests and similar discriminatory devices, and created legal remedies for people affected by voting discrimination. The Court also found poll taxes in state elections unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment in \"Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections\" (1966).\nText.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Section 1. The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\nSection 2. The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.\nBackground.\nIn the final years of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction Era that followed, Congress repeatedly debated the rights of black former slaves freed by the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation and the 1865 Thirteenth Amendment, the latter of which had formally abolished slavery. Following the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment by Congress, however, Republicans grew concerned over the increase it would create in the congressional representation of the Democratic-dominated Southern states. Because the full population of freed slaves would be now counted rather than the three-fifths mandated by the previous Three-Fifths Compromise, the Southern states would dramatically increase their power in the population-based House of Representatives. Republicans hoped to offset this advantage by attracting and protecting votes of the newly enfranchised black population.\nIn 1865, Congress passed what would become the Civil Rights Act of 1866, guaranteeing citizenship without regard to race, color, or previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude. The bill also guaranteed equal benefits and access to the law, a direct assault on the Black Codes passed by many post-war Southern states. The Black Codes attempted to return ex-slaves to something like their former condition by, among other things, restricting their movement, forcing them to enter into year-long labor contracts, prohibiting them from owning firearms, and by preventing them from suing or testifying in court. Although strongly urged by moderates in Congress to sign the bill, President Johnson vetoed it on March 27, 1866. In his veto message, he objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen at a time when 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in the Congress, and that it allegedly discriminated in favor of African Americans and against whites. Three weeks later, Johnson's veto was overridden and the measure became law. Despite this victory, even some Republicans who had supported the goals of the Civil Rights Act began to doubt that Congress possessed the constitutional power to turn those goals into laws. The experience encouraged both radical and moderate Republicans to seek Constitutional guarantees for black rights, rather than relying on temporary political majorities.\nOn June 18, 1866, Congress adopted the Fourteenth Amendment, which guaranteed citizenship and equal protection under the laws regardless of race, and sent it to the states for ratification. After a bitter struggle that included attempted rescissions of ratification by two states, the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted on July 28, 1868.\nSection 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment punished, by reduced representation in the House of Representatives, any state that disenfranchised any male citizens over 21 years of age. By failing to adopt a harsher penalty, this signaled to the states that they still possessed the right to deny ballot access based on race. Northern states were generally as averse to granting voting rights to blacks as Southern states. In the year of its ratification, only eight Northern states allowed blacks to vote. In the South, blacks were able to vote in many areas, but only through the intervention of the occupying Union Army. Before Congress had granted suffrage to blacks in the territories by passing the Territorial Suffrage Act on January 10, 1867 (Source: Congressional Globe, 39th Congress, 2nd Session, pp. 381\u201382), blacks were granted the right to vote in the District of Columbia on January 8, 1867.\nProposal and ratification.\nProposal.\nAnticipating an increase in Democratic membership in the following Congress, Republicans used the lame-duck session of the 40th United States Congress to pass an amendment protecting black suffrage. Representative John Bingham, the primary author of the Fourteenth Amendment, pushed for a wide-ranging ban on suffrage limitations, but a broader proposal banning voter restriction on the basis of \"race, color, nativity, property, education, or religious beliefs\" was rejected. A proposal to specifically ban literacy tests was also rejected. Some Representatives from the North, where nativism was a major force, wished to preserve restrictions denying the franchise to foreign-born citizens, as did Representatives from the West, where ethnic Chinese people were banned from voting. Both Southern and Northern Republicans also wanted to continue to deny the vote temporarily to Southerners disenfranchised for support of the Confederacy, and they were concerned that a sweeping endorsement of suffrage would enfranchise this group.\nA House and Senate conference committee proposed the amendment's final text, which banned voter restriction only on the basis of \"race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\" To attract the broadest possible base of support, the amendment made no mention of poll taxes or other measures to block voting, and did not guarantee the right of blacks to hold office. Preliminary drafts did include officeholding language, but scholars disagree as to the reason for this change. This compromised proposal was approved by the House on February 25, 1869, and the Senate the following day.\nThe vote in the House was 144 to 44, with 35 not voting. The House vote was almost entirely along party lines, with no Democrats supporting the bill and only 3Republicans voting against it, some because they thought the amendment did not go far enough in its protections. The House of Representatives passed the amendment, with 143 Republicans and oneConservative Republican voting \"Yea\" and 39 Democrats, three Republicans, oneIndependent Republican and oneConservative voting \"No\"; 26 Republicans, eightDemocrats, and oneIndependent Republican did not vote. The final vote in the Senate was 39 to 13, with 14 not voting. The Senate passed the amendment, with 39 Republicans voting \"Yea\" and eightDemocrats and five Republicans voting \"Nay\"; 13 Republicans and oneDemocrat did not vote. Some Radical Republicans, such as Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner, abstained from voting because the amendment did not prohibit literacy tests and poll taxes. Following congressional approval, the proposed amendment was then sent by Secretary of State William Henry Seward to the states for ratification or rejection.\nRatification.\nThough many of the original proposals for the amendment had been moderated by negotiations in committee, the final draft nonetheless faced significant hurdles in being ratified by three-fourths of the states. Historian William Gillette wrote of the process, \"it was hard going and the outcome was uncertain until the very end.\"\nOne source of opposition to the proposed amendment was the women's suffrage movement, which before and during the Civil War had made common cause with the abolitionist movement. State constitutions often connected race and sex by limiting suffrage to \"white male citizens\". However, with the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, which had explicitly protected only male citizens in its second section, activists found the civil rights of women divorced from those of blacks. Matters came to a head with the proposal of the Fifteenth Amendment, which barred race discrimination but not sex discrimination in voter laws. One of Congress's most explicit discussions regarding the link between suffrage and officeholding occurred during discussions about the Fifteenth Amendment. Initially, both houses passed a version of the amendment that included language referring to officeholding but ultimately the language was omitted. \nDuring this time, women continued to advocate for their own rights, holding conventions and passing resolutions demanding the right to vote and hold office. Some preliminary versions of the amendment even included women. However, the final version omitted references to sex, further splintering the women's suffrage movement. After an acrimonious debate, the American Equal Rights Association, the nation's leading suffragist group, split into two rival organizations: the National Woman Suffrage Association of Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who opposed the amendment, and the American Woman Suffrage Association of Lucy Stone and Henry Browne Blackwell, who supported it. The two groups remained divided until the 1890s.\nNevada was the first state to ratify the amendment, on March 1, 1869. The New England states and most Midwest states also ratified the amendment soon after its proposal. Southern states still controlled by Radical reconstruction governments, such as North Carolina, also swiftly ratified. Newly elected President Ulysses S. Grant strongly endorsed the amendment, calling it \"a measure of grander importance than any other one act of the kind from the foundation of our free government to the present day.\" He privately asked Nebraska's governor to call a special legislative session to speed the process, securing the state's ratification. In April and December 1869, Congress passed Reconstruction bills mandating that Virginia, Mississippi, Texas and Georgia ratify the amendment as a precondition to regaining congressional representation; all four states did so. The struggle for ratification was particularly close in Indiana and Ohio, which voted to ratify in May 1869 and January 1870, respectively. New York, which had ratified on April 14, 1869, tried to revoke its ratification on January 5, 1870. However, in February 1870, Georgia, Iowa, Nebraska, and Texas ratified the amendment, bringing the total ratifying states to twenty-nine\u2014one more than the required twenty-eight ratifications from the thirty-seven states, and forestalling any court challenge to New York's resolution to withdraw its consent.\nThe first twenty-eight states to ratify the Fifteenth Amendment were:\nSecretary of State Hamilton Fish certified the amendment on March 30, 1870, also including the ratifications of:\nThe remaining seven states all subsequently ratified the amendment:\nThe amendment's adoption was met with widespread celebrations in black communities and abolitionist societies; many of the latter disbanded, feeling that black rights had been secured and their work was complete. President Grant said of the amendment that it \"completes the greatest civil change and constitutes the most important event that has occurred since the nation came to life.\" Many Republicans felt that with the amendment's passage, black Americans no longer needed federal protection; congressman and future president James A. Garfield stated that the amendment's passage \"confers upon the African race the care of its own destiny. It places their fortunes in their own hands.\" Congressman John R. Lynch later wrote that ratification of those two amendments made Reconstruction a success.\nApplication.\nIn the year of the 150th anniversary of the Fifteenth Amendment Columbia University history professor and historian Eric Foner said about the Fifteenth Amendment as well as its history during the Reconstruction era and Post-Reconstruction era:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It's a remarkable accomplishment given that slavery was such a dominant institution before the Civil War. But the history of the 15th Amendment also shows rights can never be taken for granted: Things can be achieved and things can be taken away.\nReconstruction.\nAfrican Americans called the amendment the nation's \"second birth\" and a \"greater revolution than that of 1776\", according to historian Eric Foner in his book \"The Second Founding: How the Civil War and Reconstruction Remade the Constitution\". The first black person known to vote after the amendment's adoption was Thomas Mundy Peterson, who cast his ballot on March 31, 1870, in a Perth Amboy, New Jersey, referendum election adopting a revised city charter. African Americans\u2014many of them newly freed slaves\u2014put their newfound freedom to use, voting in scores of black candidates. During Reconstruction, 16 black men served in Congress and 2,000 black men served in elected local, state, and federal positions. White supremacists, such as the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), used paramilitary violence to prevent blacks from voting. The Enforcement Acts were passed by Congress in 1870\u20131871 to authorize federal prosecution of the KKK and others who violated the amendment. \nIn \"United States v. Reese\" (1876), the first U.S. Supreme Court decision interpreting the Fifteenth Amendment, the Court interpreted the amendment narrowly, upholding ostensibly race-neutral limitations on suffrage, including poll taxes, literacy tests, and a grandfather clause that exempted citizens from other voting requirements if their grandfathers had been registered voters. The Court also stated that the amendment does not confer the right of suffrage, but it invests citizens of the United States with the right of exemption from discrimination in the exercise of the elective franchise on account of their race, color, or previous condition of servitude, and empowers Congress to enforce that right by \"appropriate legislation\". The Court wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nA number of blacks were killed at the Colfax massacre of 1873 while attempting to defend their right to vote. In \"United States v. Cruikshank\" (1876, decided the same day as \"Reese\"), the Supreme Court ruled that the federal government did not have the authority to prosecute the perpetrators of the Colfax massacre because they were not state actors.\nIn 1877, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes was elected president after a highly contested election, receiving support from three Southern states in exchange for a pledge to allow white Democratic governments to rule without federal interference. As president, he refused to enforce federal civil rights protections, allowing states to begin to implement racially discriminatory Jim Crow laws. Federal troops were withdrawn and prosecutions under the Enforcement Acts dropped significantly.\nPost-Reconstruction.\nIn \"Ex Parte Yarbrough\" (1884), the Court allowed individuals who were not state actors to be prosecuted because Article I, Section 4, gives Congress the power to regulate federal elections.\nA Federal Elections Bill (the \"Lodge Bill\" of 1890) was successfully filibustered in the Senate.\nCongress further weakened the Enforcement Acts in 1894 by removing a provision against conspiracy.\nFrom 1890 to 1910, poll taxes and literacy tests were instituted across the South, effectively disenfranchising the great majority of black men. White male-only primary elections also served to reduce the influence of black men in the political system. Along with increasing legal obstacles, blacks were excluded from the political system by threats of violent reprisals by whites in the form of lynch mobs and terrorist attacks by the Ku Klux Klan. Some Democrats even advocated a repeal of the amendment, such as William Bourke Cockran of New York.\nIn the 20th century, the Court began to read the Fifteenth Amendment more broadly. In \"Guinn v. United States\" (1915), a unanimous Court struck down an Oklahoma grandfather clause that effectively exempted white voters from a literacy test, finding it to be discriminatory. The Court ruled in the related case \"Myers v. Anderson\" (1915), that the officials who enforced such a clause were liable for civil damages.\nThe Court addressed the white primary system in a series of decisions later known as the \"Texas primary cases\". In \"Nixon v. Herndon\" (1927), Dr. Lawrence A. Nixon sued for damages under federal civil rights laws after being denied a ballot in a Democratic party primary election on the basis of race. The Court found in his favor on the basis of the Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees equal protection under the law, while not discussing his Fifteenth Amendment claim. After Texas amended its statute to allow the political party's state executive committee to set voting qualifications, Nixon sued again; in \"Nixon v. Condon\" (1932), the Court again found in his favor on the basis of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nFollowing \"Nixon\", the Democratic Party's state convention instituted a rule that only whites could vote in its primary elections; the Court unanimously upheld this rule as constitutional in \"Grovey v. Townsend\" (1935), distinguishing the discrimination by a private organization from that of the state in the previous primary cases. However, in \"United States v. Classic\" (1941), the Court ruled that primary elections were an essential part of the electoral process, undermining the reasoning in \"Grovey\". Based on \"Classic\", the Court in \"Smith v. Allwright\" (1944), overruled \"Grovey\", ruling that denying non-white voters a ballot in primary elections was a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment. In the last of the Texas primary cases, \"Terry v. Adams\" (1953), the Court ruled that black plaintiffs were entitled to damages from a group that organized whites-only pre-primary elections with the assistance of Democratic party officials.\nThe Court also used the amendment to strike down a gerrymander in \"Gomillion v. Lightfoot\" (1960). The decision found that the redrawing of city limits by Tuskegee, Alabama officials to exclude the mostly black area around the Tuskegee Institute discriminated on the basis of race. The Court later relied on this decision in \"Rice v. Cayetano\" (2000), which struck down ancestry-based voting in elections for the Office of Hawaiian Affairs; the ruling held that the elections violated the Fifteenth Amendment by using \"ancestry as a racial definition and for a racial purpose\".\nAfter judicial enforcement of the Fifteenth Amendment ended grandfather clauses, white primaries, and other discriminatory tactics, Southern black voter registration gradually increased, rising from five percent in 1940 to twenty-eight percent in 1960. Although the Fifteenth Amendment was never interpreted to prohibit poll taxes, in 1962 the Twenty-fourth Amendment was adopted banning poll taxes in federal elections, and in 1966 the Supreme Court ruled in \"Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections\" (1966) that state poll taxes violate the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.\nCongress used its authority pursuant to Section2 of the Fifteenth Amendment to pass the Voting Rights Act of 1965, achieving further racial equality in voting. Sections 4 and5 of the Voting Rights Act required states and local governments with histories of racial discrimination in voting to submit all changes to their voting laws or practices to the federal government for approval before they could take effect, a process called \"preclearance\". By 1976, sixty-three percent of Southern blacks were registered to vote, a figure only five percent less than that for Southern whites.\nThe Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Sections 4 and5 in \"South Carolina v. Katzenbach\" (1966). However, in \"Shelby County v. Holder\" (2013), the Supreme Court ruled that Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act, which established the coverage formula that determined which jurisdictions were subject to preclearance, was no longer constitutional and exceeded Congress's enforcement authority under Section2 of the Fifteenth Amendment. The Court declared that the Fifteenth Amendment \"commands that the right to vote shall not be denied or abridged on account of race or color, and it gives Congress the power to enforce that command. The Amendment is not designed to punish for the past; its purpose is to ensure a better future.\" According to the Court, \"Regardless of how to look at the record no one can fairly say that it shows anything approaching the 'pervasive', 'flagrant', 'widespread', and 'rampant' discrimination that faced Congress in 1965, and that clearly distinguished the covered jurisdictions from the rest of the nation.\" In dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote, \"Throwing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.\" While the preclearance provision itself was not struck down, it will continue to be inoperable unless Congress passes a new coverage formula.\nReferences.\nInformational notes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography"}

It was passed by Congress in 1909 in response to the 1895 Supreme Court case of \"Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co.\" The Sixteenth Amendment was ratified by the requisite number of states on February 3, 1913, and effectively overruled the Supreme Court's ruling in \"Pollock\".\nPrior to the early 20th century, most federal revenue came from tariffs rather than taxes, although Congress had often imposed excise taxes on various goods. The Revenue Act of 1861 had introduced the first federal income tax, but that tax was repealed in 1872. During the late nineteenth century, various groups, including the Populist Party, favored the establishment of a progressive income tax at the federal level. These groups believed that tariffs unfairly taxed the poor, and they favored using the income tax to shift the tax burden onto wealthier individuals. The 1894 Wilson\u2013Gorman Tariff Act contained an income tax provision, but the tax was struck down by the Supreme Court in the case of \"Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co.\" In its ruling, the Supreme Court did not hold that all federal income taxes were unconstitutional, but rather held that income taxes on rents, dividends, and interest were direct taxes and thus had to be apportioned among the states on the basis of population.\nFor several years after \"Pollock\", Congress did not attempt to implement another income tax, largely due to concerns that the Supreme Court would strike down any attempt to levy an income tax. In 1909, during the debate over the Payne\u2013Aldrich Tariff Act, Congress proposed the Sixteenth Amendment to the states. Though conservative Republican leaders had initially expected that the amendment would not be ratified, a coalition of Democrats, progressive Republicans, and other groups ensured that the necessary number of states ratified the amendment. Shortly after the amendment was ratified, Congress imposed a federal income tax with the Revenue Act of 1913. The Supreme Court upheld that income tax in the 1916 case of \"Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad Co.\", and the federal government has continued to levy an income tax since 1913.\nCritics of the Sixteenth Amendment have argued that it enables expansive federal government spending and facilitates central banking policies, with some, including Congressman Ron Paul, calling for its repeal on these and related grounds.\nText.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.\nOther constitutional provisions regarding taxes.\nArticle I, Section 2, Clause 3:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nArticle I, Section 8, Clause 1:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Congress shall have Power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States.\nArticle I, Section 9, Clause 4:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken.\nThis clause basically refers to a tax on property, such as a tax based on the value of land, as well as a capitation.\nArticle I, Section 9, Clause 5:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;No Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State.\nIncome taxes before the \"Pollock\" case.\nUntil 1913, customs duties (tariffs) and excise taxes were the primary sources of federal revenue. During the War of 1812, Secretary of the Treasury Alexander J. Dallas made the first public proposal for an income tax, but it was never implemented. The Congress did introduce an income tax to fund the Civil War through the Revenue Act of 1861. It levied a flat tax of three percent on annual income above $800. This act was replaced the following year with the Revenue Act of 1862, which levied a graduated tax of three to five percent on income above $600 and specified a termination of income taxation in 1866. The Civil War income taxes, which expired in 1872, proved to be both highly lucrative and drawing mostly from the more industrialized states, with New York, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts generating about 60 percent of the total revenue that was collected. During the two decades following the expiration of the Civil War income tax, the Greenback movement, the Labor Reform Party, the Populist Party, the Democratic Party and many others called for a graduated income tax.\nThe Socialist Labor Party advocated a graduated income tax in 1887. The Populist Party \"demand[ed] a graduated income tax\" in its 1892 platform. The Democratic Party, led by William Jennings Bryan, advocated the income tax law passed in 1894, and proposed an income tax in its 1908 platform. Proponents of the income tax generally believed that high tariff rates exacerbated income inequality, and wanted to use the income tax to shift the burden of funding the government away from working class consumers and to high-earning businessmen.\nBefore \"Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co.\", all income taxes had been considered to be indirect taxes imposed without respect to geography, unlike direct taxes, that have to be apportioned among the states according to population.\nThe \"Pollock\" case.\nIn 1894, an amendment was attached to the Wilson\u2013Gorman Tariff Act that attempted to impose a federal tax of two percent on incomes over $4,000 (equal to $,000 in 2024). The federal income tax was strongly favored in the South, and it was moderately supported in the eastern North Central states, but it was strongly opposed in the Far West and the Northeastern States (with the exception of New Jersey). The tax was derided as \"un-Democratic, inquisitorial, and wrong in principle\".\nIn \"Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co.\", the U.S. Supreme Court declared certain taxes on incomes, such as those on property under the 1894 Act, to be unconstitutionally unapportioned direct taxes. The Court reasoned that a tax on \"income from property\" should be treated as a tax on \"property by reason of its ownership\" and so should be required to be apportioned. The reasoning was that taxes on the rents from land, the dividends from stocks, and so forth, burdened the property generating the income in the same way that a tax on \"property by reason of its ownership\" burdened that property.\nAfter \"Pollock\", while income taxes on wages (as indirect taxes) were still not required to be apportioned by population, taxes on interest, dividends, and rental income were required to be apportioned by population. The \"Pollock\" ruling made the \"source of the income\" (e.g., property versus labor, etc.) relevant in determining whether the tax imposed on that income was deemed to be \"direct\" (and thus required to be apportioned among the states according to population) or, alternatively, \"indirect\" (and thus required only to be imposed with geographical uniformity).\nDissenting in \"Pollock\", Justice John Marshall Harlan stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When, therefore, this court adjudges, as it does now adjudge, that Congress cannot impose a duty or tax upon personal property, or upon income arising either from rents of real estate or from personal property, including invested personal property, bonds, stocks, and investments of all kinds, except by apportioning the sum to be so raised among the States according to population, it practically decides that, without an amendment of the Constitution\u2014two-thirds of both Houses of Congress and three-fourths of the States concurring\u2014such property and incomes can never be made to contribute to the support of the national government.\nMembers of Congress responded to \"Pollock\" by expressing widespread concern that many of the wealthiest Americans had consolidated too much economic power. Nonetheless, in the years after \"Pollock\", Congress did not implement another federal income tax, partly because many Congressmen feared that any tax would be struck down by the Supreme Court. Few considered attempting to impose an apportioned income tax, since such a tax was widely regarded as unworkable.\nAdoption.\nOn June 16, 1909, President William Howard Taft, in an address to the Sixty-first Congress, proposed a two percent federal income tax on corporations by way of an excise tax and a constitutional amendment to allow the previously enacted income tax.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Upon the privilege of doing business as an artificial entity and of freedom from a general partnership liability enjoyed by those who own the stock.\nAn income tax amendment to the Constitution was first proposed by Senator Norris Brown of Nebraska. He submitted two proposals, Senate Resolutions Nos. 25 and 39. The amendment proposal finally accepted was Senate Joint Resolution No. 40, introduced by Senator Nelson W. Aldrich of Rhode Island, the Senate majority leader and Finance Committee Chairman. The amendment was proposed as part of the congressional debate over the 1909 Payne\u2013Aldrich Tariff Act; by proposing the amendment, Aldrich hoped to temporarily defuse progressive calls for the imposition of new taxes in the tariff act. Aldrich and other conservative leaders in Congress largely opposed the actual ratification of the amendment, but they believed that it had little chance of being ratified, as ratification required approval by three quarters of the state legislatures.\nOn July 12, 1909, the resolution proposing the Sixteenth Amendment was passed by the Congress and was submitted to the state legislatures. Support for the income tax was strongest in the western and southern states, while opposition was strongest in the northeastern states. Supporters of the income tax believed that it would be a much better method of gathering revenue than tariffs, which were the primary source of revenue at the time. From well before 1894, Democrats, Progressives, Populists and other left-oriented parties argued that tariffs disproportionately affected the poor, interfered with prices, were unpredictable, and were an intrinsically limited source of revenue. The South and the West tended to support income taxes because their residents were generally less prosperous, more agricultural and more sensitive to fluctuations in commodity prices. A sharp rise in the cost of living between 1897 and 1913 greatly increased support for the idea of income taxes, including in the urban Northeast. A growing number of Republicans also began supporting the idea, notably Theodore Roosevelt and the \"Insurgent\" Republicans (who would go on to form the Progressive Party). These Republicans were driven mainly by a fear of the increasingly large and sophisticated military forces of Japan, Britain and the European powers, their own imperial ambitions, and the perceived need to defend American merchant ships. Moreover, these progressive Republicans were convinced that central governments could play a positive role in national economies. A bigger government and a bigger military, they argued, required a correspondingly larger and steadier source of revenue to support it.\nOpposition to the Sixteenth Amendment was led by establishment Republicans because of their close ties to wealthy industrialists, although not even they were uniformly opposed to the general idea of a permanent income tax. In 1910, New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes, shortly before becoming a Supreme Court Justice, spoke out against the income tax amendment. Hughes supported the idea of a federal income tax, but believed the words \"from whatever source derived\" in the proposed amendment implied that the federal government would have the power to tax state and municipal bonds. He believed this would excessively centralize governmental power and \"would make it impossible for the state to keep any property\".\nBetween 1909 and 1913, several conditions favored passage of the Sixteenth Amendment. Inflation was high and many blamed federal tariffs for the rising prices. The Republican Party was divided and weakened by the loss of Roosevelt and the Insurgents who joined the Progressive Party, a problem that blunted opposition even in the Northeast. In 1912, the Democrats won the presidency and control of both houses of Congress. The country was generally in a left-leaning mood, with a member of the Socialist Party winning a seat in the U.S. House in 1910 and the party's presidential candidate polling six percent of the popular vote in 1912.\nThree advocates of a federal income tax ran in the presidential election of 1912. On February 25, 1913, Secretary of State Philander Knox proclaimed that the amendment had been ratified by three-fourths of the states and so had become part of the Constitution. The Revenue Act of 1913, which greatly lowered tariffs and implemented a federal income tax, was enacted shortly after the Sixteenth Amendment was ratified.\nRatification.\nAccording to the United States Government Publishing Office, the following states ratified the amendment:\nRatification (by the requisite 36 states) was completed on February 3, 1913, with the ratification by Delaware. The amendment was subsequently ratified by the following states, bringing the total number of ratifying states to forty-two of the forty-eight then existing:\nThe legislatures of the following states rejected the amendment without ever subsequently ratifying it:\nThe legislatures of the following states never considered the proposed amendment:\nCase law.\nThe federal courts' interpretations of the Sixteenth Amendment have changed considerably over time and there have been many disputes about the applicability of the amendment.\nThe \"Brushaber\" case.\nIn \"Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad\", 240 U.S. https:// (1916), the Supreme Court ruled that (1) the Sixteenth Amendment removes the \"Pollock\" requirement that certain income taxes (such as taxes on income \"derived from real property\" that were the subject of the \"Pollock\" decision), be apportioned among the states according to population; (2) the federal income tax statute does not violate the Fifth Amendment's prohibition against the government taking property without due process of law; (3) the federal income tax statute does not violate the Article I, Section 8, Clause1 requirement that excises, also known as indirect taxes, be imposed with geographical uniformity.\nThe \"Kerbaugh-Empire Co.\" case.\nIn \"Bowers v. Kerbaugh-Empire Co.\", 271 U.S. https:// (1926), the Supreme Court, through Justice Pierce Butler, stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It was not the purpose or the effect of that amendment to bring any new subject within the taxing power. Congress already had the power to tax all incomes. But taxes on incomes from some sources had been held to be \"direct taxes\" within the meaning of the constitutional requirement as to apportionment. [citations omitted] The Amendment relieved from that requirement and obliterated the distinction in that respect between taxes on income that are direct taxes and those that are not, and so put on the same basis all incomes \"from whatever source derived\". [citations omitted] \"Income\" has been taken to mean the same thing as used in the Corporation Excise Tax of 1909 (36 Stat. 112), in the Sixteenth Amendment, and in the various revenue acts subsequently passed. [citations omitted] After full consideration, this court declared that income may be defined as gain derived from capital, from labor, or from both combined, including profit gained through sale or conversion of capital.\nThe \"Glenshaw Glass\" case.\nIn \"Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co.\", 348 U.S. https:// (1955), the Supreme Court laid out what has become the modern understanding of what constitutes \"gross income\" to which the Sixteenth Amendment applies, declaring that income taxes could be levied on \"accessions to wealth, clearly realized, and over which the taxpayers have complete dominion\". Under this definition, \"any\" increase in wealth\u2014whether through wages, benefits, bonuses, sale of stock or other property at a profit, bets won, lucky finds, awards of punitive damages in a lawsuit, qui tam actions\u2014are all within the definition of income, unless the Congress makes a specific exemption, as it has for items such as life insurance proceeds received by reason of the death of the insured party, gifts, bequests, devises and inheritances, and certain scholarships.\nIncome taxation of wages, etc..\nFederal courts have ruled that the Sixteenth Amendment allows a direct tax on \"wages, salaries, commissions, etc. without apportionment\".\nThe \"Penn Mutual\" case.\nAlthough the Sixteenth Amendment is often cited as the \"source\" of the congressional power to tax incomes, at least one court has reiterated the point made in \"Brushaber\" and other cases that the Sixteenth Amendment itself did not grant the Congress the power to tax incomes, a power the Congress had since 1789, but only removed the possible requirement that any income tax be apportioned among the states according to their respective populations. In \"Penn Mutual Indemnity\", the United States Tax Court stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit agreed with the Tax Court, stating:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It did not take a constitutional amendment to entitle the United States to impose an income tax. Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co., 157 U. S. 429, 158 U. S. 601 (1895), only held that a tax on the income derived from real or personal property was so close to a tax on that property that it could not be imposed without apportionment. The Sixteenth Amendment removed that barrier. Indeed, the requirement for apportionment is pretty strictly limited to taxes on real and personal property and capitation taxes.\nIt is not necessary to uphold the validity of the tax imposed by the United States that the tax itself bear an accurate label. Indeed, the tax upon the distillation of spirits, imposed very early by federal authority, now reads and has read in terms of a tax upon the spirits themselves, yet the validity of this imposition has been upheld for a very great many years.\nIt could well be argued that the tax involved here [an income tax] is an \"excise tax\" based upon the receipt of money by the taxpayer. It certainly is not a tax on property and it certainly is not a capitation tax; therefore, it need not be apportioned. We do not think it profitable, however, to make the label as precise as that required under the Food and Drug Act. Congress has the power to impose taxes generally, and if the particular imposition does not run afoul of any constitutional restrictions then the tax is lawful, call it what you will.\nThe \"Murphy\" case.\nOn December 22, 2006, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated its unanimous decision (of August 2006) in \"Murphy v. Internal Revenue Service and United States\". In an unrelated matter, the court had also granted the government's motion to dismiss Murphy's suit against the Internal Revenue Service. Under federal sovereign immunity, a taxpayer may sue the federal government, but not a government agency, officer, or employee (with some exceptions). The Court ruled:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAn exception to federal sovereign immunity is in the United States Tax Court, in which a taxpayer may sue the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The original three-judge panel then agreed to rehear the case itself. In its original decision, the Court had ruled that 26 U.S.C.\u00a0https:// was unconstitutional under the Sixteenth Amendment to the extent that the statute purported to tax, as income, a recovery for a nonphysical personal injury for mental distress and loss of reputation not received in lieu of taxable income such as lost wages or earnings.\nBecause the August 2006 opinion was vacated, the Court of Appeals did not hear the case \"en banc\".\nOn July 3, 2007, the Court (through the original three-judge panel) ruled (1) that the taxpayer's compensation was received on account of a nonphysical injury or sickness; (2) that gross income under section 61 of the Internal Revenue Code does include compensatory damages for nonphysical injuries, even if the award is not an \"accession to wealth\", (3) that the income tax imposed on an award for nonphysical injuries is an indirect tax, regardless of whether the recovery is restoration of \"human capital\", and therefore the tax does not violate the constitutional requirement of Article I, Section 9, Clause 4, that capitations or other direct taxes must be laid among the states only in proportion to the population; (4) that the income tax imposed on an award for nonphysical injuries does not violate the constitutional requirement of Article I, Section 8, Clause 1, that all duties, imposts and excises be uniform throughout the United States; (5) that under the doctrine of sovereign immunity, the Internal Revenue Service may not be sued in its own name.\nThe Court stated that \"[a]lthough the 'Congress cannot make a thing income which is not so in fact'... it can \"label\" a thing income and tax it, so long as it acts within its constitutional authority, which includes not only the Sixteenth Amendment but also Article I, Sections 8 and9.\" The court ruled that Ms. Murphy was not entitled to the tax refund she claimed, and that the personal injury award she received was \"within the reach of the Congressional power to tax under Article I, Section8 of the Constitution\" even if the award was \"not income within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment\". See also the \"Penn Mutual\" case cited above.\nOn April 21, 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the decision by the Court of Appeals.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31669", "revid": "42924606", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31669", "title": "Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution", "text": "1913 amendment establishing the direct election of senators\nThe Seventeenth Amendment (Amendment XVII) to the United States Constitution established the direct election of United States senators in each state. The amendment supersedes , Clauses 1 and2 of the Constitution, under which senators were appointed by state legislatures. It also alters the procedure for filling vacancies in the Senate, allowing for state legislatures to permit their governors to make temporary appointments until a special election can be held.\nThe amendment was proposed by the 62nd Congress in 1912 and became part of the Constitution upon ratification by three-quarters (36) of the state legislatures: on April 8, 1913. Sitting senators were not affected until their existing terms expired. The transition began with two special elections in Georgia and in Maryland, then in earnest with the November 1914 election; it was complete on March 4, 1919, when the senators chosen by the November 1918 election took office.\nText.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, elected by the people thereof, for six years; and each Senator shall have one vote. The electors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislatures.\nWhen vacancies happen in the representation of any State in the Senate, the executive authority of such State shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies: Provided, That the legislature of any State may empower the executive thereof to make temporary appointments until the people fill the vacancies by election as the legislature may direct.\nThis amendment shall not be so construed as to affect the election or term of any Senator chosen before it becomes valid as part of the Constitution.\nBackground.\nOriginal composition.\nOriginally, under , Clauses 1 and2 of the Constitution, each state legislature chose its state's senators for a six-year term. Each state, regardless of size, is entitled to two senators as part of the Connecticut Compromise between the small and large states. This contrasted with the House of Representatives, a body elected by popular vote, and was described as an uncontroversial decision; at the time, James Wilson was the sole advocate of popularly electing the Senate, but his proposal was defeated 10\u20131. There were many advantages to the original method of electing senators. Prior to the Constitution, a federal body was one where states effectively formed nothing more than permanent treaties, with citizens retaining their loyalty to their original state. However, under the new Constitution, the federal government was granted substantially more power than before. Having the state legislatures elect the senators reassured anti-federalists that there would be some protection against the federal government's swallowing up states and their powers, and providing a check on the power of the federal government.\nAdditionally, the longer terms and avoidance of popular election turned the Senate into a body that could counter the populism of the House. While the representatives operated in a two-year direct election cycle, making them frequently accountable to their constituents, the senators could afford to \"take a more detached view of issues coming before Congress\". State legislatures retained the theoretical right to \"instruct\" their senators to vote for or against proposals, thus giving the states both direct and indirect representation in the federal government. The Senate was part of a formal bicameralism, with the members of the Senate and House responsible to completely distinct constituencies; this helped defeat the problem of the federal government being subject to \"special interests\". Members of the Constitutional Convention considered the Senate to be parallel to the British House of Lords as an \"upper house\", containing the \"better men\" of society, but different as they would be conscientiously chosen by the upper houses of state legislatures for fixed terms, and not merely inherited for life. It was hoped they would provide abler deliberation and greater stability than the House of Representatives due to the senators' status.\nIssues.\nThose in favor of popular elections for senators believed two primary problems were caused by the original provisions: legislative corruption and electoral deadlocks. There was a sense that senatorial elections were \"bought and sold\", changing hands for favors and sums of money rather than because of the competence of the candidate. Between 1857 and 1900, the Senate investigated three elections over corruption. In 1900, for example, William A. Clark resigned after a Senate committee concluded that he had bought votes in the Montana legislature. But conservative analysts Jay Bybee and Todd Zywicki say this concern was largely unfounded; there was a \"dearth of hard information\" on the subject. In more than a century of legislative elections of U.S. senators, only ten cases were contested for allegations of impropriety.\nElectoral deadlocks were another issue. Because state legislatures were charged with deciding whom to appoint as senators, the system relied on their ability to agree. Some states could not, and thus delayed sending senators to Congress; in a few cases, the system broke down to the point where states completely lacked representation in the Senate. Deadlocks started to become an issue in the 1850s, with a deadlocked Indiana legislature allowing a Senate seat to sit vacant for two years. The tipping point came in 1865 with the election of John P. Stockton (D-NJ), which happened after the New Jersey legislature changed its rules regarding the definition of a quorum and was thus by plurality instead of by absolute majority.\nIn 1866, Congress acted to standardize a two-step process for Senate elections. In the first step, each chamber of the state legislature would meet separately to vote. The following day, the chambers would meet in \"joint assembly\" to assess the results, and if a majority in both chambers had voted for the same person, they would be elected. If not, the joint assembly would vote for a senator, with each member receiving a vote. If no person received a majority, the joint assembly was required to keep convening every day to take at least one vote until a senator was elected. Nevertheless, between 1891 and 1905, 46 elections were deadlocked across 20 states; in one extreme example, a Senate seat for Delaware went unfilled from 1899 until 1903. The business of holding elections also caused great disruption in the state legislatures, with a full third of the Oregon House of Representatives choosing not to swear the oath of office in 1897 due to a dispute over an open Senate seat. The result was that Oregon's legislature was unable to pass legislation that year.\nZywicki again argues that this was not a serious issue. Deadlocks were a problem, but they were the exception rather than the norm; many legislatures did not deadlock over elections at all. Most of those that did in the 19th century were the newly admitted western states, which suffered from \"inexperienced legislatures and weak party discipline... as western legislatures gained experience, deadlocks became less frequent.\" While Utah suffered from deadlocks in 1897 and 1899, they became what Zywicki refers to as \"a good teaching experience\", and Utah never again failed to elect senators. Another concern was that when deadlocks occurred, state legislatures were unable to conduct their other normal business; James Christian Ure, writing in the \"South Texas Law Review\", notes that this did not in fact occur. In a deadlock situation, state legislatures would deal with the matter by holding \"one vote at the beginning of the day\u2014then the legislators would continue with their normal affairs\".\nEventually, legislative elections held in a state's Senate election years were perceived to have become so dominated by the business of picking senators that the state's choice for senator distracted the electorate from all other pertinent issues. Senator John H. Mitchell noted that the Senate became the \"vital issue\" in all legislative campaigns, with the policy stances and qualifications of state legislative candidates ignored by voters who were more interested in the indirect Senate election. To remedy this, some state legislatures created \"advisory elections\" that served as de facto general elections, allowing legislative campaigns to focus on local issues.\nCalls for reform.\nCalls for a constitutional amendment regarding Senate elections started in the early 19th century, with Henry R. Storrs in 1826 proposing an amendment to provide for popular election. Similar amendments were introduced in 1829 and 1855, with the \"most prominent\" proponent being Andrew Johnson, who raised the issue in 1868 and considered the idea's merits \"so palpable\" that no additional explanation was necessary. As noted above, in the 1860s, there was a major congressional dispute over the issue, with the House and Senate voting to veto the appointment of John P. Stockton to the Senate due to his approval by a plurality of the New Jersey Legislature rather than a majority. In reaction, the Congress passed a bill in July 1866 that required state legislatures to elect senators by an absolute majority.\nBy the 1890s, support for the introduction of direct election for the Senate had substantially increased, and reformers worked on two fronts. On the first front, the Populist Party incorporated the direct election of senators into its Omaha Platform, adopted in 1892. In 1908, Oregon passed the first law basing the selection of U.S. senators on a popular vote. Oregon was soon followed by Nebraska. Proponents for popular election noted that ten states already had non-binding primaries for Senate candidates, in which the candidates would be voted on by the public, effectively serving as advisory referendums instructing state legislatures how to vote; reformers campaigned for more states to introduce a similar method.\nWilliam Randolph Hearst opened a nationwide popular readership for direct election of U.S. senators in a 1906 series of articles using flamboyant language attacking \"The Treason of the Senate\" in his \"Cosmopolitan\" magazine. David Graham Philips, a muckraker, described Nelson Aldrich of Rhode Island as the principal \"traitor\" among the \"scurvy lot\" in control of the Senate by theft, perjury, and bribes corrupting the state legislatures to gain election to the Senate. A few state legislatures began to petition the Congress for direct election of senators. By 1893, the House had the two-thirds vote for just such an amendment. However, when the joint resolution reached the Senate, it failed from neglect, as it did again in 1900, 1904 and 1908; each time the House approved the appropriate resolution, and each time it died in the Senate.\nOn the second national legislative front, reformers worked toward a constitutional amendment, which was strongly supported in the House of Representatives but initially opposed by the Senate. Bybee notes that the state legislatures, which would lose power if the reforms went through, were supportive of the campaign. By 1910, 31 state legislatures had passed resolutions calling for a constitutional amendment allowing direct election, and in the same year ten Republican senators who were opposed to reform were forced out of their seats, acting as a \"wake-up call to the Senate\".\nReformers included William Jennings Bryan, while opponents counted respected figures such as Elihu Root and George Frisbie Hoar among their number; Root cared so strongly about the issue that after the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment he refused to stand for re\u2011election to the Senate. Bryan and the reformers argued for popular election through highlighting flaws they saw within the existing system, specifically corruption and electoral deadlocks, and through arousing populist sentiment. Most important was the populist argument; that there was a need to \"Awaken, in the senators... a more acute sense of responsibility to the people\", which it was felt they lacked; election through state legislatures was seen as an anachronism that was out of step with the wishes of the American people, and one that had led to the Senate becoming \"a sort of aristocratic body\u2014too far removed from the people, beyond their reach, and with no special interest in their welfare\". The settlement of the West and continuing absorption of hundreds of thousands of immigrants expanded the sense of \"the people\".\nHoar replied that \"the people\" were both a less permanent and a less trusted body than state legislatures, and moving the responsibility for the election of senators to them would see it passing into the hands of a body that \"[lasted] but a day\" before changing. Other counterarguments were that renowned senators could not have been elected directly and that, since a large number of senators had experience in the House (which was already directly elected), a constitutional amendment would be pointless. The reform was considered by opponents to threaten the rights and independence of the states, who were \"sovereign, entitled... to have a separate branch of Congress... to which they could send their ambassadors.\" This was countered by the argument that a change in the mode in which senators were elected would not change their responsibilities.\nThe Senate freshman class of 1910 brought new hope to the reformers. Fourteen of the thirty newly elected senators had been elected through party primaries, which amounted to popular choice in their states. More than half of the states had some form of primary selection for the Senate. The Senate finally joined the House to submit the Seventeenth Amendment to the states for ratification, nearly ninety years after it first was presented to the Senate in 1826.\nBy 1912, 239 political parties at both the state and national level had pledged some form of direct election, and 33 states had introduced the use of direct primaries. Twenty-seven states had called for a constitutional convention on the subject, with 31 states needed to reach the threshold; Arizona and New Mexico each achieved statehood that year (bringing the total number of states to 48), and were expected to support the motion. Alabama and Wyoming, already states, had passed resolutions in favor of a convention without formally calling for one.\nProposal and ratification.\nProposal in Congress.\nIn 1911, the House of Representatives passed House Joint Resolution 39 proposing a constitutional amendment for direct election of senators. The original resolution passed by the House contained the following clause:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The times, places, and manner of holding elections for Senators shall be as prescribed in each State by the legislature thereof.\nThis so-called \"race rider\" clause would have strengthened the powers of states over senatorial elections and weakened those of Congress by overriding Congress's power to override state laws affecting the manner of senatorial elections.\nSince the 1890s, nearly all blacks in the South, and many poor whites, had been disenfranchised by new provisions in state constitutions that were discriminatory in practice. This meant that these millions of people had no political representation, and most of the South was \"de facto\" one-party states. The \"rider\" was intended to enable these states to continue these practices, protected from any federal interference.\nWhen the resolution came before the Senate, Senator Joseph L. Bristow (R-KS) proposed an amendment which eliminated the rider. This amendment was approved by 45 votes to 44 after Vice President James S. Sherman cast a tie-breaking \"yea\" vote.\nThe amended resolution was then adopted by a vote of 64 to 24, with four not voting. Nearly a year later, the House accepted the change. The conference report that would become the Seventeenth Amendment was approved by the Senate in a 42 to 36 vote on April 12, 1912, and by the House 238 to 39, with 110 not voting on May 13, 1912.\nRatification by the states.\nHaving been passed by Congress, the amendment was sent to the states for ratification and was ratified by:\nThe Utah legislature rejected the amendment on February 26, 1913. No action on the amendment has been completed by Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, South Carolina, or Virginia. Alaska and Hawaii were not yet states at the time of the amendment's proposal, and therefore ratified the amendment along with the rest of the Constitution as part of joining the Union in 1959.\nEffect.\nThe Seventeenth Amendment altered the process for electing United States senators and changed the way vacancies would be filled. Originally, the Constitution required state legislatures to fill Senate vacancies.\nAccording to Judge Bybee, the Seventeenth Amendment had a dramatic impact on the political composition of the U.S. Senate. Before the Supreme Court required \"one man, one vote\" in \"Reynolds v. Sims\" (1964), malapportionment of state legislatures was common. For example, rural counties and cities could be given \"equal weight\" in the state legislatures, enabling one rural vote to equal 200 city votes. The malapportioned state legislatures would have given the Republicans control of the Senate in the 1916 Senate elections. With direct election, each vote represented equally, the Democrats held their stronghold in the South and offset net Republican gains in the Northeast by picking up new seats in New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming, retaining control of the Senate. Similarly, Bybee believes the Republican Revolution of 1994 would not have happened without direct election of Senators; instead, the Democrats would have controlled 70 seats in the Senate to the Republicans' 30.\nThe reputation of corrupt and arbitrary state legislatures continued to decline as the Senate joined the House of Representatives in implementing popular reforms. Bybee has argued that the amendment led to complete \"ignominy\" for state legislatures without the buttress of a state-based check on Congress. In the decades following the Seventeenth Amendment, the federal government was enabled to enact progressive measures. However, Schleiches argues that the separation of state legislatures and the Senate had a beneficial effect on the states, as it led state legislative campaigns to focus on local rather than national issues.\nNew Deal legislation is another example of expanding federal regulation overruling the state legislatures promoting their local state interests in coal, oil, corn and cotton. Ure agrees, saying that not only is each senator now free to ignore his state's interests, senators \"have incentive to use their advice-and-consent powers to install Supreme Court justices who are inclined to increase federal power at the expense of state sovereignty\". Over the first half of the 20th century, with a popularly elected Senate confirming nominations, both Republican and Democratic, the Supreme Court began to apply the Bill of Rights to the states, overturning state laws whenever they harmed individual state citizens. It aimed to limit the influence of the wealthy.\nFilling vacancies.\nThe Seventeenth Amendment requires a governor to call a special election to fill vacancies in the Senate. It also allows a state's legislature to permit its governor to make temporary appointments, which last until a special election is held to fill the vacancy. Currently, all but four states (North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin) permit such appointments. The Constitution does not set out how the temporary appointee is to be selected.\nFirst direct elections to the Senate.\nOklahoma, admitted to statehood in 1907, chose a senator by legislative election three times: twice in 1907, when admitted, and once in 1908. In 1912, Oklahoma reelected Robert Owen by advisory popular vote.\nOregon held primaries in 1908 in which the parties would run candidates for that position, and the state legislature pledged to choose the winner as the new senator.\nNew Mexico, admitted to statehood in 1912, chose only its first two senators legislatively. Arizona, admitted to statehood in 1912, chose its first two senators by advisory popular vote. Alaska, and Hawaii, admitted to statehood in 1959, have never chosen a U.S. senator legislatively.\nThe first election subject to the Seventeenth Amendment was a late election in Georgia held June 15, 1913. Augustus Octavius Bacon was however unopposed.\nThe first direct elections to the Senate following the Seventeenth Amendment being adopted were:\nCourt cases and interpretation controversies.\nIn \"Trinsey v. Pennsylvania\" (1991), the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit was faced with a situation where, following the death of Senator John Heinz of Pennsylvania, Governor Bob Casey had provided for a replacement and for a special election that did not include a primary. A voter and prospective candidate, John S. Trinsey Jr., argued that the lack of a primary violated the Seventeenth Amendment and his right to vote under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Third Circuit rejected these arguments, ruling that the Seventeenth Amendment does not require primaries.\nAnother subject of analysis is whether statutes restricting the authority of governors to appoint temporary replacements are constitutional. Vikram Amar, writing in the \"Hastings Constitutional Law Quarterly\", claims Wyoming's requirement that its governor fill a senatorial vacancy by nominating a person of the same party as the person who vacated that seat violates the Seventeenth Amendment. This is based on the text of the Seventeenth Amendment, which states that \"the legislature of any state may empower the executive thereof to make temporary appointments\". The amendment only empowers the legislature to delegate the authority to the governor and, once that authority has been delegated, does not permit the legislature to intervene. The authority is to decide whether the governor shall have the power to appoint temporary senators, not whom the governor may appoint. Sanford Levinson, in his rebuttal to Amar, argues that rather than engaging in a textual interpretation, those examining the meaning of constitutional provisions should interpret them in the fashion that provides the most benefit, and that legislatures' being able to restrict gubernatorial appointment authority provides a substantial benefit to the states.\nReform and repeal efforts.\nNotwithstanding controversies over the effects of the Seventeenth Amendment, advocates have emerged to reform or repeal the amendment. At the beginning of President Barack Obama's administration in 2009, four sitting Democratic senators left the Senate for executive branch positions: Obama himself (President), Joe Biden (Vice President), Hillary Clinton (Secretary of State), and Ken Salazar (Secretary of the Interior). Controversies developed about the successor appointments made by Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich and New York governor David Paterson. New interest was aroused in abolishing the provision for the Senate appointment by the governor. Accordingly, Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin and Representative David Dreier of California proposed an amendment to remove this power; senators John McCain and Dick Durbin became co-sponsors, as did Representative John Conyers.\nSome members of the Tea Party movement argued for repealing the Seventeenth Amendment entirely, claiming it would protect states' rights and reduce the power of the federal government. On March 2, 2016, the Utah legislature approved Senate Joint Resolution No.2 asking Congress to offer an amendment to the United States Constitution that would repeal the Seventeenth Amendment. As of 2025[ [update]], no other states had supported such an amendment, and some politicians who had made statements in favor of repealing the amendment had subsequently reversed their position on this.\nOn July 28, 2017, after Republican senators John McCain, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski voted against the Health Care Freedom Act, which would have repealed the Affordable Care Act, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee endorsed the repeal of the Seventeenth Amendment. He claimed that senators chosen by state legislatures \"will work for their states and respect [the Tenth Amendment]\", and also that direct election of senators is a major cause of the \"swamp\".\nIn September 2020, Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska endorsed the repeal of the Seventeenth Amendment in a \"Wall Street Journal\" opinion piece.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The amendment was the culmination of a decades-long movement for women's suffrage in the United States, at both the state and national levels, and was part of the worldwide movement towards women's suffrage and part of the wider women's rights movement. The first women's suffrage amendment was introduced in Congress in 1878. However, a suffrage amendment did not pass the House of Representatives until May 21, 1919, which was quickly followed by the Senate, on June 4, 1919. It was then submitted to the states for ratification, achieving the requisite 36 ratifications to secure adoption, and thereby went into effect, on August 18, 1920. The Nineteenth Amendment's adoption was certified on August 26, 1920.\nBefore 1776, women had a vote in several of the colonies in what would become the United States, but by 1807 every state constitution had denied women even limited suffrage. Organizations supporting women's rights became more active in the mid-19th century and, in 1848, the Seneca Falls convention adopted the Declaration of Sentiments, which called for equality between the sexes and included a resolution urging women to secure the vote. Pro-suffrage organizations used a variety of tactics including legal arguments that relied on existing amendments. After those arguments were struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court, suffrage organizations, with activists like Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, called for a new constitutional amendment guaranteeing women the same right to vote possessed by men.\nBy the late 19th century, new states and territories, particularly in the West, began to grant women the right to vote. In 1878, a suffrage proposal that would eventually become the Nineteenth Amendment was introduced to Congress, but was rejected in 1887. In the 1890s, suffrage organizations focused on a national amendment while still working at state and local levels. Lucy Burns and Alice Paul emerged as important leaders whose different strategies helped move the Nineteenth Amendment forward. Entry of the United States into World War I helped to shift public perception of women's suffrage. The National American Woman Suffrage Association, led by Carrie Chapman Catt, supported the war effort, making the case that women should be rewarded with enfranchisement for their patriotic wartime service. The National Woman's Party staged marches, demonstrations, and hunger strikes while pointing out the contradictions of fighting abroad for democracy while limiting it at home by denying women the right to vote. The work of both organizations swayed public opinion, prompting President Woodrow Wilson to announce his support of the suffrage amendment in 1918. It passed in 1919 and was adopted in 1920, withstanding two legal challenges, \"Leser v. Garnett\" and \"Fairchild v. Hughes\".\nThe Nineteenth Amendment enfranchised 26\u00a0million American women in time for the 1920 U.S. presidential election, but the powerful women's voting bloc that many politicians feared failed to fully materialize until decades later. Additionally, the Nineteenth Amendment failed to fully enfranchise African American, Asian American, Hispanic American, and Native American women (see ). Shortly after the amendment's adoption, Alice Paul and the National Woman's Party began work on the Equal Rights Amendment, which they believed was a necessary additional step towards equality.\nText.\nThe Nineteenth Amendment provides:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.\nCongress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.\nBackground.\nEarly woman suffrage efforts (1776\u20131865).\nThe United States Constitution, adopted in 1789, left the boundaries of suffrage undefined. The only directly elected body created under the original Constitution was the U.S. House of Representatives, for which voter qualifications were explicitly delegated to the individual states. While women had the right to vote in several of the pre-revolutionary colonies in what would become the United States, after 1776, with the exception of New Jersey, all states adopted constitutions that denied voting rights to women. New Jersey's constitution initially granted suffrage to property-holding residents, including single and married women, but the state rescinded women's voting rights in 1807 and did not restore them until New Jersey ratified the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920.\nWhile scattered movements and organizations dedicated to women's rights existed previously, the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention in New York is traditionally held as the start of the American women's rights movement. Attended by nearly 300 women and men, the convention was designed to \"discuss the social, civil, and religious rights of women\", and culminated in the adoption of the Declaration of Sentiments. Signed by 68 women and 32 men, the ninth of the document's twelve resolved clauses reads, \"Resolved, That it is the duty of the women of this country to secure to themselves their sacred right to the elective franchise.\" Conveners Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton became key early leaders in the U.S. women's suffrage movement, often referred to at the time as the \"woman suffrage movement\". Mott's support of women's suffrage stemmed from a summer spent with the Seneca Nation, one of the six tribes in the Iroquois Confederacy, where women had significant political power, including the right to choose and remove chiefs and veto acts of war.\nActivism addressing federal women's suffrage was minimal during the Civil War. In 1865, at the conclusion of the war, a \"Petition for Universal Suffrage\", signed by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, among others, called for a national constitutional amendment to \"prohibit the several states from disenfranchising any of their citizens on the ground of sex\". The campaign was the first national petition drive to feature woman suffrage among its demands. While suffrage bills were introduced into many state legislatures during this period, they were generally disregarded and few came to a vote.\nReconstruction Amendments and woman suffrage (1865\u20131877).\nThe women's suffrage movement, delayed by the American Civil War, resumed activities during the Reconstruction era (1865\u20131877). Two rival suffrage organizations formed in 1869: the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA), led by suffrage leaders Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, and the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA), led by Lucy Stone. The NWSA's main effort was lobbying Congress for a women's suffrage amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The AWSA generally focused on a long-term effort of state campaigns to achieve women's suffrage on a state-by-state basis.\nDuring the Reconstruction era, women's rights leaders advocated for inclusion of universal suffrage as a civil right in the Reconstruction Amendments (the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments). Some unsuccessfully argued that the Fifteenth Amendment, which prohibited denying voting rights \"on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude\", implied suffrage for women. Despite their efforts, these amendments did not enfranchise women. Section2 of the Fourteenth Amendment explicitly discriminated between men and women by only penalizing states which deprived adult male citizens of the vote.\nThe NWSA attempted several unsuccessful court challenges in the mid-1870s. Their legal argument, known as the \"New Departure\" strategy, contended that the Fourteenth Amendment (granting universal citizenship) and Fifteenth Amendment (granting the vote irrespective of race) together guaranteed voting rights to women. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected this argument. In \"Bradwell v. Illinois\" the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Supreme Court of Illinois's refusal to grant Myra Bradwell a license to practice law was not a violation of the U.S. Constitution and refused to extend federal authority in support of women's citizenship rights. In \"Minor v. Happersett\" the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not provide voting rights to U.S. citizens; it only guaranteed additional protection of privileges to citizens who already had them. If a state constitution limited suffrage to male citizens of the United States, then women in that state did not have voting rights. After U.S. Supreme Court decisions between 1873 and 1875 denied voting rights to women in connection with the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, suffrage groups shifted their efforts to advocating for a new constitutional amendment.\nContinued settlement of the western frontier, along with the establishment of territorial constitutions, allowed the women's suffrage issue to be raised as the western territories progressed toward statehood. Through the activism of suffrage organizations and independent political parties, women's suffrage was included in the constitutions of Wyoming Territory (1869) and Utah Territory (1870). Women's suffrage in Utah was revoked in 1887, when Congress passed the Edmunds-Tucker Act in 1887 that also prohibited polygamy; it was not restored in Utah until it achieved statehood in 1896.\nPost-Reconstruction (1878\u20131910).\nExisting state legislatures in the West, as well as those east of the Mississippi River, began to consider suffrage bills in the 1870s and 1880s. Several held voter referendums, but they were unsuccessful until the suffrage movement was revived in the 1890s. Full women's suffrage continued in Wyoming after it became a state in 1890. Colorado granted partial voting rights that allowed women to vote in school board elections in 1893 and Idaho granted women suffrage in 1896. Beginning with Washington in 1910, seven more western states passed women's suffrage legislation, including California in 1911, Oregon, Arizona, and Kansas in 1912, Alaska Territory in 1913, and Montana and Nevada in 1914. All states that were successful in securing full voting rights for women before 1920 were located in the West.\nA federal amendment intended to grant women the right to vote was introduced in the U.S. Senate for the first time in 1878 by Aaron A. Sargent, a Senator from California who was a women's suffrage advocate. Stanton and other women testified before the Senate in support of the amendment. The proposal sat in a committee until it was considered by the full Senate and rejected in a 16-to-34 vote in 1887. An amendment proposed in 1888 in the U.S. House of Representatives called for limited suffrage for women who were spinsters or widows who owned property.\nBy the 1890s, suffrage leaders began to recognize the need to broaden their base of support to achieve success in passing suffrage legislation at the national, state, and local levels. While western women, state suffrage organizations, and the AWSA concentrated on securing women's voting rights for specific states, efforts at the national level persisted through a strategy of congressional testimony, petitioning, and lobbying. After the AWSA and NWSA merged in 1890 to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), the group directed its efforts to win state-level support for suffrage. Suffragists had to campaign publicly for the vote in order to convince male voters, state legislators, and members of Congress that American women wanted to be enfranchised and that women voters would benefit American society. Suffrage supporters also had to convince American women, many of whom were indifferent to the issue, that suffrage was something they wanted. Apathy among women was an ongoing obstacle that the suffragists had to overcome through organized grassroots efforts. Despite the suffragists' efforts, no state granted women suffrage between 1896 and 1910, and the NAWSA shifted its focus toward passage of a national constitutional amendment. Suffragists also continued to press for the right to vote in individual states and territories while retaining the goal of federal recognition.\nAfrican-American woman suffrage efforts.\nThousands of African-American women were active in the suffrage movement, addressing issues of race, gender, and class, as well as enfranchisement, often through the church but eventually through organizations devoted to specific causes. While white women sought the vote to gain an equal voice in the political process, African-American women often sought the vote as a means of racial uplift and as a way to effect change in the post-Reconstruction era. Notable African-American suffragists such as Mary Church Terrell, Sojourner Truth, Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, Fannie Barrier Williams, and Ida B. Wells-Barnett advocated for suffrage in tandem with civil rights for African-Americans.\nAs early as 1866, in Philadelphia, Margaretta Forten and Harriet Forten Purvis helped to found the Philadelphia Suffrage Association; Purvis would go on to serve on the executive committee of the American Equal Rights Association (AERA), an organization that supported suffrage for women and for African-American men. A national movement in support of suffrage for African-American women began in earnest with the rise of the black women's club movement. In 1896, club women belonging to various organizations promoting women's suffrage met in Washington, D.C. to form the National Association of Colored Women, of which Frances E.W. Harper, Josephine St. Pierre, Harriet Tubman, and Ida B. Wells-Barnett were founding members. Led by Mary Church Terrell, it was the largest federation of African-American women's clubs in the nation. After 1914 it became the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs.\nWhen the Fifteenth Amendment enfranchised African-American men, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony abandoned the AERA, which supported universal suffrage, to found the National Woman Suffrage Association in 1869, saying black men should not receive the vote before white women. In response, African-American suffragist Frances Ellen Watkins Harper and others joined the American Woman Suffrage Association, which supported suffrage for women and for black men. Mary Ann Shadd Cary, the second African-American woman to receive a degree from Howard University Law School, joined the National Woman Suffrage Association in 1878 when she delivered their convention's keynote address. Tensions between African-American and white suffragists persisted, even after the NWSA and AWSA merged to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association in 1890. By the early 1900s, white suffragists often adopted strategies designed to appease the Southern states at the expense of African-American women. At conventions in 1901 and 1903, in Atlanta and New Orleans, NAWSA prevented African Americans from attending. At the 1911 national NAWSA conference, Martha Gruening asked the organization to formally denounce white supremacy. NAWSA president Anna Howard Shaw refused, saying she was \"in favor of colored people voting\", but did not want to alienate others in the suffrage movement. Even NAWSA's more radical Congressional Committee, which would become the National Woman's Party, failed African-American women, most visibly by refusing to allow them to march in the nation's first suffrage parade in Washington, D.C. While the NAWSA directed Paul not to exclude African-American participants, 72 hours before the parade African-American women were directed to the back of the parade; Ida B. Wells defied these instructions and joined the Illinois unit, prompting telegrams of support.\nMary B. Talbert, a leader in both the NACW and NAACP, and Nannie Helen Burroughs, an educator and activist, contributed to an issue of the \"Crisis\", published by W. E. B. Du Bois in August 1915. They wrote passionately about African-American women's need for the vote. Burroughs, asked what women could do with the ballot, responded pointedly: \"What can she do without it?\"\nProposal and ratification.\nA new focus on a federal amendment.\nBy 1910, efforts to pursue a national amendment in the National American Woman Suffrage Association had fallen by the wayside under the leadership of President Anna Howard Shaw. Inspired by the militant efforts and national focus of suffragettes in the United Kingdom, Alice Paul and Lucy Burns revitalized the mostly dormant Congressional Committee to place renewed pressure on the federal government. Most significantly, they organized a women's suffrage parade in Washington, D.C. on March 3, 1913, the day before Woodrow Wilson's inauguration. The procession of more than 5,000 participants, the first of its kind, attracted a crowd of an estimated 500,000, as well as national media attention, but Wilson took no immediate action. Shortly after, frustrated with NAWSA leadership, Paul and Burns broke away to found the Congressional Union for Women Suffrage in April 1913 to continue their campaign in pressuring the federal government to take legislative action.\nTwo years later in 1915, Carrie Chapman Catt began her second presidency of NAWSA. Under her leadership, Catt steered the organization to focus on the passage of the federal amendment while simultaneously supporting women who wanted to pressure their states to pass suffrage legislation. The strategy, which she later called \"The Winning Plan\", had several goals: women in states that had already granted presidential suffrage (the right to vote for the President) would focus on passing a federal suffrage amendment; women who believed they could influence their state legislatures would focus on amending their state constitutions and Southern states would focus on gaining primary suffrage (the right to vote in state primaries). Simultaneously, the NAWSA worked to elect congressmen who supported suffrage for women. By 1915, NAWSA was a large, powerful organization, with 44 state chapters and more than two million members.\nIn March 1917, the Congressional Union joined with Women's Party of Western Voters to form the National Woman's Party (NWP), whose aggressive tactics included staging more radical acts of civil disobedience and controversial demonstrations to draw more attention to the women's suffrage issue.\nWomen's suffrage and World War I patriotism.\nWhen World War I started in 1914, women in eight states had already won the right to vote, but support for a federal amendment was still tepid. The war provided a new urgency to the fight for the vote. When the U.S. entered World War I, Catt made the controversial decision to support the war effort, despite the widespread pacifist sentiment of many of her colleagues and supporters. As women joined the labor force to replace men serving in the military and took visible positions as nurses, relief workers, and ambulance drivers to support the war effort, NAWSA organizers argued that women's sacrifices made them deserving of the vote. By contrast, the NWP used the war to point out the contradictions of fighting for democracy abroad while restricting it at home. In 1917, the NWP began picketing the White House to bring attention to the cause of women's suffrage.\nIn 1914 the constitutional amendment proposed by Sargent, which was nicknamed the \"Susan B. Anthony Amendment\", was once again considered by the Senate, where it was again rejected. In April 1917 the \"Anthony Amendment\", which eventually became the Nineteenth Amendment, was reintroduced in the House and Senate. Picketing NWP members, nicknamed the \"Silent Sentinels\", continued their protests on the sidewalks outside the White House. On July 4, 1917, police arrested 168 of the protesters, who were sent to prison in Lorton, Virginia. Some of these women, including Lucy Burns and Alice Paul, went on hunger strikes; some were force-fed while others were otherwise harshly treated by prison guards. The release of the women a few months later was largely due to increasing public pressure.\nFinal congressional challenges.\nIn 1918, President Wilson faced a difficult midterm election and would have to confront the issue of women's suffrage directly. Fifteen states had extended equal voting rights to women and, by this time, the President fully supported the federal amendment. A proposal brought before the House in January 1918 passed by only one vote. The vote was then carried into the Senate where Wilson made an appeal on the Senate floor, an unprecedented action at the time. In a short speech, the President tied women's right to vote directly to the war, asking, \"Shall we admit them only to a partnership of suffering and sacrifice and toil and not to a partnership of privilege and right?\" On September 30, 1918, the proposal fell two votes short of passage, prompting the NWP to direct campaigning against senators who had voted against the amendment.\nBetween January 1918 and June 1919, the House and Senate voted on the federal amendment five times. Each vote was extremely close and Southern Democrats continued to oppose giving women the vote. Suffragists pressured President Wilson to call a special session of Congress and he agreed to schedule one for May 19, 1919. On May 21, 1919, the amendment passed the House 304 to 89, with 42 votes more than was necessary. On June 4, 1919, it was brought before the Senate and, after Southern Democrats abandoned a filibuster, 36 Republican senators were joined by 20 Democrats to pass the amendment with 56 yeas, 25 nays, and 14 not voting. The final vote tally was:\nRatification.\nCarrie Chapman Catt and Alice Paul immediately mobilized members of the NAWSA and NWP to pressure states to ratify the amendment. Within a few days, the legislatures of Wisconsin, Illinois, and Michigan did so. It is arguable which State was considered first to ratify the amendment. While Illinois's legislature passed the legislation an hour prior to Wisconsin, Wisconsin's delegate, David James, arrived earlier and was presented with a statement establishing Wisconsin as the first to ratify.\nBy August 2, 1919, 14 states had approved ratification. In other states support proved more difficult to secure. Much of the opposition to the amendment came from Southern Democrats; only two former Confederate states (Texas and Arkansas) and three border states voted for ratification, with Kentucky and West Virginia not doing so until 1920. Alabama and Georgia were the first states to defeat ratification. The governor of Louisiana worked to organize 13 states to resist ratifying the amendment. The Maryland legislature refused to ratify the amendment and attempted to prevent other states from doing so. Carrie Catt began appealing to Western governors, encouraging them to act swiftly. By the end of 1919, a total of 22 states had ratified the amendment.\nResistance to ratification took many forms: anti-suffragists continued to say the amendment would never be approved by the November 1920 elections and that special sessions were a waste of time and effort. Other opponents to ratification filed lawsuits requiring the federal amendment to be approved by state referendums. By June 1920, after intense lobbying by both the NAWSA and the NWP, the amendment was ratified by 35 of the necessary 36 state legislatures. Ratification would be determined by Tennessee.\nIn the middle of July 1920, both opponents and supporters of the Anthony Amendment arrived in Nashville to lobby the General Assembly. Carrie Catt, representing the NAWSA, worked with state suffragist leaders, including Anne Dallas Dudley and Abby Crawford Milton. Sue Shelton White, a Tennessee native who had participated in protests at the White House and toured with the Prison Special, represented the NWP. Opposing them were the \"Antis\", in particular, Josephine Pearson, state president of the Southern Women's Rejection League of the Susan. B. Anthony Amendment, who had served as dean and chair of philosophy at Christian College in Columbia. Pearson was assisted by Anne Pleasant, president of the Louisiana Women's Rejection League and the wife of a former Louisiana governor. Especially in the South, the question of women's suffrage was closely tied to issues of race. While both white and black women worked toward women's suffrage, some white suffragists tried to appease southern states by arguing that votes for women could counter the black vote, strengthening white supremacy. For the anti-suffragists in the south (the \"Antis\"), the federal amendment was viewed as a \"Force Bill\", one that Congress could use to enforce voting provisions not only for women, but for African-American men who were still effectively disenfranchised even after passage of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. Carrie Catt warned suffrage leaders in Tennessee that the \"Anti-Suffs\" would rely on \"lies, innuendoes, and near truths\", raising the issue of race as a powerful factor in their arguments.\nPrior to the start of the General Assembly session on August 9, both supporters and opponents had lobbied members of the Tennessee Senate and House of Representatives. Though the Democratic governor of Tennessee, Albert H. Roberts, supported ratification, most lawmakers were still undecided. Anti-suffragists targeted members, meeting their trains as they arrived in Nashville to make their case. When the General Assembly convened on August 9, both supporters and opponents set up stations outside of chambers, handing out yellow roses to suffrage supporters and red roses to the \"Antis\". On August 12, the legislature held hearings on the suffrage proposal; the next day the Senate voted 24\u20135 in favor of ratification. As the House prepared to take up the issue of ratification on August 18, lobbying intensified. House Speaker Seth M. Walker attempted to table the ratification resolution, but was defeated twice with a vote of 48\u201348. The vote on the resolution would be close. Representative Harry Burn, a Republican, had voted to table the resolution both times. When the vote was held again, Burn voted yes. The 24-year-old said he supported women's suffrage as a \"moral right\", but had voted against it because he believed his constituents opposed it. In the final minutes before the vote, he received a note from his mother, urging him to vote yes. Rumors immediately circulated that Burn and other lawmakers had been bribed, but newspaper reporters found no evidence of this.\nThe same day ratification passed in the General Assembly, Speaker Walker filed a motion to reconsider. When it became clear he did not have enough votes to carry the motion, representatives opposing suffrage boarded a train, fleeing Nashville for Decatur, Alabama to block the House from taking action on the reconsideration motion by preventing a quorum. Thirty-seven legislators fled to Decatur, issuing a statement that ratifying the amendment would violate their oath to defend the state constitution. The ploy failed. Speaker Walker was unable to muster any additional votes in the allotted time. When the House reconvened to take the final procedural steps that would reaffirm ratification, Tennessee suffragists seized an opportunity to taunt the missing Anti delegates by sitting at their empty desks. When ratification was finally confirmed, a suffragist on the floor of the House rang a miniature Liberty Bell.\nOn August 18, 1920, Tennessee narrowly approved the Nineteenth Amendment, with 50 of 99 members of the Tennessee House of Representatives voting yes. This provided the final ratification necessary to add the amendment to the Constitution, making the United States the twenty-seventh country in the world to give women the right to vote. Upon signing the ratification certificate, the Governor of Tennessee sent it by registered mail to the U.S. Secretary of State Bainbridge Colby, whose office received it at 4:00\u00a0a.m. on August 26, 1920. Once certified as correct, Colby signed the Proclamation of the Women's Suffrage Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in the presence of his secretary only.\nRatification timeline.\nCongress proposed the Nineteenth Amendment on June 4, 1919, and the following states ratified the amendment.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe ratification process required 36 states, and completed with the approval by Tennessee. Though not necessary for adoption, the following states subsequently ratified the amendment. Some states did not call a legislative session to hold a vote until later, others rejected it when it was proposed and then reversed their decisions years later, with the last taking place in 1984.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nWith Mississippi's ratification in 1984, the amendment was now ratified by all states existing at the time of its adoption in 1920.\nLegal challenges.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court unanimously upheld the amendment's validity in \"Leser v. Garnett\". &lt;section begin=\"LvG\"/&gt;Maryland citizens Mary D. Randolph, \"'a colored female citizen' of 331 West Biddle Street\", and Cecilia Street Waters, \"a white woman, of 824 North Eutaw Street\", applied for and were granted registration as qualified Baltimore voters on October 12, 1920. To have their names removed from the list of qualified voters, Oscar Leser and others brought suit against the two women on the sole grounds that they were women, arguing that they were not eligible to vote because the Constitution of Maryland limited suffrage to men and the Maryland legislature had refused to vote to ratify the Nineteenth Amendment.&lt;section end=\"LvG\"/&gt; Two months before, on August 26, 1920, the federal government had proclaimed the amendment incorporated into the Constitution.\nLeser said the amendment \"destroyed State autonomy\" because it increased Maryland's electorate without the state's consent. The Supreme Court answered that the Nineteenth Amendment had similar wording to the Fifteenth Amendment, which had expanded state electorates without regard to race for more than fifty years by that time despite rejection by six states (including Maryland). Leser further argued that the state constitutions in some ratifying states did not allow their legislatures to ratify. The court replied that state ratification was a federal function granted under Article V of the U.S. Constitution and not subject to a state constitution's limitations. Finally, those bringing suit asserted the Nineteenth Amendment was not adopted because Tennessee and West Virginia violated their own rules of procedure. The court ruled that the point was moot because Connecticut and Vermont had subsequently ratified the amendment, providing a sufficient number of state ratifications to adopt the Nineteenth Amendment even without Tennessee and West Virginia. The court also ruled that Tennessee's and West Virginia's certifications of their state ratifications was binding and had been duly authenticated by their respective secretaries of state. As a result of the court's ruling, Randolph and Waters were permitted to become registered voters in Baltimore.\nAnother challenge to the Nineteenth Amendment's adoption was dismissed by the Supreme Court in \"Fairchild v. Hughes\", because the party bringing the suit, Charles S. Fairchild, came from a state that already allowed women to vote and so Fairchild lacked standing.\nEffects.\nWomen's voting behavior.\nAdoption of the Nineteenth Amendment enfranchised 26\u00a0million American women in time for the 1920 U.S. presidential election. Many legislators feared that a powerful women's bloc would emerge in American politics. This fear led to the passage of such laws as the Sheppard\u2013Towner Maternity and Infancy Protection Act of 1921, which expanded maternity care during the 1920s. Newly enfranchised women and women's groups prioritized a reform agenda rather than party loyalty and their first goal was the Sheppard-Towner Act. It was the first federal social security law and made a dramatic difference before it was allowed to lapse in 1929. Other efforts at the federal level in the early 1920s that related to women labor and women's citizenship rights included the establishment of a Women's Bureau in the U.S. Department of Labor in 1920 and passage of the Cable Act in 1922. After the U.S. presidential election in 1924, politicians realized the women's bloc they had feared did not actually exist and they did not need to cater to what they considered as \"women's issues\" after all. The eventual appearance of an American women's voting bloc has been tracked to various dates, depending on the source, from the 1950s to 1970. Around 1980, a nationwide gender gap in voting had emerged, with women usually favoring the Democratic candidate in presidential elections.\nAccording to political scientists J. Kevin Corder and Christina Wolbrecht, few women turned out to vote in the first national elections after the Nineteenth Amendment gave them the right to do so. In 1920, 36 percent of eligible women voted (compared with 68 percent of men). The low turnout among women was partly due to other barriers to voting, such as literacy tests, long residency requirements, and poll taxes. Inexperience with voting and persistent beliefs that voting was inappropriate for women may also have kept turnout low. The participation gap was lowest between men and women in swing states at the time, in states that had closer races such as Missouri and Kentucky, and where barriers to voting were lower. By 1960, women were turning out to vote in presidential elections in greater numbers than men and a trend of higher female voting engagement has continued into 2018.\nLimitations.\nAfrican-American women.\nAfrican-Americans had gained the right to vote, but for 75 percent of them it was granted in name only, as state constitutions kept them from exercising that right. Prior to the passage of the amendment, Southern politicians held firm in their convictions not to allow African-American women to vote. They had to fight to secure not only their own right to vote, but the right of African-American men as well.\nThree million women south of the Mason\u2013Dixon line remained disfranchised after the passage of the amendment. Election officials regularly obstructed access to the ballot box. As newly enfranchised African-American women attempted to register, officials increased the use of methods that Brent Staples, in an opinion piece for \"The New York Times\", described as fraud, intimidation, poll taxes, and state violence. In 1926, a group of women attempting to register in Birmingham, Alabama were beaten by officials. Incidents such as this, threats of violence and job losses, and legalized prejudicial practices blocked women of color from voting. These practices continued until the Twenty-fourth Amendment was adopted in 1962, whereby the states were prohibited from making voting conditional on poll or other taxes, paving the way to more reforms with the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\nAfrican-Americans continued to face barriers preventing them from exercising their vote until the civil rights movement arose in the 1950s and 1960s, which posited voting rights as civil rights. Nearly a thousand civil rights workers converged on the South to support voting rights as part of Freedom Summer, and the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches brought further participation and support. However, state officials continued to refuse registration until the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which prohibited racial discrimination in voting. For the first time, states were forbidden from imposing discriminatory restrictions on voting eligibility, and mechanisms were placed allowing the federal government to enforce its provisions.\nOther minority groups.\nNative Americans were granted citizenship by an Act of Congress in 1924, but state policies prohibited them from voting. In 1948, a suit brought by World War II veteran Miguel Trujillo resulted in Native Americans gaining the right to vote in New Mexico and Arizona, but some states continued to bar them from voting until 1957.\nPoll taxes and literacy tests kept Latina women from voting. In Puerto Rico, for example, women did not receive the right to vote until 1929, but was limited to literate women until 1935. Further, the 1975 extensions of the Voting Rights Act included requiring bilingual ballots and voting materials in certain regions, making it easier for Latina women to vote.\nNational immigration laws prevented Asians from gaining citizenship until 1952.\nOther limitations.\nAfter adoption of the Nineteenth Amendment, women still faced political limitations. Women had to lobby their state legislators, bring lawsuits, and engage in letter-writing campaigns to earn the right to sit on juries. In California, women won the right to serve on juries four years after passage of the Nineteenth Amendment. In Colorado, it took 33 years. Women continue to face obstacles when running for elective offices, and the Equal Rights Amendment, which would grant women equal rights under the law, has yet to be passed.\nLegacy.\nLeague of Women Voters.\nIn 1920, about six months before the Nineteenth Amendment was ratified, Emma Smith DeVoe and Carrie Chapman Catt agreed to merge the National American Woman Suffrage Association and the National Council of Women Voters to help newly enfranchised women exercise their responsibilities as voters. Originally only women could join the league, but in 1973 the charter was modified to include men. Today, the League of Women Voters operates at the local, state, and national level, with over 1,000 local and 50 state leagues, and one territory league in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Some critics and historians question whether creating an organization dedicated to political education rather than political action made sense in the first few years after ratification, suggesting that the League of Women Voters diverted the energy of activists.\nEqual Rights Amendment.\nAlice Paul and the NWP did not believe the Nineteenth Amendment would be enough to ensure men and women were treated equally, and in 1921 the NWP announced plans to campaign for another amendment which would guarantee equal rights not limited to voting. The first draft of the Equal Rights Amendment, written by Paul and Crystal Eastman and first named \"the Lucretia Mott Amendment\", stated: \"No political, civil, or legal disabilities or inequalities on account of sex or on account of marriage, unless applying equally to both sexes, shall exist within the United States or any territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof.\" Senator Charles Curtis brought it to Congress that year, but it did not make it to the floor for a vote. It was introduced in every congressional session from 1921 to 1971, usually not making it out of committee.\nThe amendment did not have the full support of women's rights activists, and was opposed by Carrie Catt and the League of Women Voters. Whereas the NWP believed in total equality, even if that meant sacrificing benefits given to women through protective legislation, some groups like the Women's Joint Congressional Committee and the Women's Bureau believed the loss of benefits relating to safety regulations, working conditions, lunch breaks, maternity provisions, and other labor protections would outweigh what would be gained. Labor leaders like Alice Hamilton and Mary Anderson argued that it would set their efforts back and make sacrifices of what progress they had made. In response to these concerns, a provision known as \"the Hayden rider\" was added to the ERA to retain special labor protections for women, and passed the Senate in 1950 and 1953, but failed in the House. In 1958, President Eisenhower called on Congress to pass the amendment, but the Hayden rider was controversial, meeting with opposition from the NWP and others who felt it undermined its original purpose.\nThe growing, productive women's movements of the 1960s and 1970s renewed support for the amendment. U.S. Representative Martha Griffiths of Michigan reintroduced it in 1971, leading to its approval by the House of Representatives that year. After it passed in the Senate on March 22, 1972, it went to state legislatures for ratification. Congress originally set a deadline of March 22, 1979, by which point at least 38 states needed to ratify the amendment. It reached 35 by 1977, with broad bipartisan support including both major political parties and Presidents Nixon, Ford, and Carter. However, when Phyllis Schlafly mobilized conservative women in opposition, four states rescinded their ratification, although whether a state may do so is disputed. The amendment did not reach the necessary 38 states by the deadline. President Carter signed a controversial extension of the deadline to 1982, but that time saw no additional ratifications.\nIn the 1990s, ERA supporters resumed efforts for ratification, arguing that the pre-deadline ratifications still applied, that the deadline itself can be lifted, and that only three states were needed. Whether the amendment is still before the states for ratification remains disputed, but in 2014 both Virginia and Illinois state senates voted to ratify, although both were blocked in the house chambers. In 2017, 45 years after the amendment was originally submitted to states, the Nevada legislature became the first to ratify it following expiration of the deadlines. Illinois lawmakers followed in 2018. Another attempt in Virginia passed the Assembly but was defeated on the state senate floor by one vote. The most recent effort to remove the deadline was in early 2019, with proposed legislation from Jackie Speier, accumulating 188 co-sponsors and pending in Congress as of \u00a02019[ [update]].\nCommemorations.\nA &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;7+1\u20442-ton marble slab from a Carrara, Italy, quarry carved into statue called the \"Portrait Monument\" (originally known as the \"Woman's Movement\") by sculptor Adelaide Johnson was unveiled at the Capitol rotunda on February 15, 1921, six months after the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment, on the 101st anniversary of Susan B. Anthony's birth, and during the National Woman's Party's first post-ratification national convention in Washington, D.C. The Party presented it as a gift \"from the women of the U.S.\" The monument is installed in the Capitol rotunda and features busts of Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott. More than fifty women's groups with delegates from every state were represented at the dedication ceremony in 1921 that was presided over by Jane Addams. After the ceremony, the statue was moved temporarily to the Capitol crypt, where it stood for less than a month until Johnson discovered that an inscription stenciled in gold lettering on the back of the monument had been removed. The inscription read, in part: \"Woman, first denied a soul, then called mindless, now arisen declares herself an entity to be reckoned. Spiritually, the woman movement... represents the emancipation of womanhood. The release of the feminine principal in humanity, the moral integration of human evolution come to rescue torn and struggling humanity from its savage self.\" Congress denied passage of several bills to move the statue, whose place in the crypt also held brooms and mops. In 1963, the crypt was cleaned for an exhibition of several statues including this one, which had been dubbed \"The Women in the Bathtub\". In 1995 on the 75th anniversary of the Nineteenth Amendment, women's groups renewed congressional interest in the monument and on May 14, 1997, the statue was finally returned to the rotunda.\nOn August 26, 2016, a monument commemorating Tennessee's role in providing the required 36th state ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment was unveiled in Centennial Park in Nashville, Tennessee. The memorial, erected by the Tennessee Suffrage Monument, Inc. and created by Alan LeQuire, features likenesses of suffragists who were particularly involved in securing Tennessee's ratification: Carrie Chapman Catt; Anne Dallas Dudley; Abby Crawford Milton; Juno Frankie Pierce; and Sue Shelton White. In June 2018, the city of Knoxville, Tennessee, unveiled another sculpture by LeQuire, this one depicting 24-year-old freshman state representative Harry T. Burn and his mother. Representative Burn, at the urging of his mother, cast the deciding vote on August 18, 1920, making Tennessee the final state needed for the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment.\nIn 2018, Utah launched a campaign called Better Days 2020 to \"popularize Utah women's history\". One of its first projects was the unveiling on the Salt Lake City capitol steps of the design for a license plate in recognition of women's suffrage. The commemorative license plate would be available for new or existing car registrations in the state. The year 2020 marks the centennial of the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, as well as the 150th anniversary of the first women voting in Utah, which was the first state in the nation where women cast a ballot.\nAn annual celebration of the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, known as Women's Equality Day, began on August 26, 1973. There usually is heightened attention and news media coverage during momentous anniversaries such as the 75th (1995) and 100th (2020), as well as in 2016 because of the presidential election. For the amendment's centennial, several organizations announced large events or exhibits, including the National Constitution Center and National Archives and Records Administration.\nOn the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment, President Donald Trump posthumously pardoned Susan B. Anthony.\nThe 19th.\nThe 19th, sometimes stylized The 19th*, is a nonprofit, independent news organization based in Austin, Texas which is named after the Nineteenth Amendment, reflecting the organization's mission \"to empower women\u2014particularly those underserved by and underrepresented in American media\u2014with the information, community and tools they need to be equal participants in our democracy.\"\nPopular culture.\nThe Nineteenth Amendment has been featured in a number of songs, films, and television programs. The 1976 song \"Sufferin' Till Suffrage\" from \"Schoolhouse Rock!\", performed by Essra Mohawk and written by Bob Dorough and Tom Yohe, states, in part, \"Not a woman here could vote, no matter what age, Then the Nineteenth Amendment struck down that restrictive rule... Yes the Nineteenth Amendment Struck down that restrictive rule.\" In 2018, various recording artists released an album called \"27: The Most Perfect Album\", featuring songs inspired by the 27 amendments to the U.S. Constitution; Dolly Parton's song inspired by the Nineteenth Amendment is called \"A Woman's Right\".\n\"One Woman, One Vote\" is a 1995 PBS documentary narrated by actor Susan Sarandon chronicling the Seneca Falls Convention through the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment. Another documentary was released in 1999 by filmmaker Ken Burns, \"Not For Ourselves Alone: The Story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton &amp; Susan B. Anthony\". It used archival footage and commentary by actors Ann Dowd, Julie Harris, Sally Kellerman and Amy Madigan. In 2013, John Green, the best-selling author of \"The Fault in Our Stars\", produced a video entitled \"Women in the 19th Century: Crash Course US History #31\", providing an overview of the women's movement leading to the Nineteenth Amendment.\nThe 2004 drama \"Iron Jawed Angels\" depicting suffragists Alice Paul and Lucy Burns, played by actors Hilary Swank and Frances O'Connor, respectively, as they help secure the Nineteenth Amendment. In August 2018, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Academy Award-winning director/producer Steven Spielberg announced plans to make a television series based on Elaine Weiss's best-selling book, \"\".\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The amendment was proposed by Congress on December 18, 1917, and ratified by the requisite number of states on January 16, 1919. The Eighteenth Amendment was repealed by the Twenty-first Amendment on December 5, 1933, making it the only constitutional amendment in American history to be repealed.\nThe Eighteenth Amendment was the product of decades of efforts by the temperance movement, which held that a ban on the sale of alcohol would ameliorate poverty and other societal problems. The Eighteenth Amendment declared the production, transport, and sale of intoxicating liquors illegal, although it did not outlaw possession or consumption of alcohol. Shortly after the amendment was ratified, Congress passed the Volstead Act to provide for the federal enforcement of Prohibition. The Volstead Act declared that liquor, wine, and beer qualified as intoxicating liquors, and were therefore prohibited. Under the terms of the Eighteenth Amendment, Prohibition began on January 17, 1920, one year after the amendment was ratified.\nAlthough the Eighteenth Amendment led to a decline in alcohol consumption in the United States, nationwide enforcement of Prohibition proved difficult, particularly in cities. Alcohol smuggling (known as rum-running or bootlegging) and illicit bars (speakeasies) became popular in many areas. Public sentiment began to turn against Prohibition during the 1920s, and 1932 Democratic presidential nominee Franklin D. Roosevelt called for its repeal.\nText.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSection 1. After one year from the ratification of this article the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from the United States and all territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof for beverage purposes is hereby prohibited.\nSection 2. The Congress and the several States shall have concurrent power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.\nSection 3. This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of the several States, as provided in the Constitution, within seven years from the date of the submission hereof to the States by the Congress.\nBackground.\nThe Eighteenth Amendment was the result of decades of effort by the temperance movement in the United States and at the time was generally considered a progressive amendment. Founded in 1893 in Oberlin, Ohio, the Anti-Saloon League (ASL) started in 1906 a campaign to ban the sale of alcohol at the state level. Their speeches, advertisements, and public demonstrations claimed that prohibition of alcohol would eliminate poverty and ameliorate social problems such as immoral sexual behavior and violence. The ASL argued that prohibition would inspire new forms of sociability, create happier families, reduce workplace accidents, and improve the world overall. (Following the repeal of Prohibition, the group merged into the National Temperance League.)\nOther groups, such as the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, also launched efforts to ban the sale, manufacture, and distribution of alcoholic beverages. Churches were also highly influential in gaining new members and support, garnering 6,000 local societies in several different states. The well-known reformer Carrie Nation became a household name for her militancy, such as vandalizing saloon property. Many state legislatures had already enacted statewide prohibition prior to the ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment but did not ban the consumption of alcohol in most households. By 1916, 23 of 48 states had already passed laws against saloons, some even banning the manufacture of alcohol.\nProposal and ratification.\nOn August 1, 1917, the Senate passed a resolution containing the language of the amendment to be presented to the states for ratification. The vote was 65 to 20, with the Democrats voting 36 in favor and 12 in opposition and the Republicans voting 29 in favor and 8in opposition. The House of Representatives passed a revised resolution on December 17, 1917. This was the first amendment to impose a deadline date for ratification. If ratification did not occur before the deadline date, the amendment would be discarded.\nIn the House, the vote was 282 to 128, with the Democrats voting 141 in favor and 64 in opposition and the Republicans voting 137 in favor and 62 in opposition. Four independents in the House voted in favor and two voted against the amendment. It was officially proposed by the Congress to the states when the Senate passed the resolution by a vote of 47 to 8 the next day, December 18.\nThe amendment and its enabling legislation did not ban the consumption of alcohol outright but prohibited the sale, manufacture, and distribution of alcohol in the United States. Those caught selling, manufacturing, or distributing alcoholic beverages would be subject to arrest. The amendment superseded the many state and regional restrictions already in place.\nRatification was achieved on January 16, 1919, when Nebraska became the 36th of the 48 states to ratify the amendment. On January 29, acting secretary of state Frank L. Polk certified the ratification. By 1922, 46 states had ratified the amendment.The following states ratified the amendment:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTwo states rejected the amendment:\nTo define the language used in the amendment, Congress enacted enabling legislation called the National Prohibition Act, better known as the Volstead Act, on October 28, 1919. President Woodrow Wilson vetoed that bill, but the House of Representatives immediately voted to override the veto and the Senate followed suit the next day. The Volstead Act set the starting date for nationwide prohibition as January 17, 1920, the earliest date allowed by the Eighteenth Amendment.\nThe Volstead Act.\nThis legislation that would become the National Prohibition Act was conceived and introduced by Wayne Wheeler, a leader of the Anti-Saloon League, a group that found alcohol responsible for almost all of society's problems and that also ran many campaigns against the sale of alcohol. The law was strongly supported by the powerful Minnesota Republican congressman Andrew Volstead, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, whose name came to be informally associated with the act. The act laid the groundwork for Prohibition, defining the procedures for banning the distribution of alcohol, including production and distribution.\nVolstead had previously introduced an early version of the law to Congress. It was first brought to the floor on May 27, 1919, but met heavy resistance from Democratic senators. Instead, the so-called \"wet law\" was introduced, an attempt to end the wartime prohibition laws put into effect much earlier. The debate over prohibition persisted for that entire session, as the House was divided among groups who become known as the \"bone-drys\" and the \"wets.\" The Volstead Act finally passed the Republican-led House of Representatives on July 22, 1919, with 287 in favor and 100 opposed.\nHowever, the act was largely a failure, proving unable to prevent mass distribution of alcoholic beverages and also inadvertently causing a massive increase in organized crime. The act defined the terms and enforcement methods of Prohibition until the ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment repealed it in 1933.\nControversies.\nThe proposed amendment was the first to contain a provision setting a deadline for its ratification. That clause of the amendment was challenged, with the case reaching the Supreme Court, which upheld the constitutionality of such a deadline in the case of \"Dillon v. Gloss\" (1921). The Supreme Court also upheld the ratification by the Ohio legislature in \"Hawke v. Smith\" (1920), despite a petition requiring that the matter proceed to ballot.\nThis was not the only controversy around the amendment. The phrase \"intoxicating liquor\" was widely understood to exclude beer and wine (as they are not distilled), and their inclusion in Prohibition surprised many in the general public as well as producers of wine and beer. This controversy caused many Northern states to refuse to abide by the amendment.\nUnder Prohibition, illegal importation and production of alcoholic beverages (such as rum-running and bootlegging) occurred on a large scale nationwide. In urban areas, where the majority of the population tended to oppose Prohibition, enforcement was generally much weaker than in rural areas and smaller towns. Perhaps the most dramatic consequence of Prohibition was its effect on organized crime. As the production and sale of alcohol went further underground, it began to be controlled by the Mafia and other gangs that transformed into sophisticated criminal enterprises that reaped huge profits from the illicit liquor trade.\nOrganized-crime syndicates became skilled at bribing police and politicians to overlook violations of Prohibition during the 1920s. Chicago's Al Capone emerged as the most notorious example, earning an estimated $60million annually from his bootlegging and speakeasy operations. Gambling and prostitution also reached new heights, and a growing number of Americans came to blame Prohibition and to condemn it as a dangerous infringement of individual freedom.\nCalls for repeal.\nPublic sentiment turned against Prohibition by the late 1920s, and the Great Depression only hastened its demise, as opponents argued that the ban on alcohol denied jobs to the unemployed and much-needed revenue to the government. The efforts of the nonpartisan Association Against the Prohibition Amendment (AAPA) added to public disillusionment. In 1932, the platform of Democratic presidential candidate Franklin D. Roosevelt included a plan for repealing the 18th Amendment, and his victory that November led to the end of Prohibition.\nIn February 1933, Congress adopted a resolution proposing the Twenty-first Amendment, which repealed the 18th Amendment and modified the Volstead Act to permit the sale of beer. The resolution required state conventions, rather than the state legislatures, to approve the amendment, effectively reducing the process to a one-state, one-vote referendum rather than a popular vote. A few states continued statewide prohibition after 1933, but by 1966 they all had abandoned it.\nImpact.\nJust after the Eighteenth Amendment's adoption, there was a significant reduction in alcohol consumption among the general public and particularly among low-income groups. There were fewer hospitalizations for alcoholism and likewise fewer liver-related medical problems. However, consumption soon climbed as underworld entrepreneurs began producing dangerous \"rotgut\" alcohol. With the rise of home-distilled alcohol, careless distilling led to as many as 10,000 deaths attributed to wood alcohol (methanol) poisoning. However, during Prohibition, the rate of use and abuse of alcohol remained significantly lower than before enactment.\nThough Prohibition created a new category of crimes involving the production and distribution of alcohol, there was an initial reduction in crime associated with drunkenness. Those who continued to drink alcohol tended to turn to organized criminal syndicates. Law enforcement could not stop much illicit liquor; however, they used \"sting\" operations, such as Prohibition agent Eliot Ness famously using wiretapping to uncover secret breweries. The prisons became crowded, which led to fewer arrests for the distribution of alcohol, as well as those arrested being charged with small fines rather than prison time. The murder rate fell for two years, but then rose to record highs due to gangland killings, a trend that reversed the very year prohibition ended. The homicide rate increased from six per 100,000 population in the pre-Prohibition period to nearly ten. Overall, crime rose 24%, including increases in assault and battery, theft, and burglary.\nAnti-prohibition groups were formed and worked to have the Eighteenth Amendment repealed, which was done by adoption of the Twenty-first Amendment on December 5, 1933.\nBootlegging and organized crime.\nFollowing ratification in 1919, the amendment's effects were long-lasting, leading to increases in crime in many large cities, such as Chicago, New York and Los Angeles. Along with this came many separate forms of illegal alcohol distribution, such as speakeasies, bootlegging, and illegal distilling operations.\nBootlegging started in towns bordering Mexico and Canada as well as in areas with multiple ports and harbors. The alcohol was often supplied by foreign distributors from nations such as Cuba and the Bahamas, and some even came from Newfoundland and islands under French rule.\nIn response, the government employed the Coast Guard to search and detain ships transporting alcohol into the country, but caused several complications such as disputes over national jurisdiction areas at sea. Atlantic City, New Jersey became a frequent location for smuggling operations because of a shipping point nearly three miles offshore that officials could not investigate, further complicating enforcement. The Coast Guard was not well-equipped to chase down bootlegging vessels but began searching ships at sea instead of when they arrived at port, and upgraded its boats to facilitate more efficient and consistent arrests.\nOne complication that plagued the government's enforcement efforts involved forged prescriptions for alcoholic beverages. Many forms of alcohol were sold over the counter purportedly for medical purposes, but some manufacturers falsified evidence that their products were of medicinal value.\nBootlegging was the leading factor in the development of organized-crime rings in large cities, as controlling and distributing liquor was very difficult. Many profitable gangs controlled every aspect of the distribution process, such as concealed brewing and storage, operation of speakeasys, and selling alcohol in restaurants and nightclubs run by crime syndicates. With organized crime becoming a rising problem, control of specific territories was a key objective among gangs, leading to many violent confrontations such as the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre; as a result, murder rates and burglaries dramatically increased between 1920 and 1933. Bootlegging was also found to be a gateway crime for many gangs who would then expand into crimes such as prostitution, gambling rackets, narcotics, loan sharking, extortion, and labor rackets, thus causing problems that persisted long after the amendment was repealed.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The default date specified is the first Monday in December, though Congress is empowered to set another date and the president can summon special sessions.\nThe original text of the Constitution set a duration for the terms of federal elected officials, but not the specific dates on which those terms would begin or end. In September 1788, after the necessary nine states had ratified the Constitution, the Congress of the Confederation set March 4, 1789, as the date \"for commencing proceedings\" of the newly reorganized government. Although the new Congress and presidential administration did not begin operating until April, March 4 was designated as the official start of the newly elected officials' terms, and thus the starting point for the terms of their successors. The Constitution did not specify a date for federal elections; however, by the second presidential election in 1792, Congress had enacted a law requiring presidential electors to be chosen in November or early December. In 1845, the 28th Congress narrowed the appointment in each State of Electors (of President and Vice President) to a single day: The \"Tuesday next after the first Monday in the month of November\". Congressional elections were generally held on the same day.\nIssues.\nThe result of these scheduling decisions was that there was a long, four-month lame duck period between the election and inauguration of the new president. For Congress, the situation was perhaps even more awkward. Because Article I, Section 4, Clause2 mandated a Congressional meeting every December, after the election but before Congressional terms of office had expired, a lame-duck session was required by the Constitution in even-numbered years; the next session was not required until the \"next\" December, meaning new members of Congress might not begin their work until more than a year after they had been elected. Special sessions sometimes met earlier in the year, but this never became a regular practice, despite the Constitution allowing for it. In practice, Congress usually met in a long session beginning in Decembers of odd-numbered years, and in a short lame-duck session in December of even-numbered years.\nThe long lame-duck period might have been a practical necessity at the end of the 18th century, when any newly elected official might require several months to put his affairs in order and then undertake an arduous journey from his home to the national capital, but it eventually had the effect of impeding the functioning of government in the modern age. From the early 19th century, it also meant a lame-duck Congress and presidential administration would fail to adequately respond to a significant national crisis in a timely manner. Each institution could do this on the theory that, at best, a lame-duck Congress or administration had neither the time nor the mandate to tackle problems, whereas the incoming administration or Congress would have both the time and a fresh electoral mandate, to examine and address the problems the nation faced. These problems very likely would have been at the center of the debate of the just-completed election cycle.\nThis dilemma was seen most notably in 1861 and 1933, after the elections of Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt, respectively, plus the newly elected senators and representatives. Under the Constitution at the time, these presidents had to wait four months before they and the incoming Congresses could deal with the secession of Southern states and the Great Depression respectively.\nIn 1916, during World War I, President Woodrow Wilson devised an unorthodox plan to avoid a lame-duck presidency and allow his Republican opponent Charles Evans Hughes to assume presidential powers immediately if Hughes had won the election. In that case, Wilson planned to appoint Hughes as Secretary of State, who under the Presidential Succession Act of 1886 was second in the presidential line of succession. President Wilson and Vice President Thomas R. Marshall would have then both resigned, leaving Hughes to become acting president. The plan was never implemented because Wilson was narrowly re-elected.\nProposal and ratification.\nThe 72nd Congress proposed the Twentieth Amendment on March 2, 1932, and the amendment was ratified by the following states. The Amendment was adopted on January 23, 1933, after 36 states, being three-fourths of the then-existing 48 states, ratified the Amendment.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEffects.\nSection 1 of the Twentieth Amendment prescribes that the start and end of the four-year term of both the president and vice president shall be at noon on January 20. The change superseded the Twelfth Amendment's reference to March4 as the date by which the House of Representatives must\u2014under circumstances where no candidate won an absolute majority of votes for president in the Electoral College\u2014conduct a contingent presidential election. The new date reduced the period between election day in November and Inauguration Day, the presidential transition, by about six weeks. Section1 also specifies noon January 3 as the start and end of the terms of members of the Senate and the House of Representatives; the previous date had also been March 4.\nSection 2 moves the yearly start date of congressional sessions from the first Monday in December, as mandated by Article I, Section 4, Clause 2, to noon on January3 of the same year, though Congress still can by law set another date and the president can summon special sessions. This change eliminated the extended lame duck congressional sessions. As a result of this change, if the Electoral College vote has not resulted in the election of either a president or vice president, the incoming Congress, as opposed to the outgoing one, would conduct a contingent election, following the process set out in the Twelfth Amendment.\nSection 3 further refines the Twelfth Amendment by declaring that if the president-elect dies before Inauguration Day, the vice president-elect will be sworn in as president on that day and serve for the full four-year term to which that person was elected. It further states that if, on Inauguration Day, a president-elect has not yet been chosen, or if the president-elect fails to qualify, the vice president-elect would become acting president on Inauguration Day until a president-elect is chosen or the president-elect qualifies; previously, the Constitution did not say what was to be done if the Electoral College attempted to elect a constitutionally unqualified person as president.\nSection3 also authorizes Congress to determine who should be acting president if a new president and vice president have not been chosen by Inauguration Day. Acting on this authority, Congress added \"failure to qualify\" as a possible condition for presidential succession in the Presidential Succession Act of 1947. The Constitution previously had been silent on this point, and this lack of guidance nearly caused constitutional crises on two occasions: when the House of Representatives seemed unable to break the deadlocked election of 1800, and when Congress seemed unable to resolve the disputed election of 1876.\nSection 4 permits Congress to statutorily clarify what should occur if either the House of Representatives must elect the president, and one of the candidates from whom it may choose dies, or if the Senate must elect the vice president and one of the candidates from whom it may choose dies. Congress has never enacted such a statute.\nEffect on the terms of elected officials.\nOn February 15, 1933, 23 days after the amendment was adopted, President-elect Franklin Roosevelt was the target of an assassination attempt by Giuseppe Zangara. While Roosevelt was not injured, had the attempt been successful, then vice president-elect John Nance Garner would have become president on March 4, 1933, pursuant to Section 3.\nSection 5 delayed Sections 1 and 2 taking effect until the first October 15 following the amendment's ratification. As it was adopted on January 23, 1933, Section 1 shortened the terms of representatives elected to the 73rd Congress (1933\u20131935), as well as those of senators elected for terms ending in 1935, 1937, and 1939, by 60 days, by ending those terms on January 3 of each odd-numbered year rather than the March 4 date on which those terms originally were due to expire. Section 5 also resulted in the 73rd Congress not being required to meet until January 3, 1934.\nThe first Congress to open its first session and begin its members' terms on the new date was the 74th Congress in 1935. The first presidential and vice presidential terms to begin on the date appointed by the Twentieth Amendment were the second terms of President Roosevelt and Vice President Garner, on January 20, 1937. As Section 1 had shortened the first term of both (1933\u20131937) by 43 days, Garner thus served as vice-president for two full terms, but he did not serve a full eight years: his vice presidency spanned from March 4, 1933, to January 20, 1941.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has 192 member states and is headquartered in Bern, Switzerland.\nEstablished in 1874 as the General Postal Union, the UPU is among the oldest extant intergovernmental organizations. It sought to standardize international mail delivery by establishing a uniform postal rate and equal treatment between domestic and foreign mail. The organization adopted its current name in 1878. It operated independently before being incorporated into the UN in 1948.\nThe UPU contains four bodies: the Congress, the Council of Administration (CA), the Postal Operations Council (POC) and the International Bureau (IB). It also oversees the Telematics and Express Mail Service (EMS) cooperatives, which provide international express mail delivery. Pursuant to the UPU's mission, each member state agrees to the same terms for conducting international postal duties.\nHistory.\nBilateral treaties.\nBefore the establishment of the UPU, every pair of countries that exchanged mail had to negotiate a postal treaty with each other. In the absence of a treaty providing for direct delivery of letters, mail had to be forwarded through an intermediate country. Postal arrangements were complex and overlapping. In 1853, the United States had a postal treaty with Prussia, but some states in southern Germany were sending their US-bound mail through France instead. Since there was no postal treaty between the United States and France, the mail had to travel on a British or a Belgian ship. US Postmaster-General James Campbell doubted \"whether ... the arrangement can be safely continued,\" but he saw hope in a postal treaty with Bremen that also covered the Austro-German Postal Union.\nNegotiations for postal treaties could drag on for years. The United States drafted a postal treaty with France in 1852, but the two countries disagreed on how to divide the inland postage, and a treaty was not signed until 1857. However, the treaty was allowed to expire. Elihu Washburne, the new US Minister to France, arrived in Paris in 1869 to find \"the singular spectacle ... of no postal arrangements between two countries connected by so many business and social relations.\" The United States and France finally exchanged ratifications of a postal treaty in July 1874, just three months before the Universal Postal Union made the treaty unnecessary. An exasperated Washburne complained, \"There is no nation in the world more difficult to make treaties with than France.\"\nGeneral Postal Union.\nFaced with such difficulties in exchanging mail with Europe, the United States had already taken the lead in calling for improvements to international mail arrangements. United States Postmaster General Montgomery Blair called for an International Postal Congress in 1863. Meeting in Paris, the delegates laid down some general principles for postal cooperation but failed to come to an agreement.\nThe German victory in the Franco-Prussian War cleared away the obstacles to a postal union. After defeating Napoleon III in 1870, the North German Confederation and the South German states united to form the German Empire. The German Reichspost established a uniform set of postage rates and regulations for the new country, but the uniformity ended at the German border. Different amounts of postage were required to mail a letter from Berlin to New York, depending on which ship carried the letter across the Atlantic Ocean. To bring order to the system of international mail, German Postmaster-General Heinrich von Stephan called for another International Postal Congress in 1874.\nMeeting in Bern, Switzerland, the delegates agreed to all of von Stephan's proposals. The Treaty of Bern was signed on 9 October 1874, establishing what was then known as the \"General Postal Union\".\nThe treaty provided that:\nOne important result of the Treaty was that it was no longer necessary to affix postage stamps of countries that a mailpiece passed through in transit. The UPU provides that stamps from member nations are accepted along the entire international route.\nFurther developments.\nThe Treaty of Bern had been signed by 21 countries, 19 of which were European. After the General Postal Union was established, its membership grew rapidly as other countries joined. At the second Postal Union Congress in 1878, it was renamed the Universal Postal Union.\nFrench was the sole official language of the UPU until English was added as a working language in 1994. The majority of the UPU's documents and publications\u2014including its flagship magazine, \"Union Postale\"\u2014are available in the United Nations' six official languages: French, English, Arabic, Chinese, Russian, and Spanish.\nToward the end of the 19th century, the UPU issued rules concerning stamp design, intended to ensure maximum efficiency in handling international mail. One rule specified that stamp values be given in numerals, as denominations written out in letters were not universally comprehensible. Another required member nations to use the same colors on their stamps issued for post cards (green), normal letters (red) and international mail (blue), a system that remained in use for several decades.\nAfter the founding of the United Nations, the UPU became a specialized agency of the UN in 1948. It is currently the third oldest intergovernmental organization after the Rhine Commission and the International Telecommunication Union.\nTerminal dues.\nOrigin.\nThe 1874 treaty provided for the originating country to keep all of the postage revenue, without compensating the destination country for delivery. The idea was that each letter would generate a reply, so the postal flows would be in balance. However, other classes of mail had imbalanced flows. In 1906, the Italian postal service was delivering 325,000 periodicals mailed from other countries to Italy, while Italian publishers were mailing no periodicals to other countries. The system also encouraged countries to remail through another country, forcing the intermediate postal service to bear the costs of transport to the final destination.\nRemailing was banned in 1924, but the UPU took no action on imbalanced flows until 1969. The problem of imbalanced flows became acute after decolonization, as dozens of former European colonies entered the UPU as independent states. The developing countries received more mail than they sent, so they wanted to be paid for delivery.\nIn 1969, the UPU introduced a system of terminal dues. When two countries had imbalanced mail flows, the country that sent more mail would have to pay a fee to the country that received more mail. The amount was based on the difference in the weight of mail sent and received. Since the Executive Council had been unable to come up with a cost-based compensation scheme after five years of study, terminal dues were set arbitrarily at half a gold franc (0.163 SDR) per kilogram. Also since 1969, it announces the annual best postal services on 9 October, the World Post Day. \nModifications.\nOnce terminal dues had been established, they became a topic of discussion at every future Postal Union Congress. The 1974 Congress tripled the terminal dues to 1.5 gold francs, and the 1979 Congress tripled them again to 4.5 gold francs. The 1984 Congress increased terminal dues by another 45%.\nThe system of terminal dues also created new winners and losers. Since the terminal dues were fixed, low-cost countries that were net recipients would turn a profit on delivering international mail. Developing countries were low-cost recipients, but so were developed countries like the United States and the United Kingdom. Since the dues were payable based on weight, periodicals would be assessed much higher terminal dues than letters.\nThe continuing fiscal imbalances required repeated changes to the system of terminal dues. In 1988 a per-item charge was included in terminal dues to drive up the cost of remailing, an old scourge that had returned. To resolve the problem with periodicals, the UPU adopted a \"threshold\" system in 1991 that set separate letter and periodical rates for countries which receive at least 150 tonnes of mail annually. The 1999 Postal Congress established \"country-specific\" terminal dues for industrialized countries, offering a lower rate to developing countries.\nShifting balances and the United States.\nIn 2010, the United States was a net sender because it was mailing goods to other countries. That year, the United States Postal Service made a $275 million surplus on international mail. In addition, the UPU system was only available to state-run postal services. Low terminal dues gave the United States Postal Service an advantage over private postal services such as DHL and FedEx. To protect its profits on sending international mail, the United States voted with the developing countries to keep terminal dues low. They were opposed by the German Post and the Norwegian Post, which wanted to increase terminal dues.\nHowever, the low terminal dues backfired on the United States due to shifts in mail flows. With the growth of e-commerce, the United States began to import more goods through the mail. In 2015, the United States Postal Service made a net deficit on international mail for the first time. The deficits increased to $80 million in 2017. The UPU established a new remuneration system in 2016, a move that the United States Department of State said would \"dramatically improv[e] USPS's cost coverage for the delivery of ... packets from China and other developing countries.\" However, the Chairman of the Postal Regulatory Commission disagreed.\n2019 Extraordinary Congress.\nWith the outbreak of the China\u2013United States trade war in 2018, the issue of terminal dues was pushed into the forefront. Americans complained that mailing a package from China to the United States cost less than mailing the same package across the street within the United States. At the time, the UPU's Postal Development Indicator scale was used to classify countries into four groups from richest to poorest. The United States was a Group I country, while China was a Group III country, alongside countries like Mexico and Turkey that had similar GDP per capita. As a result, China paid lower terminal dues than the United States. The Presidency of Donald Trump complained that it was \"being forced to heavily subsidize small parcels coming into our country.\" On 17 October 2018, the United States announced that it would withdraw from the UPU in one year and self-declare the rates it charged to other postal services.\nThe Universal Postal Union responded in May 2019 by calling, for only the third time in its history, an Extraordinary Congress for 24\u201326 September 2019. The members voted down a proposal submitted by the United States and Canada, which would have allowed immediate self-declaration of terminal dues. The UPU then unanimously passed a Franco-German compromise to allow self-declared terminal dues of up to 70% of the domestic postage rate and increase the UPU terminal dues by 119\u2013164%, phasing in both changes from 2021 to 2025. In addition, countries receiving more than 75,000 tonnes of mail\u2014currently only the United States\u2014could opt in to accelerated self-declared terminal dues on 1 July 2020 in return for an $8 million annual \"contribution\" to the UPU for five years. Trump adviser Peter Navarro declared that the agreement \"more than achieved the President's goal,\" but he denied that the United States was \"buying\" the deal with its \"contribution\". UPU Director Siva Somasundram hailed the agreement as \"a landmark decision for multilateralism and the Union.\"\nStandards.\nThe UPU's Standards Board develops and maintains a growing number of international standards to improve the exchange of postal-related information between postal operators. It also promotes the compatibility of UPU and international postal initiatives. The organization works closely with postal handling organizations, customers, suppliers and other partners, including various international organizations. The Standards Board ensures that coherent regulations are developed in areas such as electronic data interchange (EDI), mail encoding, postal forms and meters. UPU standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in Part V of the \"General information on UPU Standards\" and are published by the UPU International Bureau in accordance with Part VII of that publication.\nMember countries.\nAll United Nations member states are allowed to become members of the UPU. A non-member state of the United Nations may also become a member if two-thirds of the UPU member countries approve its request. The UPU currently has 192 members (190 states and two joint memberships of dependent territories groups).\nMember states of the UPU are the Vatican City and every UN member except Andorra, Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Palau. These four states have their mail delivered through another UPU member (France and Spain for Andorra, and the United States for the Compact of Free Association states). The overseas constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (Aruba, Cura\u00e7ao and Sint Maarten) are represented as a single UPU member, as are the entire British overseas territories. These members were originally listed separately as \"Colonies, Protectorates, etc.\" in the Universal Postal Convention and they were grandfathered in when membership was restricted to sovereign states.\nObservers.\nPalestine is an observer state in the UN, and it was granted special observer status to the UPU in 1999. In 2008 Israel agreed for Palestine's mail to be routed through Jordan, although this had not been implemented as of November 2012. Palestine began receiving direct mail in 2016. In November 2018, Palestine signed papers of accession to the UPU. However, its bid for membership was defeated in September 2019 by a vote of 56 in support, 23 abstaining, 7 countries in opposition, and 106 countries not responding to the request to vote (which, according to UPU rules, led them to be tallied as abstentions)\u2014leaving the bid substantially short of the required two-thirds majority of UPU members.\nStates with limited recognition.\nStates with limited recognition must route their mail through third parties, since the UPU does not allow direct deliveries.\nCongresses.\nThe Universal Postal Congress is the most important body of the UPU. The main purpose of the quadrennial Congress is to examine proposals to amend the acts of the UPU, including the UPU Constitution, General Regulations, Convention and Postal Payment Services Agreement. The Congress also serves as a forum for participating member countries to discuss a broad range of issues impacting international postal services, such as market trends, regulation and other strategic issues. The first UPU Congress was held in Bern, Switzerland in 1874. Delegates from 22 countries participated. UPU Congresses are held every four years and delegates often receive special philatelic albums produced by member countries covering the period since the previous Congress.\nPhilatelic activities.\nThe Universal Postal Union, in conjunction with the World Association for the Development of Philately, developed the WADP Numbering System (WNS). It was launched on 1 January 2002. The website displays entries for 160 countries and issuing postal entities, with over 25,000 stamps registered since 2002. Many of them have images, which generally remain copyrighted by the issuing country, but the UPU and WADP permit them to be downloaded.\nElectronic telecommunication.\nIn some countries, telegraph and later telephones came under the same government department as the postal system. Similarly there was an International Telegraph Bureau, based in Bern, akin to the UPU. The International Telecommunication Union currently facilitates international electronic communication.\nIn order to integrate postal services and the Internet, the UPU sponsors .post. Developing their own standards, the UPU expects to unveil a whole new range of international digital postal services, including \"e-post\". They have appointed a body, the \".post group (DPG)\", to oversee the development of that platform.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Uralic languages with the most native speakers are Hungarian, Finnish, and Estonian. Other languages with speakers above 100,000 are Erzya, Moksha, Mari, Udmurt and Komi spoken in the European parts of the Russian Federation. Still smaller minority languages are S\u00e1mi languages of the northern Fennoscandia; other members of the Finnic languages, ranging from Livonian in northern Latvia to Karelian in northwesternmost Russia; the Samoyedic languages and the other members of the Ugric languages, Mansi and Khanty spoken in Western Siberia.\nThe name \"Uralic\" derives from the family's purported \"original homeland\" (\"Urheimat\") hypothesized to have been somewhere in the vicinity of the Ural Mountains, and was first proposed by Julius Klaproth in \"Asia Polyglotta\" (1823).\nFinno-Ugric is sometimes used as a synonym for Uralic but more accurately refers to a disputed subdivision of the Uralic languages which excludes the Samoyedic languages. Scholars who do not accept the traditional notion that Samoyedic split first from the rest of the Uralic family may treat the terms as synonymous.\nUralic languages are known for their often complex case systems and vowel harmony.\nOrigin and evolution.\nHomeland.\nProposed homelands of the Proto-Uralic language include:\n \"distinctive in western Eurasia. ... typological properties are eastern-looking overall, fitting comfortably into northeast Asia, Siberia, or the North Pacific Rim\".\n Uralic-speakers may have spread westwards with the Seima-Turbino route.\nHistory of Uralic linguistics.\nEarly attestations.\nThe first plausible mention of a people speaking a Uralic language is in Tacitus's \"Germania\" (c.\u200998 AD), mentioning the \"Fenni\" (usually interpreted as referring to the S\u00e1mi) and two other possibly Uralic tribes living in the farthest reaches of Scandinavia. There are many possible earlier mentions, including the Iyrcae (perhaps related to Yugra) described by Herodotus living in what is now European Russia, and the Budini, described by Herodotus as notably red-haired (a characteristic feature of the Udmurts) and living in northeast Ukraine and/or adjacent parts of Russia. In the late 15th century, European scholars noted the resemblance of the names \"Hungaria\" and \"Yugria\", the names of settlements east of the Ural. They assumed a connection but did not seek linguistic evidence.\nUralic studies.\nThe affinity of Hungarian and Finnish was first proposed in the late 17th century. Three candidates can be credited for the discovery: the German scholar Martin Fogel, the Swedish scholar Georg Stiernhielm, and the Swedish courtier Bengt Skytte. Fogel's unpublished study of the relationship, commissioned by Cosimo III of Tuscany, was clearly the most modern of these: he established several grammatical and lexical parallels between Finnish and Hungarian as well as S\u00e1mi. Stiernhielm commented on the similarities of S\u00e1mi, Estonian, and Finnish, and also on a few similar words between Finnish and Hungarian. These authors were the first to outline what was to become the classification of the Finno-Ugric, and later Uralic family. This proposal received some of its initial impetus from the fact that these languages, unlike most of the other languages spoken in Europe, are not part of what is now known as the Indo-European family. In 1717, the Swedish professor Olof Rudbeck proposed about 100 etymologies connecting Finnish and Hungarian, of which about 40 are still considered valid. Several early reports comparing Finnish or Hungarian with Mordvin, Mari or Khanty were additionally collected by Gottfried Leibniz and edited by his assistant Johann Georg von Eckhart.\nIn 1730, Philip Johan von Strahlenberg published his book (\"The Northern and Eastern Parts of Europe and Asia\"), surveying the geography, peoples and languages of Russia. All the main groups of the Uralic languages were already identified here. Nonetheless, these relationships were not widely accepted. Hungarian intellectuals especially were not interested in the theory and preferred to assume connections with Turkic tribes, an attitude characterized by Merritt Ruhlen as due to \"the wild unfettered Romanticism of the epoch\". Still, in spite of this hostile climate, the Hungarian Jesuit J\u00e1nos Sajnovics traveled with Maximilian Hell to survey the alleged relationship between Hungarian and S\u00e1mi, while they were also on a mission to observe the 1769 Venus transit. Sajnovics published his results in 1770, arguing for a relationship based on several grammatical features. In 1799, the Hungarian S\u00e1muel Gyarmathi published the most complete work on Finno-Ugric to that date.\nUp to the beginning of the 19th century, knowledge of the Uralic languages spoken in Russia had remained restricted to scanty observations by travelers. Already the Finnish historian Henrik Gabriel Porthan had stressed that further progress would require dedicated field missions. One of the first of these was undertaken by Anders Johan Sj\u00f6gren, who brought the Vepsians to general knowledge and elucidated in detail the relatedness of Finnish and Komi. Still more extensive were the field research expeditions made in the 1840s by Matthias Castr\u00e9n (1813\u20131852) and Antal Reguly (1819\u20131858), who focused especially on the Samoyedic and the Ob-Ugric languages, respectively. Reguly's materials were worked on by the Hungarian linguist P\u00e1l Hunfalvy (1810\u20131891) and German Josef Budenz (1836\u20131892), who both supported the Uralic affinity of Hungarian. Budenz was the first scholar to bring this result to popular consciousness in Hungary and to attempt a reconstruction of the Proto-Finno-Ugric grammar and lexicon. Another late-19th-century Hungarian contribution is that of Ign\u00e1cz Hal\u00e1sz (1855\u20131901), who published extensive comparative material of Finno-Ugric and Samoyedic in the 1890s, and whose work is at the base of today's wide acceptance of the inclusion of Samoyedic as a part of the Uralic family. Meanwhile, in the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland, a chair for Finnish language and linguistics at the University of Helsinki was created in 1850, first held by Castr\u00e9n.\nIn 1883, the Finno-Ugrian Society was founded in Helsinki on the proposal of Otto Donner, which would lead to Helsinki overtaking St. Petersburg as the chief northern center of research of the Uralic languages. During the late 19th and early 20th century (until the separation of Finland from Russia following the Russian Revolution), the Society hired many scholars to survey the still less-known Uralic languages. Major researchers of this period included Heikki Paasonen (studying especially the Mordvinic languages), Yrj\u00f6 Wichmann (studying Permic), Artturi Kannisto (Mansi), Kustaa Fredrik Karjalainen (Khanty), Toivo Lehtisalo (Nenets), and Kai Donner (Kamass). The vast amounts of data collected on these expeditions would provide over a century's worth of editing work for later generations of Finnish Uralicists.\nClassification.\nThe Uralic family comprises nine undisputed groups with no consensus classification between them. (Some of the proposals are listed in the next section.) An agnostic approach treats them as separate branches.\nObsolete or native names are displayed in italics.\nThere is also historical evidence of a number of extinct languages of uncertain affiliation:\nTraces of Finno-Ugric substrata, especially in toponymy, in the northern part of European Russia have been proposed as evidence for even more extinct Uralic languages.\nTraditional classification.\nAll Uralic languages are thought to have descended, through independent processes of language change, from Proto-Uralic. The internal structure of the Uralic family has been debated since the family was first proposed. Doubts about the validity of most or all of the proposed higher-order branchings (grouping the nine undisputed families) are becoming more common.\nA traditional classification of the Uralic languages has existed since the late 19th century. It has enjoyed frequent adaptation in whole or in part in encyclopedias, handbooks, and overviews of the Uralic family. Otto Donner's model from 1879 is as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Tree list/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAt Donner's time, the Samoyedic languages were still poorly known, and he was not able to address their position. As they became better known in the early 20th century, they were found to be quite divergent, and they were assumed to have separated already early on. The terminology adopted for this was \"Uralic\" for the entire family, \"Finno-Ugric\" for the non-Samoyedic languages (though \"Finno-Ugric\" has, to this day, remained in use also as a synonym for the whole family). Finno-Ugric and Samoyedic are listed in ISO 639-5 as primary branches of Uralic.\nThe following table lists nodes of the traditional family tree that are recognized in some overview sources.\n &lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;a. Hajd\u00fa describes the Ugric and Volgaic groups as areal units. \n &lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;b. Austerlitz accepts narrower-than-traditional Finno-Ugric and Finno-Permic groups that exclude S\u00e1mi \n &lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;c. H\u00e4kkinen groups Hungarian, Ob-Ugric and Samoyed into a Ugro-Samoyed branch, and groups Balto-Finnic, S\u00e1mi and Mordvin into a Finno-Mordvin branch \n &lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;d. Janhunen accepts a reduced Ugric branch, called 'Mansic', that includes Hungarian and Mansi \nLittle explicit evidence has however been presented in favour of Donner's model since his original proposal, and numerous alternate schemes have been proposed. Especially in Finland, there has been a growing tendency to reject the Finno-Ugric intermediate protolanguage. A recent competing proposal instead unites Ugric and Samoyedic in an \"East Uralic\" group for which shared innovations can be noted.\nThe Finno-Permic grouping still holds some support, though the arrangement of its subgroups is a matter of some dispute. Mordvinic is commonly seen as particularly closely related to or part of Finno-Samic. The term \"Volgaic\" (or \"Volga-Finnic\") was used to denote a branch previously believed to include Mari, Mordvinic and a number of the extinct languages, but it is now obsolete and considered a geographic classification rather than a linguistic one.\nWithin Ugric, uniting Mansi with Hungarian rather than Khanty has been a competing hypothesis to Ob-Ugric.\nLexical isoglosses.\nLexicostatistics has been used in defense of the traditional family tree. A recent re-evaluation of the evidence however fails to find support for Finno-Ugric and Ugric, suggesting four lexically distinct branches (Finno-Permic, Hungarian, Ob-Ugric and Samoyedic).\nOne alternative proposal for a family tree, with emphasis on the development of numerals, is as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Tree list/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPhonological isoglosses.\nAnother proposed tree, more divergent from the standard, focusing on consonant isoglosses (which does not consider the position of the Samoyedic languages) is presented by Viitso (1997), and refined in Viitso (2000):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Tree list/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe grouping of the four bottom-level branches remains to some degree open to interpretation, with competing models of Finno-Saamic vs. Eastern Finno-Ugric (Mari, Mordvinic, Permic-Ugric; *k &gt; \u0263 between vowels, degemination of stops) and Finno-Volgaic (Finno-Saamic, Mari, Mordvinic; *\u03b4\u02b2 &gt; *\u00f0 between vowels) vs. Permic-Ugric. Viitso finds no evidence for a Finno-Permic grouping.\nExtending this approach to cover the Samoyedic languages suggests affinity with Ugric, resulting in the aforementioned East Uralic grouping, as it also shares the same sibilant developments. A further non-trivial Ugric-Samoyedic isogloss is the reduction *k, *x, *w &gt; \u0263 when before *i, and after a vowel (cf. *k &gt; \u0263 above), or adjacent to *t, *s, *\u0161, or *\u015b.\nFinno-Ugric consonant developments after Viitso (2000); Samoyedic changes after Sammallahti (1988)\nThe inverse relationship between consonant gradation and medial lenition of stops (the pattern also continuing within the three families where gradation \"is\" found) is noted by Helimski (1995): an original allophonic gradation system between voiceless and voiced stops would have been easily disrupted by a spreading of voicing to previously unvoiced stops as well.\nHonkola, et al. (2013).\nA computational phylogenetic study by Honkola, et al. (2013) classifies the Uralic languages as follows. Estimated divergence dates from Honkola, et al. (2013) are also given.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Tree list/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTypology.\nStructural characteristics generally said to be typical of Uralic languages include:\nLexicography.\nBasic vocabulary of about 200 words, including body parts (e.g. eye, heart, head, foot, mouth), family members (e.g. father, mother-in-law), animals (e.g. viper, partridge, fish), nature objects (e.g. tree, stone, nest, water), basic verbs (e.g. live, fall, run, make, see, suck, go, die, swim, know), basic pronouns (e.g. who, what, we, you, I), numerals (e.g. two, five); derivatives increase the number of common words.\nSelected cognates.\nThe following is a very brief selection of cognates in basic vocabulary across the Uralic family, which may serve to give an idea of the sound changes involved. This is not a list of translations: cognates have a common origin, but their meaning may be shifted and loanwords may have replaced them.\nOrthographical notes: The hacek denotes postalveolar articulation (\u27e8\u017e\u27e9 , \u27e8\u0161\u27e9 , \u27e8\u010d\u27e9 ) (In Northern S\u00e1mi, (\u27e8\u017e\u27e9 ), while the acute denotes a secondary palatal articulation (\u27e8\u015b\u27e9 , \u27e8\u0107\u27e9 , \u27e8l\u27e9 ) or, in Hungarian, vowel length. The Finnish letter \u27e8y\u27e9 and the letter \u27e8\u00fc\u27e9 in other languages represent the high rounded vowel ; the letters \u27e8\u00e4\u27e9 and \u27e8\u00f6\u27e9 are the front vowels and .\nAs is apparent from the list, Finnish is the most conservative of the Uralic languages presented here, with nearly half the words on the list above identical to their Proto-Uralic reconstructions and most of the remainder only having minor changes, such as the conflation of *\u015b into /s/, or widespread changes such as the loss of *x and alteration of *\u00ef. Finnish has also preserved old Indo-European borrowings relatively unchanged. (An example is \"porsas\" (\"pig\"), loaned from Proto-Indo-European \"*por\u1e31os\" or pre-Proto-Indo-Iranian \"*por\u015bos\", unchanged since loaning save for loss of palatalization, *\u015b &gt; s.)\nMutual intelligibility.\nThe Estonian philologist Mall Hellam proposed cognate sentences that she asserted to be mutually intelligible among the three most widely spoken Uralic languages: Hungarian, Finnish, and Estonian:\nHowever, linguist Geoffrey Pullum reports that neither Finns nor Hungarians could understand the other language's version of the sentence.\nComparison.\nNo Uralic language has exactly the idealized typological profile of the family. Typological features with varying presence among the modern Uralic language groups include:\nNotes:\n &lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;a. Clearly present only in Nganasan. \n &lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;b. Vowel harmony is present in the Uralic languages of Siberia only in some marginal archaic varieties: Nganasan, Southern Mansi and Eastern Khanty. \n &lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;c. Only recently lost in modern Estonian \n &lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;d. A number of umlaut processes are found in Livonian. \n &lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;e. In Komi, but not in Udmurt. \nProposed relations with other language families.\nMany relationships between Uralic and other language families have been suggested, but none of these are generally accepted by linguists at the present time: All of the following hypotheses are minority views at the present time in Uralic studies.\nUralic-Yukaghir.\nThe Uralic\u2013Yukaghir hypothesis identifies Uralic and Yukaghir as independent members of a single language family. Diverging views suggest that the similarities between Uralic and Yukaghir languages are due to ancient contact between the proto-languages. \nEskimo-Uralic.\nThe Eskimo\u2013Uralic hypothesis associates Uralic with the Eskimo\u2013Aleut languages. This is an old thesis whose antecedents go back to the 18th century. An important restatement of it was made by Bergsland (1959).\nUralo-Siberian.\nUralo-Siberian is an expanded form of the Eskimo\u2013Uralic hypothesis. It associates Uralic with Yukaghir, Chukotko-Kamchatkan, and Eskimo\u2013Aleut. It was propounded by Michael Fortescue in 1998. Michael Fortescue (2017) presented new evidence in favor for a connection between Uralic and other Paleo-Siberian languages.\nUral-Altaic.\nTheories proposing a close relationship with the Altaic languages were formerly popular, based on similarities in vocabulary as well as in grammatical and phonological features, in particular the similarities in the Uralic and Altaic pronouns and the presence of agglutination in both sets of languages, as well as vowel harmony in some. For example, the word for \"language\" is similar in Estonian (\"keel\") and Mongolian (\"\u0445\u044d\u043b\" (\"hel\")). These theories are now generally rejected and most such similarities are attributed to language contact or coincidence.\nIndo-Uralic.\nThe Indo-Uralic (or \"Indo-Euralic\") hypothesis suggests that Uralic and Indo-European are related or, in its stronger form, that they are more closely related than either is to any other language family.\nUralo-Dravidian.\nThe hypothesis that the Dravidian languages display similarities with the Uralic language group, suggesting a prolonged period of contact in the past, is popular amongst Dravidian linguists and has been supported by a number of scholars, including Robert Caldwell, Thomas Burrow, Kamil Zvelebil, and Mikhail Andronov. This hypothesis has, however, been rejected by some specialists in Uralic languages, and has in recent times also been criticised by other Dravidian linguists, such as Bhadriraju Krishnamurti. Stefan Georg describes the theory as \"outlandish\" and \"not meriting a second look\" even in contrast to hypotheses such as Uralo-Yukaghir or Indo-Uralic.\nNostratic.\nNostratic associates Uralic, Indo-European, Altaic, Dravidian, Afroasiatic, and various other language families of Asia. The Nostratic hypothesis was first propounded by Holger Pedersen in 1903 and subsequently revived by Vladislav Illich-Svitych and Aharon Dolgopolsky in the 1960s.\nEurasiatic.\nThe proposed (though controversial) Eurasiatic language family resembles Nostratic in including Uralic, Indo-European, and Altaic, but differs from it in excluding the South Caucasian languages, Dravidian, and Afroasiatic and including Chukotko-Kamchatkan, Nivkh, Ainu, and Eskimo\u2013Aleut. It was propounded by Joseph Greenberg in 2000\u20132002. Similar ideas had earlier been expressed by Heinrich Koppelmann in 1933 and by Bj\u00f6rn Collinder in 1965.\nUralic skepticism.\nThe linguist Angela Marcantonio has argued against the validity of several subgroups of the Uralic family, as well against the family itself, claiming that many of the languages are no more closely related to each other than they are to various other Eurasian languages (e.g. Yukaghir or Turkic), and that in particular Hungarian is a language isolate.\nMarcantonio's proposal has been strongly dismissed by most reviewers as unfounded and methodologically flawed. Problems identified by reviewers include:\nOther comparisons.\nVarious unorthodox comparisons have been advanced. These are considered at best spurious fringe-theories by specialists:\nComparison.\nArticle 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (in English): \"All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.\"\nComparison of the text in prominent Uralic languages:\nComparison of the text in other Uralic languages:\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31716", "revid": "45094742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31716", "title": "Utah", "text": "U.S. state\nUtah is a landlocked state in the Mountain West subregion of the Western United States. It is one of the Four Corners states, sharing a border with Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico. It also borders Wyoming to the northeast, Idaho to the north, and Nevada to the west. In comparison to all the U.S. states and territories, Utah, with a population of just over three million, is the 13th-largest by area, the 30th-most populous, and the 11th-least densely populated. Urban development is mostly concentrated in two regions: the Wasatch Front in the north-central part of the state, which includes the state capital, Salt Lake City, and is home to roughly two-thirds of the population; and Washington County in the southwest, which has approximately 180,000 residents. Most of the western half of Utah lies in the Great Basin.\nUtah has been inhabited for thousands of years by various indigenous groups, such as the ancient Puebloans, the Navajo, and the Ute. The first Europeans to arrive \u2013 in the mid-16th century \u2013 were the Spanish. Because of the region's challenging geography and harsh climate, it only became a peripheral part of New Spain (and later of Mexico). Even while it was Mexican territory, many of the Utah region's earliest European settlers were from the United States; notable among these were Mormons who were fleeing marginalization and persecution in the United States and arrived via the so-called Mormon Trail. In 1848, after the Mexican\u2013American War, the region was annexed by the U.S., becoming part of the Utah Territory, which included what later became Colorado and Nevada. Disputes between the dominant Mormon community and the federal government delayed Utah's admission as a state: in 1896, after it agreed to outlaw polygamy, it was admitted as the 45th state.\nPeople from Utah are known as Utahns. Slightly over half of all Utahns are Mormons, the vast majority of whom are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), which has its world headquarters in Salt Lake City; Utah is the only state where a majority of the population belongs to a single church. The LDS Church greatly influences Utah's culture, politics, and daily life. However, since the 1990s, Utah has become both more religiously diverse and more secular.\nUtah has a highly diversified economy, with major sectors including transportation, education, information technology and research, government services, mining, multi-level marketing, and tourism. Utah has been one of the fastest growing states since 2000, with the 2020 U.S. census confirming the fastest population growth in the nation since 2010. St. George was the fastest-growing metropolitan area in the United States from 2000 to 2005. It has the 12th-highest median average income and the least income inequality of any U.S. state. Over time and influenced by climate change, droughts in Utah have been increasing in frequency and severity, putting a further strain on Utah's water security and impacting the state's economy.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Utah\" derives from the name of the Ute tribe, meaning 'people of the mountains'. However, no such word exists in the Utes' language, and the Utes refer to themselves as . The meaning of \"Utes\" as 'the mountain people' has been attributed to the neighboring Pueblo Indians, as well as to the Apache word , which means 'one that is higher up' or 'those that are higher up'. In Spanish, it was pronounced ; subsequently, English-speaking people may have adapted the word as \"Utah\".\nHistory.\nPre-Columbian.\nThousands of years before the arrival of Europeans, the Ancestral Puebloans and the Fremont people lived in what is now known as Utah, some of which spoke languages of the Uto-Aztecan group. Ancestral Pueblo peoples built their homes through excavations in mountains, and the Fremont people built houses of straw before disappearing from the region around the 15th century.\nAnother group of Native Americans, the Navajo, settled in the region around the 18th century. In the mid-18th century, other Uto-Aztecan tribes, including the Goshute, the Paiute, the Shoshone, and the Ute people, also settled in the region. These five groups were present when the first European explorers arrived.\nSpanish exploration (1540).\nThe southern Utah region was explored by the Spanish in 1540, led by Francisco V\u00e1zquez de Coronado while looking for the legendary C\u00edbola. A group led by two Catholic priests\u2014sometimes called the Dom\u00ednguez\u2013Escalante expedition\u2014left Santa Fe in 1776, hoping to find a route to the coast of California. The expedition traveled as far north as Utah Lake and encountered the native residents. The Spanish made further explorations in the region but were not interested in colonizing the area because of its desert nature. In 1821, the year Mexico achieved its independence from Spain, the region became known as part of its territory of Alta California.\nEuropean trappers and fur traders explored some areas of Utah in the early 19th century from Canada and the United States. The city of Provo, Utah, was named for one \u00c9tienne Provost, who visited the area in 1825. The city of Ogden, Utah, was named after Peter Skene Ogden, a Canadian explorer who traded furs in the Weber Valley.\nIn late 1824, Jim Bridger became the first known English-speaking person to sight the Great Salt Lake. Due to the high salinity of its waters, he thought he had found the Pacific Ocean; he subsequently learned this body of water was a giant salt lake. After the discovery of the lake, hundreds of American and Canadian traders and trappers established trading posts in the region. In the 1830s, thousands of migrants traveling from the Eastern United States to the American West began to make stops in the region of the Great Salt Lake, then known as Lake Youta.\nLatter Day Saint settlement (1847).\nFollowing the death of Joseph Smith in 1844, Brigham Young, as president of the Quorum of the Twelve, became the leader of the LDS Church in Nauvoo, Illinois. To address the growing conflicts between his people and their neighbors, Young agreed with Illinois Governor Thomas Ford in October 1845 that the Mormons would leave by the following year.\nYoung and the first group of Mormon pioneers reached the Salt Lake Valley on July 24, 1847. Over the next 22 years, more than 70,000 pioneers crossed the plains and settled in Utah. For the first few years, Brigham Young and the thousands of early settlers of Salt Lake City struggled to survive. The arid desert land was deemed desirable by the Mormons as a place where they could practice their religion without harassment.\nSettlers buried thirty-six Native Americans in one grave after an outbreak of measles occurred during the winter of 1847.\nThe first group of settlers brought three African slaves with them, making Utah the only place in the western United States to have African slavery. The three slaves, Green Flake, Hark Lay, and Oscar Crosby, came west with the first group of settlers in 1847.\nUtah was a Mexican territory when the first pioneers arrived in 1847. Early in the Mexican\u2013American War in late 1846, the United States had taken control of New Mexico and California. The entire Southwest became U.S. territory upon the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, February 2, 1848. The treaty was ratified by the United States Senate on March 11. Learning that California and New Mexico were applying for statehood, the settlers of the Utah area (originally having planned to petition for territorial status) applied for statehood with an ambitious plan for a State of Deseret.\nThe Mormon settlements provided pioneers for other settlements in the West. Salt Lake City became the hub of a \"far-flung commonwealth\" of Mormon settlements. With new church converts coming from the East and around the world, Church leaders often assigned groups of church members as missionaries to establish other settlements throughout the West. They developed irrigation to support fairly large pioneer populations along Utah's Wasatch front (Salt Lake City, Bountiful and Weber Valley, and Provo and Utah Valley). Throughout the remainder of the 19th century, Mormon pioneers established hundreds of other settlements in Utah, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona, Wyoming, California, Canada, and Mexico\u2014including in Las Vegas, Nevada; Franklin, Idaho (the first European settlement in Idaho); San Bernardino, California; Mesa, Arizona; Star Valley, Wyoming; and Carson Valley, Nevada.\nProminent settlements in Utah included St. George, Logan, and Manti (where settlers completed the LDS Church's first three temples in Utah, each started after but finished many years before the larger and better-known temple built in Salt Lake City was completed in 1893), as well as Parowan, Cedar City, Bluff, Moab, Vernal, Fillmore (which served as the territorial capital between 1850 and 1856), Nephi, Levan, Spanish Fork, Springville, Provo Bench (now Orem), Pleasant Grove, American Fork, Lehi, Sandy, Murray, Jordan, Centerville, Farmington, Huntsville, Kaysville, Grantsville, Tooele, Roy, Brigham City, and many other smaller towns and settlements. Young had an expansionist view of the territory that he and the Mormon pioneers were settling, calling it Deseret\u2014which according to the Book of Mormon was an ancient word for \"honeybee\". This is symbolized by the beehive on the Utah flag, and the state's motto, \"Industry\".\nUtah Territory (1850\u20131896).\nThe Utah Territory was much smaller than the proposed state of Deseret, but it still contained all of the present states of Nevada and Utah as well as pieces of modern Wyoming and Colorado. It was created with the Compromise of 1850, and Fillmore, named after President Millard Fillmore, was designated the capital. The territory was given the name Utah after the Ute tribe of Native Americans. Salt Lake City replaced Fillmore as the territorial capital in 1856.\nBy 1850, there were around 100 black people in the territory, the majority of whom were slaves. In Salt Lake County, 26 slaves were counted. In 1852, the territorial legislature passed the Act in Relation to Service and the Act for the relief of Indian Slaves and Prisoners formally legalizing slavery in the territory. Slavery was abolished in the territory during the Civil War.\nIn 1850, following a period of increasing tensions with the Timpanogos, Salt Lake City sent out a force known as the Nauvoo Legion, composed of 90 Mormon militiamen, and attacked an encampment of Timpanogos in what was called the Battle at Fort Utah, but would later be known as the 'Provo River massacre', in which between 40 and 100 Native Americans were killed.\nDisputes between the Mormon inhabitants and the U.S. government intensified due to the practice of plural marriage, or polygamy, among members of the LDS Church. The Mormons were still pushing for the establishment of a State of Deseret with the new borders of the Utah Territory. Most, if not all, of the members of the U.S. government opposed the polygamous practices of the Mormons.\nMembers of the LDS Church were viewed as un-American and rebellious when news of their polygamous practices spread. In 1857, particularly heinous accusations of abdication of government and general immorality were leveled by former associate justice William W. Drummond, among others. The detailed reports of life in Utah caused the administration of James Buchanan to send a secret military \"expedition\" to Utah. When the supposed rebellion should be quelled, Alfred Cumming would take the place of Brigham Young as territorial governor. The resulting conflict is known as the Utah War, nicknamed \"Buchanan's Blunder\" by the Mormon leaders.\nIn September 1857, about 120 American settlers of the Baker\u2013Fancher wagon train, en route to California from Arkansas, were murdered by Utah Territorial Militia and some Paiute Native Americans in the Mountain Meadows massacre.\nBefore troops led by Albert Sidney Johnston entered the territory, Brigham Young ordered all residents of Salt Lake City to evacuate southward to Utah Valley and sent out the Nauvoo Legion to delay the government's advance. Although wagons and supplies were burned, eventually the troops arrived in 1858, and Young surrendered official control to Cumming, although most subsequent commentators claim that Young retained true power in the territory. A steady stream of governors appointed by the president quit the position, often citing the traditions of their supposed territorial government. By agreement with Young, Johnston established Camp Floyd, away from Salt Lake City to the southwest.\nSalt Lake City was the last link of the First Transcontinental Telegraph, completed in October 1861. Brigham Young was among the first to send a message, along with Abraham Lincoln and other officials.\nBecause of the American Civil War, federal troops were pulled out of Utah Territory in 1861. This was a boon to the local economy as the army sold everything in camp for pennies on the dollar before marching back east to join the war. The territory was then left in LDS hands until Patrick E. Connor arrived with a regiment of California volunteers in 1862. Connor established Fort Douglas just east of Salt Lake City and encouraged his people to discover mineral deposits to bring more non-Mormons into the territory. Minerals were discovered in Tooele County and miners began to flock to the territory.\nBeginning in 1865, Utah's Black Hawk War developed into the deadliest conflict in the territory's history. Chief Antonga Black Hawk died in 1870, but fights continued to break out until additional federal troops were sent in to suppress the Ghost Dance of 1872. The war is unique among Indian Wars because it was a three-way conflict, with mounted Timpanogos Utes led by Antonga Black Hawk fighting federal and LDS authorities.\nOn May 10, 1869, the First transcontinental railroad was completed at Promontory Summit, north of the Great Salt Lake. The railroad brought increasing numbers of people into the territory and several influential businesspeople made fortunes there.\nDuring the 1870s and 1880s laws were passed to punish polygamists due, in part, to stories from Utah. Notably, Ann Eliza Young\u2014tenth wife to divorce Brigham Young, women's advocate, national lecturer, and author of \"Wife No.19 or My Life of Bondage\"\u2014and Fanny Stenhouse, author of \"Tell It All: My Life in Mormonism\", testified to the happiness of the very early Church members before polygamy. They independently published their books in 1875. These books and the lectures of Ann Eliza Young have been credited with the United States Congress's passage of anti-polygamy laws by newspapers throughout the United States, as recorded in \"The Ann Eliza Young Vindicator\", a pamphlet which detailed Ms. Young's travels and warm reception throughout her lecture tour.\nT. B. H. Stenhouse, former Utah Mormon polygamist, a Mormon missionary for thirteen years, and a Salt Lake City newspaper owner, finally left Utah and wrote \"The Rocky Mountain Saints\". His book gives a witnessed account of life in Utah, both the good and the bad. He finally left Utah and Mormonism after financial ruin occurred when Brigham Young sent Stenhouse to relocate to Ogden, Utah, according to Stenhouse, to take over his thriving pro-Mormon \"Salt Lake Telegraph\" newspaper. In addition to these testimonies, \"The Confessions of John D. Lee\", written by John D. Lee\u2014alleged \"Scapegoat\" for the Mountain Meadow Massacre\u2014also came out in 1877. The corroborative testimonies coming out of Utah from Mormons and former Mormons influenced Congress and the people of the United States.\nIn the 1890 Manifesto, the LDS Church banned polygamy. When Utah applied for statehood again, it was accepted. One of the conditions for granting Utah statehood was that a ban on polygamy be written into the state constitution. This was a condition required of other western states that were admitted into the Union later. Statehood was officially granted on January 4, 1896.\n20th century to present.\nBeginning in the early 20th century, with the establishment of such national parks as Bryce Canyon National Park and Zion National Park, Utah became known for its natural beauty. Southern Utah became a popular filming spot for arid, rugged scenes featured in the popular mid-century western film genre. From such films, most US residents recognize such natural landmarks as Delicate Arch and \"the Mittens\" of Monument Valley. During the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, with the construction of the Interstate highway system, accessibility to the southern scenic areas was made easier.\nSince the establishment of Alta Ski Area in 1939 and the subsequent development of several ski resorts in the state's mountains, Utah's skiing has become world-renowned. The dry, powdery snow of the Wasatch Range is considered some of the best skiing in the world (the state license plate once claimed \"the Greatest Snow on Earth\"). Salt Lake City won the bid for the 2002 Winter Olympic Games, and this served as a great boost to the economy. The ski resorts have increased in popularity, and many of the Olympic venues built along the Wasatch Front continue to be used for sporting events. Preparation for the Olympics spurred the development of the light-rail system in the Salt Lake Valley, known as TRAX, and the reconstruction of the freeway system around the city. The state will again host the games in 2034.\nIn 1957, Utah created the Utah State Parks Commission with four parks. Today, Utah State Parks manages 43 parks and several undeveloped areas totaling over of land and more than of water. Utah's state parks are scattered throughout Utah, from Bear Lake State Park at the Utah/Idaho border to Edge of the Cedars State Park Museum deep in the Four Corners region and everywhere in between. Utah State Parks is also home to the state's off highway vehicle office, state boating office, and the trails program.\nDuring the late 20th century, the state grew quickly. In the 1970s growth was phenomenal in the suburbs of the Wasatch Front. Sandy was one of the fastest-growing cities in the country at that time. Today, many areas of Utah continue to see boom-time growth. Northern Davis, southern and western Salt Lake, Summit, eastern Tooele, Utah, Wasatch, and Washington counties are all growing very quickly. Management of transportation and urbanization are major issues in politics, as development consumes agricultural land and wilderness areas and transportation is a major reason for poor air quality in Utah.\nGeography and geology.\nUtah is known for its natural diversity and is home to features ranging from arid deserts with dunes to thriving pine forests in mountain valleys. It is a rugged and geographically diverse state at the convergence of three distinct geological regions: the Rocky Mountains, the Great Basin, and the Colorado Plateau.\nUtah covers an area of . It is one of the Four Corners states and is bordered by Idaho in the north, Wyoming in the north and east, Colorado in the east, at a single point by New Mexico to the southeast, by Arizona in the south, and by Nevada in the west. Only three U.S. states (Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming) have exclusively latitude and longitude lines as boundaries.\nOne of Utah's defining characteristics is the variety of its terrain. Running down the middle of the state's northern third is the Wasatch Range, which rises to heights of almost above sea level. Utah is home to world-renowned ski resorts made popular by light, fluffy snow and winter storms that regularly dump up to three feet of it overnight. In the state's northeastern section, running east to west, are the Uinta Mountains, which rise to heights of over . The highest point in the state, Kings Peak, at , lies within the Uinta Mountains.\nAt the western base of the Wasatch Range is the Wasatch Front, a series of valleys and basins that are home to the most populous parts of the state. It stretches approximately from Brigham City at the north end to Nephi at the south end. Approximately 75 percent of the state's population lives in this corridor, and population growth is rapid.\nWestern Utah is a mostly arid desert with a basin and range topography. Small mountain ranges and rugged terrain punctuate the landscape. The Bonneville Salt Flats are an exception, being comparatively flat as a result of once forming the bed of ancient Lake Bonneville. Great Salt Lake, Utah Lake, Sevier Lake, and Rush Lake are all remnants of this ancient freshwater lake, which once covered most of the eastern Great Basin. West of the Great Salt Lake, stretching to the Nevada border, lies the arid Great Salt Lake Desert. One exception to this aridity is Snake Valley, which is (relatively) lush due to large springs and wetlands fed from groundwater derived from snow melt in the Snake Range, Deep Creek Range, and other tall mountains to the west of Snake Valley. Great Basin National Park is just over the Nevada state line in the southern Snake Range. One of western Utah's most impressive, but least visited attractions is Notch Peak, the tallest limestone cliff in North America, located west of Delta.\nMuch of the scenic southern and southeastern landscape (specifically the Colorado Plateau region) is sandstone, specifically Kayenta sandstone and Navajo sandstone. The Colorado River and its tributaries wind their way through the sandstone, creating some of the world's most striking and wild terrain (the area around the confluence of the Colorado and Green Rivers was the last to be mapped in the lower 48 United States). Wind and rain have also sculpted the soft sandstone over millions of years. Canyons, gullies, arches, pinnacles, buttes, bluffs, and mesas are common sights throughout south-central and southeast Utah.\nThis terrain is the central feature of protected state and federal parks such as Arches, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, and Zion national parks, Cedar Breaks, Grand Staircase\u2013Escalante, Hovenweep, and Natural Bridges national monuments, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area (site of the popular tourist destination, Lake Powell), Dead Horse Point and Goblin Valley state parks, and Monument Valley. The Navajo Nation also extends into southeastern Utah, and the tribe is part of the coalition that manages Bears Ears National Monument. Southeastern Utah is also punctuated by the remote, but lofty La Sal, Abajo, and Henry mountain ranges.\nEastern (northern quarter) Utah is a high-elevation area covered mostly by plateaus and basins, particularly the Tavaputs Plateau and San Rafael Swell, which remain mostly inaccessible, and the Uinta Basin, where the majority of eastern Utah's population lives. Economies are dominated by mining, oil shale, oil, and natural gas-drilling, ranching, and recreation. Much of eastern Utah is part of the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation. The most popular destination within northeastern Utah is Dinosaur National Monument near Vernal.\nSouthwestern Utah is the lowest and hottest spot in Utah. It is known as Utah's Dixie because early settlers were able to grow some cotton there. Beaverdam Wash in far southwestern Utah is the lowest point in the state, at . The northernmost portion of the Mojave Desert is also located in this area. Dixie is quickly becoming a popular recreational and retirement destination, and the population is growing rapidly. Although the Wasatch Mountains end at Mount Nebo near Nephi, a complex series of mountain ranges extends south from the southern end of the range down the spine of Utah. Just north of Dixie and east of Cedar City is the state's highest ski resort, Brian Head.\nLike most of the western states, the federal government owns much of the land in Utah. In 2020, 63.1% of the land was either BLM land, or U.S. National Forest, U.S. National Park, U.S. National Monument, National Recreation Area or U.S. Wilderness Area. Utah is the only state where every county contains some national forest.\nClimate.\nUtah features a dry, semi-arid to desert climate; however, its many mountains feature a large variety of climates, with the highest points in the Uinta Mountains being above the timberline. The dry weather is a result of the state's location in the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada in California. The eastern half of the state lies in the rain shadow of the Wasatch Mountains. The primary source of precipitation for the state is the Pacific Ocean, with the state usually lying in the path of large Pacific storms from October to May. In summer, the state, especially southern and eastern Utah, lies in the path of monsoon moisture from the Gulf of California.\nMost of the lowland areas receive less than of precipitation annually, although the I-15 corridor, including the densely populated Wasatch Front, receives approximately . The Great Salt Lake Desert is the driest area of the state, with less than . Snowfall is common in all but the far southern valleys. Although St. George receives only about per year, Salt Lake City sees about , enhanced by the lake-effect snow from the Great Salt Lake, which increases snowfall totals to the south, southeast, and east of the lake.\nSome areas of the Wasatch Range in the path of the lake effect receive up to per year. This micro climate of enhanced snowfall from the Great Salt Lake spans the entire proximity of the lake. The cottonwood canyons adjacent to Salt Lake City are located in the right position to receive more precipitation from the lake. The consistently deep powder snow led Utah's ski industry to adopt the slogan \"the Greatest Snow on Earth\" in the 1980s. In the winter, temperature inversions are a common phenomenon across Utah's low basins and valleys, leading to thick haze and fog that can last for weeks at a time, especially in the Uintah Basin. Although at other times of year, its air quality is good, winter inversions give Salt Lake City some of the worst wintertime pollution in the country.\nPrevious studies have indicated a widespread decline in snowpack over Utah accompanied by a decline in the snow\u2013snow-precipitation ratio while anecdotal evidence claims have been put forward that measured changes in Utah's snowpack are spurious and do not reflect actual change. A 2012 study found that the proportion of winter (January\u2013March) precipitation falling as snow has decreased by nine percent during the last half century, a combined result of a significant increase in rainfall and a minor decrease in snowfall. Meanwhile, observed snow depth across Utah has decreased and is accompanied by consistent decreases in snow cover and surface albedo. Weather systems with the potential to produce precipitation in Utah have decreased in number with those producing snowfall decreasing at a considerably greater rate.\nUtah's temperatures are extreme, with cold temperatures in winter due to its elevation, and very hot summers statewide (except mountain areas and high mountain valleys). Utah is usually protected from major blasts of cold air by mountains lying north and east of the state, although major Arctic blasts can occasionally reach the state. Average January high temperatures range from around in some northern valleys to almost in St. George.\nTemperatures dropping below should be expected on occasion in most areas of the state most years, although some areas see it often (for example, the town of Randolph averages about fifty days per year with temperatures that low). In July, average highs range from about . However, the low humidity and high elevation typically lead to large temperature variations, leading to cool nights on most summer days. The record high temperature in Utah was , recorded south of St. George on July 4, 2007, and the record low was , recorded at Peter Sinks in the Bear River Mountains of northern Utah on February 1, 1985. However, the record low for an inhabited location is at Woodruff on December 12, 1932.\nUtah, like most of the western United States, has few days of thunderstorms. On average, there are fewer than 40 days of thunderstorm activity during the year; however, these storms can be briefly intense when they do occur. They are most likely to occur during monsoon season from about mid-July through mid-September, especially in southern and eastern Utah. Dry lightning strikes and the generally dry weather often spark wildfires in summer, while intense thunderstorms can lead to flash flooding, especially in the rugged terrain of southern Utah. Although spring is the wettest season in northern Utah, late summer is the wettest period for much of the south and east of the state. Tornadoes are uncommon in Utah, with an average of two striking the state yearly, rarely higher than EF1 intensity.\nOne exception of note, however, was the unprecedented Salt Lake City Tornado that moved directly across downtown Salt Lake City on August 11, 1999. The F2 tornado killed one person, injured 60 others, and caused approximately $170\u00a0million in damage; it was the second strongest tornado in the state behind an F3 on August 11, 1993, in the Uinta Mountains. The only other reported tornado fatality in Utah's history was a 7-year-old girl who was killed while camping in Summit County on July 6, 1884.\nWildlife.\nUtah is home to more than 600 vertebrate animal species as well as numerous invertebrates and insects.\nMammals.\nMammals are found in every area of Utah. Non-predatory larger mammals include the plains bison, elk, moose, mountain goat, mule deer, pronghorn, and multiple types of bighorn sheep. Non-predatory small mammals include muskrat, and nutria. Large and small predatory mammals include the black bear, cougar, Canada lynx, bobcat, fox (gray, red, and kit), coyote, badger, black-footed ferret, mink, stoat, long-tailed weasel, raccoon, and otter.\nThe brown bear was formerly found within Utah, but has since been extirpated. There are no confirmed mating pairs of gray wolves in Utah, although there have been sightings in northeastern Utah along the Wyoming border.\nBirds.\nAs of January 2020, there were 466 species included in the official list managed by the Utah Bird Records Committee (UBRC). Of these, 119 are classed as accidental, 29 are classed as occasional, 57 are classed as rare, and 10 have been introduced to Utah or North America. Eleven of the accidental species are also classed as provisional.\nDue to the \"Miracle of the Gulls\" incident in 1848, the most well-known bird in Utah is the California gull, which is also the Utah state bird. A monument in Salt Lake City commemorates the Miracle of the Gulls. Other gulls common to Utah include Bonaparte's gull, the ring-billed gull, and Franklin's gull.\nOther birds commonly found include the American robin, the common starling, finches (black rosy, Cassin's, and goldfinch), the black-billed magpie, mourning doves, sparrows (house, tree, black-chinned, black-throated, Brewer's, and chipping), Clark's grebe, the ferruginous hawk, geese (snow, cackling, and Canada), eagles (golden and bald), California quail, mountain bluebird, and hummingbirds (calliope, black-chinned, and broad-tailed).\nInvertebrates.\nUtah is host to a wide variety of arachnids, insects, mollusks, and other invertebrates. Arachnids include the Arizona bark scorpion, Western black widow spiders, crab spiders, hobo spiders (\"Tegenaria agrestis\"), cellar spiders, American grass spiders, woodlouse spiders. Several spiders found in Utah are often mistaken for the brown recluse spider, including the desert recluse spider (found only in Washington County), the cellar spider, and crevice weaving spiders. The brown recluse spider has not been officially confirmed in Utah as of summer 2020[ [update]].\nOne of the rarest insects in Utah is the Coral Pink Sand Dunes tiger beetle, found only in Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park, near Kanab. It was proposed in 2012 to be listed as a threatened species, but the proposal was not accepted. Other insects include grasshoppers, green stink bugs, the Army cutworm, the monarch butterfly, and Mormon fritillary butterfly. The white-lined sphinx moth is common to most of the United States, but there have been reported outbreaks of large groups of their larvae damaging tomato, grape and garden crops in Utah. Four or five species of firefly are also found across the state.\nIn February 2009, Africanized honeybees were found in southern Utah. The bees had spread into eight counties in Utah, as far north as Grand and Emery counties by May 2017.\nVegetation.\nSeveral thousand plants are native to Utah, including a variety of trees, shrubs, cacti, herbaceous plants, and grasses. As of 2018[ [update]], there are 3,930 species of plants in Utah, with 3,128 of those being indigenous and 792 being introduced through various means.\nCommon trees include pines/pi\u00f1ons (white fir, Colorado, single-leaf, Great Basin bristlecone, ponderosa, Engelmann spruce, Rocky Mountain white), and Acer grandidentatum, quaking aspen, bigtooth maple, Utah juniper, speckled alder, red birch, Gambel oak, desert willow, blue spruce, and Joshua trees. Utah has a number of named trees, including the Jardine Juniper, Pando, and the Thousand Mile Tree. Shrubs include a number of different ephedras (pitamoreal, Navajo, Arizona, Nevada, Torrey's jointfir, and green Mormon tea), sagebrushes (little, Bigelow, silver, Michaux's wormwood, black, pygmy, bud, and Great Basin), blue elderberry, Utah serviceberry, chokecherry, and skunkbush sumac. Western poison oak, poison sumac, and western poison ivy are all found in Utah.\nThere are many varieties of cacti in Utah's varied deserts, especially in the southern and western parts of the state. Some of these include desert prickly pear, California barrel cactus, fishhook cactus, cholla, beavertail prickly pear, and Uinta Basin hookless cactus. Despite the desert climate, many different grasses are found in Utah, including Mormon needlegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, western alkali grass, squirreltail, desert saltgrass, and cheatgrass.\nSeveral invasive species of plants are considered noxious weeds by the state, including Bermuda grass, field bindweed, henbane, jointed goatgrass, Canada thistle, Balkan and common toadflax, giant cane, couch grass, St. John's wort, hemlock, sword grass, Russian olive, myrtle spurge, Japanese knotweed, salt cedar, and goat's head.\nDemographics.\nAt the 2020 U.S. census, Utah had a population of 3,271,616. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that the population of Utah was 3,205,958 on July 1, 2019, a 16.00% increase since the 2010 U.S. census. The center of population of Utah is located in Utah County in the city of Lehi. Much of the population lives in cities and towns along the Wasatch Front, a metropolitan region that runs north\u2013south with the Wasatch Mountains rising on the eastern side. Growth outside the Wasatch Front is also increasing. The St. George metropolitan area is currently the second fastest-growing in the country after the Las Vegas metropolitan area, while the Heber micropolitan area is also the second fastest-growing in the country (behind Palm Coast, Florida).\nUtah contains five metropolitan areas (Logan, Ogden-Clearfield, Salt Lake City, Provo-Orem, and St. George), and six micropolitan areas (Brigham City, Heber, Vernal, Price, Richfield, and Cedar City).\nAccording to HUD's 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 3,557 homeless people in Utah.\nThe majority of Utah's immigrants come from Mexico.\nHealth and fertility.\nUtah ranks among the highest in total fertility rate, 47th in teenage pregnancy, lowest in percentage of births out of wedlock, lowest in number of abortions per capita, and lowest in percentage of teen pregnancies terminated in abortion. However, statistics relating to pregnancies and abortions may also be artificially low from teenagers going out of state for abortions because of parental notification requirements. Utah has the lowest child poverty rate in the country, despite its young demographics. According to the Gallup-Healthways Global Well-Being Index as of 2012[ [update]], Utahns ranked fourth in overall well-being in the United States. A 2002 national prescription drug study determined that antidepressant drugs were \"prescribed in Utah more often than in any other state, at a rate nearly twice the national average\". The data shows that depression rates in Utah are no higher than the national average. In 2022, Utah had the lowest percent of births to unmarried women of any US state, at 20.3 percent.\nAncestry and race.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe largest ancestry groups in the state are:\nIn 2011, 28.6% of Utah's population younger than the age of one were ethnic minorities, meaning they had at least one parent who was of a race other than non-Hispanic white.\nReligion.\nMormons are the largest religious group in Utah; however, the percentage of Mormons in the overall population has been decreasing. In 2017, 62.8% of Utahns were members of the LDS Church. This declined to 61.2% in 2018 and to 60.7% in 2019. Members of the LDS Church are 34%\u201341% of the people of Salt Lake City. Many of the other major population centers, such as Provo, Logan, Tooele, and St. George, are each mostly LDS, as are many suburban and rural areas. The LDS Church has the largest number of congregations, numbering 4,815 wards. According to results from the 2010 U.S. census, combined with official LDS Church membership statistics, church members represented 62.1% of Utah's total population. The Utah county with the lowest percentage of church members was Grand County, at 26.5%, while the county with the highest percentage was Morgan County, at 86.1%. In addition, the result for the most populated county, Salt Lake County, was 51.4%.\nThough the LDS Church officially maintains a policy of neutrality in regard to political parties, the church's doctrine has a strong regional influence on politics. Another doctrine effect can be seen in Utah's high birth rate (25 percent higher than the national average; the highest for a state in the U.S.). Mormons in Utah tend to have conservative views when it comes to most political issues and the majority of voter-age Utahns are unaffiliated voters (60%) who vote overwhelmingly Republican. Mitt Romney received 72.8% of the Utahn votes in 2012, while John McCain polled 62.5% in the 2008 United States presidential election and 70.9% for George W. Bush in 2004. In 2010 the Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA) reported that the three largest denominational groups in Utah are the LDS Church with 1,910,504 adherents; the Catholic Church with 160,125 adherents, and the Southern Baptist Convention with 12,593 adherents.\nAccording to a Gallup poll, Utah had the third-highest number of people reporting as \"Very Religious\" in 2015, at 55% (trailing only Mississippi and Alabama). However, it was near the national average of people reporting as \"Nonreligious\" (31%), and featured the smallest percentage of people reporting as \"Moderately Religious\" (15%) of any state, being eight points lower than second-lowest state Vermont. In addition, it had the highest average weekly church attendance of any state, at 51%.\nA 2023 paper challenged this perception (claiming only 42% of Utahns are Mormons) however most statistics still show a majority of Utah residents belong to the LDS church; estimates from the LDS church suggests 60.68% of Utah's population belongs to the church whilst some sources put the number as high as 68%. The paper replied that membership count done by the LDS Church is too high for several reasons.\nLanguages.\nThe official language in the state of Utah is English. Utah English is primarily a merger of Northern and Midland American dialects carried west by LDS Church members, whose original New York dialect later incorporated features from northeast Ohio and central Illinois. Conspicuous in the speech of some in the central valley, although less frequent now in Salt Lake City, is a cord-card merger, so that the vowels /\u0251/ an /\u0254/ are pronounced the same before an /\u0279/, such as in the words \"cord\" and \"card\".\nIn 2000, 87.5% of all state residents five years of age or older spoke only English at home, a decrease from 92.2% in 1990. In 2011, one-third of Utah's workforce was reported to be bilingual, developed through a program of acquisition of second languages beginning in elementary school, and related to Mormonism's missionary goals for its young people.\nAge and gender.\nUtah has the highest total birth rate and accordingly, the youngest population of any U.S. state. In 2010, the state's population was 50.2% male and 49.8% female. The life expectancy is 79.3 years.\nEconomy.\nAccording to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Utah's gross state product in 2024 was $300.9 billion, ranking 28th largest in the nation.\nThe per capita personal income was $45,700 in 2012. Major industries of Utah include mining, cattle ranching, salt production, and government services.\nAccording to the 2007 State New Economy Index, Utah has ranked the top state in the nation for Economic Dynamism, determined by \"the degree to which state economies are knowledge-based, globalized, entrepreneurial, information technology-driven and innovation-based\". In 2014, Utah was ranked number one in Forbes' list of \"Best States For Business\". A November 2010 article in \"Newsweek\" magazine highlighted Utah and particularly the Salt Lake City area's economic outlook, calling it \"the new economic Zion\", and examined how the area has been able to bring in high-paying jobs and attract high-tech corporations to the area during a recession. As of September 2014[ [update]], the state's unemployment rate was 3.5%. In terms of \"small business friendliness\", in 2014 Utah emerged as number one, based on a study drawing upon data from more than 12,000 small business owners.\nIn eastern Utah petroleum production is a major industry. Near Salt Lake City, petroleum refining is done by several oil companies. In central Utah, coal production accounts for much of the mining activity.\nAccording to Internal Revenue Service tax returns, Utahns rank first among all U.S. states in the proportion of income given to charity by the wealthy. This is due to the standard ten percent of all earnings that Mormons give to the LDS Church. According to the Corporation for National and Community Service, Utah had an average of 884,000 volunteers between 2008 and 2010, each of whom contributed 89.2 hours per volunteer. This figure equates to $3.8\u00a0billion of service contributed, ranking Utah number one for volunteerism in the nation.\nTaxation.\nUtah collects personal income tax; for tax year the tax is a flat for all taxpayers. This rate has been steadily decreasing by points yearly since , when it was at .\nThe state sales tax has a base rate of 6.45 percent, with cities and counties levying additional local sales taxes that vary among the municipalities. Property taxes are assessed and collected locally. Utah does not charge intangible property taxes and does not impose an inheritance tax.\nTourism.\nTourism is a major industry in Utah. With five national parks (Arches, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, and Zion), Utah has the third most national parks of any state after Alaska and California. In addition, Utah features nine national monuments (Cedar Breaks, Dinosaur, Grand Staircase\u2013Escalante, Hovenweep, Natural Bridges, Bears Ears, Rainbow Bridge, Timpanogos Cave), and Jurassic, two national recreation areas (Flaming Gorge and Glen Canyon), seven national forests (Ashley, Caribou-Targhee, Dixie, Fishlake, Manti-La Sal, Sawtooth, and Uinta-Wasatch-Cache), and numerous state parks and monuments.\nThe Moab area, in the southeastern part of the state, is known for its challenging mountain biking trails, including Slickrock. Moab also hosts the famous Moab Jeep Safari semiannually.\nUtah has seen an increase in tourism since the 2002 Winter Olympics. Park City is home to the United States Ski Team. Utah's ski resorts are primarily located in northern Utah near Salt Lake City, Park City, Ogden, and Provo. Between 2007 and 2011 Deer Valley Park City, has been ranked the top ski resort in North America in a survey organized by \"Ski Magazine\".\nUtah has many significant ski resorts. The 2009 Ski Magazine reader survey concluded that six of the top ten resorts deemed most \"accessible\", and six of the top ten with the best snow conditions, were located in Utah. In Southern Utah, Brian Head Ski Resort is located in the mountains near Cedar City. Former Olympic venues including Utah Olympic Park and Utah Olympic Oval are still in operation for training and competition and allow the public to participate in numerous activities including ski jumping, bobsleigh, and speed skating.\nUtah features many cultural attractions such as Temple Square, the Sundance Film Festival, the Red Rock Film Festival, the DOCUTAH Film Festival, the Utah Data Center, and the Utah Shakespeare Festival. Temple Square is ranked as the 16th most visited tourist attraction in the United States by \"Forbes\" magazine, with more than five million annual visitors.\nOther attractions include Monument Valley, the Great Salt Lake, the Bonneville Salt Flats, and Lake Powell.\nBranding.\nThe state of Utah relies heavily on income from tourists and travelers visiting the state's parks and ski resorts, and thus the need to \"brand\" Utah and create an impression of the state throughout the world has led to several state slogans, the most famous of which is \"The Greatest Snow on Earth\", which has been in use in Utah officially since 1975 (although the slogan was in unofficial use as early as 1962) and now adorns nearly 50 percent of the state's license plates. In 2001, Utah Governor Mike Leavitt approved a new state slogan, \"Utah! Where Ideas Connect\", which lasted until March 10, 2006, when the Utah Travel Council and the office of Governor Jon Huntsman announced that \"Life Elevated\" would be the new state slogan.\nMining.\nBeginning in the late 19th century with the state's mining boom (including the Bingham Canyon Mine, among the world's largest open pit mines), companies attracted large numbers of immigrants with job opportunities. Since the days of the Utah Territory, mining has played a major role in Utah's economy. Historical mining towns include Mercur in Tooele County, Silver Reef in Washington County, Eureka in Juab County, Park City in Summit County, and numerous coal mining camps throughout Carbon County such as Castle Gate, Spring Canyon, and Hiawatha.\nThese settlements were characteristic of the boom and bust cycle that dominated mining towns of the American West. Park City, Utah, and Alta, Utah were boom towns in the early twentieth century. Rich silver mines in the mountains adjacent to the towns led to many people flocking to the towns in search of wealth. During the early part of the Cold War era, uranium was mined in eastern Utah. Today, mining activity still plays a major role in the state's economy. Minerals mined in Utah include copper, gold, silver, molybdenum, zinc, lead, and beryllium. Fossil fuels including coal, petroleum, and natural gas continue to play a large role in Utah's economy, especially in the eastern part of the state in counties such as Carbon, Emery, Grand, and Uintah.\nEnergy.\nUtah extracts more coal and generates more electricity than it consumes. The state has the potential to generate 31.6 TWh/year from 13.1 GW of wind power, and 10,290 TWh/year from solar power using 4,048 GW of photovoltaic (PV), including 5.6 GW of rooftop photovoltaic, and 1,638 GW of concentrated solar power. The Blue Castle Project is working toward building the state's first nuclear power plant near Green River, Utah, originally projected to be completed in 2030.\nUtah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS) is a subdivision of the State of Utah, providing non-profit wholesale electricity, transmission, and other energy services to community-owned power systems in the Intermountain West geographical area.\nTransportation.\nRoad.\nI-15 and I-80 are the main interstate highways in the state, where they intersect and briefly merge near downtown Salt Lake City. I-15 traverses the state north-to-south, entering from Arizona near St. George, paralleling the Wasatch Front, and crossing into Idaho near Portage. I-80 spans northern Utah east-to-west, entering from Nevada at Wendover, crossing the Wasatch Mountains east of Salt Lake City, and entering Wyoming near Evanston. I-84 West enters from Idaho near Snowville (from Boise) and merges with I-15 from Tremonton to Ogden, then heads southeast through the Wasatch Mountains before terminating at I-80 near Echo Junction.\nI-70 splits from I-15 at Cove Fort in central Utah and heads east through mountains and rugged desert terrain, providing quick access to the many national parks and national monuments of southern Utah, and has been noted for its beauty. The stretch from Salina to Green River is the country's longest stretch of interstate without services and, when completed in 1970, was the longest stretch of entirely new highway constructed in the U.S. since the Alaska Highway was completed in 1943.\nRail and transit.\nUtah's Class I freight railroads are the BNSF Railway and the Union Pacific Railway. Interstate passenger rail is provided by Amtrak's daily \"California Zephyr\" train, which runs between Chicago Union Station and Emeryville, California, with stops in Utah at , , , and the Salt Lake City Intermodal Hub. The state was previously served by Amtrak's \"Pioneer\" and \"Desert Wind\" trains. Heritage railroads include the Heber Valley Railroad and the Wild Kingdom Train.\nThe Utah Transit Authority (UTA) operates public transport services throughout the Wasatch Front region. TRAX, the UTA's light rail system, consists of three lines. The Blue Line (formerly Salt Lake/Sandy Line) begins in the suburb of Draper and ends in Downtown Salt Lake City. The Red Line (Mid-Jordan/University Line) begins in the Daybreak Community of South Jordan, a southwestern valley suburb, and ends at the University of Utah. The Green Line begins in West Valley City, passes through downtown Salt Lake City, and ends at Salt Lake City International Airport. The UTA also operates FrontRunner, a commuter rail line running between Ogden and Provo via Salt Lake City.\nThe UTA's bus system stretches from the Salt Lake Valley west to Grantsville and east to Park City. Beyond UTA, the cities of Cedar City, Logan, Park City, and St. George are served by local bus operators. In the winter, the UTA and several private bus companies operate shuttle routes to Utah's ski resorts.\nAir.\nSalt Lake City International Airport is the only international airport in the state and serves as a hub for Delta Air Lines. The airport has consistently ranked first in on-time departures and had the fewest cancellations among U.S. airports. The airport has non-stop service to more than a hundred destinations throughout the United States, Canada, and Mexico, as well as to Amsterdam, London and Paris. Canyonlands Field (near Moab), Cedar City Regional Airport, Ogden-Hinckley Airport, Provo Municipal Airport, St. George Regional Airport, and Vernal Regional Airport all provide limited commercial air service. A new regional airport at St. George opened on January 12, 2011. SkyWest Airlines is also headquartered in St. George and maintains a hub in Salt Lake City.\nLaw and government.\nUtah government is divided into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. The governor is the chief executive of the state and elected for a four-year term; a lieutenant governor is concurrently elected on a joint ticket with the governor. The current governor of Utah is Spencer Cox, who was sworn in on January 4, 2021. In addition to the governor and lieutenant governor, Utah has three other independently elected executive officers: a state auditor, a state treasurer, and an attorney general.\nAs of 2024, J. Bracken Lee (1949\u20131957) was the most recent of three Governors of Utah who was not a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the other two being Simon Bamberger (1917\u20131921) and George Dern (1925\u20131933).\nThe Utah State Legislature consists of a Senate and a House of Representatives. State senators serve four-year terms and representatives two-year terms. The Utah Legislature meets each year in January for an annual 45-day session.\nThe Utah Supreme Court is the court of last resort in Utah. It consists of five justices, who are appointed by the governor, and then subject to retention election. The Utah Court of Appeals handles cases from the trial courts. Trial level courts are the district courts and justice courts. All justices and judges, like those on the Utah Supreme Court, are subject to retention election after appointment.\nIn a 2020 study, Utah was ranked as the 3rd easiest state for citizens to vote in.\nCounties.\nUtah is divided into political jurisdictions designated as \"counties\". Since 1918 there have been 29 counties in the state, ranging from .\nWomen's rights.\nUtah granted full voting rights to women in 1870, 26 years before becoming a state. Among all U.S. states, only Wyoming granted suffrage to women earlier. However, in 1887 the initial Edmunds-Tucker Act was passed by Congress to curtail Mormon influence in the territorial government. One of the provisions of the Act was the repeal of women's suffrage; full suffrage was not returned until Utah was admitted to the Union in 1896.\nUtah is one of the 15 states that have not ratified the U.S. Equal Rights Amendment. Abortion in Utah is legal prior to the 18th week of pregnancy.\nFree-range parenting.\nIn March 2018, Utah passed the United States' first \"free-range parenting\" bill. The bill was signed into law by Republican Governor Gary Herbert and states that parents who allow their children to engage in certain activities without supervision are not considered neglectful.\nConstitution.\nThe constitution of Utah was enacted on May 8, 1895. Notably, the constitution outlawed polygamy, as requested by Congress when Utah had applied for statehood, and reestablished the territorial practice of women's suffrage. Utah's Constitution has been amended many times since its inception.\nCapital punishment.\nUnder Utah law, aggravated murder is the only crime subject to the penalty of death. Utah was the first state to resume executions after the 1972\u20131976 national moratorium on capital punishment ended with \"Gregg v. Georgia\", when Gary Gilmore was executed by firing squad in 1977. Utah is one of only two states to have ever carried out executions by firing squad, and the only one to do so after the moratorium ended.\nAlcohol, tobacco, and gambling laws.\nUtah's laws regarding alcohol, tobacco and gambling are strict. Utah is an alcoholic beverage control state. The Utah Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control regulates the sale of alcohol; wine and spirituous liquors may be purchased only at state liquor stores, and local laws may prohibit the sale of beer and other alcoholic beverages on Sundays. The state bans the sale of fruity alcoholic drinks at grocery stores and convenience stores. The law states that such drinks must now have new state-approved labels on the front of the products that contain capitalized letters in bold type telling consumers the drinks contain alcohol and at what percentage. Utah is the only state that imposes a maximum blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.05% for drivers, as opposed to the 0.08% limit in other states. The Utah Indoor Clean Air Act is a statewide smoking ban that prohibits it in many public places. Utah and Hawaii are the only two states in the United States to outlaw all forms of gambling.\nSame-sex marriage.\nSame-sex marriage became legal in Utah on December 20, 2013, when U.S. District Court Judge Robert J. Shelby issued a ruling in \"Kitchen v. Herbert\". As of close of business December 26, more than 1,225 marriage licenses were issued, with at least 74 percent, or 905 licenses, issued to gay and lesbian couples. The Utah Attorney General's office was granted a stay of the ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court on January 6, 2014, while the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals considered the case. On October 6, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court declined a writ of \"certiorari\", and the 10th Circuit Court issued their mandate later that day, lifting their stay. Same-sex marriages commenced again in Utah that day.\nPolitics.\nIn the late 19th century, the federal government took issue with polygamy in the LDS Church. The LDS Church discontinued plural marriage in 1890, and in 1896 Utah gained admission to the Union. Many new people settled in the area soon after the Mormon pioneers. Relations have often been strained between the LDS population and the non-LDS population. These tensions have played a large part in Utah's history (Liberal Party vs. People's Party).\nUtah votes predominantly Republican. Self-identified Latter-day Saints are more likely to vote for the Republican ticket than non-Mormons. Utah is one of the most Republican states in the nation. Utah was the single most Republican-leaning state in the country in every presidential election from 1976 to 2004, measured by the percentage point margin between the Republican and Democratic candidates. In 2008 Utah was only the third-most Republican state (after Wyoming and Oklahoma), but in 2012, with Mormon Mitt Romney atop the Republican ticket, Utah returned to its position as the most Republican state. However, the 2016 presidential election result saw Republican Donald Trump carry the state (marking the thirteenth consecutive win by the Republican presidential candidate) with only a plurality, the first time this happened since 1992.\nBoth of Utah's U.S. Senators, John Curtis and Mike Lee, are Republican, as are all four of its U.S. Representatives. Ben McAdams is the most recent Democrat to represent Utah in Congress, representing the 4th congressional district, based in Salt Lake City, from 2019 to 2021. He lost re-election to Burgess Owens, a Republican, in 2020. After Jon Huntsman Jr. resigned to serve as U.S. Ambassador to China in 2009, Gary Herbert was sworn in as governor on August 11, 2009. Herbert was elected to serve out the remainder of the term in a special election in 2010, defeating Democratic nominee Salt Lake County Mayor Peter Corroon with 64% of the vote. He won election to a full four-year term in 2012, defeating the Democrat Peter Cooke with 68% of the vote.\nThe LDS Church maintains an official policy of neutrality about political parties and candidates. In the 1970s, then-Apostle Ezra Taft Benson was quoted by the Associated Press that it would be difficult for a faithful Latter-day Saint to be a liberal Democrat. Although the LDS Church has officially repudiated such statements on many occasions, Democratic candidates\u2014including LDS Democrats\u2014believe Republicans capitalize on the perception that the Republican Party is doctrinally superior. Political scientist and pollster Dan Jones explains this disparity by noting that the national Democratic Party is associated with liberal positions on gay marriage and abortion, both of which the LDS Church is against. The Republican Party in heavily Mormon Utah County presents itself as the superior choice for Latter-day Saints. Even though Utah Democratic candidates are predominantly LDS, socially conservative, and pro-life, no Democrat has won in Utah County since 1994.\nDavid Magleby, dean of Social and Behavioral Sciences at Brigham Young University, a lifelong Democrat and a political analyst, asserts that the Republican Party has more conservative positions than the LDS Church. Magleby argues that the locally conservative Democrats are in better accord with LDS doctrine. For example, the Republican Party of Utah opposes almost all abortions while Utah Democrats take a more liberal approach, although more conservative than their national counterparts. On Second Amendment issues, the state GOP has been at odds with the LDS Church's position opposing concealed firearms in places of worship and public spaces. In 1998, the church expressed concern that Utahns perceived the Republican Party as an LDS institution and authorized lifelong Democrat and Seventy Marlin Jensen to promote LDS bipartisanship.\nUtah is much more conservative than the United States as a whole, primarily on social issues. Compared to other Republican-dominated states in the Mountain West such as Idaho and Wyoming, Utah politics have a more moralistic and less libertarian character, according to David Magleby. About 80% of Utah's Legislature are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, while members account for 61 percent of the population. Since becoming a state in 1896, Utah has had only two non-Mormon governors.\nIn 2006, the legislature passed legislation aimed at banning joint custody for a non-biological parent of a child. The custody measure passed the legislature and was vetoed by the governor, a reciprocal benefits supporter. Carbon County's Democrats are generally made up of members of the large Greek, Italian, and Southeastern European communities, whose ancestors migrated in the early 20th century to work in the extensive mining industry. The views common amongst this group are heavily influenced by labor politics, particularly of the New Deal Era. The state's most Republican areas tend to be Utah County, which is the home to Brigham Young University (BYU) in the city of Provo, and nearly all the rural counties. These areas generally hold socially conservative views in line with that of the national Religious Right. The most Democratic areas of the state lie currently in and around Salt Lake City proper.\nThe state has not voted for a Democrat for president since 1964. Historically, Republican presidential nominees score one of their best margins of victory here. Utah was the Republicans' best state in the 1976, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1996, 2000, 2004, and 2012 elections. In 1992, Utah was the only state in the nation where Democratic candidate Bill Clinton finished behind both Republican candidate George HW Bush and Independent candidate Ross Perot. In 2004, Republican George W. Bush won every county in the state and Utah gave him his largest margin of victory of any state. He won the state's five electoral votes by a margin of 46 percentage points with 71.5% of the vote. In the 1996 Presidential elections the Republican candidate received a smaller 54% of the vote while the Democrat earned 34%. In 2020, the Associated Press wrote a piece profiling Utah's political culture during that year's presidential election. The article noted a more bipartisan and cooperative environment, along with conservative support of liberal causes such as LGBT rights and marijuana use, despite the Republican dominance in the state and the political polarization seen in other parts of the U.S. at the time.\nMajor cities and towns.\nUtah's population is concentrated in two areas, the Wasatch Front in the north-central part of the state, with over 2.6\u00a0million residents; and Washington County, in southwestern Utah, locally known as \"Dixie\", with more than 175,000 residents in the metropolitan area.\nAccording to the 2010 census, Utah was the second fastest-growing state (at 23.8 percent) in the United States between 2000 and 2010 (behind Nevada). St. George, in the southwest, is the second fastest-growing metropolitan area in the United States, trailing Greeley, Colorado.\nThe three fastest-growing counties from 2000 to 2010 were Wasatch County (54.7%), Washington County (52.9%), and Tooele County (42.9%). However, Utah County added the most people (148,028). Between 2000 and 2010, Saratoga Springs (1,673%), Herriman (1,330%), Eagle Mountain (893%), Cedar Hills (217%), South Willard (168%), Nibley (166%), Syracuse (159%), West Haven (158%), Lehi (149%), Washington (129%), and Stansbury Park (116%) all at least doubled in population. West Jordan (35,376), Lehi (28,379), St. George (23,234), South Jordan (20,981), West Valley City (20,584), and Herriman (20,262) all added at least 20,000 people.\nColleges and universities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCulture.\nSports.\nUtah is the second-least populous U.S. state to have a major professional sports league franchise after the Vegas Golden Knights joined the National Hockey League in 2017. The Utah Jazz of the National Basketball Association play at the Delta Center in Salt Lake City. The team moved to the city from New Orleans in 1979 and has been one of the most consistently successful teams in the league (although they have yet to win a championship). The Salt Lake City Stars are the G League affiliate of the Jazz. The team moved from Idaho to Utah in 2016. Salt Lake City was previously host to the Utah Stars, who competed in the ABA from 1970 to 1976 and won one championship, and to the Utah Starzz of the WNBA from 1997 to 2003.\nIn 2024, the Utah Mammoth was established, beginning play during the 2024\u201325 National Hockey League season. The team was established using the existing roster, staff and draft picks of the Arizona Coyotes, which were purchased by businessman and Jazz owner Ryan Smith. The Utah Mammoth plays their home games at the Delta Center, sharing the facility with the Jazz. Utah also has one minor league hockey team, the Utah Grizzlies, who play at the Maverik Center and compete in the ECHL.\nReal Salt Lake of Major League Soccer was founded in 2005 and plays their home matches at America First Field in Sandy. RSL remains the only Utah major league sports team to have won a national championship, having won the MLS Cup in 2009. RSL currently operates two adult teams in addition to the MLS side. Real Monarchs, competing in the third-tier MLS Next Pro, is the official reserve side for RSL. The team began to play in the 2015 season at Rio Tinto Stadium, remaining there until moving to Zions Bank Stadium, located at RSL's training center in Herriman, for the 2018 season and beyond. The Utah Royals returned to the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL), the top level of U.S. women's soccer, in 2024. The original team of that name, which shared ownership with RSL and also played at America First Field, started NWSL play in 2018. Due to fallout from controversies surrounding RSL's ownership, leading to the club's eventual sale, RSL shuttered the Royals after the 2020 season, selling its player-related assets to a new Kansas City franchise. Before the creation of the Royals, RSL's main women's side had been Real Salt Lake Women, which began play in the Women's Premier Soccer League in 2008 and moved to United Women's Soccer in 2016, before folding in 2019.\nUtah's highest level Minor League Baseball team is the Triple-A Salt Lake Bees, as a part of the Pacific Coast League. The team previously played at Smith's Ballpark in Salt Lake City, but is set to move to Daybreak Field at America First Square in 2025.\nUtah has seven universities that compete in Division I of the NCAA. Three of the schools have football programs that participate in the top-level Football Bowl Subdivision: BYU and Utah in the Big 12 Conference (with Utah moving from the Pac-12 Conference in 2024), and Utah State in the Mountain West Conference. In addition, Weber State and Southern Utah (SUU) compete in the Big Sky Conference of the FCS. Utah Tech, with an FCS football program, and Utah Valley, with no football program, are members of the Western Athletic Conference (WAC). Utah Tech football plays in the United Athletic Conference, a football-only partnership between the WAC and the Atlantic Sun Conference (ASUN). Most of these schools house select teams outside of their primary conferences; for example, BYU men's volleyball plays in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation and Utah plays men's lacrosse in the ASUN.\nSalt Lake City hosted the 2002 Winter Olympics. After early financial struggles and scandals, the 2002 Olympics eventually became among the most successful Winter Olympics in history from a marketing and financial standpoint. Watched by more than two billion viewers, the Games ended up with a profit of $100\u00a0million.\nUtah has hosted professional golf tournaments such as the Uniting Fore Care Classic, and currently hosts the Utah Championship.\nRugby has been growing quickly in the state of Utah, growing from 17 teams in 2009 to 70 as of 2013[ [update]] with more than 3,000 players, and more than 55 high school varsity teams. The growth has been inspired in part by the 2008 movie \"Forever Strong\". Utah fields two of the most competitive teams in the nation in college rugby\u2014BYU and Utah. BYU has won the National Championship in 2009, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. Formed in 2017, the Utah Warriors are a Major League Rugby team based in Salt Lake City.\nEntertainment.\nUtah is the setting of or the filming location for many books, films, television series, music videos, and video games. Southern Utah is the site of many westerns, including Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and Gunsmoke, along with modern movies like Thelma and Louise and Forrest Gump. The Bonneville Salt Flats are also a popular location, seen in films such as Independence Day and . Utah's capital Salt Lake City is the final location in the video game \"The Last of Us\".\nThe Sundance Film Festival was founded in 1978, and takes place every January in Park City. It is considered one of the \"big five\" film festivals, and is the largest independent film festival in the United States. It will have its final festival in Utah in 2026 and move to Boulder, Colorado starting in 2027.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n\u00a0\"This article incorporates public domain material from the website of the https://\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31717", "revid": "44466778", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31717", "title": "United Kingdom", "text": "Country in Northwestern Europe\nThe United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a country in Northwestern Europe, off the coast of the continental mainland. It comprises England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, with a population of over 69 million in 2024. The UK includes the island of Great Britain, the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and most of the smaller islands within the British Isles, covering . It shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea, the English Channel, the Celtic Sea and the Irish Sea, while maintaining sovereignty over the British Overseas Territories. The capital and largest city of both England and the UK is London; Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast are the national capitals of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nBritain has been inhabited since the Neolithic. In AD\u00a043 the Roman conquest of Britain began. The Roman departure between 383 and 410 was followed by Anglo-Saxon settlement beginning around 450. In 1066 the Normans conquered England. After the Wars of the Roses, the Kingdom of England began to flourish, resulting in the 16th-century annexation of Wales and the establishment of the British Empire. Over the 17th century the role of the British monarchy was reduced, particularly as a result of the English Civil War. In 1707 the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland united under the Treaty of Union to create the Kingdom of Great Britain. In the Georgian era the office of prime minister became established. The Acts of Union 1800 incorporated the Kingdom of Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801. Most of Ireland seceded from the UK in 1922 as the Irish Free State, and the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927 created the present United Kingdom.\nThe UK became the first industrialised country and was the world's foremost power for the majority of the 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly during the \"Pax Britannica\" between 1815 and 1914. The British Empire was the leading economic power for most of the 19th century, a position supported by its agricultural prosperity, its role as a dominant trading nation, a massive industrial capacity, significant technological achievements, and the rise of 19th-century London as the world's principal financial centre. At its height in the 1920s, the empire encompassed almost a quarter of the world's landmass and population, and was the largest empire in history. However, its involvement in the First World War and in the Second World War damaged Britain's economic power, and a global wave of decolonisation led to the independence of most British colonies.\nThe UK is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy with three distinct jurisdictions: England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own governments and parliaments which control various devolved matters. A developed country with an advanced economy, the UK ranks amongst the largest economies by nominal GDP and is one of the world's largest exporters and importers. As a nuclear state with one of the highest defence budgets, the UK maintains one of the strongest militaries in Europe. Its soft power influence can be observed in the legal and political systems of many of its former colonies, and British culture remains globally influential, particularly in language, literature, music and sport. A great power, the UK is part of numerous international organisations and forums.\nEtymology and terminology.\nThe Acts of Union 1707 declared that the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland were \"United into One Kingdom by the Name of Great Britain\". The term \"United Kingdom\" has occasionally been used for the former Kingdom of Great Britain, although its official name from 1707 to 1800 was simply \"Great Britain\". The Acts of Union 1800 formed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Following the partition of Ireland and the independence of the Irish Free State in 1922, which left Northern Ireland as the only part of the island of Ireland within the United Kingdom, the name was changed in 1927 to the \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\".\nAlthough the United Kingdom is a sovereign country, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are widely referred to as countries. The UK Prime Minister's website has used the phrase \"countries within a country\" to describe it. Some statistical summaries, such as those for the twelve NUTS 1 regions, refer to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as \"regions\". Northern Ireland is also referred to as a \"province\". With regard to Northern Ireland, the descriptive name used \"can be controversial, with the choice often revealing one's political preferences\".\nThe term \"Great Britain\" conventionally refers to the island of Great Britain, or politically to England, Scotland and Wales in combination. It is sometimes used as a loose synonym for the United Kingdom as a whole. The word \"England\" is occasionally used incorrectly to refer to the United Kingdom as a whole, a mistake principally made by people from outside the UK.\nThe term \"Britain\" is used as a synonym for Great Britain, but also sometimes for the United Kingdom. Usage is mixed: the style guide of the UK Government prefers the term \"UK\" rather than \"Britain\" or \"British\" (except when referring to embassies), while other government documents acknowledge that both terms refer to the United Kingdom and that elsewhere \"British government\" is used at least as frequently as \"United Kingdom government\". The UK Permanent Committee on Geographical Names recognises \"United Kingdom\", \"UK\" and \"U.K.\" as shortened and abbreviated geopolitical terms for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in its toponymic guidelines; it does not list \"Britain\" but notes that \"it is only the one specific nominal term 'Great Britain' which invariably excludes Northern Ireland\". The BBC historically preferred to use \"Britain\" as shorthand only for Great Britain, though the present style guide does not take a position except that \"Great Britain\" excludes Northern Ireland.\nThe adjective \"British\" is commonly used to refer to matters relating to the United Kingdom and is used in law to refer to United Kingdom citizenship and nationality. People of the United Kingdom use several different terms to describe their national identity and may identify themselves as being British, English, Scottish, Welsh, Northern Irish or Irish; or as having a combination of different national identities.\nHistory.\nPrior to the Treaty of Union.\nSettlement by Cro-Magnons of what was to become the United Kingdom occurred in waves beginning by about 30,000 years ago. The island has been continuously inhabited since the last retreat of ice around 11,500 years ago. By the end of the region's prehistoric period, the population is thought to have belonged largely to a culture termed Insular Celtic, comprising Brittonic Britain and Gaelic Ireland.\nThe Roman conquest, beginning in AD 43, and the 400-year rule of southern Britain, was followed by an invasion by Germanic Anglo-Saxon settlers, reducing the Brittonic area mainly to what was to become Wales, Cornwall and, until the latter stages of the Anglo-Saxon settlement, the Hen Ogledd (northern England and parts of southern Scotland). Most of the region settled by the Anglo-Saxons became unified as the Kingdom of England in the 10th century. Gaelic speakers in north-west Britain (with connections to the north-east of Ireland and traditionally supposed to have migrated from there in the 5th century) united with the Picts to create the Kingdom of Scotland in the 9th century.\nIn 1066 the Normans invaded England from northern France. After conquering England they seized large parts of Wales, conquered much of Ireland and were invited to settle in Scotland, bringing to each country feudalism on the Northern French model and Norman-French culture. The Anglo-Norman ruling class greatly influenced, but eventually assimilated with, the local cultures. Subsequent medieval English kings completed the conquest of Wales and tried unsuccessfully to annex Scotland. Asserting its independence in the 1320 Declaration of Arbroath, Scotland maintained its independence thereafter, albeit in near-constant conflict with England.\nIn 1215 Magna Carta was the first document to state that no government was above the law and that citizens have rights protecting them.\nThe English monarchs, through inheritance of substantial territories in France and claims to the French crown, were also heavily involved in conflicts in France, most notably the Hundred Years' War, while the Kings of Scots were in an alliance with the French during this period. Early modern Britain saw religious conflict resulting from the Reformation and the introduction of Protestant state churches in each country. The English Reformation ushered in political, constitutional, social and cultural change in the 16th century and established the Church of England. It defined a national identity for England and slowly, but profoundly, changed people's religious beliefs. Wales was fully incorporated into the Kingdom of England, and Ireland was constituted as a kingdom in personal union with the English crown. In what was to become Northern Ireland, the lands of the independent Catholic Gaelic nobility were confiscated and given to Protestant settlers from England and Scotland.\nIn 1603 the kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland were united in a personal union when James VI of Scotland inherited the crowns of England and Ireland and moved his court from Edinburgh to London; each country nevertheless remained a separate political entity and retained its separate political, legal and religious institutions.\nIn the mid-17th century, all three kingdoms were involved in a series of connected wars (including the English Civil War) which led to the temporary overthrow of the monarchy, with the execution of King Charles I, and the establishment of the short-lived unitary republic of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland.\nAlthough the monarchy was restored, the Interregnum along with the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the subsequent Bill of Rights 1689 in England and Claim of Right Act 1689 in Scotland ensured that, unlike much of the rest of Europe, royal absolutism would not prevail, and a professed Catholic could never accede to the throne. The British constitution would develop on the basis of constitutional monarchy and the parliamentary system. With the founding of the Royal Society in 1660, science was greatly encouraged. During this period, particularly in England, the development of naval power and the interest in voyages of discovery led to the acquisition and settlement of overseas colonies, particularly in North America and the Caribbean.\nThough previous attempts at uniting the two kingdoms within Great Britain in 1606, 1667 and 1689 had proved unsuccessful, the attempt initiated in 1705 led to the Treaty of Union of 1706 being agreed and ratified by both parliaments.\nUnion of England and Scotland.\nOn 1 May 1707 the Kingdom of Great Britain was formed, the result of the Acts of Union 1707 between the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland. In the 18th century cabinet government developed under Robert Walpole, who is considered the \"de facto\" first prime minister from 1721 to 1742. A series of Jacobite uprisings sought to remove the Protestant House of Hanover from the throne and restore the Catholic House of Stuart. The Jacobites were finally defeated at the Battle of Culloden in 1746, after which the Scottish Highlanders were forcibly assimilated into Scotland by revoking the feudal independence of clan chiefs. The British colonies in North America that broke away in the American War of Independence became the United States. British imperial ambition turned towards Asia, particularly to India.\nBritish merchants played a leading part in the Atlantic slave trade, mainly between 1662 and 1807 when British or British-colonial slave ships transported nearly 3.3\u00a0million slaves from Africa. The slaves were taken to work on plantations, principally in the Caribbean but also in North America. However, with pressure from the abolitionist movement, Parliament banned the trade in 1807, banned slavery in the British Empire in 1833, and Britain took a leading role in the movement to abolish slavery worldwide through the blockade of Africa and pressing other nations to end their trade with a series of treaties.\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\nIn 1800 the parliaments of Great Britain and Ireland each passed an Act of Union, uniting the two kingdoms and creating the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland on 1 January 1801.\nAfter the defeat of France at the end of the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars (1792\u20131815) the United Kingdom emerged as the principal naval and imperial power (with London the largest city in the world from about 1830). Unchallenged at sea, British dominance was later described as the \"Pax Britannica\" (\"British Peace\"), a period of relative peace amongst the great powers (1815\u20131914) during which the British Empire became the global hegemon and adopted the role of global policeman. From 1853 to 1856 Britain took part in the Crimean War, allied with the Ottoman Empire against Tsarist Russia. Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 the British government led by Lord Palmerston assumed direct rule over India. Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies, British dominance of much of world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of regions such as East Asia and Latin America.\nThroughout the Victorian era (1837\u20131901) political attitudes favoured free trade and \"laissez-faire\" policies. Beginning with the Great Reform Act in 1832, Parliament gradually widened the voting franchise, with the 1884 Reform Act championed by William Gladstone granting suffrage to a majority of males for the first time. The British population increased at a dramatic rate, accompanied by rapid urbanisation, causing significant social and economic stresses. By the late 19th century the Conservative Party under Benjamin Disraeli and Lord Salisbury initiated a period of imperial expansion in Africa, maintained a policy of \"splendid isolation\" in Europe, and attempted to contain the influence of the Russian Empire in Afghanistan and Persia, in what came to be known as the Great Game. During this time Canada, Australia and New Zealand were granted self-governing dominion status. At the turn of the century, Britain's industrial dominance became challenged by the German Empire and the United States. The Edwardian era (1901\u20131910) included social reform and home rule for Ireland become important domestic issues, while the Labour Party emerged from an alliance of trade unions and small socialist groups in 1900, and suffragettes campaigned for women's right to vote.\nWorld wars and partition of Ireland.\nBritain was one of the principal Allies that defeated the Central Powers in the First World War (1914\u20131918). Alongside their French, Russian and (after 1917) American counterparts, British armed forces were engaged across much of the British Empire and in several regions of Europe, particularly on the Western Front. The high fatalities of trench warfare caused the loss of much of a generation of men, with lasting social effects in the nation and a great disruption in the social order. Britain had suffered 2.5\u00a0million casualties and finished the war with a huge national debt. \nThe consequences of the war persuaded the government to expand the right to vote in national and local elections to all adult men and most adult women with the Representation of the People Act 1918. After the war Britain became a permanent member of the Executive Council of the League of Nations and received a mandate over a number of former German and Ottoman colonies. Under the leadership of David Lloyd George, the British Empire reached its greatest extent, covering a fifth of the world's land surface and a quarter of its population.\nBy the mid-1920s most of the British population could listen to BBC radio programmes. Experimental television broadcasts began in 1929 and the first scheduled BBC Television Service commenced in 1936. The rise of Irish nationalism, and disputes within Ireland over the terms of Irish Home Rule, led eventually to the partition of the island in 1921. A period of conflict in what is now Northern Ireland occurred from June 1920 until June 1922. The Irish Free State became independent, initially with Dominion status in 1922, and unambiguously independent in 1931. Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom. The 1928 Equal Franchise Act gave women electoral equality with men in national elections. Strikes in the mid-1920s culminated in the General Strike of 1926. Britain had still not recovered from the effects of the First World War when the Great Depression (1929\u20131932) led to considerable unemployment and hardship in the old industrial areas, as well as political and social unrest with rising membership in communist and socialist parties. A coalition government was formed in 1931.\nNonetheless, Britain was described as \"a very wealthy country, formidable in arms, ruthless in pursuit of its interests and sitting at the heart of a global production system.\" After Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland in 1939, Britain entered the Second World War. Despite the defeat of its European allies in the first year, Britain and its empire continued the war against Germany.\nIn 1940 the Royal Air Force defeated the German \"Luftwaffe\" in the Battle of Britain. Urban areas suffered heavy bombing during the Blitz. The Grand Alliance of Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union formed in 1941, leading the Allies against the Axis powers. There were eventual hard-fought victories in the Battle of the Atlantic, the North Africa campaign and the Italian campaign. British forces played important roles in the Normandy landings of 1944 and the liberation of Europe. The British Army led the Burma campaign against Japan, and the British Pacific Fleet fought Japan at sea. British scientists contributed to the American Manhattan Project, whose task was to build a nuclear weapon.\nPost-war 20th century.\nThe UK was one of the Big Three powers (with the US and the Soviet Union) who met to plan the post-war world; it drafted the Declaration by United Nations with the United States and became one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. It worked closely with the United States to establish the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and NATO. The war left the UK severely weakened and financially dependent on the American Marshall Plan, but it was spared the total war that devastated eastern Europe.\nIn the immediate post-war years the Labour government under Clement Attlee initiated a radical programme of reforms, which significantly affected British society in the following decades. Major industries and public utilities were nationalised, a welfare state was established, and a comprehensive, publicly funded healthcare system, the National Health Service, was created. The rise of nationalism in the colonies coincided with Britain's much-diminished economic position after its involvement in the First World War and the Second World War, so that a policy of decolonisation was unavoidable. Independence was granted to India and Pakistan in 1947. Over the next three decades, most colonies of the British Empire gained their independence, and many became members of the Commonwealth of Nations.\nThe UK was the third country to develop a nuclear weapons arsenal, with its first atomic bomb test, Operation Hurricane, in 1952, but the post-war limitations of Britain's international role were illustrated by the Suez Crisis of 1956. The international spread of the English language, the world's most-widely-spoken language and third-most-spoken native language, ensured the continuing international influence of its literature and culture. As a result of a shortage of workers in the 1950s, the government encouraged immigration from Commonwealth countries. In the following decades the UK became a more multiracial and multicultural society. Despite rising living standards in the late 1950s and 1960s, the UK's economic performance was less successful than many of its main competitors such as France, West Germany and Japan. The UK was the first democratic nation to lower its voting age to 18 in 1969.\nIn the decades-long process of European integration the UK was a founding member of the Western European Union, established with the London and Paris Conferences in 1954. In 1960 the UK was one of the seven founding members of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), but in 1973 it left to join the European Communities (EC). In a 1975 referendum 67 per cent voted to stay in it. When the EC became the European Union (EU) in 1992, the UK was one of the 12 founding member states.\nFrom the late 1960s, Northern Ireland experienced communal and paramilitary violence, sometimes affecting other parts of the UK, known as the Troubles. It is usually considered to have ended with the 1998 Belfast \"Good Friday\" Agreement. Following a period of widespread economic slowdown and industrial strife in the 1970s, the Conservative government of the 1980s led by Margaret Thatcher initiated a radical policy of monetarism, deregulation, particularly of the financial sector (for example, the Big Bang in 1986) and labour markets, the sale of state-owned companies (privatisation), and the withdrawal of subsidies to others.\nIn 1982 Argentina invaded the British territories of South Georgia and the Falkland Islands, leading to the 10-week Falklands War in which Argentine forces were defeated. The inhabitants of the islands strongly favour British sovereignty, expressed in a 2013 referendum. From 1984 the British economy was helped by the inflow of substantial North Sea oil revenues. Another British Overseas Territory, Gibraltar, is a key military base; a referendum in 2002 on shared sovereignty with Spain was rejected.\nAround the end of the 20th century, there were major changes to the governance of the UK with the establishment of devolved administrations for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The statutory incorporation followed acceptance of the European Convention on Human Rights. The UK remained a great power with global diplomatic and military influence and a leading role in the United Nations and NATO.\n21st century.\nThe UK broadly supported the United States' approach to the \"war on terror\" in the early 21st century. British troops fought in the war in Afghanistan, but controversy surrounded Britain's military deployment in Iraq, which saw the largest protest in British history in opposition to the government led by Tony Blair.\nThe Great Recession (2007\u20132010) severely affected the British economy, and was followed by a period of weak growth and stagnation. The Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition government of 2010 introduced austerity measures intended to tackle the substantial public deficits. A referendum on Scottish independence in 2014 resulted in the Scottish electorate voting by 55.3 to 44.7 per cent to remain part of the United Kingdom.\nIn 2016, 51.9 per cent of voters in the UK voted to leave the European Union (EU). The UK left the EU in 2020. On 1 May 2021 the EU\u2013UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, a free trade agreement between the UK and the EU, came into force.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a severe impact on the British economy, caused major disruptions to education and had far-reaching impacts on society and politics in 2020 and 2021. The UK was the first country in the world to use an approved COVID-19 vaccine, developing its own vaccine, which allowed the UK's vaccine rollout to be amongst the fastest in the world.\nGeography.\nThe total area of the United Kingdom is approximately , with a land area of . It occupies the major part of the British Isles and includes the island of Great Britain, the north-eastern one-sixth of the island of Ireland and some smaller surrounding islands, meaning it comprises England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. \nGeographically, the United Kingdom lies between the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea with the southeast coast coming within of the coast of northern France, from which it is separated by the English Channel.\nThe nearby island polities of the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey are crown dependencies, in union with the British monarch, but do not strictly form part of the United Kingdom or any of its three jurisdictions or four countries, although the British government retains responsibility for their external affairs. The Isle of Man lies roughly midway between Great Britain and the island of Ireland in the Irish Sea, while the Channel Islands lie just off the northern French coast. \nThe Royal Greenwich Observatory in London was chosen as the defining point of the Prime Meridian at the International Meridian Conference in 1884.\nThe UK lies between latitudes 49\u00b0 and 61\u00b0 N, and longitudes 9\u00b0 W and 2\u00b0 E. Northern Ireland shares a land boundary with the Republic of Ireland and has a coastline. The length of coastline of Great Britain plus its principal islands is about long, with the coastline of the main island Great Britain being of that, though measurements can vary greatly due to the coastline paradox. It is connected to continental Europe by the Channel Tunnel, which at ( underwater) is the longest underwater tunnel in the world.\nThe UK contains four terrestrial ecoregions: Celtic broadleaf forests, English Lowlands beech forests, North Atlantic moist mixed forests, and Caledonian conifer forests. The area of woodland in the UK was estimated to be 3.25\u00a0million hectares in 2023, which represents 13 per cent of its land area.\nClimate.\nMost of the United Kingdom has a temperate climate, with generally cool temperatures and plentiful rainfall all year round. The temperature varies with the seasons seldom dropping below or rising above . Some parts, away from the coast, of upland England, Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland, experience a subpolar oceanic climate. Higher elevations in Scotland experience a continental subarctic climate and the mountains experience a tundra climate.\nThe prevailing wind is from the southwest and bears frequent spells of mild and wet weather from the Atlantic Ocean, although the eastern parts are mostly sheltered from this wind. Since the majority of the rain falls over the western regions, the eastern parts are the driest. Atlantic currents, warmed by the Gulf Stream, bring mild winters, especially in the west where winters are wet and even more so over high ground. Summers are warmest in the southeast of England and coolest in the north. Heavy snowfall can occur in winter and early spring on high ground, and occasionally settles to great depth away from the hills.\nThe average total annual sunshine in the United Kingdom was 1,339.7 hours between 1971 and 2000, which is just under 30% of the maximum possible. The hours of sunshine vary from 1,200 to about 1,580 hours per year. Since 1996 the UK has been receiving above the 1,981 to 2,010 average hours of sunshine.\nClimate change has serious impacts on the country. A third of food price rise in 2023 was attributed to it. In 2024 the United Kingdom ranked 5th out of 180 countries in the Environmental Performance Index. A law has been passed that UK greenhouse gas emissions will be net zero by 2050.\nTopography.\nEngland accounts for 53 per cent of the UK, covering . Most of the country consists of lowland terrain, with upland and mountainous terrain northwest of the Tees\u2013Exe line which roughly divides the UK into lowland and upland areas. Lowland areas include Cornwall, the New Forest, the South Downs and the Norfolk Broads. Upland areas include the Lake District, the Pennines, the Yorkshire Dales, Exmoor and Dartmoor. The main rivers and estuaries are the Thames, Severn, and the Humber. England's highest mountain is Scafell Pike, at in the Lake District; its largest island is the Isle of Wight.\nScotland accounts for 32 per cent of the UK, covering . This includes nearly 800 islands, notably the Hebrides, Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands. Scotland is the most mountainous constituent country of the UK. The Highlands to the north and west are the more rugged region containing the majority of Scotland's mountainous land, including the Cairngorms, Loch Lomond and The Trossachs and Ben Nevis which at is the highest point in the British Isles.\nWales accounts for less than 9 per cent of the UK, covering . It is mostly mountainous, though South Wales is less mountainous than North and Mid Wales. The highest mountains in Wales are in Snowdonia and include Snowdon () which, at , is the highest peak in Wales. Wales has over of coastline including the Pembrokeshire Coast. Several islands lie off the Welsh mainland, the largest of which is Anglesey (\"Ynys M\u00f4n\").\nNorthern Ireland, separated from Great Britain by the Irish Sea and North Channel, has an area of and is mostly hilly. It includes Lough Neagh which, at , is the largest lake in the British Isles by area, Lough Erne, which has over 150 islands, and the Giant's Causeway, which is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. The highest peak in Northern Ireland is Slieve Donard in the Mourne Mountains at .\nPolitics.\nThe UK is a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary democracy operating under the Westminster system, otherwise known as a \"democratic parliamentary monarchy\". It is a centralised, unitary state wherein the Parliament of the United Kingdom is sovereign. Parliament is made up of the elected House of Commons, the appointed House of Lords and the Crown (as personified by the monarch). The main business of Parliament takes place in the two houses, but royal assent is required for a bill to become an act of Parliament (that is, statute law). As a result of parliamentary sovereignty, the British constitution is uncodified, consisting mostly of disparate written sources, including parliamentary statutes, judge-made case law and international treaties, together with constitutional conventions. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court recognises a number of principles underlying the British constitution, such as parliamentary sovereignty, the rule of law, democracy and upholding international law.\nKing Charles III is the monarch and head of state of the UK and 14 other independent sovereign states, referred to as \"Commonwealth realms\". The monarch is formally vested with all executive authority as the personal embodiment of the Crown and is \"fundamental to the law and working of government in the UK\". The disposition of such powers however, including those belonging to the royal prerogative, is generally exercised only on the advice of ministers of the Crown responsible to Parliament and thence to the electorate. Nevertheless, in the performance of official duties the monarch has \"the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn\". In addition the monarch has a number of reserve powers at his disposal to uphold responsible government and prevent constitutional crises.\nFor general elections (elections to the House of Commons), the UK is divided into 650 constituencies, each of which is represented by one member of Parliament (MP) elected by the first-past-the-post system. MPs hold office for up to five years and must then stand for re-election if they wish to continue to be an MP. The Conservative Party, colloquially known as the Tory Party or the Tories, and the Labour Party have been the dominant political parties in the country since the 1920s, leading to the UK being described as a two-party system. However, since the 1920s other political parties have won seats in the House of Commons, although never more than the Conservatives or Labour.\nThe prime minister is the head of government in the UK. Acting under the direction and supervision of a Cabinet of senior ministers selected and led by the prime minister, His Majesty's Government serves as the principal instrument for public policymaking, administers public services and, through the Privy Council, promulgates statutory instruments and tenders advice to the monarch. Nearly all prime ministers have served concurrently as First Lord of the Treasury and all prime ministers have continuously served as First Lord of the Treasury since 1905, Minister for the Civil Service since 1968, and Minister for the Union since 2019. While appointed by the monarch, in modern times the prime minister is, by convention, an MP, the leader of the political party with the most seats in the House of Commons, and holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the House of Commons. The prime minister as at 2025 is Sir Keir Starmer, the leader of the Labour Party.\nAlthough not part of the United Kingdom, the three Crown Dependencies of Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man, as well as the 14 British Overseas Territories, are subject to the sovereignty of the British Crown.\nAdministrative divisions.\nThe geographical division of the United Kingdom into counties or shires began in England and Scotland in the early Middle Ages, and was completed throughout Great Britain and Ireland by the early modern period. Modern local government by elected councils, partly based on the ancient counties, was established by separate Acts of Parliament: in England and Wales in 1888, Scotland in 1889 and Ireland in 1898, meaning there is no consistent system of administrative or geographic demarcation across the UK, and England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland each have their own distinct jurisdictions. Until the 19th century there was little change to those arrangements, but there has since been a constant evolution of role and function.\nLocal government in England is complex, with the distribution of functions varying according to local arrangements. The upper-tier subdivisions of England are the nine regions, used primarily for statistical purposes. One of the regions, Greater London, has had a directly elected assembly and mayor since 2000 following popular support for the proposal in a 1998 referendum.\nLocal government in Scotland is divided into 32 council areas with a wide variation in size and population. The cities of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee are separate council areas, as is the Highland Council, which includes a third of Scotland's area but only just over 200,000\u00a0people. Local councils are made up of elected councillors, of whom there are 1,223.\nLocal government in Wales consists of 22 unitary authorities, each led by a leader and cabinet elected by the council itself. These include the cities of Cardiff, Swansea and Newport, which are unitary authorities in their own right. Elections are held every four years under the first-past-the-post system.\nLocal government in Northern Ireland since 1973 has been organised into 26 district councils, each elected by single transferable vote. Their powers are limited to services such as waste collection, dog control, and maintaining parks and cemeteries. In 2008 the executive agreed on proposals to create 11 new councils to replace the existing system.\nDevolution.\nIn the United Kingdom a process of devolution has transferred various powers from the UK Government to three of the four UK countries\u2014Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales\u2014as well as to the regions of England, which since 1999 have their own governments and parliaments that control various devolved matters. These powers vary and have been moved to the Scottish Government, the Welsh Government, the Northern Ireland Executive and in England, the Greater London Authority and Combined Authorities. Amongst the devolved parliaments across the United Kingdom, the Scottish Parliament has the most extensive responsibilities for devolved powers, and has been described as \"one of the most powerful devolved parliaments in the world\".\nThe UK has an uncodified constitution and constitutional matters are not amongst the powers that have been devolved. Under the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, the UK Parliament could, in theory, therefore, abolish the Scottish Parliament, Senedd or Northern Ireland Assembly. Though in the Scotland Act 2016 and the Wales Act 2017 it states that the Scottish Government and the Welsh Government \"are a permanent part of the United Kingdom's constitutional arrangements\".\nIn practice it would be politically difficult for the UK Parliament to abolish devolution to the Scottish Parliament and the Senedd because these institutions were created by referendums. The political constraints placed upon the UK Parliament's power to interfere with devolution in Northern Ireland are greater still, because devolution in Northern Ireland rests upon an international agreement with the Government of Ireland. The UK Parliament restricts the three devolved parliaments' legislative powers in economic policy matters through an act passed in 2020.\nEngland.\nUnlike Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, England does not have a separate devolved government or national parliament, rather a process of devolution of powers from the central government to local authorities has taken place, first in 1998. The Greater London Authority (GLA) was set up following a referendum in 1998. Colloquially known as City Hall, it is the devolved regional government body for Greater London. It consists of two political branches: an Executive Mayor and the London Assembly, which serves as a check and balance on the Mayor.\nA Combined Authority (CA) is a type of local government institution introduced in England outside Greater London by the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009. CAs allow a group of local authorities to pool appropriate responsibility and receive certain devolved functions from central government in order to deliver transport and economic policy more effectively over a wider area. A Combined County Authority (CCA) is a similar type of local-government institution introduced in England outside Greater London by the Levelling-up and Regeneration Act 2023, but may only be formed by upper-tier authorities: county councils and unitary authorities.\nScotland.\nSince 1999 Scotland has had a devolved national government and parliament with wide-ranging powers over any matter that has not been specifically reserved to the UK Parliament. Scotland has the most devolved powers of any of the three devolved parliaments in the United Kingdom, with full legislative control over education, law and order, the economy, healthcare, elections, Crown Estate Scotland, the planning system and housing. \nAdditional powers were transferred to the Scottish Parliament via the Scotland Act 2012 and the Scotland Act 2016, such as some taxation powers, including full control of income tax on income earned through employment, Land and Buildings Transaction Tax, Landfill Tax, Aggregates Levy, Air Departure Tax and Revenue Scotland, as well as aspects of the energy network, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and onshore oil and gas licensing. Their power over economic issues is significantly constrained by an act of the UK Parliament passed in 2020.\nThe Scottish Government is a Scottish National Party (SNP) minority government, led by the first minister, currently John Swinney, the leader of the SNP. In 2014 the Scottish independence referendum was held, with 55.3 per cent voting against independence from the United Kingdom and 44.7 per cent voting in favour, resulting in Scotland staying within the United Kingdom. Local government in Scotland is divided into 32 council areas with a wide variation in size and population. Local councils are made up of elected councillors, of whom there are 1,223.\nThe Scottish Parliament is separate from the Scottish Government. It is made up of 129 elected members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). It is the law-making body of Scotland, and thus it scrutinises the work of the incumbent Scottish Government and considers any piece of proposed legislation through parliamentary debates, committees and parliamentary questions.\nWales.\nSince 1999 Wales has had a devolved national government and legislature, known as the Senedd. Elections to the Senedd use the additional member system. It has more limited powers than those devolved to Scotland. The Senedd can legislate on any matter not specifically reserved to the UK Parliament by Acts of Senedd Cymru. The Welsh Government is currently a Welsh Labour minority government led by the first minister, Eluned Morgan. Local government in Wales consists of 22 unitary authorities, each led by a leader and cabinet elected by the council itself.\nNorthern Ireland.\nThe devolved form of government in Northern Ireland is based on the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which brought to an end a 30-year period of unionist-nationalist communal conflict known as the Troubles. The Agreement was confirmed by referendum and implemented later that year. It established power sharing arrangements for a devolved government and legislature, referred to as the Northern Ireland Executive and the Northern Ireland Assembly respectively. Elections to the Assembly use the single transferable vote system. The Executive and Assembly have powers similar to those devolved to Scotland. The Executive is led by a diarchy representing unionist and nationalist members of the Assembly. The first minister and deputy first minister of Northern Ireland are the joint heads of government of Northern Ireland. Local government in Northern Ireland since 2015 has been divided between 11 councils with limited responsibilities.\nForeign relations.\nThe UK is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and a member of NATO, AUKUS, the Commonwealth of Nations, the G7, the G20, the OECD, the WTO, the Council of Europe and the OSCE. It maintains the British Council, an organisation specialising in international cultural and educational opportunities in over 100 countries. The UK remains a great power with considerable political, cultural, economic and military influence.\nThe UK is said to have a \"Special Relationship\" with the United States and a close partnership with France \u2013 the \"Entente cordiale\" \u2013 and shares nuclear weapons technology with both countries; the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance is considered to be the oldest binding military alliance in the world. The UK is also closely linked with the Republic of Ireland; the two countries share a Common Travel Area and co-operate through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and the British-Irish Council. Britain's global presence and influence is further amplified through its trading relations, foreign investments, official development assistance and military engagements. \nLaw and criminal justice.\nThe United Kingdom does not have a single legal system as the 1706 Treaty of Union provided for the continuation of Scotland's separate legal system. The UK has three distinct systems of law: English law, Northern Ireland law and Scots law. A new Supreme Court of the United Kingdom came into being in October 2009 to replace the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, including the same members as the Supreme Court, is the highest court of appeal for several independent Commonwealth countries, the British Overseas Territories and the Crown Dependencies.\nBoth English law, which applies in England and Wales, and Northern Ireland law are based on common law (or case law) principles. It originated in England in the Middle Ages and is the basis for many legal systems around the world. The courts of England and Wales are headed by the Senior Courts of England and Wales, consisting of the Court of Appeal, the High Court of Justice for civil cases and the Crown Court for criminal cases. Scots law is a hybrid system based on common-law and civil-law principles. The chief courts are the Court of Session, for civil cases, and the High Court of Justiciary, for criminal cases. The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom serves as the highest court of appeal for civil cases under Scots law.\nCrime in England and Wales increased between 1981 and 1995. Since that peak there has been an overall fall of 66% in recorded crime from 1995 to 2015, according to UK crime statistics. As of June 2023, the United Kingdom has the highest per-capita incarceration rate in Western Europe.\nUK labour laws establish employment rights including a minimum wage, a minimum of 28 days annual holiday, parental leave, statutory sick pay and a pension. Same-sex marriage has been legal in England, Scotland, and Wales since 2014, and in Northern Ireland since 2020. LGBT equality in the United Kingdom is considered advanced by modern standards.\nSince leaving the EU most disputes under UK-EU agreements are addressed through consultation between the parties. If consultation fails to resolve the issue, either party can request arbitration, typically at the PCA in The Hague. The EU\u2013UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement states that the UK and EU have to cooperate and negotiate with each other with 'full mutual respect and good faith', as defined by international law. Under the Windsor Framework, Northern Ireland matters requiring interpretation of EU law go to the ECJ, though the Stormont Brake can prevent new EU rules from taking effect.\nMilitary.\nThe British Armed Forces consist of three professional service branches: the Royal Navy and Royal Marines (forming the Naval Service), the British Army and the Royal Air Force. The armed forces of the United Kingdom are managed by the Ministry of Defence and controlled by the Defence Council, chaired by the Secretary of State for Defence. The Commander-in-Chief is the British monarch, to whom members of the forces swear an oath of allegiance. \nThe armed forces are charged with protecting the UK and its overseas territories, promoting the UK's global security interests and supporting international peacekeeping efforts. They are active and regular participants in NATO (including the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps), the Five Power Defence Arrangements, RIMPAC and other worldwide coalition operations. Overseas garrisons and facilities are maintained in Ascension Island, Bahrain, Belize, Brunei, Canada, Cyprus, Diego Garcia, the Falkland Islands, Germany, Gibraltar, Kenya, Oman, Qatar and Singapore.\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute and the International Institute for Strategic Studies, the UK had the world's sixth- or fifth-highest military expenditures in 2024. Total defence spending in 2024 was estimated at 2.3 per cent of gross domestic product. Following the end of the Cold War, defence policy has a stated assumption that \"the most demanding operations\" will be undertaken as part of a coalition.\nEconomy.\nThe UK has a highly developed social market economy. With an estimated nominal GDP of \u00a32.765 trillion in 2024, it is the sixth-largest national economy in the world and the second-largest in Europe. Its currency, the pound sterling, is the fourth-most-traded currency in the foreign exchange market and the world's fourth-largest reserve currency, after the United States dollar, the euro and the yen. The pound sterling maintains its high nominal value through both its long history of stability and by never undergoing formal redenomination. Since 2022 the UK has been both the world's fourth-largest exporter and fourth-largest importer of goods and services. Despite having one of the highest levels of income inequality in the OECD, the UK has a very high HDI ranking, including when adjusted for inequality. As of 2025 the UK unemployment rate is 4.7%, which is moderately low by European standards.\nHM Treasury, led by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is responsible for developing and executing the government's public finance and economic policy. The Department for Business and Trade is responsible for business, international trade, and enterprise. The Bank of England is the UK's central bank and responsible for issuing notes and coins in the pound sterling. Banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland retain the right to issue their own notes, subject to retaining enough Bank of England notes in reserve to cover their issue. The Bank of England is exploring a digital pound to enable instant settlement and improve payment infrastructure.\nIndustries and services.\nThe service sector made up around 80 per cent of the UK's GVA in 2023. As of 2023 it is the world's second-largest exporter of services and in 2024 was the world's largest net exporter of financial services. In 2023 the UK was 13 per cent above its pre-pandemic and pre-Brexit peak in 2019 for service exports. London is the world capital for foreign exchange trading, with a market share of 38.1 per cent in 2022 of the daily US$7.5\u00a0trillion global turnover. It is the largest urban economy in Europe and, alongside New York, the city in the world most integrated with the global economy. London is also one of the world's leading financial centres, ranking second in the 2025 Global Financial Centres Index. Edinburgh, the UK's second-largest financial centre, ranks 29th in the world in the same index.\nThe UK's manufacturing sector in 2024 was the world's 10th-largest and Europe's fourth-largest by value output. Due to a period of high domestic inflation caused by COVID-19, high energy prices and supply chain shocks, the UK imported and exported less goods in 2023 than in 2018. At the end of 2024 manufacturing in the United Kingdom accounted for 8 per cent of the workforce and 8.6 per cent of national economic output. As reported in 2017 the East Midlands and West Midlands (at 12.6 and 11.8 per cent respectively) were the regions with the highest proportion of employees in manufacturing. London's manufacturing sector had the lowest at 2.8 per cent.\nThe country's tourism sector is important to the British economy; London was named Europe's most popular destination for 2022. The creative industries accounted for 5.9 per cent of the UK's GVA in 2019, having grown by 43.6 per cent in real terms from 2010. Creative industries contributed more than \u00a3111 billion to the UK economy in 2018, and the sector grew more than five times faster than the UK economy overall in that year. Lloyd's of London, located in London, is the world's largest insurance and reinsurance market. WPP plc is one of the world's biggest advertising companies and also based in London. The UK is one of Europe's leading retail markets and its largest e-commerce market. With consumption expenditures of over US$2 trillion in 2023, it has the second-largest consumer market in Europe. John Lewis is the UK's largest employee-owned business.\nThe British automotive industry generates \u00a347\u00a0billion of exports (12 per cent of the UK's total exports of goods). In 2024 the UK produced 779,584 passenger vehicles and 125,649 commercial vehicles; 8 out of 10 cars produced in the UK are exported overseas. Britain is known for iconic cars like Mini and Jaguar, as well as luxury cars such as Rolls-Royce, Bentley and Range Rover. The UK is a major centre for engine manufacturing: 1.59\u00a0million engines were produced in 2024. It was the world's third-largest exporter of engines in 2023. The UK motorsport industry employs more than 40,000 people, comprises around 4,300 companies and has an annual turnover of around \u00a310\u00a0billion. Seven of the ten Formula One teams are based in the UK, with their technology being used in supercars and hypercars from McLaren, Aston Martin and Lotus. In 2024 the UK surpassed Germany to become the largest market for electric vehicles in Europe.\nThe aerospace industry of the UK is the second-largest in the world and has an annual turnover of around \u00a330\u00a0billion. The UK space industry was worth \u00a317.5 billion in 2020/21 and employed around 48,800 people. Since 2012 the number of space organisations has grown on average nearly 21 per cent per year, with 1,293 organisations reported in 2021. The UK Space Agency has stated in 2023 that it is investing \u00a31.6\u00a0billion in space-related projects.\nThe British agriculture industry is intensive, highly mechanised and efficient by European standards, producing approximately 60 per cent of the country's overall food requirements and 73 per cent of its indigenous food needs, utilising around 0.9 per cent of the labour force (292,000 workers). Around two-thirds of production is devoted to livestock and one-third to arable crops. The UK retains a significant though much reduced fishing industry, with at least 49 per cent of UK fish sustainably caught in 2020. The UK marine natural capital assets were estimated to have a value of \u00a3211 billion in 2021. It is rich in a variety of other natural resources including coal, petroleum, natural gas, tin, limestone, iron ore, salt, clay, chalk, gypsum, lead, and silica and has an abundance of arable land.\nScience and technology.\nEngland and Scotland were leading centres of the Scientific Revolution from the 17th century. The United Kingdom led the Industrial Revolution from the 18th century, and has continued to produce scientists and engineers credited with important advances. Major theorists from the 17th and 18th centuries include Isaac Newton, whose laws of motion and illumination of gravity have been seen as a keystone of modern science; from the 19th century Charles Darwin, whose theory of evolution by natural selection was fundamental to the development of modern biology, and James Clerk Maxwell, who formulated classical electromagnetic theory; and more recently Stephen Hawking, who advanced major theories in the fields of cosmology, quantum gravity and the investigation of black holes.\nThe Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) is responsible for helping to develop and manage the UK's scientific, research, and technological outputs. Scientific research and development remains important in British universities, with many establishing science parks to facilitate production and co-operation with industry. During 2022 the UK produced 6.3 per cent of the world's scientific research papers and had a 10.5 per cent share of scientific citations, the third highest in the world for both. The UK ranked 1st in the world for Field-Weighted Citation Impact. Scientific journals produced in the UK include publications by the Royal Society, \"Nature\", the \"British Medical Journal\" and \"The Lancet\".\nBy 2024 the UK tech sector reached a value of US$1.2 trillion surpassing the combined values of the French and German sectors. Cambridge was named the number one university in the world for producing successful technology founders. The UK's artificial intelligence industry is the largest in Europe by value and the country ranked third globally in a 2024 report on artificial intelligence development by Stanford University. The UK ranked 6th in the 2025 Global Innovation Index. In 2025 the \"Tech Prosperity Deal\" was announced where US companies pledged \u00a3150 billion of investment in the UK.\nTransport.\nA radial road network totals of main roads, of motorways and of paved roads. The M25, encircling London, is the largest and busiest bypass in the world. In 2024 there were 41.7\u00a0million licensed vehicles in the UK.\nThe UK has an extensive railway network of . In Great Britain, the British Rail network was privatised between 1994 and 1997, followed by a rapid rise in passengers. Great British Railways is a planned state-owned public body that will oversee rail transport in Great Britain. The UK was ranked eighth amongst national European rail systems in the 2017 European Railway Performance Index assessing intensity of use, quality of service and safety.\nThe UK has a train direct from London to Paris; called the Eurostar, it travels through the Channel Tunnel under the English Channel, at 23.5\u00a0miles long it is the world's longest undersea tunnel. There is also a car service through the tunnel to France called LeShuttle. The Elizabeth line, a rail link running between East and West London, was named in honour of Queen Elizabeth II in 2016 and opened in 2022. It was Europe's largest construction project at the time and is estimated to bring in \u00a342\u00a0billion to the UK economy. Another major infrastructure project is High Speed 2 (HS2), a high-speed railway under construction since 2019. It will link London with Birmingham, with the potential to extend further north and capable of speeds of up to 225\u00a0mph.\nIn 2023 there were 4 billion bus journeys in the UK, 1.8 billion of which were in London. The red double-decker bus has entered popular culture as an internationally recognised icon of London and England. The London bus network is extensive, with over 6,800 scheduled services every weekday carrying about 6\u00a0million passengers on over 700 different routes, making it one of the most extensive bus systems in the world and the largest in Europe.\nDuring 2024 British airports handled nearly 292.5 million passengers. In that period the three largest airports were London Heathrow Airport (83.9 million passengers), Gatwick Airport (43.2 million passengers) and Manchester Airport (30.8 million passengers). London Heathrow Airport, located west of the capital, is the world's second-busiest airport by international passenger traffic and has the most international passenger traffic of any airport in the world; it is the hub for the UK flag carrier British Airways, as well as Virgin Atlantic. During 2023, 18.3 million passengers travelled internationally by rail and 18.1 million by sea.\nEnergy.\nIn 2021 the UK was the world's 14th-largest consumer and 22nd-largest producer of energy. It is home to many large energy companies, including two of the six major oil and gas companies\u00a0\u2013 BP and Shell.\nRenewable electricity sources provided 51 per cent of the electricity generated in the UK in 2024. Wind power was the largest source of electricity in 2024, generating 30 per cent of the UK's total electricity. The UK has the largest offshore wind farm in the world, which is located off the coast of Yorkshire.\nIn 2023 the UK had nine nuclear reactors generating about 15 per cent of the UK's electricity. There are two reactors under construction and more planned. In the late 1990s nuclear power plants contributed around 25 per cent of the total annual electricity generation in the UK, but this has gradually declined as old plants have been shut down. The UK government is investing in small modular reactors that operate via nuclear fission, as well as in research and development towards commercial fusion reactors. To that end the government entered into a partnership with the US in late 2023 to collaborate on fusion technology, with \"a commercial grid-ready fusion reactor by 2040\" stated as a goal.\nAt the end of 2023 it was estimated that there were 1.1\u00a0billion barrels of oil equivalent of \"proven\" and \"probable\" gas reserves and 2.3\u00a0billion boe of \"proven\" and \"probable\" oil reserves offshore, reducing reliance on imports for energy security and transitioning to renewables. Emissions from UK gas production are roughly four times lower than imported liquefied natural gas (LNG), according to the UK's oil and gas regulator.\nIn September 2024 the last coal power station was closed, making coal no longer a power source in the UK. The UK currently has no fracking (hydraulic fracturing) for shale gas despite a large supply, due to environmental concerns.\nWater supply and sanitation.\nAccess to improved water supply and sanitation in the UK is universal. It is estimated that 96 per cent of households are connected to the sewer network. According to the Environment Agency, total water abstraction for public water supply in the UK was 16,406 megalitres per day in 2007.\nIn England and Wales, water and sewerage services are provided by 10 private regional water and sewerage companies and 13 mostly smaller private \"water only\" companies. In Scotland, said services are provided by a single public company, Scottish Water. In Northern Ireland, they are also provided by a single public entity, Northern Ireland Water.\nDemographics.\nIn the 2021 census the population of the United Kingdom was 67,026,292. It is the fourth-largest in Europe and the 22nd-largest in the world. In 2012 and 2013 births contributed the most to population growth, while in 2014 and 2015 net international migration contributed more. Between 2001 and 2011 the population increased at an average annual rate of 0.7 per cent. The 2011 census also showed that, over the previous 100 years, the proportion of the population aged 0\u201314 fell from 31 to 18 per cent, and the proportion of people aged 65 and over rose from 5 to 16 per cent. In 2018 the median age of the UK population was 41.7 years. The 2021 census put Scotland's population at 5.48\u00a0million, Wales's at 3.1\u00a0million and Northern Ireland's at 1.9\u00a0million.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nEngland's population in 2021 was 56\u00a0million, representing some 84 per cent of the UK total. England is one of the most-densely-populated countries in the world, with 434\u00a0people per square kilometre in mid-2021, with a particular concentration in London and the south-east. London's wider metropolitan area is the largest in Western Europe, with a population of 14.9\u00a0million in 2024.\nIn 2021 the total fertility rate across the UK was 1.53 children born per woman, which remains considerably below the baby boom peak of 2.95 children per woman in 1964, or the high of 6.02 children born per woman in 1815 and below the replacement rate of 2.1. In 2011, 47.3 per cent of births in the UK were to unmarried women. The Office for National Statistics reported in 2015 that amongst the UK population aged 16 and over, 1.7 per cent identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual (2.0 per cent of males and 1.5 per cent of females); 4.5 per cent of respondents responded with \"other\", \"I don't know\", or did not respond. The number of transgender people in the UK was estimated to be between 65,000 and 300,000 by research between 2001 and 2008.\nEthnicity.\nHistorically, indigenous British people were thought to be descended from ethnic groups that settled there before the 12th century: the Celts, Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Norse and the Normans. Welsh people could be the oldest ethnic group in the UK. The UK has a history of non-white immigration with Liverpool having the oldest black population in the country dating from at least the 1730s, in addition to having the oldest Chinese community in Europe dating from the 19th century. \nIn 2021, 83 per cent of the UK population identified themselves as white, meaning 17 per cent of the UK population identify themselves as of one of an ethnic minority group. Ethnic diversity varies significantly across the UK. Regionally, in 2021, 46.2 per cent of London's population was an ethnic minority, comparatively to Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the South West and North East of England being less than 10 per cent.\nLanguage.\nThe English language is the \"de facto\" official and most widely spoken language in the United Kingdom. The UK promotes the language globally to build connections, understanding and trust between people in the UK and countries worldwide.\nIn the UK, the English language is spoken with distinctive characteristics that collectively form what is known as British English. The variety of dialects and accents is often noted, with nearby regions frequently having highly distinct variations. Received Pronunciation is traditionally associated with educated speakers in southern England. The main national dialects are Scottish English, Welsh English and Northern Irish English. Distinctive regional varieties include\nBrummie, Cockney, Geordie, Mancunian, Scouse, West Country, Yorkshire and MLE (Multicultural London English).\nThree indigenous Celtic languages are spoken in the UK: Welsh, Irish and Scottish Gaelic. Cornish, which became extinct as a first language in the late-18th century, is being revived and has a small group of second-language speakers. In the 2021 census the Welsh-speaking population of Wales aged three or older was 538,300 (17.8 per cent). In addition it is estimated that about 200,000 Welsh-speakers live in England. In the 2021 census in Northern Ireland 12.4 per cent of people had some Irish language ability and 10.4 per cent of people had some facility in the Ulster-Scots language. \nIn 2001, over 92,000 people in Scotland, just under 2 per cent of the population, had some Gaelic language ability, including 72 per cent of those living in the Outer Hebrides. The number of children being taught either Welsh or Scottish Gaelic is increasing. Scots, a language descended from early northern Middle English, has limited recognition alongside its regional variant, Ulster Scots in Northern Ireland, without specific commitments to protection and promotion. As of April 2020 there are around 151,000 users of British Sign Language (BSL), a sign language used by deaf people, in the UK.\nIn 2013, it was estimated that 95 per cent of the UK's population were monolingual English speakers. In 2013, over 5 per cent of the population were estimated to speak languages brought to the UK as a result of immigration. South Asian languages are the largest group, which includes Punjabi, Urdu, Bengali, Sylheti, Hindi, Pahari-Pothwari, Tamil and Gujarati. In the 2011 census Polish was the second-largest language spoken in England, with 546,000 speakers. In 2019 some three-quarters of a million people spoke little or no English.\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChristianity has dominated religious life in the United Kingdom for more than 1,400 years. Although a majority of citizens still identify with Christianity in surveys, regular church attendance has fallen dramatically since the middle of the 20th century, while immigration and demographic change have contributed to the growth of Islam and other faiths. This has led some commentators to describe the UK as a multi-faith, secularised, or post-Christian society.\nIn the 2021 census 46.5 per cent of respondents reported that they were Christians, with the next largest faiths being Islam (5.9 per cent), Hinduism (1.6 per cent), Sikhism (0.8 per cent), Buddhism (0.4 per cent), Judaism (0.4 per cent), and all other religions (0.6 per cent). Of the respondents, 38 per cent stated that they had no religion and a further 6 per cent stated no religious preference. A Tearfund survey in 2007 showed that one Briton in ten attends church weekly. Between the 2001 and 2011 censuses there was a 12 per cent decrease in those who identified as Christian, while the percentage reporting no religious affiliation doubled. This contrasted with growth in the other main religious group categories, with the number of Muslims increasing the most to about 5 per cent. The Muslim population has increased from 1.6\u00a0million in 2001 to 2.7\u00a0million in 2011, making it the second-largest religious group in the UK.\nThe Church of England is the established church. It retains representation in the UK Parliament, and the British monarch is its Supreme Governor. In Scotland the Church of Scotland is the national church. It is not subject to state control, and the British monarch is an ordinary member, required to swear an oath to \"maintain and preserve the Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Government\" upon his or her accession. The Church in Wales was disestablished in 1920 and, because the Church of Ireland was disestablished in 1870 before the partition of Ireland, there is no established church in Northern Ireland. Although there are no UK-wide data in the 2001 census on adherence to individual Christian denominations, it has been estimated that 62 per cent of Christians are Anglican, 13.5 per cent Catholic, 6 per cent Presbyterian, and 3.4 per cent Methodist, with smaller numbers of other denominations.\nMigration.\nImmigration is contributing to a rising UK population, with arrivals and UK-born children of migrants accounting for about half of the population increase between 1991 and 2001. According to statistics released in 2015, 27 per cent of UK live births in 2014 were to mothers born outside the UK. \nIn 2013 approximately 208,000 foreign nationals were naturalised as British citizens, the highest number since 1962. This figure fell to around 125,800 in 2014. Between 2009 and 2013 the average number of British citizenships granted annually was 195,800. The most common origins of those naturalised in 2024 were Pakistani, Indian, Nigerian, Filipino, Bangladeshi, Italian, Turkish, Romanian and Iranian. The number of grants of settlement, which confer permanent residence in the UK but not citizenship, was approximately 154,700 in 2013, higher than the previous two years. Long-term net migration (the number of people immigrating minus the number emigrating) reached a record of 860,000 in 2023, with immigration at 1.326\u00a0million and emigration at 466,000. In comparison, in 2024 net migration was estimated to be 431,000 with immigration at 948,000 and emigration at 517,000.\nEmigration was an important feature of British society in the 19th century. Between 1815 and 1930, around 11.4\u00a0million people emigrated from Britain and 7.3\u00a0million from Ireland. Estimates show that by the end of the 20th century, some 300\u00a0million people of British and Irish descent were permanently settled around the globe. In 2006 at least 5.5\u00a0million UK-born people lived abroad, mainly in Australia, Spain, the United States and Canada.\nEducation.\nEducation in the United Kingdom is a devolved matter, with each country having a separate education system. About 38 per cent of the United Kingdom population has a university or college degree, the highest percentage in Europe and one of the highest in the world. The UK is home to many universities, including the University of Oxford and University of Cambridge, which often achieve first place on global rankings.\nUniversity education has varied tuition fees in different regions of the UK. England and Wales have a fixed maximum annual fee for all UK citizens, contingent on attaining a certain level of income. Only those who reach a certain salary threshold pay this fee through general taxation. Northern Ireland and Scotland have a reduced maximum fee or no fee for citizens where it is their home region. Some NHS courses have bursaries which pay the fee and in 2017 it was stated that each doctor gets subsidised by \u00a3230,000 during their training.\nIn 2022 the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), coordinated by the OECD, ranked the overall knowledge and skills of British 15-year-olds as 14th in the world in reading, mathematics and science. The average British student scored 494, above the OECD average of 478.\nHealthcare.\nThe modern system of universal publicly funded healthcare in the United Kingdom has its origins in the creation of the National Health Service (NHS) in 1949 is the primary healthcare provider in the United Kingdom. The widespread popularity of the NHS has led to it being described as a \"national religion\". Healthcare in the United Kingdom is a devolved matter and each constituent country has its own system of universal publicly funded healthcare, although private healthcare is also available. Public healthcare is provided to all UK permanent residents and is mostly free at the point of need, being paid for from general taxation. The World Health Organization, in 2000, ranked the provision of healthcare in the United Kingdom as fifteenth-best in Europe and eighteenth in the world.\nSince 1979 expenditure on healthcare has increased significantly. The 2018 OECD data, which incorporates in health a chunk of what in the UK is classified as social care, has the UK spending \u00a33,121 per person. In 2017 the UK spent \u00a32,989 per person on healthcare, near the median for members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\nRegulatory bodies are organised on a UK-wide basis such as the General Medical Council, the Nursing and Midwifery Council and non-governmental-based, such as the Royal Colleges. Political and operational responsibility for healthcare lies with four national executives; healthcare in England is the responsibility of the UK Government; healthcare in Northern Ireland is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive; healthcare in Scotland is the responsibility of the Scottish Government; and healthcare in Wales is the responsibility of the Welsh Government. Each National Health Service has different policies and priorities.\nCulture.\nThe culture of the United Kingdom is influenced by the nation's island status, its history, and being a political union of four countries with each preserving distinctive traditions, customs and symbolism. British influence can be observed in the language, culture and legal systems of many of its former colonies, in particular, the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Ireland, a common culture known as the Anglosphere. The UK's soft power influence has led to the country being described as a cultural superpower. A global survey in 2024 ranked the UK 3rd in the 'Most Influential Countries' rankings, behind the US and China.\nLiterature.\nBritish literature includes that associated with the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. Most British literature is in English. In 2022, 669\u00a0million physical books were sold in the UK, the most ever. Britain is renowned for children's literature; writers include Daniel Defoe, Rudyard Kipling, Lewis Carroll and Beatrix Potter, who also illustrated her own books. Other writers include A. A. Milne, Enid Blyton, J. R. R. Tolkien, Roald Dahl, Terry Pratchett and J. K. Rowling, who wrote \"Harry Potter\", the best-selling book series of all time.\nThe playwright and poet William Shakespeare is generally regarded as the greatest dramatist ever and the national poet of England. Other important figures in the literature of England are Geoffrey Chaucer, known for \"The Canterbury Tales\", the poet William Wordsworth, and other Romantic poets, also the novelists Charles Dickens, H. G. Wells, George Orwell, Aldous Huxley and Ian Fleming. The 20th-century English crime writer Agatha Christie is the best-selling novelist in history. Twelve of the top 25 of 100 novels by British writers chosen by a BBC poll of global critics were written by women; these included works by George Eliot, Virginia Woolf, Charlotte Bront\u00eb, Emily Bront\u00eb, Mary Shelley, Jane Austen, Doris Lessing and Zadie Smith.\nScottish literature includes Arthur Conan Doyle (the creator of Sherlock Holmes), Sir Walter Scott, J. M. Barrie, Robert Louis Stevenson (whose novel \"Treasure Island\" strongly influenced the portrayal of pirates in the arts and popular culture), and the poet Robert Burns, who is considered the national poet of Scotland. More recently Hugh MacDiarmid and Neil M. Gunn contributed to the Scottish Renaissance, with grimmer works from Ian Rankin and Iain Banks. Edinburgh was UNESCO's first worldwide City of Literature.\nWelsh literature includes Britain's oldest known poem, \"Y Gododdin\", most likely composed in the late 6th century. It was written in Cumbric or Old Welsh and contains the earliest known reference to King Arthur. The Arthurian legend was further developed by Geoffrey of Monmouth. Dafydd ap Gwilym (\"fl.\"\u00a01320\u20131370) is widely regarded as one of the greatest European poets of his age. Daniel Owen is credited as the first Welsh-language novelist, publishing \"Rhys Lewis\" in 1885. The best-known of the Anglo-Welsh poets are Dylan Thomas and R. S. Thomas, the latter nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1996. Leading Welsh novelists of the twentieth century include Richard Llewellyn and Kate Roberts.\nNorthern Ireland's most popular writer is C. S. Lewis, who was born in Belfast and wrote \"The Chronicles of Narnia\". Irish writers, living at a time when all of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom, include Oscar Wilde, Bram Stoker (who wrote \"Dracula\") and George Bernard Shaw. There have been many authors whose origins were from outside the United Kingdom but who moved to the UK, including Joseph Conrad, T. S. Eliot, Kazuo Ishiguro, Sir Salman Rushdie and Ezra Pound.\nPhilosophy.\nThe United Kingdom is famous for \"British Empiricism\", a branch of the philosophy that states that only knowledge verified by experience is valid, and 'Scottish Philosophy', sometimes referred to as the 'Scottish School of Common Sense'. The most famous philosophers of British Empiricism are John Locke, George Berkeley and David Hume; while Dugald Stewart, Thomas Reid and William Hamilton were major exponents of the Scottish \"common sense\" school. Two Britons are also notable for the ethical theory of utilitarianism, a moral philosophy first used by Jeremy Bentham and later by John Stuart Mill in his short work \"Utilitarianism\".\nMusic.\nVarious styles of music have become popular in the UK, including the folk music of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. English folk features melodic ballads with strong lyrics and music for country dancing often using accordion and fiddles. Scottish folk features bagpipes and fiddles playing traditional dance tunes with bouncy tempos. Welsh folk has harps and vocal harmonies often sung in Welsh. Northern Irish folk blends fiddles with flutes merging Scottish and Irish influences.\nHistorically, there has been Renaissance music from the Tudor period, with masses, madrigals and lute music by Thomas Tallis, John Taverner, William Byrd, Orlando Gibbons and John Dowland. After the Stuart Restoration, an English tradition of dramatic masques, anthems and airs became established, led by Henry Purcell, followed by Thomas Arne and others. George Frideric Handel composed the anthem \"Zadok the Priest\" for the coronation of George II; it became the traditional ceremonial music for anointing all future monarchs. Handel's many oratorios, such as his famous \"Messiah\", were written in English. \nIn the second half of the 19th century, Arthur Sullivan and his librettist W. S. Gilbert wrote their popular Savoy operas, and Edward Elgar composed a wide range of music. Increasingly, composers became inspired by the English countryside and its folk music, notably Gustav Holst, Ralph Vaughan Williams and Benjamin Britten, a pioneer of modern British opera. Amongst the many post-war composers, some of the most notable have made their own personal choice of musical identity: Peter Maxwell Davies (Orkney), Harrison Birtwistle (mythological), and John Tavener (religious). Recent classical singers include Alfie Boe, Bryn Terfel, Katherine Jenkins, Michael Ball, Roderick Williams, Russell Watson and Sarah Brightman, while Nicola Benedetti and Nigel Kennedy are renowned for their violin ability.\nAccording to \"The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians\" the term \"pop music\" originated in Britain in the mid-1950s to describe rock and roll's fusion with the \"new youth music\". \"The Oxford Dictionary of Music\" states that artists such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones drove pop music to the forefront of popular music in the early 1960s. Birmingham became known as the birthplace of heavy metal, with the band Black Sabbath starting there in the 1960s. In the following years, Britain took part in the development of rock music, with British acts pioneering hard rock, raga rock, heavy metal, space rock, glam rock, Gothic rock, psychedelic rock and punk rock. British acts also developed neo soul and created dubstep. The modern UK produces some of the most prominent English-speaking rappers along with the United States, including Stormzy, Kano, Yxng Bane, Ramz, Little Simz and Skepta.\nThe Beatles have international sales of over 1\u00a0billion units and are the biggest-selling band, in addition to being widely regarded as the most influential band in the history of popular music. Other prominent British contributors to popular music over the last 50 years include the Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Queen, Led Zeppelin, the Bee Gees and Elton John, all of whom have worldwide record sales of 200\u00a0million or more. The Brit Awards are the BPI's annual music awards, and some of the British recipients of the Outstanding Contribution to Music award include the Who, David Bowie, Eric Clapton, Rod Stewart, the Police and Fleetwood Mac (who are a British-American band). More recent UK music acts that have had international success include George Michael, Oasis, Spice Girls, Radiohead, Coldplay, Arctic Monkeys, Robbie Williams, Amy Winehouse, Susan Boyle, Adele, Ed Sheeran, Lewis Capaldi, One Direction, Harry Styles and Dua Lipa. As of 2024 the UK is the world's third-largest music market behind the US and Japan, and in 2021 was the second-largest exporter of music behind the US.\nMany British cities are known for their music. Acts from Liverpool have had 54 UK chart number 1 hit singles, more per capita than any other city worldwide. Glasgow's contribution was recognised in 2008 when it was named a City of Music by UNESCO. Manchester played a role in the spread of dance music such as acid house, and from the mid-1990s, Britpop. London and Bristol are closely associated with the origins of electronic music sub-genres such as drum and bass and trip hop.\nUK dance music traces its roots back to the black British Sound System Culture and the New Age Traveller movement of the 60s and 70s, it also has influences from the Chicago House and Detroit Techno scenes. In the late 80's, dance music exploded with Rave culture mainly Acid House tracks which were made mainstream with novelty records (such as Smart E's Sesame's Treet and the Prodigy's Charly) and the Balearic sound brought back from the Ibiza club scene. This led on to genres such as UK Garage, Speed Garage, Drum and bass, Jungle, Trance, and Dubstep. Influential UK dance acts past and present include 808 State, Orbital, the Prodigy, Underworld, Roni Size, Leftfield, Massive Attack, Groove Armada, Fatboy Slim, Faithless, Basement Jaxx, Chemical Brothers, Sub Focus, Chase &amp; Status, Disclosure, Calvin Harris, and Fred Again. Other influential UK DJs include Judge Jules, Pete Tong, Carl Cox, Paul Oakenfold, John Digweed and Sasha.\nVisual art.\nMajor British artists include the Romantic artists William Blake, John Constable, Samuel Palmer, and J. M. W. Turner; the portrait painters Sir Joshua Reynolds and Lucian Freud; the landscape artists Thomas Gainsborough and L. S. Lowry; the pioneer of the Arts and Crafts movement William Morris; the figurative painter Francis Bacon; the Pop artists Peter Blake, Richard Hamilton and David Hockney; the pioneers of conceptual art movement Art &amp; Language; the collaborative duo Gilbert and George; the abstract artist Howard Hodgkin; and the sculptors Antony Gormley, Anish Kapoor and Henry Moore. During the late 1980s and 1990s the Saatchi Gallery in London helped to bring to public attention a group of multi-genre artists who would become known as the \"Young British Artists\": Damien Hirst, Chris Ofili, Rachel Whiteread, Tracey Emin, Mark Wallinger, Steve McQueen, Sam Taylor-Wood and the Chapman Brothers are amongst the better-known members of this loosely affiliated movement.\nThe Royal Academy in London is a key organisation for the promotion of the visual arts in the United Kingdom. Major schools of art in the UK include: the six-school University of the Arts London, which includes the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and Chelsea College of Art and Design; Goldsmiths, University of London; the Slade School of Fine Art (part of University College London); the Glasgow School of Art; the Royal College of Art; and The Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art (part of the University of Oxford). The Courtauld Institute of Art is a leading centre for the teaching of the history of art. Important art galleries in the United Kingdom include the National Gallery, National Portrait Gallery, Tate Britain, and Tate Modern (the most-visited modern art gallery in the world, with around 4.7\u00a0million visitors per year).\nCinema.\nThe United Kingdom has had a considerable influence on the history of the cinema. The British directors Alfred Hitchcock, whose film \"Vertigo\" is considered by some critics as the best film of all time, and David Lean, who directed \"Lawrence of Arabia\", are amongst the most critically acclaimed directors ever. Recent popular directors include Christopher Nolan, Sam Mendes, Steve McQueen, Richard Curtis, Danny Boyle, Tony Scott and Ridley Scott. Many British actors have achieved international fame and critical success. Some of the most commercially successful films have been produced in the United Kingdom, including two of the highest-grossing film franchises (\"Harry Potter\" and \"James Bond\").\n2019 was a particularly good year for British films which grossed around \u00a310.3\u00a0billion globally, accounting for 28.7 per cent of global box office revenue. UK box-office takings totalled \u00a31.25\u00a0billion in 2019, with around 176\u00a0million admissions. In 2023 UK film and television studio stage space stood at 6.9\u00a0million sq ft, with 1\u00a0million sq ft added in the past year with more in development. The annual BAFTA Film Awards are hosted by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.\nCuisine.\nBritish cuisine developed from influences reflective of its land, settlements, arrivals of new settlers and immigrants, trade and colonialism. The food of England has historically been characterised by simplicity of approach and a reliance on the high quality of natural produce. The traditional Sunday roast is one example, featuring a roast joint (usually of beef), lamb, chicken, or pork, often free range (and generally grass-fed, in the case of beef). Roasts are served with either roasted or boiled vegetables, Yorkshire pudding and gravy. Other traditional meals include meat pies and stews. A poll by YouGov in 2019 rated classic British food, with more than 80 per cent liking the Sunday roast, Yorkshire pudding, fish and chips, crumpets and the full English breakfast.\nThe UK is home to a large selection of fine dining. In 2025 there were 197 restaurants with a Michelin Star; 55 of them consider their cuisine to be 'Modern British'. Sweet foods are common within British cuisine, and there is a long list of British desserts. Afternoon tea is a light afternoon meal served with tea in tea rooms and hotels around the United Kingdom, with the tradition dating back to around 1840. A poll from July 2024 revealed that 3 per cent of the UK population follow a vegan diet, 6 per cent are vegetarian, and 13 per cent identify as flexitarian (following a mainly vegetarian diet). The British Empire facilitated knowledge of Indian cuisine with its \"strong, penetrating spices and herbs\". British cuisine has absorbed the cultural influence of those who have settled in Britain, producing hybrid dishes, such as chicken tikka masala. The British have embraced world cuisine and regularly eat recipes or fast food from other European countries, the Caribbean and Asia.\nThe UK has many gastropubs and is the birthplace of many alcoholic drinks including several beer styles such as pale ale, India pale ale, bitter, brown ale, porter, and stout. The number of craft beers and microbreweries has expanded rapidly in the last two decades. Other popular alcoholic drinks produced in the UK include Scotch whisky, English wine, gin, perry and cider.\nMedia.\nThe BBC, founded in 1922, is the UK's publicly funded radio, television and Internet broadcasting corporation, and is the oldest and largest broadcaster in the world. It operates television and radio stations across the UK and abroad and its domestic services are funded by the television licence. The BBC World Service is an international broadcaster owned and operated by the BBC, and the world's largest. It broadcasts radio news, speech and discussions in more than 40 languages.\nOther major players in the UK media include ITV, which operates 11 of the 15 regional television broadcasters that make up the ITV Network, and Sky. Newspapers produced in the United Kingdom include the \"Daily Mail\", \"The Guardian\", \"The Telegraph\", \"The Times\", and the \"Financial Times\". Magazines and journals published in the United Kingdom that have achieved worldwide circulation include \"The Spectator\", \"The Economist\", \"New Statesman\" and \"Radio Times\".\nLondon dominates the media sector in the UK: national newspapers and television and radio are largely based there, although MediaCityUK in Manchester is also a significant national media centre. Edinburgh and Glasgow, and Cardiff, are important centres of newspaper and broadcasting production in Scotland and Wales, respectively. The UK publishing sector, including books, directories and databases, journals, magazines and business media, newspapers and news agencies, has a combined turnover of around \u00a320\u00a0billion and employs 167,000 people. In 2015 the UK published 2,710 book titles per million inhabitants, more than any other country, with much of this exported to other Anglophone countries.\nIn 2010, 82.5 per cent of the UK population were Internet users, the highest proportion amongst the 20 countries with the largest total number of users in that year. The British video game industry is the largest in Europe, and since 2022 the UK has the largest video game market in Europe by sales, surpassing Germany. It is the world's third-largest producer of video games after Japan and the United States.\nSport.\nAssociation football, tennis, table tennis, badminton, rugby union, rugby league, rugby sevens, golf, boxing, netball, water polo, field hockey, billiards, darts, rowing, rounders and cricket originated or were substantially developed in the UK, with the rules and codes of many modern sports invented and codified in the Victorian era.\nA poll in 2003 found that football is the most popular sport in the UK. England is recognised by FIFA as the birthplace of club football, and the Football Association is the oldest of its kind, with the rules of football first drafted in 1863 by Ebenezer Cobb Morley. Each of the Home Nations (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) has its own football association, national team and league system, and each is individually a governing member of the International Football Association Board alongside FIFA. The English top division, the Premier League, is the most watched football league in the world. The first international football match was contested by England and Scotland on 30\u00a0November 1872. England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland usually compete as separate countries in international competitions.\nIn 2003 rugby union was ranked the second-most-popular sport in the UK. The sport was created in Rugby School, Warwickshire, and the first rugby international took place on 27\u00a0March 1871 between England and Scotland. England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, France and Italy compete in the Six Nations Championship, the premier international rugby union tournament in the northern hemisphere. Sports governing bodies in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland organise and regulate the game separately. Every four years the Home Nations make a combined team known as the British and Irish Lions which tours Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.\nThe United Kingdom hosted the Summer Olympic Games in 1908, 1948 and 2012, with London acting as the host city on all three occasions. Birmingham hosted the 2022 Commonwealth Games, the seventh time a country of the United Kingdom hosted the Commonwealth Games (England, Scotland and Wales have each hosted the Commonwealth Games at least once).\nSymbols.\nThe flag of the United Kingdom is the Union Flag, which is also referred to as the Union Jack. It was created in 1606 by the superimposition of the flag of England, representing Saint George, on the flag of Scotland, representing Saint Andrew, and was updated in 1801 with the addition of Saint Patrick's Flag. Wales is not represented in the Union Flag, as Wales had been conquered and annexed to England prior to the formation of the United Kingdom. The possibility of redesigning the Union Flag to include representation of Wales was discussed in 2007. The national anthem of the United Kingdom is \"God Save the King\", with \"King\" replaced with \"Queen\" in the lyrics whenever the monarch is a woman.\nBritannia is a national personification of the United Kingdom, originating from Roman Britain. Beside The Lion and the Unicorn and the dragon of heraldry, the bulldog is an iconic animal and commonly represented with the Union Flag. A rare personification is a character originating in the 18th century, John Bull.\nEngland, Wales and Scotland each have their own national symbols, including their national flags. Northern Ireland also has symbols, many of which are shared with the Republic of Ireland.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31718", "revid": "50584560", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31718", "title": "Utopia", "text": "Imaginary community with desirable qualities\nA utopia ( ) typically describes an imagined community or society that possesses highly desirable or near-perfect qualities for its members. It was coined by Sir Thomas More for his 1516 book \"Utopia\", which describes a fictional island society in the New World.\nHypothetical utopias and actually-existing utopian intentional communities focus on, among other things, equality in categories such as economics, government and justice, with the method and structure of proposed implementation varying according to ideology. Lyman Tower Sargent argues that the nature of a utopia is inherently contradictory because societies are not homogeneous. Their members have desires that conflict and therefore cannot simultaneously be satisfied. To quote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There are socialist, capitalist, monarchical, democratic, anarchist, ecological, feminist, patriarchal, egalitarian, hierarchical, racist, left-wing, right-wing, reformist, free love, nuclear family, extended family, gay, lesbian and many more utopias [ Naturism, Nude Christians, ...] Utopianism, some argue, is essential for the improvement of the human condition. But if used wrongly, it becomes dangerous. Utopia has an inherent contradictory nature here.\n\u2014\u200aThe opposite of a utopia is a dystopia. Utopian and dystopian fiction has become a popular literary category. Despite being common parlance for something imaginary, utopianism inspired and was inspired by some reality-based fields and concepts such as architecture, file sharing, social networks, universal basic income, communes, open borders and even pirate bases.\nEtymology and history.\nThe word was coined in 1516 from Ancient Greek by the Englishman Sir Thomas More for his Latin text \"Utopia\". It literally translates as \"no place\", coming from the (\"not\") and \u03c4\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 (\"place\"), and meant any non-existent society, when 'described in considerable detail'. However, in standard usage, the word's meaning has shifted and now usually describes a non-existent society that is intended to be viewed \"as considerably better\" than contemporary society.\nIn his original work, More carefully pointed out the similarity of the word to \"eutopia\", meaning \"good place\", from (\"good\" or \"well\") and \u03c4\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 (\"place\"), which ostensibly would be the more appropriate term for the concept in modern English. The pronunciations of \"eutopia\" and \"utopia\" in English are identical, which may have given rise to the change in meaning. \"Dystopia\", a term meaning \"bad place\" coined in 1868, draws on this latter meaning. The opposite of a utopia, \"dystopia\" is a concept which surpassed \"utopia\" in popularity in the fictional literature from the 1950s onwards, chiefly because of the impact of George Orwell's \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\".\nIn 1876, writer Charles Renouvier published a novel called \"Uchronia\" (French \"Uchronie\"). The neologism, using \"chronos\" instead of \"topos\", has since been used to refer to non-existent idealized times in fiction, such as Philip Roth's \"The Plot Against America\" (2004)\",\" and Philip K. Dick's \"The Man in the High Castle\" (1962)\".\"\nAccording to the \"Philosophical Dictionary\", proto-utopian ideas begin as early as the period of ancient Greece and Rome, medieval heretics, peasant revolts and establish themselves in the period of the early capitalism, reformation and Renaissance (Hus, M\u00fcntzer, More, Campanella), democratic revolutions (Meslier, Morelly, Mably, Winstanley, later Babeufists, Blanquists,) and in a period of turbulent development of capitalism that highlighted antagonisms of capitalist society (Saint-Simon, Fourier, Owen, Cabet, Lamennais, Proudhon and their followers).\nDefinitions and interpretations.\nFamous quotes from writers and characters about utopia:\nUtopian socialist \u00c9tienne Cabet in his utopian book \"The Voyage to Icaria\" cited the definition from the contemporary \"Dictionary of ethical and political sciences\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Utopias and other models of government, based on the public good, may be inconceivable because of the disordered human passions which, under the wrong governments, seek to highlight the poorly conceived or selfish interest of the community. But even though we find it impossible, they are ridiculous to sinful people whose sense of self-destruction prevents them from believing.\nMarx and Engels used the word \"utopia\" to denote unscientific social theories.\nPhilosopher Slavoj \u017di\u017eek told about utopia:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Which means that we should reinvent utopia but in what sense. There are two false meanings of utopia one is this old notion of imagining this ideal society we know will never be realized, the other is the capitalist utopia in the sense of new perverse desire that you are not only allowed but even solicited to realize. The true utopia is when the situation is so without issue, without the way to resolve it within the coordinates of the possible that out of the pure urge of survival you have to invent a new space. Utopia is not kind of a free imagination utopia is a matter of inner most urgency, you are forced to imagine it, it is the only way out, and this is what we need today.\nPhilosopher Milan \u0160ime\u010dka said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...utopism was a common type of thinking at the dawn of human civilization. We find utopian beliefs in the oldest religious imaginations, appear regularly in the neighborhood of ancient, yet pre-philosophical views on the causes and meaning of natural events, the purpose of creation, the path of good and evil, happiness and misfortune, fairy tales and legends later inspired by poetry and philosophy ... the underlying motives on which utopian literature is built are as old as the entire historical epoch of human history.\nPhilosopher Richard Stahel said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...every social organization relies on something that is not realized or feasible, but has the ideal that is somewhere beyond the horizon, a lighthouse to which it may seek to approach if it considers that ideal socially valid and generally accepted.\nVarieties.\nChronologically, the first recorded Utopian proposal is Plato's \"Republic\". Part conversation, part fictional depiction and part policy proposal, the \"Republic\" sets out a system that would categorize citizens into a rigid class structure of \"golden\", \"silver\", \"bronze\" and \"iron\" socioeconomic classes. The golden citizens are trained in a rigorous 50-year-long educational program to be benign oligarchs, the \"philosopher-kings\". Plato stressed this structure many times in statements, and in the \"Republic\" and other published works. The wisdom of these rulers will supposedly eliminate poverty and deprivation through fairly distributed resources, though the details on how to do this are unclear. The educational program for the rulers is the central notion of the proposal. It has few laws, no lawyers and rarely sends its citizens to war but hires mercenaries from among its war-prone neighbors. These mercenaries were deliberately sent into dangerous situations in the hope that the more warlike populations of all surrounding countries will be weeded out, leaving peaceful peoples to remain.\nDuring the 16th century, Thomas More's book \"Utopia\" proposed an ideal society of the same name. Readers, including Utopian socialists, have chosen to accept this imaginary society as the realistic blueprint for a working nation, while others have postulated that Thomas More intended nothing of the sort. It is believed that More's \"Utopia\" functions only on the level of a satire, a work intended to reveal more about the England of his time than about an idealistic society. This interpretation is bolstered by the title of the book and nation and its apparent confusion between the Greek for \"no place\" and \"good place\": \"utopia\" is a compound of the syllable ou-, meaning \"no\" and topos, meaning place. But the homophonic prefix eu-, meaning \"good\", also resonates in the word, with the implication that the perfectly \"good place\" is really \"no place\".\nMythical and religious utopias.\nIn many cultures, societies, and religions, there is some myth or memory of a distant past when humankind lived in a primitive and simple state but at the same time one of perfect happiness and fulfillment. In those days, the various myths tell us, there was an instinctive harmony between humanity and nature. People's needs were few and their desires limited. Both were easily satisfied by the abundance provided by nature. Accordingly, there were no motives whatsoever for war or oppression. Nor was there any need for hard and painful work. Humans were simple and pious and felt themselves close to their God or gods. According to one anthropological theory, hunter-gatherers were the original affluent society.\nThese mythical or religious archetypes are inscribed in many cultures and resurge with special vitality when people are in difficult and critical times. However, in utopias, the projection of the myth does not take place towards the remote past but either towards the future or towards distant and fictional places, imagining that at some time in the future, at some point in space, or beyond death, there must exist the possibility of living happily.\nIn the United States and Europe, during the Second Great Awakening (ca. 1790\u20131840) and thereafter, many radical religious groups formed utopian societies in which faith could govern all aspects of members' lives. These utopian societies included the Shakers, who originated in England in the 18th century and arrived in America in 1774. A number of religious utopian societies from Europe came to the United States in the 18th and 19th centuries, including the Society of the Woman in the Wilderness (led by Johannes Kelpius (1667\u20131708), the Ephrata Cloister (established in 1732) and the Harmony Society, among others. The Harmony Society was a Christian theosophy and pietist group founded in Iptingen, Germany, in 1785. Due to religious persecution by the Lutheran Church and the government in W\u00fcrttemberg, the society moved to the United States on October 7, 1803, settling in Pennsylvania. On February 15, 1805, about 400 followers formally organized the Harmony Society, placing all their goods in common. The group lasted until 1905, making it one of the longest-running financially successful communes in American history.\nThe Oneida Community, founded by John Humphrey Noyes in Oneida, New York, was a utopian religious commune that lasted from 1848 to 1881. Although this utopian experiment has become better known today for its manufacture of Oneida silverware, it was one of the longest-running communes in American history. The Amana Colonies were communal settlements in Iowa, started by radical German pietists, which lasted from 1855 to 1932. The Amana Corporation, manufacturer of refrigerators and household appliances, was originally started by the group. Other examples are Fountain Grove (founded in 1875), Riker's Holy City and other Californian utopian colonies between 1855 and 1955 (Hine), as well as Sointula in British Columbia, Canada. The Amish and Hutterites can also be considered an attempt towards religious utopia. A wide variety of intentional communities with some type of faith-based ideas have also started across the world.\nAnthropologist Richard Sosis examined 200 communes in the 19th-century United States, both religious and secular (mostly utopian socialist). 39 percent of the religious communes were still functioning 20 years after their founding while only 6 percent of the secular communes were. The number of costly sacrifices that a religious commune demanded from its members had a linear effect on its longevity, while in secular communes demands for costly sacrifices did not correlate with longevity and the majority of the secular communes failed within 8 years. Sosis cites anthropologist Roy Rappaport in arguing that rituals and laws are more effective when sacralized. Social psychologist Jonathan Haidt cites Sosis's research in his 2012 book \"The Righteous Mind\" as the best evidence that religion is an adaptive solution to the free-rider problem by enabling cooperation without kinship. Evolutionary medicine researcher Randolph M. Nesse and theoretical biologist Mary Jane West-Eberhard have argued instead that because humans with altruistic tendencies are preferred as social partners they receive fitness advantages by social selection, with Nesse arguing further that social selection enabled humans as a species to become extraordinarily cooperative and capable of creating culture.\nThe Book of Revelation in the Christian Bible depicts an eschatological time with the defeat of Satan, of Evil and of Sin. The main difference compared to the Old Testament promises is that such a defeat also has an ontological value: \"Then I saw 'a new heaven and a new earth,' for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea...'He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death' or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away\" and no longer just gnosiological (Isaiah: \"See, I will create/new heavens and a new earth./The former things will not be remembered,/nor will they come to mind\". Narrow interpretation of the text depicts Heaven on Earth or a Heaven brought to Earth without sin. Daily and mundane details of this new Earth, where God and Jesus rule, remain unclear, although it is implied to be similar to the biblical Garden of Eden. Some theological philosophers believe that heaven will not be a physical realm but instead an incorporeal place for souls.\nGolden Age.\nThe Greek poet Hesiod, around the 8th century BC, in his compilation of the mythological tradition (the poem \"Works and Days\"), explained that, prior to the present era, there were four other progressively less perfect ones, the oldest of which was the Golden Age.\nScheria.\nPerhaps the oldest Utopia of which we know, as pointed out many years ago by Moses Finley, is Homer's Scheria, island of the Phaeacians. A mythical place, often equated with classical Corcyra, (modern Corfu/Kerkyra), where Odysseus was washed ashore after 10 years of storm-tossed wandering and escorted to the King's palace by his daughter Nausicaa. With stout walls, a stone temple and good harbours, it is perhaps the 'ideal' Greek colony, a model for those founded from the middle of the 8th Century onward. A land of plenty, home to expert mariners (with the self-navigating ships), and skilled craftswomen who live in peace under their king's rule and fear no strangers.\nPlutarch, the Greek historian and biographer of the 1st century, dealt with the blissful and mythic past of humanity.\nArcadia.\nFrom Sir Philip Sidney's prose romance \"The Old Arcadia\" (1580), originally a region in the Peloponnesus, Arcadia became a synonym for any rural area that serves as a pastoral setting, a \"locus amoenus\" (\"delightful place\").\nThe Biblical Garden of Eden.\nThe Biblical Garden of Eden as depicted in the Old Testament Bible's Book of Genesis 2 (Authorized Version of 1611):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAccording to the exegesis that the biblical theologian Herbert Haag proposes in the book \"Is original sin in Scripture?\", published soon after the Second Vatican Council, Genesis 2:25 would indicate that Adam and Eve were created from the beginning naked of the divine grace, an originary grace that, then, they would never have had and even less would have lost due to the subsequent events narrated. On the other hand, while supporting a continuity in the Bible about the absence of preternatural gifts () with regard to the ophitic event, Haag never makes any reference to the discontinuity of the loss of access to the tree of life.\nThe Land of Cockaigne.\nThe Land of Cockaigne (also Cockaygne, Cokaygne), was an imaginary land of idleness and luxury, famous in medieval stories and the subject of several poems, one of which, an early translation of a 13th-century French work, is given in George Ellis' \"Specimens of Early English Poets\". In this, \"the houses were made of barley sugar and cakes, the streets were paved with pastry and the shops supplied goods for nothing.\" London has been so called (see Cockney) but Boileau applies the same to Paris. Schlaraffenland is an analogous German tradition. All these myths also express some hope that the idyllic state of affairs they describe is not irretrievably and irrevocably lost to mankind, that it can be regained in some way or other.\nOne way might be a quest for an \"earthly paradise\"\u00a0\u2013 a place like Shangri-La, hidden in the Tibetan mountains and described by James Hilton in his utopian novel \"Lost Horizon\" (1933). Christopher Columbus followed directly in this tradition in his belief that he had found the Garden of Eden when, towards the end of the 15th century, he first encountered the New World and its indigenous inhabitants.\nThe Peach Blossom Spring.\nThe \"Peach Blossom Spring\" (), a prose piece written by the Chinese poet Tao Yuanming, describes a utopian place. The narrative goes that a fisherman from Wuling sailed upstream a river and came across a beautiful blossoming peach grove and lush green fields covered with blossom petals. Entranced by the beauty, he continued upstream and stumbled onto a small grotto when he reached the end of the river. Though narrow at first, he was able to squeeze through the passage and discovered an ethereal utopia, where the people led an ideal existence in harmony with nature. He saw a vast expanse of fertile lands, clear ponds, mulberry trees, bamboo groves and the like with a community of people of all ages and houses in neat rows. The people explained that their ancestors escaped to this place during the civil unrest of the Qin dynasty and they themselves had not left since or had contact with anyone from the outside. They had not even heard of the later dynasties of bygone times or the then-current Jin dynasty. In the story, the community was secluded and unaffected by the troubles of the outside world.\nThe sense of timelessness was predominant in the story as a perfect utopian community remains unchanged, that is, it had no decline nor the need to improve. Eventually, the Chinese term \"Peach Blossom Spring\" came to be synonymous for the concept of utopia.\nDatong.\nDatong() is a traditional Chinese Utopia. The main description of it is found in the Chinese Classic of Rites, in the chapter called \"Li Yun\"(). Later, Datong and its ideal of 'The World Belongs to Everyone/The World is Held in Common' Tianxia weigong() influenced modern Chinese reformers and revolutionaries, such as Kang Youwei.\nKetumati.\nIt is said, once Maitreya is reborn into the future kingdom of Ketumati, a utopian age will commence. The city is described in Buddhism as a domain filled with palaces made of gems and surrounded by Kalpavriksha trees producing goods. During its years, none of the inhabitants of Jambudvipa will need to take part in cultivation and hunger will no longer exist.\nModern utopias.\nIn the 21st century, discussions around utopia for some authors include post-scarcity economics, late capitalism, and universal basic income; for example, the \"human capitalism\" utopia envisioned in \"Utopia for Realists\" (Rutger Bregman 2016) includes a universal basic income and a 15-hour workweek, along with open borders.\nScandinavian nations, which as of 2019 ranked at the top of the World Happiness Report, are sometimes cited as modern utopias. But British author Michael Booth called that a myth and wrote the 2014 book The Almost Nearly Perfect People about life in the Nordic countries.\nSocial and economic utopias.\nParticularly in the early 19th century, several utopian ideas arose, often in response to the belief that social disruption was created and caused by the development of commercialism and capitalism. These ideas are often grouped in a greater \"utopian socialist\" movement, due to their shared characteristics. A once common characteristic is an egalitarian distribution of goods, frequently with the total abolition of money. Citizens only do work which they enjoy and which is for the common good, leaving them with ample time for the cultivation of the arts and sciences. \nOne classic example of such a utopia appears in Edward Bellamy's 1888 novel \"Looking Backward\". William Morris depicts another socialist utopia in his 1890 novel \"News from Nowhere\", written partially in response to the top-down (bureaucratic) nature of Bellamy's utopia, which Morris criticized. However, as the socialist movement developed, it moved away from utopianism; Marx in particular became a harsh critic of earlier socialism which he negatively characterized as \"utopian\". (For more information, see the History of Socialism article.) In a materialist utopian society, the economy is perfect; there is no inflation and only perfect social and financial equality exists.\nEdward Gibbon Wakefield's utopian theorizing on systematic colonial settlement policy in the early-19th century also centred on economic considerations, but with a view to preserving class distinctions;\nWakefield influenced several colonies founded in New Zealand and Australia in the 1830s, 1840s and 1850s.\nIn 1905, H. G. Wells published \"A Modern Utopia\", which was widely read and admired and provoked much discussion. \nPart of Eric Frank Russell's book \"The Great Explosion\" (1963) details an economic and social utopia. This book was the first to mention the idea of Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS).\nThe utopias created by Soviet authors, especially during the Khrushchev Thaw era, were simultaneously social and technological, depicting a communist society of the future underpinned by the advanced technology and featuring both a new person and new socio-economical institutions. Ivan Efremov's ' was the key text of this genre in which the boundaries of humanity are transcended. Later works by Strugatsky Brothers including ', are more ambivalent and their utopian future is a distillation of whatever is best in today's humanity. Soviet utopian works were influenced by the utopian socialism and the concept of noosphere.\nScience and technology.\nThough Francis Bacon's \"New Atlantis\" is imbued with a scientific spirit, scientific and technological utopias tend to be based in the future, when it is believed that advanced science and technology will allow utopian living standards; for example, the absence of death and suffering; changes in human nature and the human condition. Technology has affected the way humans have lived to such an extent that normal functions, like sleep, eating or even reproduction, have been replaced by artificial means. Other examples include a society where humans have struck a balance with technology and it is merely used to enhance the human living condition (e.g. \"Star Trek\"). In place of the static perfection of a utopia, libertarian transhumanists envision an \"extropia\", an open, evolving society allowing individuals and voluntary groupings to form the institutions and social forms they prefer.\nMariah Utsawa presented a theoretical basis for technological utopianism and set out to develop a variety of technologies ranging from maps to designs for cars and houses which might lead to the development of such a utopia. In his book \"Deep Utopia: Life and Meaning in a Solved World\", philosopher Nick Bostrom explores what to do in a \"solved world\", assuming that human civilization safely builds machine superintelligence and manages to solve its political, coordination and fairness problems. He outlines some technologies considered physically possible at technological maturity, such as cognitive enhancement, reversal of aging, self-replicating spacecrafts, arbitrary sensory inputs (taste, sound...), or the precise control of motivation, mood, well-being and personality.\nOne notable example of a technological and libertarian socialist utopia is Scottish author Iain Banks' Culture.\nOpposing this optimistic perspective are scenarios where advanced science and technology will, through deliberate misuse or accident, cause environmental damage or even humanity's extinction. Critics, such as Jacques Ellul and Timothy Mitchell advocate precautions against the premature embrace of new technologies. Both raise questions about changing responsibility and freedom brought by division of labour. Authors such as John Zerzan and Derrick Jensen consider that modern technology is progressively depriving humans of their autonomy and advocate the collapse of the industrial civilization, in favor of small-scale organization, as a necessary path to avoid the threat of technology on human freedom and sustainability.\nThere are many examples of techno-dystopias portrayed in mainstream culture, such as the classics \"Brave New World\" and \"Nineteen Eighty-Four,\" often published as \"1984\", which have explored some of these topics.\nEcological.\nEcological utopian society describes new ways in which society should relate to nature. ' from 1975 by Ernest Callenbach was one of the first influential ecological utopian novels. Richard Grove's book ' from 1995 suggested the roots of ecological utopian thinking. Grove's book sees early environmentalism as a result of the impact of utopian tropical islands on European data-driven scientists. The works on ecological eutopia perceive a widening gap between the modern Western way of living that destroys nature and a more traditional way of living before industrialization. Ecological utopias may advocate a society that is more sustainable. According to the Dutch philosopher Marius de Geus, ecological utopias could be inspirational sources for movements involving green politics.\nFeminism.\nUtopias have been used to explore the ramifications of genders being either a societal construct or a biologically \"hard-wired\" imperative or some mix of the two. Socialist and economic utopias have tended to take the \"woman question\" seriously and often to offer some form of equality between the sexes as part and parcel of their vision, whether this be by addressing misogyny, reorganizing society along separatist lines, creating a certain kind of androgynous equality that ignores gender or in some other manner. For example, Edward Bellamy's \"Looking Backward\" (1887) responded, progressively for his day, to the contemporary women's suffrage and women's rights movements. Bellamy supported these movements by incorporating the equality of women and men into his utopian world's structure, albeit by consigning women to a separate sphere of light industrial activity (due to women's lesser physical strength) and making various exceptions for them in order to make room for (and to praise) motherhood. One of the earlier feminist utopias that imagines complete separatism is Charlotte Perkins Gilman's \"Herland\" (1915).\nIn science fiction and technological speculation, gender can be challenged on the biological as well as the social level. Marge Piercy's \"Woman on the Edge of Time\" portrays equality between the genders and complete equality in sexuality (regardless of the gender of the lovers). Birth-giving, often felt as the divider that cannot be avoided in discussions of women's rights and roles, has been shifted onto elaborate biological machinery that functions to offer an enriched embryonic experience. When a child is born, it spends most of its time in the children's ward with peers. Three \"mothers\" per child are the norm and they are chosen in a gender neutral way (men as well as women may become \"mothers\") on the basis of their experience and ability. Technological advances also make possible the freeing of women from childbearing in Shulamith Firestone's \"The Dialectic of Sex\". The fictional aliens in Mary Gentle's \"Golden Witchbreed\" start out as gender-neutral children and do not develop into men and women until puberty and gender has no bearing on social roles. In contrast, Doris Lessing's \"The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five\" (1980) suggests that men's and women's values are inherent to the sexes and cannot be changed, making a compromise between them essential. In \"My Own Utopia\" (1961) by Elizabeth Mann Borghese, gender exists but is dependent upon age rather than sex\u00a0\u2013 genderless children mature into women, some of whom eventually become men. \"William Marston's Wonder Woman comics of the 1940s featured Paradise Island, also known as Themyscira, a matriarchal all-female community of peace, loving submission, bondage and giant space kangaroos.\"\nUtopian single-gender worlds or single-sex societies have long been one of the primary ways to explore implications of gender and gender-differences. In speculative fiction, female-only worlds have been imagined to come about by the action of disease that wipes out men, along with the development of technological or mystical method that allow female parthenogenic reproduction. Charlotte Perkins Gilman's 1915 novel approaches this type of separate society. Many feminist utopias pondering separatism were written in the 1970s, as a response to the Lesbian separatist movement; examples include Joanna Russ's \"The Female Man\" and Suzy McKee Charnas's \"Walk to the End of the World\" and \"Motherlines\". Utopias imagined by male authors have often included equality between sexes, rather than separation, although as noted Bellamy's strategy includes a certain amount of \"separate but equal\". The use of female-only worlds allows the exploration of female independence and freedom from patriarchy. The societies may be lesbian, such as \"Daughters of a Coral Dawn\" by Katherine V. Forrest or not, and may not be sexual at all\u00a0\u2013 a famous early sexless example being \"Herland\" (1915) by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. Charlene Ball writes in \"Women's Studies Encyclopedia\" that use of speculative fiction to explore gender roles in future societies has been more common in the United States compared to Europe and elsewhere, although such efforts as Gerd Brantenberg's \"Egalia's Daughters\" and Christa Wolf's portrayal of the land of Colchis in her \"Medea: Voices \"are certainly as influential and famous as any of the American feminist utopias.\nIntentional communities and experimental living.\nThe English political philosopher James Harrington (1611\u20131677), author of the utopian work \"The Commonwealth of Oceana\", published in 1656, inspired English country-party republicanism (1680s to 1740s) and became influential in the design of three American colonies. His theories ultimately contributed to the idealistic principles of the American Founders. The colonies of Carolina (founded in 1670), Pennsylvania (founded in 1681), and Georgia (founded in 1733) were the only three English colonies in America that were planned as utopian societies with an integrated physical, economic and social design. At the heart of the plan for Georgia was a concept of \"agrarian equality\" in which land was allocated equally and additional land acquisition through purchase or inheritance was prohibited; the plan was an early step toward the yeoman republic later envisioned by Thomas Jefferson.\nThe communes of the 1960s in the United States often represented an attempt to greatly improve the way humans live together in communities. The back-to-the-land movements and hippies inspired many to try to live in peace and harmony on farms or in remote areas and to set up new types of governance. Communes like Kaliflower, which existed between 1967 and 1973, attempted to live outside of society's norms and to create their own ideal communalist society.\nPeople all over the world organized and built intentional communities with the hope of developing a better way of living together. Many of these intentional communities are relatively small, with populations close to 100. While many of these small communities failed, some are still in existence. The religion-based Twelve Tribes, which started in the United States in 1972, grew into many groups around the world. \nSimilarly, the commune Brook Farm was established in 1841, founded by Charles Fourier's visions of Utopia. Its residents attempted to recreate Fourier's idea of the Phalanx, a central building in a society. However, this commune did not sustain itself and ended after only six years of operation. Its residents wanted to keep it going but could not primarily due to financial difficulties. The community's goal aligned with utopian ideals of leading a more wholesome and simpler life and avoiding the atmosphere of social pressure in the surrounding society at the time. Despite ambition and hopes, it is difficult for communes to stay in operation.\nWalter Elias Disney's original EPCOT (concept) (Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow), Paolo Soleri's Arcosanti, Everyday Utopias by Davina Cooper, and Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Neom are examples of Utopian city design.\nCritical Utopia.\nCritical utopia is a theory conceptualised by literary theorist Tom Moylan. In contrast with utopianism, critical utopia rejects utopia. The idea is highly self-referential and uses the idea of utopia to advance society while critiquing it simultaneously. A problem with utopianism is identified: it has limitations since the imagined utopia is significantly distant from current society. Utopia also fails to acknowledge the differences between people that result in differences in experience. Moylan explains that \"[critical utopias] ultimately refer to something other than a predictable alternative paradigm, for at their core they identify self-critical utopian discourse itself as a process that can tear apart the dominant ideological web. Here, then, critical utopian discourse becomes a seditious expression of social change and popular sovereignty carried on in a permanently open process of envisioning what is not yet.\"\nCultural legacy.\nBy one count, more than 400 utopian works in the English language were published prior to the year 1900, and over a thousand during the 20th century.\nSeveral plays and films also present utopian visions. The 1937 film \"Lost Horizon\", the 1954 nudist film \"Garden of Eden\", and the 1984 film \"The Other Side of the Horizon\" portray utopian communities. \"They Came to a City\", a 1944 British science fiction film, was adapted from the 1943 play of the same title written by J. B. Priestley. It portrays the arrival of nine Britons in a mysterious city that to some is a utopia; to others not so much. The 2024 Francis Ford Coppolla film \"Megalopolis\" considers the obstacles faced by an architect who wants to found a utopian community in an alternate future U.S.A. under a corrupt emperor.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The core of the United Kingdom as a unified state came into being with the political union of the kingdoms of England and Scotland, into a new unitary state called Great Britain. \nThe first decades were marked by Jacobite risings which ended with defeat for the Stuart cause at the Battle of Culloden in 1746. In 1763, victory in the Seven Years' War led to the growth of the First British Empire. With defeat by the US, France and Spain in the War of American Independence, Great Britain lost its 13 American colonies and rebuilt a Second British Empire based in Asia and Africa. Politically the central event was the French Revolution and its Napoleonic aftermath from 1793 to 1815, which British elites saw as a profound threat, and worked energetically to form multiple coalitions that finally defeated Napoleon in 1815. The Acts of Union 1800 added the Kingdom of Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\nThe Tories, who came to power in 1783, remained in power until 1830. Forces of reform opened decades of political reform that broadened the ballot, and opened the economy to free trade. The outstanding political leaders of the 19th century included Palmerston, Disraeli, Gladstone, and Salisbury. Culturally, the Victorian era was a time of prosperity and dominant middle-class virtues when Britain dominated the world economy and maintained a generally peaceful century from 1815 to 1914. The First World War, with Britain in alliance with France, Russia and the US, was a furious but ultimately successful total war with Germany. The resulting League of Nations was a favourite project in Interwar Britain. In 1922, 26 counties of Ireland seceded to become the Irish Free State; a day later, Northern Ireland seceded from the Free State and returned to the United Kingdom. In 1927, the United Kingdom changed its formal title to the \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,\" usually shortened to \"Britain\", \"United Kingdom\" or \"UK\". While the Empire remained strong, as did the London financial markets, the British industrial base began to slip behind Germany and the US. Sentiments for peace were so strong that the nation supported appeasement of Hitler's Germany in the 1930s, until the Nazi invasion of Poland in 1939 started the Second World War. In the Second World War, the Soviet Union and the US joined the UK as the main Allied powers.\nAfter the war, Britain was no longer a military or economic superpower, as seen in the Suez Crisis of 1956. Britain granted independence to almost all its possessions. The new states typically joined the Commonwealth of Nations. The postwar years saw great hardships, alleviated somewhat by large-scale financial aid from the US. Prosperity returned in the 1950s. Meanwhile, from 1945 to 1950, the Labour Party built a welfare state, nationalised many industries, and created the National Health Service. The UK took a strong stand against Communist expansion after 1945, playing a major role in the Cold War and the formation of NATO as an anti-Soviet military alliance with West Germany, France, the US, Italy, Canada and smaller countries. The UK has been a leading member of the United Nations since its founding, as well as other international organisations. In the 1990s, neoliberalism led to the privatisation of nationalised industries and significant deregulation of business affairs. London's status as a world financial hub grew. Since the 1990s, large-scale devolution movements in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have decentralised political decision-making. Britain has moved back and forth on its economic relationships with Western Europe. It joined the European Economic Community in 1973, thereby weakening economic ties with its Commonwealth. However, the Brexit referendum in 2016 committed the UK to leave the European Union, which it did in 2020.\n18th century.\nBirth of the Union.\nThe Kingdom of Great Britain came into being on 1 May 1707, as a result of the political union of the Kingdom of England (which included Wales) and the Kingdom of Scotland under the Treaty of Union. This combined the two kingdoms into a single kingdom and merged the two parliaments into a single parliament of Great Britain. Queen Anne became the first monarch of the new Great Britain. Although now a single kingdom, certain institutions of Scotland and England remained separate, such as Scottish and English law; and the Presbyterian Church of Scotland and the Anglican Church of England. England and Scotland each continued to have their own system of education.\nMeanwhile, the War of the Spanish Succession against France was underway. It see-sawed back and forth until the treaties of Utrecht and Rastadt ended the war. Historian G. M. Trevelyan argues: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;That Treaty [of Utrecht], which ushered in the stable and characteristic period of Eighteenth-Century civilization, marked the end of danger to Europe from the old French monarchy, and it marked a change of no less significance to the world at large,\u2014the maritime, commercial and financial supremacy of Great Britain.\nHanoverian kings.\nThe Stuart line died with Anne in 1714, although a die-hard faction with French support supported pretenders. The Elector of Hanover became king as George I. He paid more attention to Hanover and surrounded himself with Germans, making him an unpopular king. He did, however, build up the army and created a more stable political system in Britain and helped bring peace to northern Europe. Jacobite factions seeking a Stuart restoration remained strong; they instigated a revolt in 1715\u20131716. The son of James II planned to invade England, but before he could do so, John Erskine, Earl of Mar, launched an invasion from Scotland, which was easily defeated.\nGeorge II enhanced the stability of the constitutional system, with a government run by Robert Walpole during the period 1730\u201342. He built up the First British Empire, strengthening the colonies in the Caribbean and North America. In coalition with the rising power Prussia, the United Kingdom defeated France in the Seven Years' War, and won full control of Canada.\nGeorge III never visited Hanover, and spoke English as his first language. Reviled by Americans as a tyrant and the instigator of the American War of Independence, he was often insane after 1788, and his eldest son served as regent. He was the last king to dominate government and politics, and his long reign is noted for losing the first British Empire in the American Revolutionary War (1783). The reign was notable for the building of a second empire based in India, Asia and Africa, the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution that made Britain an economic powerhouse, and the life and death struggle with the French, in the French Revolutionary Wars, which ended inconclusively with a short truce, and the epic Napoleonic Wars, which ended with the decisive defeat of Napoleon.\nSouth Sea Bubble.\nEntrepreneurs extended the range of their business around the globe. The South Sea Bubble was a business enterprise that exploded in scandal. The South Sea Company was a joint-stock company in London. Its ostensible object was to grant trade monopolies in South America; but its actual purpose was to renegotiate previous high-interest government loans amounting to \u00a331 million through market manipulation and speculation. It raised money four times in 1720 by issuing stock, which was purchased by about 8,000 investors. The share price kept increasing, from \u00a3130 a share to \u00a31,000, with insiders making huge paper profits. The Bubble collapsed overnight, ruining speculators. Investigations showed bribes had reached into high places\u2014even to the king. Robert Walpole wound it down with minimal political and economic damage.\nRobert Walpole.\nRobert Walpole is now generally regarded as the first Prime Minister, from, 1721\u201342. The term was applied to him by friends and foes alike by 1727. Historian Clayton Roberts summarizes his new functions:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMoralism and hypocrisy.\nHypocrisy became a major topic in political history in the early 18th century. The Toleration Act 1688 allowed for rights for religious minorities, but Protestant Nonconformists were still deprived of important rights, such as the right to hold office. Nonconformists who wanted to hold office ostentatiously took the Anglican sacrament once a year to avoid the restrictions. High Church Anglicans were outraged, and outlawed \"occasional conformity\" with the Occasional Conformity Act 1711. Using sermons, speeches, and pamphlet wars, high churchmen and Nonconformists attacked their opponents as insincere and hypocritical, as well as dangerously zealous. Historian Mark Knights argues that by its ferocity, the debate may have led to more temperate and less hypercharged political discourse. \"Occasional conformity\" was restored by the Whigs when they returned to power in 1719.\nEnglish author Bernard Mandeville's famous \"The Fable of the Bees\" explored the nature of hypocrisy in contemporary European society. He argued that the efforts of self-seeking entrepreneurs are the basis of emerging commercial and industrial society, a line of thought that influenced Adam Smith and 19th-century Utilitarianism. A tension arose between these two approaches concerning the relative power of norms and interests, the relationship between motives and behaviour, and the historical variability of human cultures.\nFrom around 1750 to 1850, Whig aristocrats in England boasted of their special benevolence for the common people. They claimed to be guiding reform initiatives to prevent the discontent that caused instability and revolution across Europe. However Tory and radical critics accused the Whigs of hypocrisy\u2014alleging they were deliberately using the slogans of reform and democracy to boost themselves into power. Historian L.G. Mitchell defends the Whigs, pointing out that thanks to them radicals always had friends at the centre of the elite, and thus did not feel as marginalised as in most of Europe. Meanwhile, a stream of observers from the Continent commented on the British political culture. Liberal and radical observers noted the servility of the lower classes, the obsession everyone had with rank and title, the extravagance of the aristocracy, and a pervasive hypocrisy that extended into such areas as social reform. There were not so many conservative visitors. They praised the stability of English society, its ancient constitution, and reverence for the past; they ignored the negative effects of industrialisation.\nHistorians have explored crimes and vices of England's upper classes, especially duelling, suicide, adultery and gambling. They were tolerated by the same courts that executed thousands of poor men for lesser offenses. No aristocrat was punished for killing someone in a duel. However the emerging popular press specialised in sensationalistic stories about upper-class vice.\nWarfare and finance.\nFrom 1700 to 1850, Britain was involved in 137 wars or rebellions. It maintained a relatively large and expensive Royal Navy, along with a small standing army. When the need arose for soldiers it hired mercenaries or financed allies who fielded armies. The rising costs of warfare forced a shift in sources of government financing, from the income from royal agricultural estates and special imposts and taxes to reliance on customs and excise taxes; and, after 1790, an income tax. Working with bankers in the city, the government raised loans during wartime and paid them off in peacetime. The rise in taxes amounted to 20% of national income, but the private sector benefited from the increase in economic growth. The demand for war supplies stimulated the industrial sector, particularly naval supplies, munitions and textiles, which gave Britain an advantage in international trade during the postwar years.\nThe French Revolution polarised British political opinion in the 1790s, with conservatives outraged at the killing of the king, the expulsion of the nobles, and the Reign of Terror. Britain was at war against France almost continuously from 1793 until the final defeat of Napoleon in 1815. Conservatives castigated radical opinion in Britain as \"Jacobin\" (in reference to the leaders of the Terror), warning that radicalism threatened an upheaval of society. The Anti-Jacobin sentiment, well expressed by Edmund Burke and many popular writers was strongest among the landed gentry and upper classes.\nBritish Empire.\nThe Seven Years' War, which began in 1756, was the first waged on a global scale, fought in Europe, India, North America, the Caribbean, the Philippines and coastal Africa. Britain was the big winner as it enlarged its empire at the expense of France and others. France lost its role as a colonial power in North America. It ceded New France to Britain, Spain ceded Florida. In India, the Carnatic war had left France still in control of its small enclaves but with military restrictions and an obligation to support British client states, effectively leaving the future of India to Britain. The British victory over France in the Seven Years' War left Britain as the world's dominant colonial power.\nAmerican Revolution.\nDuring the 1760s and 1770s, relations between the Thirteen Colonies and Britain became strained, primarily because of anger against Parliament's attempts to tax American colonists without their consent. The Americans readied their large militias, but were short of gunpowder and artillery. The British assumed they could easily suppress Patriot resistance. In 1775 the American Revolutionary War began. In 1776 the Patriots expelled royal officials and declared the independence of the United States of America. After capturing a British invasion army in 1777, the new nation formed an alliance with France, equalizing the military and naval balance and putting Britain at risk of invasion from France. The British army controlled only a handful of coastal cities in the U.S. 1780\u201381 was a low point for Britain. Taxes and deficits were high, government corruption was pervasive, and the war in America was entering its sixth year with no end in sight. The Gordon Riots erupted in London during the spring of 1780, in response to increased concessions to Catholics by Parliament. In October 1781 Lord Cornwallis surrendered his army at Yorktown, Virginia. The Treaty of Paris was signed in 1783, formally terminating the war and recognising the independence of the US. The peace terms were generous to the new nation, which London hoped correctly would become a major trading partner.\nSecond British Empire.\nThe loss of the Thirteen Colonies, at the time Britain's most populous, marked the transition between the \"first\" and \"second\" empires, in which Britain shifted its attention to Asia, the Pacific and later Africa. Adam Smith's \"The Wealth of Nations\", published in 1776, had argued colonies were redundant, and free trade should replace the mercantilist policies of the first period of colonial expansion. The growth of trade between the newly independent United States and Britain after 1783 confirmed Smith's view that political control was not necessary for economic success.\nDuring its first 100 years of operation, the focus of the British East India Company had been trade, not the building of an empire in India. Company interests turned from trade to territory during the 18th century as the Mughal Empire declined in power and the Company struggled with its French counterpart, the French East India Company, during the Carnatic wars of the 1740s and 1750s. The British, led by Robert Clive, defeated the French and their Indian allies in the Battle of Plassey, leaving the Company in control of Bengal and a major military and political power in India. It gradually increased the size of the territories under its control, either ruling directly or indirectly via local puppet rulers under the threat of force of the Indian Army, 80% of which was composed of native Indian sepoys.\nOn 22 August 1770, James Cook discovered the eastern coast of Australia while on a scientific voyage to the South Pacific. In 1778, Joseph Banks, Cook's botanist on the voyage, presented evidence to the government on the suitability of Botany Bay for the establishment of a penal settlement, and in 1787 the first shipment of convicts set sail, arriving in 1788.\n1800 to 1837.\nUnion with Ireland.\n The Flag of the United Kingdom is based on the flags of England, Scotland and the saltire of the Order of St Patrick (not the flag of Ireland).\nOn 1 January 1801, the Great Britain and Ireland joined to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The legislative union of Great Britain and Ireland was brought about by the Act of Union 1800, creating the \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\". The Act was passed in both the Parliament of Great Britain and the Parliament of Ireland, dominated by the Protestant Ascendancy and lacking representation of the catholic population. Substantial majorities were achieved, and this was assisted by bribery in the form of the awarding of peerages and honours to opponents to gain their votes.\nUnder the terms of the merger, the separate Parliaments of Great Britain and Ireland were abolished, and replaced by a united Parliament of the United Kingdom. Ireland thus became an integral part of the United Kingdom, sending around 100 MPs to the House of Commons at Westminster and 28 Irish representative peers to the House of Lords, elected by the Irish peers themselves, except that catholic peers were not permitted to take their seats in the Lords. Part of the trade-off for the Irish Catholics was to be the granting of Catholic emancipation, which had been fiercely resisted by the all-Anglican Irish Parliament. However, this was blocked by King George III, who argued that emancipating the Roman Catholics would breach his Coronation Oath. The Roman Catholic hierarchy had endorsed the Union. However the decision to block Catholic Emancipation fatally undermined the appeal of the Union.\nNapoleonic wars.\nAt the start of the 19th century, Britain was challenged again by France under Napoleon, in a struggle that, unlike previous wars, represented a contest of ideologies between the two nations: the constitutional monarchy of Great Britain versus the liberal principles of the French Revolution ostensibly championed by the Napoleonic empire. It was not only Britain's position on the world stage that was threatened: Napoleon threatened invasion of Britain, and with it, a fate similar to the countries of continental Europe that his armies had overrun.\nDuring the War of the Second Coalition, Britain occupied most of the French and Dutch colonies, but tropical diseases claimed the lives of over 40,000 troops. When the Treaty of Amiens created a pause, Britain was forced to return most of the colonies. In May 1803, war was declared again. Napoleon's plans to invade Britain failed due to the inferiority of his navy, and in 1805, Nelson's fleet decisively defeated the French and Spanish at Trafalgar, which was the last significant naval action of the Napoleonic Wars.\nIn 1806, Napoleon issued the series of Berlin Decrees, which brought into effect the Continental System. This policy aimed to weaken the British export economy closing French-controlled territory to its trade. Napoleon hoped that isolating Britain from the Continent would end its economic dominance. It never succeeded in its objective. There was some damage to Britain, but its control of the oceans helped ameliorate the damage. Even more damage was done to the economies of France and its allies, which lost a useful trading partner. Angry governments gained an incentive to ignore the Continental System, which led to the weakening of Napoleon's coalition. Britain possessed the greatest industrial capacity in Europe, and its mastery of the seas allowed it to build up economic strength through trade to its possessions from its rapidly expanding new Empire. Britain's naval supremacy meant that France could never enjoy the peace necessary to consolidate its control over Europe, and it could threaten neither the home islands nor the main British colonies.\nThe Dos de Mayo Uprising permitted Britain to gain a foothold on the Continent. The Duke of Wellington and his army of British and Portuguese pushed the French out of Spain and in early 1814, as Napoleon was being driven back in the east by the Prussians, Austrians, and Russians, Wellington invaded southern France. After Napoleon's surrender and exile to the island of Elba, peace appeared to have returned, but when he escaped back into France in 1815, the British and their allies had to fight him again. The armies of Wellington and von Bl\u00fccher defeated Napoleon once and for all at Waterloo.\nFinancing the war.\nA key element in British success was its ability to mobilize industrial and financial resources and apply them to defeating France. With a population of 16 million Britain was barely half the size of France with 30 million. In terms of soldiers the French numerical advantage was offset by British subsidies that paid for a large proportion of the Austrian and Russian soldiers, peaking at about 450,000 in 1813. Most important, the British national output remained strong and the well-organised business sector channeled products into what the military needed. The system of smuggling finished products into the continent undermined French efforts to ruin the British economy by cutting off markets. The British budget in 1814 reached \u00a366 million, including \u00a310 million for the Navy, \u00a340 million for the Army, \u00a310 million for the Allies, and \u00a338 million as interest on the national debt. The national debt soared to \u00a3679 million, more than double the GDP. It was supported by hundreds of thousands of investors and tax payers, despite the higher taxes on land and a new income tax. The cost of the war came to \u00a3830 million. By contrast the French financial system was inadequate and Napoleon had to rely in part on requisitions from conquered lands.\nWar of 1812 with United States.\nSimultaneous with the Napoleonic Wars, trade disputes and British impressment of American sailors led to the War of 1812. This was the \"Second War of Independence\" for the Americans, though it was never about British efforts to conquer the former colonies, but the conquest of the Canadian colonies by the Americans. The British could devote few resources to the conflict until the fall of Napoleon in 1814. American frigates inflicted defeats on the British navy, which was short on manpower due to the conflict in Europe. A stepped-up war effort brought about some successes such as the burning of Washington, but many influential voices such as the Duke of Wellington argued that an outright victory over the US was impossible.\nPeace was agreed to at the end of 1814, but Andrew Jackson, unaware of this, won a great victory over the British at the Battle of New Orleans in January 1815. Ratification of the Treaty of Ghent ended the war in February 1815. The major result was the permanent defeat of the Indian allies the British had counted upon. The US-Canada border was demilitarised by both countries, and peaceful trade resumed, although worries of an American conquest of Canada persisted.\nPostwar repression by reactionary landed elites.\nThe postwar era was a time of economic depression, poor harvests, growing inflation, and high unemployment among returning soldiers. As industrialisation progressed, Britain was more urban and less rural, and power shifted accordingly. The dominant Tory leadership, based in the declining rural sector, was fearful, reactionary and repressive. Tories feared the emergence of radicals conspiring to emulate the dreaded French Revolution. In reality the violent radical element was small and weak; there were small conspiracies involving men with few followers and careless security; they were quickly suppressed. Techniques of repression included the suspension of Habeas Corpus in 1817 (allowing the government to hold suspects without cause or trial). Sidmouth's Gagging Acts of 1817 heavily muzzled the opposition newspapers; the reformers switched to pamphlets and sold 50,000 a week. In reaction to the Peterloo Massacre of 1819, the Liverpool government passed the \"Six Acts\" in 1819. They prohibited drills and military exercises; facilitated warrants for the search for weapons; outlawed public meetings of more than 50 people; put heavy penalties on blasphemous and seditious publications; imposing a fourpenny stamp act on many pamphlets to cut down the flow on criticism. Offenders could be harshly punished including exile to Australia. The laws were designed to deter troublemakers and reassure conservatives; they were not often used. By the end of the 1820s, along with an economic recovery, many of these repressive laws were repealed.\nWeak monarchs.\nGeorge IV was a weak ruler as regent (1811\u20131820) and king (1820\u20131830). He let his ministers take full charge of government affairs, playing a far lesser role than George III. The principle now became established that the king accepts as prime minister the person who wins a majority in the House of Commons, whether the king personally favours them. His governments, with little help from the king, presided over victory in the Napoleonic Wars, negotiated the peace settlement, and attempted to deal with the social and economic malaise that followed. His brother William IV ruled 1830-37, but was little involved in politics. His reign saw reforms: the poor law was updated, child labour restricted, slavery abolished in nearly all the British Empire, and, most important, the Reform Act 1832 refashioned the British electoral system.\nForeign affairs.\nThere were no major wars until the Crimean War of 1853\u201356. While Prussia, Austria, and Russia, as absolute monarchies, tried to suppress liberalism wherever it might occur, the British came to terms with new ideas. Britain intervened in Portugal in 1826 to defend a constitutional government there and recognising the independence of Spain's American colonies in 1824. British merchants and financiers, and later railway builders, played major roles in the economies of Latin American nations. The British intervened in 1827 on the side of the Greeks, who had been waging the Greek War of Independence against the Ottoman Empire since 1821.\nWhig reforms of the 1830s.\nThe Whig Party recovered its strength and unity by supporting moral reforms, especially of the electoral system, the abolition of slavery and emancipation of the Catholics. Catholic emancipation was secured in the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, which removed the most substantial restrictions on Roman Catholics in Britain.\nThe Whigs became champions of Parliamentary reform. They made Lord Grey prime minister 1830\u201334, and the Reform Act 1832 became their signature measure. It broadened the franchise slightly and ended the system of rotten and pocket boroughs (where elections were controlled by powerful families), and gave seats to new industrial centres. The aristocracy continued to dominate the government, the Army and Royal Navy, and high society. After parliamentary investigations demonstrated the horrors of child labour, limited reforms were passed in 1833.\nChartism emerged after the 1832 Reform Act failed to give the vote to the working class. Activists denounced the 'betrayal' and the 'sacrificing' of their interests by the 'misconduct' of the government. In 1838, Chartists issued the People's Charter demanding manhood suffrage, equal sized election districts, voting by ballots, payment of MPs (so poor men could serve), annual Parliaments, and abolition of property requirements. The Chartists were unable to force serious constitutional debate. Historians see Chartism as a continuation of the 18th-century fight against corruption and a new stage in demands for democracy in an industrial society. In 1832, Parliament abolished slavery in the Empire with the Slavery Abolition Act 1833. The government purchased the slaves for \u00a320,000,000, and freed the slaves, especially those in the Caribbean sugar islands.\nVictorian era.\nQueen Victoria ascended the throne in 1837, aged 18. Her long reign until 1901 saw Britain reach the zenith of its economic and political power. Exciting new technologies such as steam ships, railways, photography, and telegraphs appeared, making the world faster-paced. Britain remained mostly inactive in Continental politics, and it was not affected by the wave of revolutions in 1848. The Victorian era saw the fleshing out of the second British Empire. The era was preceded by the Georgian era and succeeded by the Edwardian era.\nHistorians like Bernard Porter have characterised the mid-Victorian era, (1850\u20131870) as Britain's 'Golden Years'. There was peace and prosperity, as the national income per person grew by half. Much of the prosperity was due to the increasing industrialisation, especially in textiles and machinery, as well as to the worldwide network of trade and engineering that produce profits for British merchants and experts from across the globe. There was peace abroad, and social peace at home. Reforms in industrial conditions were set by Parliament. The Mines and Collieries Act 1842 banned employment of girls and boys under ten years old from working underground in coal mines. The Chartist movement, peaked as a democratic movement among the working class in 1848; its leaders moved to other pursuits, such as trade unions and cooperative societies. The working class ignored foreign agitators like Karl Marx in their midst, and joined in celebrating the new prosperity. Employers typically were paternalistic, and generally recognised the trade unions. Companies provided their employees with welfare services ranging from housing, schools and churches, to libraries, baths, and gymnasia. Middle-class reformers did their best to assist the working classes aspire to middle-class norms of 'respectability.'\nTaxes were very low, and government restrictions were minimal. There were still problem areas, such as riots, especially those motivated by anti-Catholicism. Society was still ruled by the aristocracy and the gentry, which controlled high government offices, both houses of Parliament, the church, and the military. Becoming a rich businessman was not as prestigious as inheriting a title and owning a landed estate. Literature was doing well, but the fine arts languished as the Great Exhibition of 1851 showcased Britain's industrial prowess rather than its sculpture, painting or music. The educational system was mediocre. Historian Llewellyn Woodward has concluded:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For leisure or work, for getting or spending, England was a better country in 1879 than in 1815. The scales were less weighted against the weak, against women and children, and against the poor. There was greater movement, and less of the fatalism of an earlier age. The public conscience was more instructed, and the content of liberty was being widened to include something more than freedom from political constraint... Yet England in 1871 was by no means an earthly paradise. The housing and conditions of life of the working class in town &amp; country were still a disgrace to an age of plenty.\nAccording to historians David Brandon and Alan Brooke, the new system of railways after 1830 brought into being our modern world:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Excelling in the bulk movement of coal, they provided the fuel for the furnaces of industry and for domestic fireplaces. Millions of people were able to travel who had scarcely ever travelled before. Railways enabled mail, newspapers, periodicals and cheap literature to be distributed easily, quickly and cheaply allowing a much wider and faster dissemination of ideas and information. They had a significant impact on improving diet... They employed huge quantities of labour both directly and indirectly. They helped Britain to become the 'Workshop of the World' by reducing transport costs not only of raw materials but of finished goods, large amounts of which were exported... Today's global corporations originated with the great limited liability railway companies... By the third quarter of the nineteenth century, there was scarcely any person living in Britain whose life had not been altered in some way by the coming of the railways. Railways contributed to the transformation of Britain from a rural to a predominantly urban society.\nForeign policy.\nThe Great London Exhibition of 1851 clearly demonstrated Britain's dominance in engineering and industry; that lasted until the rise of the US and Germany in the 1890s. Using the imperial tools of free trade and financial investment, it exerted major influence on many countries outside Europe, especially in Latin America and Asia. Thus Britain had both a formal Empire based on British rule and an informal one based on the British pound.\nIn 1867, Britain united most of its North American colonies as Canada, giving it self-government. Britain handled foreign policy and defence. The second half of the 19th century saw a major expansion of Britain's colonial empire in Asia and Africa as well as the Pacific. In the \"Scramble for Africa\", the boast was having the Union Jack flying from \"Cairo to Cape Town.\" Britain defended its empire with the world's dominant navy, and a small professional army. It was the only power in Europe to have no conscription. The rise of the German Empire after 1871 posed a new challenge, for it threatened to take Britain's place as the world's foremost industrial power.\nIreland and Home Rule.\nPart of the agreement which led to the Acts of Union 1800 stipulated that the Penal Laws in Ireland were to be repealed and Catholic emancipation granted. However, King George III blocked emancipation. A campaign under Daniel O'Connell led to the concession of Catholic Emancipation in 1829, allowing Catholics to sit in Parliament.\nWhen potato blight hit Ireland in 1846, much of the rural population was left without food. Relief efforts were inadequate and hundreds of thousands died in the Great Hunger. Millions more migrated to England, or to North America. In the 1870s new moderate nationalist movement was formed. As the Irish Parliamentary Party it became a major factor in parliament under Charles Stewart Parnell. Home Rule Bills introduced by Liberal Prime Minister Gladstone failed of passage, and split the Liberals. A significant unionist minority, opposed Home Rule, fearing that a Catholic-Nationalist parliament in Dublin would discriminate against them and hurt its industry.\nLeadership.\nHistorically, the aristocracy was divided between Conservatives and Liberals. However, when Gladstone committed to home rule for Ireland, Britain's upper classes largely abandoned the Liberal party, giving the Conservatives a large permanent majority in the House of Lords. High Society in London, following the Queen, largely ostracised home rulers, and Liberal clubs were badly split. Joseph Chamberlain took a major element of upper-class supporters out of the Party and into a third party, the Liberal Unionists, which collaborated with and eventually merged into the Conservative party. The Gladstonian liberals in 1891 adopted the Newcastle Programme that included home rule for Ireland, disestablishment of the Church of England in Wales and Scotland, tighter controls on the sale of liquor, major extension of factory regulation, and democratic political reforms. The Programme had a strong appeal to the Nonconformist middle-class Liberal element, which felt liberated by the departure of the aristocracy.\nEarly 20th century (1901\u20131918).\nThe Liberal Party was in power from 1906 to 1915, when it formed a wartime coalition. It passed the welfare reforms that created a basic British welfare state. It weakened the veto power of Lords, blocked woman suffrage. In 1914 it apparently \"solved\" the problem of Irish Home Rule, but when the war broke out the solution was shelved. H. H. Asquith was Liberal Prime Minister between 1908 and 1916, followed by David Lloyd George, 1916\u20131922. Although Asquith was the Party leader, the dominant Liberal was Lloyd George. Asquith was overwhelmed by the wartime role of coalition prime minister, and Lloyd George replaced him as the coalition prime minister in 1916 but Asquith remained Liberal party leader. The two fought for years over control of the party, badly weakening it in the process. Historian Martin Pugh in \"The Oxford Companion to British History\" argues that Lloyd George:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;made a greater impact on British public life than any other 20th-century leader, thanks to his pre-war introduction of Britain's social welfare system (especially medical insurance, unemployment insurance, and...pensions...paid for by taxes on high incomes and on the land). ...he played a leading role in winning the First World War, redrawing the map of Europe at the peace conference, and partitioning Ireland.\nEdwardian era 1901\u20131914.\nQueen Victoria died in 1901 and her son Edward VII became king, inaugurating the Edwardian Era, which was characterised by ostentatious displays of wealth in contrast to the sombre Victorian Era. With the advent of the 20th century, things such as motion pictures, automobiles, and aeroplanes were coming into use. The new century was characterised by a feeling of optimism. The social reforms of the last century continued with the Labour Party being formed in 1900. Edward died in 1910, to be succeeded by George V, who reigned 1910\u20131936. Scandal-free, hard working and popular, George V was the British monarch who, with Queen Mary, established the modern pattern of conduct for British royalty, based on middle-class values and virtues.\nThe era was prosperous but political crises were escalating out of control. George Dangerfield (1935) identified the \"strange death of liberal England\" as the multiple crises that hit in 1910\u20131914 with serious social and political instability arising from the Irish crisis, labour unrest, the women's suffrage movements, and partisan and constitutional struggles in Parliament. At one point it even seemed the Army might refuse orders dealing with Northern Ireland. No solution appeared, when the unexpected outbreak of the Great War in 1914 put domestic issues on hold. Ross McKibbin argues that the political party system of the Edwardian era was in delicate balance on the eve of the war. The Liberals were in power with a progressive alliance of Labour and, off and on, Irish Nationalists. The coalition was committed to free trade (as opposed to the high tariffs the Conservatives sought), free collective bargaining for trades unions, an active social policy that was forging the welfare state, and constitutional reform to reduce the power of the House of Lords. The coalition lacked a long-term plan, because it was cobbled together. The sociological basis was non-Anglican religion and non-English ethnicity rather than the emerging class conflict emphasised by Labour.\nFirst World War.\nIn August 1914, Britain declared war on Germany and Austria. The cabinet's reasons focused on a commitment to France and avoidance of splitting the Liberal Party. Top Liberals led by Prime Minister H. H. Asquith and Foreign Secretary Edward Grey threatened to resign if the cabinet refused to support France. That would split the party and mean loss of control of the government to a coalition or Unionist (i.e. Conservative) opposition. However, the large antiwar element among Liberals, with David Lloyd George as spokesperson, would support the war to honour the Treaty of London (1839) that guaranteed Belgian neutrality. So Belgium rather than France was the public reason given.\nFrance had entered to support Russia, which in turn had entered to support Serbia. Britain became part of the Triple Entente with France and Russia, which fought the Central Powers of Germany, Austria and the Ottoman Empire. The Western Front turned into a killing ground in which millions died but no army made a large advance. The main British contribution was financial\u2014loans and grants helped Russia, Italy and smaller allies afford the war.\nThe stalemate required extensive supply of men and munitions. By 1916, volunteering fell off, the government imposed conscription (but not in Ireland) to keep up the strength of the Army. With his slow start and mobilisation of resources, Asquith had proven inadequate. Asquith was replaced in December 1916 with the more effective David Lloyd George. He had strong support from Unionists and considerable backing of Labour, as well as a majority of his Liberal Party. Lloyd George answered the demands for a more decisive government by setting up a small war cabinet, a cabinet secretariat under Maurice Hankey, and a secretariat of private advisors in 'The Garden Suburb'.\nIrish Nationalist opinion was divided: some served in the British Army, but the Irish Republican Brotherhood plotted an Easter Rising in 1916. It quickly failed but the brutal repression that followed turned that element against Britain, as did failed plans to introduce conscription in Ireland in 1917.\nThe nation mobilised its population, industry, finances, Empire and diplomacy, in league with France and the US, to defeat the Central Powers. The British Army had never been a large employer, with the regular army standing at 250,000 at the start of the war. By 1918, there were about five million in the army and the fledgling Royal Air Force, was about the same size of the pre-war army. The economy grew 14% from 1914 to 1918 despite the absence of so many men in the services; by contrast the German economy shrank 27%. The war saw a decline of civilian consumption, with a major reallocation to munitions. The government share of GDP soared from 8% in 1913 to 38% in 1918. Britain used up financial reserves and borrowed from the US.\nThe Royal Navy dominated the seas, defeating the smaller German fleet. Germany's naval strategy increasingly turned towards use of U-boats to strike back, despite the risk of triggering war with the powerful, hitherto neutral, US. In 1915, a U-boat, without warning, torpedoed the British passenger liner Lusitania, drowning over 1000 civilians, including 100 Americans. Protests by President Woodrow Wilson forced Berlin to abandon unrestricted submarine warfare. Planning a spring offensive in 1918, Germany resumed the sinking of all merchant ships, even if they were flying the American flag. The US entered the war alongside the Allies, and provided the needed money and supplies to sustain the Allies' efforts. The British, French, Australians, and Japanese seized Germany's colonies. Britain fought the Ottoman Empire, suffering defeats in the Gallipoli campaign and in Mesopotamia (Iraq). The Germans tried to win in spring 1918 before Americans arrived. They failed, were overwhelmed by August and accepted an Armistice on 11 November 1918, that amounted to a surrender.\nBritish society and government were radically transformed by the repeated calls for manpower, employment of women, dramatic increase in industrial production and munitions, price controls and rationing, and the wide and deep emotional patriotism dedicated to winning the war. Parliament took a backseat, as new departments, bureaus, committees and operations were created, experts consulted, and the prime minister's Orders in Council replaced the slow legislative process. Even after peace arrived, the new size and dynamism had permanently transformed the British government.\nVictorian attitudes and ideals that had continued into 20th century, changed during the First World War. The three million casualties were known as the \"Lost Generation\", and left society scarred. The lost generation felt its sacrifice was little regarded in Britain, with poems like Siegfried Sassoon's \"Blighters\" criticising the ill-informed jingoism of the home front. The lost generation was politically inert, and never had its chance to make a generational change in political power. The young men who governed Britain in 1914 were the same old men who governed Britain in 1939.\nPostwar settlement.\nThe war had been won by Britain and its allies, but at a terrible human and financial cost, creating a sentiment that wars should never be fought again. The League of Nations was founded with the idea that nations could resolve their differences peacefully, but these hopes were unfulfilled. The harsh peace settlement imposed on Germany would leave it embittered and seeking revenge.\nAt the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, Lloyd George, American President Woodrow Wilson and French premier Georges Clemenceau made all the major decisions. They sliced up the losers territories to form new nations in Europe, and divided up the German colonies and Ottoman holdings outside Turkey. They imposed what appeared to be heavy financial reparations. They humiliated Germany by forcing it to declare its guilt for starting the war, a policy that caused deep resentment in Germany and helped fuel Nazism. Britain gained the German colony of Tanganyika and part of Togoland in Africa, while its dominions added other colonies. Britain gained League of Nations mandates over Palestine, which had been partly promised as a homeland for Jewish settlers, and Iraq. Egypt, which had been a British protectorate since 1882, became independent in 1922.\nIrish independence and partition.\nIn 1912 the House of Commons passed a new Home Rule bill. Under the Parliament Act 1911 the House of Lords retained the power to delay legislation up to two years, so it was enacted as the Government of Ireland Act 1914, but suspended for the duration of the war. Civil war threatened when the Protestant-Unionists of Northern Ireland refused to be placed under Catholic-Nationalist control. Semi-military units were formed ready to fight\u2014the Unionist Ulster Volunteers opposed to the Act and their Nationalist counterparts, the Irish Volunteers supporting the Act. The outbreak of World War I put the crisis on hold. A disorganised Easter Rising in 1916 was brutally suppressed by the British, which had the effect of galvanizing Nationalist demands for independence. Prime Minister Lloyd George failed to introduce Home Rule in 1918 and in the General Election Sinn F\u00e9in won a majority of Irish seats. Its MPs refused to take their seats at Westminster, instead choosing to sit in the First D\u00e1il parliament in Dublin. A declaration of independence was ratified by D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, the self-declared Republic's parliament in January 1919. An Anglo-Irish War was fought between Crown forces and the Irish Republican Army between January 1919 and June 1921. The war ended with the Anglo-Irish Treaty of December 1921 that established the Irish Free State. Six northern, predominantly Protestant counties became Northern Ireland and have remained part of the United Kingdom ever since, despite demands of the Catholic minority to unite with the Republic of Ireland. Britain officially adopted the name \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\" by the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927.\nInterwar era 1918\u20131939.\nHistorian Arthur Marwick sees a radical transformation of British society resulting from the Great War, that swept away many old attitudes and brought in a more equalitarian society. He sees the famous literary pessimism of the 1920s as misplaced, arguing there were major positive long-term consequences of the war to British society. He points to an energised self-consciousness among workers that quickly built up the Labour Party, the coming of partial woman suffrage, and an acceleration of social reform and state control of the economy. He sees a decline of deference toward the aristocracy and established authority in general, and the weakening among youth of traditional restraints on individual moral behavior. The chaperone faded away; village druggists sold contraceptives. Marwick says that class distinctions softened, national cohesion increased, and British society became more equal.\nPopular culture.\nAs a leisure, literacy, wealth, ease of travel, and a broadened sense of community grew in Britain from the late 19th century onward, there was more time and interest in leisure activities of all sorts, on the part of all classes. The annual vacation became common. Tourists flocked to seaside resorts; Blackpool hosted 7 million visitors a year in the 1930s. Organised leisure was primarily a male activity, with middle-class women allowed in at the margins. There were class differences with upper-class clubs, and working-class and middle-class pubs. Heavy drinking declined; there were more competitions that attracted heavy betting. Participation in sports and all sorts of leisure activities increased for the average Englishman, and his interest in spectator sports increased dramatically. By the 1920s the cinema and radio attracted all classes, ages and genders in very large numbers, with young women taking the lead. Working-class men wearing flat caps and eating fish and chips were boisterous football spectators. They sang along at the music hall, fancied their pigeons, gambled on horse racing, and took the family to Blackpool in summer. The cartoon realisation of this life style \"Andy Capp\" began in 1957. Political activists complained that working-class leisure diverted men away from revolutionary agitation.\nCinema and radio.\nThe British film industry emerged in the 1890s when cinemas in general broke through in the western world, and built heavily on the strong reputation of the London legitimate theatre for actors, directors and producers. The problem was that the American market was so much larger and richer. It bought up the top talent, especially when Hollywood came to the fore in the 1920s and produced over 80 per cent of the total world output. Efforts to fight back were futile\u2014the government set a quota for British made films, but it failed. Hollywood furthermore dominated the lucrative Canadian and Australian markets. Bollywood (based in Bombay) dominated the huge Indian market. The most prominent directors remaining in London were Alexander Korda, an expatriate Hungarian, and Alfred Hitchcock. There was a revival of creativity in the 1933\u20131945 era, especially with the arrival of Jewish filmmakers and actors fleeing the Nazis. Meanwhile, giant palaces were built for the huge audiences that wanted to see Hollywood films. In Liverpool 40 per cent of the population attended one of the 69 cinemas once a week; 25 per cent went twice. Traditionalists grumbled about the American cultural invasion, but the permanent impact was minor.\nIn radio, British audiences had no choice apart from the upscale programming of the BBC, a government agency which had a monopoly on broadcasting. John Reith, an intensely moralistic engineer, was in full charge. His goal was to broadcast, \"All that is best in every department of human knowledge, endeavour and achievement... The preservation of a high moral tone is obviously of paramount importance.\"\nSports.\nThe British showed a more profound interest in sports, and in greater variety, than any rival. They gave pride of place to such moral issues as sportsmanship and fair play. Football proved highly attractive to the urban working classes, which introduced the rowdy spectator to the sports world. New games became popular almost overnight, including golf, lawn tennis, cycling and hockey. Women were much more likely to enter these sports than the old established ones. The aristocracy and landed gentry, with their ironclad control over land rights, dominated hunting, shooting, fishing and horse racing. Cricket reflected the Imperial spirit throughout the Empire (except Canada). Test matches began by the 1870s; the most famous are those between Australia and England for The Ashes.\nReading.\nAs literacy and leisure time expanded after 1900, reading became a popular pastime. New additions to adult fiction doubled during the 1920s, reaching 2800 new books a year by 1935. Libraries tripled their stock, and saw heavy demand for new fiction. A dramatic innovation was the inexpensive paperback, pioneered by Allen Lane at Penguin Books in 1935. The first titles included novels by Ernest Hemingway and Agatha Christie. They were sold cheap (usually sixpence) in a wide variety of inexpensive stores such as Woolworth's. Penguin aimed at an educated middle class \"middlebrow\" audience. It avoided the downmarket image of American paperbacks. The line signalled cultural self-improvement and political education. However the war years caused a shortage of staff for publishers and book stores, and a severe shortage of rationed paper, worsened by the air raid on Paternoster Square in 1940 that burned 5 million books in warehouses.\nRomantic fiction was especially popular, with Mills &amp; Boon the leading publisher. Romantic encounters were embodied in a principle of sexual purity that demonstrated not only social conservatism, but also how heroines could control their personal autonomy. Adventure magazines became quite popular, especially those published by DC Thomson; the publisher sent observers around the country to talk to boys and learn what they wanted to read about. The story line in magazines and cinema that most appealed to boys was the glamorous heroism of British soldiers fighting wars that were exciting and just.\nPolitics and economics of the 1920s.\nExpanding the welfare state.\nTwo major programmes that permanently expanded the welfare state passed in 1919 and 1920 with surprisingly little debate, even as the Conservatives dominated parliament. The Housing, Town Planning, &amp;c. Act 1919 set up a system of government housing that followed the 1918 campaign promises of \"homes fit for heroes.\" This \"Addison Act\", named after the first Minister of Health, Christopher Addison, required local authorities to survey their housing needs and start building houses to replace slums. The Treasury subsidised the low rents. In England and Wales 214,000 houses were built, and the Ministry of Health became largely a ministry of housing.\nThe Unemployment Insurance Act 1920 passed at a time of very little unemployment. It set up the dole system that provided 39 weeks of unemployment benefits to practically the entire civilian working population except domestic service, farm workers, and civil servants. Funded in part by weekly contributions from both employers and employed, it provided weekly payments of 15s for unemployed men and 12s for unemployed women. Historian C. L. Mowat calls these two laws \"Socialism by the back door\", and notes how surprised politicians were when the costs to the Treasury soared during the high unemployment of 1921.\nConservative control.\nThe Lloyd George ministry fell apart in 1922. Stanley Baldwin, as leader of the Conservative Party (1923\u20131937) and as Prime Minister (in 1923\u20131924, 1924\u20131929 and 1935\u20131937), dominated British politics. His mixture of strong social reforms and steady government proved a powerful election combination, with the result that the Conservatives governed Britain either by themselves or as the leading component of the National Government. He was the last party leader to win over 50% of the vote (in the general election of 1931). Baldwin's political strategy was to polarize the electorate so that voters would choose between the Conservatives on the right and the Labour Party on the left, squeezing out the Liberals in the middle. The polarisation did take place and while the Liberals remained active under Lloyd George, they won few seats and were a minor factor until they joined a coalition with the Conservatives in 2010. Baldwin's reputation soared in the 1920s and 1930s, but crashed after 1945 as he was blamed for the appeasement policies toward Germany, and as admirers of Churchill made him the Conservative icon. Since the 1970s Baldwin's reputation has recovered somewhat.\nLabour won the 1923 election, but in 1924 Baldwin and the Conservatives returned with a large majority.\nMcKibbin finds that the political culture of the interwar period was built around an anti-socialist middle class, supported by the Conservative leaders, especially Baldwin.\nEconomics.\nTaxes rose sharply during the war and never returned to their old levels. A rich man paid 8% of his income in taxes before the war, and about a third afterwards. Much of the money went for the dole, the weekly unemployment benefits. About 5% of the national income every year was transferred from the rich to the poor. A. J. P. Taylor argues most people \"were enjoying a richer life than any previously known in the history of the world: longer holidays, shorter hours, higher real wages.\"\nThe British economy was lackluster in the 1920s, with sharp declines and high unemployment in heavy industry and coal, especially in Scotland and Wales. Exports of coal and steel fell in half by 1939 and the business community was slow to adopt the new labour and management principles coming from the US, such as Fordism, consumer credit, eliminating surplus capacity, designing a more structured management, and using greater economies of scale. For over a century the shipping industry had dominated world trade, but it remained in the doldrums despite various stimulus efforts by the government. With the very sharp decline in world trade after 1929, its condition became critical.\nChancellor of the Exchequer Winston Churchill put Britain back on the gold standard in 1925, which many economists blame for the mediocre performance of the economy. Others point to a variety of factors, including the inflationary effects of the World War and supply-side shocks caused by reduced working hours after the war.\nBy the late 1920s, economic performance had stabilised, but the overall situation was disappointing, for Britain had fallen behind the United States as the leading industrial power. There also remained a strong economic divide between the north and south of England during this period, with the south of England and the Midlands fairly prosperous by the Thirties, while parts of south Wales and the industrial north of England became known as \"distressed areas\" due to particularly high rates of unemployment and poverty. Despite this, the standard of living continued to improve as local councils built new houses to let to families rehoused from outdated slums, with up to date facilities including indoor toilets, bathrooms and electric lighting now being included in the new properties. The private sector enjoyed a housebuilding boom during the 1930s.\nLabour.\nDuring the war, trade unions were encouraged and their membership grew from 4.1 million in 1914 to 6.5 million in 1918. They peaked at 8.3 million in 1920 before relapsing to 5.4 million in 1923.\nCoal was a sick industry; the best seams were being exhausted, raising the cost. Demand fell as oil began replacing coal for fuel. The 1926 general strike was a nine-day nationwide walkout of 1.3 million railwaymen, transport workers, printers, dockers, iron workers and steelworkers supporting the 1.2 million coal miners who had been locked out by the owners. The miners had rejected the owners' demands for longer hours and reduced pay in the face of falling prices. The Conservative government had provided a nine-month subsidy in 1925 but that was not enough to turn around a sick industry. To support the miners the Trades Union Congress (TUC), an umbrella organisation of all trades unions, called out certain critical unions. The hope was the government would intervene to reorganize and rationalize the industry, and raise the subsidy. The Conservative government had stockpiled supplies and essential services continued with middle class volunteers. All three major parties opposed the strike. The Labour Party leaders did not approve and feared it would tar the party with the image of radicalism, for the Comintern in Moscow had sent instructions for Communists to aggressively promote the strike. The general strike itself was largely non-violent, but the miners' lockout continued and there was violence in Scotland. It was the only general strike in British history, for TUC leaders such as Ernest Bevin considered it a mistake. Most historians treat it as a singular event with few long-term consequences, but Martin Pugh says it accelerated the movement of working-class voters to the Labour Party, which led to future gains. The Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927 made general strikes illegal and ended the automatic payment of union members to the Labour Party. That act was largely repealed in 1946. The coal industry used up the more accessible coal and as costs rose output fell from 2567 million tons in 1924 to 183 million in 1945. The Labour government nationalised the mines in 1947.\nGreat Depression.\nThe Great Depression originated in the United States in late 1929 and quickly spread to the world. Britain had never experienced the boom that had characterised the US, Germany, Canada and Australia in the 1920s, so its bust appeared less severe. Britain's world trade fell in half (1929\u20131933), the output of heavy industry fell by a third, employment profits plunged in nearly all sectors. At the depth in summer 1932, registered unemployed numbered 3.5 million, and many more had only part-time employment. Experts tried to remain optimistic. John Maynard Keynes, who had not predicted the slump, said, \"'There will be no serious direct consequences in London. We find the look ahead decidedly encouraging.\"\nOn the left figures such as Sidney and Beatrice Webb, J. A. Hobson, and G. D. H. Cole repeated the warnings they had been making for years about the imminent death of capitalism, only now far more people paid attention. Starting in 1935 the Left Book Club provided a new warning every month, and built up the credibility of Soviet-style socialism as an alternative.\nParticularly hardest hit by economic problems were the north of England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales; unemployment reached 70% in some areas at the start of the 1930s (with more than 3 million out of work nationally) and many families depended entirely on the dole.\nIn 1936, by which time unemployment was lower, 200 unemployed men made a highly publicised march from Jarrow to London in a bid to show the plight of the industrial poor. Although much romanticised by the Left, the Jarrow Crusade marked a deep split in the Labour Party and resulted in no government action. Unemployment remained high until the war absorbed all the job seekers. George Orwell's book \"The Road to Wigan Pier\" gives a bleak overview of the hardships of the time.\nAppeasement.\nVivid memories of the horrors and deaths of the World War made Britain and its leaders strongly inclined to pacifism in the interwar era. The challenge came from dictators, first Benito Mussolini of Italy, then Adolf Hitler of a much more powerful Nazi Germany. The League of Nations proved disappointing to its supporters; it was unable to resolve any of the threats posed by the dictators. British policy was to \"appease\" them in the hopes they would be satiated. By 1938 it was clear that war was looming, and that Germany had the world's most powerful military. The final act of appeasement came when Britain and France sacrificed Czechoslovakia to Hitler's demands at the Munich Agreement of 1938. Instead of satiation Hitler menaced Poland, and at last Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain dropped appeasement and stood firm in promising to defend Poland. Hitler however cut a deal with Joseph Stalin to divide Eastern Europe; when Germany did invade Poland in September 1939, Britain and France declared war; the British Commonwealth followed London's lead.\nWorld War II (1939\u20131945).\nThe King declared war on Nazi Germany in September 1939, after the German invasion of Poland. During the quiet period of \"Phoney War\", the British sent to France the most highly mechanised army in the world; together with France they had more tanks than Germany, but fewer warplanes. The smashing German victory in Spring 1940 was due entirely to \"superior combat doctrine. Realistic training, imaginative battlefield leadership, and unparalleled initiative from generals down to sergeants.\" The British with the thinnest of margins rescued its main army from Dunkirk (as well as many French soldiers), leaving all their equipment and war supplies behind. Winston Churchill came to power, promising to fight the Germans to the very end. The Germans threatened an invasion\u2014which the Royal Navy was prepared to repel. First the Germans tried to achieve air supremacy but were defeated by the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain in late summer 1940. Japan declared war in December 1941, and quickly seised Hong Kong, Malaya, Singapore, and Burma, and threatened Australia and India. Britain formed an alliance with the Soviet Union (starting in 1941) and very close ties to the United States (starting in 1940). The war was very expensive. It was paid for by high taxes, by selling off assets, and by accepting large amounts of Lend-Lease from the U.S. and Canada. The U.S. gave $30 billion in munitions; Canada also gave aid. (The American and Canadian aid did not have to be repaid, but there were also American loans that were repaid.)\nBritain's total mobilisation during this period proved to be successful in winning the war, by maintaining strong support from public opinion. The war was a \"people's war\" that enlarged democratic aspirations and produced promises of a postwar welfare state.\nThe media called it a \"people's war\"\u2014a term that caught on and signified the popular demand for planning and an expanded welfare state. The Royal family played major symbolic roles in the war. They refused to leave London during the Blitz and were indefatigable in visiting troops, munition factories, dockyards, and hospitals all over the country. All social classes appreciated how the royals shared the hopes, fears and hardships of the people.\nMobilisation of women.\nHistorians credit Britain with a highly successful record of mobilising the home front for the war effort, in terms of mobilising the greatest proportion of potential workers, maximising output, assigning the right skills to the right task, and maintaining the morale and spirit of the people.\nMuch of this success was due to the systematic planned mobilisation of women, as workers, soldiers and housewives, enforced after December 1941 by conscription. Women supported the war effort, and made the rationing of consumer goods a success. In some ways the government over-responded, evacuating too many children in the first days of the war, closing cinemas as frivolous then reopening them when the need for cheap entertainment became clear, sacrificing cats and dogs to save a little space on shipping pet food, only to discover an urgent need to keep rats and mice under control.\nThe British relied successfully on voluntarism. Munitions production rose dramatically, and the quality remained high. Food production was emphasised, in large part to free shipping for munitions. Farmers increased the area under cultivation from 12,000,000 to 18,000,000 acres (from about 50,000 to 75,000 km2), and the farm labour force was expanded by a fifth, thanks especially to the Women's Land Army.\nWelfare state.\nThe success of the government in providing new services, such as hospitals and school lunches, as well as egalitarian spirit, contributed to widespread support for an enlarged welfare state. It was supported by the coalition government and all major parties. Welfare conditions, especially regarding food, improved during the war as the government imposed rationing and subsidised food prices. Conditions for housing, however, worsened with the bombing, and clothing was in short supply.\nEquality increased dramatically, as incomes declined sharply for the wealthy and for white collar workers, as their taxes soared, while blue collar workers benefited from rationing and price controls.\nPeople demanded an expansion of the welfare state as a reward to the people for their wartime sacrifices. The goal was operationalised in a famous report by William Beveridge. It recommended that the various income maintenance services that had grown-up piecemeal since 1911 be systematised and made universal. Unemployment benefits and sickness benefits were to be universal. There would be new benefits for maternity. The old-age pension system would be revised and expanded, and require that a person retired. A full-scale National Health Service would provide free medical care for everyone. All the major parties endorsed the principles and they were largely put into effect when peace returned.\nPostwar.\nBritain had won the war, but it lost India in 1947 and nearly all the rest of the Empire by the 1960s. It debated its role in world affairs and joined the United Nations in 1945, NATO in 1949, and became a close ally of the United States. Prosperity returned in the 1950s, and London remained a world centre of finance and culture, but the nation was no longer a major world power. In 1973, after a long debate and initial rejection, it joined the Common Market.\nAusterity, 1945\u20131950.\nThe end of the war saw a landslide victory for Clement Attlee and the Labour Party. They were elected on a manifesto of greater social justice with left-wing policies such as the creation of a National Health Service, more council housing and nationalisation of several major industries. Britain faced a severe financial crisis, and responded by reducing her international responsibilities and by sharing the hardships of an \"age of austerity\". Large loans from the United States and Marshall Plan grants helped rebuild and modernise its infrastructure and business practices. Rationing and conscription dragged on well into the post war years, and the country suffered one of the worst winters on record. Nevertheless, morale was boosted by events such as the marriage of Princess Elizabeth in 1947 and the Festival of Britain in 1951.\nNationalisation.\nLabour Party leaders decided to act quickly to keep up the momentum of the 1945 electoral landslide. They began with the Bank of England, civil aviation, coal, and Cable &amp; Wireless. Then came railways, canals, road haulage and trucking, electricity, and gas. Finally came iron and steel. Altogether, about one fifth of the economy was nationalised. Labour dropped its plans to nationalise farmlands. The procedure used was developed by Herbert Morrison, who as Lord President of the Council chaired the Committee on the Socialisation of Industries. He followed the model already used to establish public corporations such as the BBC (1927). In exchange for shares, the owners of the companies were given government bonds paying low rates of interest, and the government took full ownership of each affected company, consolidating it into a national monopoly. The management remained the same, but they were now effectively civil servants working for the government.\nThere was no money for modernisation, although the Marshall Plan, operated separately by American planners, did force many British businesses to adopt modern managerial techniques. Hardline socialists were disappointed, as the nationalised industries seemed identical to the old private corporations, and national planning was made virtually impossible by the government's financial constraints. Workers had long been motivated to support Labour by reports of mistreatment of workers by management. The managers were the same people as before, with much the same power over the workplace. There was no worker control of industry. The unions resisted government efforts to set wages. By the time of the general elections in 1950 and 1951, Labour seldom discussed nationalisation of industry. Instead it was the Conservatives who decried the inefficiency and mismanagement, and promised to reverse the takeover of steel and trucking.\nProsperity of the postwar years.\nAs the country headed into the 1950s, rebuilding continued and immigrants from the remaining British Empire, mostly the Caribbean and Indian subcontinent, were invited to help rebuild. Britain lost its place as a superpower and could no longer maintain its empire. This led to decolonisation, and a withdrawal from almost all its colonies by 1970. Events such as the Suez Crisis showed the UK's status had fallen. The 1950s and 60s were however, prosperous, and saw modernisation of the UK, with the construction of its first motorways for example, and during the 1960s a cultural movement began which expanded across the world. Unemployment was low, new private and council housing development took place, and the number of slum properties diminished.\nThe postwar period witnessed a dramatic rise in the standard of living, as characterised by a 40% rise in average real wages from 1950 to 1965. The official workweek was reduced and reductions in income tax were made. Those in traditionally poorly paid semi-skilled and unskilled occupations saw a marked improvement in their wages and living standards. As summed up by R. J. Unstead,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBetween 1955-67, the average earnings of weekly-paid workers increased by 96% and those of salaried workers by 95%, while prices rose by about 45%, enabling people to afford more consumer goods. Between 1964-68, the percentage of households with a television set rose from 81% to 86%, a washing machine from 54% to 63%, a refrigerator from 35% to 55%, a car from 38% to 49%, a telephone from 22% to 28%, and central heating from 13% to 23%. The rising affluence was underpinned by full employment. Economic growth remained at about 3%. Food rations were lifted in 1954, while hire-purchase controls were relaxed. Many of the working classes were able to participate in the consumer market for the first time.\nAs noted by Harriet Wilson,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;National wealth has grown considerably, and although the shareout of this among the social classes has remained substantially of the same proportions, it has meant a considerable rise in the standard of living of all classes. It is estimated that in Britain at the turn of the century average earnings in industry sufficed merely to meet the essential needs of a two-child family, today average earnings allow the industrial wage-earner to spend a third of his income on things other than basic needs.\nThe significant real wage increases in the 1950s and 1960s contributed to a rapid increase in working-class consumerism, with British consumer spending rising by 45% between 1952 and 1964. Entitlement to benefits was improved. In 1955, 96% of manual labourers were entitled to two weeks' holiday with pay, compared with 61% in 1951. By the end of the 1950s, Britain had become one of the world's most affluent countries, and by the early Sixties, most Britons enjoyed a level of prosperity previously known only to a small minority. For the young and unattached, there was, for the first time in decades, spare cash for leisure, clothes, and luxuries. In 1959, \"Queen\" magazine declared that \"Britain has launched into an age of unparalleled lavish living.\" Prime Minister Harold Macmillan claimed that \"the luxuries of the rich have become the necessities of the poor.\" Levels of disposable income rose steadily, with the spending power of the average family rising by 50% between 1951 and 1979, and by the end of the Seventies, 6 out of 10 families owned a car.\nAs noted by Martin Pugh,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Keynesian economic management enabled British workers to enjoy a golden age of full employment which, combined with a more relaxed attitude towards working mothers, led to the spread of the two-income family. Inflation was around 4 per cent, money wages rose from an average of \u00a38 a week in 1951 to \u00a315 a week by 1961, home-ownership spread from 35 per cent in 1939 to 47 per cent by 1966, and the relaxation of credit controls boosted the demand for consumer goods.\nAs noted by John Burnett,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What was equally striking was that ownership of [consumer goods] had spread down the social scale and the gap between professional and manual workers had considerably narrowed.\nA study of a slum area in Leeds (due for demolition) found 74% of the households had a television, 41% a vacuum, and 38% a washing machine. In another slum area, St Mary's in Oldham (where in 1970 few of the houses had fixed baths or a hot water supply and half shared outside toilets), 67% of the houses were comfortably furnished and a further 24% furnished luxuriously, with smart modern furniture, deep pile carpeting, and decorations. \nThe provision of household amenities steadily improved during the second half of the twentieth century. From 1971 to 1983, households having the sole use of a fixed bath or shower rose from 88% to 97%, and those with an internal WC from 87% to 97%. Households with central heating almost doubled, from 34% to 64%. By 1983, 94% of all households had a refrigerator, 81% a colour television, 80% a washing machine, 57% a deep freezer, and 28% a tumble-drier.\nBetween 1950 and 1970, however, Britain was overtaken by most countries of the European Common Market in terms of telephones, refrigerators, televisions, cars, and washing machines per 100 of the population (though Britain remained high in terms of bathrooms and lavatories). Although the British standard of living was increasing, the standard of living in other countries increased faster. According to a 1968 study by Anthony Sampson, British workers:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In ten years, from having had a much higher standard of living than the continent, they have slipped right back. Taking the national income per head (a rough yardstick), the British by 1967 had sunk to eighth place among OECD countries, with an annual income of $1,910 compared with $2,010 for Germany, $2,060 for France and $2,480 for Switzerland: and Britain's falling position already shows itself in the lower proportion of new cars and new houses (though still leading with TV sets and washing machines).\"\nIn 1950, the standard of living was higher than in any EEC country apart from Belgium. It was 50% higher than West Germany, and twice as high as Italy. In 1976, UK wages were amongst the lowest in Western Europe, being half of West German rates and two-thirds of Italian rates. In addition, while educational opportunities for working-class people had widened significantly since the end of the war, a number of developed countries came to overtake Britain in some educational indicators. By the early 1980s, some 80% to 90% of school leavers in France and West Germany received vocational training, compared with 40% in the UK. By the mid-1980s, over 80% of pupils in the US and West Germany and over 90% in Japan stayed in education until 18, compared with 33% of British pupils. In 1987, only 35% of 16- to 18-year-olds were in full-time education or training, compared with 80% in the US, 77% in Japan, 69% in France. There remained gaps between manual and non-manual workers in areas such as benefits and wages. In 1978 male full-time manual workers aged 21 and above averaged a gross weekly wage of \u00a380, while the equivalent for male white collar workers stood at \u00a3100.\nEmpire to Commonwealth.\nBritain's control over its Empire loosened during the interwar period. Nationalism strengthened in other parts of the empire, particularly in India and in Egypt.\nBetween 1867 and 1910, the UK had granted Australia, Canada, and New Zealand \"Dominion\" status (near complete autonomy within the Empire). They became charter members of the British Commonwealth of Nations (known as the Commonwealth of Nations since 1949), an informal but close-knit association that succeeded the British Empire. Beginning with the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947, the remainder of the British Empire was almost completely dismantled. Today, most of Britain's former colonies belong to the Commonwealth, almost all of them as independent members. There are, however, 13 former British colonies, including Bermuda, Gibraltar, the Falkland Islands, and others, which have elected to continue rule by London and are known as British Overseas Territories.\nFrom the Troubles to the Belfast Agreement.\nIn the 1960s, moderate unionist Prime Minister of Northern Ireland Terence O'Neill tried to reform the system and give a greater voice to Catholics who comprised 40% of the population of Northern Ireland. His goals were blocked by militant Protestants led by the Rev. Ian Paisley. The increasing pressures from nationalists for reform and from unionists to resist reform led to the appearance of the civil rights movement under figures like John Hume, Austin Currie and others. Clashes escalated out of control as the army could barely contain the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and the Ulster Defence Association. British leaders feared their withdrawal would give a \"Doomsday Scenario\", with widespread communal strife, followed by the mass exodus of hundreds of thousands of refugees. London shut down Northern Ireland's parliament and began direct rule. By the 1990s, the failure of the IRA campaign to win mass public support or achieve its aim of a British withdrawal led to negotiations that in 1998 produced the 'Good Friday Agreement'. It won popular support and largely ended the Troubles.\nThe economy in the late 20th century.\nAfter the relative prosperity of the 1950s and 1960s, the UK experienced industrial strife and stagflation through the 1970s following a global economic downturn; Labour had returned to government in 1964 under Harold Wilson to end 13 years of Conservative rule. The Conservatives were restored to government in 1970 under Edward Heath, who failed to halt the country's economic decline and was ousted in 1974 as Labour returned to power under Harold Wilson. The economic crisis deepened following Wilson's return and things fared little better under his successor James Callaghan.\nA strict modernisation of its economy began under the controversial Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher following her election as prime minister in 1979, which saw a time of record unemployment as deindustrialisation saw the end of much of the country's manufacturing industries, but also a time of economic boom as stock markets became liberalised and state-owned industries were privatised. Her rise to power was seen as the symbolic end of the time in which the British economy had become the \"sick man\" of western Europe. Inflation also fell during this period and trade union power was reduced.\nHowever the miners' strike of 1984\u20131985 prefigured the end of most of the UK's coal mining. The exploitation of North Sea gas and oil brought in substantial tax and export revenues to aid the new economic boom. This was also the time that the IRA took the issue of Northern Ireland to Great Britain, maintaining a prolonged bombing campaign on the British mainland.\nAfter the economic boom of the 1980s a brief but severe recession occurred between 1990 and 1992 following the economic chaos of Black Wednesday under government of John Major, who had succeeded Margaret Thatcher in 1990. However the rest of the 1990s saw the beginning of a period of continuous economic growth that lasted over 16 years. It was expanded under the so-called New Labour government of Tony Blair following his landslide election victory in 1997. The rejuvenated Labour party abandoned its commitment to policies including nuclear disarmament and nationalisation of key industries, and no reversal of the Thatcher-led union reforms. It emphasised an appeal to the better-educated voter.\nFrom 1964 up until 1996, income per head had doubled, while ownership of various household goods had significantly increased. By 1996, two-thirds of households owned cars, 82% had central heating, most people owned a VCR, and one in five houses had a home computer. In 1971, 9% of households had no access to a shower or bathroom, compared with only 1% in 1990; largely due to demolition or modernisation of older properties which lacked such facilities. In 1971, only 35% had central heating, while 78% enjoyed this amenity in 1990. By 1990, 93% of households had colour television, 87% had telephones, 86% had washing machines, 80% had deep-freezers, 60% had video-recorders, and 47% had microwave ovens. Holiday entitlements had also become more generous. In 1990, nine out of ten full-time manual workers were entitled to more than four weeks of paid holiday a year, while twenty years previously only two-thirds had been allowed three weeks or more.\nThe postwar period also witnessed significant improvements in housing conditions. In 1960, 14% of British households had no inside toilet, while in 1967 22% of all homes had no basic hot water supply. By the 1990s, most homes had these amenities together with central heating. From 1996\u20131997 to 2006\u20132007, real median household income increased by 20% while real mean household incomes increased by 23%. There has also been a shift towards a service-based economy in the years following the end of the Second World War, with 11% of working people employed in manufacturing in 2006, compared with 25% in 1971.\nCommon Market (EEC), then EU, membership.\nBritain's wish to join the Common Market (as the European Economic Community was known in Britain) was first expressed in July 1961 by the Macmillan government. It was vetoed in 1963 by French President Charles de Gaulle. After initially hesitating over the issue, Harold Wilson's Labour Government lodged the UK's second application (in May 1967) to join the Community. Like the first, though, it was vetoed by de Gaulle.\nIn 1973, with de Gaulle gone, Conservative Prime Minister Heath negotiated terms for admission and Britain finally joined the Community. In opposition the Labour Party was deeply divided, though its Leader, Harold Wilson, remained in favour. In the 1974 General Election the Labour Party manifesto included a pledge to renegotiate terms for Britain's membership and then hold a referendum on whether to stay in the EC on the new terms. This was a constitutional procedure without precedent in British history. In the subsequent referendum campaign, rather than the normal British tradition of \"collective responsibility\", under which the government takes a policy position which all cabinet members are required to support publicly, members of the Government (and the Conservative opposition) were free to present their views on either side of the question. A referendum was duly held on 5 June 1975, and the proposition to continue membership was passed with a substantial majority.\nThe Single European Act (SEA) was the first major revision of the 1957 Treaty of Rome. In 1987, the Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher enacted it into UK law.\nThe Maastricht Treaty transformed the European Community into the European Union. In 1992, the Conservative government under John Major ratified it, against the opposition of his backbench Maastricht Rebels.\nThe Lisbon Treaty introduced many changes to the treaties of the Union. Prominent changes included more qualified majority voting in the Council of Ministers, increased involvement of the European Parliament in the legislative process through extended codecision with the Council of Ministers, eliminating the pillar system and the creation of a President of the European Council with a term of two and a half years and a High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to present a united position on EU policies. The Treaty of Lisbon made the Union's human rights charter, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, legally binding. The Lisbon Treaty led to an increase in the voting weight of the UK in the Council of the European Union from 8.4% to 12.4%. In July 2008, the Labour government under Gordon Brown approved the treaty and the Queen ratified it.\nDevolution for Scotland and Wales.\nOn 11 September 1997, the 700th anniversary of the Scottish victory over the English at the Battle of Stirling Bridge, a referendum was held on establishing a devolved Scottish Parliament. This resulted in an overwhelming 'yes' vote both to establishing the parliament and granting it limited tax varying powers. One week later, a referendum in Wales on establishing a Welsh Assembly was also approved but with a very narrow majority. The first elections were held, and these bodies began to operate in 1999. The creation of these bodies has widened the differences between the countries of the United Kingdom, especially in areas like healthcare. It has also brought to the fore the so-called West Lothian question which is a complaint that devolution for Scotland and Wales but not England has created a situation where Scottish and Welsh MPs in the UK Parliament can, in principle, vote on internal matters affecting England alone whereas English MPs have no say in similar matters affecting Scotland and Wales.\n21st century.\nWar in Afghanistan and Iraq.\nIn the 2001 General Election, the Labour Party won a second successive victory, though voter turnout dropped to the lowest level for 80 years. The September 11 attacks in the US led to President George W. Bush launching the war on terror, beginning with the invasion of Afghanistan aided by British troops in October 2001. Thereafter, with the US focus shifting to Iraq, Tony Blair convinced the Labour and Conservative MPs to vote in favour of supporting the 2003 invasion of Iraq, despite huge anti-war marches held in London and Glasgow. Forty-six thousand British troops, one-third of the total strength of the Army's land forces, were deployed to assist with the invasion and British forces were responsible for security in southern Iraq. All British forces were withdrawn in 2010.\nThe Labour Party Prime Minister Tony Blair won the 2005 British general election and a third consecutive term. On 7 July 2005, a series of four suicide bombings struck London, killing 52 commuters along with the four bombers, and injuring hundreds.\n2008 economic crisis.\nIn the wake of the Great Recession, the economy contracted. The announcement in 2008 that the economy had shrunk for the first time since 1992, ended 16 years of continuous growth. Causes included an end to the easy credit, reduction in consumption and substantial depreciation of sterling (which fell 25% against the euro between January 2008 and January 2009), leading to increased import costs, notably of oil.\nOn 8 October 2008, the British Government announced a bank rescue package of around \u00a3500 billion ($850 billion at the time). The plan comprised three parts: \u00a3200 billion to be made available to the banks in the Bank of England's Special Liquidity Scheme; the Government increased the banks' market capitalisation, with an initial \u00a325 billion; and the Government underwrote any eligible lending between British banks up to around \u00a3250 billion. With the UK coming out of recession in the fourth quarter of 2009\u2014ending six consecutive quarters of economic decline\u2014the Bank of England decided against further quantitative easing.\nScottish independence.\nFollowing the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, the pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP) won their first victory. They formed a minority government with plans to hold a referendum before 2011 to seek a mandate \"to negotiate with the Government of the United Kingdom to achieve independence for Scotland.\" Unionist parties responded by establishing the Calman Commission to examine further devolution of powers. Responding to the findings of the review, the UK government issued a white paper in 2009, on new powers that would be devolved to the Scottish Government, notably on how it can raise tax. These proposals would ultimately form the basis of the Scotland Act 2012.\nThe 2011 election saw a decisive victory for the SNP which was able to form a majority government intent on delivering a referendum on independence. Prime Minister David Cameron guaranteed the UK government would not put any legal or political obstacles in the way of such a referendum. On 18 September 2014, a referendum was held in Scotland on whether to leave the UK. The three UK-wide political parties\u2014Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrats\u2014campaigned together as part of the Better Together campaign while the pro-independence Scottish National Party was the main force in the Yes Scotland campaign. Days before the vote, with the opinion polls closing, the three Better Together party leaders issued 'The Vow', a promise of more powers for Scotland in the event of a No vote. The referendum resulted in Scotland voting by 55% to 45% to remain part of the UK. First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond resigned, succeeded by Nicola Sturgeon. Advocating for a second referendum, she would lead the SNP to victory in the 2016 and 2021 elections.\n2010 coalition government.\nThe 2010 general election resulted in the first hung parliament since 1974, with the Conservative Party winning the largest number of seats, but falling short of the 326 required for a majority. The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats agreed to form the first coalition government for the UK since the Second World War, with David Cameron becoming Prime Minister and Nick Clegg Deputy Prime Minister.\nBritish military aircraft participated in the UN-mandated intervention in the 2011 Libyan civil war, flying 3,000 air sorties against forces loyal to dictator Muammar Gaddafi. 2011 saw England suffer unprecedented rioting in its major cities in August, killing five and causing \u00a3200m worth of damage. In October 2011, the prime ministers of the Commonwealth realms voted to grant gender equality in the royal succession. The amendment ended the ban on the monarch marrying a Catholic.\n2015 election.\nThe 2015 election was held on 7 May with polls predicting a hung parliament. The Conservative Party won a narrow majority in parliament. The other most significant result was the Scottish National Party winning all but three of the 59 seats in Scotland. This was because of a surge in support following the 2014 independence referendum, and SNP party membership had quadrupled; 1 in every 50 of the population of Scotland was a member.\nLabour suffered its worst defeat since 1987, taking only 31% of the votes and losing 40 of its 41 seats in Scotland. The Liberal Democrats lost 49 of their 57 seats, as they were punished for their decision to form a coalition with the conservatives. The UK Independence Party (UKIP), rallying voters against the EU and uncontrolled immigration, secured 13%, but won only one seat. Cameron had a mandate for his austerity policies to shrink the size of government, and a challenge in dealing with Scotland. Likewise the Green Party saw a rise in support but retained just its one seat.\n2016 EU membership referendum.\nIn February 2016, Prime Minister Cameron announced that a referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union would be held on 23 June 2016, following years of campaigning by eurosceptics. Campaigns by parties supporting both \"Remain\" (Britain Stronger in Europe) and \"Leave\" (Vote Leave) focused on concerns regarding trade and the European single market, security, migration and sovereignty. The result of the referendum was in favour of the country leaving the EU with 52% of voters wanting to leave. Cameron resigned, with Theresa May succeeding him as Prime Minister.\nThe UK remained a member of the EU, but invoked Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty in March 2017. This started negotiations on a withdrawal agreement, before an exit from the EU (Brexit) intended for March 2019 but later extended, to early 2020.\nDuring the 2016 referendum, Boris Johnson became a leading proponent of Vote Leave. By 2019, Johnson was Prime Minister and pushed hard for an exit on 31 October 2019. Commentator Jonathan Freedland argued in summer 2019 that the Britain was in the grip of a populism that is trampling on the norms and constraints of liberal democracy, that is contemplating a collective act of self-harm without precedent, that is bracing itself for disruption, shortages, even civil unrest unknown in peacetime. This is not the consequence of unavoidable war or an unforeseen natural disaster, but is entirely of the country's own making.\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\nCOVID was confirmed to be spreading in the UK by the end of January 2020 with the first confirmed deaths in March. The country was initially slow in implementing restrictions. Subsequent epidemiological analysis showed that over 1000 lineages of SARS-CoV-2 entered the UK in early 2020 from international travellers, mostly from outbreaks elsewhere in Europe. A legally enforced lockdown was introduced on 23 March. Restrictions were eased in late spring. The UK's epidemic in early 2020 was one of the largest and deadliest worldwide.\nBy the Autumn, cases were again rising. This led to the creation of new regulations along with local lockdowns, in more specific geographic locations than the four nations of the UK. Lockdowns took place in Wales, England and Northern Ireland later that season. Once restrictions were lifted, a novel variant rapidly spread across the UK. The NHS had come under severe strain by late December. This led to a tightening of restrictions.\nThe first vaccine was approved and began its rollout in the UK in December 2020. By August 2021 more than 75% of adults in the UK were fully vaccinated against COVID. Restrictions began to ease from late February and almost all had ended in Britain by August. \nGovernment crises and Sunak Ministry (2022\u20132024).\nIn 2022, the UK government faced multiple crises. The Partygate scandal, involving lockdown rule breaches by government officials, led to fines, including for Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak. Johnson faced calls to resign, and after the Chris Pincher scandal, he stepped down in July 2022. Liz Truss succeeded Johnson but her September mini-budget triggered market instability, leading to the dismissal of Kwasi Kwarteng and Truss's resignation in October.\nRishi Sunak became the first Asian Prime Minister on 25 October 2022. \nLabour government (2024\u2013present).\nOn 4 July 2024, the Labour Party won a landslide victory in general election, meaning Labour Party leader Keir Starmer became Britain's new prime minister. Following the fatal stabbing of three girls in Southport, misinformation spread falsely accusing the perpetrator as being a Muslim, sparking the 2024 United Kingdom riots as a backlash against immigration to the UK.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistoriography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPrimary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The United Kingdom is made up of four countries \u2013 England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. With a total area of approximately , the UK occupies the major part of the British Isles archipelago and includes the island of Great Britain, the north-eastern one-sixth of the island of Ireland and many smaller surrounding islands. It is the world's 7th largest island country. The mainland areas lie between latitudes 49\u00b0N and 59\u00b0N (the Shetland Islands reach to nearly 61\u00b0N), and longitudes 8\u00b0W to 2\u00b0E. The Royal Observatory, Greenwich, in south-east London, is the defining point of the Prime Meridian.\nThe UK lies between the North Atlantic and the North Sea, and comes within of the north-west coast of France, from which it is separated by the English Channel. It shares a international land boundary with the Republic of Ireland. The Channel Tunnel bored beneath the English Channel now links the UK with France.\nThe British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies are covered in their own respective articles, see below.\nArea.\nThe total area of the United Kingdom according to the Office for National Statistics is , comprising the island of Great Britain, the northeastern one-sixth of the island of Ireland (Northern Ireland) and many smaller islands. This makes it the 7th largest island country in the world. England is the largest country of the United Kingdom, at accounting for just over half the total area of the UK. Scotland at , is second largest, accounting for about a third of the area of the UK. Wales and Northern Ireland are much smaller, covering respectively.\nThe area of the countries of the United Kingdom is set out in the table below. Information about the area of England, the largest country, is also broken down by region.\nThe British Antarctic Territory, which covers an area of is geographically the largest of the British Overseas Territories followed by the Falkland Islands which covers an area of . The remaining twelve overseas territories cover an area .\nOther countries with very similar land areas to the United Kingdom include Guinea (slightly larger), Uganda, Ghana and Romania (all slightly smaller). The UK is the world's 80th largest country by land area and the 10th largest in Europe (if European Russia is included).\nPhysical geography.\nThe physical geography of the UK varies greatly. England consists of mostly lowland terrain, with upland or mountainous terrain only found north-west of the Tees\u2013Exe line. The upland areas include the Lake District, the Pennines, North York Moors, Exmoor and Dartmoor. The lowland areas are typically traversed by ranges of low hills, frequently composed of chalk, and flat plains. Scotland is the most mountainous country in the UK and its physical geography is distinguished by the Highland Boundary Fault which traverses the Scottish mainland from Helensburgh to Stonehaven. The faultline separates the two distinctively different regions of the Highlands to the north and west, and the Lowlands to the south and east. The Highlands are predominantly mountainous, containing the majority of Scotland's mountainous landscape, while the Lowlands contain flatter land, especially across the Central Lowlands, with upland and mountainous terrain located at the Southern Uplands. Wales is mostly mountainous, though south Wales is less mountainous than north and mid Wales. Northern Ireland consists of mostly hilly landscape and its geography includes the Mourne Mountains as well as Lough Neagh, at , the largest body of water in the UK.\nThe overall geomorphology of the UK was shaped by a combination of forces including tectonics and climate change, in particular glaciation in northern and western areas.\nThe tallest mountain in the UK (and British Isles) is Ben Nevis, in the Grampian Mountains, Scotland. The longest river is the River Severn which flows from Wales into England. The largest lake by surface area is Lough Neagh in Northern Ireland, though Scotland's Loch Ness has the largest volume.\nGeology.\nThe geology of the UK is complex and diverse, a result of it being subject to a variety of plate tectonic processes over a very extended period of time. Changing latitude and sea levels have been important factors in the nature of sedimentary sequences, whilst successive continental collisions have affected its geological structure with major faulting and folding being a legacy of each orogeny (mountain-building period), often associated with volcanic activity and the metamorphism of existing rock sequences. As a result of this eventful geological history, the UK shows a rich variety of landscapes.\nPrecambrian.\nThe oldest rocks in the British Isles are the Lewisian gneisses, metamorphic rocks found in the far north-west of Scotland and in the Hebrides (with a few small outcrops elsewhere), which date from at least 2,700 Ma (Ma = million years ago). South and east of the gneisses are a complex mixture of rocks forming the North West Highlands and Grampian Highlands in Scotland. These are essentially the remains of folded sedimentary rocks that were deposited between 1,000 Ma and 670 Ma over the gneiss on what was then the floor of the Iapetus Ocean.\nPalaeozoic.\nAt 520 Ma, what is now Great Britain was split between two continents; the north of Scotland was located on the continent of Laurentia at about 20\u00b0 south of the equator, while the rest of the country was on the continent of Gondwana near the Antarctic Circle. In Gondwana, England and Wales were largely submerged under a shallow sea studded with volcanic islands. The remains of these islands underlie much of central England with small outcrops visible in many places.\nAbout 500 Ma southern Britain, the east coast of North America and south-east Newfoundland broke away from Gondwana to form the continent of Avalonia, which by 440 Ma had drifted to about 30\u00b0 south. During this period north Wales was subject to volcanic activity. The remains of these volcanoes are still visible, one example of which is Rhobell Fawr dating from 510 Ma. Large quantities of volcanic lava and ash known as the Borrowdale Volcanics covered the Lake District and this can still be seen in the form of mountains such as Helvellyn and Scafell Pike.\nBetween 425 and 400 Ma Avalonia had joined with the continent of Baltica, and the combined landmass collided with Laurentia at about 20\u00b0 south, joining the southern and northern halves of Great Britain together. The resulting Caledonian Orogeny produced an Alpine-style mountain range in much of north and west Britain.\nThe collision between continents continued during the Devonian period, producing uplift and subsequent erosion, resulting in the deposition of numerous sedimentary rock layers in lowlands and seas. The Old Red Sandstone and the contemporary volcanics and marine sediments found in Devon originated from these processes.\nAround 360 Ma Great Britain was lying at the equator, covered by the warm shallow waters of the Rheic Ocean, during which time the Carboniferous Limestone was deposited, as found in the Mendip Hills and the Peak District of Derbyshire. Later, river deltas formed and the sediments deposited were colonised by swamps and rain forest. It was in this environment that the Coal Measures were formed, the source of the majority of Britain's extensive coal reserves.\nAround 280 Ma the Variscan orogeny mountain-building period occurred, again due to collision of continental plates, causing major deformation in south-west England. The general region of Variscan folding was south of an east\u2013west line roughly from south Pembrokeshire to Kent. Towards the end of this period granite was formed beneath the overlying rocks of Devon and Cornwall, now exposed at Dartmoor and Bodmin Moor.\nBy the end of the Carboniferous period the various continents of the Earth had fused to form the super-continent of Pangaea. Britain was located in the interior of Pangea where it was subject to a hot arid desert climate with frequent flash floods leaving deposits that formed beds of red sedimentary rock.\nMesozoic.\nAs Pangaea drifted during the Triassic, Great Britain moved away from the equator until it was between 20\u00b0 and 30\u00b0 north. The remnants of the Variscan uplands in France to the south were eroded down, resulting in layers of the New Red Sandstone being deposited across central England.\nPangaea began to break up at the start of the Jurassic period. Sea levels rose and Britain drifted on the Eurasian Plate to between 31\u00b0 and 40\u00b0 north. Much of Britain was under water again, and sedimentary rocks were deposited and can now be found underlying much of England from the Cleveland Hills of Yorkshire to the Jurassic Coast in Dorset. These include sandstones, greensands, oolitic limestone of the Cotswold Hills, corallian limestone of the Vale of White Horse and the Isle of Portland. The burial of algae and bacteria below the mud of the seafloor during this time resulted in the formation of North Sea oil and natural gas.\nThe modern continents having formed, the Cretaceous saw the formation of the Atlantic Ocean, gradually separating northern Scotland from North America. The land underwent a series of uplifts to form a fertile plain. After 20 million years or so, the seas started to flood the land again until much of Britain was again below the sea, though sea levels frequently changed. Chalk and flints were deposited over much of Great Britain, now notably exposed at the White Cliffs of Dover and the Seven Sisters, and also forming Salisbury Plain.\nCenozoic.\nBetween 63 and 52 Ma, the last volcanic rocks in Great Britain were formed. The major eruptions at this time produced the Antrim Plateau, the basaltic columns of the Giant's Causeway and Lundy Island in the Bristol Channel.\nThe Alpine Orogeny that took place in Europe about 50 Ma, was responsible for the folding of strata in southern England, producing the London Basin syncline, the Weald-Artois Anticline to the south, the North Downs, South Downs and Chiltern Hills.\nDuring the period the North Sea formed, Britain was uplifted. Some of this uplift was along old lines of weakness left from the Caledonian and Variscan Orogenies long before. The uplifted areas were then eroded, and further sediments, such as the London Clay, were deposited over southern England.\nThe major changes during the last 2 million years were brought about by several recent ice ages. The most severe was the Anglian Glaciation, with ice up to thick that reached as far south as London and Bristol. This took place between about 478,000 to 424,000 years ago, and was responsible for the diversion of the River Thames onto its present course. During the most recent Devensian glaciation, which ended a mere 10,000 years ago, the icesheet reached south to Wolverhampton and Cardiff. Among the features left behind by the ice are the fjords of the west coast of Scotland, the U-shaped valleys of the Lake District and erratics (blocks of rock) that have been transported from the Oslo region of Norway and deposited on the coast of Yorkshire.\nAmongst the most significant geological features created during the last twelve thousand years are the peat deposits of Scotland, and of coastal and upland areas of England and Wales.\nAt the present time Scotland is continuing to rise as a result of the weight of Devensian ice being lifted. Southern and eastern England is sinking, generally estimated at 1\u00a0mm (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u204425\u00a0in) per year, with the London area sinking at double the speed partly due to the continuing compaction of the recent clay deposits.\nMountains and hills.\nThe ten tallest mountains in the UK are all found in Scotland. The highest peaks in each part of the UK are:\nThe ranges of mountains and hills in the UK include:\nThe lowest point of the UK is in the Fens of East Anglia, in England, parts of which lie up to below sea level.\nRivers and lakes.\nThe longest river in the UK is the River Severn () which flows through both Wales and England.\nThe longest rivers in the UK contained fully within each of its constituent nations are:\nThe largest lakes (by surface area) in the UK by country are:\nThe deepest lake in the UK is Loch Morar with a maximum depth of ; Loch Ness is second at deep. The deepest lake in England is Wastwater which achieves a depth of .\nLoch Ness is the UK's largest lake in terms of volume.\nArtificial waterways.\n\"Main articles:\" Waterways in the United Kingdom, Canals of Great Britain, Dams and reservoirs in United Kingdom\nAs a result of its industrial history, the United Kingdom has an extensive system of canals, mostly built in the early years of the Industrial Revolution, before the rise of competition from the railways. The United Kingdom also has numerous dams and reservoirs to store water for drinking and industry. The generation of hydroelectric power is rather limited, supplying less than 2% of British electricity, mainly from the Scottish Highlands.\nCoastline.\nThe UK has a coastline which measures about . The heavy indentation of the coastline helps to ensure that no location is more than from tidal waters.\nThe UK claims jurisdiction over the continental shelf, as defined in continental shelf orders or in accordance with agreed upon boundaries, an exclusive fishing zone of , and territorial sea of .\nThe UK has an Exclusive Economic Zone of in Europe. However, if all crown dependencies and overseas territories are included then the total EEZ is which is the 5th largest in the world.\nHeadlands.\nThe geology of the United Kingdom is such that there are many headlands along its coast. A list of headlands of the United Kingdom details many of them.\nTidal flats.\nA recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were of tidal flats in the United Kingdom, making it the 12th ranking country in terms of how much tidal flat occurs there.\nIslands.\nIn total, it is estimated that the UK is made up of over one thousand small islands, the majority located off the north and west coasts of Scotland. About 130 of these are inhabited according to the 2001 census.\nThe largest island in the UK is Great Britain. The largest islands by constituent country are Lewis and Harris in Scotland at , Wales' Anglesey at , the Isle of Wight in England at , and Rathlin Island in Northern Ireland at roughly ;\nClimate.\nThe climate of the UK is generally temperate, although significant local variation occurs, particularly as a result of altitude and distance from the coast. In general the south of the country is warmer than the north, and the west wetter than the east. Due to the warming influence of the Gulf Stream, the UK is significantly warmer than some other locations at a similar latitude, such as Newfoundland.\nThe prevailing winds are southwesterly, from the North Atlantic Current. More than 50% of the days are overcast. There are few natural hazards, although there can be strong winds and floods, especially in winter.\nAverage annual rainfall varies from over in the Scottish Highlands down to in Cambridge. The county of Essex is one of the driest in the UK, with an average annual rainfall of around , although it typically rains on over 100 days per year. In some years rainfall in Essex can be below , less than the average annual rainfall in Jerusalem and Beirut.\nThe highest temperature recorded in the UK was at Coningsby in Lincolnshire, on 20 July 2022. The lowest was recorded at Braemar in the Grampian Mountains, Scotland, on 11 February 1895 and 10 January 1982 and Altnaharra, also in Scotland, on 30 December 1995.\nHuman geography.\nPolitical geography.\nGovernment.\nThe United Kingdom as a whole is governed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The Parliament of the United Kingdom, based at the Palace of Westminster in London, only legislates for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on reserved matters, such as national security, broadcasting and currency, as Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have devolved governments and legislatures \u2013 the Scottish Parliament, Senedd (Welsh Parliament) and Northern Ireland Assembly respectively. The devolved governments and legislatures can make laws in a number of areas, such as culture, education\nThe Scottish Parliament has been described as \"one of the most powerful devolved parliaments in the world\", and can legislate for Scotland in areas in which the Northern Ireland Assembly or Welsh Parliament cannot for their respective countries, such as in areas as the distribution of money from dormant bank accounts, policing, criminal investigations and private security, anti-social behaviour and public order, air gun licensing, consumer advocacy and advice, Pubs Code Regulations, Sunday trading, heating and cooling, policing of railways and railway property, public sector compensation, the Crown Estate, registration of births, deaths and places of worship, Registration of land, agricultural charges and debentures, bank holidays and marriage, family relationships, matters concerning children.\nBy contrast, England has no devolved system of government, that is, the Parliament of the United Kingdom makes laws for England, as well as for reserved matters in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. England is governed by UK government ministers and legislated for by the UK parliament. The London region has a devolved assembly but proposals for elected Regional Assemblies in England were rejected in the first referendum covering North East England. (\"See Government of England.\")\nThe UK (specifically, Northern Ireland) has an international land boundary with the Republic of Ireland of 499\u00a0km. There is also a boundary between the jurisdiction of France and the UK on the Channel Tunnel.\nLocal government.\nEach part of the UK is subdivided into further local governmental regions:\nHistorically the UK was divided into counties or shires: administrative areas through which all civil responsibilities of the government were passed. Each county or shire had a county town as its administrative centre and was divided into individual parishes that were defined along ecclesiastic boundaries.\nBetween 1889 (1890 in Scotland) and 1974, the political boundaries were based on the traditional counties, but due to changes in population centres, the traditional counties became impractical as local government areas in certain highly urbanised areas. The Local Government Act 1972 created a new system of administrative counties, designed to take account of the widely differing populations across different parts of the country.\nIn the 1990s further population growth led to more political changes on a local level. Unitary authorities were formed across the entirety of Scotland and Wales, and in larger cities in England. Many unpopular administrative counties were also abolished at this time, leading to a mixture of two-tier and single-purpose authorities. Further reorganisations are planned if and when regional assemblies in England are revisited in the future.\nEconomic geography.\nThe economic geography of the UK reflects not only its current position in the global economy, but its long history both as a trading nation and an imperial power.\nThe UK led the Industrial Revolution and its highly urban character is a legacy of this, with all its major cities being current or former centres of various forms of manufacturing. However, this in turn was built on its exploitation of natural resources, especially coal and iron ore.\nPrimary industry.\nThe UK's primary industry was once dominated by the coal industry, heavily concentrated in the north, the Midlands and south Wales. This is all but gone and the major primary industry is North Sea oil. Its activity is concentrated on the UK Continental Shelf to the north-east of Scotland.\nManufacturing.\nThe UK's heavy manufacturing drove the industrial revolution. A map of the major UK cities gives a good picture of where this activity occurred, in particular Belfast, Birmingham, Glasgow, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Newcastle and Sheffield. Today there is no heavy manufacturing industry in which UK-based firms can be considered world leaders. However, areas of the UK still have a notable manufacturing base, including the Midlands which remains a strong manufacturing centre, and the North West which accounts for 60% of the United Kingdom's manufacturing output. More recently, high technology firms have concentrated largely along the M4 motorway, partly because of access to Heathrow Airport, but also because of agglomeration economies.\nFinance and services.\nOnce, every large city had a stock exchange. Now, the UK financial industry is concentrated overwhelmingly in the City of London and Canary Wharf, with back office and administrative operations often dispersed around the south of England. London is one of the world's great financial centres and is usually referred to as a world city. There is also a significant legal and ebusiness industry in Leeds.\nRegional disparity.\nThe effect of changing economic fortune has contributed to the creation of the so-called North-South divide, in which decaying industrial and ex-industrial areas of Northern England, Scotland and Wales contrast with the wealthy, finance and technology-led southern economy. This has led successive governments to develop regional policy to try to rectify the imbalance. However, this is not to say that the north\u2013south divide is uniform; some of the worst pockets of deprivation can be found in London, whilst parts of Cheshire and North Yorkshire are very wealthy. Nor is the North-South divide limited to the economic sphere; cultural and political divisions weigh heavily too.\nNatural resources.\nAgriculture.\nAgriculture in the UK is intensive, highly mechanized, and efficient by European standards. It produces approximately 60% of the nation's food needs while employing about 1.4% of the labor force. In 2023, the agricultural sector contributed \u00a313.7 billion to the UK economy, with England accounting for 73% of this output. The sector's workforce totaled 462,100 individuals, distributed as follows: 63% in England, 14% in Scotland, and 11% each in Northern Ireland and Wales.\nThe distribution of agricultural production value in 2023 was as follows:\nEnergy resources.\nThe UK possesses a variety of geological resources, including coal, petroleum, natural gas, limestone, chalk, gypsum, silica, rock salt, china clay, iron ore, tin, silver, gold, and lead. Historically, these resources have underpinned the nation's industrial development. However, the contribution of primary energy production to the UK's GDP has seen a decline over the decades. In 2023, the energy to GDP ratio was 73 metric tons of oil equivalent per million British pounds, reflecting a decrease in energy production's share of the economy.\nRenewable energy potential.\nGiven its extensive coastline, the UK has significant potential for generating electricity from wave and tidal energy. Studies estimate that tidal stream energy could provide up to 11% of the UK's electricity demand, representing an installed capacity of 11.5 GW and contributing up to \u00a317 billion to the economy by 2050. Additionally, the UK's wave energy potential is substantial, with an average wave energy density of 32.5 kilowatts per meter along its 12,429 km coastline. The theoretical annual wave energy potential is estimated at 3,538 terawatt-hours, which is approximately 11 times the nation's current electricity consumption.\nDespite this potential, as of 2022, marine energy (including wave and tidal) contributed only 11 gigawatt-hours to the UK's electricity generation. This indicates that while the resources are abundant, their commercial exploitation remains limited.\nEfforts are ongoing to harness these renewable energy sources. For instance, the Severn Estuary Commission has recommended the development of tidal energy lagoons to boost economic growth and provide renewable energy, emphasizing the need for government support to initiate such projects.\nEnvironment.\nCurrent issues.\nEngland is one of the most densely populated countries/regions in the world, and the most densely populated major nation in Europe. The high population density (especially in the southeast of England) coupled with a changing climate, is likely to put extreme pressure on the United Kingdom's water resources in the future.\nThe United Kingdom is reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It has met Kyoto Protocol target of a 12.5% reduction from 1999 levels and intends to meet the legally binding target of a 20% cut in emissions by 2010. By 2015, to recycle or compost at least 33% of household waste. Between 1998-99 and 1999\u20132000, household recycling increased from 8.8% to 10.3% respectively.\nAccording to a 2018 survey for the World Wide Fund for Nature, the United Kingdom is one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world, coming in 189th place out of 218 countries.\nInternational agreements.\nThe United Kingdom is a party to many international agreements, including:\nAir Pollution, Air Pollution-Nitrogen Oxides, Air Pollution-Sulphur 94, Air Pollution-Volatile Organic Compounds, Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic-Marine Living Resources, Antarctic Seals, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Marine Life Conservation, Nuclear Test Ban, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands and Whaling.\nThe UK has signed, but not ratified, the international agreement on Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the 21st most populated country in the world and has a population density of , with England having significantly greater density than Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Almost a third of the population lives in south east England, which is predominantly urban and suburban, with 9,089,736 people in the capital city, London, whose population density was in 2024.\nThe population of the UK has undergone demographic transition\u2014 from a typically pre-industrial population, with high birth and mortality rates and slow population growth, through a stage of falling mortality and faster rates of population growth, to a stage of low birth and mortality rates with, again, lower rates of growth. This growth through 'natural change' has been accompanied in the past three decades by growth through net immigration into the United Kingdom, which since 1999 has exceeded natural change.\nThe United Kingdom's high literacy rate of 99% at age 15 and above, is attributable to universal state education, introduced at the primary level in 1870 (Scotland 1872, free 1890) and at the secondary level in 1900. Parents are obliged to have their children educated from the ages of 5 to 16 years. In England, 16\u201317-year olds should remain in education, employment or training in the form of A-Levels, vocational training, and apprenticeships, until the age of 18.\nThe United Kingdom's population is predominantly White British (75.98% at the 2021 Census), but due to migration mostly from Commonwealth nations, Britain has become ethnically diverse. The second and third largest non-white racial groups are Asian British at 8.6% of the population, followed by Black British people at 3.71%.\nThe main language of the United Kingdom is British English. Scots is widely spoken in many parts of Scotland, as is Scottish Gaelic, a Celtic language. Cornish and Irish have been revived to a limited degree in Cornwall and Northern Ireland, but the predominant language in all these areas is English. Welsh is widely spoken as a first language in parts of North and West Wales, and to lesser extent in South East Wales, where English is the dominant first language.\nHistory.\nBefore the census, 200\u20131800.\nRoman Britain had an estimated population between 2.8\u00a0million and 3 million at the end of the second century AD. At the end of the fourth century, it had an estimated population of 3.6\u00a0million, of whom 125,000 consisted of the Roman army and their families and dependents. The urban population of Roman Britain was about 240,000 people at the end of the fourth century. Roman Britain's capital city, Londinium, is estimated to have had a population of about 60,000.\nFollowing the Roman withdrawal from Britain, Germanic tribes from continental Europe such as the Angles, Saxons and Jutes began a period of significant migration to the southeastern part of the island, notably bringing their language, Old English. Nevertheless, the overall population is believed to have fallen precipitously due to political upheavals and plagues. By the time of the compilation of the Domesday Book in the eleventh century, there may have between 1.25 and 2 million people living in England. Though the Domesday Book did not count the English population, it has been regarded as one of the first attempts to produce a census of the country.\nBetween the years of 1086 and 1750, the English population fluctuated in size due to civil war, famines and plagues. By the end of the 13th century, the population was estimated to have reached between four and six million people. A combination of factors such as widespread famine and disease in the following century collapsed the population dramatically. An agricultural crisis in 1315 to 1322 and the Black Death in 1348 to 1350 collapsed the population by over a third of its pre-existing number, and the growth rate. In 1377, the population was estimated via a poll-tax of all people aged 14 and over, depending on the population amount of those under 14, to be around 2.2\u00a0million to 3.1\u00a0million.\nPeriods of instability over the 15th century, such as the Wars of the Roses, caused the population to increase at a slower pace. The general factors behind this were a high mortality rate due to war, fewer marriages within the population, late marriages (keeping fertility levels low) and a net emigration of English people out of the country. By the 16th century, the situation had changed due to political stability under the Tudor monarchy and little civil unrest, which would have resulted in a higher mortality rate. While this was overturned with the English Civil War in 17th century, it allowed the population to grow at a faster pace, causing the population of England to reach a pre-collapse total of 5.74\u00a0million by 1750. \nIn Scotland, population growth was not to the same extent as it was in England, which resulted in being significantly lower in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, which is often ascribed to similar factors halting it such as a high mortality rate, especially for infants, and later marriage and childbearing patterns. Ireland before the 19th century consistently had rapid population growth, which has been ascribed to higher fertility rates and earlier age of marriage than in England. The Plantation of Ulster in the 17th century also affected the population of Scotland, with an estimated 100,000 Scots migrating to Ulster. The Jacobite rebellion in 1745 also caused significant emigration. The estimated population total of Scotland in 1691 was 1.23\u00a0million.\nThe impetus to collect population data was reinforced due to food supply concerns and war against France in the late 18th century and the beginning of the early 19th century. In 1800, the Census Act was passed, authorising the first modern census in British history to be conducted.\nCensus established and the demographic transition, 1800\u20132000.\nThe first Census in 1801 revealed that the population of Great Britain was 10.5\u00a0million. England's population was 8.3\u00a0million, Wales' population was 0.6\u00a0million, and Scotland had a population of 1.6\u00a0million. In Ireland, the population was between 4.5 and 5.5\u00a0million inhabitants. Since 1801, a census has been conducted almost every decade. In Ireland, it was conducted for the first time in 1821.\nDuring the Industrial Revolution, the demographic transition started in the United Kingdom, going from a pre-industrial society demographically to an industrialised society. At the 1841 Census, the population of England and Wales was 15.9\u00a0million, having doubled in the space of 40 years. Ireland had 8.2\u00a0million and Scotland had 2.6\u00a0million. The slightly lower rate of growth for Scotland may be attributed to higher net emigration of Scottish people out of the nation, and two typhus epidemics in 1837 and 1847.\nFactors often associated with the beginning of the demographic transition began to change dramatically as well, which contributed to the rapid increase. For example, child mortality decreased dramatically: the proportion of children born in London who died before the age of five decreased from 74.5% in 1730\u20131749, to 31.8% in 1810\u20131829. General mortality was thought to have declined as well, especially after 1850. This, as well as an increased birth rate, caused the English population to sustain itself in the second phase of the transition from 1750 to 1870.\nIn the second half of the 19th century the population of England continued to grow quickly, from 16.8\u00a0million in 1851 to 30.5\u00a0million in 1901. This rapid growth was seen in the other constituent nations. In Wales, the population increased from 0.6\u00a0million in 1801, to 2 million in 1901. In Scotland, the population increased from 1.6\u00a0million in 1801, to 4.5\u00a0million in 1901. In contrast, the Great Irish Famine, which began in the 1840s, caused the deaths of 1 million Irish people, and caused well over a million to emigrate. \nMass emigration became entrenched as a result of the famine, and Ireland's population decreased rapidly, from 8.2\u00a0million in 1841 to 3.2\u00a0million in 1901. This massive population collapse did not affect Northern Ireland to the same extent, as it was more industrialised and urbanised. While the Northern Ireland population declined, it recovered by the beginning of the 20th century. This prolonged period of emigration and net population decline in Irish history was not reversed until the middle of the 20th century.\nThe total fertility rate of the UK population declined from 4.88 children per woman in 1871, to 2.4 by 1921, representing a transition to the third stage of the demographic transition. Traditional means of birth control, such as abstinence and withdrawal, facilitated the collapse of the birth rate. By the 1930s, this was hastened by more modern methods of contraception, which were beginning to gain increased acceptance. From 1840 to 1930 there was a net emigration of English people out of the country, which scaled back population growth.\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, the United Kingdom began to approach the fourth stage of the demographic transition. The deaths of troops in the First World War, coupled with the 1918 influenza outbreak, are estimated to have totalled over 900,000 deaths in the United Kingdom. This reduced the male population of the Lost Generation and altered the sex ratio, which slowed the growth rate of the population. By the end of the Second World War, the fourth stage transition was completed. There was a low but fluctuating birth rate, a low death rate and a slower population growth rate. The British Nationality Act 1948 allowed many people from the British Empire's colonies to migrate to the country, being classed in nationality as the same as a native of the United Kingdom. This law, while an unintentional side-effect, led to the start of modern immigration to the United Kingdom.\nIn the 1960s, there was also major social change in the United Kingdom. Liberalisation of society led to the Abortion Act 1967, which legalised abortion in the United Kingdom for the first time, and the Divorce Reform Act 1969, which made divorce easier. Between these years, the population fluctuated: from the 1950s onwards the population increased through natural growth. By the mid-1970s, the population decreased due to emigration, which took net migration to a negative, and deaths exceeded births. For the first time in 1973, the birth rate of the country fell below replacement level. By the 1980s, the decline of population growth had recovered to an extent due to a reversal of net emigration.\nIn the 1990s, international migration began to contribute more to population growth. In 1998, this overtook natural increase as the main cause of growth. Liberalisation of immigration rules under the Blair government allowed a rapid increase of the number of migrants arriving, quadrupling the number from a net migration rate of 50,000 a year, to 200,000 a year.\nModern century, 2000\u2013present.\nBy the beginning of the 21st century, the population of the United Kingdom was 59,113,000 people. In each constituent nation, the population of England was 49,449,700, Scotland had a population of 5,064,200, Wales had a population of 2,910,200 and Northern Ireland a population of 1,689,300. Increased international migration, which began to rapidly increase at the end of the 20th century brought increased ethnic heterogenization to the British population, in ethnicity and race, and country of birth. \nIn 2001, the White British population was registered to be 88.52% of the total population. In 2011, this proportion of the population had dropped to 81.88%. Other ethnic groups rose by 50% of their respective total population in 2001, or doubled entirely.\nSuch rapid immigration growth boosted population growth in the United Kingdom. In 2011, the population was around 63 million people.\nPopulation.\nThe population of the UK in the last recorded census in 2011 was 63 million, of whom 31\u00a0million were male and 32\u00a0million female. The 2011 census recorded the population of England as 53.0\u00a0million, Scotland as 5.3\u00a0million, Wales as 3.1\u00a0million, and Northern Ireland as 1.8\u00a0million. At the last recorded population estimate, it was estimated that the UK population was at a total of 67,081,234 people.\nThere are 13 urban areas that exceed 500,000 inhabitants: they are centred on London, Birmingham, Glasgow, Leeds and Bradford, Southampton and Portsmouth, Sheffield, Liverpool, Leicester, Manchester, Belfast, Bristol, Newcastle-upon-Tyne and Nottingham.\nPopulation change over time.\nThe following table shows the total UK population estimated at census dates. Pre 1901 figures include the whole of Ireland, whereas from 1901 onwards only the population of Northern Ireland is included.\nPopulation density calculated on:\nFuture projections.\nThe UK government first began publishing population projections for the country in the 1920s under the Government Actuary's Department (GAD) which were mainly produced to be used for long-term financial estimates for pensions and other schemes of social insurance. However, since the Second World War, population projections have taken an expanded role in all areas of influencing government policy. The GAD produced population projections every year from 1955 to 1979 and then switched it to every 2 years up to 1991. The Office for National Statistics took control of producing population projections for the country in 2006.\nThe British Office for National Statistics' 2016-based National Population Projections indicated that, if recent trends continue, the UK's population would increase by 3.6\u00a0million between mid-2016 and mid-2026. This represents an average annual growth rate of 0.5%. Over the same period, the population of England is projected to grow by 5.9%; for Wales, this figure is 3.1%, while for Scotland and Northern Ireland the figures are 3.2% and 4.2% respectively. These projections did not allow for any possible effects of the UK leaving the European Union.\nFertility.\nSince 1838 it has been compulsory to register a birth or death in the United Kingdom.\nOfficial data on the fertility rate of the country was first made available in 1938, However, it is possible to estimate the total fertility rate (TFR) from 1541 onwards.\nThe fertility rate of the United Kingdom before the 19th century remained at around 5 children per woman. This rate has been falling since 1870, when the country began into transition into the third stage of the demographic transition. This transition represents the change in reproductive strategy from how many children a mother 'needs' to how many she 'wants', and a substitution of quality over quantity in the offspring produced. From the 1880s onwards, the birth rate began to decline rapidly from its previous levels. In England the rate declined by 44% between 1875 and 1920.\nThe decline has been attributed to a number of factors, including biological, technological, societal socio-economic reasons and cultural trends. The Industrial Revolution led to large scale movements of people to high density urban population centres; income per capita rose significantly especially in the last half of the 19th century, while economic growth improved the livelihoods of the working and middle classes. This growth in the standard of living led also reduced mortality rates (which had been in decline since the early 18th century) and especially in infant mortality. The decline of child labour at the same time meant there was less economic need for a large number of children. Educational standards improved during the same time period, which gave children more economical potential.\nThe increasing number of women in the workforce in the 19th century also contributed to the birth rate decline.\nImprovements in nutrition, which are linked to biological factors such as a decline in lactation, have also been cited as a potential factor in the decline of the fertility rate. Technological developments also began to have an effect; contraceptives became more usable in the latter half of the 19th century due to developments in the production of rubber. Abortion, while illegal, was also used, though the extent is unknown.\nA decline in religious adherence during the 19th century (despite a shortage of data) has also been considered as a reason. While there is debate among demographers as to the relative importance of these factors, it is generally accepted that the combined effect was that mothers could begin to invest more time and nurture 'quality' into their offspring rather than having an increased 'quantity' of children, and that this led to the decrease of the total fertility rate.\nBy 1914, the birthrate was around 2.88 children per woman, but by 1918 this had collapsed by almost 50% due to World War One and sank to 2.03 children. In the post-World War One period, while the birthrate initially boomed reaching a peak of 3.08 children in 1920, this was followed by a rapid decline and had slumped to historic lows by the 1930s, for the first time in the country's history falling below a replacement level fertility rate. The rate did not recover until the end of the Second World War in 1945.\nIn the post-World War Two period, the fertility rate of the country boomed once again, reaching levels not seen since the late 19th century. This peaked in 1964, with a TFR of 2.95. However, by 1973, the fertility rate of the country again dropped below replacement levels, and has continued to decline until the present day.\nIt is said that the sub-replacement level fertility rate is not viewed by the government as a major issue. Little incentive has been provided to increase the birth rate throughout the UK's post war period. Compared to other countries in Western European, the United Kingdom's rate remains relatively high.\nFamily planning policies were enacted during the 1970s as a result of the rapid population growth during the 1960s. The 1973 NHS Reorganisation Act is one example: this Act made family planning advice and supplies available to the public. With previous liberalising acts such as the Abortion Act and the Divorce Reform Act, and scientific developments such as increased access to contraceptive methods such as the contraceptive pill, it is generally accepted that these social changes contributed to the decline of the fertility rate below replacement level in the latter half of the 20th century. With these changes also, pre-marital conceptions fell to 1950 levels by the late 1970s. This decline in the birth rate follows a similar pattern to other European countries.\nThe government's position was explained in 1984 at the UN Conference on Population in Mexico;The United Kingdom government does not pursue a population policy in the sense of actively trying to influence the overall size of the population, its age structure, or the components of change except in the field of immigration. Nor has it expressed a view about the size of population, or the age structure, that would be desirable... The current level of births has not been the cause of general anxiety. The prevailing view is that decisions about fertility and childbearing are for people themselves to make, but that it is proper for government to provide individuals with the information and the means necessary to make their decisions effective. To this end, the government provides assistance with family planning as part of the National Health Service. The ageing of the population does raise social and economic issues. However, it is believed that these will prove manageable; and also, to a degree, that society will adapt...\u2019 In 2003, Right to Request was setup which allowed the parents of small children to request flexible working times which included shorter working hours for parents to care for their children. However, a report in 2006 found that its impact was negligible as mothers tended to switch employers to get reduced hours regardless.\nMigration in the late 1990s and 2000s led to the overall total fertility rate of the country rising by 0.1% between 2004 and 2011.\nIn 2012, the UK's total fertility rate (TFR) was 1.92 children per woman, below the replacement rate, which in the UK is 2.075. In 2001, the TFR was at a record low of 1.63, but it then increased every year until it reached a peak of 1.96 in 2008, before decreasing again. In 2012 and 2013, England and Wales's TFR decreased to 1.85. In Scotland however TFR was lower: it decreased from 1.75 in 2010 to 1.67 in 2012. Northern Ireland has the highest TFR in the UK, standing at 2.02 in 2010 and 2.03 in 2012.\nMother's mean age at first birth.\nThe first available data on when a mother gives birth for the first time was in 1920.\nThe reduction of the total fertility rate of the United Kingdom has also had an effect on the mean age in which a mother gives birth to her first child.\nThe age in which a mother gives birth to her first child has changed depending on the time period, but since the 1970s the age in which someone gives birth has been trending upwards.\nFamily size.\nThe reduction of the fertility rate has also had an effect on the general family size of mothers in the United Kingdom, with the two being interlinked with each other. The family size of the average UK family can be estimated for a \"completed family size\" (CFS), which is an estimate of the amount of children a woman has birthed by the end of her childbearing years.\nFamily size within the UK has shifted towards two or one children in recent decades, rather than in the past when larger family sizes were more prominent and sought after. This pattern is similar to other European countries, where couples are having fewer children. Increasingly, there are also more couples who are completely childless; this has been increasing since the 1950s.\nLife expectancy.\nLife expectancy has increased in the United Kingdom since the 18th century due to precipitate declines in child mortality, see below, and from relatively minor improvements in healthcare. A life expectancy of 40, the historical norm, does not mean that person is likely to die at 40 years old but rather when he or she is very old or very young; much in line with a bathtub curve.\nAt the start of the 20th century, the life expectancy at birth was only 45.6 years.\nBy 1950, life expectancy at birth had risen to 68.6 years. During the latter half of the century, further factors influenced the increase of life expectancy: diseases and the improvement of healthcare in the 1950s, decline in smoking in the mid-1970s and improvements in treating heart disease in the 1990s contributed to its decline.\nAt the start of the 21st century, the life expectancy at birth was 77.8 years.\nIn 2011 the life expectancy at birth of the UK was around 80.4 years, but the rate of increase has been stalling. Potential factors behind this may be austerity measures imposed in the beginning of the 2010s, which coincidentally since then mortality rates have slowed down in decline or older people dying off at faster rates than expected. On the topic of austerity measures, Professor Richard Faragher has said that \"It is possible to have high or rising life expectancy during austerity, as is the case in Japan. Similarly, you can have rising life expectancy despite high levels of inequality \u2013 this was the case in Britain from 1900\u20131950.\" but noted that austerity measures to social services like the NHS, especially social care support for the elderly may be causing a stalling of life expectancy increase due to a decreased quality of life for older generations.\nInfant mortality.\nInfant mortality has been on the decline since the Second Industrial Revolution, although the majority of the decline came around from the start to the end of the 20th century. In raw terms for example, infant mortality in England sat around 151 deaths to 1000 live births in 1901 but by the end of the century it had plummeted down to only 6 deaths per 1000 births.\nThere are two general lines of thought which are usually taken from into analysing the decline of infant mortality rates, the first line of thought comes from social historians, who ascribe the decline of infant mortality to social phenomenons of the time such as the need for a healthy population for the sake of the nation's fighting capabilities and political issues surrounding women. The second line of thought comes from demographers themselves which more or less ascribe the decline of infant mortality itself more to the general decline of mortality altogether in the society than any particular reason why.\nPhysical unfitness during the Boer War came into national prominence as many recruits came back to be too medically unfit for service. With this, In 1904, the \"Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Physical Deterioration\" was published which listed large amounts of details of the failings of the British population, and for that matter government, in sustaining a healthy population.\nThe current rate of infant mortality in the United Kingdom is roughly around 3.82 deaths per 1,000 live births.\nAge structure.\nInterlinked with fertility and mortality, The age structure of the United Kingdom has varied with how rates of fertility and mortality have changed throughout the country's history. Due to the transition to an industrialised society, the United Kingdom has also undergone a 'demographic transition': that is to say, that it has gone from a high birth rate, high mortality rate society to a low birth rate, low mortality rate society over the space of two centuries.\nBefore the 18th century, the United Kingdom retained an age structure universal to societies in the first stage of the transition theory, with high fertility rates and high mortality rates, in the late 18th century, the Industrial Revolution began, kickstarting the country's transition into the second phase: mortality rates declined but birth rates stayed at the same level; by 1870, the country had begun to transition into the third phase: the birth rate began to decline from around near 5 children per woman to below replacement level in the 1930s. The fourth phase of the transition began in the 1960s, when the fertility rate rose, and peaked during the middle of the decade, and then collapsed by 1973 to a below replacement level rate. Since then, the rate has not risen to an above replacement level fertility rate; this has resulted in a population which is currently ageing: in 2007, for the first time in the country's history, there were more people over the age of 60 than there were under the age of 16.\nPeaks and bands within the population represent different periods in which people were born, for example, a large peak of people in particularly for those aged 70\u201374 born following the Second World War and a wide band for those aged 50\u201359, born during the 1960s baby boom. Those aged 80 upwards would have been born in the 1930s baby dearth when the birth rate was below replacement level. On the younger band of the population there is a noticeable gap between the ages of 14 and 20, this due to at the beginning of the 21st century a lower number of children being born (and a subsequent lower TFR), however in the years following the birth rate rose during the 2010s and a 'broadening' of the pyramid began for those in the younger years leading to more children in those age cohorts. In relation to the sex ratio of the country, in the higher ages of the population, there are more women than men reflecting the higher life expectancies of women in the population, in the lower ages there are more men than women because there are slightly more boys than girls born each year. In relation to the older age brackets, In 2015, there were estimated to be over half a million people (556,270) aged 90 and over living in the UK, up from 194,670 people in 1985, and there were estimated to be 14,570 centenarians (people aged 100 or over) and 850 people aged 105 or over. The Office for National Statistics has also wrote in their mid-2016 report on population projections that the median age of the British population was 40 years of age, and this will continue to rise as more people in the population age and a below-replacement level fertility level not refilling the population. This will make the number of people aged 85 and over double from 1.6\u00a0million in mid-2016 to 3.2\u00a0million in mid-2041.\nThe demographic ageing of the population is not evenly spread geographically, as people in rural areas are typically of a higher age than those living in metropolitan areas such as Greater London for example.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nUrbanisation and population density.\nPopulation density.\nThe United Kingdom is one of the most densely populated countries in Europe; in 2020 it was the 8th most densely populated country.\nThe current largest urban areas are listed below:\nUrbanisation.\nRapid urbanisation began with the onset of the Industrial Revolution in the mid to late 18th century, shifting jobs and more importantly people away from rural Britain's dominance at the time which was primarily agricultural, to manufacturing jobs within urban areas which started to spring up. In 1750, an estimated total of around only 1 million people lived in some sort of urban area such as a town or city, which was around 1/6th of the estimated total population but a century later this had risen to 8 million people in 1850, equating to just over half of the nation.\nWhile this mass urbanisation affected pre-existing cities to a large degree such as London, smaller and 'newer' towns were in particular effected by the re-distribution of the population and exploded in raw population growth. Cities such as Birmingham, Bristol, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield and Newcastle for example had an explosive expansion in population numbers around the middle of the 19th century due to the industrial expansion of said cities bringing jobs and again people in for work. London during the 19th century become noted as the 'premier city' of the world, being the most populated city from 1825 to 1900 and being the first city in Europe and one of the first in the world to reach the figure of one million inhabitants, and then 5 million inhabitants. This urbanisation in the 19th century has had two phases. This mass influx of the population into the cities resulted in a centralisation of the population into the inner city areas however by the time of the late 19th century and early 20th century when technological advancements in transport kicked off allowing cities to expand their 'peripherals' from the inner areas to create large scale 'city regions' of their own. London in particular during the 19th century had the majority of its population within the city living in the inner centre, however by the 20th century a massive expansion of 'Outer London' began which slowly became larger in population size by the middle of the century than Inner London.\nBy the end of the 20th century the figure of urbanisation was 80% of the country. Importance in population size however of the capital declined during the latter half of the 20th century. By the end of the 20th century, London's ranking on the most populated cities of the world had fallen down to not even being in the top 20.\nThe current classification of an 'urban' area, also termed as a 'built-up area' (BUA) in the 2011 census, is a settlement which takes variables from both numerical population numbers and population density; in population numbers this is roughly more than or 10,000 people living in an area. Anything below that is classified as 'rural', having several levels of distinction to define a rural town and fringe, village or hamlet which is usually taken from population density figures. These areas are then defined within 'output areas' (OA's) themselves, which are geographic areas of the United Kingdom. The population which resides within classified 'urban' areas was 84.4% of total population in 2022 and the annual rate of urbanisation change is estimated to be around 0.8% between 2020 and 2025.\nVital statistics.\nStatistics since 1838.\nSources:\nNotable events in British demographics:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Sort under/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nIn 2023, 208,877 (31.8%) of all live births were to non-UK-born mothers in England and Wales. 37.3% of live births were to parents where either one or both were born outside the UK.\nStructure of the population.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Population by Sex and Age Group (Census 27.III.2011): \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Population Estimates by Sex and Age Group (30.VI.2020) (Excluding Channel Islands (Guernsey and Jersey) and Isle of Man, shown separately, if available. Data refer to usual resident population.): \nBirths in England and Wales by place of birth of parents.\nParents\u2019 country of birth:\nSocial issues.\nMarriage, divorce, families and household types.\nMarriage and divorce.\nIn 2004, 58% of births were conceived within a married couple, 35% by non-married couples registered by both parents and 7% by non-married mothers who registered the birth alone.\nThis varied from each constituent nation, Wales for example had the highest births outside of marriage at 51% in 2004, In England this percentage was 42% and in Scotland 47%. Northern Ireland had the lowest of 35% in 2004.\nSexual orientation.\nOut of the 600,000 people in the UK that applied to go to university through UCAS in 2020, 7.2%, or 40,000, described themselves as LGBT on their application form. UCAS estimates this to be a rate 2.5 times higher than the overall UK population. The UCAS report in collaboration with Stonewall also found LGBT students were more likely to come from disadvantaged backgrounds (compared to those who identified as heterosexual or didn't specify), have a disability (compared to non-LGBT students) and have a mental health condition (compared to non-LGBT students).\nFor the first time, the 2021 United Kingdom census included a question on sexual orientation. Results for Scotland are expected to be published from spring 2024 onwards.\nGender identity.\nIn the 2021 United Kingdom census, in England and Wales, 262,000 people (0.5%) answered that their gender identity was different from their sex assigned at birth, including 0.10% who identified as a trans man, 0.10% as a trans woman, and 0.06% as non-binary. 1% of people aged 16 to 24 years said that their gender identity was different from their sex assigned at birth.\nAbortion.\nAbortion in the United Kingdom (however not Northern Ireland) was officially decriminalised under the Abortion Act 1967, allowing women for the first time to get an abortion under numerous medical grounds outlined within the act. Previously, this was outlawed under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 and then the updated Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929 which only permitted an abortion if the death of a child was \"done in good faith for the purpose only of preserving the life of the mother\".\nIn 2020, the number of conceptions which led to an abortion was around 25.3%\nEmployment and income.\nThe unemployment rate for the youth age bracket of 15\u201324 was 11.2% in 2019 \u2013 13% for males and 9.2% for females.\nMigration.\nHistorical and present net numbers.\nMigration to the UK has varied through its history. Irish migration from the Great Famine predominated during the 19th century. Additionally Jewish migration from Russia also arrived famously into Bethnal Green in London.\nStarting from the 1950s onwards, following on from the British Nationality Act 1948 which de jure allowed the migration of upwards 800,000,000 British subjects who were now British citizens in law, modern mass migration to the United Kingdom began. During this decade West Indians from the Caribbean, those from Jamaica and St Vincent and the Grenadines, Dominica \nso on began to arrive.\nDuring the middle of the 1960s to the 1970s, migration flipped in origin to the majority of those arriving being of South Asian origin from the Indian sub-continent. Immigration restrictions, in response to the ever increasing number arriving, were introduced, such as the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962, Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968 and the Immigration Act 1971.\nThrough the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s, net migration to the United Kingdom was often negative in terms of numbers, with more people leaving the country, than entering in total.\nSince 1994, net migration in numbers has been in the positives, with more people entering the country, rather than leaving. Migration increased fourfold following the election of Tony Blair in 1997, immigration restrictions were undone such as the primary purpose rule.\nIn 2004, along with Ireland and Sweden, Britain was one of the only countries within the EU to not implement 'transitional controls' on migration flows from the newly joined A8 countries from Eastern Europe. Around 453,000 immigrants, which has been revised upwards in recent years, from these new counties were estimated in 2015 to have migrated to the UK.\nCountry of birth.\nCountry of birth was first asked as a census question in 1841.\nIn the 1980s to 1990s, around 12 to 13% of births were born to foreign-born mothers. In 2004, this had risen to 20% of births being born to foreign-born mothers. The fertility rate among non-UK born women was 1.98 and among UK born women 1.50 in 2020.\nInternal.\nPopulation movements of the country have fluctuated over time, in the 19th century with the urbanisation of the country, large amounts of people moved to London and nearby industrial cities, but in recent years there has been a general trend of 'de-urbanisation' as parts of the population have moved back to the countryside. An example of recent large scale internal movement in the 21st century has been the departure of 220,000 White British Londoners to other areas of rural England and Wales over the 2000s and over the 2010s around a total of 550,000 people left the city. Demographically by age, the people leaving the city more than entering tend to be in their 30s and 40s while people entering in their 20s.\nEthnicity.\nEthnic demographic breakdown.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Sticky table start/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:row hover highlight/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNote:\nGeographic distributionAge structure of ethnic groups\nEthnicity of school pupils\n&lt;gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Ethnicity of school pupils with England and its administrative districts in the school year of 2021/2022\"&gt;\nFile:White total school children within England.svg|White: 71.4%\nFile:White British school children within England.svg|White British: 63.9%\n&lt;/gallery&gt;Ethnicity of live births and total fertility rate\nFuture projections.\nVarious studies and projections have been made regarding the future ethnic composition of the United Kingdom. \nA recent report by Professor Matt Goodwin of the University of Buckingham forecasts significant demographic changes over the coming decades. According to the projections, the proportion of individuals identifying as White British is expected to decline from approximately 73% of the population to 57% by 2050, and fall below 50% by 2063, thus becoming a minority group. The report further estimates that by the end of the 21st century, the White British population may constitute around 33.7% of the total UK population. \nIt also projects a substantial increase in the share of the population comprising foreign-born individuals and second-generation immigrants\u2014from under 20% to 33.5% within the next 25 years. By 2100, it is predicted that around 60% of the UK population will either have been born outside the United Kingdom or have at least one parent who was an immigrant.\nIn 2010, academic David Coleman produced research postulating a future demographic decline of the White British in Britain, indicating that they would become a minority in Birmingham and London during the 2020s. He also estimated that around 2056 to 2066, the trend of a declining share of the white populace will result in the United Kingdom having an overall white minority.\nIn Prospect, he outlined four projections for a majority-minority scenario within the United Kingdom;\nReligion.\nIn 2001, the question of religious adherence was asked for the first time since 1851 in the United Kingdom Census.\nThe traditional religion in the United Kingdom is Christianity. In England the established church is the Church of England (Anglican). In Scotland, the Church of Scotland, a Presbyterian Church, is regarded as the 'national church', but there is not an established church.\nIn Wales there is no established church, with the Church in Wales having been disestablished in 1920. In Ireland, the Church of Ireland was disestablished in 1871. In Northern Ireland and parts of Western Scotland there are lingering sectarian divides between Roman Catholic and Protestant communities.\nThe table below shows data regarding religion for the 2001, 2011 and 2021/22 censuses:\nIn the 2011 Census, rather than select one of the specified religions offered on the Census form, many people chose to write in their own religion. Some of these religions were reassigned to one of the main religions offered. In England and Wales, 241,000 people belonged to religious groups which did not fall into any of the main religions. The largest of these were Pagans (56,620), Spiritualists (39,061) and Jains (20,288). Despite its high-profile nature, there were only 2,418 Scientologists. \nThe census recorded 176,632 people stating their religion as Jedi Knight and 6,242 people as Heavy Metal after a campaign by \"Metal Hammer\". These returns were classified as \"No religion\", along with Atheist, Agnostic, Humanist, and Free Thinker. Those who ticked Heathen, who had been categorised as \"no religion\" in 2001, were categorised as \"other\". It is unclear how the ONS treated people who ticked \"Other\" but did not write in any religion.\nIn 2012, the British Social Attitudes Survey found the highest number to be non-religious (48%) followed by Christians (46%) with another six per cent identifying otherwise. Discrepancies found between surveys may be the result of differences in phrasing, question order, and data collection method.\nFuture projections.\nThe Muslim population in the United Kingdom, currently estimated at approximately 7% of the population, is projected to increase significantly in the coming decades. According to recent demographic forecasts, the proportion of Muslims in the UK is expected to rise to 11.2% within the next 25 years and to 19.2% by the end of the 21st century.\nUnder a \u201chigh Muslim migration scenario\u201d\u2014in which the UK experiences sustained above-average levels of immigration from Muslim-majority countries\u2014the proportion of Muslims in the population could reach 25% by 2100. In this scenario, it is further projected that nearly one in three individuals under the age of 40 could identify as Muslim by the end of the century.\nIn 2017, Pew Research Center found that by 2050, in all scenarios, the Muslim population of the United Kingdom will rise. Depending on the scenario, the percentage of the population in 2050 which will be Muslim will either be 9.7% in a zero migration scenario, 16.7% in a medium migration scenario or 17.2% in a high migration scenario.\nLanguages.\nThe United Kingdom's de facto official language is English, which is spoken as a first language by 95% of the population. Six regional languages\u2014Scots, Ulster-Scots, Welsh, Cornish, Irish and Scottish Gaelic\u2014are protected under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Abilities in these languages, other than Cornish, for those aged three and above were recorded in the 2011 census as follows.\nRegional languages.\nCornish is spoken by around 2,500 people. In the 2011 census, 464 respondents aged three and over in Cornwall said that Cornish was their main language, amounting to 0.09% of the population of Cornwall aged three and over.\nAfter English, Polish was the second most common language given in the United Kingdom census 2011. 618,091 respondents aged three and over said that Polish was their main language, amounting to 1.01% of the population of the United Kingdom aged three and over.\nThe French language is spoken in some parts of the Channel Islands although the islands, like the Isle of Man, are not part of the United Kingdom.\nBritish Sign Language is also common.\nNational identity.\nRespondents to the 2011 UK census gave their national identities as follows.\nEducation.\nIn the present day each country of the United Kingdom has a separate education system, with power over education matters in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland being devolved.\nUniversal state education in England and Wales was introduced for primary level in 1870 and secondary level in 1900. Education is mandatory from the ages of 5 to 18. The majority of children are educated in state-sector schools, only a small proportion of which select on the grounds of academic ability. Despite a fall in actual numbers, the proportion of children in England attending private schools rose slightly from 7.1% to 7.3% between 2004 and 2007.\nScotland first legislated for universal provision of education in 1696. Four per cent of children in Scotland attend private schools, a rate which has remained relatively stable since 2015.\nIn Wales, one of the most notable distinctive features of education in Wales is the emphasis on the Welsh language \u2013 lessons in which are compulsory for all until the age of 16. A significant minority of students (15.7% in the 2014\\15 academic year) were taught primarily through the medium of Welsh.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
