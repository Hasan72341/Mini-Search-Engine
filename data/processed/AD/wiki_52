The originally French title refers to the Duchy of Brabant; the name is usually untranslated in Belgium's other two official languages, Dutch and German.\nHistory.\nAccording to legend, the Belgian national anthem was written in September 1830, during the Belgian Revolution, by a young revolutionary called \"Jenneval\", who read the lyrics during a meeting at the Aigle d'Or caf\u00e9.\nJenneval, a Frenchman whose real name was Alexandre Dechet (sometimes known as Louis-Alexandre Dechet), wrote the Braban\u00e7onne. At the time, he was an actor at the theatre where, in August 1830, the revolution started, which led to independence from the Netherlands. Jenneval died in the war of independence. Fran\u00e7ois van Campenhout composed the accompanying score, based on the tune of a French song called \"L'Air des lanciers polonais\" (\"the tune of the Polish Lancers\"), written by the French poet Eug\u00e8ne de Pradel, whose tune was itself an adaptation of the tune of a song, \"L'Air du magistrat irr\u00e9prochable\", found in a popular collection of drinking songs called \"La Cl\u00e9 du caveau\" (The Key to the cellar) and it was first performed in September 1830.\nIn 1860, Belgium formally adopted the song and music as its national anthem, although the then prime minister, Charles Rogier, edited out lyrics attacking the Dutch House of Orange, inspired by the version written by Louis Hymans.\nThe Braban\u00e7onne is also a monument (1930) by the sculptor Charles Samuel on the Surlet de Chokier square in Brussels. The monument contains partial lyrics of both the French and Dutch versions of the anthem. Like many elements in Belgian folklore, this is mainly based on the French \"La Marseillaise\" which is also both an anthem and the name of a monument \u2013 the sculptural group \"Departure of the Volunteers of 1792\", commonly called \"La Marseillaise\", at the base of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.\nLyrics.\n1830 original lyrics.\nFirst version (August 1830).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nSecond version (September 1830).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nThird version (1860).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nCurrent version.\nVarious committees were charged with reviewing the text and tune of the Braban\u00e7onne and establishing an official version. A ministerial circular of the Ministry of the Interior on 8 August 1921 decreed that only the fourth verse of the text by Charles Rogier should be considered official for all three, French, German and in Dutch.\nModern short trilingual version.\nIn recent years, an unofficial short version of the anthem is sung during Belgian National Day on 21 July each year, combining the words of the anthem in all three of Belgium's official languages, similar to the bilingual version of \"O Canada\". The lyrics are from the 4th verse of the anthem.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Fermat's principle states that the path taken by a ray between two given points is the path that can be traveled in the least time.\nFirst proposed by the French mathematician Pierre de Fermat in 1662, as a means of explaining the ordinary law of refraction of light (Fig.\u202f1), Fermat's principle was initially controversial because it seemed to ascribe knowledge and intent to nature. Not until the 19th century was it understood that nature's ability to test alternative paths is merely a fundamental property of waves. If points \"A\" and \"B\" are given, a wavefront expanding from \"A\" sweeps all possible ray paths radiating from \"A\", whether they pass through \"B\" or not. If the wavefront reaches point \"B\", it sweeps not only the \"ray\" path(s) from \"A\" to \"B\", but also an infinitude of nearby paths with the same endpoints. Fermat's principle describes any ray that happens to reach point\u00a0\"B\"; there is no implication that the ray \"knew\" the quickest path or \"intended\" to take that path.\nIn its original \"strong\" form, Fermat's principle states that the path taken by a ray between two given points is the path that can be traveled in the least time. In order to be true in all cases, this statement must be weakened by replacing the \"least\" time with a time that is \"stationary\" with respect to variations of the path \u2013 so that a deviation in the path causes, at most, a \"second-order\" change in the traversal time. To put it loosely, a ray path is surrounded by close paths that can be traversed in \"very\" close times. It can be shown that this technical definition corresponds to more intuitive notions of a ray, such as a line of sight or the path of a narrow beam.\nFor the purpose of comparing traversal times, the time from one point to the next nominated point is taken as if the first point were a \"point-source\". Without this condition, the traversal time would be ambiguous; for example, if the propagation time from P to P\u2032 were reckoned from an arbitrary wavefront \"W\" containing P\u200a (Fig.\u202f2), that time could be made arbitrarily small by suitably angling the wavefront.\nTreating a point on the path as a source is the minimum requirement of Huygens' principle, and is part of the explanation of Fermat's principle. But it can also be shown that the geometric \"construction\" by which Huygens tried to apply his own principle (as distinct from the principle itself) is simply an invocation of Fermat's principle. Hence all the conclusions that Huygens drew from that construction \u2013 including, without limitation, the laws of rectilinear propagation of light, ordinary reflection, ordinary refraction, and the extraordinary refraction of \"Iceland crystal\" (calcite) \u2013 are also consequences of Fermat's principle.\nDerivation.\nSufficient conditions.\nLet us suppose that:\nThen the various propagation paths from \"A\" to \"B\" will help each other, or interfere constructively, if their traversal times agree within the said tolerance. For a small tolerance (in the limiting case), the permissible range of variations of the path is maximized if the path is such that its traversal time is \"stationary\" with respect to the variations, so that a variation of the path causes at most a \"second-order\" change in the traversal time.\nThe most obvious example of a stationarity in traversal time is a (local or global) minimum \u2013 that is, a path of \"least\" time, as in the \"strong\" form of Fermat's principle. But that condition is not essential to the argument.\nHaving established that a path of stationary traversal time is reinforced by a maximally wide corridor of neighboring paths, we still need to explain how this reinforcement corresponds to intuitive notions of a ray. But, for brevity in the explanations, let us first \"define\" a ray path as a path of stationary traversal time.\nA ray as a signal path (line of sight).\nIf the corridor of paths reinforcing a ray path from \"A\" to \"B\" is substantially obstructed, this will significantly alter the disturbance reaching \"B\" from \"A\" \u2013 unlike a similar-sized obstruction \"outside\" any such corridor, blocking paths that do not reinforce each other. The former obstruction will significantly disrupt the signal reaching \"B\" from \"A\", while the latter will not; thus the ray path marks a \"signal\" path. If the signal is visible light, the former obstruction will significantly affect the appearance of an object at \"A\" as seen by an observer at \"B\", while the latter will not; so the ray path marks a \"line of sight\".\nIn optical experiments, a line of sight is routinely assumed to be a ray path.\nA ray as an energy path (beam).\nIf the corridor of paths reinforcing a ray path from \"A\" to \"B\" is substantially obstructed, this will significantly affect the \"energy\" reaching \"B\" from \"A\" \u2013 unlike a similar-sized obstruction outside any such corridor. Thus the ray path marks an \"energy\" path \u2013 as does a beam.\nSuppose that a wavefront expanding from point \"A\" passes point \"P\", which lies on a ray path from point \"A\" to point \"B\". By definition, all points on the wavefront have the same propagation time from \"A\". Now let the wavefront be blocked except for a window, centered on \"P\", and small enough to lie within the corridor of paths that reinforce the ray path from \"A\" to \"B\". Then all points on the unobstructed portion of the wavefront will have, nearly enough, equal propagation times to \"B\", but \"not\" to points in other directions, so that \"B\" will be in the direction of peak intensity of the beam admitted through the window. So the ray path marks the beam. And in optical experiments, a beam is routinely considered as a collection of rays or (if it is narrow) as an approximation to a ray (Fig.\u202f3).\nAnalogies.\nAccording to the \"strong\" form of Fermat's principle, the problem of finding the path of a light ray from point \"A\" in a medium of faster propagation, to point \"B\" in a medium of slower propagation (Fig.\u202f1), is analogous to the problem faced by a lifeguard in deciding where to enter the water in order to reach a drowning swimmer as soon as possible, given that the lifeguard can run faster than (s)he can swim. But that analogy falls short of \"explaining\" the behavior of the light, because the lifeguard can think about the problem (even if only for an instant) whereas the light presumably cannot. The discovery that ants are capable of similar calculations does not bridge the gap between the animate and the inanimate.\nIn contrast, the above assumptions (1) to (3) hold for any wavelike disturbance and explain Fermat's principle in purely mechanistic terms, without any imputation of knowledge or purpose.\nThe principle applies to waves in general, including (e.g.) sound waves in fluids and elastic waves in solids. In a modified form, it even works for matter\u00a0waves: in quantum mechanics, the classical path of a particle is obtainable by applying Fermat's principle to the associated wave \u2013 except that, because the frequency may vary with the path, the stationarity is in the phase\u00a0shift (or number of cycles) and not necessarily in the time.\nFermat's principle is most familiar, however, in the case of visible light: it is the link between geometrical optics, which describes certain optical phenomena in terms of \"rays\", and the wave theory of light, which explains the same phenomena on the hypothesis that light consists of \"waves\".\nEquivalence to Huygens' construction.\nIn this article we distinguish between Huygens' \"principle\", which states that every point crossed by a traveling wave becomes the source of a secondary wave, and Huygens' \"construction\", which is described below.\nLet the surface W be a wavefront at time t, and let the surface W\u2032 be the same wavefront at the later time \"t\" + \u0394\"t\" (Fig.\u202f4). Let P be a general point on W. Then, according to Huygens' construction,\nThe construction may be repeated in order to find successive positions of the primary wavefront, and successive points on the ray.\nThe ray direction given by this construction is the radial direction of the secondary wavefront, and may differ from the normal of the secondary wavefront (cf.\u00a0Fig.\u202f2), and therefore from the normal of the primary wavefront at the point of tangency. Hence the ray \"velocity\", in magnitude and direction, is the radial velocity of an infinitesimal secondary wavefront, and is generally a function of location and direction.\nNow let Q be a point on W close to P, and let Q\u2032 be a point on W\u2032 close to P\u2032. Then, by the construction,\nBy (i), the ray path is a path of stationary traversal time from P to W\u2032; and by (ii), it is a path of stationary traversal time from a point on W to P\u2032.\nSo Huygens' construction implicitly defines a ray path as \"a\u00a0path of stationary traversal time between successive positions of a wavefront\", the time being reckoned from a \"point-source\" on the earlier wavefront. This conclusion remains valid if the secondary wavefronts are reflected or refracted by surfaces of discontinuity in the properties of the medium, provided that the comparison is restricted to the affected paths and the affected portions of the wavefronts.\nFermat's principle, however, is conventionally expressed in \"point-to-point\" terms, not wavefront-to-wavefront terms. Accordingly, let us modify the example by supposing that the wavefront which becomes surface W at time t, and which becomes surface W\u2032 at the later time \"t\" + \u0394\"t\", is emitted from point A at time\u00a00. Let P be a point on W (as before), and B a point on W\u2032. And let A, W, W\u2032, and B be given, so that the problem is to find P.\nIf P satisfies Huygens' construction, so that the secondary wavefront from P is tangential to W\u2032 at B, then PB is a path of stationary traversal time from W to B. Adding the fixed time from A to W, we find that APB is the path of stationary traversal time from A to B (possibly with a restricted domain of comparison, as noted above), in accordance with Fermat's principle. The argument works just as well in the converse direction, provided that W\u2032 has a well-defined tangent plane at B. Thus Huygens' construction and Fermat's principle are geometrically equivalent.\nThrough this equivalence, Fermat's principle sustains Huygens' construction and thence all the conclusions that Huygens was able to draw from that construction. In short, \"The laws of geometrical optics may be derived from Fermat's principle\". With the exception of the Fermat\u2013Huygens principle itself, these laws are special cases in the sense that they depend on further assumptions about the media. Two of them are mentioned under the next heading.\nSpecial cases.\nIsotropic media: rays normal to wavefronts.\nIn an isotropic medium, because the propagation speed is independent of direction, the secondary wavefronts that expand from points on a primary wavefront in a given \"infinitesimal\" time are spherical, so that their radii are normal to their common tangent surface at the points of tangency. But their radii mark the ray directions, and their common tangent surface is a general wavefront. Thus the rays are normal (orthogonal) to the wavefronts.\nBecause much of the teaching of optics concentrates on isotropic media, treating anisotropic media as an optional topic, the assumption that the rays are normal to the wavefronts can become so pervasive that even Fermat's principle is explained under that assumption, although in fact Fermat's principle is more general.\nHomogeneous media: rectilinear propagation.\nIn a homogeneous medium (also called a \"uniform\" medium), all the secondary wavefronts that expand from a given primary wavefront W in a given time \u0394\"t\" are congruent and similarly oriented, so that their envelope W\u2032 may be considered as the envelope of a \"single\" secondary wavefront which preserves its orientation while its center (source) moves over W. If P is its center while P\u2032 is its point of tangency with W\u2032, then P\u2032 moves parallel to P, so that the plane tangential to W\u2032 at P\u2032 is parallel to the plane tangential to W at P. Let another (congruent and similarly orientated) secondary wavefront be centered on P\u2032, moving with P, and let it meet its envelope W\u2033 at point P\u2033. Then, by the same reasoning, the plane tangential to W\u2033 at P\u2033 is parallel to the other two planes. Hence, due to the congruence and similar orientations, the ray directions PP\u2032 and P\u2032P\u2033 are the same (but not necessarily normal to the wavefronts, since the secondary wavefronts are not necessarily spherical). This construction can be repeated any number of times, giving a straight ray of any length. Thus a homogeneous medium admits rectilinear rays.\nModern version.\nFormulation in terms of refractive index.\nLet a path \u0393 extend from point A to point B. Let s be the arc length measured along the path from A, and let t be the time taken to traverse that arc length at the ray speed formula_1 (that is, at the radial speed of the local secondary wavefront, for each location and direction on the path). Then the traversal time of the entire path \u0393 is\n(where A and B simply denote the endpoints and are not to be construed as values of t or s). The condition for \u0393 to be a \"ray\" path is that the first-order change in T due to a change in \u0393 is zero; that is,\nformula_2\nNow let us define the \"optical length\" of a given path (\"optical path length\", \"OPL\") as the distance traversed by a ray in a homogeneous isotropic reference medium (e.g., a vacuum) in the same time that it takes to traverse the given path at the local ray velocity. Then, if c denotes the propagation speed in the reference medium (e.g., the speed of light in vacuum), the optical length of a path traversed in time dt is \"dS\" = \"c\" \"dt\", and the optical length of a path traversed in time T is \"S\" = \"cT\".\u2009 So, multiplying equation\u00a0(1) through by c, we obtain\nformula_3\nwhere formula_4 is the \"ray index\" \u2013 that is, the refractive index calculated on the \"ray\" velocity instead of the usual phase velocity (wave-normal velocity). For an infinitesimal path, we have\u2009 formula_5 indicating that the optical length is the physical length multiplied by the ray index: the OPL is a notional \"geometric\" quantity, from which time has been factored out. In terms of OPL, the condition for \u0393 to be a ray path (Fermat's principle) becomes\nThis has the form of Maupertuis's principle in classical mechanics (for a single particle), with the ray index in optics taking the role of momentum or velocity in mechanics.\nIn an isotropic medium, for which the ray velocity is also the phase velocity, we may substitute the usual refractive index n for\u00a0\"n\"r.\u202f\nRelation to Hamilton's principle.\nIf \"x\", \"y\", \"z\" are Cartesian coordinates and an overdot denotes differentiation with respect to s, Fermat's principle (2) may be written\nformula_6\nIn the case of an isotropic medium, we may replace \"n\"r with the normal refractive index\u200a \"n\"(\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"), which is simply a scalar field. If we then define the \"optical Lagrangian\" as\nformula_7\nFermat's principle becomes\nformula_8\nIf the direction of propagation is always such that we can use z instead of s as the parameter of the path (and the overdot to denote differentiation w.r.t.\u00a0z instead of s), the optical Lagrangian can instead be written\nformula_9\nso that Fermat's principle becomes\nformula_10\nThis has the form of Hamilton's principle in classical mechanics, except that the time dimension is missing: the third spatial coordinate in optics takes the role of time in mechanics. The optical Lagrangian is the function which, when integrated w.r.t.\u00a0the parameter of the path, yields the OPL; it is the foundation of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian optics.\nHistory.\nIf a ray follows a straight line, it obviously takes the path of least \"length\". Hero of Alexandria, in his \"Catoptrics\" (1st century CE), showed that the ordinary law of reflection off a plane surface follows from the premise that the total \"length\" of the ray path is a minimum. Ibn al-Haytham, an 11th-century polymath later extended this principle to refraction, hence giving an early version of the Fermat's principle.\nFermat vs. the Cartesians.\nIn 1657, Pierre de Fermat received from Marin Cureau de la Chambre a copy of newly published treatise, in which La\u00a0Chambre noted Hero's principle and complained that it did not work for refraction.\nFermat replied that refraction might be brought into the same framework by supposing that light took the path of least \"resistance\", and that different media offered different resistances. His eventual solution, described in a letter to La\u00a0Chambre dated 1\u00a0January 1662, construed \"resistance\" as inversely proportional to speed, so that light took the path of least \"time\". That premise yielded the ordinary law of refraction, provided that light traveled more slowly in the optically denser medium.\nFermat's solution was a landmark in that it unified the then-known laws of geometrical optics under a \"variational principle\" or \"action principle\", setting the precedent for the principle of least action in classical mechanics and the corresponding principles in other fields (see \"History of variational principles in physics\"). It was the more notable because it used the method of \"adequality\", which may be understood in retrospect as finding the point where the slope of an infinitesimally short chord is zero, without the intermediate step of finding a general expression for the slope (the derivative).\nIt was also immediately controversial. The ordinary law of refraction was at that time attributed to Ren\u00e9 Descartes (d.\u202f1650), who had tried to explain it by supposing that light was a force that propagated \"instantaneously\", or that light was analogous to a tennis ball that traveled \"faster\" in the denser medium, either premise being inconsistent with Fermat's.\u00a0 Descartes' most prominent defender, Claude Clerselier, criticized Fermat for apparently ascribing knowledge and intent to nature, and for failing to explain why nature should prefer to economize on time rather than distance. Clerselier wrote in part:\n1. The principle that you take as the basis of your demonstration, namely that nature always acts in the shortest and simplest ways, is merely a moral principle and not a physical one; it is not, and cannot be, the cause of any effect in nature\u00a0... For otherwise we would attribute knowledge to nature; but here, by \"nature\", we understand only this order and this law established in the world as it is, which acts without foresight, without choice, and by a necessary determination.\n2. This same principle would make nature irresolute\u00a0... For I ask you\u00a0... when a ray of light must pass from a point in a rare medium to a point in a dense one, is there not reason for nature to hesitate if, by your principle, it must choose the straight line as soon as the bent one, since if the latter proves shorter in time, the former is shorter and simpler in length? Who will decide and who will pronounce?\u202f\nFermat, being unaware of the mechanistic foundations of his own principle, was not well placed to defend it, except as a purely geometric and kinematic proposition.\u00a0 The wave theory of light, first proposed by Robert Hooke in the year of Fermat's death, and rapidly improved by Ignace-Gaston Pardies and (especially) Christiaan Huygens, contained the necessary foundations; but the recognition of this fact was surprisingly slow.\nHuygens's oversight.\nIn 1678, Huygens proposed that every point reached by a luminous disturbance becomes a source of a spherical wave; the sum of these secondary waves determines the form of the wave at any subsequent time. Huygens repeatedly referred to the envelope of his secondary wavefronts as the \"termination\" of the movement, meaning that the later wavefront was the outer boundary that the disturbance could reach in a given time, which was therefore the minimum time in which each point on the later wavefront could be reached. But he did not argue that the \"direction\" of minimum time was that from the secondary source to the point of tangency; instead, he deduced the ray direction from the extent of the common tangent surface corresponding to a given extent of the initial wavefront. His only endorsement of Fermat's principle was limited in scope: having derived the law of ordinary refraction, for which the rays are normal to the wavefronts, Huygens gave a geometric proof that a ray refracted according to this law takes the path of least time. He would hardly have thought this necessary if he had known that the principle of least time followed \"directly\" from the same common-tangent construction by which he had deduced not only the law of ordinary refraction, but also the laws of rectilinear propagation and ordinary reflection (which were also known to follow from Fermat's principle), and a previously unknown law of extraordinary refraction \u2013 the last by means of secondary wavefronts that were spheroidal rather than spherical, with the result that the rays were generally oblique to the wavefronts. It was as if Huygens had not noticed that his construction implied Fermat's principle, and even as if he thought he had found an exception to that principle. Manuscript evidence cited by Alan E.\u2009Shapiro tends to confirm that Huygens believed the principle of least time to be invalid \"in double refraction, where the rays are not normal to the wave fronts\".\nShapiro further reports that the only three authorities who accepted \"Huygens' principle\" in the 17th and 18th centuries, namely Philippe de La Hire, Denis Papin, and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, did so because it accounted for the extraordinary refraction of \"Iceland crystal\" (calcite) in the same manner as the previously known laws of geometrical optics. But, for the time being, the corresponding extension of Fermat's principle went unnoticed.\nLaplace, Young, Fresnel, and Lorentz.\nOn 30 January 1809, Pierre-Simon Laplace, reporting on the work of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 \u00c9tienne-Louis Malus, claimed that the extraordinary refraction of calcite could be explained under the corpuscular theory of light with the aid of Maupertuis's principle of least action: that the integral of speed with respect to distance was a minimum. The corpuscular speed that satisfied this principle was proportional to the reciprocal of the ray speed given by the radius of Huygens' spheroid. Laplace continued:\nAccording to Huygens, the velocity of the extraordinary ray, in the crystal, is simply expressed by the radius of the spheroid; consequently his hypothesis \"does not agree\" with the principle of the least action: but \"it is remarkable\" that it agrees with the principle of Fermat, which is, that light passes, from a given point without the crystal, to a given point within it, in the least possible time; for it is easy to see that this principle coincides with that of the least action, if we invert the expression of the velocity.\nLaplace's report was the subject of a wide-ranging rebuttal by Thomas Young, who wrote in part:\nThe principle of Fermat, although it was assumed by that mathematician on hypothetical, or even imaginary grounds, is in fact a fundamental law with respect to undulatory motion, and is explicitly [\"sic\"] the basis of every determination in the Huygenian theory...\u00a0 Mr.\u00a0Laplace seems to be unacquainted with this most essential principle of one of the two theories which he compares; for he says, that \"it is remarkable\" that the Huygenian law of extraordinary refraction agrees with the principle of Fermat; which he would scarcely have observed, if he had been aware that the law was an immediate consequence of the principle.\nIn fact Laplace \"was\" aware that Fermat's principle follows from Huygens' construction in the case of refraction from an isotropic medium to an anisotropic one; a geometric proof was contained in the long version of Laplace's report, printed in 1810.\nYoung's claim was more general than Laplace's, and likewise upheld Fermat's principle even in the case of extraordinary refraction, in which the rays are generally \"not\u00a0perpendicular\" to the wavefronts. Unfortunately, however, the omitted middle sentence of the quoted paragraph by Young began \"The motion of every undulation must necessarily be in a direction \"perpendicular\" to its surface\u00a0...\" (emphasis added), and was therefore bound to sow confusion rather than clarity.\nNo such confusion subsists in Augustin-Jean Fresnel's \"Second Memoir\" on double refraction (Fresnel,\u00a01827), which addresses Fermat's principle in several places (without naming Fermat), proceeding from the special case in which rays are normal to wavefronts, to the general case in which rays are paths of least time or stationary time. (In the following summary, page numbers refer to Alfred W.\u2009Hobson's translation.)\nThus Fresnel showed, even for anisotropic media, that the ray path given by Huygens' construction is the path of least time between successive positions of a plane or diverging wavefront, that the ray velocities are the radii of the secondary \"wave surface\" after unit time, and that a stationary traversal time accounts for the direction of maximum intensity of a beam. However, establishing the general equivalence between Huygens' construction and Fermat's principle would have required further consideration of Fermat's principle in point-to-point terms.\nHendrik Lorentz, in a paper written in 1886 and republished in 1907, deduced the principle of least time in point-to-point form from Huygens' construction. But the essence of his argument was somewhat obscured by an apparent dependence on aether and aether drag.\nLorentz's work was cited in 1959 by Adriaan J.\u00a0de Witte, who then offered his own argument, which \"although in essence the same, is believed to be more cogent and more general\". De\u00a0Witte's treatment is more original than that description might suggest, although limited to two dimensions; it uses calculus of variations to show that Huygens' construction and Fermat's principle lead to the same differential equation for the ray path, and that in the case of Fermat's principle, the converse holds. De\u00a0Witte also noted that \"The matter seems to have escaped treatment in textbooks.\"\nIn popular culture.\n\"Story of Your Life\", a short story by Ted Chiang, contains visual depictions of Fermat's principle along with a discussion of its teleological dimension. Keith Devlin's \"The Math Instinct\" contains a chapter, \"Elvis the Welsh Corgi Who Can Do Calculus\", that discusses the calculus \"embedded\" in some animals as they solve the \"least time\" problem in actual situations.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Societies are characterized by patterns of relationships (social relations) between individuals who share a distinctive culture and institutions; a given society may be described as the sum total of such relationships among its constituent members.\nHuman social structures are complex and highly cooperative, featuring the specialization of labor via social roles. Societies construct roles and other patterns of behavior by deeming certain actions or concepts acceptable or unacceptable\u2014these expectations around behavior within a given society are known as societal norms. So far as it is collaborative, a society can enable its members to benefit in ways that would otherwise be difficult on an individual basis.\nSocieties vary based on level of technology and type of economic activity. Larger societies with larger food surpluses often exhibit stratification or dominance patterns. Societies can have many different forms of government, various ways of understanding kinship, and different gender roles. Human behavior varies immensely between different societies; humans shape society, but society in turn shapes human beings.\nEtymology and usage.\nThe term \"society\" often refers to a large group of people in an ordered community, in a country or several similar countries, or the \"state of being with other people\", as in \"they lived in medieval society\".\nThe term dates back to at least 1513 and comes from the 12th-century French (modern French ) meaning 'company'. was in turn derived from the Latin word ('fellowship, alliance, association'), which in turn was derived from the noun ('comrade, friend, ally').\nThe word \"social\" derives from the Latin word ('allies'). It is particularly derived from the Italian states, historical allies of the Roman Republic, though they rebelled against Rome in the Social War of 91\u201387 BC.\nConceptions.\nIn biology.\nHumans, along with their closest relatives bonobos and chimpanzees, are highly social animals. This biological context suggests that the underlying sociability required for the formation of societies is hardwired into human nature. Human society features high degrees of cooperation, and differs in important ways from groups of chimps and bonobos, including the parental role of males, the use of language to communicate, the specialization of labor, and the tendency to build \"nests\" (multigenerational camps, town, or cities).\nSome biologists, including entomologist E.O. Wilson, categorize humans as eusocial, placing humans with ants in the highest level of sociability on the spectrum of animal ethology, although others disagree. Social group living may have evolved in humans due to group selection in physical environments that made survival difficult.\nIn sociology.\nIn Western sociology, there are three dominant paradigms for understanding society: functionalism (also known as structural functionalism), conflict theory, and symbolic interactionism.\nIn the view of Karl Marx, human beings are intrinsically, necessarily and by definition social beings who, beyond being \"gregarious creatures\", cannot survive and meet their needs other than through social co-operation and association. Their social characteristics are therefore to a large extent an objectively given fact, stamped on them from birth and affirmed by socialization processes; and, according to Marx, in producing and reproducing their material life, people must necessarily enter into relations of production which are \"independent of their will\".\nBy contrast, the sociologist Max Weber for example defines human action as \"social\" if, by virtue of the subjective meanings attached to the action by individuals, it \"takes account of the behavior of others, and is thereby oriented in its course\".\nFunctionalism.\nAccording to the functionalist school of thought, individuals in society work together like organs in the body to create emergent behavior, sometimes referred to as collective consciousness. 19th century sociologists Auguste Comte and \u00c9mile Durkheim, for example, believed that society constitutes a separate \"level\" of reality, distinct from both biological and inorganic matter. Explanations of social phenomena had therefore to be constructed within this level, individuals being merely transient occupants of comparatively stable social roles.\nConflict theory.\nConflict theorists take the opposite view, and posit that individuals and social groups or social classes within society interact on the basis of conflict rather than agreement. One prominent conflict theorist is Karl Marx who conceived of society as operating on an economic \"base\" with a \"superstructure\" of government, family, religion and culture. Marx argues that the economic base determines the superstructure, and that throughout history, societal change has been driven by conflict between laborers and those who own the means of production.\nSymbolic interactionism.\nSymbolic interactionism is a microsociological theory that focuses on individuals and how the individual relates to society. Symbolic interactionists study humans' use of shared language to create common symbols and meanings, and use this frame of reference to understand how individuals interact to create symbolic worlds, and in turn, how these worlds shape individual behaviors.\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, theorists began to view society as socially constructed. In this vein, sociologist Peter L. Berger describes society as \"dialectic\": Society is created by humans, but this creation turns in turn creates or molds humans.\nNon-Western views.\nThe sociologic emphasis placed on functionalism, conflict theory, and symbolic interactionism, has been criticized as Eurocentric. The Malaysian sociologist Syed Farid al-Attas, for example, argues that Western thinkers are particularly interested in the implications of modernity, and that their analysis of non-Western cultures is therefore limited in scope. As examples of nonwestern thinkers who took a systematic approach to understanding society, al-Attas mentions Ibn Khaldun (1332\u20131406) and Jos\u00e9 Rizal (1861\u20131896).\nKhaldun, an Arab living in the 14th century, understood society, along with the rest of the universe, as having \"meaningful configuration\", with its perceived randomness attributable to hidden causes. Khaldun conceptualized social structures as having two fundamental forms: nomadic and sedentary. Nomadic life has high social cohesion (\"asabijja\"), which Khaldun argued arose from kinship, shared customs, and a shared need for defense. Sedentary life, in Khaldun's view, was marked by secularization, decreased social cohesion, and increased interest in luxury. Rizal was a Filipino nationalist living toward the end of the Spanish Colonial Period who theorized about colonial societies. Rizal argued that indolence, which the Spanish used to justify their colonial occupation, was instead caused by the colonial occupation. Rizal compared the pre-colonial era, when the Filipinos controlled trade routes and had higher economic activity, to the period of colonial rule, and argued that exploitation, economic disorder, and colonial policies that discouraged farming led to a decreased interest in work.\nTypes.\nSociologists tend to classify societies based on their level of technology, and place societies in three broad categories: pre-industrial, industrial, and postindustrial.\nSubdivisions of these categories vary, and classifications are often based on level of technology, communication, and economy. One example of such a classification comes from sociologist Gerhard Lenski who lists: (1) hunting and gathering; (2) horticultural; (3) agricultural; and (4) industrial; as well as specialized societies (e.g., fishing or herding).\nSome cultures have developed over time toward more complex forms of organization and control. This cultural evolution has a profound effect on patterns of community. Hunter-gatherer tribes have, at times, settled around seasonal food stocks to become agrarian villages. Villages have grown to become towns and cities. Cities have turned into city-states and nation-states. However, these processes are not unidirectional.\nPre-industrial.\nIn a pre-industrial society, food production, which is carried out through the use of human and animal labor, is the main economic activity. These societies can be subdivided according to their level of technology and their method of producing food. These subdivisions are hunting and gathering, pastoral, horticultural, and agrarian.\nHunting and gathering.\nThe main form of food production in hunter-gatherer societies is the daily collection of wild plants and the hunting of wild animals. Hunter-gatherers move around constantly in search of food. As a result, they do not build permanent villages or create a wide variety of artifacts. The need for mobility also limits the size of these societies, and they usually only form small groups such as bands and tribes, usually with fewer than 50 people per community. Bands and tribes are relatively egalitarian, and decisions are reached through consensus. There are no formal political offices containing real power in band societies, rather a chief is merely a person of influence, and leadership is based on personal qualities. The family forms the main social unit, with most members being related by birth or marriage.\nThe anthropologist Marshall Sahlins described hunter-gatherers as the \"original affluent society\" due to their extended leisure time: Sahlins estimated that adults in hunter gatherer societies work three to five hours per day. This perspective has been challenged by other researchers, who have pointed out high mortality rates and perennial warfare in hunter-gatherer societies. Proponents of Sahlins' view argue that the general well-being of humans in hunter gatherer societies challenges the purported relationship between technological advancement and human progress.\nPastoral.\nRather than searching for food on a daily basis, members of a pastoral society rely on domesticated herd animals to meet their food needs. Pastoralists typically live a nomadic life, moving their herds from one pasture to another. Community size in pastoral societies is similar to hunter-gatherers (about 50 individuals), but unlike hunter gatherers, pastoral societies usually consist of multiple communities\u2014the average pastoral society contains thousands of people. This is because pastoral groups tend to live in open areas where movement is easy, which enables political integration. Pastoral societies tend to create a food surplus, and have specialized labor and high levels of inequality.\nHorticultural.\nFruits and vegetables grown in garden plots, that have been cleared from the jungle or forest, provide the main source of food in a horticultural society. These societies have a similar level of technology and complexity to pastoral societies. Along with pastoral societies, horticultural societies emerged about 10,000 years ago, after technological changes of the Agricultural Revolution made it possible to cultivate crops and raise animals. Horticulturists use human labor and simple tools to cultivate the land for one or more seasons. When the land becomes barren, horticulturists clear a new plot and leave the old plot to revert to its natural state. They may return to the original land several years later and begin the process again. By rotating their garden plots, horticulturists can stay in one area for a long period of time. This allows them to build permanent or semi-permanent villages.\nAs with pastoral societies, surplus food leads to a more complex division of labor. Specialized roles in horticultural societies include craftspeople, shamans (religious leaders), and traders. This role specialization allows horticultural societies to create a variety of artifacts. Scarce, defensible resources can lead to wealth inequalities in horticultural political systems.\nAgrarian.\nAgrarian societies use agricultural technological advances to cultivate crops over a large area. Lenski differentiates between horticultural and agrarian societies by the use of the plow. Larger food supplies due to improved technology mean agrarian communities are larger than horticultural communities. A greater food surplus results in towns that become centers of trade. Economic trade in turn leads to increased specialization, including a ruling class, as well as educators, craftspeople, merchants, and religious figures, who do not directly participate in the production of food.\nAgrarian societies are especially noted for their extremes of social classes and rigid social mobility. As land is the major source of wealth, social hierarchy develops based on landownership and not labor. The system of stratification is characterized by three coinciding contrasts: governing class versus the masses, urban minority versus peasant majority, and literate minority versus illiterate majority. This results in two distinct subcultures; the urban elite versus the peasant masses. Moreover, this means cultural differences within agrarian societies are greater than differences between them.\nThe landowning strata typically combine government, religious, and military institutions to justify and enforce their ownership, and support elaborate patterns of consumption, slavery, serfdom, or peonage is commonly the lot of the primary producer. Rulers of agrarian societies often do not manage their empire for the common good or in the name of the public interest, but as property they own. Caste systems, as historically found in South Asia, are associated with agrarian societies, where lifelong agricultural routines depend upon a rigid sense of duty and discipline. The scholar Donald Brown suggests that an emphasis in the modern West on personal liberties and freedoms was in large part a reaction to the steep and rigid stratification of agrarian societies.\nIndustrial.\nIndustrial societies, which emerged in the 18th century in the Industrial Revolution, rely heavily on machines powered by external sources for the mass production of goods. Whereas in pre-industrial societies the majority of labor takes place in primary industries focused on extracting raw materials (farming, fishing, mining, etc.), in industrial societies, labor is mostly focused on processing raw materials into finished products. Present-day societies vary in their degree of industrialization, with some using mostly newer energy sources (e.g. coal, oil, and nuclear energy), and others continuing to rely on human and animal power.\nIndustrialization is associated with population booms and the growth of cities. Increased productivity, as well as the stability caused by improved transportation, leads to decreased mortality and resulting population growth. Centralized production of goods in factories and a decreased need for agricultural labor leads to urbanization. Industrial societies are often capitalist, and have high degrees of inequality along with high social mobility, as businesspeople use the market to amass large amounts of wealth. Working conditions in factories are generally restrictive and harsh. Workers, who have common interests, may organize into labor unions to advance those interests.\nOn the whole, industrial societies are marked by the increased power of human beings. Technological advancements mean that industrial societies have increased potential for deadly warfare. Governments use information technologies to exert greater control over the populace. Industrial societies also have an increased environmental impact.\nPost-industrial.\nPost-industrial societies are societies dominated by information and services, rather than the production of goods. Advanced industrial societies see a shift toward an increase in service sectors, over manufacturing. Service industries include education, health and finance.\nInformation.\nAn information society is a society where the usage, creation, distribution, manipulation and integration of information is a significant activity. Proponents of the idea that modern-day global society is an information society posit that information technologies are impacting most important forms of social organization, including education, economy, health, government, warfare, and levels of democracy. Although the concept of information society has been discussed since the 1930s, in the present day, it is almost always applied to ways that information technologies impact society and culture. It therefore covers the effects of computers and telecommunications on the home, the workplace, schools, government, and various communities and organizations, as well as the emergence of new social forms in cyberspace.\nKnowledge.\nAs the access to electronic information resources increased at the beginning of the 21st century, special attention was extended from the information society to the knowledge society. A knowledge society generates, shares, and makes available to all members of the society knowledge that may be used to improve the human condition. A knowledge society differs from an information society in that it transforms information into resources that allow society to take effective action, rather than only creating and disseminating raw data.\nCharacteristics.\nNorms and roles.\nSocial norms are shared standards of acceptable behavior by groups. Social norms, which can both be informal understandings that govern the behavior of members of a society, as well as be codified into rules and laws, are powerful drivers of human behavior.\nSocial roles are norms, duties, and patterns of behavior that relate to an individual's social status. In functionalist thought, individuals form the structure of society by occupying social roles. According to symbolic interactionism, individuals use symbols to navigate and communicate roles. Erving Goffman used the metaphor of a theater to develop the dramaturgical lens, which argues that roles provide scripts that govern social interactions.\nGender and kinship.\nThe division of humans into male and female gender roles has been marked culturally by a corresponding division of norms, practices, dress, behavior, rights, duties, privileges, status, and power. Some argue that gender roles arise naturally from sex differences, which lead to a division of labor where women take on reproductive labor and other domestic roles. Gender roles have varied historically, and challenges to predominant gender norms have recurred in many societies.\nAll human societies organize, recognize and classify types of social relationships based on relations between parents, children and other descendants (consanguinity), and relations through marriage (affinity). There is also a third type of familial relationship applied to godparents or adoptive children (fictive). These culturally defined relationships are referred to as kinship. In many societies, it is one of the most important social organizing principles and plays a role in transmitting status and inheritance.\u00a0All societies have rules of incest taboo, according to which marriage between certain kinds of kin relations are prohibited; and some societies also have rules of preferential marriage with certain other kin relations.\nEthnicity.\nHuman ethnic groups are a social category that identify together as a group based on shared attributes that distinguish them from other groups. These shared attributes can be a common set of traditions, ancestry, language, history, society, culture, nation, religion, or social treatment within their residing area. There is no generally accepted definition of what constitutes an ethnic group, and humans have evolved the ability to change affiliation with social groups relatively easily, including leaving groups with previously strong alliances, if doing so is seen as providing personal advantages. Ethnicity is separate from the concept of race, which is based on physical characteristics, although both are socially constructed. Assigning ethnicity to a certain population is complicated, as even within common ethnic designations there can be a diverse range of subgroups, and the makeup of these ethnic groups can change over time at both the collective and individual level. Ethnic groupings can play a powerful role in the social identity and solidarity of ethnopolitical units. Ethnic identity has been closely tied to the rise of the nation state as the predominant form of political organization in the 19th and 20th centuries.\nGovernment and politics.\nGovernments create laws and policies that affect the people that they govern. There have been many forms of government throughout human history, with various ways of allocating power, and with different levels and means of control over the population. In early history, distribution of political power was determined by the availability of fresh water, fertile soil, and temperate climate of different locations. As farming populations gathered in larger and denser communities, interactions between different groups increased, leading to the further development of governance within and between communities.\nAs of 2022[ [update]], according to \"The Economist\", 43% of national governments were democracies, 35% autocracies, and 22% containing elements of both. Many countries have formed international political organizations and alliances, the largest being the United Nations with 193 member states.\nTrade and economics.\nTrade, the voluntary exchange of goods and services, has long been an aspect of human societies, and it is seen as a characteristic that differentiates humans from other animals. Trade has even been cited as a practice that gave \"Homo sapiens\" a major advantage over other hominids; evidence suggests early \"H. sapiens\" made use of long-distance trade routes to exchange goods and ideas, leading to cultural explosions and providing additional food sources when hunting was sparse. Such trade networks did not exist for the now-extinct Neanderthals. Early trade involved materials for creating tools, like obsidian, exchanged over short distances. In contrast, throughout antiquity and the medieval period, some of the most influential long-distance routes carried food and luxury goods, such as the spice trade.\nEarly human economies were more likely to be based around gift giving than a bartering system. Early money consisted of commodities; the oldest being in the form of cattle and the most widely used being cowrie shells. Money has since evolved into governmental issued coins, paper and electronic money. Human study of economics is a social science that looks at how societies distribute scarce resources among different people. There are massive inequalities in the division of wealth among humans; as of 2018 in China, Europe, and the United States, the richest tenth of humans hold more than seven-tenths of those regions' total wealth.\nConflict.\nThe willingness of humans to kill other members of their species \"en masse\" through organized conflict (i.e. war) has long been the subject of debate. One school of thought is that war evolved as a means to eliminate competitors, and that violence is an innate human characteristic. Humans commit violence against other humans at a rate comparable to other primates (although humans kill adults at a relatively high rate and have a relatively low rate of infanticide).\nAnother school of thought suggests that war is a relatively recent phenomenon and appeared due to changing social conditions. While not settled, the current evidence suggests warlike behavior only became common about 10,000 years ago, and in many regions even more recently.\nPhylogenetic analysis predicts 2% of human deaths to be caused by homicide, which approximately matches the rate of homicide in band societies. However, rates of violence vary widely according to societal norms, and rates of homicide in societies that have legal systems and strong cultural attitudes against violence stand at about 0.01%.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He has written spin-off novels for \"Star Wars\", \"StarCraft\", \"Titan A.E.\" and \"The X-Files\", and with Brian Herbert is the co-author of the \"Dune\" prequel series. His original works include the \"Saga of Seven Suns\" series and the Nebula Award\u2013nominated \"Assemblers of Infinity\". He has also written several comic books, including the Dark Horse \"Star Wars\" series \"Tales of the Jedi\" written in collaboration with Tom Veitch, Dark Horse \"Predator\" titles, and \"The X-Files\" titles for Topps. Some of Anderson's superhero novels include \"Enemies &amp; Allies\", about the first meeting of Batman and Superman, and \"The Last Days of Krypton\", telling the story of how Superman's planet Krypton came to be destroyed.\nAnderson has published over 140 books, over 50 of which have been on US and international bestseller lists, and he has more than 23 million books in print worldwide.\nAnderson is working as a professor at Western Colorado University. Anderson has been a Literary Guest of Honor and Keynote Speaker at the Life, the Universe, &amp; Everything professional science fiction and fantasy arts symposium, on at least three occasions: 2016, 2006 and 1993. In 2021, Anderson was inducted into the Colorado Authors Hall of Fame along with Stephen King and James Michener. He has twice won the Scribe Award and in 2012 was elected Grandmaster of the International Association of Media Tie-In Writers.\nEarly and personal life.\nKevin J. Anderson was born March 27, 1962, in Racine, Wisconsin, and grew up in Oregon, Wisconsin. According to Anderson, \"The War of the Worlds\" greatly influenced him. At the age of eight, he wrote his first story, titled \"Injection\". At ten, he bought a typewriter and has written ever since. In his freshman year in high school, he submitted his first short story to a magazine, but it took two more years before one of his manuscripts was accepted. When it was accepted, they paid him in copies of the magazine. In his senior year, he sold his first story for money for $12.50.\nFor 12 years Anderson worked at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where he met fellow writers Rebecca Moesta and Doug Beason. Anderson later married Moesta and frequently coauthors novels with both her and Beason.\nCareer.\nAnderson's first novel, \"Resurrection, Inc.\", was published in 1988 and nominated for a Bram Stoker Award for Best First Novel. His 1993 collaboration with Beason, \"Assemblers of Infinity\", was nominated for both a Nebula and Locus Award. Anderson wrote \"The X-Files\" novels \"Ground Zero\" (1995), \"Ruins\" (1996) and \"Antibodies\" (1997). \"Ground Zero\" reached #1 on the \"London Sunday Times\" Best Seller List and \"Ruins\" made the \"New York Times\" Best Seller list. Contracted to write novels in the \"Star Wars\" expanded universe, Anderson published the \"Jedi Academy\" trilogy in 1994, followed by the 1996 novel \"Darksaber\". He and Moesta also wrote the 14-volume \"Young Jedi Knights\" series from 1995 to 1998. As a noted \"Star Wars\" novelist, Anderson was a participant in the FidoNet \"Star Wars\" Echo, a 1990s bulletin board system forum cited as one of the earliest influential forms of \"Star Wars\" on-line fandom.\nIn 1997, Anderson and Brian Herbert signed a $3 million deal with Bantam Books to coauthor a prequel trilogy to the 1965 novel \"Dune\" and its five sequels (1969\u20131985) by Herbert's deceased father, Frank Herbert. Starting with 1999's ', the ongoing \"Dune\" prequel series has expanded to ten novels to date. In 2011 \"Publishers Weekly\" called the series \"a sprawling edifice that Frank Herbert's son and Anderson have built on the foundation of the original \"Dune\" novels.\" Anderson and Brian Herbert have also published \"Hunters of Dune\" (2006) and \"Sandworms of Dune\" (2007), sequels to Frank Herbert's final novel ' (1985) which complete the chronological progression of his original series and wrap up storylines that began with his \"Heretics of Dune\" (1984). Between 2011 and 2014, Anderson and Herbert also released their \"Hellhole\" trilogy of novels unrelated to \"Dune\".\nIn 2002, Anderson released the steampunk/adventure novel \"\" and was subsequently asked to write \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" (2003), a novelization of the film of the same name. The following year he also wrote the novelization for the 2004 film \"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\". In 2005, Anderson co-wrote, along with Dean Koontz, the first book in the Frankenstein series called \"Frankenstein, Prodigal Son\".\nBetween 2002 and 2008, Anderson published a seven-novel original space opera series called \"The Saga of Seven Suns\". In 2014 he began publishing a sequel trilogy called \"The Saga of Shadows\". Anderson published four novels and two short stories in his \"Dan Shamble, Zombie P.I.\" series between 2012 and 2014. In 2012, Anderson coauthored a novelization of \"Clockwork Angels\", an album by the Canadian rock band Rush, with Rush's drummer, Neil Peart. Anderson and Peart reunited in 2015 for a sequel, \"Clockwork Lives\". The original novelisation would win a Scribe Award for Best Adapted Novel\nWordFire Press.\nIn 2011, Anderson and Moesta founded their own publishing imprint, WordFire Press, to reissue some of their out-of-print books in paperback and/or e-book formats. They have subsequently published and reprinted works in various genres, including several out-of-print or previously unpublished novels by Frank Herbert.\nIn 2013, WordFire acquired the reprint rights to the works of Allen Drury, including his 1959 Pulitzer Prize-winning political novel \"Advise and Consent\". That novel, out of print for nearly 15 years, ranked #27 on the 2013 BookFinder.com list of the Top 100 Most Searched for Out of Print Books before WordFire reissued it in February 2014.

Washington", "text": "American educator, author, orator and adviser\nBooker Taliaferro Washington (April 5, 1856\u00a0\u2013 November 14, 1915) was an American educator, author, and orator. Between 1890 and 1915, Washington was the primary leader in the African-American community and of the contemporary Black elite.\nBorn into slavery on April 5, 1856, in Hale's Ford, Virginia, Washington was freed when U.S. troops reached the area during the Civil War. As a young man, Booker T. Washington worked his way through Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute and attended college at Wayland Seminary. In 1881, he was named as the first leader of the new Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, an institute for black higher education. He expanded the college, enlisting students in construction of buildings. Work at the college was considered fundamental to students' larger education. He attained national prominence for his Atlanta Address of 1895, which attracted the attention of politicians and the public. Washington played a dominant role in black politics, winning wide support in the black community of the South and among more liberal whites. Washington wrote an autobiography, \"Up from Slavery\", in 1901, which became a major text. In that year, he dined with Theodore Roosevelt at the White House, which was the first time a black person publicly met the president on equal terms. After an illness, he died in Tuskegee, Alabama on November 14, 1915.\nWashington was a key proponent of African-American businesses and one of the founders of the National Negro Business League. Washington mobilized a nationwide coalition of middle-class blacks, church leaders, and white philanthropists and politicians, with the goal of building the community's economic strength and pride by focusing on self-help and education. Washington had the ear of the powerful in the United States of his day, including presidents. He used the nineteenth-century American political system to manipulate the media, raise money, develop strategy, network, distribute funds, and reward a cadre of supporters. Because of his influential leadership, the timespan of his activity, from 1880 to 1915, has been called the Age of Booker T. Washington. Washington called for Black progress through education and entrepreneurship, rather than trying to challenge directly the Jim Crow segregation and the disenfranchisement of Black voters in the South. Furthermore, he supported racial uplift, but secretly also supported court challenges to segregation and to restrictions on voter registration. Black activists in the North, led by W. E. B. Du Bois, disagreed with him and opted to set up the NAACP to work for political change.\nAfter his death in 1915, he came under heavy criticism for accommodating white supremacy, despite his claims that his long-term goal was to end the disenfranchisement of African Americans, the vast majority of whom still lived in the South. Decades after Washington's death in 1915, the civil rights movement of the 1950s took a more active and progressive approach, which was also based on new grassroots organizations based in the South. Washington's legacy has been controversial in the civil rights community. However, in the late twentieth century, more nuanced perspectives about his actions by scholars and historians interpreted him more positively. \nEarly life.\nBooker was born into slavery to Jane, an enslaved African-American woman on the plantation of James Burroughs in southwest Virginia, near Hale's Ford in Franklin County. He never knew the day, month, and year of his birth (although evidence emerged after his death that he was born on April 5, 1856). Nor did he ever know his father, said to be a white man who resided on a neighboring plantation. The man played no financial or emotional role in Washington's life. \nFrom his earliest years, Washington was known simply as \"Booker\", with no middle or surname, in the practice of the time. His mother, her relatives and his siblings struggled with the demands of slavery. He later wrote:\nI cannot remember a single instance during my childhood or early boyhood when our entire family sat down to the table together, and God's blessing was asked, and the family ate a meal in a civilized manner. On the plantation in Virginia, and even later, meals were gotten to the children very much as dumb animals get theirs. It was a piece of bread here and a scrap of meat there. It was a cup of milk at one time and some potatoes at another.\nWhen he was nine, Booker and his family in Virginia gained freedom under the Emancipation Proclamation as U.S. troops occupied their region. Booker was thrilled by the formal day of their emancipation in early 1865:\nAs the great day drew nearer, there was more singing in the slave quarters than usual. It was bolder, had more ring, and lasted later into the night. Most of the verses of the plantation songs had some reference to freedom... [S]ome man who seemed to be a stranger (a United States officer, I presume) made a little speech and then read a rather long paper\u2014the Emancipation Proclamation, I think. After the reading we were told that we were all free, and could go when and where we pleased. My mother, who was standing by my side, leaned over and kissed her children, while tears of joy ran down her cheeks. She explained to us what it all meant, that this was the day for which she had been so long praying, but fearing that she would never live to see.\nAfter emancipation Jane took her family to the free state of West Virginia to join her husband, Washington Ferguson, who had escaped from slavery during the war and settled there. The illiterate boy Booker began painstakingly to teach himself to read and attended school for the first time.\nAt school, Booker was asked for a surname for registration. He chose the family name of Washington. Still later he learned from his mother that she had originally given him the name \"Booker Taliaferro\" at the time of his birth, but his second name was not used by the master. Upon learning of his original name, Washington immediately readopted it as his own, and became known as Booker Taliaferro Washington for the rest of his life.\nBooker loved books:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHigher education.\nWashington worked in salt furnaces and coal mines in West Virginia for several years to earn money. At age 16, he made his way east\u2014mostly on foot\u2014to Hampton Institute, a school established in Virginia to educate freedmen and their descendants, where he also worked as a janitor to pay for his studies. Washington arrived to campus with very little money; and his entrance exam was to clean a room. Upon graduating from Hampton at age 19, Washington briefly returned home to West Virginia. He later attended Wayland Seminary in Washington, D.C. in 1878.\nTuskegee Institute.\nIn 1881, the Hampton Institute president Samuel C. Armstrong recommended Washington, then age 25, to become the first leader of Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute (later Tuskegee Institute, now Tuskegee University), the new normal school (teachers' college) in Alabama. The new school opened on July 4, 1881, initially using a room donated by Butler Chapel A.M.E. Zion Church.\nThe next year, Washington purchased a former plantation to be developed as the permanent site of the campus. Under his direction, his students literally built their own school: making bricks, constructing classrooms, barns and outbuildings; and growing their own crops and raising livestock; both for learning and to provide for most of the basic necessities. Both men and women had to learn trades as well as academics. The Tuskegee faculty used all the activities to teach the students basic skills to take back to their mostly rural black communities throughout the South. The main goal was not to produce farmers and tradesmen, but teachers of farming and trades who could teach in the new lower schools and colleges for blacks across the South. The school expanded over the decades, adding programs and departments, to become the present-day Tuskegee University.\nThe Oaks, \"a large comfortable home,\" was built on campus for Washington and his family. They moved into the house in 1900. Washington lived there until his death in 1915. His widow, Margaret, lived at The Oaks until her death in 1925.\nIn 1896 when Washington reviewed the study conducted by George Washington Carver about the infection plaguing the soybean crop he invited Carver to head the Agriculture Department at Tuskegee, where they became close friends. Carver later autographed commemorative stamps issued in 1940 in Washington's honor.\nTuskegee Machine.\nWashington led Tuskegee for more than 30 years after becoming its leader. As he developed it, adding to both the curriculum and the facilities on the campus, he became a prominent national leader among African Americans, with considerable influence with wealthy white philanthropists and politicians. The political network that Washington formed, headquartered at the Tuskegee Institute, was called the \"Tuskegee Machine\" .\nWashington expressed his vision for his race through the school. He believed that by providing needed skills to society, African Americans would play their part, leading to acceptance by white Americans. He believed that blacks would eventually gain full participation in society by acting as responsible, reliable American citizens. Shortly after the Spanish\u2013American War, President William McKinley and most of his cabinet visited Booker Washington. By his death in 1915, Tuskegee had grown to encompass more than 100 well-equipped buildings, roughly 1,500 students, 200 faculty members teaching 38 trades and professions, and an endowment of approximately $2\u00a0million (~$ in 2024).\nWashington helped develop other schools and colleges. In 1891 he lobbied the West Virginia legislature to locate the newly authorized West Virginia Colored Institute (today West Virginia State University) in the Kanawha Valley of West Virginia near Charleston. He visited the campus often and spoke at its first commencement exercise.\nWashington was a dominant figure of the African-American community, then still overwhelmingly based in the South, from 1890 to his death in 1915. His Atlanta Address of 1895 received national attention. He was a popular spokesman for African-American citizens. Representing the last generation of black leaders born into slavery, Washington was generally perceived as a supporter of education for freedmen and their descendants in the post-Reconstruction, Jim Crow-era South. He stressed basic education and training in the skills of the tradesperson and domestic because he thought these represented the work abilities most needed in what was still a rural economy.\nThroughout the final twenty years of his life, he maintained his standing through a nationwide network of supporters including black educators, ministers, editors, and businessmen, especially those who supported his views on social and educational issues for blacks. He also gained access to top national white leaders in politics, philanthropy and education, raised large sums, was consulted on race issues, and was awarded honorary degrees from Harvard University in 1896 and Dartmouth College in 1901.\nLate in his career, Washington was criticized by civil rights leader and NAACP founder W. E. B. Du Bois. Du Bois and his supporters opposed the Atlanta Address as the \"Atlanta Compromise\", because it suggested that African Americans should work for, and submit to, white political rule. Du Bois insisted on full civil rights, due process of law, and increased political representation for African Americans which, he believed, could only be achieved through activism and higher education for African Americans. He believed that \"the talented tenth\" would lead the race. Du Bois labeled Washington, \"the Great Accommodator.\" Washington responded that confrontation could lead to disaster for the outnumbered blacks, and that cooperation with supportive whites was the only way to overcome racism in the long run.\nWhile promoting moderation, Washington contributed secretly and substantially to mounting legal challenges activist African Americans launched against segregation and disenfranchisement of blacks. In his public role, he believed he could achieve more by skillful accommodation to the social realities of the age of segregation.\nWashington's work on education helped him enlist both the moral and substantial financial support of many major white philanthropists. He became a friend of such self-made men as Standard Oil magnate Henry Huttleston Rogers; Sears, Roebuck and Company President Julius Rosenwald; and George Eastman, inventor of roll film, founder of Eastman Kodak, and developer of a major part of the photography industry. These individuals and many other wealthy men and women funded his causes, including Hampton and Tuskegee institutes.\nHe also gave lectures to raise money for the school. On January 23, 1906, he lectured at Carnegie Hall in New York in the Tuskegee Institute Silver Anniversary Lecture. He spoke along with prominent orators of the day, including Mark Twain, Joseph Hodges Choate, and Robert Curtis Ogden; it was the start of a capital campaign to raise $1,800,000 (~$ in 2024) for the school.\nThe schools which Washington supported were founded primarily to produce teachers, as education was critical for the black community following emancipation. Freedmen strongly supported literacy and education as the keys to their future. When graduates returned to their largely impoverished rural southern communities, they still found few schools and educational resources, as the white-dominated state legislatures consistently underfunded black schools in their segregated system.\nTo address those needs, in the 20th century, Washington enlisted his philanthropic network to create matching funds programs to stimulate construction of numerous rural public schools for black children in the South. Working especially with Julius Rosenwald from Chicago, Washington had Tuskegee architects develop model school designs. The Rosenwald Fund helped support the construction and operation of more than 5,000 schools and related resources for the education of blacks throughout the South in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The local schools were a source of communal pride; African-American families gave labor, land and money to them, to give their children more chances in an environment of poverty and segregation. A major part of Washington's legacy, the model rural schools continued to be constructed into the 1930s, with matching funds for communities from the Rosenwald Fund.\nWashington further contributed to the Progressive Era by forming the National Negro Business League, an organization which encouraged and supported entrepreneurship among black businessmen.\nHis autobiography \"Up from Slavery\" has been continuously widely read since its initial publication in 1901.\nMarriages and children.\nWashington was married three times. In his autobiography \"Up from Slavery\", he gave all three of his wives credit for their contributions at Tuskegee. His first wife Fannie N. Smith was from Malden, West Virginia, the same Kanawha River Valley town where Washington had lived from age nine to sixteen. He maintained ties there all his life, and Smith was a student of his when he taught in Malden. He helped her gain entrance into the Hampton Institute. Washington and Smith were married in the summer of 1882, a year after he became principal there. They had one child, Portia M. Washington, born in 1883. Fannie died in May 1884.\nIn 1885, the widower Washington married again, to Olivia A. Davidson (1854\u20131889). Born free in Virginia to a free woman of color and a father who had been freed from slavery, she moved with her family to the free state of Ohio, where she attended common schools. Davidson later studied at Hampton Institute and went North to study at the Massachusetts State Normal School at Framingham. She taught in Mississippi and Tennessee before going to Tuskegee to work as a teacher. Washington recruited Davidson to Tuskegee, and promoted her to vice-principal. They had two sons, Booker T. Washington Jr. and Ernest Davidson Washington, before she died in 1889.\nIn 1893, Washington married Margaret James Murray. She was from Mississippi and had graduated from Fisk University, a historically black college. They had no children together, but she helped rear Washington's three children. Murray outlived Washington and died in 1925.\nPolitics and the Atlanta Compromise.\nWashington's 1895 Atlanta Exhibition address was viewed as a \"revolutionary moment\" by both African Americans and whites across the country. At the time W. E. B. Du Bois supported him, but they grew apart as Du Bois sought more action to remedy disfranchisement and improve educational opportunities for blacks. After their falling out, Du Bois and his supporters referred to Washington's speech as the \"Atlanta Compromise\" to express their criticism that Washington was too accommodating to white interests.\nWashington advocated a \"go slow\" approach to avoid a harsh white backlash. He has been criticized for encouraging many youths in the South to accept sacrifices of potential political power, civil rights, and higher education. Washington believed that African Americans should \"concentrate all their energies on industrial education, and accumulation of wealth, and the conciliation of the South\". He valued the \"industrial\" education, as it provided critical skills for the jobs then available to the majority of African Americans at the time, as most lived in the South, which was overwhelmingly rural and agricultural. He thought these skills would lay the foundation for the creation of stability that the African-American community required in order to move forward. He believed that in the long term, \"blacks would eventually gain full participation in society by showing themselves to be responsible, reliable American citizens\". His approach advocated for an initial step toward equal rights, rather than full equality under the law, gaining economic power to back up black demands for political equality in the future. He believed that such achievements would prove to the deeply prejudiced white America that African Americans were not \"'naturally' stupid and incompetent\".\nWell-educated blacks in the North lived in a different society and advocated a different approach, in part due to their perception of wider opportunities. Du Bois wanted blacks to have the same \"classical\" liberal arts education as upper-class whites did, along with voting rights and civic equality. The latter two had been ostensibly granted since 1870 by constitutional amendments after the Civil War. He believed that an elite, which he called the talented tenth, would advance to lead the race to a wider variety of occupations. Du Bois and Washington were divided in part by differences in treatment of African Americans in the North versus the South; although both groups suffered discrimination, the mass of blacks in the South were far more constrained by legal segregation and disenfranchisement, which totally excluded most from the political process and system. Many in the North objected to being 'led', and authoritatively spoken for, by a Southern accommodationist strategy which they considered to have been \"imposed on them [Southern blacks] primarily by Southern whites\".\nHistorian Clarence E. Walker wrote that, for white Southerners,\nFree black people were 'matter out of place'. Their emancipation was an affront to southern white freedom. Booker T. Washington did not understand that his program was perceived as subversive of a natural order in which black people were to remain forever subordinate or unfree.\nBoth Washington and Du Bois sought to define the best means post-Civil War to improve the conditions of the African-American community through education.\nBlacks were solidly Republican in this period, having gained emancipation and suffrage with President Lincoln and his party. Fellow Republican President Ulysses S. Grant defended African Americans' newly won freedom and civil rights in the South by passing laws and using federal force to suppress the Ku Klux Klan, which had committed violence against blacks for years to suppress voting and discourage education. After Federal troops left in 1877 at the end of the Reconstruction era, many paramilitary groups worked to suppress black voting by violence. From 1890 to 1908 Southern states disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites through constitutional amendments and statutes that created barriers to voter registration and voting. Such devices as poll taxes and subjective literacy tests sharply reduced the number of blacks in voting rolls. By the late nineteenth century, Southern white Democrats defeated some biracial Populist-Republican coalitions and regained power in the state legislatures of the former Confederacy; they passed laws establishing racial segregation and Jim Crow. In the border states and North, blacks continued to exercise the vote; the well-established Maryland African-American community defeated attempts there to disfranchise them.\nWashington worked and socialized with many national white politicians and industry leaders. He developed the ability to persuade wealthy whites, many of them self-made men, to donate money to black causes by appealing to their values. He argued that the surest way for blacks to gain equal social rights was to demonstrate \"industry, thrift, intelligence and property\". He believed these were key to improved conditions for African Americans in the United States. Because African Americans had recently been emancipated and most lived in a hostile environment, Washington believed they could not expect too much at once. He said, \"I have learned that success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has had to overcome while trying to succeed.\"\nAlong with Du Bois, Washington partly organized the \"Negro exhibition\" at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris, where photos of Hampton Institute's black students were displayed. These were taken by his friend Frances Benjamin Johnston. The exhibition demonstrated African Americans' positive contributions to United States society.\nWashington privately contributed substantial funds for legal challenges to segregation and disfranchisement, such as the case of \"Giles v. Harris\", which was heard before the United States Supreme Court in 1903. Even when such challenges were won at the Supreme Court, southern states quickly responded with new laws to accomplish the same ends, for instance, adding \"grandfather clauses\" that covered white people and not black people in order to prevent black people from voting.\nWealthy friends and benefactors.\nState and local governments historically underfunded black schools, although they were ostensibly providing \"separate but equal\" segregated facilities. White philanthropists strongly supported education financially. Washington encouraged them and directed millions of their money to projects all across the South that Washington thought best reflected his self-help philosophy. Washington associated with the richest and most powerful businessmen and politicians of the era, as well as many other educational leaders, such as William Rainey Harper, president of the University of Chicago. He was seen as a spokesperson for African Americans and became a conduit for funding educational programs.\nHis contacts included such diverse and well known entrepreneurs and philanthropists as Andrew Carnegie, William Howard Taft, John D. Rockefeller, Henry Huttleston Rogers, George Eastman, Julius Rosenwald, Robert Curtis Ogden, Collis Potter Huntington and William Henry Baldwin Jr. The latter donated large sums of money to agencies such as the Jeanes and Slater Funds. As a result, countless small rural schools were established through Washington's efforts, under programs that continued many years after his death. Along with rich white men, the black communities helped their communities directly by donating time, money and labor to schools to match the funds required.\nHenry Huttleston Rogers.\nA representative case of an exceptional relationship was Washington's friendship with millionaire industrialist and financier Henry H. Rogers (1840\u20131909). Henry Rogers was a self-made man, who had risen from a modest working-class family to become a principal officer of Standard Oil, and one of the richest men in the United States. Around 1894, Rogers heard Washington speak at Madison Square Garden. The next day, he contacted Washington and requested a meeting, during which Washington later recounted that he was told that Rogers \"was surprised that no one had 'passed the hat' after the speech\". The meeting began a close relationship that extended over a period of 15 years. Although Washington and the very private Rogers were seen as friends, the true depth and scope of their relationship was not publicly revealed until after Rogers's sudden death of a stroke in May 1909. Washington was a frequent guest at Rogers's New York office, his Fairhaven, Massachusetts summer home, and aboard his steam yacht \"Kanawha\".\nA few weeks later, Washington went on a previously planned speaking tour along the newly completed Virginian Railway, a $40-million enterprise that had been built almost entirely from Rogers's personal fortune. As Washington rode in the late financier's private railroad car, \"Dixie\", he stopped and made speeches at many locations. His companions later recounted that he had been warmly welcomed by both black and white citizens at each stop.\nWashington revealed that Rogers had been quietly funding operations of 65 small country schools for African Americans, and had given substantial sums of money to support Tuskegee and Hampton institutes. He also noted that Rogers had encouraged programs with matching funds requirements so the recipients had a stake in the outcome.\nAnna T. Jeanes.\nIn 1907 Philadelphia Quaker Anna T. Jeanes (1822\u20131907) donated one million dollars to Washington for elementary schools for black children in the South. Her contributions and those of Henry Rogers and others funded schools in many poor communities.\nJulius Rosenwald.\nJulius Rosenwald (1862\u20131932) was a Jewish American self-made wealthy man with whom Washington found common ground. By 1908, Rosenwald, son of an immigrant clothier, had become part-owner and president of Sears, Roebuck and Company in Chicago. Rosenwald was a philanthropist who was deeply concerned about the poor state of African-American education, especially in the segregated Southern states, where their schools were underfunded.\nIn 1912, Rosenwald was asked to serve on the Board of Directors of Tuskegee Institute, a position he held for the remainder of his life. Rosenwald endowed Tuskegee so that Washington could spend less time fundraising and more managing the school. Later in 1912, Rosenwald provided funds to Tuskegee for a pilot program to build six new small schools in rural Alabama. They were designed, constructed and opened in 1913 and 1914, and overseen by Tuskegee architects and staff; the model proved successful.\nAfter Washington died in 1915, Rosenwald established the Rosenwald Fund in 1917, primarily to serve African-American students in rural areas throughout the South. The school building program was one of its largest programs. Using the architectural model plans developed by professors at Tuskegee Institute, the Rosenwald Fund spent over $4\u00a0million to help build 4,977 schools, 217 teachers' homes, and 163 shop buildings in 883 counties in 15 states, from Maryland to Texas. The Rosenwald Fund made matching grants, requiring community support, cooperation from the white school boards, and local fundraising. Black communities raised more than $4.7\u00a0million to aid the construction and sometimes donated land and labor; essentially they taxed themselves twice to do so. These schools became informally known as Rosenwald Schools. But the philanthropist did not want them to be named for him, as they belonged to their communities. By his death in 1932, these newer facilities could accommodate one-third of all African-American children in Southern U.S. schools.\n\"Up from Slavery\" to the White House.\nWashington's long-term adviser, Timothy Thomas Fortune (1856\u20131928), was a respected African-American economist and editor of \"The New York Age\", the most widely read newspaper in the black community within the United States. He was the ghost-writer and editor of Washington's first autobiography, \"The Story of My Life and Work\". Washington published five books during his lifetime with the aid of ghost-writers Timothy Fortune, Max Bennett Thrasher and Robert E. Park.\nThey included compilations of speeches and essays:\nIn an effort to inspire the \"commercial, agricultural, educational, and industrial advancement\" of African Americans, Washington founded the National Negro Business League (NNBL) in 1900.\nWhen Washington's second autobiography, \"Up from Slavery\", was published in 1901, it became a bestseller\u2014remaining the best-selling autobiography of an African American for over sixty years\u2014and had a major effect on the African-American community and its friends and allies.\nDinner at the White House.\nIn October 1901, President Theodore Roosevelt invited Washington to dine with him and his family at the White House. Although Republican presidents had met privately with black leaders, this was the first highly publicized social occasion when an African American was invited there on equal terms by the president. Democratic Party politicians from the South, including future governor of Mississippi James K. Vardaman and Senator Benjamin Tillman of South Carolina, indulged in racist personal attacks when they learned of the invitation. Both used the derogatory term for African Americans in their statements. The meeting was also condemned by the Democratic perennial presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan, who argued that \"the more advanced race never has consented, and probably never will consent, to be dominated by the less advanced\" despite him having previously praised Washington.\nVardaman described the White House as \"so saturated with the odor of the nigger that the rats have taken refuge in the stable,\" and declared, \"I am just as much opposed to Booker T. Washington as a voter as I am to the cocoanut-headed, chocolate-colored typical little coon who blacks my shoes every morning. Neither is fit to perform the supreme function of citizenship.\" Tillman said, \"The action of President Roosevelt in entertaining that nigger will necessitate our killing a thousand niggers in the South before they will learn their place again.\"\nLadislaus Hengelm\u00fcller von Hengerv\u00e1r, the Austro-Hungarian ambassador to the United States, who was visiting the White House on the same day, said he found a rabbit's foot in Washington's coat pocket when he mistakenly put on the coat. \"The Washington Post\" described it as \"the left hind foot of a graveyard rabbit, killed in the dark of the moon\". The \"Detroit Journal\" quipped the next day, \"The Austrian ambassador may have made off with Booker T. Washington's coat at the White House, but he'd have a bad time trying to fill his shoes.\"\nDeath.\nDespite his extensive travels and widespread work, Washington continued as principal of Tuskegee. Washington's health was deteriorating rapidly in 1915; he collapsed in New York City and was diagnosed by two different doctors as having Bright's disease, an inflammation of the kidneys, today called nephritis. Told he had only a few days left to live, Washington expressed a desire to die at Tuskegee. He boarded a train and arrived in Tuskegee shortly after midnight on November 14, 1915. He died a few hours later at the age of 59. His funeral was held on November 17, 1915, in the Tuskegee Institute Chapel. It was attended by nearly 8,000 people. He was buried nearby in the Tuskegee University Campus Cemetery.\nAt the time he was thought to have died of congestive heart failure, aggravated by overwork. In March 2006, his descendants permitted examination of medical records: these showed he had hypertension, with a blood pressure more than twice normal, and that he died of kidney failure brought on by high blood pressure.\nAt Washington's death, Tuskegee's endowment was close to $2,000,000 (). Washington's greatest life's work, the education of blacks in the South, was well underway and expanding.\nHonors and memorials.\nFor his contributions to American society, Washington was granted an honorary master's degree from Harvard University in 1896, followed by an honorary doctorate from Dartmouth College.\nAt the center of Tuskegee University, the Booker T. Washington Monument was dedicated in 1922. Called \"Lifting the Veil\", the monument has an inscription reading: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"He lifted the veil of ignorance from his people and pointed the way to progress through education and industry.\"\nIn 1934, Robert Russa Moton, Washington's successor as president of Tuskegee University, arranged an air tour for two African-American aviators. Afterward the plane was renamed as the \"Booker T. Washington\".\nOn April 7, 1940, Washington became the first African American to be depicted on a United States postage stamp.\nIn 1942, the liberty ship \"Booker T. Washington\" was named in his honor, the first major oceangoing vessel to be named after an African American. The ship was christened by noted singer Marian Anderson.\nIn 1946, he was honored on the first coin to feature an African American, the Booker T. Washington Memorial half dollar, which was minted by the United States until 1951.\nOn April 5, 1956, the hundredth anniversary of Washington's birth, the house where he was born in Franklin County, Virginia was designated as the Booker T. Washington National Monument.\nA state park in Chattanooga, Tennessee, was named in his honor, as was a bridge spanning the Hampton River adjacent to his \"alma mater\", Hampton University.\nIn 1984, Hampton University dedicated a Booker T. Washington Memorial on campus near the historic Emancipation Oak, establishing, in the words of the university, \"a relationship between one of America's great educators and social activists, and the symbol of Black achievement in education\".\nNumerous high schools, middle schools and elementary schools across the United States have been named after Booker T. Washington.\nIn 2000, West Virginia State University (WVSU; then West Va. State College), in cooperation with other organizations including the Booker T. Washington Association, established the Booker T. Washington Institute, to honor Washington's boyhood home, the old town of Malden, and Washington's ideals.\nOn October 19, 2009, WVSU dedicated a monument to Booker T. Washington. The event took place at WVSU's Booker T. Washington Park in Malden, West Virginia. The monument also honors the families of African ancestry who lived in Old Malden in the early 20th century and who knew and encouraged Washington. Special guest speakers at the event included West Virginia Governor Joe Manchin III, Malden attorney Larry L. Rowe, and the president of WVSU. Musical selections were provided by the WVSU \"Marching Swarm\".\nAt the end of the 2008 presidential election, the defeated Republican candidate Senator John McCain recalled the stir caused a century before when President Theodore Roosevelt invited Booker T. Washington to the White House. McCain noted the evident progress in the country with the election of Democratic Senator Barack Obama as the first African-American President of the United States.\nLegacy.\nBooker T. Washington was so acclaimed as a public leader that the period of his activity, from 1880 to 1915, has been called the Age of Booker T. Washington. Historiography on Washington, his character, and the value of that leadership has varied dramatically. After his death, he came under heavy criticism in the civil rights community for accommodationism to white supremacy. However, since the late 20th century, a more balanced view of his very wide range of activities has appeared. As of 2010, the most recent studies, \"defend and celebrate his accomplishments, legacy, and leadership\".\nWashington was held in high regard by business-oriented conservatives, both white and black. Historian Eric Foner argues that the freedom movement of the late nineteenth century changed directions so as to align with America's new economic and intellectual framework. Black leaders emphasized economic self-help and individual advancement into the middle class as a more fruitful strategy than political agitation. There was emphasis on education and literacy throughout the period after the Civil War. Washington's famous Atlanta speech of 1895 marked this transition, as it called on blacks to develop their farms, their industrial skills, and their entrepreneurship as the next stage in emerging from slavery.\nBy this time, Mississippi had passed a new constitution, and other Southern states were following suit, or using electoral laws to raise barriers to voter registration; they completed disenfranchisement of blacks at the turn of the 20th century to maintain white supremacy. But at the same time, Washington secretly arranged to fund numerous legal challenges to such voting restrictions and segregation, which he believed was the way they had to be attacked.\nWashington repudiated the historic abolitionist emphasis on unceasing agitation for full equality, advising blacks that it was counterproductive to fight segregation at that point. Foner concludes that Washington's strong support in the black community was rooted in its widespread realization that, given their legal and political realities, frontal assaults on white supremacy were impossible, and the best way forward was to concentrate on building up their economic and social structures inside segregated communities. Historian C. Vann Woodward in 1951 wrote of Washington, \"The businessman's gospel of free enterprise, competition, and \"laissez faire\" never had a more loyal exponent.\"\nHistorians since the late 20th century have been divided in their characterization of Washington: some describe him as a visionary capable of \"read[ing] minds with the skill of a master psychologist,\" who expertly played the political game in nineteenth-century Washington by its own rules. Others say he was a self-serving, crafty narcissist who threatened and punished those in the way of his personal interests, traveled with an entourage, and spent much time fundraising, signing autographs, and giving flowery patriotic speeches with much flag waving \u2013 acts more indicative of an artful political boss than an altruistic civil rights leader.\nPeople called Washington the \"Wizard of Tuskegee\" because of his highly developed political skills and his creation of a nationwide political machine based on the black middle class, white philanthropy, and Republican Party support. Opponents called this network the \"Tuskegee Machine\". Washington maintained control because of his ability to gain support of numerous groups, including influential whites and black business, educational and religious communities nationwide. He advised as to the use of financial donations from philanthropists and avoided antagonizing white Southerners with his accommodation to the political realities of the age of Jim Crow segregation.\nThe Tuskegee machine collapsed rapidly after Washington's death. He was the charismatic leader who held it all together, with the aid of Emmett Jay Scott. But the trustees replaced Scott, and the elaborate system fell apart. Critics in the 1920s to 1960s, especially those connected with the NAACP, ridiculed Tuskegee as a producer of a class of submissive black laborers. Since the late 20th century, historians have given much more favorable view, emphasizing the school's illustrious faculty and the progressive black movements, institutions and leaders in education, politics, architecture, medicine and other professions it produced who worked hard in communities across the United States, and indeed worldwide across the African Diaspora. Deborah Morowski points out that Tuskegee's curriculum served to help students achieve a sense of personal and collective efficacy. She concludes:\nThe social studies curriculum provided an opportunity for the uplift of African Americans at time when these opportunities were few and far between for black youth. The curriculum provided inspiration for African Americans to advance their standing in society, to change the view of southern whites toward the value of blacks, and ultimately, to advance racial equality.\nAt a time when most black Americans were poor farmers in the South and were ignored by the national black leadership, Washington's Tuskegee Institute made their needs a high priority. It lobbied for government funds and especially from philanthropies that enabled the institute to provide model farming techniques, advanced training, and organizational skills. These included Annual Negro Conferences, the Tuskegee Experiment Station, the Agricultural Short Course, the Farmers' Institutes, the Farmers' County Fairs, the Movable School, and numerous pamphlets and feature stories sent free to the South's black newspapers.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPrimary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37243", "revid": "327763", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37243", "title": "Harriet Tubman", "text": "African-American abolitionist (1822\u20131913)\nHarriet Tubman (born Araminta Ross, c.\u2009March\u00a01822 \u2013 March 10, 1913) was an American abolitionist and social activist. After escaping slavery, Tubman made some 13 missions to rescue approximately 70 enslaved people, including her family and friends, using the network of antislavery activists and safe houses known collectively as the Underground Railroad. During the American Civil War, she served as an armed scout and spy for the Union Army. In her later years, Tubman was an activist in the movement for women's suffrage.\nBorn into slavery in Dorchester County, Maryland, Tubman was beaten and whipped by enslavers as a child. Early in life, she suffered a traumatic head wound when an irate overseer threw a heavy metal weight, intending to hit another slave, but hit her instead. The injury caused dizziness, pain, and spells of hypersomnia, which occurred throughout her life. After her injury, Tubman began experiencing strange visions and vivid dreams, which she ascribed to premonitions from God. These experiences, combined with her Methodist upbringing, led her to become devoutly religious.\nIn 1849, Tubman escaped to Philadelphia, only to return to Maryland to rescue her family soon after. Slowly, one group at a time, she brought relatives with her out of the state, and eventually guided dozens of other enslaved people to freedom. Tubman (or \"Moses\", as she was called) travelled by night and in extreme secrecy, and later said she \"never lost a passenger\". After the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 was passed, she helped guide escapees farther north into British North America (Canada), and helped newly freed people find work. Tubman met John Brown in 1858, and helped him plan and recruit supporters for his 1859 raid on Harpers Ferry.\nWhen the Civil War began, Tubman worked for the Union Army, first as a cook and nurse, and then as an armed scout and spy. For her guidance of the raid at Combahee Ferry, which liberated more than 700 enslaved people, she is widely credited as the first woman to lead an armed military operation in the United States. After the war, she retired to the family home on property she had purchased in 1859 in Auburn, New York, where she cared for her aging parents. She was active in the women's suffrage movement until illness overtook her and was admitted to a home for elderly African Americans, which she had helped establish years earlier. Tubman is commonly viewed as an icon of courage and freedom.\nBirth and family.\nTubman was born Araminta \"Minty\" Ross to enslaved parents, Harriet (\"Rit\") Green and Ben Ross. Rit was enslaved by Mary Pattison Brodess (and later her son Edward). Ben was enslaved by Anthony Thompson, who became Mary Brodess's second husband, and who ran a large plantation near the Blackwater River in the Madison area of Dorchester County, Maryland.\nAs with many enslaved people in the United States, neither the exact year nor place of Tubman's birth is known. Tubman reported the year of her birth as 1825, while her death certificate lists 1815 and her gravestone lists 1820. Historian Kate Larson's 2004 biography of Tubman records the year as 1822, based on a midwife payment and several other historical documents, including her runaway advertisement. Based on Larson's work, more recent biographies have accepted March 1822 as the most likely timing of Tubman's birth.\nTubman's maternal grandmother, Modesty, arrived in the U.S. on a slave ship from Africa; no information is available about her other ancestors. As a child, Tubman was told that she seemed like an Ashanti person because of her character traits, though no evidence has been found to confirm or deny this lineage. Her mother, Rit (who may have had a white father), was a cook for the Brodess family. Her father, Ben, was a skilled woodsman who managed the timber work on Thompson's plantation. They married around 1808, and according to court records, had nine children together: Linah, Mariah Ritty, Soph, Robert, Minty (Harriet), Ben, Rachel, Henry, and Moses.\nRit struggled to keep her family together as slavery threatened to tear it apart. Edward Brodess sold three of her daughters (Linah, Mariah Ritty, and Soph), separating them from the family forever. When a trader from Georgia approached Brodess about buying Rit's youngest son, Moses, she hid him for a month, aided by other enslaved people and freedmen in the community. At one point she confronted Brodess about the sale. Finally, Brodess and \"the Georgia man\" came toward the slave quarters to seize the child, where Rit told them, \"You are after my son; but the first man that comes into my house, I will split his head open.\" Brodess backed away and abandoned the sale. Tubman's biographers agree that stories told about this event within the family influenced her belief in the possibilities of resistance.\nChildhood.\nTubman's mother was assigned to \"the big house\" and had scarce time for her own family; consequently, as a child Tubman took care of a younger brother and baby, as was typical in large families. When she was five or six years old, Brodess hired her out as a nursemaid to a woman named \"Miss Susan\". Tubman was ordered to care for the baby and rock the cradle as it slept; when the baby woke up and cried, Tubman was whipped. She later recounted a particular day when she was lashed five times before breakfast. She carried the scars for the rest of her life. She found ways to resist, such as running away for five days, wearing layers of clothing as protection against beatings, and fighting back.\nAlso in her childhood, Tubman was sent to work for a planter named James Cook. She had to check his muskrat traps in nearby marshes, even after contracting measles. She became so ill that Cook sent her back to Brodess, where her mother nursed her back to health. Brodess then hired her out again. She spoke later of her acute childhood homesickness, comparing herself to \"the boy on the Swanee River\", an allusion to Stephen Foster's song \"Old Folks at Home\". As she grew older and stronger, she was assigned to field and forest work, driving oxen, plowing, and hauling logs.\nAs an adolescent, Tubman suffered a severe head injury when involved in an altercation between an overseer and a male slave who had absconded from work without permission and had gone to the store. While Tubman and others tried to defend the man from the overseer, the overseer threw a metal weight at the slave. The weight struck Tubman instead, which she said \"broke my skull\". Bleeding and unconscious, she was returned to her enslaver's house and laid on the seat of a loom, where she remained without medical care for two days. Afterwards Tubman's mother was allowed to tend to her. Tubman remained in a comatose state for weeks after the incident.\nAfter the incident Tubman frequently experienced extremely painful headaches. She also began having seizures and would seemingly fall unconscious, although she claimed to be aware of her surroundings while appearing to be asleep. Larson suggests she may have had temporal lobe epilepsy, possibly as a result of brain injury; Clinton suggests her condition may have been narcolepsy or cataplexy. A definitive diagnosis is not possible due to lack of contemporary medical evidence, but this condition remained with her for the rest of her life.\nAfter her injury, Tubman began experiencing visions and vivid dreams, which she interpreted as revelations from God. These spiritual experiences had a profound effect on Tubman's personality and she acquired a passionate faith in God. Although Tubman was illiterate, she was told Bible stories by her mother and likely attended a Methodist church with her family. Mystical inspiration guided her actions. She rejected the teachings of white preachers who urged enslaved people to be passive and obedient victims to those who trafficked and enslaved them; instead she found guidance in the Old Testament tales of deliverance. This religious perspective informed her actions throughout her life.\nFamily and first husband.\nAnthony Thompson promised to manumit Tubman's father at age\u00a045. After Thompson died, his son followed through with that promise in 1840. Tubman's father continued working as a timber estimator and foreman for the Thompson family. Later in the 1840s, Tubman paid a white attorney five dollars () to investigate the legal status of her mother, Rit. The lawyer discovered that Atthow Pattison, the grandfather of Mary Brodess, indicated in his will that Rit and any of her children would be manumitted at age\u00a045, and that any children born after she reached age\u00a045 would be freeborn. The Pattison and Brodess families ignored this stipulation when they inherited the enslaved family, but taking legal action to enforce it was an impossible task for Tubman.\nAround 1844, she married John Tubman, a free black man. Although little is known about him or their time together, the union was complicated because of her enslaved status. The mother's status dictated that of children, and any children born to Harriet and John would be enslaved. Such blended marriages\u00a0\u2013 free people of color marrying enslaved people\u00a0\u2013 were not uncommon on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, where by this time, half the black population was free. Most African-American families had both free and enslaved members. Larson suggests that they might have planned to buy Tubman's freedom.\nTubman changed her name from Araminta to Harriet soon after her marriage, though the exact timing is unclear. Larson suggests this happened right after the wedding, and Clinton suggests that it coincided with Tubman's plans to escape from slavery. She adopted her mother's name, possibly as part of a religious conversion, or to honor another relative.\nEscape from slavery.\nIn 1849, Tubman became ill again, which diminished her value to slave traders. Edward Brodess tried to sell her, but could not find a buyer. Angry at him for trying to sell her and for continuing to enslave her relatives, Tubman began to pray for God to make Brodess change his ways. She said later: \"I prayed all night long for my master till the first of March; and all the time he was bringing people to look at me, and trying to sell me.\" When it appeared as though a sale was being concluded, Tubman changed her prayer: \"First of March I began to pray, 'Oh Lord, if you ain't never going to change that man's heart, kill him, Lord, and take him out of the way'.\" A week later, Brodess died, and Tubman expressed regret for her earlier sentiments.\nAs in many estate settlements, Brodess's death increased the likelihood that Tubman would be sold and her family broken apart. His widow, Eliza, began working to sell the family's enslaved people. Tubman refused to wait for the Brodess family to decide her fate, despite her husband's efforts to dissuade her. She later said that \"there was one of two things I had a right to, liberty or death; if I could not have one, I would have the other\".\nTubman and her brothers, Ben and Henry, escaped from slavery on September 17, 1849. Tubman had been hired out to Anthony Thompson (the son of her father's former owner), who owned a large plantation in an area called Poplar Neck in neighboring Caroline County; it is likely her brothers labored for Thompson as well. Because they were hired out, Eliza Brodess probably did not recognize their absence as an escape attempt for some time. Two weeks later, she posted a runaway notice in the Cambridge \"Democrat\", offering a reward of up to US$100\u00a0each () for their capture and return to slavery. Once they had left, Tubman's brothers had second thoughts. Ben may have regretted leaving his wife and children. The two men went back, forcing Tubman to return with them.\nSometime in October or November, Tubman escaped again, this time without her brothers. Before leaving she sang a farewell song to hint at her intentions, which she hoped would be understood by Mary, a trusted fellow slave: \"I'll meet you in the morning\", she intoned, \"I'm bound for the promised land.\" While her exact route is unknown, Tubman made use of the network known as the Underground Railroad. This informal system was composed of free and enslaved black people, white abolitionists, and other activists. Most prominent among the latter in Maryland at the time were Quakers (members of the Religious Society of Friends). The Preston area near Poplar Neck contained a substantial Quaker community and was probably an important first stop during Tubman's escape. From there, she probably took a common route for people fleeing slavery\u00a0\u2013 northeast along the Choptank River, through Delaware, and then north into Pennsylvania. A journey of nearly by foot would have taken between five days and three weeks.\nTubman had to travel by night, guided by the North Star and trying to avoid slave catchers eager to collect rewards for fugitive slaves. The \"conductors\" in the Underground Railroad used deceptions for protection. At an early stop, the lady of the house instructed Tubman to sweep the yard so as to seem to be working for the family. When night fell, the family hid her in a cart and took her to the next friendly house. Given her familiarity with the woods and marshes of the region, Tubman likely hid in these locales during the day. The particulars of her first journey are unknown; because other escapees from slavery used the routes, Tubman did not discuss them until later in life. She crossed into Pennsylvania with a feeling of relief and awe, and recalled the experience years later:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When I found I had crossed that line, I looked at my hands to see if I was the same person. There was such a glory over everything; the sun came like gold through the trees, and over the fields, and I felt like I was in Heaven.\nNicknamed \"Moses\".\nAfter reaching Philadelphia, Tubman thought of her family. \"I was a stranger in a strange land,\" she said later. \"[M]y father, my mother, my brothers, and sisters, and friends were [in Maryland]. But I was free, and \"they\" should be free.\" While Tubman saved money from working odd jobs in Philadelphia and Cape May, New Jersey, the U.S. Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which forced law enforcement officials to assist in the capture of escaped slaves\u00a0\u2013 even in states that had outlawed slavery\u00a0\u2013 and heavily punished abetting escape. The law increased risks for those who had escaped slavery, more of whom therefore sought refuge in Southern Ontario, where slavery had been abolished. Racial tensions were also increasing in Philadelphia as poor Irish immigrants competed with free blacks for work.\nIn December 1850, Tubman was warned that her niece Kessiah and Kessiah's children would soon be sold in Cambridge, Maryland. Tubman went to Baltimore, where her brother-in-law Tom Tubman hid her until the sale. Kessiah's husband, a free black man named John Bowley, made the winning bid for his wife. While the auctioneer stepped away to have lunch, John, Kessiah and their children escaped to a nearby safe house. When night fell, Bowley sailed the family on a log canoe to Baltimore, where they met with Tubman, who brought the family to Philadelphia.\nEarly next year she returned to Maryland to guide away other family members. During her second trip, she recovered her youngest brother, Moses, along with two other men. Word of her exploits had encouraged her family, and she became more confident with each trip to Maryland.\nIn late 1851, Tubman returned to Dorchester County for the first time since her escape, this time to find her husband John. When she arrived there, she learned that John had married another woman named Caroline. Tubman sent word that he should join her, but he insisted that he was happy where he was. Suppressing her anger, she found some enslaved people who wanted to escape and led them to Philadelphia.\nBecause the Fugitive Slave Law had made the northern United States a more dangerous place for those escaping slavery to remain, many escapees began migrating to Southern Ontario. In December\u00a01851, Tubman guided an unidentified group of 11\u00a0escapees, possibly including the Bowleys and several others she had helped rescue earlier, northward. There is evidence to suggest that Tubman and her group stopped at the home of abolitionist and former slave Frederick Douglass. Douglass and Tubman admired one another greatly as they both struggled against slavery. Years later he contrasted his efforts with hers, writing:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Most that I have done and suffered in the service of our cause has been in public, and I have received much encouragement at every step of the way. You, on the other hand, have labored in a private way. I have wrought in the day \u2013 you in the night.\u00a0... The midnight sky and the silent stars have been the witnesses of your devotion to freedom and of your heroism. Excepting John Brown \u2013 of sacred memory \u2013 I know of no one who has willingly encountered more perils and hardships to serve our enslaved people than you have.\nFrom 1851 to 1862, Tubman returned repeatedly to the Eastern Shore of Maryland, rescuing some 70\u00a0slaves in about 13\u00a0expeditions, including her other brothers, Henry, Ben, and Robert, their wives and some of their children. She also provided specific instructions to 50 to 60\u00a0additional enslaved people who escaped. Because of her efforts, she was nicknamed \"Moses\", alluding to the biblical prophet who led the Hebrews to freedom from Egypt. One of her last missions into Maryland was to retrieve her aging parents. Her father purchased her mother from Eliza Brodess in 1855, but even when they were both free, the area was hostile. In 1857, Tubman received word that her father was at risk of arrest for harboring a group of eight people escaping slavery. She led her parents north to St. Catharines, Canada, where a community of formerly enslaved people, including other relatives and friends of Tubman, had gathered.\nRoutes and methods.\nTubman's dangerous work required ingenuity. She usually worked during winter, when long nights and cold weather minimized the chance of being seen. She would start the escapes on Saturday evenings, since newspapers would not print runaway notices until Monday morning. She used subterfuges to avoid detection. Tubman once disguised herself with a bonnet and carried two live chickens to give the appearance of running errands. Suddenly finding herself walking toward a former enslaver, she yanked the strings holding the birds' legs, and their agitation allowed her to avoid eye contact. Later she recognized a fellow train passenger as a former enslaver; she snatched a nearby newspaper and pretended to read. Tubman was known to be illiterate, and the man ignored her.\nIn an 1897 interview with historian Wilbur Siebert, Tubman named some people who helped her and places she stayed along the Underground Railroad. She stayed with Sam Green, a free black minister living in East New Market, Maryland; she also hid near her parents' home at Poplar Neck. She would travel from there northeast to Sandtown and Willow Grove, Delaware, and to the Camden area where free black agents, William and Nat Brinkley and Abraham Gibbs, guided her north past Dover, Smyrna, and Blackbird, where other agents would take her across the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal to New Castle and Wilmington. In Wilmington, Quaker Thomas Garrett would secure transportation to William Still's office or the homes of other Underground Railroad operators in the greater Philadelphia area. Still is credited with helping hundreds escape to safer places in New York, New England, and Southern Ontario.\nTubman's faith was another important resource as she ventured repeatedly into Maryland. The visions from her childhood head injury continued, and she saw them as divine premonitions. She spoke of \"consulting with God\", and trusted that He would keep her safe. Garrett once said of her, \"I never met with any person of any color who had more confidence in the voice of God, as spoken direct to her soul.\" Her faith also provided immediate assistance. She used spirituals as coded messages, warning fellow travelers of danger or to signal a clear path. She sang versions of \"Go Down Moses\" and changed the lyrics to indicate that it was either safe or too dangerous to proceed. As she led escapees across the border, she would call out, \"Glory to God and Jesus, too. One more soul is safe!\" In a dictated letter to a friend, she said, \"God set the North Star in the heavens; He gave me the strength in my limbs; He meant I should be free.\"\nShe carried a revolver as protection from slave catchers and their dogs. Tubman also threatened to shoot anyone who tried to turn back since that would risk the safety of the remaining group, as well as anyone who helped them on the way. Tubman spoke of one man who insisted he was going to go back to the plantation. She pointed the gun at his head and said, \"Go on or die.\" Several days later, the man who wavered crossed into Canada with the rest of the group.\nBy the late 1850s, Eastern Shore slaveholders were holding public meetings about the large number of escapes in the area; they cast suspicion on free blacks and white abolitionists. They did not know that \"Minty\", the petite, disabled woman who had run away years before, was responsible for freeing so many enslaved people. Though a popular legend persists about a reward of $40,000 () for Tubman's capture, this is a manufactured figure: in 1867, in support of Tubman's claim for a military pension, an abolitionist named Sallie Holley wrote that $40,000 \"was not too great a reward for Maryland slaveholders to offer for her\". If it were real, such a high reward would have garnered national attention. A reward of $12,000 has also been claimed, though no documentation has been found for either figure.\nTubman and the fugitives she assisted were never captured. Years later, she told an audience: \"I was conductor of the Underground Railroad for eight years, and I can say what most conductors can't say\u00a0\u2013 I never ran my train off the track and I never lost a passenger.\"\nJohn Brown and Harpers Ferry.\nIn April\u00a01858, Tubman was introduced to the abolitionist John Brown, an insurgent who advocated the use of violence to destroy slavery in the United States. Although she was not previously involved in armed insurrection, she agreed with his course of direct action and supported his goals. Like Tubman, he spoke of being called by God, and trusted the divine to protect him from the wrath of slavers. She, meanwhile, claimed to have had a prophetic vision of meeting Brown before their encounter.\nThus, as he began recruiting supporters for an attack on slaveholders, Brown was joined by \"General Tubman\", as he called her. Her knowledge of support networks and resources in the border states of Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware was invaluable to Brown and his planners. Although other abolitionists like Douglass did not endorse his tactics, Brown dreamed of fighting to create a new state for those freed from slavery, and made preparations for military action. He believed that after he began the first battle, the enslaved would rise up and carry out a rebellion across the slave states. He asked Tubman to gather former slaves then living in Southern Ontario who might be willing to join his fighting force, which she did.\nOn May 8, 1858, Brown held a meeting in Chatham, Canada, where he unveiled his plan for a raid on Harpers Ferry, Virginia. When word of the plan was leaked to the government, Brown put the scheme on hold and began raising funds for its eventual resumption. Tubman aided him in this effort and with more detailed plans for the assault.\nTubman was busy during this time, giving talks to abolitionist audiences and tending to her relatives. In early October 1859, as Brown and his men prepared to launch the attack, Tubman was ill in New Bedford, Massachusetts. It is not known whether she still intended to join Brown's raid or if she had become skeptical of the plan, but when the raid on Harpers Ferry took place on October\u00a016, Tubman had recovered from her illness and was in New York City.\nThe raid failed; Brown was convicted of treason, murder, and inciting a rebellion, and he was hanged on December\u00a02. His actions were seen by many abolitionists as a symbol of proud resistance, carried out by a noble martyr. Tubman herself was effusive with praise. She later told a friend: \"[H]e done more in dying, than 100\u00a0men would in living.\"\nAuburn and Margaret.\nIn early 1859, Frances Adeline Seward, the wife of abolitionist Republican U.S. Senator William H. Seward, sold Tubman a farm in Fleming, New York, for $1,200 (). The adjacent city of Auburn was a hotbed of antislavery activism, and Tubman took the opportunity to move her parents from Canada back to the U.S. Her farmstead became a haven for Tubman's family and friends. For years, she took in relatives and boarders, offering a safe place for black Americans seeking a better life in the north.\nShortly after acquiring the farm, Tubman went back to Maryland and returned with an eight-year-old light-skinned black girl named Margaret, who Tubman said was her niece. She also indicated the girl's parents were free blacks. According to Margaret's daughter Alice, Margaret later described her childhood home as prosperous and said that she left behind a twin brother. These descriptions conflict with what is known about the families of Tubman's siblings, which created uncertainty among historians about the relationship and Tubman's motivations. Alice called Tubman's actions a \"kidnapping\", saying, \"she had taken the child from a sheltered good home to a place where there was nobody to care for her\". After speculating in her 2004 biography of Tubman that Margaret might have been Tubman's own secret daughter, Kate Larson found evidence that Margaret was the daughter of Isaac and Mary Woolford, a free black couple who were neighbors of Tubman's parents in Maryland and who had twins named James and Margaret.\nIn November\u00a01860, Tubman conducted her last rescue mission. Throughout the 1850s, Tubman had been unable to effect the escape of her sister Rachel, and Rachel's two children Ben and Angerine. Upon returning to Dorchester County, Tubman discovered that Rachel had died, and the children could be rescued only if she could pay a bribe of $30 (). She did not have the money, so the children remained enslaved. Their fates remain unknown. Never one to waste a trip, Tubman gathered another group, including the Ennalls family, ready and willing to take the risks of the journey north. It took them weeks to get away safely because of slave catchers forcing them to hide out longer than expected. The weather was unseasonably cold and they had little food. The Ennalls' infant child was quieted with paregoric while slave patrols rode by. They safely reached the home of David and Martha Wright in Auburn on December 28, 1860.\nAmerican Civil War.\nWhen the Civil War broke out in 1861, Tubman had a vision that the war would soon lead to the abolition of slavery. More immediately, enslaved people near Union positions began escaping in large numbers. General Benjamin Butler declared these escapees to be \"contraband\"\u00a0\u2013 property seized by northern forces\u00a0\u2013 and put them to work, initially without pay, at Fort Monroe in Virginia. The number of \"contrabands\" encamped at Fort Monroe and other Union positions rapidly increased. In January 1862, Tubman volunteered to support the Union cause and began helping refugees in the camps, particularly in Port Royal, South Carolina.\nIn South Carolina, Tubman met General David Hunter, a strong supporter of abolition. He declared all of the \"contrabands\" in the Port Royal district free, and began gathering formerly enslaved people for a regiment of black soldiers. U.S. President Abraham Lincoln was not yet prepared to enforce emancipation on the southern states and reprimanded Hunter for his actions. Tubman condemned Lincoln's response and his general unwillingness to consider ending slavery in the U.S., for both moral and practical reasons:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;God won't let master Lincoln beat the South till he does \"the right thing\". Master Lincoln, he's a great man, and I am a poor negro; but the negro can tell master Lincoln how to save the money and the young men. He can do it by setting the negro free.\nTubman served as a nurse in Port Royal, preparing remedies from local plants and aiding soldiers suffering from dysentery and infectious diseases. At first, she received government rations for her work, but to dispel a perception that she was getting special treatment, she gave up her right to these supplies and made money selling pies and root beer, which she made in the evenings.\nScouting and the Combahee River Raid.\nWhen Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, Tubman considered it a positive but incomplete step toward the goal of liberating all black people from slavery. She turned her own efforts towards more direct actions to defeat the Confederacy. In early 1863, Tubman used her knowledge of covert travel and subterfuge to lead a band of scouts through the land around Port Royal. Her group, working under the orders of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, mapped the unfamiliar terrain and reconnoitered its inhabitants. She later worked alongside Colonel James Montgomery and provided him with intelligence that aided in the temporary capture of Jacksonville, Florida, in March 1863.\nLater that year, Tubman's intelligence gathering played a key role in the raid at Combahee Ferry. She guided three steamboats with black soldiers under Montgomery's command past mines on the Combahee River to assault several plantations. Once ashore, the Union troops set fire to the plantations, destroying infrastructure and seizing thousands of dollars' worth of food and supplies. Forewarned of the raid by Tubman's spy network, enslaved people throughout the area heard steamboats' whistles and understood that they were being liberated. Tubman went ashore to assist them onto the boats, ruining her dress in the process, and she sang lyrics from \"Uncle Sam's Farm\" encouraging them to \"come along, come along\". She later described a scene of chaos with women carrying still-steaming pots of rice, pigs squealing in bags slung over shoulders, and babies hanging around their parents' necks. Armed overseers tried to stop the mass escape, but their efforts were nearly useless in the tumult. As Confederate troops raced to the scene, the steamboats took off toward Beaufort with more than 750\u00a0formerly enslaved people.\nNewspapers heralded Tubman's \"patriotism, sagacity, energy, [and] ability\" in the raid, and she was praised for her recruiting efforts\u00a0\u2013 more than 100 of the newly liberated men joined the Union army. Reports about her involvement in the raid led to a revival of the \"General Tubman\" appellation previously given to her by John Brown. Although her contributions have sometimes been exaggerated, her role in the raid led to her being widely credited as the first woman to lead U.S. troops in an armed assault.\nIn July 1863, Tubman worked with Colonel Robert Gould Shaw at the assault on Fort Wagner, reportedly serving him his last meal. She later described the battle to historian Albert Bushnell Hart:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And then we saw the lightning, and that was the guns; and then we heard the thunder, and that was the big guns; and then we heard the rain falling, and that was the drops of blood falling; and when we came to get the crops, it was dead men that we reaped.\nFor two more years, Tubman worked for the Union forces, tending to newly liberated people, scouting into Confederate territory, and nursing wounded soldiers in Virginia, a task she continued for several months after the Confederacy surrendered in April\u00a01865.\nLater life.\nTubman had received little pay for her Union military service. She was not a regular soldier and was only occasionally compensated for her work as a spy and scout; her work as a nurse was entirely unpaid. For over three years of service, she received a total of $200 (). Her unofficial status caused great difficulty in documenting her service, and the U.S. government was slow to recognize any debt to her. Meanwhile, her humanitarian work for her family and the formerly enslaved kept her in a state of constant poverty.\nWhen a promised appointment to an official military nursing position fell through in July 1865, Tubman decided to return to her home in New York. During a train ride to New York in October 1865, Tubman traveled on a half-fare ticket provided to her because of her service. A conductor told her to move from a regular passenger car into the less-desirable smoking car. When she refused, he cursed at her and grabbed her. She resisted, and he summoned additional men for help. They muscled her into the smoking car, injuring her in the process. As these events transpired, white passengers cursed Tubman and told the conductor to kick her off the train.\nTubman spent her remaining years in Auburn, tending to her family and other people in need. In addition to managing her farm, she took in boarders and worked various jobs to pay the bills and support her elderly parents. One of the people Tubman took in was a farmer named Nelson Davis. Born enslaved in North Carolina, he had served as a private in the 8th United States Colored Infantry Regiment from September\u00a01863 to November\u00a01865. He began working in Auburn as a bricklayer, and they soon fell in love. Though he was 22\u00a0years younger than she was, on March 18, 1869, they were married at the Central Presbyterian Church. They adopted a baby girl named Gertie in 1874.\nTubman's friends and supporters from the days of abolition, meanwhile, raised funds to support her. One admirer, Sarah Hopkins Bradford, wrote an authorized biography entitled \"Scenes in the Life of Harriet Tubman\". The 132-page volume was published in 1869 and brought Tubman some $1,200 in income (). Even with this assistance, paying off the mortgage on her farm in May 1873 exhausted Tubman's savings. That October, she fell prey to swindlers. Two black men claimed to know a former slave who had a trunk of gold coins smuggled out of South Carolina, which they would sell for cash at less than half the coins' value. She knew white people in the South had buried valuables when Union forces threatened the region, and black men were frequently assigned to digging duties, so the claim seemed plausible to her. She borrowed money from a wealthy friend and arranged to receive the gold late one night. Once the men had lured her into the woods, they knocked her out with chloroform and stole her purse. Tubman was found dazed and injured; the trunk was filled with rocks.\nThe crime brought new attention from local leaders to Tubman's precarious financial state and spurred renewed efforts to get compensation for her Civil War service. In 1874, Representatives Clinton D. MacDougall of New York and Gerry W. Hazelton of Wisconsin introduced a bill to pay Tubman a $2,000 () lump sum \"for services rendered by her to the Union Army as scout, nurse, and spy\", but it was defeated in the Senate. In February 1880, Tubman's wood-framed house burned down, but with the help of her supporters it was quickly replaced with a new brick home.\nNelson Davis died of tuberculosis on October 14, 1888. The Dependent and Disability Pension Act of 1890 made Tubman eligible for a pension as his widow. After she documented her marriage and her husband's service record to the satisfaction of the Bureau of Pensions, in 1895 Tubman was granted a monthly widow's pension of $8 (), plus a lump sum of $500 to cover the five-year delay in approval. In December\u00a01897, New York Congressman Sereno E. Payne introduced a bill to grant Tubman a soldier's monthly pension of $25 (). Although Congress received documents and letters to support Tubman's claims, some members objected to a woman being paid a full soldier's pension. In February\u00a01899, Congress approved a compromise amount of $20 () per month (the $8 from her widow's pension plus $12 for her service as a nurse), but did not acknowledge her as a scout and spy.\nSuffragist activism.\nIn her later years, Tubman worked to promote the cause of women's suffrage. A white woman once asked Tubman whether she believed women ought to have the vote, and received the reply: \"I suffered enough to believe it.\" Tubman began attending meetings of suffragist organizations, and was soon working alongside women such as Susan B. Anthony and Emily Howland.\nTubman traveled to New York, Boston and Washington, D.C., to speak in favor of women's voting rights. She described her actions during and after the Civil War, and used the sacrifices of countless women throughout modern history as evidence of women's equality to men. When the National Federation of Afro-American Women was founded, Tubman was the keynote speaker at its first conference in 1896. When the Federation was merged into the National Association of Colored Women, Tubman attended that organization's second conference in 1899.\nThis wave of activism kindled a new wave of admiration for Tubman among the press in the United States. A publication called \"The Woman's Era\" launched a series of articles on \"Eminent Women\" with a profile of Tubman. An 1897 suffragist newspaper reported a series of receptions in Boston honoring Tubman and her lifetime of service to the nation. However, her endless contributions to others had left her in poverty, and she had to sell a cow to buy a train ticket to these celebrations.\nChurch, illness, and death.\nIn the 1870s, Tubman became active in the Thompson Memorial African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Zion Church in Auburn. In 1895, she began discussions with AME Zion leaders and others to create a Harriet Tubman Home for the Aged that would care for \"indigent colored people\". Despite her financial limitations, in 1896 Tubman bid $1215 () at auction for a farm adjacent to the one she already owned, to use for the new facility. She designated one of the farm's buildings as its primary residence and named it \"John Brown Hall\" to honor her late abolitionist ally. However, raising funds for the project was difficult, and attempts to donate the property were complicated by the multiple mortgage loans used to pay for it. After Tubman almost lost the property because of her financial difficulties, AME Zion agreed to take it over in 1903.\nThe home did not open for another five years, and Tubman was dismayed when the church ordered residents to pay a $100\u00a0entrance fee (). She said: \"[T]hey make a rule that nobody should come in without they have a hundred dollars. Now I wanted to make a rule that nobody should come in unless they didn't have no money at all.\" She was frustrated by the new rule but was the guest of honor nonetheless when the home celebrated its opening on June 23, 1908.\nAs Tubman aged, her childhood head trauma continued to trouble her. Unable to sleep because of pain and \"buzzing\" in her head, in the late 1890s she asked a doctor at Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital to operate. In her words, he \"sawed open my skull, and raised it up, and now it feels more comfortable\". She reportedly received no anesthesia and instead bit down on a bullet, as she had seen Civil War soldiers do when their limbs were amputated.\nBy 1911, Tubman's body was so frail that she was admitted into the rest home named in her honor. A New York newspaper described her as \"ill and penniless\", prompting supporters to offer a new round of donations. Surrounded by friends and family members, she died of pneumonia on March 10, 1913. Just before she died, she quoted the Gospel of John to those in the room: \"I go away to prepare a place for you.\" Tubman was buried with semi-military honors at Fort Hill Cemetery in Auburn.\nLegacy.\nWidely known and well-respected while she was alive, Tubman became an American icon in the years after she died. By the 1980s, Tubman had become one of American history's most famous figures. She inspired generations of African Americans struggling for equality and civil rights; she was praised by leaders across the political spectrum.\nParks, monuments, and historical sites.\nNational parks and national monuments related to Tubman in the United States are the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument and the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Historical Park, both in Maryland, and the Harriet Tubman National Historical Park in Auburn. The Salem Chapel in St. Catharines, Canada where Tubman worshipped, is a National Historic Site of Canada.\nThe city of Auburn, New York, has several historical sites related to Tubman, including her gravesite. Other state and local historical sites about Tubman include the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad State Park and the Harriet Tubman Memorial Garden in Maryland, and the Harriet Tubman Museum is in New Jersey.\nArtistic portrayals.\nTubman is the subject of many works of art. Musicians including Woody Guthrie, Wynton Marsalis, and Walter Robinson have written songs celebrating her. She is the subject of operas by Thea Musgrave, Nkeiru Okoye, and Hilda Paredes, as well as plays by Carolyn Gage and a collaboration of May Miller and Willis Richardson. Tubman is the focus of novels by Elizabeth Cobbs, Marcy Heidish, Anne Parrish, and Bob the Drag Queen, and is a character in novels by Terry Bisson, Ta-Nehisi Coates, and James McBride.\nSince Tubman's life was first dramatized on television in a 1963 episode of the series \"The Great Adventure\", she has been portrayed in TV productions such as \"The Good Lord Bird\", \"Timeless\", \"Underground\", and \"A Woman Called Moses\". Cynthia Erivo received an Academy Award nomination for portraying Tubman in the 2019 biographical film \"Harriet\".\nArtists including Fern Cunningham, Jane DeDecker, Nina Cooke John, and Alison Saar have presented Tubman in sculptures. She has been drawn or painted by numerous artists, including Romare Bearden, Aaron Douglas, William Johnson, Jacob Lawrence, and Faith Ringgold.\nOther honors and commemorations.\nIn 1978, Tubman became the first African-American woman honored on a U.S. postage stamp; she appeared on a second stamp in 1995. Since 2016, there have been plans to add a portrait of Tubman to the front of the twenty-dollar bill, moving the portrait of President Andrew Jackson, a slaveholder, to the back of the bill. In 2024, the United States Mint issued three Harriet Tubman commemorative coins; each coin depicts her at a different stage of her life.\nDozens of schools, streets and highways, church groups, social organizations, and government agencies have been named after Tubman. In 1944, the United States Maritime Commission launched the , its first Liberty ship named for a black woman.\nOn November 11, 2024, Tubman was posthumously commissioned as a one-star general in the Maryland National Guard in recognition of her military service during the Civil War.\nHistoriography.\nTubman hoped to become literate and write her own memoirs, but she never did. Instead, she authorized Sarah Hopkins Bradford to combine Tubman's personal recollections, journalistic accounts, and letters from Tubman's friends and supporters to create \"Scenes in the Life of Harriet Tubman\" in 1868. Criticized by modern biographers for its artistic license and highly subjective point of view, the book nevertheless provides insight into Tubman's own view of her experiences. In 1886, at Tubman's request, Bradford released a re-written volume called \"Harriet, the Moses of her People\". In both volumes Harriet Tubman is hailed as a latter-day Joan of Arc. The revision took a more moralistic and literary tone than the prior work, changed of many event descriptions from first to third person, and rearranged depictions of events in chronological order. A final revision in 1901 added an appendix with more stories about Tubman's life. \nThe first full biography of Tubman to be published after Bradford's was Earl Conrad's \"Harriet Tubman\" (1943). Conrad experienced great difficulty in finding a publisher\u00a0\u2013 the search took four years\u00a0\u2013 and endured disdain and contempt for his efforts to construct a more objective, detailed account of Tubman's life for adults. Several highly dramatized versions of Tubman's life had been written for children, and many more came later, but Conrad wrote in an academic style. Though she was a popular historical figure, another book-length biography based on original scholarship did not appear for 60 years, when Jean Humez published a close reading of Tubman's life stories in 2003. Larson and Clinton both published their biographies soon after in 2004. Historian Milton Sernett's 2007 book \"Harriet Tubman: Myth, Memory, and History\" discusses the major biographies of Tubman up to that time.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Radiation emitted by radionuclides is almost always ionizing radiation because it is energetic enough to liberate an electron from another atom. \nRadioactive decay is a random process at the level of single atoms: it is impossible to predict when one particular atom will decay. However, for a collection of atoms of a single nuclide, the decay rate (considered as a statistical average), and thus the half-life (\"t\"1/2) for that nuclide, can be calculated from the measurement of the decay. The range of the half-lives of radioactive atoms has no known limits and spans a time range of over 55 orders of magnitude.\nAll the chemical elements have radionuclides - even the lightest element, hydrogen, has one well-known radionuclide, tritium (though helium, lithium, and boron have none with half-life over a second). Elements heavier than lead (\"Z\" &gt; 82), and the elements technetium and promethium, have only radionuclides and do not exist in stable forms, though bismuth can be treated as stable with the half-life of its natural isotope being over a trillion times longer than the current age of the universe.\nProduction and effects.\nArtificial production methods of radionuclides include neutron sources such as nuclear reactors, as well as particle accelerators such as cyclotrons.\nExposure to radionuclides generally has, due to their radiation, a harmful effect on organisms including humans, although low levels of exposure occur naturally. The degree of harm will depend on the nature and extent of the radiation produced (alpha, beta, gamma, or neutron), the amount and nature of exposure (close contact, inhalation or ingestion), and the biochemical properties of the element (toxicity). Increased risk of cancer is considered unavoidable, and worse cases experience radiation-induced cancer, chronic radiation syndrome or acute radiation syndrome. Radionuclides are weaponized by the fallout effects of nuclear weapons and by radiological weapons.\nRadionuclides with suitable properties are used in nuclear medicine for both diagnosis and treatment. An imaging tracer made with radionuclides is called a radioactive tracer. Radionuclide therapy is a form of radiotherapy. A pharmaceutical drug made with radionuclides is called a radiopharmaceutical.\nOverview.\nRadionuclides occur naturally and are artificially produced in nuclear reactors, cyclotrons, particle accelerators or radionuclide generators. There are 735 known radionuclides with half-lives longer than an hour (see list of nuclides); 35 of those are primordial radionuclides whose presence on Earth has persisted from its formation, and another 62 are detectable in nature, continuously produced either as daughter products of primordial radionuclides or by cosmic radiation. More than 2400 radionuclides have half-lives less than 60 minutes. Most of those are only produced artificially, and have very short half-lives. For comparison, there are 251 stable nuclides. \nNatural.\nOn Earth, naturally occurring radionuclides fall into three categories: primordial radionuclides, secondary radionuclides, and cosmogenic radionuclides. \nMany of these radionuclides exist only in trace amounts in nature, including all cosmogenic nuclides. Secondary radionuclides in a decay chain will occur in proportion to their half-lives, so short-lived ones will be very rare. For example, polonium can be found in uranium ores at a concentration about 1 part 1010 of uranium (0.1\u00a0mg per metric ton) by calculating the ratio of half-lives of polonium-210 to uranium-238, its ultimate parent.\nNuclear fission.\nRadionuclides are produced as an unavoidable result of nuclear fission and nuclear explosions. The process of nuclear fission creates a wide range of fission products, most of which are radionuclides. Further radionuclides are created from irradiation of the nuclear fuel (creating a range of actinides) and of the surrounding structures, yielding activation products. This complex mixture of radionuclides with different chemistries and radioactivity makes handling nuclear waste and dealing with nuclear fallout particularly problematic.\nSynthetic.\nSynthetic radionuclides are created in nuclear reactors or by particle accelerators (not necesssarily on purpose) or as decay products of such:\nUses.\nRadionuclides are used in two major ways: either for their radiation alone (irradiation, nuclear batteries) or for the combination of chemical properties and their radiation (tracers, biopharmaceuticals). For scientific study they may be used for their chemical properties alone when there is no stable form of that element.\nExamples.\nThe following table lists properties of selected radionuclides illustrating the range of properties and uses.\nKey: \"Z\"\u00a0=\u00a0atomic number; \"N\"\u00a0=\u00a0neutron number; DM\u00a0=\u00a0decay mode; DE\u00a0=\u00a0decay energy; EC\u00a0=\u00a0electron capture\nHousehold smoke detectors.\nRadionuclides are present in many homes as they are used inside the most common household smoke detectors. The radionuclide used is americium-241, which is created by bombarding plutonium with neutrons in a nuclear reactor. It decays by emitting alpha particles and gamma radiation to become neptunium-237. Smoke detectors use a very small quantity of 241Am (about 0.29 micrograms per smoke detector) in the form of americium dioxide. 241Am is used as it emits alpha particles which ionize the air in the detector's ionization chamber. A small electric voltage is applied to the ionized air which gives rise to a small electric current. In the presence of smoke, some of the ions are neutralized, thereby decreasing the current, which activates the detector's alarm.\nImpacts on organisms.\nRadionuclides that find their way into the environment may cause harmful effects as radioactive contamination. They can also cause damage if they are excessively used during treatment or in other ways exposed to living beings, by radiation poisoning. Potential health damage from exposure to radionuclides depends on a number of factors, and \"can damage the functions of healthy tissue/organs. Radiation exposure can produce effects ranging from skin redness and hair loss, to radiation burns and acute radiation syndrome. Prolonged exposure can lead to cells being damaged and in turn lead to cancer. Signs of cancerous cells might not show up until years, or even decades, after exposure.\"\nSummary table for classes of nuclides, stable and radioactive.\nFollowing is a summary table for the list of 986 nuclides with half-lives greater than one hour. A total of 251 nuclides have never been observed to decay, and are classically considered stable. Of these, 90 are believed to be absolutely stable except to proton decay (which has never been observed), while the rest are \"observationally stable\" and theoretically can undergo radioactive decay with extremely long half-lives.\nThe remaining tabulated radionuclides have half-lives longer than 1 hour, and are well-characterized (see list of nuclides for a complete tabulation). They include 31 nuclides with measured half-lives longer than the estimated age of the universe (13.8\u00a0billion years), and another four nuclides with half-lives long enough (&gt;\u00a0100\u00a0million years) that they are radioactive primordial nuclides, and may be detected on Earth, having survived from their presence in interstellar dust since before the formation of the Solar System, about 4.6 billion years ago. Another 60+ short-lived nuclides can be detected naturally as daughters of longer-lived nuclides or cosmic-ray products. The remaining known nuclides are known solely from artificial nuclear transmutation.\nNumbers may change slightly in the future as some nuclides now classified as stable are observed to be radioactive with very long half-lives.\nThis is a summary table for the 986 nuclides with half-lives longer than one hour (including those that are stable), given in list of nuclides.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the founder of the Church of Scotland.\nBorn in Giffordgate, a street in Haddington, East Lothian, Knox is believed to have been educated at the University of St Andrews and worked as a notary-priest. Influenced by early church reformers such as George Wishart, he joined the movement to reform the Scottish Church. He was caught up in the ecclesiastical and political events that involved the murder of Cardinal David Beaton in 1546 and the intervention of the regent Mary of Guise. He was taken prisoner by French forces the following year and exiled to England on his release in 1549.\nWhile in exile, Knox was licensed to work in the Church of England, where he rose in the ranks to serve King Edward VI of England as a royal chaplain. He exerted a reforming influence on the text of the \"Book of Common Prayer\". In England, he met and married his first wife, Margery Bowes. When Queen Mary I ascended the throne of England and re-established Catholicism, Knox was forced to resign his position and leave the country. Knox moved to Geneva and then to Frankfurt. In Geneva, he met John Calvin, from whom he gained experience and knowledge of Reformed theology and presbyterian polity. He created a new order of service, \"The Forme of Prayers\", which was eventually adopted by the Reformed Church in Scotland and came to be known as the \"Book of Common Order\". It was the first book printed in any Gaelic language. Knox left Geneva to head the English refugee church in Frankfurt but he was forced to leave over differences concerning the liturgy, thus ending his association with the Church of England.\nOn his return to Scotland, Knox led the Protestant Reformation in Scotland, in partnership with the Scottish Protestant nobility. The movement may be seen as a revolution since it led to the ousting of Mary of Guise, who governed the country in the name of her young daughter Mary, Queen of Scots. Knox helped write the new confession of faith and the ecclesiastical order for the newly created Reformed Church, the Kirk. He wrote his five-volume \"The History of the Reformation in Scotland\" between 1559 and 1566. He continued to serve as the religious leader of the Protestants throughout Mary's reign. In several interviews with the Queen, Knox admonished her for supporting Catholic practices. After she was imprisoned for her alleged role in the murder of her husband Lord Darnley, and King James VI was enthroned in her stead, Knox openly called for her execution. He continued to preach until his final days.\nEarly life, 1505\u20131546.\nJohn Knox was born sometime between 1505 and 1515 in or near Haddington, the county town of East Lothian. His father, William Knox, was a merchant. All that is known of his mother is that her maiden name was Sinclair and that she died when John Knox was a child. Their eldest son, William, carried on his father's business, which helped in Knox's international communications.\nKnox was probably educated at the grammar school in Haddington. At this time, the priesthood was the only path for those whose inclinations were academic rather than mercantile or agricultural. He proceeded to further studies at the University of St Andrews or possibly at the University of Glasgow. He studied under John Major, one of the greatest scholars of the time. Knox was ordained a Catholic priest in Edinburgh on Easter Eve of 1536 by William Chisholm, Bishop of Dunblane.\nKnox first appears in public records as a priest and a notary in 1540. He was still serving in these capacities as late as 1543 when he described himself as a \"minister of the sacred altar in the diocese of St Andrews, notary by apostolic authority\" in a notarial deed dated 27 March. Rather than taking up duties as a parish priest, Knox became tutor to two sons of Hugh Douglas of Longniddry. He also taught the son of John Cockburn of Ormiston. Both of these lairds had embraced the new religious ideas of the Reformation.\nEmbracing the Protestant Reformation, 1546\u20131547.\nKnox did not record when or how he was converted to the Protestant faith, but perhaps the key formative influences on Knox were Patrick Hamilton and George Wishart. Wishart was a reformer who had fled Scotland in 1538 to escape punishment for heresy. He first moved to England, where in Bristol he preached against the veneration of the Virgin Mary. He was forced to make a public recantation and was burned in effigy at the Church of St Nicholas as a sign of his abjuration. He then took refuge in Germany and Switzerland. While on the Continent, he translated the First Helvetic Confession into English. He returned to Scotland in 1544, but the timing of his return was unfortunate. In December 1543, James Hamilton, Duke of Ch\u00e2tellerault, the appointed regent for the infant Mary, Queen of Scots, had decided with the Queen Mother, Mary of Guise, and Cardinal David Beaton to persecute the Protestant sect that had taken root in Scotland. Wishart travelled throughout Scotland preaching in favour of the Reformation, and when he arrived in East Lothian, Knox became one of his closest associates. Knox acted as his bodyguard, bearing a two-handed sword in order to defend him. In December 1545, Wishart was seized on Beaton's orders by the Earl of Bothwell and taken to the Castle of St Andrews. Knox was present on the night of Wishart's arrest and was prepared to follow him into captivity, but Wishart persuaded him against this course saying, \"Nay, return to your bairns [children] and God bless you. One is sufficient for a sacrifice.\" Wishart was subsequently prosecuted by Beaton's Public Accuser of Heretics, Archdeacon John Lauder. On 1 March 1546, he was burnt at the stake in the presence of Beaton.\nKnox had avoided being arrested by Lord Bothwell through Wishart's advice to return to tutoring. He took shelter with Douglas in Longniddry. Several months later he was still in charge of the pupils, the sons of Douglas and Cockburn, who wearied of moving from place to place while being pursued. He toyed with the idea of fleeing to Germany and taking his pupils with him. While Knox remained a fugitive, Beaton was murdered on 29 May 1546, within his residence, the Castle of St Andrews, by a gang of five persons in revenge for Wishart's execution. The assassins seized the castle and eventually their families and friends took refuge with them, about a hundred and fifty men in all. Among their friends was Henry Balnaves, a former secretary of state in the government, who negotiated with England for the financial support of the rebels. Douglas and Cockburn suggested to Knox to take their sons to the relative safety of the castle to continue their instruction in reformed doctrine, and Knox arrived at the castle on 10 April 1547.\nKnox's powers as a preacher came to the attention of the chaplain of the garrison, John Rough. While Rough was preaching in the parish church on the Protestant principle of the popular election of a pastor, he proposed Knox to the congregation for that office. Knox did not relish the idea. According to his own account, he burst into tears and fled to his room. Within a week, however, he was giving his first sermon to a congregation that included his old teacher, John Major. He expounded on the seventh chapter of the Book of Daniel, comparing the Pope with the Antichrist. His sermon was marked by his consideration of the Bible as his sole authority and the doctrine of justification by faith alone, two elements that would remain in his thoughts throughout the rest of his life. A few days later, a debate was staged that allowed him to lay down additional theses including the rejection of the Mass, Purgatory, and prayers for the dead.\nConfinement in the French galleys, 1547\u20131549.\nJohn Knox's chaplaincy of the castle garrison was not to last long. While Hamilton was willing to negotiate with England to stop their support of the rebels and bring the castle back under his control, Mary of Guise decided that it could be taken only by force and requested the king of France, Henry II to intervene. On 29 June 1547, 21 French galleys approached St Andrews under the command of Leone Strozzi, prior of Capua. The French besieged the castle and forced the surrender of the garrison on 31 July. The Protestant nobles and others, including Knox, were taken prisoner and forced to row in the French galleys. The galley slaves were chained to benches and rowed throughout the day without a change of posture while an officer watched over them with a whip in hand. They sailed to France and navigated up the Seine to Rouen. The nobles, some of whom would have a bearing on Knox's later life such as William Kirkcaldy and Henry Balnaves, were sent to various castle-prisons in France. Knox and the other galley slaves continued to Nantes and stayed on the Loire throughout the winter. They were threatened with torture if they did not give proper signs of reverence when mass was performed on the ship. Knox recounted an incident in which one of the prisoners\u2014possibly himself, as Knox tended to narrate personal anecdotes in the third person\u2014was required to show devotion to a picture of the Virgin Mary. The prisoner was told to give it a kiss of veneration. He refused and when the picture was pushed up to his face, the prisoner seized the picture and threw it into the sea, saying, \"Let our Lady now save herself: she is light enough: let her learn to swim.\" After that, according to Knox, the Scottish prisoners were no longer forced to perform such devotions.\nIn mid-1548, the galleys returned to Scotland to scout for English ships. Knox's health was now at its lowest point due to the severity of his confinement. He was ill with a fever and others on the ship were afraid for his life. Even in this state, Knox recalled, his mind remained sharp and he comforted his fellow prisoners with hopes of release. While the ships were lying offshore between St Andrews and Dundee, the spires of the parish church where he preached appeared in view. James Balfour, a fellow prisoner, asked Knox whether he recognised the landmark. He replied that he knew it well, recognising the steeple of the place where he first preached and he declared that he would not die until he had preached there again.\nIn February 1549, after spending a total of 19 months in the galley-prison, Knox was released. It is uncertain how he obtained his liberty. Later in the year, Henry II arranged with Edward VI of England the release of all remaining Castilian prisoners.\nExile in England, 1549\u20131554.\nOn his release, Knox took refuge in England. The Reformation in England was a less radical movement than its Continental counterparts, but there was a definite breach with Rome. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer, and the regent of King Edward VI, the Duke of Somerset, were decidedly Protestant-minded. However, much work remained to bring reformed ideas to the clergy and to the people. On 7 April 1549, Knox was licensed to work in the Church of England. His first commission was in Berwick-upon-Tweed. He was obliged to use the recently released 1549 \"Book of Common Prayer\", which maintained the structure of the Sarum Rite while adapting the content to the doctrine of the reformed Church of England. Knox, however, modified its use to accord with the doctrinal emphases of the Continental reformers. In the pulpit, he preached Protestant doctrines with great effect as his congregation grew. \nIn England, Knox met his wife, Margery Bowes (died c.\u20091560). Her father, Richard Bowes (died 1558), was a descendant of an old Durham family and her mother, Elizabeth Aske, was an heiress of a Yorkshire family, the Askes of Richmondshire. Elizabeth presumably met Knox when he was employed in Berwick. Several letters reveal a close friendship between them. It is not recorded when Knox married Margery Bowes. Knox attempted to obtain the consent of the Bowes family, but her father and her brother Robert Bowes were opposed to the marriage.\nTowards the end of 1550, Knox was appointed a preacher of St Nicholas' Church in Newcastle upon Tyne. The following year he was appointed one of the six royal chaplains serving the King. On 16 October 1551, John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, overthrew the Duke of Somerset to become the new regent of the young King. Knox condemned the \"coup d'\u00e9tat\" in a sermon on All Saints Day. When Dudley visited Newcastle and listened to his preaching in June 1552, he had mixed feelings about the firebrand preacher, but he saw Knox as a potential asset. Knox was asked to come to London to preach before the Court. In his first sermon, he advocated a change for the 1552 \"Book of Common Prayer\". The liturgy required worshippers to kneel during communion. Knox and the other chaplains considered this to be idolatry. It triggered a debate where Archbishop Cranmer was called upon to defend the practice. The result was a compromise in which the famous Black Rubric, which declared that no adoration is intended while kneeling, was included in the second edition.\nSoon afterwards, Dudley, who saw Knox as a useful political tool, offered him the bishopric of Rochester. Knox refused, and he returned to Newcastle. On 2 February 1553 Cranmer was ordered to appoint Knox as vicar of All Hallows, Bread Street, in London, placing him under the authority of the Bishop of London, Nicholas Ridley. Knox returned to London in order to deliver a sermon before the King and the Court during Lent and he again refused to take the assigned post. Knox was then told to preach in Buckinghamshire and he remained there until Edward's death on 6 July. Edward's successor, Mary Tudor, re-established Roman Catholicism in England and restored the Mass in all the churches. With the country no longer safe for Protestant preachers, Knox left for the Continent in January 1554 on the advice of friends. On the eve of his flight, he wrote:\nSometime I have thought that impossible it had been, so to have removed my affection from the realm of Scotland, that any realm or nation could have been equal dear to me. But God I take to record in my conscience, that the troubles present (and appearing to be) in the realm of England are double more dolorous unto my heart than ever were the troubles of Scotland.\nFrom Geneva to Frankfurt and Scotland, 1554\u20131556.\nKnox disembarked in Dieppe, France, and continued to Geneva, where John Calvin had established his authority. When Knox arrived Calvin was in a difficult position. He had recently overseen the Company of Pastors, which prosecuted charges of heresy against the scholar Michael Servetus, although Calvin himself was not capable of voting for or against a civil penalty against Servetus. Knox asked Calvin four difficult political questions: whether a minor could rule by divine right, whether a female could rule and transfer sovereignty to her husband, whether people should obey ungodly or idolatrous rulers, and what party godly persons should follow if they resisted an idolatrous ruler. Calvin gave cautious replies and referred him to the Swiss reformer Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich. Bullinger's responses were equally cautious, but Knox had already made up his mind. On 20 July 1554, he published a pamphlet attacking Mary Tudor and the bishops who had brought her to the throne. He also attacked the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, calling him \"no less enemy to Christ than was Nero\".\nIn a letter dated 24 September 1554, Knox received an invitation from a congregation of English exiles in Frankfurt to become one of their ministers. He accepted the call with Calvin's blessing. But no sooner had he arrived than he found himself in a conflict. The first set of refugees to arrive in Frankfurt had subscribed to a reformed liturgy and used a modified version of the \"Book of Common Prayer\". More recently arrived refugees, however, including Edmund Grindal, the future Archbishop of Canterbury, favoured a stricter application of the book. When Knox and a supporting colleague, William Whittingham, wrote to Calvin for advice, they were told to avoid contention. Knox therefore agreed on a temporary order of service based on a compromise between the two sides. This delicate balance was disturbed when a new batch of refugees arrived that included Richard Cox, one of the principal authors of the \"Book of Common Prayer\". Cox brought Knox's pamphlet attacking the emperor to the attention of the Frankfurt authorities, who advised that Knox leave. His departure from Frankfurt on 26 March 1555 marked his final breach with the Church of England.\nAfter his return to Geneva, Knox was chosen to be the minister at a new place of worship petitioned from Calvin. As such, he exerted an influence on French Protestants, whether they were exiled in Geneva or in France. In the meantime, Elizabeth Bowes wrote to Knox, asking him to return to Margery in Scotland, which he did at the end of August. Despite initial doubts about the state of the Reformation in Scotland, Knox found the country significantly changed since he was carried off in the galley in 1547. When he toured various parts of Scotland preaching the reformed doctrines and liturgy, he was welcomed by many of the nobility including two future regents of Scotland, the Earl of Moray and the Earl of Mar.\nThough the Queen Regent, Mary of Guise, made no move against Knox, his activities caused concern among the church authorities. The bishops of Scotland viewed him as a threat to their authority and summoned him to appear in Edinburgh on 15 May 1556. He was accompanied to the trial by so many influential persons that the bishops decided to call the hearing off. Knox was now free to preach openly in Edinburgh. William Keith, the Earl Marischal, was impressed and urged Knox to write to the Queen Regent. Knox's unusually respectful letter urged her to support the Reformation and overthrow the church hierarchy. Queen Mary took the letter as a joke and ignored it.\nReturn to Geneva, 1556\u20131559.\nShortly after Knox sent the letter to the Queen Regent, he suddenly announced that he felt his duty was to return to Geneva. In the previous year on 1 November 1555, the congregation in Geneva had elected Knox as their minister and he decided to take up the post. He wrote a final letter of advice to his supporters and left Scotland with his wife and mother-in-law. He arrived in Geneva on 13 September 1556.\nFor the next two years, he lived a happy life in Geneva. He recommended Geneva to his friends in England as the best place of asylum for Protestants. In one letter he wrote:\nI neither fear nor eschame to say, is the most perfect school of Christ that ever was in the earth since the days of the apostles. In other places I confess Christ to be truly preached; but manners and religion so sincerely reformed, I have not yet seen in any other place\u00a0...\nKnox led a busy life in Geneva. He preached three sermons a week, each lasting well over two hours. The services used a liturgy that was derived by Knox and other ministers from Calvin's \"Formes des Pri\u00e8res Eccl\u00e9siastiques\". According to Laing, this order of service with some additions eventually became the \"Book of Common Order\" of the Kirk in 1565. The church in which Knox preached, the \"\u00c9glise de Notre Dame la Neuve\"\u2014now known as the Auditoire de Calvin\u2014had been granted by the municipal authorities, at Calvin's request, for the use of the English and Italian congregations. Knox's two sons, Nathaniel and Eleazar, were born in Geneva, with Whittingham and Myles Coverdale their respective godfathers.\nIn mid-1558, Knox published his best-known pamphlet, \"The first blast of the trumpet against the monstruous regiment of women\". In calling the \"regimen\" or rule of women \"monstruous\", he meant that it was \"unnatural\". Knox states that his purpose was to demonstrate \"how abominable before God is the Empire or Rule of a wicked woman, yea, of a traiteresse and bastard\". The women rulers that Knox had in mind were Queen Mary I of England and Mary of Guise, the Dowager Queen of Scotland and regent on behalf of her daughter, Mary, Queen of Scots. This biblical position was not unusual in Knox's day; however, even he was aware that the pamphlet was dangerously seditious. He therefore published it anonymously and did not tell Calvin, who denied knowledge of it until a year after its publication, that he had written it. In England, the pamphlet was officially condemned by royal proclamation. The impact of the document was complicated later that year when Elizabeth Tudor, a Protestant, became Queen of England. Although Knox had not targeted Elizabeth, he had deeply offended her, and she never forgave him.\nWith a Protestant on the throne, the English refugees in Geneva prepared to return home. Knox himself decided to return to Scotland. Before his departure, various honours were conferred on him, including the freedom of the city of Geneva. Knox left in January 1559, but he did not arrive in Scotland until 2 May 1559, owing to Elizabeth's refusal to issue him a passport through England.\nRevolution and end of the regency, 1559\u20131560.\nTwo days after Knox arrived in Edinburgh, he proceeded to Dundee where a large number of Protestant sympathisers had gathered. Knox was declared an outlaw, and the Queen Regent summoned the Protestants to Stirling. Fearing the possibility of a summary trial and execution, the Protestants proceeded instead to Perth, a walled town that could be defended in case of a siege. At the church of St John the Baptist, Knox preached a fiery sermon and a small incident precipitated into a riot. A mob poured into the church and it was soon gutted. The mob then attacked two friaries (Blackfriars and Greyfriars) in the town, looting their gold and silver and smashing images. Mary of Guise gathered those nobles loyal to her and a small French army. She dispatched the Earl of Argyll and Lord Moray to offer terms and avert a war. She promised not to send any French troops into Perth if the Protestants evacuated the town. The Protestants agreed, but when the Queen Regent entered Perth, she garrisoned it with Scottish soldiers on the French payroll. This was seen as treacherous by Lord Argyll and Lord Moray, who both switched sides and joined Knox, who now based himself in St Andrews. Knox's return to St Andrews fulfilled the prophecy he made in the galleys that he would one day preach again in its church. When he did give a sermon, the effect was the same as in Perth. The people engaged in vandalism and looting. In June 1559, a Protestant mob incited by the preaching of John Knox ransacked the cathedral; the interior of the building was destroyed. The cathedral fell into decline following the attack and became a source of building material for the town. By 1561 it had been abandoned and left to fall into ruin.\nWith Protestant reinforcements arriving from neighbouring counties, the Queen Regent retreated to Dunbar. By now, the mob fury had spilled over central Scotland. Her own troops were on the verge of mutiny. On 30 June, the Protestant Lords of the Congregation occupied Edinburgh, though they were able to hold it for only a month. But even before their arrival, the mob had already sacked the churches and the friaries. On 1 July, Knox preached from the pulpit of St Giles', the most influential in the capital. The Lords of the Congregation negotiated their withdrawal from Edinburgh by the Articles of Leith signed 25 July 1559, and Mary of Guise promised freedom of conscience.\nKnox knew that the Queen Regent would ask for help from France, so he negotiated by letter under the assumed name John Sinclair with William Cecil, Elizabeth's chief adviser, for English support. Knox sailed secretly to Lindisfarne, off the northeast coast of England at the end of July, to meet James Croft and Sir Henry Percy at Berwick upon Tweed. Knox was indiscreet and news of his mission soon reached Mary of Guise. He returned to Edinburgh telling Croft he had to return to his flock, and suggested that Henry Balnaves should go to Cecil.\nWhen additional French troops arrived in Leith, Edinburgh's seaport, the Protestants responded by retaking Edinburgh. This time, on 24 October 1559, the Scottish nobility formally deposed Mary of Guise from the regency. Her secretary, William Maitland of Lethington, defected to the Protestant side, bringing his administrative skills. From then on, Maitland took over the political tasks, freeing Knox for the role of religious leader. For the final stage of the revolution, Maitland appealed to Scottish patriotism to fight French domination. Following the Treaty of Berwick, support from England finally arrived and by the end of March, a significant English army joined the Scottish Protestant forces. The sudden death of Mary of Guise in Edinburgh Castle on 10 June 1560 paved the way for an end to hostilities, the signing of the Treaty of Edinburgh, and the withdrawal of French and English troops from Scotland. On 19 July, Knox held a National Thanksgiving Service at St Giles'.\nReformation in Scotland, 1560\u20131561.\nOn 1 August, the Scottish Parliament met to settle religious issues. Knox and five other ministers, all called John, were called upon to draw up a new confession of faith. Within four days, the Scots Confession was presented to Parliament, voted upon, and approved. A week later, the Parliament passed three acts in one day: the first abolished the jurisdiction of the Pope in Scotland, the second condemned all doctrine and practice contrary to the reformed faith, and the third forbade the celebration of Mass in Scotland. Before the dissolution of Parliament, Knox and the other ministers were given the task of organising the newly reformed church or the Kirk. They would work for several months on the \"Book of Discipline\", the document describing the organisation of the new church. During this period, in December 1560, Knox's wife, Margery, died, leaving Knox to care for their two sons, aged three and a half and two years old. John Calvin, who had lost his own wife in 1549, wrote a letter of condolence.\nParliament reconvened on 15 January 1561 to consider the \"Book of Discipline\". The Kirk was to be run on democratic lines. Each congregation was free to choose or reject its own pastor, but once he was chosen he could not be fired. Each parish was to be self-supporting, as far as possible. The bishops were replaced by ten to twelve \"superintendents\". The plan included a system of national education based on universality as a fundamental principle. Certain areas of law were placed under ecclesiastical authority. The Parliament did not approve the plan, however, mainly for reasons of finance. The Kirk was to be financed out of the patrimony of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland. Much of this was now in the hands of the nobles, who were reluctant to give up their possessions. A final decision on the plan was delayed because of the impending return of Mary, Queen of Scots.\nKnox and Queen Mary, 1561\u20131564.\nOn 19 August 1561, cannons were fired in Leith to announce Queen Mary's arrival in Scotland. When she attended Mass being celebrated in the royal chapel at Holyrood Palace five days later, this prompted a protest in which one of her servants was jostled. The next day she issued a proclamation that there would be no alteration in the current state of religion and that her servants should not be molested or troubled. Many nobles accepted this, but not Knox. The following Sunday, he protested from the pulpit of St Giles'. As a result, just two weeks after her return, Mary summoned Knox. She accused him of inciting a rebellion against her mother and of writing a book against her own authority. Knox answered that as long as her subjects found her rule convenient, he was willing to accept her governance, noting that Paul the Apostle had been willing to live under Nero's rule. Mary noted, however, that he had written against the principle of female rule itself. He responded that she should not be troubled by what had never harmed her. When Mary asked him whether subjects had a right to resist their ruler, he replied that if monarchs exceeded their lawful limits, they might be resisted, even by force.\nOn 13 December 1562, Mary sent for Knox again after he gave a sermon denouncing certain celebrations which Knox had interpreted as rejoicing at the expense of the Reformation. She charged that Knox spoke irreverently of the Queen in order to make her appear contemptible to her subjects. After Knox gave an explanation of the sermon, Mary stated that she did not blame Knox for the differences of opinion and asked that in the future he come to her directly if he heard anything about her that he disliked. Despite her gesture, Knox replied that he would continue to voice his convictions in his sermons and would not wait upon her.\nDuring Easter in 1563, some priests in Ayrshire celebrated Mass, thus defying the law. Some Protestants tried to enforce the law themselves by apprehending these priests. This prompted Mary to summon Knox for the third time. She asked Knox to use his influence to promote religious toleration. He defended their actions and noted she was bound to uphold the laws and if she did not, others would. Mary surprised Knox by agreeing that the priests would be brought to justice.\nThe most dramatic interview between Mary and Knox took place on 24 June 1563. Mary summoned Knox to Holyrood after hearing that he had been preaching against her proposed marriage to Don Carlos, the son of Philip II of Spain. Mary began by scolding Knox, then she burst into tears. \"What have ye to do with my marriage?\" she asked, and \"What are ye within this commonwealth?\" \"A subject born within the same, Madam,\" Knox replied. He noted that though he was not of noble birth, he had the same duty as any subject to warn of dangers to the realm. When Mary started to cry again, he said, \"Madam, in God's presence I speak: I never delighted in the weeping of any of God's creatures; yea I can scarcely well abide the tears of my own boys whom my own hand corrects, much less can I rejoice in your Majesty's weeping.\" He added that he would rather endure her tears, however, than remain silent and \"betray my Commonwealth\". At this, Mary ordered him out of the room.\nKnox's final encounter with Mary was prompted by an incident at Holyrood. While Mary was absent from Edinburgh on her summer progress in 1563, a crowd forced its way into her private chapel as Mass was being celebrated. During the altercation, the priest's life was threatened. As a result, two of the ringleaders, burgesses of Edinburgh, were scheduled for trial on 24 October 1563. In order to defend these men, Knox sent out letters calling the nobles to convene. Mary obtained one of these letters and asked her advisors if this was not a treasonable act. Stewart and Maitland, wanting to keep good relations with both the Kirk and the Queen, asked Knox to admit he was wrong and to settle the matter quietly. Knox refused and he defended himself in front of Mary and the Privy Council. He argued that he had called a legal, not an illegal, assembly as part of his duties as a minister of the Kirk. After he left, the councillors voted not to charge him with treason.\nFinal years in Edinburgh, 1564\u20131572.\nOn 26 March 1564, Knox stirred controversy again when he married Margaret Stewart, the daughter of an old friend, Andrew Stewart, 2nd Lord Ochiltree, a member of the Stuart family and a distant relative of the Queen, Mary Stuart. The marriage was unusual because he was a widower of fifty, while the bride was only seventeen. Very few details are known of their domestic life. They had three daughters, Martha, Margaret, and Elizabeth.\nWhen the General Assembly convened in June 1564, an argument broke out between Knox and Maitland over the authority of the civil government. Maitland told Knox to refrain from stirring up emotions over Mary's insistence on having mass celebrated and he quoted from Martin Luther and John Calvin about obedience to earthly rulers. Knox retorted that the Bible notes that Israel was punished when it followed an unfaithful king and that the Continental reformers were refuting arguments made by the Anabaptists who rejected all forms of government. The debate revealed his waning influence on political events as the nobility continued to support Mary.\nAfter the wedding of Mary and Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, on 29 July 1565, some of the Protestant nobles, including James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray, rose up in a rebellion known as the \"Chaseabout Raid\". Knox revealed his own objection to the marriage while preaching in the presence of the new King Consort on 19 August 1565. He made passing allusions to ungodly rulers which caused Darnley to walk out. Knox was summoned and prohibited from preaching while the court was in Edinburgh.\nOn 9 March 1566, Mary's secretary, David Rizzio, was murdered by conspirators loyal to Darnley. Mary escaped from Edinburgh to Dunbar and by 18 March returned with a formidable force. Knox fled to Kyle in Ayrshire, where he completed the major part of his \"magnum opus\", \"History of the Reformation in Scotland\". When he returned to Edinburgh, he found the Protestant nobles divided over what to do with Mary. Lord Darnley had been murdered and the Queen almost immediately married the chief suspect, the Earl of Bothwell. The indictment of murder thus upon her, she was forced to abdicate and was imprisoned in Lochleven Castle. Lord Moray had become the regent of King James VI. Other old friends of Knox, Lord Argyll and William Kirkcaldy, stood by Mary. On 29 July 1567, Knox preached James VI's coronation sermon at the church of the Holy Rude in Stirling. During this period Knox thundered against her in his sermons, even to the point of calling for her death. However, Mary's life was spared, and she escaped on 2 May 1568.\nThe fighting in Scotland continued as a civil war. Lord Moray was assassinated on 23 January 1570. The regent who succeeded him, the Earl of Lennox, was also a victim of violence. On 30 April 1571, the controller of Edinburgh Castle, Kirkcaldy of Grange, ordered all enemies of the Queen to leave the city. But for Knox, his former friend and fellow galley slave, he made an exception. If Knox did not leave, he could stay in Edinburgh, but only if he remained captive in the castle. Knox chose to leave, and on 5 May he left for St Andrews. He continued to preach, spoke to students, and worked on his \"History\". At the end of July 1572, after a truce was called, he returned to Edinburgh. Although by this time exceedingly feeble and his voice faint, he continued to preach at St Giles'.\nAfter inducting his successor, James Lawson of Aberdeen, as minister of St Giles' on 9 November, Knox returned to his home for the last time. With his friends and some of the greatest Scottish nobles around him, he asked for the Bible to be read aloud. On his last day, 24 November 1572, his young wife read from Paul's first letter to the Corinthians. A testimony to Knox was pronounced at his grave in the churchyard of St Giles' by James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton, and newly elected regent of Scotland: \"Here lies one who never feared any flesh\". After the churchyard's destruction in 1633 the precise site of Knox's grave cannot be established.\nLegacy.\nIn his will, Knox claimed: \"None have I corrupted, none have I defrauded; merchandise have I not made.\" The paltry sum of money Knox bequeathed to his family, which would have left them in dire poverty, showed that he had not profited from his work in the Kirk. The regent, Lord Morton, asked the General Assembly to continue paying his stipend to his widow for one year after his death, and the regent ensured that Knox's dependents were decently supported.\nKnox was survived by his five children and his second wife. Nathaniel and Eleazar, his two sons by his first wife, attended St John's College, Cambridge. Nathaniel became a Fellow of St John's but died early in 1580. Eleazar was ordained into the Church of England and served in the parish of Great Clacton. He also died young and was buried in the chapel of St John's College in 1591. Knox's second wife, Margaret Knox, married a second time, to Andrew Ker, who was one of those involved in the murder of David Rizzio. Knox's three daughters also married: Martha to Alexander Fairlie; Margaret to Zachary Pont, son of Robert Pont and brother of Timothy Pont; and Elizabeth to John Welsh, a minister of the Kirk.\nKnox's death was barely noticed at the time. Although his funeral was attended by the nobles of Scotland, no major politician or diplomat mentioned his death in their surviving letters. Mary, Queen of Scots, made only two brief references to him in her letters. However, what the rulers feared were Knox's ideas more than Knox himself. He was a successful reformer and it was this philosophy of reformation that had a great impact on the English Puritans. He has also been described as having contributed to the struggle for genuine human freedom, by teaching a duty to oppose unjust government in order to bring about moral and spiritual change. His epitaph reads: \"Here lies one who feared God so much that he never feared the face of any man.\" This is a reference to Matthew 10:28.\nKnox was notable not so much for the overthrow of Roman Catholicism in Scotland, but for assuring the replacement of the established Christian religion with Presbyterianism rather than Anglicanism. Knox was instrumental in the establishment of the Presbyterian polity, though it took 120 years following his death for this to be achieved in 1689. Meanwhile, he accepted the status quo and was happy to see his friends appointed bishops and archbishops, even preaching at the inauguration of the Protestant Archbishop of St Andrews John Douglas in 1571. In that regard, Knox is considered the notional founder of the Presbyterian denomination, whose members number millions worldwide.\nA bust of Knox, by David Watson Stevenson, is in the Hall of Heroes of the National Wallace Monument in Stirling. Knox is commemorated in multiple notable Church of Scotland and presbyterian locations, such as the Glasgow Necropolis, St Giles cathedral and New College, Edinburgh. He is also commemorated in his hometown of Haddington, where the local grammar school, in which John Know was educated, was renamed from Haddington Grammar to the John Knox Memorial Institute in 1879 and gradually became known as just Knox Academy after the construction of the new campus between 1930-1960. A large sculpture of Knox adorns the front of the former John Knox Memorial Institute building (now Meadowpark Knox Academy).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1925, Carol was pressured to renounce his rights (in favour of his son Michael) to the throne and moved to Paris in exile with Lupescu. In July 1927, following the death of his grandfather Ferdinand I, Michael ascended the throne at age five, the youngest crowned head in Europe. As Michael was still a minor, a regency council was instituted, composed of his uncle Prince Nicolas, Patriarch Miron Cristea and Chief Justice Gheorghe Buzdugan. The council proved to be ineffective and, in 1930, Carol returned to Romania and replaced his son as monarch, reigning as Carol II. As a result, Michael returned to being heir apparent to the throne and was given the additional title of Grand Voievod of Alba-Iulia.\nCarol II was forced to abdicate in 1940, and Michael once again became king. Under the government led by the military dictator Ion Antonescu, Romania became aligned with Nazi Germany. In 1944, Michael participated in a coup against Antonescu, appointed Constantin S\u0103n\u0103tescu as his replacement, and subsequently declared an alliance with the Allies. In March 1945, political pressures forced Michael to appoint a pro-Soviet government headed by Petru Groza. From August 1945 to January 1946, Michael went on a \"royal strike\" and unsuccessfully tried to oppose Groza's communist-controlled government by refusing to sign and endorse its decrees. In November 1947, Michael attended the wedding of his cousins, the future Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark in London. Shortly thereafter, on the morning of 30 December 1947, Groza met with Michael and compelled him to abdicate, while the monarchy was abolished. Michael was forced into exile, his properties confiscated, and his citizenship stripped. In 1948, he married Princess Anne of Bourbon-Parma, with whom he had five daughters. The couple eventually settled in Switzerland.\nNicolae Ceau\u0219escu's communist dictatorship was overthrown in December 1989, and the following year Michael attempted to return to Romania, only to be arrested and forced to leave upon arrival. In 1992, Michael was allowed to visit Romania for Easter, where he was greeted by huge crowds; a speech he gave from his hotel window drew an estimated one million people to Bucharest. Alarmed by Michael's popularity, the post-communist government of Ion Iliescu refused to allow him any further visits. In 1997, after Iliescu's defeat by Emil Constantinescu in the presidential election of the previous year, Michael's citizenship was restored and he was allowed to visit Romania again. Several confiscated properties, such as Pele\u0219 Castle and S\u0103v\u00e2r\u0219in Castle, were eventually returned to his family.\nEarly life.\nMichael was born in 1921 at Foi\u0219or Castle on the Royal Complex of Pele\u0219 in Sinaia, Romania, the son of Crown Prince Carol of Romania and Crown Princess Elena. He was born as the paternal grandson of the reigning King Ferdinand I of Romania and maternal grandson of the reigning King Constantine I of Greece.\nWhen Carol eloped with his mistress Elena Magda Lupescu and renounced his rights to the throne in December 1925, Michael was declared heir apparent. Michael succeeded to the throne of Romania upon Ferdinand's death in July 1927, before his sixth birthday. Later, Michael attended a special school established in 1932 by his father.\nReign.\n1930s and the Antonescu era.\nA regency, which included his uncle, Prince Nicolae, Patriarch Miron Cristea, and the country's Chief Justice (Gheorghe Buzdugan, and from October 1929, Constantin S\u0103r\u0103\u021beanu) functioned on behalf of the five-year-old Michael, when he succeeded Ferdinand in 1927. In 1930, Carol II returned to the country at the invitation of politicians dissatisfied with the regency in the context of the Great Depression, and was proclaimed king by the Parliament. Michael was demoted to crown prince with the title \"Grand Voivode of Alba Iulia\". In November 1939, Michael joined the Romanian Senate, as the 1938 Constitution guaranteed him a seat there upon reaching the age of eighteen.\nJust days after the Second Vienna Award, the pro-Nazi anti-Soviet regime of Prime Minister Marshal Ion Antonescu staged a coup d'\u00e9tat against Carol II, whom he claimed to be \"anti-German\". Antonescu suspended the Constitution, dissolved the Parliament, and re-installed the 18-year-old Michael as king, by popular acclaim in September 1940. (Although the Constitution was restored in 1944, and the Romanian Parliament in 1946, Michael did not subsequently take a formal oath nor have his reign approved retroactively by Parliament.) Michael was crowned with the Steel Crown and anointed King of Romania by the Orthodox Patriarch of Romania, Nicodim Munteanu, in the Patriarchal Cathedral of Bucharest, on the day of his accession, 6 September 1940. Although King Michael was formally the Supreme Head of the Army, named \"Conduc\u0103tor\" (\"Leader of the people\"), and entitled to appoint the Prime Minister with full powers, in reality he was forced to remain a figurehead for most of the war, until August 1944. Michael had lunch with Adolf Hitler twice\u2014once with his father in Bavaria in 1937, and with his mother in Berlin in 1941. He also met Benito Mussolini in Italy in 1941.\nTurning against Nazi Germany.\nIn 1944, World War II was going badly for the Axis powers, but Antonescu was still in control of Romania. By August 1944, the Soviet conquest of Romania had become inevitable, and was expected in a few months. On 23 August 1944, Michael joined the pro-Allies politicians, a number of army officers, and armed Communist-led civilians in staging a coup against Antonescu. Michael ordered his arrest by the Royal Palace Guard. On the same night, the new Prime Minister, Lt. General Constantin S\u0103n\u0103tescu\u2014appointed by King Michael\u2014gave custody of Antonescu to the communists (in spite of alleged instructions to the contrary by the King), and the latter delivered him to the Soviets on 1 September. In a radio broadcast to the Romanian nation and army, Michael issued a ceasefire just as the Red Army was penetrating the Moldavian front, proclaimed Romania's loyalty to the Allies, announced the acceptance of the armistice offered by the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and declared war on Germany. However, this did not avert a rapid Soviet occupation and capture of about 130,000 Romanian soldiers, who were transported to the Soviet Union where many perished in prison camps.\nAlthough the country's alliance with Nazi Germany was ended, the coup sped the Red Army's advance into Romania. The armistice was signed three weeks later on 12 September 1944, on terms the Soviets virtually dictated. Under the terms of the armistice, Romania recognized its defeat by the USSR and was placed under occupation of the Allied forces, with the Soviets, as their representative, in control of media, communication, post, and civil administration behind the front. The coup effectively amounted to a \"capitulation\", an \"unconditional\" \"surrender\". It has been suggested by Romanian historians that the coup may have shortened World War II by six months, thus saving hundreds of thousands of lives.\nAt the end of the war, King Michael was awarded the highest degree (Chief Commander) of the American Legion of Merit by U.S. President Harry S. Truman. He was also decorated with the Soviet Order of Victory by Joseph Stalin \"for the courageous act of the radical change in Romania's politics towards a break-up from Hitler's Germany and an alliance with the United Nations, at the moment when there was no clear sign yet of Germany's defeat\", according to the official description of the decoration. With the death of Micha\u0142 Rola-\u017bymierski in 1989, Michael became the sole surviving recipient of the Order of Victory.\nReign under Communism.\nIn March 1945, political pressures forced King Michael to appoint a pro-Soviet government headed by Petru Groza. For the next two-plus years, Michael functioned again as little more than a figurehead. Between August 1945 and January 1946, during what was later known as the \"royal strike\", King Michael tried unsuccessfully to oppose the Groza government by refusing to sign its decrees. In response to Soviet, British, and American pressures, King Michael eventually gave up his opposition to the communist government and stopped demanding its resignation.\nHe did not pardon \"Mare\u0219al\" Antonescu, the former Prime Minister, who was sentenced to death \"for betrayal of the Romanian people for the benefit of Nazi Germany, for the economic and political subjugation of Romania to Germany, for cooperation with the Iron Guard, for murdering his political opponents, for the mass murder of civilians and crimes against peace\". Nor did King Michael manage to save such leaders of the opposition as Iuliu Maniu and the Bratianus, victims of Communist political trials, as the Constitution prevented him from doing so without the counter-signature of Communist Justice Minister Lucre\u021biu P\u0103tr\u0103\u0219canu (who himself was later eliminated by Gheorghiu-Dej's opposing Communist faction). The memoirs of King Michael's aunt Princess Ileana quoted Emil Bodn\u0103ra\u0219\u2014her alleged lover, Romania's Communist minister of defence, and a Soviet spy\u2014as saying: \"Well, if the King decides not to sign the death warrant, I promise that we will uphold his point of view.\" Princess Ileana was sceptical: \"You know quite well (...) that the King will never of his free will sign such an unconstitutional document. If he does, it will be laid at your door, and before the whole nation your government will bear the blame. Surely you do not wish this additional handicap at this moment!\"\nForced abdication.\nIn November 1947, King Michael travelled to London for the wedding of his cousins, Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II) and Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, an occasion during which he met Princess Anne of Bourbon-Parma (his second cousin once removed), who was to become his wife. According to his own account, King Michael rejected any offers of asylum and decided to return to Romania, contrary to the confidential, strong advice of the British Ambassador to Romania.\nEarly on the morning of 30 December 1947, Michael was preparing for a New Year's party at Pele\u0219 Castle in Sinaia, when Groza summoned him back to Bucharest. Michael returned to Elisabeta Palace in Bucharest, to find it surrounded by troops from the Tudor Vladimirescu Division, an army unit completely loyal to the Communists. Groza and Communist Party leader Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej were waiting for him, and demanded that he sign a pre-typed instrument of abdication. Unable to call in loyal troops, due to his telephone lines allegedly being cut, Michael signed the document. Later the same day, the Communist-dominated government announced the abolition of the monarchy, and its replacement by a People's Republic, broadcasting the King's pre-recorded radio proclamation of his own abdication. On 3 January 1948, Michael was forced to leave the country, followed over a week later by Princesses Elisabeth and Ileana, who collaborated so closely with the Soviets that they became known as the King's \"Red Aunts\". He was the last monarch behind the Iron Curtain to lose his throne.\nMichael's own account of the abdication varied over time, and was gradually embellished, especially after 1990. Thus, in accounts published in 1950 and 1977, Michael only mentioned seeing armed groups with machine-guns on their shoulders around the palace, while in much later accounts these were described as \"heavy artillery, ready to fire at any moment\". The story of the supposed blackmail also evolved: in the 1950 account, Groza tried to negotiate some form of material compensations for the abdication, noting he could not guarantee for Michael's life in case he refused, and his refusal could lead to thousand of arrests and possibly a civil war; in a hearing before the United States House of Representatives in 1954, Michael mentioned Groza's generic threats regarding his personal security, bloodshed and ruin of the country, as well as \"vague hints\" of persecution, with Groza suggesting the government had a large dossier on Michael; the possible arrest of thousands and a generic threat of bloodshed is also mentioned in the 1977 account; however, beginning with 1990, Michael claimed that Groza threatened to shoot 1,000 students that had already been arrested for publicly showing their attachment to the throne. Thus, while according to a \"Time\" article published in 1948, Groza threatened to arrest thousands of people and order a bloodbath unless Michael abdicated, in an interview with \"The New York Times\" from 2007, Michael recounted: \"It was blackmail. They said, 'If you don't sign this immediately we are obliged'\u2014why obliged I don't know\u2014'to kill more than 1,000 students' that they had in prison.\" In historian Ioan Scurtu's opinion, the new account was created in order to leverage the recent Revolution of 1989, presented at the time as a revolution of the youth and the students. Another new element in Michael's account after 1990 was that Groza had threatened him at gunpoint; in earlier accounts Michael mentioned that Groza had shown him the pistol he was carrying only after Michael signed the abdication.\nAccording to the autobiography of the former head of the Soviet intelligence agency NKVD, Major General Pavel Sudoplatov, the Deputy Soviet Foreign Commissar Andrey Vyshinsky personally conducted negotiations with King Michael for his abdication, guaranteeing part of a pension to be paid to Michael in Mexico. According to a few articles in \"Jurnalul Na\u021bional\", Michael's abdication was negotiated with the Communist government, which allowed him to leave the country with the goods he requested, accompanied by some of the royal retinue.\nAccording to Albanian Communist leader Enver Hoxha's account of his conversations with the Romanian Communist leaders on the monarch's abdication, it was Gheorghiu-Dej, not Groza, who forced Michael's abdication at gunpoint. He was allowed to leave the country accompanied by some of his entourage and, as confirmed also by the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev recounting Gheorghiu-Dej's confessions, with whatever properties he desired, including gold and rubies. Hoxha also wrote that pro-Communist troops surrounded the palace, to counter army units who were still loyal to the King.\nIn March 1948, Michael denounced his abdication as illegal, and contended he was still the rightful King of Romania. According to \"Time\" magazine, he would have done so sooner, but for much of early 1948, he had been negotiating with the Communists over properties he had left in Romania.\nThere are reports that Romanian Communist authorities allowed King Michael to depart with 42 valuable Crown-owned paintings in November 1947, so that he would leave Romania faster. Some of these paintings were reportedly sold through the famed art dealer Daniel Wildenstein. One of the paintings belonging to the Romanian Crown, which was supposedly taken out of the country by King Michael in November 1947, returned to Romania in 2004 as a donation made by John Kreuger, the former husband of King Michael's daughter Irina.\nIn 2005, Romanian Prime Minister C\u0103lin Popescu-T\u0103riceanu denied these accusations about King Michael, stating that the Romanian government has no proof of any such action by King Michael and that, prior to 1949, the government had no official records of any artwork taken over from the former royal residences. However, according to some historians, such records existed as early as April 1948, having been, in fact, officially published in June 1948.\nAccording to Ivor Porter's authorized biography, \"Michael of Romania: The King and The Country\" (2005), which quotes Queen Mother Helen's daily diary, the Romanian royal family took out paintings belonging to the Romanian Royal Crown, on their November 1947 trip to London to the wedding of the future Queen Elizabeth II; two of these paintings, signed by El Greco, were sold in 1976.\nAccording to declassified Foreign Office documents that were the subject of news reports in 2005, when he left Romania, the exiled King Michael's only assets amounted to 500,000 Swiss francs. Recently declassified Soviet transcripts of talks between Joseph Stalin and the Romanian Prime Minister Petru Groza show that shortly before his abdication, King Michael received from the communist government assets amounting to 500,000 Swiss francs. King Michael, however, repeatedly denied that the Communist government had allowed him to take into exile any financial assets or valuable goods besides four personal automobiles loaded on two train cars.\nMarriage.\nEngagement.\nIn November 1947, Michael I met a distant relative, Princess Anne of Bourbon-Parma, who was visiting London for the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Philip Mountbatten, Duke of Edinburgh. A year before this, Queen Helen, the Queen Mother, had invited Princess Margaret of Bourbon-Parma and her children, who included Anne, to make a visit to Bucharest, but the plan did not come off. Meanwhile, King Michael I had glimpsed Princess Anne in a newsreel and requested a photograph from the film footage.\nShe did not want to accompany her parents to London for the royal wedding as she wished to avoid meeting Michael I in official surroundings. Instead, she planned to stay behind, go alone to the Paris railway station and, pretending to be a passerby in the crowd, privately observe the king as his entourage escorted him to his London-bound train. However, at the last moment she was persuaded by her first cousin, Prince Jean, Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg, to come to London, where he planned to host a party. Upon arrival in London, she stopped by Claridge's to see her parents, and found herself being introduced unexpectedly to King Michael I. Abashed to the point of confusion, she clicked her heels instead of curtseying, and fled in embarrassment. Charmed, the king saw her again the night of the wedding at the Luxembourg embassy \"soir\u00e9e\", confided in her some of his concerns about the Communist takeover of Romania and fears for his mother's safety, and nicknamed her \"Nan\". They saw each other several times thereafter on outings in London, always chaperoned by her mother or brother.\nA few days later, she accepted an invitation to accompany Michael and his mother when he piloted a Beechcraft aeroplane to take his aunt Princess Irene, Duchess of Aosta, back home to Lausanne. Sixteen days after meeting, Michael proposed to Anne while the couple were out on a drive in Lausanne. She initially declined, but later accepted after taking long walks and drives with him. Although Michael gave her an engagement ring a few days later, he felt obliged to refrain from a public announcement until he informed his government, despite the fact that the press besieged them in anticipation.\nMichael I returned to Romania, where he was told by the prime minister that a wedding announcement was not \"opportune\". Yet within days it was used as the government's public explanation for Michael's sudden \"abdication\", when in fact the king was deposed by the Communists on 30 December. Princess Anne was unable to get further news of King Michael I until he left the country. They finally reunited in Davos on 23 January 1948.\nWedding.\nAs a Bourbon, Anne was bound by the canon law of the Roman Catholic Church, which required that she receive a dispensation to marry a non-Catholic Christian (King Michael I was Orthodox). At the time, such a dispensation was normally only given if the non-Roman Catholic partner promised to allow the children of the marriage to be raised as Roman Catholics. Michael refused to make this promise since it would have violated Romania's monarchical constitution, and would be likely to have a detrimental impact upon any possible restoration. The Holy See (which handled the matter directly since King Michael I was a member of a reigning dynasty) refused to grant the dispensation unless Michael made the required promise.\nHelen, Queen Mother of Romania and her sister Princess Irene, Duchess of Aosta (an Orthodox married to a Catholic Prince) met with the fianc\u00e9e's parents in Paris, where the two families resolved to take their case to the Vatican in person. In early March, the couple's mothers met with Pope Pius XII who, despite the entreaties of the Queen Mother and the fact that Anne's mother, Princess Margrethe pounded her fist on the table in anger, refused permission for Anne to marry King Michael I.\nIt has been surmised that the Pope's refusal was, in part, motivated by the fact that when Princess Giovanna of Savoy married Anne's cousin, King Boris III of Bulgaria, in 1930, the couple had undertaken to raise their future children as Roman Catholics, but had baptized them in the Orthodox faith in deference to Bulgaria's state religion. However, King Michael I declined to make a promise he could not keep politically, while Anne's mother was herself the daughter of a mixed marriage between a Catholic (Princess Marie d'Orl\u00e9ans) and a Protestant (Prince Valdemar of Denmark), who had abided by their pre-ne temere compromise to raise their sons as Protestant and their daughter, Margrethe, as Catholic.\nAlthough under a great deal of stress, the engaged couple resolved to proceed. Anne's paternal uncle, Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma, issued a statement objecting to any marriage conducted against the will of the Pope and the bride's family. It was he, not the Pontiff, who forbade Anne's parents to attend the wedding. King Michael I's spokesman declared on 9 June that the parents had been asked and had given their consent, and that the bride's family would be represented at the nuptials by her maternal uncle, the Protestant Prince Erik of Denmark, who was to give the bride away.\nThe wedding ceremony was held on 10 June 1948 in Athens, Greece, in the throne room of the Royal Palace; the ceremony was performed by Archbishop Damaskinos, and King Paul I of Greece served as \"koumbaros\". Guests at the wedding included: Michael's mother The Queen Mother of Romania, aunts Queen Frederica, The Dowager Duchess of Aosta, Lady Katherine Brandram; cousins Prince Amedeo, 5th Duke of Aosta, Princess Sophia of Greece and Denmark, Crown Prince Constantine of Greece and Princess Irene of Greece and Denmark, the three youngest ones serving as bridesmaids and pageboy; Anne's maternal uncle Prince Erik of Denmark; Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia, Princess Olga of Greece and Denmark, Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia, Prince George Wilhelm of Hanover and many other dignitaries. King Michael I's father, Carol, and his sisters, Maria, Queen Mother of Yugoslavia, Princess Elisabeth of Romania (ex-Queen Consort of Greece) and Princess Ileana of Romania were notified, but not invited.\nAs no papal dispensation was given for the marriage, when it was celebrated according to the rites of the Eastern Orthodox Church, it was deemed invalid by the Roman Catholic Church, but perfectly legal by every other authority. The couple eventually took part in a religious ceremony again, on 9 November 1966, at the Roman Catholic Church of St Charles in Monaco, thus satisfying Roman Catholic canon law.\nFamily.\nMichael and Anne had five daughters, five grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren:\nLife in exile.\nMichael would never see his father again, after Carol II's 1940 abdication. Michael could see no point in meeting his father who had humiliated his mother so many times via his open affairs and did not attend his father's funeral in 1953.\nIn January 1948, Michael began using one of his family's ancestral titles, \"Prince of Hohenzollern\", instead of using the title of \"King of Romania\". After denouncing his abdication as forced and illegal in March 1948, Michael resumed use of the kingly title.\nMichael and Princess Anne lived near Florence, Italy, until 1948, near Lausanne, Switzerland, until 1950, and then in Hertfordshire, England, until 1956. After that, the couple settled near Versoix, Switzerland, where they would live for the next 45 years. The Communist Romanian authorities stripped Michael of his Romanian citizenship in 1948.\nDuring exile, Michael had a variety of occupations including farming, stockbroker, entrepreneur, and pilot. In 1957, he worked in Switzerland as a test pilot for a predecessor of aerospace manufacturer Learjet.\nTogether with his wife, he took part in the ship tour organized by Queen Frederica and her husband King Paul of Greece in 1954, which became known as the \u201cCruise of the Kings\u201d and was attended by over 100 royals from all over Europe.\nHe had five daughters with his wife between 1949 and 1964.\nReturn and rehabilitation.\nOn 25 December 1990\u2014a year after the revolution which overthrew the Communist dictatorship of Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu\u2014Michael, accompanied by several members of the royal family, landed at Otopeni Airport and entered Romania for the first time in 43 years. Using a Danish diplomatic passport, Michael was able to obtain a 24-hour visa. He intended to reach Curtea de Arge\u0219 Cathedral, pray at the tombs of his royal ancestors and attend the Christmas religious service. However, on their way to Curtea de Arge\u0219, the former King and his companions were stopped by a police blockade, taken to the airport and forced to leave the country.\nIn 1992, the Romanian government allowed Michael to return to Romania for Easter celebrations, where he drew large crowds. His speech from the balcony of a Hotel Continental 1st Fl. room drew over 100,000 people. His visit in Bucharest drew over a million people in the streets of the capital to see him. Michael refused the offer of the president of the National Liberal Party, Radu C\u00e2mpeanu, to run for elections as president of Romania. Michael's popularity alarmed the government of President Ion Iliescu, and he was forbidden to re-visit Romania, being denied entry twice in 1994 and 1995.\nIn 1997, after Iliescu's defeat by Emil Constantinescu, the Romanian government restored Michael's citizenship and again allowed him to visit the country. He then lived partly in Switzerland at Aubonne and partly in Romania, either at S\u0103v\u00e2r\u0219in Castle in Arad County or in an official residence in Bucharest\u2014the Elisabeta Palace\u2014voted by the Romanian Parliament by a law concerning arrangements for former heads of state. Besides S\u0103v\u00e2r\u0219in Castle, the former private residences Pele\u0219 Castle and Peli\u0219or Castle were also restituted. While Pele\u0219 and Peli\u0219or are open to the public, Elisabeta Palace and S\u0103v\u00e2r\u0219in are used as private residences. \nLater years.\nMichael neither encouraged nor opposed monarchist agitation in Romania and royalist parties have made little impact in post-communist Romanian politics. He took the view that the restoration of the monarchy in Romania can only result from a decision by the Romanian people. \"If the people want me to come back, of course, I will come back,\" he said in 1990. \"Romanians have had enough suffering imposed on them to have the right to be consulted on their future.\" King Michael's belief was that there is still a role for, and value in, the monarchy today: \"We are trying to make people understand what the Romanian monarchy was, and what it can still do [for them].\"\nAccording to a 2007 opinion poll conducted at the request of the Romanian royal family, only 14% of Romanians were in favour of the restoration of the monarchy. Another 2008 poll found that only 16% of Romanians are monarchists. Michael himself, however, was shown to be much more popular personally with the Romanian people: In a July 2013 survey, 45% of Romanians had a good or very good opinion of Michael, with 6.5% thinking the opposite. The royal family also enjoyed similar numbers, with 41% having a good or very good opinion of it, and just 6.5% having a poor or very poor one.\nMichael undertook some quasi-diplomatic roles on behalf of post-communist Romania. In 1997 and 2002 he toured Western Europe, lobbying for Romania's admission into NATO and the European Union, and was received by heads of state and government officials.\nIn December 2003, to the \"stupefaction of the public opinion in Romania\", Michael awarded the \"Man of The Year 2003\" prize to Prime Minister Adrian N\u0103stase, leader of the Social Democratic Party (PSD), on behalf of the tabloid \"VIP\". The daily \"Evenimentul Zilei\" subsequently complained that 'such an activity was unsuited to a king and that Michael was wasting away his prestige', with the majority of the political analysts 'considering his gesture as a fresh abdication'.\nOn 10 May 2007, King Michael received the Prague Society for International Cooperation and Global Panel Foundation's 6th Annual Hanno R. Ellenbogen Citizenship Award, previously awarded to Vladimir Ashkenazy, Madeleine Albright, V\u00e1clav Havel, Lord Robertson, and Milo\u0161 Forman. On 8 April 2008, King Michael and Patriarch Daniel were elected as honorary members of the Romanian Academy.\nMichael participated in the Victory Parade in Moscow in 2010 as the only living Supreme Commander-in-Chief of a European State in the Second World War. The name of Michael I is listed on the memorial in the Grand Kremlin Palace as one of only 20 recipients of the Order of Victory.\nIn old age, Michael enjoyed a strong revival in popularity. On 25 October 2011, on the occasion of his 90th birthday, he delivered a speech before the assembled chambers of the Romanian Parliament. An opinion poll in January 2012 placed him as the most trusted public figure in Romania, far ahead of the political leaders. Later, in October 2012, celebrating Michael's 91st birthday, a square in Bucharest was renamed after him.\nOn 1 August 2016, he became a widower when Queen Anne died at the age of 92.\nHealth issues.\nOn 2 March 2016, the Royal Council announced King Michael's retirement from public life; with tasks assumed by Crown Princess Margareta, his daughter. After surgery, Michael was diagnosed with chronic leukemia and metastatic epidermoid carcinoma and faced a complex and lengthy treatment.\nIn June 2017, the Royal House stated in a press release that \"His Majesty's health is fragile but stable. King Michael is quiet, has soulful appreciation and appreciates the care of his medical team. Along with the King, they are permanently employed by His Majesty's House, detached in Switzerland, and two Orthodox nuns.\"\nAt the end of August 2017, the Royal House announced that King Michael was \"in a fragile but balanced state, and has a good mood,\" stating that Princess Elena had completed a visit to Switzerland for a few days to see her father, at the private residence. According to the Royal House, Michael remained \"daily under close supervision of physicians, medical staff of various specialties, and in the presence of devoted members of the staff of His Majesty's House, stationed in Switzerland.\" Two Orthodox nuns, detached from the Romanian Orthodox Church, remained at the private residence.\nDeath and state funeral.\nOn 5 December 2017, Michael died at his residence in Switzerland at the age of 96, in the presence of his youngest daughter Princess Maria. His coffin, draped by his Royal Standard, was brought back to Romania on 13 December, arriving at the Otopeni Airport in Bucharest from Lausanne, via Payerne Air Base, escorted by his second daughter, Princess Elena with her husband Alexander Nixon, fourth daughter Sophie and also members of the Royal Household, were transported by the Romanian Air Force's Alenia C-27J Spartan transport aircraft, which was flanked by four Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 jet fighters.\nThe coffin was first taken to Pele\u0219 Castle at Sinaia in the Carpathian Mountains. Then, it was brought to Bucharest, where it was laid and displayed at the Royal Palace for two days. King Michael I was buried on 16 December with full state honours in the Mausoleum of the Royal Family, on the grounds of the Curtea de Arge\u0219 Cathedral together with his wife Queen Anne who died in 2016. His body was transferred from Bucharest to Curtea de Arge\u0219 with the help of a funeral train, the Royal Train, and a repainted domestic-traffic carriage, being led by a diesel locomotive. His funeral is stated to have been one of the largest in Romania, with almost a million Romanians flocking to the capital to pay their respects and watch the funeral, with it being comparable to the one of Corneliu Coposu in 1995.\nLine of succession.\nAccording to the succession provisions of the Romanian kingdom's last democratically approved monarchical constitution of 1923, upon the death of King Michael without sons, the claim to the Crown devolves once again upon the Hohenzollern family. However, on 30 December 2007, on the 60th anniversary of his abdication, King Michael signed the \"Fundamental Rules of the Royal Family of Romania\", by which he designated Princess Margareta as his heir. The document has no legal standing, as it regulates an institution that is no longer extant. \nOn 10 May 2011, on a background of lawsuits in Germany brought against his family by Michael's German relatives regarding the former name Hohenzollern-Veringen of his son-in-law, Radu, and of fears expressed by some that the German Hohenzollerns may claim succession to the headship of the Romanian royal house, Michael severed all of the dynastic and historical ties with the princely house of Hohenzollern, changed the name of his family to \"of Romania\", and gave up all princely titles conferred upon him and his family by the German Hohenzollerns.\nOn 1 August 2015, Michael signed a document removing the title Prince of Romania and the qualification of Royal Highness from his grandson, Nicholas Medforth-Mills, who was also removed from the line of succession. The former king took the decision \"with an eye on Romania's future after the reign and life of his eldest daughter, Margareta\". The former king hoped that \"Nicholas will find in future years a suitable way to serve the ideals and use the qualities that God gave him\". Nicholas's mother, Princess Elena, received notification of the former king's decision in a personal letter.\nPersonality and personal interests.\nAged 16, when Michael was crown prince, he hit a bicyclist while driving a car, causing the cyclist's death.

It is a result of many activities, including nuclear medicine, nuclear research, nuclear power generation, nuclear decommissioning, rare-earth mining, and nuclear weapons reprocessing. The storage and disposal of radioactive waste is regulated by government agencies in order to protect human health and the environment.\nRadioactive waste is broadly classified into 3 categories: low-level waste (LLW), such as paper, rags, tools, clothing, which contain small amounts of mostly short-lived radioactivity; intermediate-level waste (ILW), which contains higher amounts of radioactivity and requires some shielding; and high-level waste (HLW), which is highly radioactive and hot due to decay heat, thus requiring cooling and shielding.\nSpent nuclear fuel can be processed in nuclear reprocessing plants. One third of the total amount have already been reprocessed. With nuclear reprocessing 96% of the spent fuel can be recycled back into uranium-based and mixed-oxide (MOX) fuels. The residual 4% is minor actinides and fission products, the latter of which are a mixture of stable and quickly decaying (most likely already having decayed in the spent fuel pool) elements, medium lived fission products such as strontium-90 and caesium-137 and finally seven long-lived fission products with half-lives in the hundreds of thousands to millions of years. The minor actinides, meanwhile, are heavy elements other than uranium and plutonium which are created by neutron capture. Their half-lives range from years to millions of years and as alpha emitters they are particularly radiotoxic. While there are proposed \u2013 and to a much lesser extent current \u2013 uses of all those elements, commercial-scale reprocessing using the PUREX-process disposes of them as waste together with the fission products. The waste is subsequently converted into a glass-like ceramic for storage in a deep geological repository.\nThe time radioactive waste must be stored depends on the type of waste and radioactive isotopes it contains. Short-term approaches to radioactive waste storage have been segregation and storage on the surface or near-surface of the earth. Burial in a deep geological repository is a favored solution for long-term storage of high-level waste, while re-use and transmutation are favored solutions for reducing the HLW inventory. Boundaries to recycling of spent nuclear fuel are regulatory and economic as well as the problem of radioactive contamination if chemical separation processes cannot achieve a very high purity. Furthermore, elements may be present in both useful and troublesome isotopes, which would require costly and energy intensive isotope separation for their use \u2013 a currently uneconomic prospect.\nA summary of the amounts of radioactive waste and management approaches for most developed countries are presented and reviewed periodically as part of a joint convention of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\nNature and significance.\nA quantity of radioactive waste typically consists of a number of radionuclides, which are unstable isotopes of elements that undergo decay and thereby emit ionizing radiation, which is harmful to humans and the environment. Different isotopes emit different types and levels of radiation, which last for different periods of time.\nPhysics.\nThe radioactivity of all radioactive waste weakens with time. All radionuclides contained in the waste have a half-life\u2014the time it takes for half of the atoms to decay into another nuclide. Eventually, all radioactive waste decays into non-radioactive elements (i.e., stable nuclides). Since radioactive decay follows the half-life rule, the rate of decay is inversely proportional to the duration of decay. In other words, the radiation from a long-lived isotope like iodine-129 will be much less intense than that of a short-lived isotope like iodine-131. The two tables show some of the major radioisotopes, their half-lives, and their radiation yield as a proportion of the yield of fission of uranium-235.\nThe energy and the type of the ionizing radiation emitted by a radioactive substance are also important factors in determining its threat to humans. The chemical properties of the radioactive element will determine how mobile the substance is and how likely it is to spread into the environment and contaminate humans. This is further complicated by the fact that many radioisotopes do not decay immediately to a stable state but rather to radioactive decay products within a decay chain before ultimately reaching a stable state.\nPharmacokinetics.\nExposure to radioactive waste may cause health impacts due to ionizing radiation exposure. In humans, a dose of 1 sievert carries a 5.5% risk of developing cancer, and regulatory agencies assume the risk is linearly proportional to dose even for low doses. Ionizing radiation can cause deletions in chromosomes. If a developing organism such as a fetus is irradiated, it is possible a birth defect may be induced, but it is unlikely this defect will be in a gamete or a gamete-forming cell. The incidence of radiation-induced mutations in humans is small, as in most mammals, because of natural cellular-repair mechanisms, many just now coming to light. These mechanisms range from DNA, mRNA and protein repair, to internal lysosomic digestion of defective proteins, and even induced cell suicide\u2014apoptosis\nDepending on the decay mode and the pharmacokinetics of an element (how the body processes it and how quickly), the threat due to exposure to a given activity of a radioisotope will differ. For instance, iodine-131 is a short-lived beta and gamma emitter, but because it concentrates in the thyroid gland, it is more able to cause injury than caesium-137 which, being water soluble, is rapidly excreted through urine. In a similar way, the alpha emitting actinides and radium are considered very harmful as they tend to have long biological half-lives and their radiation has a high relative biological effectiveness, making it far more damaging to tissues per amount of energy deposited. Because of such differences, the rules determining biological injury differ widely according to the radioisotope, time of exposure, and sometimes also the nature of the chemical compound which contains the radioisotope.\nSources.\nRadioactive waste comes from a number of sources. In countries with nuclear power plants, nuclear armament, or nuclear fuel treatment plants, the majority of waste originates from the nuclear fuel cycle and nuclear weapons reprocessing. Other sources include medical and industrial wastes, as well as naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) that can be concentrated as a result of the processing or consumption of coal, oil, and gas, and some minerals, as discussed below.\nNuclear fuel cycle.\nFront end.\nWaste from the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle is usually alpha-emitting waste from the extraction of uranium. It often contains radium and its decay products.\nUranium dioxide (UO2) concentrate from mining is a thousand or so times as radioactive as the granite used in buildings. It is refined from yellowcake (U3O8), then converted to uranium hexafluoride gas (UF6). As a gas, it undergoes enrichment to increase the U-235 content from 0.7% to about 4.4% (LEU). It is then turned into a hard ceramic oxide (UO2) for assembly as reactor fuel elements.\nThe main by-product of enrichment is depleted uranium (DU), principally the U-238 isotope, with a U-235 content of ~0.3%. It is stored, either as UF6 or as U3O8. Some is used in applications where its extremely high density makes it valuable such as anti-tank shells, and on at least one occasion even a sailboat keel. It is also used with plutonium for making mixed oxide fuel (MOX) and to dilute, or downblend, highly enriched uranium from weapons stockpiles which is now being redirected to become reactor fuel.\nBack end.\nThe back-end of the nuclear fuel cycle, mostly spent fuel rods, contains fission products that emit beta and gamma radiation, and actinides that emit alpha particles, such as uranium-234 (half-life 245\u00a0thousand years), neptunium-237 (2.144\u00a0million years), plutonium-238 (87.7\u00a0years) and americium-241 (432 years), and even sometimes some neutron emitters such as californium (half-life of 898 years for californium-251). These isotopes are formed in nuclear reactors.\nIt is important to distinguish the processing of uranium to make fuel from the reprocessing of used fuel. Used fuel contains the highly radioactive products of fission (see high-level waste below). Many of these are neutron absorbers, called neutron poisons in this context. These eventually build up to a level where they absorb so many neutrons that the chain reaction stops, even with the control rods completely removed from a reactor. At that point, the fuel has to be replaced in the reactor with fresh fuel, even though there is still a substantial quantity of uranium-235 and plutonium present. In the United States, this used fuel is usually \"stored\", while in other countries such as Russia, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, and India, the fuel is reprocessed to remove the fission products, and the fuel can then be re-used. The fission products removed from the fuel are a concentrated form of high-level waste as are the chemicals used in the process. While most countries reprocess the fuel carrying out single plutonium cycles, India is planning multiple plutonium recycling schemes and Russia pursues closed cycle.\nFuel composition and long term radioactivity.\nThe use of different fuels in nuclear reactors results in different spent nuclear fuel (SNF) composition, with varying activity curves. The most abundant material being U-238 with other uranium isotopes, other actinides, fission products and activation products.\nLong-lived radioactive waste from the back end of the fuel cycle is especially relevant when designing a complete waste management plan for SNF. When looking at long-term radioactive decay, the actinides in the SNF have a significant influence due to their characteristically long half-lives. Depending on what a nuclear reactor is fueled with, the actinide composition in the SNF will be different.\nAn example of this effect is the use of nuclear fuels with thorium. Th-232 is a fertile material that can undergo a neutron capture reaction and two beta minus decays, resulting in the production of fissile U-233. The SNF of a cycle with thorium will contain U-233. Its radioactive decay will strongly influence the long-term activity curve of the SNF for around a million years. A comparison of the activity associated to U-233 for three different SNF types can be seen in the figure on the top right. The burnt fuels are thorium with reactor-grade plutonium (RGPu), thorium with weapons-grade plutonium (WGPu), and Mixed oxide fuel (MOX, no thorium). For RGPu and WGPu, the initial amount of U-233 and its decay for around a million years can be seen. This has an effect on the total activity curve of the three fuel types. The initial absence of U-233 and its daughter products in the MOX fuel results in a lower activity in region 3 of the figure at the bottom right, whereas for RGPu and WGPu the curve is maintained higher due to the presence of U-233 that has not fully decayed. Nuclear reprocessing can remove the actinides from the spent fuel so they can be used or destroyed (see ).\nProliferation concerns.\nSince uranium and plutonium are nuclear weapons materials, there are proliferation concerns. Ordinarily (in spent nuclear fuel), plutonium is reactor-grade plutonium. In addition to plutonium-239, which is highly suitable for building nuclear weapons, it contains large amounts of undesirable contaminants: plutonium-240, plutonium-241, and plutonium-238. These isotopes are extremely difficult to separate, and more cost-effective ways of obtaining fissile material exist (e.g., uranium enrichment or dedicated plutonium production reactors).\nHigh-level waste is full of highly radioactive fission products, most of which are relatively short-lived. This is a concern since if the waste is stored, perhaps in deep geological storage, over many years the fission products decay, decreasing the radioactivity of the waste and making the plutonium easier to access. The undesirable contaminant Pu-240 decays faster than the Pu-239, and thus the quality of the bomb material increases with time (although its quantity decreases during that time as well). Thus, some have argued, as time passes, these deep storage areas have the potential to become \"plutonium mines\", from which material for nuclear weapons can be acquired with relatively little difficulty. Critics of the latter idea have pointed out the difficulty of recovering useful material from sealed deep storage areas makes other methods preferable. Specifically, high radioactivity and heat (80\u00a0\u00b0C in surrounding rock) greatly increase the difficulty of mining a storage area, and the enrichment methods required have high capital costs.\nPu-239 decays to U-235 which is suitable for weapons and which has a very long half-life (roughly 109 years). Thus plutonium may decay and leave uranium-235. However, modern reactors are only moderately enriched with U-235 relative to U-238, so the U-238 continues to serve as a denaturation agent for any U-235 produced by plutonium decay.\nOne solution to this problem is to recycle the plutonium and use it as a fuel e.g. in fast reactors. In pyrometallurgical fast reactors, the separated plutonium and uranium are contaminated by actinides and cannot be used for nuclear weapons.\nNuclear weapons decommissioning.\nWaste from nuclear weapons decommissioning is unlikely to contain much beta or gamma activity other than tritium and americium. It is more likely to contain alpha-emitting actinides such as Pu-239 which is a fissile material used in nuclear bombs, plus some material with much higher specific activities, such as Pu-238 or Po.\nIn the past the neutron trigger for an atomic bomb tended to be beryllium and a high activity alpha emitter such as polonium; an alternative to polonium is Pu-238. For reasons of national security, details of the design of modern nuclear bombs are normally not released to the open literature.\nSome designs might contain a radioisotope thermoelectric generator using Pu-238 to provide a long-lasting source of electrical power for the electronics in the device.\nIt is likely that the fissile material of an old nuclear bomb, which is due for refitting, will contain decay products of the plutonium isotopes used in it. These are likely to include U-236 from Pu-240 impurities plus some U-235 from decay of the Pu-239; due to the relatively long half-life of these Pu isotopes, these wastes from radioactive decay of bomb core material would be very small, and in any case, far less dangerous (even in terms of simple radioactivity) than the Pu-239 itself.\nThe beta decay of Pu-241 forms Am-241; the in-growth of americium is likely to be a greater problem than the decay of Pu-239 and Pu-240 as the americium is a gamma emitter (increasing external-exposure to workers) and is an alpha emitter which can cause the generation of heat. The plutonium could be separated from the americium by several different processes; these would include pyrochemical processes and aqueous/organic solvent extraction. A truncated PUREX type extraction process would be one possible method of making the separation. Naturally occurring uranium is not fissile because it contains 99.3% of U-238 and only 0.7% of U-235.\nLegacy waste.\nDue to historic activities typically related to the radium industry, uranium mining, and military programs, numerous sites contain or are contaminated with radioactivity. In the United States alone, the Department of Energy (DOE) states there are \"millions of gallons of radioactive waste\" as well as \"thousands of tons of spent nuclear fuel and material\" and also \"huge quantities of contaminated soil and water.\" Despite copious quantities of waste, in 2007, the DOE stated a goal of cleaning all presently contaminated sites successfully by 2025. The Fernald, Ohio site for example had \"31 million pounds of uranium product\", \"2.5 billion pounds of waste\", \"2.75 million cubic yards of contaminated soil and debris\", and a \"223 acre portion of the underlying Great Miami Aquifer had uranium levels above drinking standards.\" The United States has at least 108 sites designated as areas that are contaminated and unusable, sometimes many thousands of acres. The DOE wishes to clean or mitigate many or all by 2025, using the recently developed method of geomelting, however the task can be difficult and it acknowledges that some may never be completely remediated. In just one of these 108 larger designations, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), there were for example at least \"167 known contaminant release sites\" in one of the three subdivisions of the site. Some of the U.S. sites were smaller in nature, however, cleanup problems were simpler to address, and the DOE has successfully completed cleanup, or at least closure, of several sites.\nMedicine.\nRadioactive medical waste tends to contain beta particle and gamma ray emitters. It can be divided into two main classes. In diagnostic nuclear medicine a number of short-lived gamma emitters such as technetium-99m are used. Many of these can be disposed of by leaving it to decay for a short time before disposal as normal waste. Other isotopes used in medicine, with half-lives in parentheses, include:\nIndustry.\nIndustrial source waste can contain alpha, beta, neutron or gamma emitters. Gamma emitters are used in radiography while neutron emitting sources are used in a range of applications, such as oil well logging.\nNaturally occurring radioactive material.\nSubstances containing natural radioactivity are known as NORM (naturally occurring radioactive material). After human processing that exposes or concentrates this natural radioactivity (such as mining bringing coal to the surface or burning it to produce concentrated ash), it becomes technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive material (TENORM). Much of this waste is alpha particle-emitting matter from the decay chains of uranium and thorium. The main source of radiation in the human body is potassium-40 (40K), typically 17 milligrams in the body at a time and 0.4 milligrams/day intake. Most rocks, especially granite, have a low level of radioactivity due to the potassium-40, thorium and uranium contained.\nUsually ranging from 1 millisievert (mSv) to 13\u00a0mSv annually depending on location, average radiation exposure from natural radioisotopes is 2.0\u00a0mSv per person a year worldwide. This makes up the majority of typical total dosage (with mean annual exposure from other sources amounting to 0.6\u00a0mSv from medical tests averaged over the whole populace, 0.4\u00a0mSv from cosmic rays, 0.005\u00a0mSv from the legacy of past atmospheric nuclear testing, 0.005\u00a0mSv occupational exposure, 0.002\u00a0mSv from the Chernobyl disaster, and 0.0002\u00a0mSv from the nuclear fuel cycle).\nTENORM is not regulated as restrictively as nuclear reactor waste, though there are no significant differences in the radiological risks of these materials.\nCoal.\nCoal contains a small amount of radioactive uranium, barium, thorium, and potassium, but, in the case of pure coal, this is significantly less than the average concentration of those elements in the Earth's crust. The surrounding strata, if shale or mudstone, often contain slightly more than average and this may also be reflected in the ash content of 'dirty' coals. The more active ash minerals become concentrated in the fly ash precisely because they do not burn well. The radioactivity of fly ash is about the same as black shale and is less than phosphate rocks, but is more of a concern because a small amount of the fly ash ends up in the atmosphere where it can be inhaled. According to U.S. National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) reports, population exposure from 1000-MWe power plants amounts to 490 person-rem/year for coal power plants, 100 times as great as nuclear power plants (4.8 person-rem/year). The exposure from the complete nuclear fuel cycle from mining to waste disposal is 136 person-rem/year; the corresponding value for coal use from mining to waste disposal is \"probably unknown\".\nOil and gas.\nResidues from the oil and gas industry often contain radium and its decay products. The sulfate scale from an oil well can be radium rich, while the water, oil, and gas from a well often contain radon. The radon decays to form solid radioisotopes which form coatings on the inside of pipework. In an oil processing plant, the area of the plant where propane is processed is often one of the more contaminated areas of the plant as radon has a similar boiling point to propane.\nRadioactive elements are an industrial problem in some oil wells where workers operating in direct contact with the crude oil and brine can be exposed to doses having negative health effects. Due to the relatively high concentration of these elements in the brine, its disposal is also a technological challenge. Since the 1980s, in the United States, the brine is however exempt from the dangerous waste regulations and can be disposed of regardless of radioactive or toxic substances content.\nRare-earth mining.\nDue to natural occurrence of radioactive elements such as thorium and radium in rare-earth ore, mining operations also result in production of waste and mineral deposits that are slightly radioactive. \nClassification.\nClassification of radioactive waste varies by country. The IAEA, which publishes the Radioactive Waste Safety Standards (RADWASS), also plays a significant role. The proportion (by volume) of various types of waste generated in the UK are:\nMill tailings.\nUranium tailings are waste by-product materials left over from the rough processing of uranium-bearing ore. They are not significantly radioactive. Mill tailings are sometimes referred to as 11(e)2 wastes, from the section of the US Atomic Energy Act of 1946 that defines them. Uranium mill tailings typically also contain chemically hazardous heavy metal such as lead and arsenic. Vast mounds of uranium mill tailings are left at many old mining sites, especially in Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah.\nAlthough mill tailings are not very radioactive, they have long half-lives. Mill tailings often contain radium, thorium and trace amounts of uranium.\nLow-level waste.\nLow-level waste (LLW) is generated from hospitals and industry, as well as the nuclear fuel cycle. Low-level wastes include paper, rags, tools, clothing, filters, and other materials which contain small amounts of mostly short-lived radioactivity. Materials that originate from any region of an active area are commonly designated as LLW as a precautionary measure even if there is only a remote possibility of being contaminated with radioactive materials. Such LLW typically exhibits no higher radioactivity than one would expect from the same material disposed of in a non-active area, such as a normal office block. Example LLW includes wiping rags, mops, medical tubes, laboratory animal carcasses, and more. LLW makes up 94% of all radioactive waste volume in the UK. Most of it is disposed of in Cumbria, first in landfill style trenches, and now using grouted metal containers that are stacked in concrete vaults. A new site in the north of Scotland is the Dounreay site which is prepared to withstand a 4m tsunami.https://\nSome high-activity LLW requires shielding during handling and transport but most LLW is suitable for shallow land burial. To reduce its volume, it is often compacted or incinerated before disposal. Low-level waste is divided into four classes: \"class A\", \"class B\", \"class C\", and \"Greater Than Class C\" (\"GTCC\").\nIntermediate-level waste.\nIntermediate-level waste (ILW) contains higher amounts of radioactivity compared to low-level waste. It generally requires shielding, but not cooling. Intermediate-level wastes includes resins, chemical sludge and metal nuclear fuel cladding, as well as contaminated materials from reactor decommissioning. It may be solidified in concrete or bitumen or mixed with silica sand and vitrified for disposal. As a general rule, short-lived waste (mainly non-fuel materials from reactors) is buried in shallow repositories, while long-lived waste (from fuel and fuel reprocessing) is deposited in geological repository. Regulations in the United States do not define this category of waste; the term is used in Europe and elsewhere. ILW makes up 6% of all radioactive waste volume in the UK.\nHigh-level waste.\nHigh-level waste (HLW) is produced by nuclear reactors and the reprocessing of nuclear fuel. The exact definition of HLW differs internationally. After a nuclear fuel rod serves one fuel cycle and is removed from the core, it is considered HLW. Spent fuel rods contain mostly uranium with fission products and transuranic elements generated in the reactor core. Spent fuel is highly radioactive and often hot. HLW accounts for over 95% of the total radioactivity produced in the process of nuclear electricity generation but it contributes to less than 1% of volume of all radioactive waste produced in the UK. Overall, the 60-year-long nuclear program in the UK up until 2019 produced 2150\u00a0m3 of HLW.\nThe radioactive waste from spent fuel rods consists primarily of cesium-137 and strontium-90, but it may also include plutonium, which can be considered transuranic waste. The half-lives of these radioactive elements can differ quite extremely. Some elements, such as cesium-137 and strontium-90 have half-lives of approximately 30 years. Meanwhile, plutonium has a half-life that can stretch to as long as 24,000 years.\nThe amount of HLW worldwide is increasing by about 12,000 tonnes per year. A 1000-megawatt nuclear power plant produces about 27 tonnes of spent nuclear fuel (unreprocessed) every year. For comparison, the amount of ash produced by coal power plants in the United States is estimated at 130,000,000 t per year and fly ash is estimated to release 100 times more radiation than an equivalent nuclear power plant.\nIn 2010, it was estimated that about 250,000 t of nuclear HLW were stored globally. This does not include amounts that have escaped into the environment from accidents or tests. Japan is estimated to hold 17,000 t of HLW in storage in 2015. As of 2019, the United States has over 90,000 t of HLW. HLW have been shipped to other countries to be stored or reprocessed and, in some cases, shipped back as active fuel.\nThe ongoing controversy over high-level radioactive waste disposal is a major constraint on nuclear power global expansion. Most scientists agree that the main proposed long-term solution is deep geological burial, either in a mine or a deep borehole. As of 2019, no dedicated civilian high-level nuclear waste site is operational as small amounts of HLW did not justify the investment in the past. Finland is in the advanced stage of the construction of the Onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository, which is planned to open in 2025 at 400\u2013450 m depth. France is in the planning phase for a 500 m deep Cigeo facility in Bure. Sweden is planning a site in Forsmark. Canada plans a 680 m deep facility near Lake Huron in Ontario. The Republic of Korea plans to open a site around 2028. The site in Sweden enjoys 80% support from local residents as of 2020.\nThe Morris Operation in Grundy County, Illinois, is currently the only \"de facto\" high-level radioactive waste storage site in the United States.\nTransuranic waste.\nTransuranic waste (TRUW) as defined by U.S. regulations is, without regard to form or origin, waste that is contaminated with alpha-emitting transuranic radionuclides with half-lives greater than 20 years and concentrations greater than 100\u00a0nCi/g (3.7\u00a0MBq/kg), excluding high-level waste. Elements that have an atomic number greater than uranium are called transuranic (\"beyond uranium\"). Because of their long half-lives, TRUW is disposed of more cautiously than either low- or intermediate-level waste. In the United States, it arises mainly from nuclear weapons production, and consists of clothing, tools, rags, residues, debris, and other items contaminated with small amounts of radioactive elements (mainly plutonium).\nUnder U.S. law, transuranic waste is further categorized into \"contact-handled\" (CH) and \"remote-handled\" (RH) on the basis of the radiation dose rate measured at the surface of the waste container. CH TRUW has a surface dose rate not greater than 200 mrem per hour (2\u00a0mSv/h), whereas RH TRUW has a surface dose rate of 200\u00a0mrem/h (2\u00a0mSv/h) or greater. CH TRUW does not have the very high radioactivity of high-level waste, nor its high heat generation, but RH TRUW can be highly radioactive, with surface dose rates up to 1,000,000\u00a0mrem/h (10,000\u00a0mSv/h). The United States currently disposes of TRUW generated from military facilities at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in a deep salt formation in New Mexico.\nPrevention.\nA future way to reduce waste accumulation is to phase out current reactors in favor of Generation IV reactors, which output less waste per power generated. Fast reactors such as BN-800 in Russia are also able to consume MOX fuel that is manufactured from recycled spent fuel from traditional reactors.\nThe UK's Nuclear Decommissioning Authority published a position paper in 2014 on the progress on approaches to the management of separated plutonium, which summarises the conclusions of the work that the NDA shared with the UK government.\nManagement.\nOf particular concern in nuclear waste management are two long-lived fission products, Tc-99 (half-life 220,000 years) and I-129 (half-life 15.7 million years), which dominate spent fuel radioactivity after a few thousand years. The most troublesome transuranic elements in spent fuel are Np-237 (half-life two million years) and Pu-239 (half-life 24,000 years). Nuclear waste requires sophisticated treatment and management to successfully isolate it from interacting with the biosphere. This usually necessitates treatment, followed by a long-term management strategy involving storage, disposal or transformation of the waste into a non-toxic form. Governments around the world are considering a range of waste management and disposal options, though there has been limited progress toward long-term waste management solutions.\nSeveral methods of disposal of radioactive waste have been investigated:\nIn the United States, waste management policy broke down with the ending of work on the incomplete Yucca Mountain Repository. At present there are 70 nuclear power plant sites where spent fuel is stored. A Blue Ribbon Commission was appointed by U.S. President Obama to look into future options for this and future waste. A deep geological repository seems to be favored.\nDucrete, Saltcrete, and Synroc are methods for immobilizing nuclear waste.\nMaritime transport of radioactive waste on ships is regulated at sea by the INF Code.\nInitial treatment.\nVitrification.\nLong-term storage of radioactive waste requires the stabilization of the waste into a form that will neither react nor degrade for extended periods. It is theorized that one way to do this might be through vitrification. Currently at Sellafield, the high-level waste (PUREX first cycle raffinate) is mixed with sugar and then calcined. Calcination involves passing the waste through a heated, rotating tube. The purposes of calcination are to evaporate the water from the waste and de-nitrate the fission products to assist the stability of the glass produced.\nThe 'calcine' generated is fed continuously into an induction heated furnace with fragmented glass. The resulting glass is a new substance in which the waste products are bonded into the glass matrix when it solidifies. As a melt, this product is poured into stainless steel cylindrical containers (\"cylinders\") in a batch process. When cooled, the fluid solidifies (\"vitrifies\") into the glass. After being formed, the glass is highly resistant to water.\nAfter filling a cylinder, a seal is welded onto the cylinder head. The cylinder is then washed. After being inspected for external contamination, the steel cylinder is stored, usually in an underground repository. In this form, the waste products are expected to be immobilized for thousands of years.\nThe glass inside a cylinder is usually a black glossy substance. All this work (in the United Kingdom) is done using hot cell systems. Sugar is added to control the ruthenium chemistry and to stop the formation of the volatile RuO4 containing radioactive ruthenium isotopes. In the West, the glass is normally a borosilicate glass (similar to Pyrex), while in the former Soviet Union it is normal to use a phosphate glass. The amount of fission products in the glass must be limited because some (palladium, the other Pt group metals, and tellurium) tend to form metallic phases which separate from the glass. Bulk vitrification uses electrodes to melt soil and wastes, which are then buried underground. In Germany, a vitrification plant is treating the waste from a small demonstration reprocessing plant which has since been closed.\nPhosphate ceramics.\nAnother way to stabilize the waste into a form that will not react or degrade for extended periods is immobilization via direct incorporation into a phosphate-based crystalline ceramic host. The diverse chemistry of phosphate ceramics under various conditions demonstrates a versatile material that can withstand chemical, thermal, and radioactive degradation over time. The properties of phosphates, particularly ceramic phosphates, of stability over a wide pH range, low porosity, and minimization of secondary waste introduces possibilities for new waste immobilization techniques.\nIon exchange.\nIt is common for medium active wastes in the nuclear industry to be treated with ion exchange or other means to concentrate the radioactivity into a small volume. The much less radioactive bulk (after treatment) is often then discharged. For instance, it is possible to use a ferric hydroxide floc to remove radioactive metals from aqueous mixtures. After the radioisotopes are absorbed onto the ferric hydroxide, the resulting sludge can be placed in a metal drum before being mixed with cement to form solid waste. In order to get better long-term performance (mechanical stability) from such forms, they may be made from a mixture of fly ash, or blast furnace slag, and portland cement, instead of normal concrete (made with portland cement, gravel and sand).\nSynroc.\nThe Australian Synroc (synthetic rock) is a more sophisticated way to immobilize such waste, and this process may eventually come into commercial use for civil wastes (it is currently being developed for U.S. military wastes). Synroc was invented by Ted Ringwood, a geochemist at the Australian National University. The Synroc contains pyrochlore and cryptomelane type minerals. The original form of Synroc (Synroc C) was designed for the liquid high-level waste (PUREX raffinate) from a light-water reactor. The main minerals in this Synroc are hollandite (BaAl2Ti6O16), zirconolite (CaZrTi2O7) and perovskite (CaTiO3). The zirconolite and perovskite are hosts for the actinides. The strontium and barium will be fixed in the perovskite. The caesium will be fixed in the hollandite. A Synroc waste treatment facility began construction in 2018 at ANSTO.\nLong-term management.\nThe time frame in question when dealing with radioactive waste ranges from 10,000 to 1,000,000 years, according to studies based on the effect of estimated radiation doses. Researchers suggest that forecasts of health detriment for such periods should be examined critically. Practical studies only consider up to 100 years as far as effective planning and cost evaluations are concerned. Long term behavior of radioactive wastes remains a subject for ongoing research projects in geoforecasting.\nRemediation.\nAlgae has shown selectivity for strontium in studies, where most plants used in bioremediation have not shown selectivity between calcium and strontium, often becoming saturated with calcium, which is present in greater quantities in nuclear waste. Strontium-90 with a half-life around 30 years, is classified as high-level waste.\nResearchers have looked at the bioaccumulation of strontium by \"Scenedesmus spinosus\" (algae) in simulated wastewater. The study claims a highly selective biosorption capacity for strontium of S. spinosus, suggesting that it may be appropriate for use of nuclear wastewater. A study of the pond alga \"Closterium moniliferum\" using non-radioactive strontium found that varying the ratio of barium to strontium in water improved strontium selectivity.\nAbove-ground disposal.\nDry cask storage typically involves taking waste from a spent fuel pool and sealing it (along with an inert gas) in a steel cylinder, which is placed in a concrete cylinder which acts as a radiation shield. It is a relatively inexpensive method which can be done at a central facility or adjacent to the source reactor. The waste can be easily retrieved for reprocessing.\nGeologic disposal.\nThe process of selecting appropriate deep final repositories for high-level waste and spent fuel is now underway in several countries with the first expected to be commissioned sometime after 2010. The basic concept is to locate a large, stable geologic formation and use mining technology to excavate a tunnel, or use large-bore tunnel boring machines (similar to those used to drill the Channel Tunnel from England to France) to drill a shaft below the surface where rooms or vaults can be excavated for disposal of high-level radioactive waste. The goal is to permanently isolate nuclear waste from the human environment. Many people remain uncomfortable with the immediate stewardship cessation of this disposal system, suggesting perpetual management and monitoring would be more prudent.\nBecause some radioactive species have half-lives longer than one million years, even very low container leakage and radionuclide migration rates must be taken into account. Moreover, it may require more than one half-life until some nuclear materials lose enough radioactivity to cease being lethal to living things. A 1983 review of the Swedish radioactive waste disposal program by the National Academy of Sciences found that country's estimate of several hundred thousand years\u2014perhaps up to one million years\u2014being necessary for waste isolation \"fully justified.\"\nThe proposed land-based subductive waste disposal method disposes of nuclear waste in a subduction zone accessed from land and therefore is not prohibited by international agreement. This method has been described as the most viable means of disposing of radioactive waste, and as the state-of-the-art as of 2001 in nuclear waste disposal technology.\nAnother approach termed Remix &amp; Return would blend high-level waste with uranium mine and mill tailings down to the level of the original radioactivity of the uranium ore, then replace it in inactive uranium mines. This approach has the merits of providing jobs for miners who would double as disposal staff, and of facilitating a cradle-to-grave cycle for radioactive materials, but would be inappropriate for spent reactor fuel in the absence of reprocessing, due to the presence of highly toxic radioactive elements such as plutonium within it.\nDeep borehole disposal is the concept of disposing of high-level radioactive waste from nuclear reactors in extremely deep boreholes. Deep borehole disposal seeks to place the waste as much as beneath the surface of the Earth and relies primarily on the immense natural geological barrier to confine the waste safely and permanently so that it should never pose a threat to the environment. The Earth's crust contains 120 trillion tons of thorium and 40 trillion tons of uranium (primarily at relatively trace concentrations of parts per million each adding up over the crust's 3 \u00d7 1019 ton mass), among other natural radioisotopes. Since the fraction of nuclides decaying per unit of time is inversely proportional to an isotope's half-life, the relative radioactivity of the lesser amount of human-produced radioisotopes (thousands of tons instead of trillions of tons) would diminish once the isotopes with far shorter half-lives than the bulk of natural radioisotopes decayed.\nIn January 2013, Cumbria county council rejected UK central government proposals to start work on an underground storage dump for nuclear waste near to the Lake District National Park. \"For any host community, there will be a substantial community benefits package and worth hundreds of millions of pounds\" said Ed Davey, Energy Secretary, but nonetheless, the local elected body voted 7\u20133 against research continuing, after hearing evidence from independent geologists that \"the fractured strata of the county was impossible to entrust with such dangerous material and a hazard lasting millennia.\"\nHorizontal drillhole disposal describes proposals to drill over one km vertically, and two km horizontally in the earth's crust, for the purpose of disposing of high-level waste forms such as spent nuclear fuel, Caesium-137, or Strontium-90. After the emplacement and the retrievability period, drillholes would be backfilled and sealed. A series of tests of the technology were carried out in November 2018 and then again publicly in January 2019 by a U.S. based private company. The test demonstrated the emplacement of a test-canister in a horizontal drillhole and retrieval of the same canister. There was no actual high-level waste used in the test.\nThe European Commission Joint Research Centre report of 2021 (see above) concluded:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Management of radioactive waste and its safe and secure disposal is a necessary step in the lifecycle of all applications of nuclear science and technology (nuclear energy, research, industry, education, medical, and others). Radioactive waste is therefore generated in practically every country, the largest contribution coming from the nuclear energy lifecycle in countries operating nuclear power plants. Presently, there is broad scientific and technical consensus that disposal of high-level, long-lived radioactive waste in deep geologic formations is, at the state of today\u2019s knowledge, considered as an appropriate and safe means of isolating it from the biosphere for very long time scales.\nOcean floor disposal.\nFrom 1946 through 1993, thirteen countries used ocean disposal or ocean dumping as a method to dispose of nuclear/radioactive waste with an approximation of 200,000 tons sourcing mainly from the medical, research and nuclear industry.\nOcean floor disposal of radioactive waste has been suggested by the finding that deep waters in the North Atlantic Ocean do not present an exchange with shallow waters for about 140 years based on oxygen content data recorded over a period of 25 years. They include burial beneath a stable abyssal plain, burial in a subduction zone that would slowly carry the waste downward into the Earth's mantle, and burial beneath a remote natural or human-made island. While these approaches all have merit and would facilitate an international solution to the problem of disposal of radioactive waste, they would require an amendment of the Law of the Sea.\nNuclear submarines have been lost and these vessels reactors must also be counted in the amount of radioactive waste deposited at sea.\nArticle 1 (Definitions), 7., of the 1996 Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, (the London Dumping Convention) states:\n\"\"Sea\" means all marine waters other than the internal waters of States, as well as the seabed and the subsoil thereof; it does not include sub-seabed repositories accessed only from land.\"\nTransmutation.\nThere have been proposals for reactors that consume nuclear waste and transmute it to other, less-harmful or shorter-lived, nuclear waste. In particular, the integral fast reactor was a proposed nuclear reactor with a nuclear fuel cycle that produced no transuranic waste and, in fact, could consume transuranic waste. It proceeded as far as large-scale tests but was eventually canceled by the U.S. Government. Another approach, considered safer but requiring more development, is to dedicate subcritical reactors to the transmutation of the left-over transuranic elements.\nAn isotope that is found in nuclear waste and that represents a concern in terms of proliferation is Pu-239. The large stock of plutonium is a result of its production inside uranium-fueled reactors and of the reprocessing of weapons-grade plutonium during the weapons program. An option for getting rid of this plutonium is to use it as a fuel in a traditional light-water reactors (LWR). Several fuel types with differing plutonium destruction efficiencies are under study.\nTransmutation was banned in the United States in April 1977 by U. S. President Carter due to the danger of plutonium proliferation, but President Reagan rescinded the ban in 1981. Due to economic losses and risks, the construction of reprocessing plants during this time did not resume. Due to high energy demand, work on the method has continued in the European Union (EU). This has resulted in a practical nuclear research reactor called Myrrha in which transmutation is possible. Additionally, a new research program called ACTINET has been started in the EU to make transmutation possible on an industrial scale. According to U. S. President Bush's Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) of 2007, the United States is actively promoting research on transmutation technologies needed to markedly reduce the problem of nuclear waste treatment.\nThere have also been theoretical studies involving the use of fusion reactors as so-called \"actinide burners\" where a fusion reactor plasma such as in a tokamak, could be \"doped\" with a small amount of the \"minor\" transuranic atoms which would be transmuted (meaning fissioned in the actinide case) to lighter elements upon their successive bombardment by the very high energy neutrons produced by the fusion of deuterium and tritium in the reactor. A study at MIT found that only 2 or 3 fusion reactors with parameters similar to that of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) could transmute the entire annual minor actinide production from all of the light-water reactors presently operating in the United States fleet while simultaneously generating approximately 1 gigawatt of power from each reactor.\n2018 Nobel Prize for Physics-winner G\u00e9rard Mourou has proposed using chirped pulse amplification to generate high-energy and low-duration laser pulses either to accelerate deuterons into a tritium target causing fusion events yielding fast neutrons, or accelerating protons for neutron spallation, with either method intended for transmutation of nuclear waste.\nRe-use.\nSpent nuclear fuel contains abundant fertile uranium and traces of fissile materials. Methods such as the PUREX process can be used to remove useful actinides for the production of active nuclear fuel.\nAnother option is to find applications for the isotopes in nuclear waste so as to re-use them. Already, caesium-137, strontium-90 and a few other isotopes are extracted for certain industrial applications such as food irradiation and radioisotope thermoelectric generators. While re-use does not eliminate the need to manage radioisotopes, it can reduce the quantity of waste produced.\nThe Nuclear Assisted Hydrocarbon Production Method, Canadian patent application 2,659,302, is a method for the temporary or permanent storage of nuclear waste materials comprising the placing of waste materials into one or more repositories or boreholes constructed into an unconventional oil formation. The thermal flux of the waste materials fractures the formation and alters the chemical and/or physical properties of hydrocarbon material within the subterranean formation to allow removal of the altered material. A mixture of hydrocarbons, hydrogen, and/or other formation fluids is produced from the formation. The radioactivity of high-level radioactive waste affords proliferation resistance to plutonium placed in the periphery of the repository or the deepest portion of a borehole.\nBreeder reactors can run on U-238 and transuranic elements, which comprise the majority of spent fuel radioactivity in the 1,000\u2013100,000-year time span.\nSpace disposal.\nSpace disposal is attractive because it removes nuclear waste from the planet. It has significant disadvantages, such as the potential for catastrophic failure of a launch vehicle, which could spread radioactive material into the atmosphere and around the world. A high number of launches would be required because no individual rocket would be able to carry very much of the material relative to the total amount that needs to be disposed. This makes the proposal economically impractical and increases the risk of one or more launch failures. To further complicate matters, international agreements on the regulation of such a program would need to be established. Costs and inadequate reliability of modern rocket launch systems for space disposal has been one of the motives for interest in non-rocket spacelaunch systems such as mass drivers, space elevators, and other proposals.\nNational management plans.\nSweden and Finland are furthest along in committing to a particular disposal technology, while many others reprocess spent fuel or contract with France or Great Britain to do it, taking back the resulting plutonium and high-level waste. \"An increasing backlog of plutonium from reprocessing is developing in many countries... It is doubtful that reprocessing makes economic sense in the present environment of cheap uranium.\"\nIn many European countries (e.g., Britain, Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland) the risk or dose limit for a member of the public exposed to radiation from a future high-level nuclear waste facility is considerably more stringent than that suggested by the International Commission on Radiation Protection or proposed in the United States. European limits are often more stringent than the standard suggested in 1990 by the International Commission on Radiation Protection by a factor of 20, and more stringent by a factor of ten than the standard proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository for the first 10,000 years after closure.\nThe U.S. EPA's proposed standard for greater than 10,000 years is 250 times more permissive than the European limit. The U.S. EPA proposed a legal limit of a maximum of 3.5 millisieverts (350 millirem) each annually to local individuals after 10,000 years, which would be up to several percent of the exposure currently received by some populations in the highest natural background regions on Earth, though the United States Department of Energy (DOE) predicted that received dose would be much below that limit. Over a timeframe of thousands of years, after the most active short half-life radioisotopes decayed, burying U.S. nuclear waste would increase the radioactivity in the top 2000 feet of rock and soil in the United States (10 million km2) by approximately 1 part in 10 million over the cumulative amount of natural radioisotopes in such a volume, but the vicinity of the site would have a far higher concentration of artificial radioisotopes underground than such an average.\nMongolia.\nAfter serious opposition about plans and negotiations between Mongolia with Japan and the United States to build nuclear-waste facilities in Mongolia, Mongolia stopped all negotiations in September 2011. These negotiations had started after U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy Daniel Poneman visited Mongolia in September 2010. Talks took place in Washington, D.C. between officials of Japan, the United States, and Mongolia in February 2011. After this the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which wanted to buy nuclear fuel from Mongolia, joined in the negotiations. The talks were kept secret and, although the \"Mainichi Daily News\" reported on them in May, Mongolia officially denied the existence of these negotiations. Alarmed by this news, Mongolian citizens protested against the plans and demanded the government withdraw the plans and disclose information. The Mongolian President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj issued a presidential order on September 13 banning all negotiations with foreign governments or international organizations on nuclear-waste storage plans in Mongolia. The Mongolian government has accused the newspaper of distributing false claims around the world. After the presidential order, the Mongolian president fired the individual who was supposedly involved in these conversations.\nIllegal dumping.\nAuthorities in Italy are investigating a 'Ndrangheta mafia clan accused of trafficking and illegally dumping nuclear waste. According to a whistleblower, a manager of the Italy state energy research agency Enea paid the clan to get rid of 600 drums of toxic and radioactive waste from Italy, Switzerland, France, Germany, and the United States, with Somalia as the destination, where the waste was buried after buying off local politicians. Former employees of Enea are suspected of paying the criminals to take waste off their hands in the 1980s and 1990s. Shipments to Somalia continued into the 1990s, while the 'Ndrangheta clan also blew up shiploads of waste, including radioactive hospital waste, sending them to the sea bed off the Calabrian coast. According to the environmental group Legambiente, former members of the 'Ndrangheta have said that they were paid to sink ships with radioactive material for the last 20 years.\nIn 2008, Afghan authorities accused Pakistan of illegally dumping nuclear waste in the southern parts of Afghanistan when the Taliban were in power between 1996 and 2001. The Pakistani government denied the allegation.\nAccidents.\nA few incidents have occurred when radioactive material was disposed of improperly, shielding during transport was defective, or when it was simply abandoned or even stolen from a waste store. In the Soviet Union, waste stored in Lake Karachay was blown over the area during a dust storm after the lake had partly dried out. In Italy, several radioactive waste deposits let material flow into river water, thus contaminating water for domestic use. In France in the summer of 2008, numerous incidents happened: in one, at the Areva plant in Tricastin, it was reported that, during a draining operation, liquid containing untreated uranium overflowed out of a faulty tank and about 75\u00a0kg of the radioactive material seeped into the ground and, from there, into two rivers nearby; in another case, over 100 staff were contaminated with low doses of radiation. There are ongoing concerns around the deterioration of the nuclear waste site on the Enewetak Atoll of the Marshall Islands and a potential radioactive spill.\nScavenging of abandoned radioactive material has been the cause of several other cases of radiation exposure, mostly in developing nations, which may have less regulation of dangerous substances (and sometimes less general education about radioactivity and its hazards) and a market for scavenged goods and scrap metal. The scavengers and those who buy the material are almost always unaware that the material is radioactive and it is selected for its aesthetics or scrap value. Irresponsibility on the part of the radioactive material's owners, usually a hospital, university, or military, and the absence of regulation concerning radioactive waste, or a lack of enforcement of such regulations, have been significant factors in radiation exposures. For an example of an accident involving radioactive scrap originating from a hospital, see the Goi\u00e2nia accident.\nTransportation accidents involving spent nuclear fuel from power plants are unlikely to have serious consequences due to the strength of the spent nuclear fuel shipping casks.\nOn 15 December 2011, top government spokesman Osamu Fujimura of the Japanese government admitted that nuclear substances were found in the waste of Japanese nuclear facilities. Although Japan did commit itself in 1977 to inspections in the safeguard agreement with the IAEA, the reports were kept secret for the inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Japan did start discussions with the IAEA about the large quantities of enriched uranium and plutonium that were discovered in nuclear waste cleared away by Japanese nuclear operators. At the press conference Fujimura said: \"Based on investigations so far, most nuclear substances have been properly managed as waste, and from that perspective, there is no problem in safety management,\" but according to him, the matter was at that moment still being investigated.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37258", "revid": "44967271", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37258", "title": "Carol II of Romania", "text": "King of Romania from 1930 to 1940\nCarol II (15 October 1893 [O.S. 3 October 1893] \u2013 4 April 1953) was King of Romania from 8 June 1930 following a coup that deposed his son until his forced abdication on 6 September 1940. As the eldest son of King Ferdinand I, he was crown prince from the death of his granduncle, King Carol I, in 1914 until he was forced to renounce his right to the throne in 1925.\nCarol's life and reign were surrounded by controversy, such as his desertion from the army during World War I. Another controversy was his marriage to Zizi Lambrino, who was not from a royal lineage. After the dissolution of his first marriage, he met Princess Helen of Greece and Denmark, daughter of King Constantine I of Greece, married her in March 1921, and later that year, they had a son, Michael. Due to his continued extramarital affair with Elena Lupescu, Carol was forced to renounce his succession rights in 1925. His father removed Carol from the royal house of Romania and he was exiled to France along with Lupescu. Michael, aged 5, inherited the throne on the death of King Ferdinand in 1927. Princess Helen divorced Carol in 1928.\nIn the political crisis resulting from the deaths of King Ferdinand and the prime minister and the ineffective regency of Prince Nicholas of Romania, Miron Cristea, and Gheorghe Buzdugan, Carol was allowed to return to Romania in 1930. His name was restored by the royal house of Romania, and he deposed his son and claimed the throne as Carol II. The beginning of his reign was marked by the negative economic effects of the Great Depression. He weakened the parliament of Romania, often appointing minority factions of historical parties to the government and attempting to form nationally concentrated governments, such as the Iorga-Argetoianu government. He surrounded himself with a corrupt circle of advisors, which included Lupescu. Another political crisis followed the December 1937 elections, in which no party achieved an absolute majority and a coalition could not be formed because of disagreements between the various political factions. Following this crisis, Carol established a royal dictatorship in 1938 by suspending the 1923 constitution, abolishing all political parties, and forming a single new political party which consisted mostly of former members of the National Peasants' Party and the National Christian Party who he had patronized. The National Renaissance Front was the last of several attempts to counter the popularity of the fascist Iron Guard.\nAt the outbreak of World War II, Carol reaffirmed the Polish\u2013Romanian alliance. Poland, which wished to follow the Romanian Bridgehead plan, declined Romanian military assistance. Following the fall of Poland and the involvement of the Soviet Union, Carol maintained a neutrality policy. After the fall of France, he shifted his policy in favor of re-alignment with Nazi Germany in hopes of gaining a guarantee that Germany would not invade Romania. The year 1940 marked the fragmentation of Greater Romania by the seceding of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union, Northern Transylvania to Hungary and Southern Dobruja to Bulgaria. Although a German guarantee had been achieved, the cost destroyed Carol's reputation, his regime collapsed and he was forced to abdicate by General Ion Antonescu, the newly appointed and Nazi-backed prime minister. He was succeeded by his son Michael. After his abdication, Carol was permitted to leave the country with a train loaded with 30 truckloads of his personal fortune, which he had acquired during his time as king. In a failed attempt to assassinate Carol, the Iron Guard shot at the train as it was passing through Timi\u0219oara station. After World War II, Carol II wanted to regain the throne but was stopped by the Western Allies. For the rest of his life, he traveled the world, finally marrying Lupescu while living in Brazil in 1947. After settling in the Portuguese Riviera, Carol II died peacefully at the age of 59 in exile. His son Michael I refused to attend his funeral out of disgust for the treatment of his mother, Princess Helen by his father.\nEarly life.\nCarol was born in Pele\u0219 Castle and grew up under the thumb of his dominating grand-uncle, King Carol I. King Carol I largely excluded Carol's parents, the German-born Crown Prince Ferdinand and the British-born Crown Princess Marie, from any role in raising him. Romania in the early 20th century had a famously relaxed \"Latin\" sexual morality, and the British Princess Marie of Edinburgh had a long series of affairs with various Romanian men with whom she could obtain more emotional and sexual satisfaction than with Ferdinand, who fiercely resented being cuckolded. The stern Carol I felt that Marie was unqualified to raise Prince Carol because of her affairs and her young age, as she was only seventeen when Carol was born, while Marie regarded the King as a cold, overbearing tyrant who would crush the life out of her son.\nThe childless Carol I, who had always wanted a son, treated Prince Carol as his surrogate son and thoroughly spoiled him, indulging his every whim. Ferdinand was a rather shy and weak man who was easily overshadowed by the charismatic Marie, who became the most loved member of the Romanian royal family. Growing up, Carol felt ashamed of his father, whom both his grand-uncle and mother pushed around. Carol as a child was caught in an emotional tug-of-war between Carol I and Marie, who had very different ideas about how to raise him. The Romanian historian Marie Bucur described the battle between Carol I and Princess Marie as one between traditional 19th-century Prussian conservatism as personified by Carol I versus the 20th-century liberal, modernist, and sexually deviant values of the \"New Woman\" as personified by Princess Marie. Aspects of both Marie's and Carol I's personalities were present in Carol II. Largely because of the battle between the King and Marie, Carol ended up being both spoiled and deprived of love. \nEarly marriages and love affairs.\nDuring his teenage years, Carol (Romanian for \"Charles\") acquired the \"playboy\" image that was to become his defining persona for the rest of his life. Carol expressed some concern at the direction that Prince Carol was taking, as the young Prince's only serious interest was stamp collecting and he spent an inordinate amount of time drinking, partying, and chasing after women. Young Carol fathered at least two illegitimate children by the teenage schoolgirl Maria Martini by the time that he was 19. Carol rapidly became a favorite of gossip columnists around the world owing to the frequent photographs that appeared in the newspapers showing him at various parties with him holding a drink in one hand and a woman in the other.\nIn order to teach the prince the value of Prussian virtues, the King had the prince commissioned as an officer in 1913. His time with the 1st Prussian Guards regiment did not achieve the desired results, and Carol remained the \"playboy prince\". Romania in the early 20th century was an intensely Francophile nation, indeed perhaps the most Francophile nation in the entire world as the Romanian elite obsessively went about embracing all things French as the model for perfection in everything. To a certain extent, Carol was influenced by the prevailing Francophilia, but at the same time, he inherited from Carol I, in the words of the American historian Margaret Sankey, a \"profound love of German militarism\" and the idea that all democratic governments were weak governments.\nSometime before the First World War, the Romanian and Russian royal families held talks about the marriage of Carol, at that time the heir to the throne of the Kingdom of Romania, to the Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia, the eldest daughter of the Russian emperor at the time, Tsar Nicholas II: Sergey Sazonov, the Foreign Minister of the Russian Empire between 1910 and 1916, wanted Olga to marry Carol to ensure Romania's position as an ally of Russia in the eventuality of a war, as Romania was an ally of Germany at the time. Both royal families, including the Tsar and his wife Alexandra, gave their support for the idea, and there were high expectations that the marriage would take place. However, neither Carol or Olga demonstrated an interest for the other: Carol wasn't fond of Olga's appearance, and Olga expressed her wish to remain in Russia (should the marriage have taken place, Olga would have become the Crown Princess, and later the Queen of Romania). This was best seen during the visit of the Romanian royal family to Russia in March, 1914, and during a visit of Nicholas and his family to Romania a few months later.\nAfter the failure of the planned joining of Carol and Olga, the idea of a possible marriage of a Romanian royal to a Russian royal faded until 1917, when Carol began showing interest in the younger sister of Olga, the Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna. In a visit to Russia in January of that year, he made a formal proposal to Nicholas for Maria's hand, but Nicholas \"good-naturedly laughed the proposal aside\", and argued that Maria \"was nothing more than a schoolgirl\". Maria was only 17 at the time, and shared her older sister's desire to marry a Russian and remain in Russia.\nIn November 1914, Carol joined the Romanian Senate, as the 1866 Constitution guaranteed him a seat there upon reaching maturity. Known more for his romantic misadventures than for any leadership skills, Carol was first married in the Cathedral Church of Odesa, Ukraine, on August 31, 1918 (under the occupation of the Central Powers at that time), to Joanna Marie Valentina Lambrino (1898\u20131953), known as \"Zizi\", the daughter of a Romanian general, Constantin Lambrino. The fact that Carol technically had deserted as he left his post at the Army without permission to marry Zizi Lambrino caused immense controversy at the time. The marriage was annulled on March 29, 1919, by the Ilfov County Court. Carol and Zizi continued to live together after the annulment. Their only child, Mircea Gregor Carol Lambrino, was born on 8 January 1920.\nCarol next married Princess Helen of Greece and Denmark, who was known in Romania as Crown Princess Elena, on 10 March, 1921, in Athens, Greece. They were second cousins, both of them great-grandchildren of Queen Victoria, as well as third cousins in descent from Nicholas I of Russia. Helen had known of Carol's dissolute behavior and previous marriage, but her love for him was undeterred. The intent behind this arranged marriage was to help organize a dynastic alliance between Greece and Romania. Bulgaria had territorial disputes with Greece, Romania, and Yugoslavia, and all three of the latter states tended to be close during the interwar period owing to their shared fears of the Bulgarians. Helen and Carol's only child, Michael, was born seven months after their marriage, sparking rumors that Michael was conceived out of wedlock. Apparently close at first, Carol and Helen drifted apart. Carol's marriage with Princess Helen was an unhappy one, and he frequently engaged in extramarital affairs. The elegant wallflower Helen found the bohemian Carol, with his love of heavy drinking and constant partying, rather too wild for her tastes. For his part, Carol disliked royal and aristocratic women, whom he found too stiff and formal, and had an extremely marked preference for commoners, much to the chagrin of his parents. Carol found low-born women to have the qualities that he sought in a woman, such as informality, spontaneity, humor, and passion.\nControversies surrounding Magda Lupescu.\nThe marriage soon collapsed in the wake of Carol's affair with Elena (Magda) Lupescu (1895\u20131977), the Roman Catholic daughter of Jewish parents who had converted to Christianity. Magda Lupescu had formerly been the wife of Army officer Ion T\u00e2mpeanu. The National Liberal Party, which dominated Romania's politics, made much of Carol's relationship with Lupescu argue that he was unqualified to be king. One of the leading figures of the National Liberals was Prince Barbu \u0218tirbey \u2013 who was also Queen Marie's lover, and Carol had a strong dislike of \u0218tirbey, who had humiliated his father via his indiscreetly disguised relationship with Marie, and hence of the National Liberals. Knowing that Carol was ill-disposed towards them, the National Liberals waged a sustained campaign to keep him from the throne. The campaign waged by the National Liberals had less to do with disgust with Carol's relationship with Madame Lupescu than with an effort to remove a potential \"loose cannon\", as Carol made it clear when he succeeded to the throne that he would not be content to let the National Liberals dominate politics in the way that the previous Hohenzollern kings had.\nAs a result of the scandal, Carol renounced his right to the throne on December 28, 1925, in favor of his son by Crown Princess Helen, Michael I (Mihai), who became king in July 1927 upon the death of his paternal grandfather, King Ferdinand I. Helen divorced Carol in 1928. After renouncing his right to the throne, Carol moved to Paris, where he lived openly in a common-law relationship with Madame Lupescu. The National Liberal Party was largely a vehicle for the powerful Br\u0103tianu family to exercise power and, after the National Liberal prime minister Ion I. C. Br\u0103tianu died in 1927, the Br\u0103tianu's were unable to agree upon a successor, causing the fortunes of the National Liberals to go into decline. In the 1928 elections, the National Peasant Party under Iuliu Maniu won a resounding victory, taking 78% of the vote. As Prince Nicolae, the chief of the Regency Council that governed for King Michael, was known to be friendly with the National Liberals, the new prime minister was determined to dispose of the regency council by bringing back Carol.\nUsurpation of the throne.\nReturning to the country on 7 June, 1930, in a coup d'\u00e9tat engineered by National Peasant Prime Minister Iuliu Maniu, Carol deposed his son Michael (who was still under a regency due to his minority) and was recognized by the Parliament as king of Romania the following day. For the next decade, he sought to influence the course of Romanian political life, first through manipulation of the rival Peasant and Liberal parties and anti-Semitic factions, and subsequently (January 1938) through a ministry of his own choosing. Carol also sought to build up his own personality cult against the growing influence of the Iron Guard, for instance, by setting up a paramilitary youth organization known as \"Straja \u021a\u0103rii\" in 1935. The American historian Stanley G. Payne described Carol as \"the most cynical, corrupt and power-hungry monarch who ever disgraced a throne anywhere in twentieth-century Europe\". A colorful character, Carol was in the words of the British historian Richard Cavendish: \"Dashing, willful and reckless, a lover of women, champagne and speed, Carol drove racing cars and piloted planes, and on state occasions, occasions appeared in operetta uniforms with enough ribbons, chains, and orders to sink a small destroyer.\"\nThe Romanian historian Maria Bucur wrote about Carol:\nOf course, he loved luxury; being born to privilege he expected nothing less than the grand lifestyle he saw in the other courts of Europe. Yet his style was not outlandish or grotesque like Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu's unique brand of kitsch. He liked things large but relatively simple \u2013 his royal palace testifies to that trait. Carol\u2019s true passions were Lupescu, hunting, and cars and he spared no expense on them.\nCarol liked to present an impressive and populist persona to the public, wearing garish military uniforms adorned with medals, and being the benefactor of every philanthropic endeavor in the country. He loved parades and grandiose festivals and watched them closely, but he was not taken in by these events as more than shows of his power. He did not take them as a show of sincere popularity as Ceau\u0219escu did during his later years.\nCarol had sworn in his coronation an oath to uphold the constitution of 1923, a promise he had no intention of keeping, and right from the start of his reign, the king meddled in politics to increase his own power. Carol was an opportunist with no real principles or values other than the belief that he was the right man to rule Romania and that what his kingdom needed was a modernizing dictatorship. Carol ruled via an informal body known as the \"camarilla\", comprising courtiers together with senior diplomats, army officers, politicians, and industrialists, who were all in some way dependent upon royal favor to advance their careers. The most important member of the \"camarilla\" was Carol's mistress, Madame Lupescu, whose political advice Carol greatly valued. Maniu had brought Carol to the throne out of the fear that the regency for Michael I was dominated by National Liberals, who would ensure that their party would always win the elections. Madame Lupescu was deeply unpopular with the Romanian people, and Maniu had demanded that Carol return to his wife, Princess Helen of Greece, as part of the price for being given the throne. When Carol broke his own word and continued to live with Madame Lupescu, Maniu resigned in protest in October 1930 and was to emerge as one of Carol's leading enemies. At the same time, Carol's return had prompted a break in the National Liberals with Gheorghe I. Br\u0103tianu breaking away to found a new party, the National Liberal Party-Br\u0103tianu that was willing to work with the new king. Despite his dislike of the National Liberals, Maniu's enmity towards Carol left the king with no choice, but to enlist as his allies the break-away factions of the National Liberals against the National Peasants, who demanded that Carol banish Lupescu and return to his wife.\nThe \"Red Queen,\" as Lupescu was known to the Romanian people on account of the color of her hair, was the most hated woman in 1930s Romania. She was a woman whom ordinary Romanians saw as \"the embodiment of evil,\" in the words of the British historian Rebecca Haynes. Princess Helen was widely viewed as the wronged woman, while Lupescu was seen as the \"femme fatale\" who had stolen Carol away from the loving arms of Helen. Lupescu was Roman Catholic, but because of her parents' background, she was widely viewed as Jewish. Lupescu's personality did not win her many friends, as she was arrogant, pushy, manipulative, and extremely greedy, with an insatiable taste for buying the most expensive French clothes, cosmetics, and jewelry. At a time when many Romanians were suffering from the Great Depression in Romania, Carol's habit of indulging Lupescu's expensive tastes caused much resentment, with many of Carol's subjects grumbling that the money would have been better spent on alleviating poverty in the kingdom. Further adding to Lupescu's immense unpopularity, she was a businesswoman who used her connections to the Crown to engage in dubious transactions that usually involved large sums of public money \u2013 going into her pocket. However, the contemporary viewpoint that Carol was a mere puppet of Lupescu is incorrect, and Lupescu's influence on political decision-making was much exaggerated at the time. Lupescu was primarily interested in enriching herself to support her extravagant lifestyle and had no real interest in politics, beyond protecting her ability to engage in corruption. Unlike Carol, Lupescu had utterly no interest in social policy or foreign affairs and was such a self-absorbed narcissist that she was unaware of just how unpopular she was with ordinary people. Carol by contrast was interested in the affairs of the state, and though he never sought to deny his relationship with Lupescu, he was careful not to display her too much in public, as he knew that this would bring him unpopularity.\nCarol sought to play the National Liberals, the National Peasant Party, and the Iron Guard off against each other with the ultimate aim of making himself master of Romanian politics and disposing of all the parties in Romania. With regards to the Legion of the Archangel Michael, Carol had no intention of ever letting the Iron Guard come to power, but insofar as the Legion was a disruptive force that weakened both the National Liberals and the National Peasants, Carol welcomed the rise of the Iron Guard in the early 1930s, and he sought to use the Legion for his own ends. On December 29, 1933, the Iron Guard assassinated the National Liberal prime minister, Ion G. Duca, which led to the first of several bans placed on the Legion. The assassination of Ion Duca, which was Romania's first political murder since 1862, shocked Carol, who saw the willingness of Codreanu to order the assassination of the Prime Minister as a clear sign that the egomaniacal Codreanu was getting out of control and that Codreanu would not play the role assigned by the king as a disruptive force threatening the National Liberals and National Peasants alike. In 1934, when Codreanu was brought to trial for ordering Duca's assassination, he used as his defense the argument that the entire Francophile elite was completely corrupt and not properly Romanian, and as such, Duca was just another corrupt National Liberal politician who deserved to die. The jury acquitted Codreanu, an act that worried Carol as it showed that Codreanu's revolutionary message that the entire elite needed to be destroyed was winning popular approval. In the spring of 1934, after Codreanu was acquitted, Carol, together with Bucharest police prefect Gavril\u0103 Marinescu and Madame Lupescu, were involved in a half-hearted plot to kill Codreanu by poisoning his coffee, an effort that was abandoned before being attempted. Until 1935, Carol was a leading contributor to the \"Friends of the Legion\", the group that collected contributions to the Legion. Carol only stopped contributing to the Legion after Codreanu started calling Lupescu a \"Jewish whore\". Carol's image was always that of \"the playboy king\", a hedonistic monarch more interested in womanizing, drinking, gambling, and partying, than in affairs of state, and to the extent that he cared about politics, Carol was viewed as a scheming, dishonest man only interested in wrecking the democratic system to seize power for himself.\nPersonality cult.\nTo compensate for his rather negative and well-deserved \"playboy king\" image, Carol created a lavish personality cult around himself that grew more extreme as his reign went on, which portrayed the king as a Christ-like being \"chosen\" by God to create a \"new Romania\". In the 1934 book \"The Three Kings\" by Cezar Petrescu, which was intended for a less educated audience, Carol was constantly described as being almost god-like, the \"father of the villagers and workers of the land\" and the \"king of culture\" who was the greatest of all the Hohenzollern kings and whose return from exile from France via airplane in June 1930 was a \"descent from the heavens\". Petrescu depicted Carol's return as the beginning of his God-appointed task of becoming \"the maker of eternal Romania\", the start of a glorious golden age as Petrescu asserted that rule by monarchs was what God wanted for Romanians.\nCarol had little understanding of or interest in economics, but his most influential economic advisor was Mihail Manoilescu who favored a statist model of economic development with the state intervening in the economy to encourage growth. Carol was very active in the cultural realm, being a generous patron of the arts and actively supporting the work of the Royal Foundation, an organization with a broad mandate to promote and study Romanian culture in all fields. In particular, Carol supported the work of the sociologist Dimitrie Gusti of the Social Service of the Royal Foundation, who in the early 1930s started to bring social scientists from various disciplines like sociology, anthropology, ethnography, geography, musicology, medicine, and biology together in a \"science of the nation\". Gusti took teams of professors from various disciplines to the countryside to study an entire community from all vantage points every summer, who then produce a lengthy report about the community.\nPolitical influence.\nFor most of the interwar period, Romania was in the French sphere of influence, and in June 1926, a defensive alliance was signed with France. The alliance with France, together with an alliance with Poland signed in 1921, and the \"Little Entente,\" which united Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia, were the cornerstones of Romanian foreign policy. Starting in 1919, the French sought to create the \"Cordon sanitaire\" that would keep both Germany and the Soviet Union out of Eastern Europe. Carol did not seek to replace the foreign policy he had inherited in 1930 at first, as he regarded the continuation of the \"cordon sanitaire\" as the best guarantee of Romania's independence and territorial integrity, and as such, his foreign policy was essentially pro-French. At the time that Romania signed the alliance with France, the Rhineland region of Germany was demilitarized, and the thinking in Bucharest had always been that if Germany should commit any act of aggression anywhere in Eastern Europe, the French would begin an offensive into the \"Reich\". Starting in 1930, when the French began to build the Maginot Line along their border with Germany, some doubts started to be expressed in Bucharest about whether the French might actually come to Romania's aid in the event of a German aggression. In 1933, Carol had Nicolae Titulescu, an outspoken champion of collective security under the banner of the League of Nations, appointed foreign minister with instructions to use principles of collective security as the building blocks for creating some sort of security structure intended to keep both Germany and the Soviet Union out of Eastern Europe. Carol and Titulescu personally disliked one another, but Carol wanted Titulescu as a foreign minister as he believed he was the best man for strengthening ties with France and for bringing Great Britain into the affairs of Eastern Europe under the guise of the collective security commitments contained the League Covenant.\nThe process of \"Gleichschaltung\" (coordination) in National Socialist Germany did not extend only to the \"Reich but\" was rather thought of by the National Socialist leadership as a worldwide process in which the NSDAP would take control over all of the ethnic German communities around the entire world. The Foreign Policy Department of the NSDAP, headed by Alfred Rosenberg, had attempted to take over the \"Volk Deutsch\" (ethnic German) community in Romania starting in 1934, a policy that greatly offended Carol, who regarded this as outrageous German interference in Romania's internal affairs. As Romania had half a million \"Volk Deutsch\" citizens in the 1930s, the Nazi campaign to take over the German community in Romania was a real concern for Carol, who feared that the German minority might become a fifth column. In addition, Rosenberg's agents had established contracts with the Romanian extreme right, most notably with the National Christian Party headed by Octavian Goga and less substantial links with the Iron Guard headed by Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, which further annoyed Carol. The American historian Gerhard Weinberg wrote about Carol's foreign policy views: \"He admired and feared Germany, but feared and disliked the Soviet Union.\". The fact that the first leader to visit Nazi Germany (albeit not in an official capacity) was the Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula G\u00f6mb\u00f6s, who during his visit to Berlin in October 1933 signed an economic treaty that placed Hungary within the German economic sphere of influence \u2013 was a source of much alarm to Carol. For the entire interwar period, Budapest refused to recognize the frontiers imposed by the Treaty of Trianon and laid claim to Transylvania region of Romania. Carol, like the rest of the Romanian elite, was worried by the prospect of an alliance of the revisionist states that rejected the legitimacy of the international order created by the Allies in 1918\u201320, indicating that Germany would support Hungary's claims to Transylvania. Hungary had territorial disputes with Romania, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia, all of which happened to be allies of France. Accordingly, Franco\u2013Hungarian relations were extremely bad during the interwar period, and so \u2013 it seemed natural that Hungary would ally itself with France's archenemy, Germany.\nIn 1934, Titulescu played a leading role in creating the Balkan Entente which brought together Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey in an alliance intended to counter Bulgarian revanchism. The Balkan Entente was intended to be the beginning of an alliance that would bring together all of the anti-revisionist states of Eastern Europe. Like France, Romania was allied to both Czechoslovakia and Poland, but because of the Teschen dispute in Silesia, Warsaw and Prague were bitter enemies. Like the diplomats of the Quai d'Orsay, Carol was exasperated by the bitter Polish-Czechoslovak dispute, arguing that it was absurd for anti-revisionist Eastern European states to be feuding with one another in the face of the rise of German and Soviet powers. Several times, Carol attempted to mediate the Teschen dispute and thus end the Polish-Czechoslovak feud without much success. Reflecting his initially pro-French orientation, in June 1934, when the French foreign minister Louis Barthou visited Bucharest to meet with the foreign ministers of \"the Little Entente\" of Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia, Carol organized lavish celebrations to welcome Barthou that were made to symbolize the enduring Franco-Romanian friendship between the two \"Latin sisters.\". The German minister to Romania, Count Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg complained with disgust in a report to Berlin that everyone in the Romanian elite was an incurable Francophile who told him that Romania would never betray its \"Latin sister\" France.\nAt the same time, Carol also considered the possibility that if Romanian-German relations were improved, then perhaps Berlin could be persuaded not to support Budapest in its campaign to regain Transylvania. Further pressing Carol towards Germany was the desperate state of the Romanian economy: even before the worldwide Great Depression, Romania had been a poor country, and the Great Depression hit Romania hard, with Romanians being unable to export much owing to the global trade war set off by the American Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which in turn led to a decline in the value of the \"Leu\" as Romania's reserves of foreign exchange were being used up. In June 1934, Romanian finance minister Victor Sl\u0103vescu visited Paris to ask the French to inject millions of francs into the Romanian treasury and to lower their tariffs on Romanian goods. When the French refused both requests, an annoyed Carol wrote in his diary that the \"Latin sister\" France was behaving in a less than sisterly way towards Romania. In April 1936, when Wilhelm Fabricius was appointed German minister in Bucharest, the Foreign Minister Baron Konstantin von Neurath in his instructions to the new minister, described Romania as an unfriendly, pro-French state but suggested that the prospect of more trade with the \"Reich\" might bring the Romanians out of the French orbit. Neurath further instructed Fabricius that while Romania was not a major power in a military sense, it was a state of crucial importance to Germany because of its oil.\nCarol often encouraged splits in the political parties to his own ends. In 1935, Alexandru Vaida-Voevod, the leader of the Transylvanian branch of the National Peasants, broke away to form the Romanian Front with Carol's encouragement. During the same time, Carol developed close contacts with Armand C\u0103linescu, an ambitious National Peasant leader who founded a faction opposed to the leadership of Carol's archenemy, Iuliu Maniu, and wanted the National Peasants to work with the Crown. In the same way, Carol encouraged the \"Young Liberal\" faction headed by Gheorghe T\u0103t\u0103rescu as a way of weakening the power of the Br\u0103tianu family, who dominated the National Liberals. Pointedly, Carol was willing to allow the \"Young Liberal\" faction under T\u0103t\u0103rescu to come to power, but excluded the main National Liberal faction under the leadership of Dinu Br\u0103tianu from obtaining power; Carol had not forgotten how the Br\u0103tianus had excluded him from the succession in the 1920s.\nIn February 1935, the Legion's leader, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, who until then had been regarded as an ally of Carol, for the first time attacked the king directly when he organized demonstrations outside of the royal palace attacking Carol after Dr. Dimitrie Gerota had been imprisoned for writing an article exposing the corrupt business dealings of Lupescu. Codreanu, in his speech before the Royal Palace called Lupescu a \"Jewish whore\" who was robbing Romania blind, which led to an insulted Carol calling on one of the members of his \"camarilla\", the Bucharest police prefect Gavril\u0103 Marinescu, who sent the police out to break up the Iron Guard rally with much violence.\nThe doubts about the French willingness to undertake an offensive against Germany were further reinforced by the Remilitarization of the Rhineland in March 1936, which had the effect of allowing the Germans to start building the Siegfried line along the border with France, something that considerably lessened the prospect of a French offensive into western Germany if the \"Reich\" should invade any of the states of the \"cordon sanitaire\". A British Foreign Office memo from March 1936 stated that the only nations in the world that would apply sanctions on Germany for remilitarizing the Rhineland if the League of Nations should vote for such a step were Britain, France, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, and Romania. In the aftermath of the remilitarization of the Rhineland, and once it was clear that no sanctions were going to be applied against Germany, Carol started to voice his fears that the days of French influence in Eastern Europe were numbered and Romania might have to seek some understanding with Germany to preserve its independence. After continuing the alliance with France, Carol also began a policy of attempting to improve relations with Germany.\nOn the domestic front, in the summer of 1936, Codreanu and Maniu formed an alliance to oppose the growing power of the Crown and the National Liberal government. In August 1936, Carol had Titulescu fired as foreign minister, and in November 1936, Carol sent the renegade National Liberal politician Gheorghe I. Br\u0103tianu to Germany to meet with Adolf Hitler, the Foreign Minister Baron Konstantin von Neurath and Hermann G\u00f6ring to tell them of Romania's desire for a rapprochement with the \"Reich\". Carol was much relieved when Br\u0103tianu reported that Hitler, Neurath, and G\u00f6ring had all reassured him that the \"Reich\" had no interest in supporting Hungarian revanchism and was neutral on the Transylvania dispute. The decoupling of Berlin's campaign to overthrow the international system created by the Treaty of Versailles from Budapest's campaign to overthrow the system created by the Treaty of Trianon was welcome news to Carol, creating the possibility that a greater Germany would not mean a greater Hungary. G\u00f6ring, the newly appointed chief of the Four Year Plan organization designed to have Germany ready to wage a total war by 1940, was especially interested in Romania's oil and talked much to Br\u0103tianu about a new era of German-Romanian economic relations. Germany had almost no oil of its own, and throughout the Third Reich, control of Romania's oil was a key foreign policy goal. Reflecting the changed emphasis, Carol vetoed in February 1937 a plan promoted by France and Czechoslovakia for a new alliance that would formally unite France with the Little Entente and envisioned much closer military ties between the French and their allies in Eastern Europe. Because of its oil, the French were keen to keep the alliance with Romania strong, and because Romania's manpower was a way of compensating the French for their lower population vs. Germany's (the French had 40 million people while Germany had 70 million people). Additionally, it was assumed in Paris that if Germany invaded Czechoslovakia Hungary would also attack Czechoslovakia to regain Slovakia and Ruthenia. French military planners envisioned the role of Romania and Yugoslavia in such a war as invading Hungary to relieve the pressure on Czechoslovakia.\nUntil 1940, Carol's foreign policy teetered uneasily between the traditional alliance with France and an alignment with the newly ascending power of Germany. In the summer of 1937, Carol told French diplomats that if Germany attacked Czechoslovakia, he would not allow the Red Army transit rights across Romania but was willing to ignore the Soviets if they crossed Romanian airspace on their way to Czechoslovakia. On December 9, 1937, a German-Romanian economic treaty was signed that placed Romania within the German economic sphere of influence but left the Germans unsatisfied as the \"Reich\"'s enormous demand for oil to power its increasingly large war machine, was not yet fulfilled by the 1937 treaty. Germany had a tremendous need for oil and no sooner had the 1937 agreement been signed than the Germans asked for a new economic treaty in 1938. At the same time that the German-Romanian treaty was signed in December 1937, Carol was receiving the French Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos to show that the alliance with France was not yet dead.\nThe 1937 election and the Goga government.\nIn September 1937, Carol paid an extended visit to Paris, during which he indicated to the French Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos that Romanian democracy would soon end. In a campaign speech for the general elections due that December, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, \"Captain\" of the Archangel Michael Legion, called for an end to the alliance with France and stated: \"I am for a Romanian foreign policy with Rome and Berlin. I am with the states of the National Revolution against Bolshevism. Within forty-eight hours of a Legionary movement victory, Romania will have an alliance with Rome and Berlin\". Without realizing it, Codreanu had sealed his doom with that speech. Carol had always insisted that control of foreign policy was his own exclusive royal prerogative, which no one else was allowed to interfere with. Despite the constitution, which stated that the foreign minister was responsible to the prime minister, in practice, the foreign ministers had always reported to the king. By challenging Carol's right to control foreign policy, Codreanu had crossed the Rubicon in the king's eyes and from that time on, Carol was committed to the destruction of the arrogant upstart Codreanu and his movement who had dared to challenge the king's prerogative. In the December 1937 elections, the National Liberal government of Prime Minister Gheorghe T\u0103t\u0103rescu won the largest number of seats, but less than the 40% required to form a majority government in parliament. After assassinating Prime Minister Duca in 1933, the Iron Guard had been banned from participating in elections, and to get around the ban Codreanu founded the All for Fatherland! party as a front for the Legion. The All for Fatherland! the party won 16% of the vote in the 1937 election, marking the high point of the Iron Guard's electoral success.\nOn 28, 1937, Carol swore in the radical anti-Semitic poet Octavian Goga of the National Christian Party, which only won 9% of the vote, as prime minister. Carol's reasons for appointing Goga Prime Minister were partly because he hoped that anti-Semitic policies Goga would bring in would win him support from the All for Fatherland! voters and thus weaken the Legion and partly because he hoped that Goga would prove so incompetent as prime minister as to provoke such a crisis that would allow him to seize power for himself. Carol wrote in his diary that the markedly stupid Goga could not possibly last long as prime minister and that Goga's failure would allow him to \"be free to take stronger measures which will free me and the country from the tyranny of party interests\". Carol agreed to Goga's request to dissolve parliament for new elections on 18, 1938. As leader of the fourth party in parliament, Goga's government was certain to be defeated on a vote of no-confidence when parliament convened as the National Liberals, National Peasants and All for the Fatherland Party had all come out against Goga, albeit for very different reasons. The election got off to a violent start with a brawl in Bucharest between Goga's \"L\u0103ncieri\" paramilitary group and the Iron Guard that left two dead, 52 hospitalized and 450 people arrested. The 1938 election was one of the most violent elections in Romanian history, as the Iron Guard and \"L\u0103ncieri\" battled one another for control of the streets while seeking to establish their anti-Semitic creditations by assaulting Jews. As Parliament never met during the Goga government, Goga had to pass laws via emergency decree, which all had to be countersigned by the king.\nThe harsh anti-Semitic policies of the Goga government impoverished the Jewish minority and led to immediate complaints from the British, French and American governments that Goga's policies were going to lead to a Jewish exodus out of Romania. Neither Britain, France, nor the United States had any wish to take in the Jewish refugees that Goga was creating by imposing increasingly oppressive anti-Semitic laws, and all three governments pressed for Carol to dismiss Goga as a way of nipping the developing humanitarian crisis caused by Goga in the bud. The British minister Sir Reginald Hoare and French minister Adrien Thierry both submitted notes of protest against the Goga government's anti-Semitism, while President Roosevelt of the United States wrote a letter to Carol complaining about the anti-Semitic policies he was tolerating. On 12, 1938, Goga stripped all Romanian Jews of their Romanian citizenship, a preparatory move towards Goga's ultimate goal of the expulsion of all Romanian Jews. Carol was personally not an anti-Semite, but in the words of his biographer, Paul D. Quinlan, the king was \"simply indifferent\" to the sufferings of his Jewish subjects caused by Goga's oppressive anti-Semitic laws. The opportunistic Carol did not believe in antisemitism anymore than he believed in anything else other than power, but if \"raison d'\u00e9tat\" meant tolerating an anti-Semitic government as the price of gaining power, Carol was quite prepared to sacrifice the rights of his Jewish subjects. At the same time, Goga proved himself a better poet than politician, and there was a crisis atmosphere in early 1938 as the Goga government, which obsessed with solving the \"Jewish Question\", to the exclusion of everything else, was clearly floundering. Weinberg wrote about Goga, saying that he was \"Unprepared for office and untouched by any leadership ability...\" and whose clownish antics left diplomats stationed in Bucharest \"half-amused, half-appalled\". As Carol had expected, Goga proved to be such an inept leader as to discredit democracy while his anti-Semitic policies ensured that none of the democratic great powers would object to Carol proclaiming a dictatorship.\nThe Royal Dictatorship.\nComing to realize belatedly that he was being used by Carol, Goga had a meeting with Codreanu on 8 February 1938, at the house of Ion Gigurtu to arrange for a deal under which the Iron Guard would withdraw its candidates from the election in order to ensure that the radical anti-Semitic right would have a majority. Carol quickly learned of the Goga-Codreanu pact and used it as the justification for the self-coup he had been planning since late 1937. On 10 February 1938, Carol suspended the Constitution and seized emergency powers. Carol proclaimed martial law and suspended all civil liberties under the grounds that the violent election campaign was at the risk of plunging the nation into civil war.\nHaving outlived his usefulness, Goga was sacked as prime minister and Carol appointed Patriarch Elie Cristea, the head of the Romanian Eastern Orthodox Church, as his successor. Carol knew he would command wide respect in a country where the majority of the population was Orthodox. On 11, 1938, Carol drafted a new constitution. Although it was superficially similar to its 1923 predecessor, it was actually a severely authoritarian and corporatist document. The new constitution effectively codified the emergency powers Carol had seized in February, turning his government into a de facto legal dictatorship. It concentrated virtually all governing power in his hands, almost to the point of absolute monarchy. The new constitution was approved in a plebiscite held under far-from-secret conditions; voters were required to appear before an election bureau and verbally state whether they approved the constitution; silence was deemed as a \"yes\" vote. Under these conditions, an implausible 99.87 percent were reported as having approved the new charter, against fewer than 5,500 votes against it.\nAt the time of his coup in February 1938, Carol informed the German minister Wilhelm Fabricius of his wish for closer ties between his country and Germany. Thierry told Carol in a meeting after the coup that his new government was \"well received\" in Paris and that the French would not allow the end of democracy to affect their relations with Romania. The new government of Patriarch Cristea did not introduce new anti-Semitic laws but did not repeal the laws passed by Goga either, though Cristea was less extreme about enforcing these laws. When asked by a Jewish friend if his citizenship would be restored now that Goga was gone, Interior Minister Armand C\u0103linescu, who detested the Iron Guard and antisemitism, replied that the Cristea government had no interest in restoring citizenship back to the Jews.\nIn March 1938, Armand C\u0103linescu, the Interior Minister who had emerged as one of Carol's closet allies and who was to serve as the \"strong man\" of the new regime, demanded the Iron Guard be finally destroyed. In April 1938, Carol moved to crush the Iron Guard by having Codreanu imprisoned for libeling the historian Nicolae Iorga after Codreanu had published a public letter accusing Iorga of dishonest business dealings. After Codreanu's conviction on 19 April 1938, he was convicted again in a second trial on 27 May 1938, of high treason where he was accused of working in the pay of Germany to affect a revolution since 1935 and sentenced to 10 years in prison.\nCarol was made a Stranger Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter in 1938 (the 982nd member since the order's inception) by his second cousin, George VI (King of the United Kingdom). In 1937, he was awarded the Grand Cross of Justice of the Military and Hospitaler Order of Saint Lazarus of Jerusalem and given the Grand Collar of the Order on 16 October 1938. He served as the Grand Bailiwick of the budding Grand Bailiwick of Romania.\nCarol, together with the rest of the Romanian elite, was deeply shocked by the Munich Agreement of 30 September 1938, which he saw as allowing all of Eastern Europe to fall within the German sphere of influence. Romania had long been one of the most Francophile nations in the world, which meant that the effects of Munich were felt especially strongly there. Weinberg wrote about the effect of Munich on Franco-Romanian relations: \"In view of the traditional ties going back to the beginnings of Romanian independence and manifested in the way in which the Romanian elite looked to France as the model for everything from fashion to government, the revelation of France's abdication was particularly shocking.\" In October 1938, the Iron Guard had begun a terrorist campaign of assassinating police officers and bureaucrats and staging bombings of government offices as part of an effort to overthrow Carol. Carol struck back hard, ordering the police to arrest Iron Guardsmen without warrant and to summarily execute those found with weapons.\nIn view of Germany's desperate need for oil and the repeated German requests for a new economic agreement that would allow for more Romanian oil to be shipped to the \"Reich\", Carol met Fabricius to tell him that he wanted such an agreement to create a lasting understanding between Germany and Romania. At the same time, in October\u2013November 1938, Carol was playing a double game and appealed to Britain for help, offering to place Romania within the British economic sphere of influence, and visited London between 15 and 20 November to hold unsuccessful talks on that subject. On 24 November 1938, Carol visited Germany to meet with Hitler in order to improve German-Romanian relations. During the talks for the new German-Romanian economic agreement, which was signed on 10 December 1938, Weinberg wrote that \"Carol made the needed concessions, but he demonstrated his concern for his country's independence by driving a very hard bargain.\". The British historian D.C. Watt wrote that Carol had a \"trump card\" in his control of the oil Germany needed so badly and that the Germans were willing to pay a very high price for Romanian oil, without which their military could not function. During his summit with Hitler, Carol was much offended when Hitler demanded that Carol free Codreanu and appoint him prime minister. Carol believed that as long as Codreanu lived, there was a possible alternative leadership in Romania for Hitler to back, and that if this possibility was eliminated then Hitler would have no choice other than to deal with him.\nCarol had initially planned to keep Codreanu in prison, but after the terrorist campaign began in October 1938, Carol agreed to C\u0103linescu's plan drawn up in the spring to murder all of the Iron Guard leaders in custody. On the night of 30 November 1938, Carol had Codreanu and 13 other Iron Guard leaders murdered, with the official story being that they were \"shot while trying to escape.\". The killings on the night of 30 November 1938, which saw much of the Iron Guard's leadership wiped out, have gone down in Romanian history as \"the night of the vampires.\". The Germans were much offended by the murder of Codreanu and for a period in late 1938 waged a violent propaganda campaign against Carol, with German newspapers regularly running stories casting doubt about the official version of events that Codreanu had been \"shot while trying to escape\" while calling Codreanu's murder \"a victory for the Jews,\" but ultimately economic concerns, especially the German need for Romanian oil caused the Nazis to get over their outrage over the killings of the Iron Guard leaders by early 1939, and relations with Carol soon went back to normal.\nIn December 1938, the National Renaissance Front was formed as the country's only legal party. That same month, Carol appointed his friend since childhood and another member of the \"camarilla,\" Grigore Gafencu as foreign minister. Gafencu was appointed foreign minister partly because Carol knew he could trust Gafencu and partly because of Gafencu's friendship with Colonel J\u00f3zef Beck, the Polish foreign minister, as Carol wanted to strengthen ties with Poland. Gafencu was to prove himself something of an opportunist as foreign minister, the man who always wanted to take the path of least resistance, in marked contrast to Armand C\u0103linescu, the tough, \"almost freakish-looking,\" diminutive, one-eyed Interior Minister (and soon to be prime minister) who proved himself a consistent opponent of fascism both in Romania and abroad and encouraged Carol to stand with the Allies. \nCarol's foreign policy going into 1939 was to strengthen Romania's alliances with Poland and the Balkan Entente, work to avoid conflicts with Romania's enemies Hungary and Bulgaria, and encourage Britain and France to get involved in the Balkans while trying to avoid giving offense to Germany. On 6 March 1939, the Patriarch Cristea died and was replaced as prime minister by C\u0103linescu.\nIn February 1939, G\u00f6ring dispatched his deputy Helmuth Wohlthat of the Four Year Plan organization to Bucharest with instructions to sign yet another German-Romanian economic treaty that would allow Germany total economic dominance over Romania, especially its oil industry. That Wohlthat, the number two man in the Four-Year Plan organization, was sent to Bucharest indicated the importance of the German-Romanian talks. Carol had resisted German demands for more oil in the December 1938 agreement and instead had succeeded by early 1939 in placing Romania to a certain extent within the British economic sphere of influence. To counterbalance the increasingly powerful German influence in the Balkans, Carol wanted closer ties with Britain. At the same time, the Four-Year Plan was running into major difficulties by early 1939, and in particular, G\u00f6ring's plans to have synthetic oil plants that would make oil from coal were well behind schedule. The new technology of making synthetic oil from lignite coal had run into major technical problems and cost overruns, and G\u00f6ring had been informed in early 1939 that the synthetic oil plants whose construction had started in 1936 would not be operative by 1940 as planned. It was not until the summer of 1942 that Germany's first synthetic oil plants finally started operating. It was painfully obvious to G\u00f6ring in the first months of 1939 that the German economy would not be ready to support a total war by 1940 as the Four-Year Plan of 1936 had envisioned while at the same time his economic experts were telling him the \"Reich\" needed to import 400,000 tons of oil per month while Germany had in fact imported only 61,000 tons of oil per month in the last four months of 1938.\nIn 1938, Romania produced 6.6 million tons of crude oil, 284,000 tons of crude steel, 133,000 tons of pig iron, 510,000 tons of cement and 289,000 tons of rolled steel.\nHence Wohlthat demanded during his talks with Romanian Foreign Minister Grigore Gafencu that Romania nationalize their entire oil industry, which was henceforth controlled by a new corporation owned jointly by the German and Romanian governments, while demanding Romania \"respect German export interests\" by only selling their oil to Germany. In addition, Wohlthat demanded a host of other measures that, to all practical purposes, would have converted Romania into a German economic colony. As Carol had no intention of giving in to these demands, the talks in Bucharest went very badly. It was at this point that Carol began what became known as the \"Tilea affair\" when, on 17 March 1939, Virgil Tilea, the Romanian minister in London, burst unexpectedly into the office of the British Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax in an agitated state to announce that his country was faced with an imminent German invasion and asked Halifax for British support. At the same time, Carol mobilized five infantry corps on the Hungarian border to guard the supposed invasion. The British \"economic offensive\" in the Balkans was causing Germany very real economic pain as the British bought up Romanian oil that the Germans badly needed, hence their demands for control of the Romanian oil industry that so offended Carol. As the British believed in Tilea's claims, the \"Tilea affair\" had an immense impact on British foreign policy and led to the Chamberlain government changing from appeasement of Germany to a policy of \"containing\" the \"Reich\". Carol denied, unconvincingly, knowing anything about what Tilea was up to in London, but the British warnings to Germany against invading Romania in March 1939 led the Germans to relax their demands, and the latest German-Romanian economic treaty signed on 23 March 1939, was, in the words of Watt 'very vague\". Despite the \"Tilea affair\", Carol had decided that he would refuse to become involved in any diplomacy that would force him to decisively choose between Germany and Britain, and he would never accept any support from the Soviet Union to deter Germany.\nAs part of their new policy of seeking to \"contain\" Germany starting in March 1939, the British sought the construction of the \"peace front,\" which was to comprise at a minimum Britain, France, Poland, the Soviet Union, Turkey, Romania, Greece and Yugoslavia. For his part, Carol was obsessed with fears in the first half of 1939 that Hungary, with German support, would soon attack his kingdom. On 6 April 1939, a cabinet meeting decided that Romania would not join the \"peace front\" but would seek Anglo-French support for its independence. The same meeting decided that Romania would work to strengthen ties with other Balkan nations but would seek to prevent the Anglo-French efforts to link the security of the Balkans to the security of Poland. On April 13, 1939, the British prime minister Neville Chamberlain speaking in the House of Commons and the French Premier \u00c9douard Daladier speaking in the Chamber of Deputies, announced a joint Anglo-French \"guarantee\" of the independence of Romania and Greece. Carol promptly accepted the \"guarantee.\". On 5 May 1939, the French Marshal Maxime Weygand visited Bucharest to meet with Carol and his prime minister, Armand C\u0103linescu to discuss Romania's possible participation in the \"peace front.\". Both Carol and C\u0103linescu were supportive but evasive, saying that they would welcome having the Soviet Union fight against Germany, but would never allow the Red Army to enter Romania even if Germany should invade. Carol told Weygand: \"I do not wish to let my country be engaged in a war which would result, in a few weeks, in the destruction of its army and the occupation of its territory...We do not wish to be the lighting conductor for the coming storm\". Carol went on to complain that he had enough equipment for only two-thirds of his army, which also lacked tanks, anti-aircraft guns, heavy artillery and anti-tank guns while his air force had only about 400 antiquated aircraft of French manufacture that were no match for latest German aircraft. Weygand reported to Paris that Carol wanted Anglo\u2013French support, but would not fight for the Allies if war came.\nOn 11 May 1939, an Anglo-Romanian agreement was signed under which Britain committed itself to grant Romania a credit of \u00a35 million pound sterling and promised to buy 200,000 tons of Romanian wheat at above-market prices. When Yugoslavia reacted negatively to the Anglo-Turkish Declaration of 12 May 1939, promising to \"ensure the establishment of security in the Balkans\" and threatening to pull out of the Balkan Pact, Gafencu had a summit with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Aleksandar Cincar-Markovi\u0107 on 21 May 1939, at the Iron Gates to ask the Yugoslavs to stay in the Balkan Pact. However, Cincar-Markovi\u0107's talk of leaving the Balkan Pact turned out to be a ploy by the Yugoslav Regent, Prince Paul, who was backing a plan mooted by the Turkish Foreign Minister \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc Saraco\u011flu to have Bulgaria join the Balkan Pact in exchange for Romania ceding part of the Dobruja region. In a letter to Carol, Paul stated that he wanted the Bulgarians \"off my back\" as he was afraid of the Italians building up their forces in their new colony of Albania and asked his friend to make this concession for him. Carol stated in response that it was out of the question for him to cede any territory to Bulgarians, partly because he was against giving any of his realm on principle and partly because to cede the Dobrudja would only encourage the Hungarians to renew their claims on Transylvania.\nDespite his formal opposition to joining the \"peace front,\" Carol did decide to strengthen the Balkan Entente, especially to strengthen ties with Turkey. Since Britain and France were working for an alliance with Turkey while at the same time holding talks with the Soviet Union, Carol reasoned that if Romania was to be firmly allied to Turkey, this would be a way of associating Romania with the emerging \"peace front\" without actually joining it. Despite the way in which Carol disappointed Paul, he very much wanted to strengthen Yugoslav-Romanian relations as Yugoslavia was one of Romania's few friendly neighbors. He was awarded the Yugoslav Order of Kara\u0111or\u0111e's Star. To resist Bulgarian claims on the Dubrujda, Carol also wanted better relations with Bulgaria's archenemy, Greece.\nIn July 1939, Carol had a major clash with Fritz Fabritius, the leader of the Nazified German National Party, which was the largest of the \"Volk Deutsch\" parties and which joined the National Renaissance Front in January 1939. Fabritius had taken to calling himself the \"F\u00fchrer\", had formed two paramilitary groups, the National Workers Front and the German Youth, and was holding ceremonies in which members of Romania's 800,000 strong German minority had to swear personal oaths of loyalty to him. In early July, Fabritius, during a visit to Munich, gave a speech in which he stated that the Romanian \"Volk Deutsch\" were loyal to Germany, not Romania, and spoke of his wish to see a \"Greater German \"Reich,\"\" which would be secured by armed peasant settlements along the Carpathians, Ural, and Caucasus mountains. In this \"Grossraum\" (a German word meaning roughly \"greater space\"), only Germans would be allowed to live, and those not willing to be Germanized would have to leave. In response to this speech, when Fabritius returned to Romania, he was summoned to a meeting with C\u0103linescu on 13 July, who told him that the king was going to take action against him. Fabritius promised to behave, but was expelled from Romania shortly afterwards when one of his staffers accidentally left on a train a briefcase full of documents showing Fabritius's supporters were arming themselves and that \"F\u00fchrer\" Fabritius was being financed by Germany.\nIn July 1939, Carol heard rumors that Hungary, supported by Germany, was planning on invading Romania following a new crisis in Romanian-Hungarian relations caused by complaints from Budapest that the Romanians were mistreating the Magyar minority in Transylvania (which were supported by Berlin). The king then ordered a general mobilization of his military forces while departing in the royal yacht for Istanbul. During his unexpected trip to Istanbul, Carol held talks with the Turkish President \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc and the Turkish Foreign Minister \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc Saraco\u011flu during which the Turks promised him that Turkey would immediately mobilize its military in the event of an Axis attack on Romania. The Turks, in their turn, pressed Carol to sign an alliance with the Soviet Union, something that Carol said very reluctantly he might do if the Turks were to serve as the middlemen and if the Soviets were to promise to recognize the border with Romania. The show of Romanian resolve, supported by Turkey had the effect of causing the Hungarians to back off on their demands against Romania.\nCarol, who had sought to play off both sides against each other, was alarmed when learned about the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact in August 1939. Carol allowed C\u0103linescu to tell Thierry that the Romanians would destroy their oil fields if the Axis invaded, while Gafencu told the German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop of his firm friendship with Germany, his opposition to the \"peace front,\" and his desire to sell more oil to the Germans. After the German-Soviet non-aggression pact was signed, C\u0103linescu advised Carol: \"Germany is the real danger. An alliance with it is tantamount to a protectorate. Only Germany's defeat by France and Britain can ward off the danger.\". On 27 August 1939, Gafencu told Fabricius that Romania would declare neutrality if Germany invaded Poland and that he wanted to sell to Germany some 450,000 tons of oil per month in exchange for 1.5 million \"Reichsmark\" and several modern German aircraft. Carol met with the German air force attach\u00e9 on 28 August 1939 to congratulate the Germans on the great diplomatic success they had achieved in signing the non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union. The German\u2013Soviet pact was a blessing for Carol since Germany now had access to Soviet oil, which reduced the pressure on Romania. However, unknown to Carol, the pact contained \"secret protocols\" which assigned the Romanian region of Bessarabia to the Soviet Union.\nWorld War II.\nWhen World War II began with German-Soviet Invasion of Poland in September 1939, Carol proclaimed neutrality. In doing so, Carol technically violated the letter of the treaty of alliance with Poland signed in 1921 and the spirit of treaty of alliance signed with France in 1926. Carol justified his policy under the grounds that, with Germany and the Soviet Union allied in the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop pact of August 1939 and France holding its forces behind the Maginot line, unwilling to start an offensive into Germany, that neutrality was his only hope of preserving his kingdom's independence. For its part, the Polish government was more interested in weapon deliveries from its Western allies through Romanian ports, but this became insignificant following Poland's defeat on the battlefield. As usual with Carol, he sought to play a careful balancing act between the Allies and the Axis, on one hand signing a new economic treaty with Germany while on the other hand allowing for a considerable period of time for the Polish troops to cross into Romania while declining to intern them as international law required. Instead, the Poles were allowed to travel to Constan\u021ba to board ships to take them to Marseille to continue the fight against Germany from France. The Romanian Bridgehead remained a key escape route for thousands of Poles in the desperate days of September 1939. It was only after receiving a number of furious complaints from Fabricius about the passage of Polish soldiers across Romania that Carol finally started to intern the fleeing Poles.\nOn 21 September 1939, Prime Minister C\u0103linescu was assassinated by the Iron Guard in a plot organized out of Berlin, thus silencing the strongest pro-Allied voice amongst Carol's \"camarilla\". The next day, the nine assassins of C\u0103linescu were publicity shot without the benefit of a trial and on the week of 22\u201328 September 1939, 242 members of the Iron Guard were the victims of extrajudicial executions. Because of its oil, Romania was highly important by both sides, and during the Phoney War of 1939\u201340 there occurred what Weinberg called a \"silent struggle over Romania's oil,\" with the German government doing everything within its power to have as much Romanian oil as possible while the British and French governments equally doing everything possible to deny it. The British launched an unsuccessful campaign to sabotage Romanian oil fields and the transportation network that took Romanian oil to Germany. In January 1940, Carol broadcast a speech to proclaim that it was his brilliant handling of foreign policy that kept Romania neutral and safe from danger. He also announced that he was going to be building a gigantic defense line around the kingdom, and as such, taxes would have to rise to pay for it. Romanians called the proposed line the Imaginet Line, as the line was considered to be a purely imaginary version of the Maginot line and many of Carol's subjects suspected that the money raised by higher taxes would go to the king's Swiss bank accounts.\nCarol had hedged his bets about whether to choose between the Allies and the Axis. It was only in late May 1940, when France was clearly losing the war that Carol swung decisively over to the Axis side. During the later period of the Phoney War, after waging a campaign of bloody repression against the Iron Guard, which reached its peak after C\u0103linescu's assassination, Carol began a policy of reaching out to the surviving Iron Guard leaders. Carol felt that a \"tamed\" Iron Guard could be used as a source of popular support. In April 1940, Carol had reached an agreement with Vasile Noveanu, the leader of the underground Iron Guard in Romania, but it was not until early May 1940 that Horia Sima, the leader of the Iron Guards in exile in Germany, could be persuaded to support the government. On 26 May 1940, Sima returned to Romania from Germany to begin talks with General Mihail Moruzov of the secret service about the Iron Guard joining the government. On 28 May 1940, after learning of the surrender of Belgium, Carol told the Crown Council that Germany was going to win the war, and Romania accordingly needed to realign its foreign and domestic policies with the victors. On 13 June 1940, an agreement was reached whereas the Iron Guard would be allowed to join the National Renaissance Front in exchange for more and harsher anti-Semitic laws. The National Renaissance Front was reorganized as the Party of the Nation, which was described as \"a single and totalitarian party under the supreme leadership of His Majesty, King Carol II.\" On 21 June 1940, France signed an armistice with Germany. Romania's elite had been so obsessively Francophile for so long that France's defeat had the effect of discrediting that elite in the eyes of public opinion and led to an upswing of popular support for the pro-German Iron Guard.\nIn the midst of the turn towards the Iron Guard and Germany came a bombshell from abroad. On 26 June 1940, the Soviet Union submitted an ultimatum demanding that Romania hand over the Bessarabia region (which had been Russian until 1918) and the northern part of Bukovina (which had never been Russian) to the Soviet Union and threatened war within the next two days if the ultimatum was rejected. Carol had at one moment considered following the example of Finland in 1939 when faced with a similar Soviet ultimatum, but the outcome of the Winter War was scarcely an inspiring example. Carol at first considered rejecting the ultimatum, but upon being informed that the Romanian Army would be no match for the Red Army, agreed to cede Bessarabia and northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union. Carol appealed to Berlin for support against the Soviet ultimatum, only to be told to comply with Stalin's demands. The loss of the regions without any fighting to the Soviet Union was felt to be a national humiliation by the Romanian people and was a huge blow to Carol's prestige. Carol's personality cult had by 1940 reached such extreme heights that the withdrawal without any resistance from Bessarabia and northern Bukovina revealed that Carol was a mere man after all, and so badly dented his prestige more than would have been the case if Carol had maintained a more modest image.\nOn 28 June 1940, Sima entered the cabinet as Under-Secretary of State at the Ministry of Education. On 1 July 1940, Carol, in a radio speech, renounced both the 1926 alliance with France and the 1939 Anglo-French \"guarantee\" of Romania, saying that henceforth Romania would seek its place in the German-dominated \"New Order\" in Europe. The next day, Carol invited a German military mission to train the Romanian Army. On 4 July 1940, Carol was sworn into a new government headed by Ion Gigurtu with Sima as Minister of Arts and Culture. Gigurtu had been a leading figure in the anti-Semitic National Christian Party in the 1930s, was a millionaire businessman with many connections to Germany, and was a well-known Germanophile. For all these reasons, Carol hoped that having Gigurtu as prime minister would win him Hitler's goodwill and thus prevent any further loss of territory. Along the same lines, Carol signed a new economic treaty with Germany on 8 August 1940, that finally gave the Germans the economic dominance of Romania and its oil that they had been seeking all through the 1930s.\nImmediately afterwards, inspired by the Soviet example of gaining Romanian territory, the Bulgarians demanded the return of Dobruja, lost in the Second Balkan War of 1913, while the Hungarians demanded the return of Transylvania, lost to Romania after World War I. Romania and Bulgaria opened talks that led to the Treaty of Craiova, which saw the southern Dobruja ceded to Bulgaria. In particular, Carol proved unwilling to cede Transylvania, and had it not been for the diplomatic intervention of Germany and Italy, Romania and Hungary would have gone to war with each other in the summer of 1940. In the meantime, Carol imprisoned General Ion Antonescu after the latter had criticized the king, charging that it was the corruption of the royal government that was responsible for the military backwardness of Romania and hence the loss of Bessarabia. Both Fabricius and Hermann Neubacher, the man in charge of the Four Year Plan's operations in the Balkans, intervened with Carol, saying that Antonescu's \"accidental death\" or being \"shot while trying to escape\" would \"make a very bad impression on the German headquarters,\" as Antonescu was known to be a leading advocate of an alliance with Germany. On 11 July 1940, Carol had Antonescu freed, but kept under house arrest at the Bistri\u021ba monastery.\nHitler was alarmed about the possibility of a Hungarian-Romanian war, which he feared might result in the destruction of Romania's oil fields and/or might lead to the Soviets intervening to seize all of Romania. At this time, Hitler was already seriously considering invading the Soviet Union in 1941, and if he were to take such a step, he would need Romanian oil to power his military. At the Second Vienna Award of 30 August 1940, the German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop and the Italian Foreign Minister Count Galeazzo Ciano ruled that northern Transylvania was to go to Hungary while southern Transylvania would stay with Romania, a compromise that left both Budapest and Bucharest deeply unhappy with the Vienna award. For economic reasons, Romania was far more important to Hitler than was Hungary, but Romania had been allied to France since 1926 and had flirted with joining the British-inspired \"peace front\" in 1939, so Hitler who personally disliked and mistrusted Carol \u2013 felt that Romania deserved to be punished for waiting so long to align with the Axis. After the fall of Paris in June 1940, the Germans had captured the archives of the Quai d'Orsay and were thus well-informed about the double-line that Carol had pursued until the spring of 1940. Hitler was annoyed with Carol's efforts to forge closer ties with France at the same time proclaiming his friendship towards Germany. At the same time, Hitler offered Carol a \"guarantee\" of the rest of Romania against further territorial losses, which Carol promptly accepted.\nRoad to abdication.\nThe acceptance of the Second Vienna Award completely discredited Carol with his people, and in early September 1940 enormous demonstrations broke out all over Romania demanding that Carol abdicate. On 1 September 1940, Sima (who had resigned from the government) gave a speech calling upon Carol to abdicate, and the Iron Guard began to organize demonstrations all over Romania to press for his abdication. On 2 September 1940, Valer Pop, a courtier and an important member of the \"camarilla\" first advised Carol to appoint General Ion Antonescu as prime minister as the solution to the crisis. Pop's reasons for advising Carol to have Antonescu as prime minister was partly because Antonescu \u2013 who was known to be friendly with the Iron Guard and had been imprisoned under Carol \u2013 was believed to have enough of an oppositional background to appease the public and partly because Pop knew that Antonescu for all his Legionary sympathies was a member of the elite and would never turn against it. As the increasingly large crowds started to assemble outside of the royal palace demanding the king's abdication, Carol considered Pop's advice, but was reluctant to have Antonescu as prime minister. As more and more people started to join the protests, Pop feared that Romania was on the verge of a revolution that might not only sweep away the king's regime, but also the elite who had dominated the country since the 19th century. To apply further pressure on Carol, Pop met with Fabricius on the night of 4 September 1940 to ask him to tell Carol that the \"Reich\" wanted Antonescu as prime minister, which led to Fabricius promptly calling Carol to tell him to appoint the general as the prime minister. Additionally, the very ambitious General Antonescu who long coveted the premiership now suddenly started to downplay his long-standing antipathy to Carol, and he suggested that he was prepared to forgive past slights and disputes.\nOn 5 September 1940, Antonescu became prime minister, and Carol transferred most of his dictatorial powers to him. As prime minister, Antonescu was a man acceptable to both the Iron Guard and the traditional elite. Carol planned to stay as king after appointing Antonescu and initially Antonescu did not support the popular demand for Carol's abdication. Antonescu had become prime minister, but he had a weak political base. As an Army officer, Antonescu was a loner, an arrogant and aloft man with an extremely bad temper who as a consequence was very unpopular with his fellow officers. Antonescu's relations with the politicians were no better, and as such Antonescu was initially unwilling to move against the king until he had some political allies. Carol ordered Antonescu and General Dumitru Coroam\u0103 who commanded the troops in Bucharest to shoot down demonstrators in front of the royal palace, an order that both refused to obey. It was only on 6 September 1940, when Antonescu learned of a plot to murder him headed by another member of the \"camarilla\" General Paul Teodorescu that Antonescu joined the chorus demanding Carol's abdication. With public opinion solidly against him and with the Army refusing to obey his orders, Carol was forced to abdicate.\nConcerning the claim of the American historian Larry Watts that it was Carol that allied Romania to Nazi Germany and that Marshal Ion Antonescu had unwillingly inherited an alliance with Germany in 1940, the Canadian historian Dov Lungu wrote:\n[Watts's] claim that Romania's \"de facto\" alliance with Germany under Antonescu was the work of Carol, who began laying its foundations for it as early as 1938, is wide off the mark. Carol's concessions to Germany were made half\u2013heartedly and delayed as much as possible in the hope that the western powers would regain the initiative on the political-diplomatic front and, from September 1939, the military one. He finally did change his country's external economic and political orientation, but only in the spring of 1940, when German hegemony on the Continent seemed imminent. In addition, there is more than a subtle distinction between Carol's request in the last weeks of his rule for the dispatch of a German military mission to train the ill\u2013prepared Romanian Army and Antonescu's decision almost immediately after assuming power to fight on Germany's side until the very end. In fact, in his desire to regain the province of Bessarabia, Antonescu was keener than the Germans' in Romania's participation in an anti-Soviet war.\nExile.\nForced under Soviet and subsequently Hungarian, Bulgarian, and German pressure to surrender parts of his kingdom to foreign rule, he was finally outmaneuvered by the pro-German administration of Marshal Ion Antonescu, and abdicated in favour of Michael in September 1940. He went into exile, first in Mexico, then in Portugal. While in Portugal, he stayed in Estoril, at Casa do Mar e Sol. Carol and Lupescu finally settled in Mexico City, where he purchased a house in one of Mexico City's most expensive districts. During World War II, Carol tried to set up a Free Romania movement based in Mexico to overthrow General Antonescu. Carol had hopes that his Free Romania movement would be recognized as a government-in-exile and would ultimately lead to him being restored. The closest Carol ever got to having his Free Romania movement recognized came in 1942 when President Manuel \u00c1vila Camacho allowed Carol to stand beside him while reviewing his troops. Carol would have liked to operate out of the United States, but the American government refused him permission to enter. However, Carol was in contact with two Eastern Orthodox priests living in Chicago, Father Glicherie Moraru and Father Alexandru Opreanu, who organized an unsuccessful campaign in the Romanian-American community to pressure the American government to recognize the \"Free Romania\" committee as the legitimate government of Romania.\nTo advance his cause, Carol published a magazine in America called \"The Free Romanian\" and published several books in both Romanian and English. A major problem for Carol's efforts to mobilize the Romanian American community was the Immigration Control Act of 1924, which drastically limited immigration from Eastern Europe into the United States. As such, the majority of Romanian Americans in the 1940s were either persons who immigrated prior to 1924 or their children; in either case, Carol did not mean much to them. Furthermore, many Romanian Americans were Jews who had neither forgiven nor forgotten that it was Carol who had appointed the anti-Semitic fanatic Goga as prime minister in 1937. To improve his image amongst Jews, Carol persuaded Leon Fischer, the former vice-president of the United Romanian Jews of America, to write articles on his behalf in American Jewish magazines that portrayed the former king as the friend and protector of the Jews and an enemy of anti-Semitism. The reaction to Fischer's articles was overwhelmingly negative with a flood of letters to the editor who complained bitterly that it was Carol who signed in all of Goga's laws that took away Romanian citizenship from Jews and made it illegal for Romanian Jews to own land and shares in public companies and work as lawyers, doctors, teachers, etc. Furthermore, the writers of the letters noted that Carol allowed these laws to remain on the statute books after dismissing Goga and sarcastically commented that if Carol was the best friend of the Jews in Romania, then Romanian Jews certainly did not need enemies.\nCarol's offers to have his Free Romania committee recognized as a government-in-exile was hindered by his unpopularity in his own homeland with many British and American diplomats arguing that supporting the former king was likely to increase public support for General Antonescu. Beyond that, there was a rival Free Romania committee headed by Viorel Tilea based in London that wanted to have nothing to do with Carol's committee in Mexico City. Virgil Tilea had as a university student in the 1930s supported the Iron Guard. Unusually for a Romanian in this period, Tilea was an Anglophile rather a Francophile, and had attended Cambridge University as an exchange student. Tilea's time in Britain changed his political views as he later stated that seeing many different types of people living in harmony in Britain made him realize that it was not necessary for one ethnic group to dominate all the others as Codreanu had proclaimed, leading him to break with Iron Guard. When General Antonescu was sworn in as prime minister as the new \"National Legionary State\", Tilea resigned as Romanian minister in London in protest at the appointment. Later in 1940, Tilea formed his Free Romania committee in London that attracted support from a number of Romanians who fled the Antonescu regime into exile.\nTilea's Free Committee was not officially recognized by the British government, but was known to have the support of Britain and to be very close to the Polish government-in-exile, which was a major reason why the British spurned the Carol's rival Free Romania committee based in Mexico City, which tended to attract support only from those Romanians who been closely associated with the king's \"camarilla\". Tilea's committee had an office in Istanbul which regularly sent couriers to a safe house in Bucharest, where messages were exchanged with one of Carol's former prime ministers Constantin Argetoianu who in turn acted as an emissary for those opposed to Antonescu. Argetoianu reported that King Michael was opposed to the Antonescu regime and wanted to stage a coup d'\u00e9tat to depose Antonescu, waiting only for the Allies to invade the Balkans. General Antonescu was the dictator, but Romanian army officers took their oath of loyalty to the king, so there was reason to believe in London that the Romanian Army would side with the king against the prime minister if the two came into conflict. From the British viewpoint, associating themselves with Carol's campaign to once again depose his own son would only complicate their dealings with King Michael.\nCarol and Magda Lupescu were married in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on 3 June 1947, Magda calling herself Princess Elena von Hohenzollern. In 1947 after the Communist take-over of Romania, a Romanian National Committee was set up to oppose the Communist regime. Carol's efforts to join the Romanian National Committee were rebuffed as all the factions were opposed to him, and Romanian monarchists on the committee made it clear that they regarded King Michael, not his father as the legitimate king of Romania. Carol remained in exile for the rest of his life. He was never to see his son, King Michael, after his 1940 departure from Romania. Michael could see no point in meeting his father who had humiliated his mother so many times via his open affairs and did not attend his funeral.\nRemains returned to Romania.\nCarol died in Estoril, on the Portuguese Riviera in 1953. His coffin was placed inside the Pantheon of the House of Braganza in Lisbon. His remains were finally returned to the Curtea de Arge\u0219 monastery in Romania in 2003, the traditional burial ground of Romanian royalty, at the request and expense of the government of Romania (led by Adrian N\u0103stase). They initially lay outside the cathedral, the burial place of Romanian kings and queens, as Elena was not of royal blood. Neither of his sons participated in either ceremony. King Michael I was represented by his daughter, Crown Princess Margareta, her husband, Prince Radu and two grandchildren Nicolae de Roumanie-Medforth-Mills and Karina de Roumanie Medforth-Mills.\nIn January 2018, it was announced that the remains of King Carol II would be moved to the new Archdiocesan and Royal Cathedral, along with those of Princess Helen. In addition, the remains of Prince Mircea would also be moved to the new cathedral. His remains were at the time interred at the Bran Castle's Chapel. King Carol II of Romania was reburied at the New Episcopal and Royal Cathedral in Curtea de Arge\u0219 on 8 March 2019.\nCarol Lambrino was forbidden (since 1940) from entering Romanian territory, but a Romanian court declared him a legitimate son in 2003. Carol visited Bucharest in November 2005, shortly before his death.\nArchives.\nYoung Prince Carol's letters to his grandfather, Leopold of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, are preserved in the Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen family archive, which is in the State Archive of Sigmaringen (Staatsarchiv Sigmaringen) in the town of Sigmaringen, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany. There are also letters from young Carol (together with letters from his mother, Crown Princess Marie) to his great-grandmother, Josephine of Baden, preserved in the State Archive of Sigmaringen (Staatsarchiv Sigmaringen).\nCarol II of Romania's letters to Zizi Lambrino as well as documents about their marriage are preserved in the \"Jeanne Marie Valentine Lambrino Papers\" collection in the Hoover Institution Archives (Stanford, California, US).\nIn popular culture.\nCarol appears as a character [as Prince Carol] in the final episode of the third season of \"Mr. Selfridge\", where he is played in a cameo appearance by British actor Anton Blake.\nCarol is also considered to be the inspiration for the character Prince Charles of Carpathia in the 1953 play \"The Sleeping Prince\" and the 1957 related film \"The Prince and the Showgirl\". \"Ex-King Carol Weds Lupescu\" was front-page news next to an article announcing a downed flying saucer in Roswell, New Mexico.\nHe makes an appearance in the 2019 film \"Marie, Queen of Romania\" as an antagonist along with his mistress.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Having been responsible for facilitating the Holocaust in Romania, he was overthrown in 1944, before being tried for war crimes and executed two years later in 1946.\nA Romanian Army career officer who made his name during the 1907 peasants' revolt and the World War I Romanian campaign, the antisemitic Antonescu sympathized with far-right and fascist politics. He was a military attach\u00e9 to France and later Chief of the General Staff, briefly serving as Defence Minister in the National Christian cabinet of Octavian Goga as well as the subsequent First Cristea cabinet, in which he also served as Air and Marine Minister. During the late 1930s, his political stance brought him into conflict with King Carol II and led to his detainment. Antonescu rose to political prominence during the political crisis of 1940, and established the National Legionary State, an uneasy partnership with Horia Sima of the Iron Guard. After entering Romania into an alliance with Nazi Germany, he eliminated the Guard during the Legionary Rebellion of 1941. In addition to being Prime Minister, he served as his own Foreign Minister and Defence Minister. Soon after Romania joined the Axis in Operation Barbarossa, recovering Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, Antonescu also became Marshal of Romania.\nAn atypical figure among Holocaust perpetrators, Antonescu enforced policies independently responsible for the deaths of as many as 400,000 people, most of them Bessarabian, Ukrainian and Romanian Jews, as well as Romanian Romani. The regime's complicity in the Holocaust combined pogroms and mass murders such as the Odessa massacre with ethnic cleansing, and systematic deportations to occupied Transnistria. The system in place was nevertheless characterized by singular inconsistencies, prioritizing plunder over killing, showing leniency toward most Jews in the Old Kingdom, and ultimately refusing to adopt the Final Solution. This was made possible by the fact that Romania, as a junior ally of Nazi Germany, was not occupied by the Wehrmacht and preserved a degree of political autonomy.\nAerial attacks on Romania by the Allies in 1944 and heavy casualties on the Eastern Front prompted Antonescu to open peace negotiations with the Allies, which were inconclusive. On 23 August 1944, King Michael I led a coup d'\u00e9tat against Antonescu, who was arrested; after the war he was convicted of war crimes, and executed in June 1946. His involvement in the Holocaust was officially reasserted and condemned following the 2003 Wiesel Commission report.\nBiography.\nEarly life and career.\nBorn in the town of Pite\u0219ti, north-west of the capital Bucharest, Antonescu was the scion of an upper-middle class Romanian Orthodox family with some military tradition. He was especially close to his mother, Li\u021ba Baranga, who survived his death. His father, an army officer, wanted Ion to follow in his footsteps and thus sent him to attend the Infantry and Cavalry School in Craiova. During his childhood, his father divorced his mother to marry a woman who was a Jewish convert to Orthodoxy. The breakup of his parents' marriage was a traumatic event for the young Antonescu, and he made no secret of his dislike of his stepmother, whom he always depicted as a \"femme fatale\" who destroyed what he saw as his parents' happy marriage.\nAccording to one account, Antonescu was briefly a classmate of Wilhelm Filderman, the future Romanian Jewish community activist whose interventions with \"Conduc\u0103tor\" Antonescu helped save a number of his coreligionists. After graduation, in 1904, Antonescu joined the Romanian Army with the rank of Second Lieutenant. He spent the following two years attending courses at the Special Cavalry Section in T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te. Reportedly, Antonescu was a zealous and goal-setting student, upset by the slow pace of promotions, and compensated for his diminutive stature through toughness. In time, the reputation of being a tough and ruthless commander, together with his reddish hair, earned him the nickname \"C\u00e2inele Ro\u0219u\" (\"The Red Dog\"). Antonescu also developed a reputation for questioning his commanders and for appealing over their heads whenever he felt they were wrong.\nDuring the repression of the 1907 peasants' revolt, he headed a cavalry unit in Covurlui County. Opinions on his role in the events diverge: while some historians believe Antonescu was a particularly violent participant in quelling the revolt, others equate his participation with that of regular officers or view it as outstandingly tactful. In addition to restricting peasant protests, Antonescu's unit subdued socialist activities in Gala\u021bi port. His handling of the situation earned him praise from King Carol I, who sent Crown Prince (future monarch) Ferdinand to congratulate him in front of the whole garrison. The following year, Antonescu was promoted to Lieutenant, and, between 1911 and 1913, he attended the Advanced War School, receiving the rank of Captain upon graduation. In 1913, during the Second Balkan War against Bulgaria, Antonescu served as a staff officer in the First Cavalry Division in Dobruja.\nWorld War I.\nAfter 1916, when Romania entered World War I on the Allied side, Ion Antonescu acted as chief of staff for General Constantin Prezan. When enemy troops crossed the mountains from Transylvania into Wallachia, Antonescu was ordered to design a defence plan for Bucharest.\nThe Romanian royal court, army, and administration were subsequently forced to retreat into Moldavia. Antonescu took part in an important decision involving defensive efforts, an unusual promotion which probably stoked his ambitions. In December, as Prezan became the Chief of the General Staff, Antonescu, who was by now a major, was named the head of operations, being involved in the defence of Moldavia. He contributed to the tactics used during the Battle of M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti (July\u2013August 1917), when Romanians under General Eremia Grigorescu managed to stop the advance of German forces under the command of Field Marshal August von Mackensen. Being described as \"a talented if prickly individual\", Antonescu lived in Prezan's proximity for the remainder of the war and influenced his decisions. Such was the influence of Antonescu on General Prezan that General Alexandru Averescu used the formula \"Prezan (Antonescu)\" in his memoirs to denote Prezan's plans and actions.\nThat autumn, Romania's main ally, the Russian Provisional Government, left the conflict. Its successor, Bolshevik Russia, made peace with the Central Powers, leaving Romania the only enemy of the Central Powers on the Eastern Front. In these conditions, the Romanian government made its own peace treaty with the Central Powers. Romania broke the treaty later in the year, on the grounds that King Ferdinand I had not signed it. During the interval, Antonescu, who viewed the separate peace as \"the most rational solution,\" was assigned command over a cavalry regiment. The renewed offensive played a part in ensuring the union of Transylvania with Romania. After the war, Antonescu's merits as an operations officer were noticed by, among others, politician Ion G. Duca, who wrote that \"his [Antonescu's] intelligence, skill and activity, brought credit on himself and invaluable service to the country.\" Another event occurring late in the war is also credited with having played a major part in Antonescu's life: in 1918, Crown Prince Carol (the future King Carol II) left his army posting to marry a commoner. This outraged Antonescu, who developed enduring contempt for the future king.\nDiplomatic assignments and General Staff positions.\nLieutenant Colonel Ion Antonescu retained his visibility in the public eye during the interwar period. He participated in the political campaign to earn recognition at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 for Romania's gains in Transylvania. His nationalist argument about a future state was published as the essay \"Rom\u00e2nii. Origina, trecutul, sacrificiile \u0219i drepturile lor\" (\"The Romanians. Their Origin, Their Past, Their Sacrifices and Their Rights\"). The booklet advocated extension of Romanian rule beyond the confines of Greater Romania, and recommended, at the risk of war with the emerging Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the annexation of all Banat areas and the Timok Valley. Antonescu was known for his frequent and erratic changes of mood, going from being extremely angry to being calm to angry again to being calm again within minutes, behaviour that often disoriented those who had to work with him. The Israeli historian Jean Ancel wrote that Antonescu's frequent changes of mood were due to the syphilis he contracted as a young man, a condition he suffered from for the rest of his life.\nHe became military attach\u00e9 in Paris in 1922. He negotiated 100 million French francs worth of credit in order to purchase French weaponry. He worked together with Romanian diplomat Nicolae Titulescu; the two became personal friends. He was also in contact with the Romanian-born conservative aristocrat and writer Marthe Bibesco, who introduced Antonescu to the ideas of Gustave Le Bon, a researcher of crowd psychology who had an influence on Fascism. Bibesco saw Antonescu as a new version of 19th century nationalist Frenchman Georges Boulanger, introducing him as such to Le Bon. In 1923, he made the acquaintance of lawyer Mihai Antonescu, who was to become his close friend, legal representative and political associate.\nAfter returning to Romania in 1926, Antonescu resumed his teaching in Sibiu, and, in the autumn of 1928, became Secretary-General of the Defence Ministry in the Vintil\u0103 Br\u0103tianu cabinet. He married Maria Niculescu, for long a resident of France, who had been married twice before: first to a Romanian Police officer, with whom she had a son, Gheorghe (died 1944), and then to a Frenchman of Jewish origin. After a period as Deputy Chief of the General Staff, he was appointed its Chief (1933\u20131934). These assignments coincided with the rule of Carol's underage son Michael I and his regents, and with Carol's seizure of power in 1930. During this period Antonescu first grew interested in the Iron Guard, an antisemitic and fascist-related movement headed by Corneliu Zelea Codreanu. In his capacity as Deputy Chief of Staff, he ordered the Army's intelligence unit to compile a report on the faction, and made a series of critical notes on Codreanu's various statements.\nAs Chief of Staff, Antonescu reportedly had his first confrontation with the political class and the monarch. His projects for weapon modernization were questioned by defence minister Paul Angelescu, leading Antonescu to present his resignation. According to another account, he completed an official report on the embezzlement of Army funds which indirectly implicated Carol and his \"camarilla\" &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;. The king consequently ordered him out of office, provoking indignation among sections of the political mainstream. On Carol's orders, Antonescu was placed under surveillance by the \"Siguran\u021ba Statului\" intelligence service, and closely monitored by the Interior Ministry Undersecretary Armand C\u0103linescu. The officer's political credentials were on the rise, as he was able to establish and maintain contacts with people on all sides of the political spectrum, while support for Carol plummeted. Among these were contacts with the two main democratic groups, the National Liberal and the National Peasants', parties known respectively as PNL and PN\u021a. He was also engaged in discussions with the rising far right, antisemitic and fascist movements; although in competition with each other, both the National Christian Party (PNC) of Octavian Goga and the Iron Guard sought to attract Antonescu to their side. In 1936, to the authorities' alarm, Army General and Iron Guard member Gheorghe Cantacuzino-Gr\u0103nicerul arranged a meeting between Antonescu and the movement's leader, Corneliu Codreanu. Antonescu is reported to have found Codreanu arrogant, but to have welcomed his revolutionizing approach to politics.\nDefence portfolio and the Codreanu trials.\nIn late 1937, after the December general election came to an inconclusive result, Carol appointed Goga Prime Minister over a far right cabinet that was the first executive to impose racial discrimination in its treatment of the Jewish community. Goga's appointment was meant to curb the rise of the more popular and even more radical Codreanu. Initially given the Communications portfolio by his rival, Interior Minister Armand C\u0103linescu, Antonescu repeatedly demanded the office of Defence Minister, which he was eventually granted. His mandate coincided with a troubled period, and saw Romania having to choose between its traditional alliance with France, Britain, the crumbling Little Entente and the League of Nations or moving closer to Nazi Germany and its Anti-Comintern Pact. Antonescu's own contribution is disputed by historians, who variously see him as either a supporter of the Anglo-French alliance or, like the PNC itself, more favourable to cooperation with Adolf Hitler's Germany. At the time, Antonescu viewed Romania's alliance with the Entente as insurance against Hungarian and Soviet revanchism, but, as an anti-communist, he was suspicious of the Franco-Soviet rapprochement. Particularly concerned about Hungarian demands in Transylvania, he ordered the General Staff to prepare for a western attack. However, his major contribution in office was in relation to an internal crisis: as a response to violent clashes between the Iron Guard and the PNC's own fascist militia, the \"L\u0103ncieri\", Antonescu extended the already imposed martial law.\nThe Goga cabinet ended when the tentative rapprochement between Goga and Codreanu prompted Carol to overthrow the democratic system and proclaim his own authoritarian regime &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;. The deposed Premier died in 1938, while Antonescu remained a close friend of his widow, Veturia Goga. By that time, revising his earlier stance, Antonescu had also built a close relationship with Codreanu, and was even said to have become his confidant. On Carol's request, he had earlier asked the Guard's leader to consider an alliance with the king, which Codreanu promptly refused in favour of negotiations with Goga, coupled with claims that he was not interested in political battles, an attitude supposedly induced by Antonescu himself.\nSoon afterward, C\u0103linescu, acting on indications from the monarch, arrested Codreanu and prosecuted him in two successive trials. Antonescu, whose mandate of Defence Minister had been prolonged under the premiership of Miron Cristea, resigned in protest of Codreanu's arrest. Antonescu's mandate ended on 30 March 1938. He also served as Air and Marine Minister between 2 February and his resignation on 30 March. He was a celebrity defence witness at the latter's first and second trials. During the latter, which resulted in Codreanu's conviction for treason, Antonescu vouched for his friend's honesty while shaking his hand in front of the jury. Upon the conclusion of the trial, the king ordered his former minister interned at Predeal, before assigning him to command the Third Army in the remote eastern region of Bessarabia (and later removing him after Antonescu expressed sympathy for Guardists imprisoned in Chi\u0219in\u0103u). Attempting to discredit his rival, Carol also ordered Antonescu's wife to be tried for bigamy, based on a false claim that her divorce had not been finalized. Defended by Mihai Antonescu, the officer was able to prove his detractors wrong. Codreanu himself was taken into custody and discreetly killed by the Gendarmes acting on Carol's orders (November 1938).\nCarol's regime slowly dissolved into crisis, a dissolution accelerated after the start of World War II, when the military success of the core Axis powers and the non-aggression pact signed by Germany and the Soviet Union saw Romania isolated and threatened &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;. In 1940, two of Romania's regions, Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, were lost to a Soviet occupation consented to by the king. This came as Romania, exposed by the Fall of France, was seeking to align its policies with those of Germany. Antonescu himself had come to value a pro-Axis alternative after the 1938 Munich Agreement, when Germany imposed demands on Czechoslovakia with the acquiescence of France and the United Kingdom, leaving locals to fear that, unless reoriented, Romania would follow. Angered by the territorial losses of 1940, General Antonescu sent Carol a general note of protest, and, as a result, was arrested and interned at Bistri\u021ba Monastery. While there, he commissioned Mihai Antonescu to establish contacts with Nazi German officials, promising to advance German economic interest, particularly in respect to the local oil industry, in exchange for endorsement. Commenting on Antonescu's ambivalent stance, Hitler's minister to Romania, Wilhelm Fabricius, wrote to his superiors: \"I am not convinced that he is a safe man.\"\nRise to power.\nRomania's elite had been intensely Francophile ever since Romania had won its independence in the 19th century, indeed so Francophile that the defeat of France in June 1940 had the effect of discrediting the entire elite. Antonescu's internment ended in August, during which interval, under Axis pressure, Romania had ceded Southern Dobruja to Bulgaria (\"see Treaty of Craiova\") and Northern Transylvania to Hungary &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;. The latter grant caused consternation among large sections of Romania's population, causing Carol's popularity to fall to a record low and provoking large-scale protests in Bucharest, the capital. These movements were organized competitively by the pro-Allied PN\u021a, headed by Iuliu Maniu, and the pro-Nazi Iron Guard. The latter group had been revived under the leadership of Horia Sima, and was organizing a \"coup d'\u00e9tat\". In this troubled context, Antonescu simply left his assigned residence. He may have been secretly helped in this by German intercession, but was more directly aided to escape by socialite Alice Sturdza, who was acting on Maniu's request. Antonescu subsequently met with Maniu in Ploie\u0219ti, where they discussed how best to manage the political situation. While these negotiations were carried out, the monarch himself was being advised by his entourage to recover legitimacy by governing in tandem with the increasingly popular Antonescu, while creating a new political majority from the existing forces. \nOn 2 September 1940, Valer Pop, a courtier and an important member of the \"camarilla\", first advised Carol to appoint Antonescu as Prime Minister as the solution to the crisis. Pop's reasons for advising Carol to appoint Antonescu as Prime Minister were partly because Antonescu, who was known to be friendly with the Iron Guard and who had been imprisoned under Carol, was believed to have enough of an oppositional background to Carol's regime to appease the public and partly because Pop knew that Antonescu, for all his Legionary sympathies, was a member of the elite and believed he would never turn against it. When Carol proved reluctant to make Antonescu Prime Minister, Pop visited the German legation to meet with Fabricius on the night of 4 September 1940 to ask that the German minister phone Carol to tell him that the \"Reich\" wanted Antonescu as Prime Minister, and Fabricius promptly did just that. Carol and Antonescu accepted the proposal, Antonescu being ordered to approach political party leaders Maniu of the PN\u021a and Dinu Br\u0103tianu of the PNL. They all called for Carol's abdication as a preliminary measure, while Sima, another leader sought after for negotiations, could not be found in time to express his opinion. Antonescu partly complied with the request but also asked Carol to bestow upon him the reserve powers for Romanian heads of state. Carol yielded and, on 5 September 1940, the general became Prime Minister, and Carol transferred most of his dictatorial powers to him. The latter's first measure was to curtail potential resistance within the Army by relieving Bucharest Garrison chief Gheorghe Arge\u0219anu of his position and replacing him with Dumitru Coroam\u0103. Shortly afterward, Antonescu heard rumours that two of Carol's loyalist generals, Gheorghe Mihail and Paul Teodorescu, were planning to have him killed. In reaction, he forced Carol to abdicate, while General Coroam\u0103 was refusing to carry out the royal order of shooting down Iron Guardist protesters.\nMichael ascended the throne for the second time, while Antonescu's dictatorial powers were confirmed and extended. On 6 September, the day Michael formally assumed the throne, he issued a royal decree declaring Antonescu \"Conduc\u0103tor\" (leader) of the state. The same decree relegated the monarch to a ceremonial role. Among Antonescu's subsequent measures was ensuring the safe departure into self-exile of Carol and his mistress Elena Lupescu, granting protection to the royal train when it was attacked by armed members of the Iron Guard. The regime of King Carol had been notorious for being the most corrupt regime in Europe during the 1930s, and when Carol fled Romania, he took with him the better part of the Romanian treasury, leaving the new government with enormous financial problems. Antonescu had expected, perhaps na\u00efvely, that Carol would take with him enough money to provide for a comfortable exile, and was surprised that Carol had cleared out almost the entire national treasury. For the next four years, a major concern of Antonescu's government was attempting to have the Swiss banks where Carol had deposited the assets return the money to Romania; this effort did not meet with success. \nHoria Sima's subsequent cooperation with Antonescu was endorsed by high-ranking Nazi German officials, many of whom feared the Iron Guard was too weak to rule on its own. Antonescu therefore received the approval of Ambassador Fabricius. Despite early promises, Antonescu abandoned projects for the creation of a national government, and opted instead for a coalition between a military dictatorship lobby and the Iron Guard. He later justified his choice by stating that the Iron Guard \"represented the political base of the country at the time.\" Right from the outset, Antonescu clashed with Sima over economic questions, with Antonescu's main concern being to get the economy growing so as to provide taxes for a treasury looted by Carol, while Sima favoured populist economic measures that Antonescu insisted there was no money for.\nAntonescu-Sima partnership.\nThe resulting regime, deemed the \"National Legionary State\", was officially proclaimed on 14 September. On that date, the Iron Guard was remodelled into the only legally permitted party in Romania. Antonescu continued as Premier and \"Conduc\u0103tor\", and was named as the Guard's honorary commander. Sima became Deputy Premier and leader of the Guard. Antonescu subsequently ordered the Guardists imprisoned by Carol to be set free. On 6 October, he presided over the Iron Guard's mass rally in Bucharest, one in a series of major celebratory and commemorative events organized by the movement during the late months of 1940. However, he tolerated the PN\u021a and PNL's informal existence, allowing them to preserve much of their political support.\nThere followed a short-lived and always uneasy partnership between Antonescu and Sima. In late September, the new regime denounced all pacts, accords and diplomatic agreements signed under Carol, bringing the country into Germany's orbit while subverting its relationship with a former Balkan ally, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Germans troops entered the country in stages, in order to defend the local oil industry and help instruct their Romanian counterparts on \"Blitzkrieg\" tactics. On 23 November, Antonescu was in Berlin, where his signature sealed Romania's commitment to the main Axis instrument, the Tripartite Pact. Two days later, the country also adhered to the Nazi-led Anti-Comintern Pact. Other than these generic commitments, Romania had no treaty binding it to Germany, and the Romanian-German alliance functioned informally. Speaking in 1946, Antonescu claimed to have followed the pro-German path in continuation of earlier policies, and for fear of a Nazi protectorate in Romania.\nDuring the National Legionary State period, earlier antisemitic legislation was upheld and strengthened, while the \"Romanianization\" of Jewish-owned enterprises became standard official practice. Immediately after coming into office, Antonescu himself expanded the anti-Jewish and Nuremberg law-inspired legislation passed by his predecessors Goga and Ion Gigurtu, while tens of new anti-Jewish regulations were passed in 1941\u20131942. This was done despite his formal pledge to Wilhelm Filderman and the Jewish Communities Federation that, unless engaged in \"sabotage,\" \"the Jewish population will not suffer.\" Antonescu did not reject the application of Legionary policies, but was offended by Sima's advocacy of paramilitarism and the Guard's frequent recourse to street violence. He drew much hostility from his partners by extending some protection to former dignitaries whom the Iron Guard had arrested. One early incident opposed Antonescu to the Guard's newspaper \"Buna Vestire\", which accused him of leniency and was subsequently forced to change its editorial board. By then, the Legionary press was routinely claiming that he was obstructing revolution and aiming to take control of the Iron Guard, and that he had been transformed into a tool of Freemasonry &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;. The political conflict coincided with major social challenges, including the influx of refugees from areas lost earlier in the year and a large-scale earthquake affecting Bucharest.\nDisorder peaked in the last days of November 1940, when, after uncovering the circumstances of Codreanu's death, the fascist movement ordered retaliations against political figures previously associated with Carol, carrying out the Jilava Massacre, the assassinations of Nicolae Iorga and Virgil Madgearu, and several other acts of violence. As retaliation for this insubordination, Antonescu ordered the Army to resume control of the streets, unsuccessfully pressured Sima to have the assassins detained, ousted the Iron Guardist prefect of Bucharest Police \u0218tefan Z\u0103voianu, and ordered Legionary ministers to swear an oath to the \"Conduc\u0103tor\". His condemnation of the killings was nevertheless limited and discreet, and, the same month, he joined Sima at a burial ceremony for Codreanu's newly discovered remains. The widening gap between the dictator and Sima's party resonated in Berlin. When, in December, Legionary Foreign Minister Mihail R. Sturdza obtained the replacement of Fabricius with Manfred Freiherr von Killinger, perceived as more sympathetic to the Iron Guard, Antonescu promptly took over leadership of the ministry, with the compliant diplomat Constantin Greceanu as his right hand. In Germany, such leaders of the Nazi Party as Heinrich Himmler, Baldur von Schirach and Joseph Goebbels threw their support behind the Legionaries, whereas Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop and the Wehrmacht stood by Antonescu. The latter group was concerned that any internal conflict would threaten Romania's oil industry, vital to the German war effort. The German leadership was by then secretly organizing \"Operation Barbarossa\", the attack on the Soviet Union.\nLegionary Rebellion and Operation Barbarossa.\nAntonescu's plan to act against his coalition partners in the event of further disorder hinged on Hitler's approval, a vague signal of which had been given during ceremonies confirming Romania's adherence to the Tripartite Pact. A decisive turn occurred when Hitler invited Antonescu and Sima both over for discussions: whereas Antonescu agreed, Sima stayed behind in Romania, probably plotting a \"coup d'\u00e9tat\". While Hitler did not produce a clear endorsement for clamping down on Sima's party, he made remarks interpreted by their recipient as oblique blessings. On 14 January 1941 during a German-Romanian summit, Hitler informed Antonescu of his plans to invade the Soviet Union later that year and asked Romania to participate. By this time, Hitler had come to the conclusion that while Sima was ideologically closer to him, Antonescu was the more competent leader capable of ensuring stability in Romania while being committed to aligning his country with the Axis.\nThe Antonescu-Sima dispute erupted into violence in January 1941, when the Iron Guard instigated a series of attacks on public institutions and a pogrom, incidents collectively known as the \"Legionary Rebellion.\" This came after the mysterious assassination of Major D\u00f6ring, a German agent in Bucharest, which was used by the Iron Guard as a pretext to accuse the \"Conduc\u0103tor\" of having a secret anti-German agenda, and made Antonescu oust the Legionary Interior Minister, Constantin Petrovicescu, while closing down all of the Legionary-controlled \"Romanianization\" offices. Various other clashes prompted him to demand the resignation of all Police commanders who sympathized with the movement. After two days of widespread violence, during which Guardists killed some 120 Bucharest Jews, Antonescu sent in the Army, under the command of General Constantin S\u0103n\u0103tescu. German officials acting on Hitler's orders, including the new Ambassador Manfred Freiherr von Killinger, helped Antonescu eliminate the Iron Guardists, but several of their lower-level colleagues actively aided Sima's subordinates. Goebbels was especially upset by the decision to support Antonescu, believing it to have been advantageous to \"the Freemasons.\"\nAfter the purge of the Iron Guard, Hitler kept his options open by granting political asylum to Sima\u2014whom Antonescu's courts sentenced to death\u2014and to other Legionaries in similar situations. The Guardists were detained in special conditions at Buchenwald and Dachau concentration camps. In parallel, Antonescu publicly obtained the cooperation of \"Codreanists\", members of an Iron Guardist wing which had virulently opposed Sima, and whose leader was Codreanu's father Ion Zelea Codreanu. Antonescu again sought backing from the PN\u021a and PNL to form a national cabinet, but his rejection of parliamentarism made the two groups refuse him.\nAntonescu traveled to Germany and met Hitler on eight more occasions between June 1941 and August 1944. Such close contacts helped cement an enduring relationship between the two dictators, and Hitler reportedly came to see Antonescu as the only trustworthy person in Romania, and the only foreigner to consult on military matters. The American historian Gerhard Weinberg wrote that Hitler after first meeting Antonescu \"...was greatly impressed by him; no other leader Hitler met other than Mussolini ever received such consistently favourable comments from the German dictator. Hitler even mustered the patience to listen to Antonescu's lengthy disquisitions on the glorious history of Romania and the perfidy of the Hungarians\u2014a curious reversal for a man who was more accustomed to regaling visitors with tirades of his own.\" In later statements, Hitler offered praise to Antonescu's \"breadth of vision\" and \"real personality.\" A remarkable aspect of the Hitler-Antonescu friendship was neither could speak other's language. Hitler only knew German, while the only foreign language Antonescu knew was French, in which he was completely fluent. During their meetings, Antonescu spoke French, which was then translated into German by Hitler's interpreter Paul Schmidt and vice versa, since Schmidt did not speak Romanian either. \nThe German military presence increased significantly in early 1941, when, using Romania as a base, Hitler invaded the rebellious Kingdom of Yugoslavia and the Kingdom of Greece &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;. In parallel, Romania's relationship with the United Kingdom, at the time the only major adversary of Nazi Germany, erupted into conflict: on 10 February 1941, British Premier Winston Churchill recalled His Majesty's Ambassador Reginald Hoare, and approved the blockade of Romanian ships in British-controlled ports. On 12 June 1941, during another summit with Hitler, Antonescu first learned of the \"special\" nature of Operation Barbarossa, namely, that the war against the Soviet Union was to be an ideological war to \"annihilate\" the forces of \"Judeo-Bolshevism,\" a \"war of extermination\" to be fought without any mercy; Hitler even showed Antonescu a copy of the \"Guidelines for the Conduct of the Troops in Russia\" he had issued to his forces about the \"special treatment\" to be handed out to Soviet Jews. Antonescu completely accepted Hitler's ideas about Operation Barbarossa as a \"race war\" between the Aryans, represented by the Nordic Germans and Latin Romanians on the Axis side vs. the Slavs and Asians, commanded by the Jews on the Soviet side. Besides anti-Semitism, there was an extremely strong current of anti-Slavic and anti-Asian racism to Antonescu's remarks about the \"Asiatic hordes\" of the Red Army. The Asians Antonescu referred were the various Asian peoples of the Soviet Union, such as the Kazakhs, Kalmyks, Mongols, Uzbeks, Buryats, etc. During his summit with Hitler in June 1941, Antonescu told the \"F\u00fchrer\" that he believed it was necessary to \"once and for all\" eliminate Russia as a power because the Russians were the most powerful Slavic nation and that as a Latin people, the Romanians had an inborn hatred of all Slavs and Jews. Antonescu went on to tell Hitler: \"Because of its racial qualities, Romania can continue to play its role as an anti-Slavic buffer for the benefit of Germany.\" Ancel wrote that Romanian anti-Slavic racism differed from the German variety in that the Romanians had traditionally feared the Slavic peoples whereas the Germans had traditionally held the Slavic peoples in contempt. In Antonescu's mind, the Romanians as a Latin people had attained a level of civilization that the Slavs were nowhere close to, but theoretically the Slavic Russians and Ukrainians might be able to reach under Romanian auspices, although Antonescu's remarks to Hitler that \"We must fight this race (i.e. the Slavs) resolutely\" together, \"with the need for 'colonization' of Transnistria,\" suggests that he did think this would happen in his own lifetime. Subsequently, the Romanians assigned to Barbarossa were to learn that as a Latin people, the Germans considered them to be their inferiors, albeit not as inferior as the Slavs, Asians and Jews who were viewed as \"untermenschen\" (\"sub-humans\"). Hitler's promise to Antonescu that after the war, the Germanic and Latin races would rule the world in a partnership turned out to be meaningless.\nIn June of that year, Romania joined the attack on the Soviet Union, led by Germany in coalition with Hungary, Finland, the State of Slovakia, the Kingdom of Italy, and the Independent State of Croatia. Antonescu had been made aware of the plan by German envoys, and supported it enthusiastically even before Hitler extended Romania an offer to participate. On 18 June 1941, Antonescu gave orders to his generals about \"cleansing the ground\" of Jews when Romanian forces entered Bessarabia and Bukovina. Right from the start, Antonescu proclaimed the war against the Soviet Union to be a \"holy war\", a \"crusade\" in the name of Eastern Orthodox faith and the Romanian race against the forces of \"Judeo-Bolshevism\". The propaganda of the Antonescu regime demonized everything Jewish as Antonescu believed that Communism was invented by the Jews, and all of the Soviet leaders were really Jews. Reflecting Antonescu's anti-Slavic feelings, despite the fact that the war was billed as a \"crusade\" in defence of Orthodoxy against \"Judeo-Bolshevism\", the war was not presented as a struggle to liberate the Orthodox Russians and Ukrainians from Communism; instead rule by \"Judeo-Bolshevism\" was portrayed as something brought about the innate moral inferiority of the Slavs, who thus needed to be ruled by the Germans and the Romanians. The Romanian force engaged formed a \"General Antonescu Army Group\" under the effective command of German general Eugen Ritter von Schobert. Romania's campaign on the Eastern Front began without a formal declaration of war, and was consecrated by Antonescu's statement: \"Soldiers, I order you, cross the Prut River\" (in reference to the Bessarabian border between Romania and post-1940 Soviet territory). A few days after this, a large-scale pogrom was carried out in Ia\u0219i with Antonescu's agreement; thousands of Jews were killed in the bloody Ia\u0219i pogrom. Antonescu had followed a generation of younger right-wing Romanian intellectuals led by Corneliu Zelea Codreanu who in the 1920s\u201330s had rejected the traditional Francophilia of the Romanian elites and their adherence to Western notions of universal democratic values and human rights. Antonescu made it clear that his regime rejected the moral principles of the \"demo-liberal world\" and he saw the war as an ideological struggle between his spiritually pure \"national-totalitarian regime\" vs. \"Jewish morality\". Antonescu believed that the liberal humanist-democratic-capitalist values of the West and Communism were both invented by the Jews to destroy Romania. In a lengthy speech just before the war, Antonescu attacked democracy in the most violent terms as it allowed Jews equal rights and thus to undercut the Romanian \"national idea\". As such, Antonescu stated what was needed was a \"new man\" who would be \"tough\", \"virile\" and willing to fight for an ethnically and religiously \"pure\" Romania. Despite his quarrel with Sima, much of Antonescu's speech clearly reflected the influence of the ideas of the Iron Guard that Antonescu had absorbed in the 1930s. Antonescu's anti-Semitism and sexism went so far that he tacitly condoned the rape of Jewish women and girls in Bessarabia and northern Bukovinia by his forces under the grounds that he was going take away all of the property that the Jews had \"stolen\" from the Romanians, and as far he was concerned, Jewish females were just another piece of property. Since the Jewish women were going to be exterminated anyway, Antonescu felt there was nothing wrong about letting his soldiers and gendarmes have \"some fun\" before shooting them.\nAfter becoming the first Romanian to be granted the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, which he received from Hitler at their 6 August meeting in the Ukrainian city of Berdychiv, Antonescu was promoted to Marshal of Romania by royal decree on 22 August, in recognition for his role in restoring the eastern frontiers of Greater Romania. In a report to Berlin, a German diplomat wrote that Marshal Antonescu had syphilis and that \"among [Romanian] cavalry officers this disease is as widespread as a common cold is among German officers. The Marshal suffers from severe attacks of it every several months.\" Antonescu took one of his most debated decisions when, with Bessarabia's conquest almost complete, he committed Romania to Hitler's war effort beyond the Dniester\u2014that is, beyond territory that had been part of Romania between the wars\u2014and thrust deeper into Soviet territory, thus waging a war of aggression. On 30 August, Romania occupied a territory it deemed \"Transnistria\", formerly a part of the Ukrainian SSR (including the entire Moldavian ASSR and further territories). Like the decision to continue the war beyond Bessarabia, this earned Antonescu much criticism from the semi-clandestine PNL and PN\u021a. Insofar as the war against the Soviet Union was a war to recover Bessarabia and northern Bukovina \u2013 both regions that been a part of Romania until June 1940 and that had Romanian majorities \u2013 the conflict had been very popular with the Romanian public opinion. But the idea of conquering Transnistria was not as that region had never been part of Romania, and a minority of the people were ethnic Romanian. Soon after the takeover, the area was assigned to a civil administration apparatus headed by Gheorghe Alexianu and became the site for the main component of the Holocaust in Romania: a mass deportation of the Bessarabian and Ukrainian Jews, followed later by transports of Romani Romanians and Jews from Moldavia proper (that is, the portions of Moldavia west of the Prut).\nThe accord over Transnistria's administration, signed in Tighina, also placed areas between the Dniester and the Dnieper under Romanian military occupation, while granting control over all resources to Germany. In September 1941, Antonescu ordered Romanian forces to take Odessa, a prize he badly wanted for reasons of prestige. Russians had traditionally been seen in Romania as brutal aggressors, and for Romanian forces to take a major Soviet city and one of the largest Black Sea ports like Odessa would be a sign of how far Romania had been \"regenerated\" under Antonescu's leadership. Much to Antonescu's intense fury, the Red Army were able to halt the Romanian offensive on Odessa and 24 September 1941 Antonescu had to reluctantly ask for the help of the Wehrmacht with the drive on Odessa. On 16 October 1941 Odessa fell to the German-Romanian forces. The Romanian losses had been so heavy that the area around Odessa was known to the Romanian Army as the Vale of Tears. Antonescu's anti-Semitism was sharpened by the Odessa fighting as he was convinced that the only reason why the Red Army had fought so fiercely around Odessa was that the average Russian soldier had been terrorized by bloodthirsty Jewish commissars into fighting hard. When Wilhelm Filderman wrote a letter to Antonescu complaining about the murder of Jews in Odessa, Antonescu wrote back: \"Your Jews, who have become Soviet commissars, are driving Soviet soldiers in the Odessa region into a futile bloodbath, through horrendous terror techniques as the Russian prisoners themselves have admitted, simply to cause us heavy losses\". Antonescu ended his letter with the claim that Russian Jewish commissars had savagely tortured Romanian POWs and that the entire Jewish community of Romania, Filderman included were morally responsible for all of the losses and sufferings of the Romanians around Odessa. In the fall of 1941, Antonescu planned to deport all of the Jews of the \"Regat\", southern Bukovina and southern Transylvania into Transnistria as the prelude to killing them, but this operation was vetoed by Germany, who complained that Antonescu had not finished killing the Jews of Transnistria yet. This veto was largely motivated by bureaucratic politics, namely if Antonescu exterminated all of the Jews of Romania himself, there would be nothing for the SS and the \"Ausw\u00e4rtiges Amt\" to do. Killinger informed Antonescu that Germany would reduce its supplies of arms if Antonescu went ahead with his plans to deport the Jews of the \"Regat\" into Transnistria and told him he would be better off deporting the Jews to the death camps in Poland that the Germans were already busy building. Since Romania had almost no arms industry of its own and was almost entirely dependent upon weapons from Germany to fight the war, Antonescu had little choice, but to comply with Killinger's request.\nReversal of fortunes.\nThe Romanian Army's inferior arms, insufficient armour and lack of training had been major concerns for the German commanders since before the start of the operation. One of the earliest major obstacles Antonescu encountered on the Eastern Front was the resistance of Odessa, a Soviet port on the Black Sea. Refusing any German assistance, he ordered the Romanian Army to maintain a two-month siege on heavily fortified and well-defended positions. The ill-equipped 4th Army suffered losses of some 100,000 men. Antonescu's popularity again rose in October, when the fall of Odessa was celebrated triumphantly with a parade through Bucharest's \"Arcul de Triumf\", and when many Romanians reportedly believed the war was as good as won. In Odessa itself, the aftermath included a large-scale massacre of the Jewish population, ordered by the Marshal as retaliation for a bombing which killed a number of Romanian officers and soldiers (General Ioan Glogojeanu among them). The city subsequently became the administrative capital of Transnistria. According to one account, the Romanian administration planned to change Odessa's name to \"Antonescu\". Antonescu planned that, once the war against the Soviet Union was won, he would invade Hungary to take back Transylvania and Bulgaria to take back the Dobruja with Antonescu being especially keen on the former. Antonescu planned on attacking Hungary to recover Transylvania at the first opportunity and regarded Romanian involvement on the Eastern Front in part as a way of proving to Hitler that Romania was a better German ally than Hungary, and thus deserving of German support when the planned Romanian-Hungarian war began. The \"Conduc\u0103tor\" had also created an intra-Axis alliance against Hungary along with Croatia and Slovakia.\nAs the Soviet Union recovered from the initial shock and slowed down the Axis offensive at the Battle of Moscow (October 1941 \u2013 January 1942), Romania was asked by its allies to contribute a larger number of troops. A decisive factor in Antonescu's compliance with the request appears to have been a special visit to Bucharest by Wehrmacht chief of staff Wilhelm Keitel, who introduced the \"Conduc\u0103tor\" to Hitler's plan for attacking the Caucasus &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;. The Romanian force engaged in the war reportedly exceeded German demands. It came to around 500,000 troops and thirty actively involved divisions. As a sign of his satisfaction, Hitler presented his Romanian counterpart with a luxury car. On 7 December 1941, after reflecting on the possibility for Romania, Hungary and Finland to change their stance, the British government responded to repeated Soviet requests and declared war on all three countries. Following Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor and in compliance with its Axis commitment, Romania declared war on the United States within five days. These developments contrasted with Antonescu's own statement of 7 December: \"I am an ally of the [German] Reich against [the Soviet Union], I am neutral in the conflict between Great Britain and Germany. I am for America against the Japanese.\"\nA crucial change in the war came with the Battle of Stalingrad in June 1942 \u2013 February 1943, a major defeat for the Axis. Romania's armies alone lost some 150,000 men (either dead, wounded or captured) and more than half of the country's divisions were wiped out. \nThe loss of two entire Romanian armies who all either killed or captured by the Soviets produced a major crisis in German-Romanian relations in the winter of 1943 with many people in the Romanian government for the first time questioning the wisdom of fighting on the side of the Axis. Outside of the elites, by 1943 the continuing heavy losses on the Eastern Front, anger at the contempt which the Wehrmacht treated their Romanian allies and declining living standards within Romania made the war unpopular with the Romanian people, and consequently the \"Conduc\u0103tor\" himself. The American historian Gerhard Weinberg wrote that: \"The string of broken German promises of equipment and support, the disregard of warnings about Soviet offensive preparations, the unfriendly treatment of retreating Romanian units by German officers and soldiers and the general German tendency to blame their own miscalculations and disasters on their allies all combined to produce a real crisis in German-Romanian relations.\" For part of that interval, the Marshal had withdrawn from public life, owing to an unknown affliction, which is variously rumoured to have been a mental breakdown, a foodborne illness or a symptom of the syphilis he had contracted earlier in life. He is known to have been suffering from digestive problems, treating himself with food prepared by Helene von Exner, an Austrian-born dietitian who moved into Hitler's service after 1943. \nUpon his return, Antonescu blamed the Romanian losses on German overseer Arthur Hauffe, whom Hitler agreed to replace. In parallel with the military losses, Romania was confronted with large-scale economic problems. Romania's oil was the \"Reich\"'s only source of natural oil after the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 to August 1944 (Germany also had synthetic oil plants operating from 1942 onwards), and as such for economic reasons, Romania was always treated as a major ally by Hitler. While Germany monopolized Romania's exports, it defaulted on most of its payments. Like all countries whose exports to Germany, particularly in oil, exceeded imports from that country, Romania's economy suffered from Nazi control of the exchange rate &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;. On the German side, those directly involved in harnessing Romania's economic output for German goals were economic planners Hermann G\u00f6ring and Walther Funk, together with Hermann Neubacher, the Special Representative for Economic Problems. A recurring problem for Antonescu was attempting to obtain payments for all of the oil he shipped to Germany while resisting German demands for increased oil production. The situation was further aggravated in 1942, as USAAF and RAF were able to bomb the oil fields in Prahova County &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;. Official sources from the following period amalgamate military and civilian losses of all kinds, which produces a total of 554,000 victims of the war. To improve the Romanian army's effectiveness, the Mare\u0219al tank destroyer was developed starting in late 1942. Marshal Antonescu, after whom the vehicle was named, was involved in the project himself. The vehicle later influenced the development of the German Hetzer.\nIn this context, the Romanian leader acknowledged that Germany was losing the war, and he therefore authorized his Deputy Premier and new Foreign Minister Mihai Antonescu to set up contacts with the Allies. In early 1943, Antonescu authorized his diplomats to contact British and American diplomats in Portugal and Switzerland to see if were possible for Romania to sign an armistice with the Western powers. The Romanian diplomats were informed that no armistice was possible until an armistice was signed with the Soviet Union, a condition Antonescu rejected. In parallel, he allowed the PN\u021a and the PNL to engage in parallel talks with the Allies at various locations in neutral countries. The discussions were strained by the Western Allies' call for an unconditional surrender, over which the Romanian envoys bargained with Allied diplomats in Sweden and Egypt (among them the Soviet representatives Nikolai Novikov and Alexandra Kollontai). Antonescu was also alarmed by the possibility of war being carried on Romanian territory, as had happened in Italy after Operation Avalanche. The events also prompted hostile negotiations aimed at toppling Antonescu, and involving the two political parties, the young monarch, diplomats and soldiers. A major clash between Michael and Antonescu took place during the first days of 1943, when the 21-year-old monarch used his New Year's address on national radio to part with the Axis war effort.\nOuster and arrest.\nIn March 1944, the Soviet Red Army broke the Southern Bug and Dniester fronts, advancing on Bessarabia. This came just as Field Marshal Henry Maitland Wilson, the British Supreme Allied Commander of the Mediterranean theatre, presented Antonescu with an ultimatum. After a new visit to Germany and a meeting with Hitler, Antonescu opted to continue fighting alongside the remaining Axis states, a decision which he later claimed was motivated by Hitler's promise to allow Romania possession of Northern Transylvania in the event of an Axis victory. Upon his return, the \"Conduc\u0103tor\" oversaw a counteroffensive which stabilized the front on a line between Ia\u0219i and Chi\u0219in\u0103u to the north and the lower Dniester to the east. This normalized his relations with Nazi German officials, whose alarm over the possible loss of an ally had resulted in the \"Margarethe II\" plan, an adapted version of the Nazi takeover in Hungary.\nHowever, Antonescu's non-compliance with the terms of Wilson's ultimatum also had drastic effects on Romania's ability to exit the war. By then, Antonescu was conceiving of a separate peace with the Western Allies, while maintaining contacts with the Soviets. In parallel, the mainstream opposition movement came to establish contacts with the Romanian Communist Party (PCR), which, although minor numerically, gained importance for being the only political group to be favoured by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. On the PCR side, the discussions involved Lucre\u021biu P\u0103tr\u0103\u0219canu and later Emil Bodn\u0103ra\u0219. Another participating group at this stage was the old Romanian Social Democratic Party.\nLarge-scale Allied bombings of Bucharest took place in spring 1944, while the Soviet Red Army approached Romanian borders. The Battle for Romania began in late summer: while German commanders Johannes Frie\u00dfner and Otto W\u00f6hler of the Army Group South Ukraine attempted to hold Bukovina, Soviet Steppe Front leader Rodion Malinovsky stormed into the areas of Moldavia defended by Petre Dumitrescu's troops. In reaction, Antonescu attempted to stabilize the front on a line between Foc\u0219ani, N\u0103moloasa and Br\u0103ila, deep inside Romanian territory. On 5 August, he visited Hitler one final time in K\u0119trzyn. On this occasion, the German leader reportedly explained that his people had betrayed the Nazi cause, and asked him if Romania would go on fighting (to which Antonescu reportedly answered in vague terms). After Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov more than once stated that the Soviet Union was not going to require Romanian subservience, the factions opposing Antonescu agreed that the moment had come to overthrow him, by carrying out the Royal Coup of 23 August. On that day, the sovereign asked Antonescu to meet him in the Royal Palace, where he presented him with a request to take Romania out of its Axis alliance. The \"Conduc\u0103tor\" refused, and was promptly arrested by soldiers of the guard, being replaced as Premier with General Constantin S\u0103n\u0103tescu, who presided over a national government.\nThe new Romanian authorities declared peace with the Allies and advised the population to greet Soviet troops. On 25 August, as Bucharest was successfully defending itself against German retaliations, Romania declared war on Nazi Germany. The events disrupted German domination in the Balkans, putting a stop to the \"Maibaum\" offensive against Yugoslav Partisans. The coup was nevertheless a unilateral move, and, until the signature of an armistice on 12 September, the country was still perceived as an enemy by the Soviets, who continued to take Romanian soldiers as prisoners of war. In parallel, Hitler reactivated the Iron Guardist exile, creating a Sima-led government in exile that did not survive the war's end in Europe.\nPlaced in the custody of PCR militants, Antonescu spent the interval at a house in Bucharest's Vatra Luminoas\u0103 quarter. He was afterward handed to the Soviet occupation forces, who transported him to Moscow, together with his deputy Mihai Antonescu, Governor of Transnistria Gheorghe Alexianu, defence minister Constantin Pantazi, Gendarmerie commander Constantin Vasiliu and Bucharest Police chief Mircea Elefterescu. They were subsequently kept in luxurious detention at a mansion nearby the city, and guarded by SMERSH, a special counter-intelligence body answering directly to Stalin. Shortly after Germany surrendered in May 1945, the group was moved to Lubyanka prison. There, Antonescu was interrogated and reputedly pressured by SMERSH operatives, among them Viktor Abakumov, but transcripts of their conversations were never sent back to Romania by the Soviet authorities. Later research noted that the main issues discussed were the German-Romanian alliance, the war on the Soviet Union, the economic toll on both countries, and Romania's participation in the Holocaust (defined specifically as crimes against \"peaceful Soviet citizens\"). At some point during this period, Antonescu attempted suicide in his quarters. He was returned to Bucharest in spring 1946 and held in Jilava Prison. He was subsequently interrogated by prosecutor Avram Bunaciu, to whom he complained about the conditions of his detainment, contrasting them with those in Moscow, while explaining that he was a vegetarian and demanding a special diet.\nTrial and execution.\nIn May 1946, Antonescu was prosecuted at the first in a series of People's Tribunals, on charges of war crimes, crimes against the peace and treason. The tribunals had first been proposed by the PN\u021a, and were comparable to the Nuremberg Trials in Allied-occupied Germany. The Romanian legislative framework was drafted by coup participant P\u0103tr\u0103\u0219canu, a PCR member who had been granted leadership of the Justice Ministry. Despite the idea having earned support from several sides of the political spectrum, the procedures were politicized in a sense favourable to the PCR and the Soviet Union, and posed a legal problem for being based on \"ex post facto\" decisions. The first such local trial took place in 1945, resulting in the sentencing of Iosif Iacobici, Nicolae Macici, Constantin Trestioreanu and other military commanders directly involved in planning or carrying out the Odessa massacre.\nAntonescu was represented by Constantin Paraschivescu-B\u0103l\u0103ceanu and Titus Stoica, two public defenders whom he had first consulted with a day before the procedures were initiated. The prosecution team, led by Vasile Stoican, and the panel of judges, presided over by Alexandru Voitinovici, were infiltrated by PCR supporters. Both consistently failed to admit that Antonescu's foreign policies were overall dictated by Romania's positioning between Germany and the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, and although references to the mass murders formed just 23% of the indictment and corpus of evidence (ranking below charges of anti-Soviet aggression), the procedures also included Antonescu's admission of and self-exculpating take on war crimes, including the deportations to Transnistria. They also evidence his awareness of the Odessa massacre, accompanied by his claim that few of the deaths were his direct responsibility. One notable event at the trial was a testimony by PN\u021a leader Iuliu Maniu. Reacting against the aggressive tone of other accusers, Maniu went on record saying: \"We [Maniu and Antonescu] were political adversaries, not cannibals.\" Upon leaving the bench, Maniu walked toward Antonescu and shook his hand.\nIon Antonescu was found guilty of the charges. This verdict was followed by two sets of appeals, which claimed that the restored and amended 1923 Constitution did not offer a framework for the People's Tribunals and prevented capital punishment during peacetime, while noting that, contrary to the armistice agreement, only one power represented within the Allied Commission had supervised the tribunal. They were both rejected within six days, in compliance with a legal deadline on the completion of trials by the People's Tribunals. King Michael subsequently received pleas for clemency from Antonescu's lawyer and his mother, and reputedly considered asking the Allies to reassess the case as part of the actual Nuremberg Trials, taking Romanian war criminals into foreign custody. Subjected to pressures by the new Soviet-backed Petru Groza executive, he issued a decree in favour of execution. Together with his co-defendants Mihai Antonescu, Alexianu and Vasiliu, the former \"Conduc\u0103tor\" was executed by a military firing squad on 1 June 1946. Antonescu supporters circulated false rumours that regular soldiers had refused to fire at their commander, and that the squad was mostly composed of Jewish policemen. Another apologetic claim insists that he himself ordered the squad to shoot, but footage of the event has proven it false. However, he did refuse a blindfold and raised his hat in salute once the order was given. The execution site, some distance away from the locality of Jilava and the prison fort, was known as \"Valea Piersicilor\" (\"Valley of the Peach Trees\"). His final written statement was a letter to his wife, urging her to withdraw into a convent, while stating the belief that posterity would reconsider his deeds and accusing Romanians of being \"ungrateful\".\nIdeology.\nEthnic nationalism and expansionism.\nAntonescu's policies were motivated, in large part, by ethnic nationalism. A firm believer in the restoration of Greater Romania as the union of lands inhabited by ethnic Romanians, he never reconciled himself to Hungary's incorporation of Northern Transylvania. Although Hungary and Romania were technically allied through the Axis system, their relationship was always tense, and marked by serious diplomatic incidents. The Romanian leader kept contacts with representatives of ethnic Romanian communities directly affected by the Second Vienna Award, including Transylvanian Greek-Catholic clergy. Another aspect of Antonescu's nationalist policies was evidenced after the Balkans Campaign. Antonescu's Romania did not partake in the military action, but laid a claim to the territories in eastern Vojvodina (western Banat) and the Timok Valley, home to a sizeable Romanian community. Reportedly, Germany's initial designs of granting Vojvodina to Hungary enhanced the tensions between Antonescu and Mikl\u00f3s Horthy to the point where war between the two countries became a possibility. Such incidents made Germany indefinitely prolong its occupation of the region. The Romanian authorities issued projects for an independent Macedonia with autonomy for its Aromanian communities, while an official memorandum on the Timok Valley, approved by Antonescu, made mention of \"Romanian\" areas \"from Timok [...] to Salonika\". The \"Conduc\u0103tor\" also maintained contacts with Aromanian fascists in Axis-occupied Greece, awarding refuge to Alcibiades Diamandi and Nicola Matussi of the Roman Legion, whose pro-Romanian policies had brought them into conflict with other Aromanian factions.\n\"Conduc\u0103tor\" Antonescu thought Hitler willing to revise his stance on Northern Transylvania, and claimed to have obtained the German leader's agreement, using it to justify participation on the Eastern Front after the recovery of Bessarabia. However, transcripts of the Hitler-Antonescu conversations do not validate his interpretation. Another version has it that Hitler sent Antonescu a letter informing him that Bessarabia's political status still ultimately depended on German decisions. In one of his letters to Hitler, Antonescu himself stated his anti-communist ideological motivation: \"I confirm that I will pursue operations in the east to the end against that great enemy of civilization, of Europe, and of my country: Russian Bolshevism [...] I will not be swayed by anyone not to extend this military cooperation into new territory.\" Antonescu's ideological perspective blended national sentiment with generically Christian and particularly Romanian Orthodox traits. British historian Arnold D. Harvey writes that while this ideology seems a poor match with Nazi doctrine, especially its anti-religious elements, \"It seems that Hitler was not even perturbed by the militant Christian orientation of the Antonescu regime\".\nIt is also possible that, contrary to Antonescu's own will, Hitler viewed the transfer of Transnistria as compensation for the Transylvanian areas, and that he therefore considered the matter closed. According to the Romanian representative in Berlin, Raoul Bossy, various German and Hungarian officials recommended the extension of permanent Romanian rule into Transnistria, as well as into Podolia, Galicia and Pokuttya, in exchange for delivering the whole of Transylvania to Hungary (and relocating its ethnic Romanian majority to the new provinces). American political scientist Charles King writes: \"There was never any attempt to annex the occupied territory [of Transnistria], for it was generally considered by the Romanian government to be a temporary buffer zone between Greater Romania and the Soviet front line.\" At his 1946 trial, Antonescu claimed that Transnistria had been occupied to prevent Romania being caught in a \"pincer\" between Germany's \"Drang nach Osten\" and the \"Volksdeutsch\" communities to the east, while denying charges of having exploited the region for Romania's benefit.\nRomanian historian Lucian Boia believes that Antonescu may have nevertheless had expansionist goals to the east, and that he implicitly understood Operation Barbarossa as a tool for containing Slavic peoples. Similar verdicts are provided by other researchers. Another Romanian historian, Ottmar Tra\u0219c\u0103, argues that Antonescu did not wish to annex the region \"at least until the end of the war\", but notes that Antonescu's own statements make reference to its incorporation in the event of a victory. In addition to early annexation plans to the Southern Bug (reportedly confessed to Bossy in June 1941), the \"Conduc\u0103tor\" is known to have presented his ministers with designs for the region's colonization. The motivation he cited was alleged malnutrition among Romanian peasants, to which he added: \"I'll take this population, I'll lead it into Transnistria, where I shall give it all the land it requires\". Several nationalists sympathetic to Antonescu acclaimed the extension of Romanian rule into Transnistria, which they understood as permanent.\nAntisemitism and antiziganism.\nA recurring element in Antonescu's doctrines is racism, and in particular antisemitism. This was linked to his sympathy for ethnocratic ideals, and complemented by his statements in favour of \"integral nationalism\" and \"Romanianism\". Like other far right Romanians, he saw a Jewish presence behind liberal democracy, and believed in the existence of Judeo-Masonry. His earliest thoughts on Codreanu's ideology criticize the Legionary leader for advocating \"brutal measures\" in dealing with the \"invasion of Jews\", and instead propose \"the organization of Romanian classes\" as a method for reaching the same objective. Politician Aureliu Weiss, who met General Antonescu during that interval, recalled that, although antisemitic \"to the core\", he was capable of restraint in public. According to historian Mihail Ionescu, the \"Conduc\u0103tor\" was not averse to the Iron Guard's \"Legionary principles\", but wanted antisemitism to be \"applied in an orderly fashion\", as opposed to Horia Sima's revolutionary ways. Historian Ioan Scurtu believes that, during the Legionary Rebellion, Antonescu deliberately waited before stepping in, in order for the Guard to be \"profoundly discredited\" and for himself to be perceived as a \"saviour\". In April 1941, he let his ministers know that he was considering letting \"the mob\" deal with the Jews, \"and after the slaughter, I will restore order.\" Lucian Boia notes that the Romanian leader was indeed motivated by antisemitic beliefs, but that these need to be contextualized in order to understand what separates Antonescu from Hitler in terms of radicalism. However, various other researchers assess that, by aligning himself with Hitler before and during Operation Barbarossa, Antonescu implicitly agreed with his thoughts on the \"Jewish Question\", choosing racial over religious antisemitism. According to Harvey, the Ia\u0219i pogrom made the Germans \"evidently willing to accept that organized Christianity in Romania was very different from what it was in Germany\".\nAntonescu was a firm believer in the conspiracy theory of \"Jewish Bolshevism\", according to which all Jews were supporters of communism and the Soviet Union. His arguments on the matter involved a spurious claim that, during the 1940 retreat from Bessarabia, the Jews had organized themselves and attacked Romanian soldiers. In part, this notion exaggerated unilateral reports of enthusiasm among the marginalized Jews upon the arrival of Red Army troops. In a summer 1941 address to his ministers, Antonescu stated: \"The Satan is the Jew. [Ours] is a battle of life and death. Either we win and the world will be purified, either they win and we will become their slaves.\" At around the same time, he envisaged the ethnic cleansing (\"cleaning out\") of Jews from the eastern Romanian-held territories. However, as early as February 1941, Antonescu was also contemplating the ghettoization of all Jewish Romanians, as an early step toward their expulsion. In this context, Antonescu frequently depicted Jews as a disease or a poison. After the Battle of Stalingrad, he encouraged the army commanders to resist the counteroffensive, as otherwise the Soviets \"will bring Bolshevism to the country, wipe out the entire leadership stratum, impose the Jews on us, and deport masses of our people.\"\nIon Antonescu's antiziganism manifested itself as the claim that some or all Romani people, specifically nomadic ones, were given to criminal behaviour. The regime did not act consistently on this belief: in various cases, those deported had close relatives drafted into the Romanian Army. Although racist slogans targeting Romani people had been popularized by the Iron Guard, it was only under Antonescu's unchallenged rule that solving the \"Gypsy problem\" became official policy and antiziganist measures were enforced. After a February 1941 inspection, Antonescu singled out Bucharest's Romani community for alleged offences committed during the blackout, and called on his ministers to present him with solutions. Initially, he contemplated sending all Romani people he considered undesirable to the inhospitable B\u0103r\u0103gan Plain, to join the ranks of a local community of manual labourers. In 1942, he commissioned the Romanian Central Institute for Statistics to compile a report on Romani demography, which, in its edited form, provided scientifically racist conclusions, warning the \"Conduc\u0103tor\" about alleged Romani-Romanian miscegenation in rural Romania. In doing so, Antonescu offered some credit to a marginal and pseudoscientific trend in Romanian sociology, which, basing itself on eugenic theories, recommended the marginalization, deportation or compulsory sterilization of the Romani people, whose numeric presence it usually exaggerated. Among those who signed the report was demographer Sabin Manuil\u0103, who saw the Romani presence as a major racial problem. The exact effect of the report's claims on Antonescu is uncertain.\nFascism and conservatism.\nThere is a historiographic dispute about whether Antonescu's regime was fascist or more generically right-wing authoritarian, itself integrated within a larger debate about the aspects and limits of fascism. Israeli historian of fascism Zeev Sternhell describes Antonescu, alongside his European counterparts Pierre-\u00c9tienne Flandin, Francisco Franco, Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, Fran\u00e7ois de La Rocque, Philippe P\u00e9tain and Italian King Victor Emmanuel III, as a \"conservative\", noting that all of them \"were not deceived by a [fascist] propaganda trying to place them in the same category [as the fascist movements].\" A similar verdict is provided by German historian of Europe Hagen Schulze, who views Horthy, Franco and the Romanian leader alongside Portugal's \"Estado Novo\" theorist Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar and Second Polish Republic founder J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski, as rulers of \"either purely military dictatorships, or else authoritarian governments run by civilian politicians\", and thus a category apart from the leaders of \"Fascist states.\" For Schulze, the defining elements of such governments is the presence of a \"conservative establishment\" which ensured \"social stability\" by extending the control of a \"traditional state\" (thus effectively blocking \"revolutionary suggestions\" from the far left and the far right alike). The term \"conservative autocrat\" is used in relation to the \"Conduc\u0103tor\" by British political theorist Roger Griffin, who attributes to the Iron Guard the position of a subservient fascist movement, while others identify Antonescu's post-1941 rule as a military rather than a fascist dictatorship. Several other scholars prefer \"conservative\" as a defining term for Antonescu's policies. Antonescu described himself as \"by fate a dictator\", and explained that his policies were \"militaristic\" or, on one occasion, \"national-totalitarian\".\nNevertheless, other historians theorize a synthesis of fascist and conservative elements, performed by Antonescu and other European leaders of his day. Routledge's 2002 \"Companion to Fascism and the Far Right\" uses the terms \"para-fascist\" to define Antonescu, adding: \"generally regarded as an authoritarian conservative [Antonescu] incorporated fascism into his regime, in the shape of the Iron Guard, rather than embodying fascism himself.\" \"Para-fascist\" is also used by Griffin, to denote both Antonescu and Carol II. American historian of fascism Robert Paxton notes that, like Salazar, Romania's dictator crushed a competing fascist movement, \"after copying some of [its] techniques of popular mobilization.\" Political scientists John Gledhill and Charles King discuss the Iron Guard as Romania's \"indigenous fascist movement\", remark that Antonescu \"adopted much of the ideology of the Guardists\", and conclude that the regime he led was \"openly fascist\". References to the fascist traits of Antonescu's dictatorship are also made by other researchers.\nThe synthetic aspect of Antonescu's rule is discussed in detail by various authors. British historian Dennis Deletant, who notes that the fascist label relies on both Antonescu's adoption of some fascist \"trappings\" and the \"dichotomy of wartime and postwar evaluation\" of his regime, also notes that post-1960 interpretations \"do more to explain his behaviour than the preceding orthodoxy.\" Deletant contrasts the lack of \"mass political party or ideology\" with the type of rule associated with Nazism or Italian fascism. British-born sociologist and political analyst Michael Mann writes: \"The authoritarian regimes of Antonescu [...] and Franco [...] purported to be 'traditional', but actually their fascist-derived corporatism was a new immanent ideology of the right.\" Another distinct view is held by Romanian-born historian of ideas Juliana Geran Pilon, who describes Romania's \"military fascist regime\" as a successor to Iron Guardist \"mystical nationalism\", while mentioning that Antonescu's \"national ideology was rather more traditionally militaristic and conservative.\"\nPower base, administration and propaganda.\nIn theory, Antonescu's policies had at least one revolutionary aspect. The leader himself claimed: \"I want to introduce a patriotic, heroic, military-typed education, because economic education and all the others follow from it.\" According to Boia, his arrival in power was explicitly meant to \"regenerate\" Romania, and his popularity hinged on his being perceived as a \"totalitarian model\" and a \"saviour\" figure, like Corneliu Zelea Codreanu and Carol II before him. The \"providential\" and \"saviour\" themes are also emphasized by historian Adrian Majuru, who notes that Antonescu both adopted such ideals and criticized Carol for failing to live up to them. Seeing his rule as legitimized by the national interest, the general is also known to have referred to political pluralism as \"poltronerie\" (\"poltroonishness\"). Accordingly, Antonescu formally outlawed all political forces in February 1941, codifying penal labour as punishment for most public forms of political expression. In Deletant's assessment, his regenerative program was more declarative than factual, and contradicted by Antonescu's own decision to allow the informal existence of some opposition forces. At the same time, some historians believe his monopolizing of power in the name of a German alliance turned Romania into either a \"puppet state\" of Hitler or one of Germany's \"satellite\" governments. However, Deletant notes: \"Romania retained her sovereignty throughout the period of the alliance [with Nazi Germany]. [...] Antonescu had, of course, his own country's interests uppermost in his mind, but in following Hitler, he served the Nazi cause.\" He describes Romania's contribution to the war as that of \"a principal ally of Germany\", as opposed to a \"minor Axis satellite.\"\nAlthough he assigned an unimportant role to King Michael, Antonescu took steps to increase the monarchy's prestige, personally inviting Carol's estranged wife, Queen Mother Helen, to return home. However, his preferred military structures functioned in cooperation with a bureaucracy inherited from the National Renaissance Front. According to historian of fascism Philip Morgan: \"Antonescu probably wanted to create, or perpetuate, something like Carol's front organization.\" Much of his permanent support base comprised former National Christian Party members, to the point where he was seen as successor to Octavian Goga. While maintaining a decorative replacement for Parliament\u2014known as \"Adunarea Ob\u0219teasc\u0103 Plebiscitar\u0103 a Na\u021biunii Rom\u00e2ne\" (\"The General Plebiscitary Assembly of the Romanian Nation\") and convoked only twice\u2014 he took charge of hierarchical appointments, and personally drafted new administrative projects. In 1941, he disestablished participative government in localities and counties, replacing it with a corporatist structure appointed by prefects whom he named. In stages between August and October 1941, he instituted civilian administration of Transnistria under Governor Gheorghe Alexianu, whose status he made equivalent to that of a cabinet minister. Similar measures were taken in Bukovina and Bessarabia (under Governors Corneliu Calotescu and Gheorghe Voiculescu, respectively). Antonescu strictly relied on the chain of command, and his direct orders to the Army overrode civilian hierarchies. This system allowed room for endemic political corruption and administrative confusion. The Romanian leader also tolerated a gradual loss of authority over the German communities in Romania, in particular the Transylvanian Saxon and Banat Swabian groups, in agreement with Hitler's views on the \"Volksdeutsche\". This trend was initiated by Saxon Nazi activist Andreas Schmidt in cooperation with the \"Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle\", resulting in \"de facto\" self-governance under a Nazi system which was also replicated among the 130,000 Black Sea Germans of Transnistria. Many young German Romanian men opted to join the \"Schutzstaffel\" as early as 1940 and, in 1943, an accord between Antonescu and Hitler automatically sent ethnic Germans of recruitable age into the Wehrmacht.\nThe regime was characterized by the leader's attempts to regulate even remote aspects of public life, including relations between the sexes. He imposed drastic penalties for misdemeanors, and the legal use of capital punishment was extended to an unprecedented level. He personally set standards for nightclub programs, for the length of skirts and for women's use of bicycles, while forcing all men to wear coats in public. His wife Maria was a patron of state-approved charitable organizations, initially designed to compete with successful Iron Guardist ventures such as \"Ajutorul Legionar\". According to Romanian-born gender studies academic Maria Bucur, although the regime allowed women \"to participate in the war effort on the front in a more regularized, if still marginal, fashion\", the general tone was sexist.\nThe administrative apparatus included official press and propaganda sectors, which moved rapidly from constructing Carol's personality cult to doing the same for the new military leader: journals \"Universul\" and \"Timpul\", as well as Camil Petrescu's \"Rom\u00e2nia\" magazine, were particularly active in this process. Some other such venues were \"Porunca Vremii\", Nichifor Crainic's \"Sfarm\u0103-Piatr\u0103\", as well as all the seemingly independent newspapers and some ten new periodicals the government founded for this purpose. Among the individual journalists involved in propaganda were Crainic, Petrescu, Stelian Popescu, and \"Curentul\" editor Pamfil \u0218eicaru (the \"Conduc\u0103tor\" purposefully ignored support from Carol's former adviser, corporatist economist and newspaperman Mihail Manoilescu, whom he reportedly despised). Much of the propaganda produced during the Antonescu era supported the antisemitic theses put forth by the \"Conduc\u0103tor\". Antisemitism was notable and virulent at the level of Romanian Army units addressing former Soviet citizens in occupied lands, and reflected the regime's preference for the ethnic slur \"jidani\" (akin to \"kikes\" or \"Yids\" in English). The religious aspect of anti-communism surfaced in such venues, which frequently equated Operation Barbarossa with a holy war or a crusade. Romania's other enemies were generally treated differently: Antonescu himself issued objections to the anti-British propaganda of explicitly pro-Nazi papers such as \"Porunca Vremii\". A special segment of Antonescu's post-1941 propaganda was \"Codrenist\": it revisited the Iron Guard's history to minimize Sima's contributions and to depict him as radically different from Codreanu.\nAntonescu and The Holocaust.\nIa\u0219i pogrom.\nThree weeks after gaining power and inaugurating the National Legionary regime, Antonescu declared to Italian interviewers at \"La Stampa\" that solving the \"Jewish Question\" was his pressing concern, and that he considered himself \"haunted\" by the large Jewish presence in Moldavian towns. Antonescu's crimes against the Jewish population were inaugurated by new racial discrimination laws: urban Jewish property was expropriated, Jews were banned from performing a wide range of occupations and forced to provide community work for the state (\"munc\u0103 de interes ob\u0219tesc\") instead of the inaccessible military service, mixed Romanian-Jewish marriages were forbidden and many Jews, primarily those from strategic areas such as Ploie\u0219ti, were confined to internment camps. The expulsion of Jewish professionals from all walks of life was also carried out in the National Legionary period, and enforced after the Legionary Rebellion. After a post-Legionary hiatus, \"Romanianization\" commissions resumed their work under the supervision of a National Centre, and their scope was extended.\nOften discussed as a prelude to the Holocaust in Romania and in connection with Antonescu's views on \"Jewish Bolshevism\", the Ia\u0219i pogrom occurred just days after the start of Operation Barbarossa, and was partly instigated, partly tolerated by the authorities in Bucharest. For a while before the massacre, these issued propaganda claiming that the Jews in Ia\u0219i, whose numbers had been increased by forced evictions from smaller localities, were actively helping Soviet bombers find their targets through the blackout and plotting against the authorities, with Antonescu himself ordering that the entire community be expelled from the city on such grounds. The discourse appealed to local antisemites, whose murderous rampage, carried out with the officials' complicity, resulted in several thousand deaths among Jewish men, women and children.\nIn the aftermath of the pogrom, thousands of survivors were loaded into the so-called \"death trains\". These overcrowded and sealed Romanian Railways cattle wagons circled the countryside in the extreme heat of the summer, and periodically stopped to unload the dead. At least 4,000 people died during the initial massacre and the subsequent transports. Varied estimates of the Ia\u0219i massacre and related killings place the total number of Jews killed at 8,000, 10,000, 12,000 or 14,000. Some assistance in their murder was provided by units of the German XXXth Army Corps, a matter which later allowed the authorities to shift blame from themselves and from Antonescu\u2014who was nonetheless implicated by the special orders he had released. The complicity of the Special Intelligence Service and its director Eugen Cristescu was also advanced as a possibility. The subsequent attempts at a cover-up included omissive explanations given by the central authorities to foreign diplomats and rewriting official records.\nTransnistria.\nRight upon setting up camp in Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, Romanian troops joined the Wehrmacht and the Schutzstaffel-organized \"Einsatzgruppen\" in mass shootings of Bessarabian and Ukrainian Jews, resulting in the deaths of 10,000 to 20,000 people. Scholar Christopher R. Browning compares these killings with similar atrocities perpetrated by locals in \"Reichskommissariat Ukraine\", Lithuania and Latvia &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;. From then on, as the fighting troops progressed over the Dniester, the local administration deported large numbers of Jews into the fighting zone, in hopes that they would be exterminated by the Germans. Antonescu himself stated: \"I am in favour of expelling the Jews from Bessarabia and [Northern] Bukovina to the other side of the border [...]. There is nothing for them to do here and I don't mind if we appear in history as barbarians [...]. There has never been a time more suitable in our history to get rid of the Jews, and if necessary, you are to make use of machine guns against them.\" He also explained that his aim was: \"the policy of purification of the Romanian race, and I will not give way before any obstacle in achieving this historical goal of our nation. If we do not take advantage of the situation which presents itself today [...] we shall miss the last chance that history offers to us. And I do not wish to miss it, because if I do so further generations will blame me.\" He made a contradictory statement about the murder of Jews in Chi\u0219in\u0103u, claiming that their perpetrators were \"bastards\" who \"stained\" his regime's reputation. Antonescu saw the \"war\" against the Jews as being just as important as the war against the Soviet Union, and regularly demanded reports from his officers in Bessarabia and Transnistria about their measures against the Jews. In late August 1941, in Tighina, Antonescu called a secret conference attended by himself, the governors of Bessarabia and Bukovina and the governor-designate of Transnistria to discuss his plans regarding the Jews in those regions.\nMany deaths followed, as the direct results of starvation and exhaustion, while the local German troops carried out selective shootings. The survivors were sent back over the river, and the German commanders expressed irritation over the methods applied by their counterparts. Romanian authorities subsequently introduced ghettos or transit camps. After the annexation of Transnistria, there ensued a systematic deportation of Jews from Bessarabia, with additional transports of Jews from the Old Kingdom (especially Moldavia-proper). Based on an assignment Antonescu handed down to General Ioan Topor, the decision involved specific quotas, and the transports, most of which were carried out by foot, involved random murders. In conjunction with Antonescu's expansionist ambitions, it is possible that the ultimate destination for the survivors, once circumstances permitted it, was further east than the Southern Bug. On 11 October 1941, the chief of the Federation of Jewish Communities, Wilhelm Filderman issued a public letter to Antonescu asking him to stop the deportations, writing: \"This is death, death for no reason except that they are Jews.\" Antonescu replied to Filderman in a long letter explaining that because the entire Jewish community of Bessarabia had allegedly collaborated with the Soviets during the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia, his policies were a justified act of revenge. On 11 November 1941, Antonescu sent Filderman a second letter stating no Jews would be allowed to live in the \"liberated territories\" and as for the Jews of the \"Regat\":\nWe decided to defend our Romanian rights because our all-too-tolerant past was taken advantage of by the Jews and facilitated the abuse of our rights by foreigners, particularly the Jews...We are determined to put an end to this situation. We cannot afford to put in jeopardy the existence of our nation because of several hundred thousand Jews, or in order to salvage some principle of humane democracy that has not been understood properly.\"\nThe deportees' remaining property was nationalized, confiscated or left available for plunder. With its own Jewish population confined and subjected to extermination, Transnistria became infamous in short time, especially so for its five main concentration camps: Pechora, Akhmechetka, Bogdanovka, Domanovka and Obodovka. Manned by Romanian Gendarmes and local Ukrainian auxiliaries who acted with the consent of central authorities, Transnistrian localities became the sites of mass executions, particularly after the administrators became worried about the spread of typhus from the camps and into the surrounding region. At a Cabinet meeting on 16 December 1941 to discuss the fate of the Jews of Transnistria, Antonescu stated:\nThe question of the Yids is being discussed in Berlin. The Germans want to bring the Yids from Europe to Russia and settle them in certain areas, but there is still time before this plan is carried out. Meanwhile, what should we do? Shall we wait for a decision in Berlin? Shall we wait for a decision that concerns us? Shall we ensure their safety? Pack them into catacombs! Throw them into the Black Sea! As far I am concerned, 100 may die, 1,000 may die, all of them may die\"\nBetween 21\u201324 and 28\u201331 December 1941, Romanian gendarmes and Ukrainian auxiliaries killed about 70,000 Jews at the Bogdanovca camp; the massacre was Antonescu's way of dealing with a typhus epidemic that had broken out among the Jews of Transnistria owing to the poor living conditions that had been forced to endure. The last wave of Jewish deportations, occurring in June 1942, came mainly from the Cern\u0103u\u021bi area in Northern Bukovina.\nAlso in the summer of 1942, Antonescu became a perpetrator of the \"Porajmos\", or Holocaust-related crimes against the Romani people, when he ordered the Transnistrian deportation of Romanian Romani from the Old Kingdom, transited through camps and resettled in inhumane conditions near the Southern Bug. They were joined there by 2,000 conscientious objectors of the Inochentist church, a millennialist denomination. As Antonescu admitted during his trial, he personally supervised these operations, giving special orders to the Gendarmerie commanders. In theory, the measures taken against Romani people were supposed to affect only nomads and those with a criminal record created or updated recently, but arbitrary exceptions were immediately made to this rule, in particular by using the vague notion of \"undesirable\" to define some members of sedentary communities. The central authorities noted differences in the criteria applied locally, and intervened to prevent or sanction under-deportation and, in some cases, over-deportation. Antonescu and Constantin Vasiliu had been made aware of the problems Transnistria faced in feeding its own population, but ignored them when deciding in favour of expulsion. With most of their property confiscated, the Romani men, women and children were only allowed to carry hand luggage, on which they were supposed to survive winter. Famine and disease ensued from criminal negligence, Romani survival being largely dependent on occasional government handouts, the locals' charity, stealing and an underground economy. Once caught, escapees who made their way back into Romania were returned by the central authorities, even as local authorities were objecting.\nOdessa massacre.\nThe Odessa massacre, an act of collective punishment carried out by the Romanian Army and Gendarmes, took the lives of a minimum of between 15,000 and 25,000 to as many as 40,000 or even more than 50,000 Jewish people of all ages. The measure came as the enforcement of Antonescu's own orders, as retaliation for an explosion that killed 67 people at Romanian headquarters on that city. Antonescu believed that the original explosion was a terrorist act, rejecting the possibility of the building in question having been fitted with land mines by the retreating Soviets. In addition, Antonescu blamed the Jews, specifically \"Jewish commissars\" in the Red Army, for the losses suffered by his 4th Army throughout the siege, although both an inquiry he had ordered and German assessments pointed to the ill-preparedness of Romanian soldiers. While the local command took the initiative for the first executions, Antonescu's personal intervention amplified the number of victims required, and included specific quotas (200 civilians for every dead officer, 100 for every dead soldier). By the time of the explosion, the Jewish population was already rounded up into makeshift ghettos, being made subject to violence and selective murders.\nPurportedly the largest single massacre of Jews in the war's history, it involved mass shootings, hangings, acts of immolation and a mass detonation. Antonescu is quoted saying that the Romanian Army's criminal acts were \"reprisals, not massacres\". Survivors were deported to the nearby settlement of Slobidka, and kept in inhumane conditions. Alexianu himself intervened with Antonescu for a solution to their problems, but the Romanian leader decided he wanted them out of the Odessa area, citing the nearby resistance of Soviet troops in the Siege of Sevastopol as a ferment for similar Jewish activities. His order to Alexianu specified: \"Pack them into the catacombs, throw them into the Black Sea, but get them out of Odessa. I don't want to know. A hundred can die, a thousand can die, all of them can die, but I don't want a single Romanian official or officer to die.\" Defining the presence of Jews in occupied Odessa as \"a crime\", Antonescu added: \"I don't want to stain my activity with such lack of foresight.\" As a result of this, around 35,000\u201340,000 Jewish people were deported out of Odessa area and into other sectors of Transnistria. Several thousands were purposefully driven into Berezivka and other areas inhabited by the Black Sea Germans, where \"Selbstschutz\" organizations massacred them.\nOverall death toll and particularities.\nA common assessment ranks Antonescu's Romania as second only to Nazi Germany in its antisemitic extermination policies. According to separate works by historians Dennis Deletant and Adrian Cioroianu, the flaws of Antonescu's 1946 trial notwithstanding, his responsibility for war crimes was such that he would have been equally likely to be found guilty and executed in a Western Allied jurisdiction. The often singular brutality of Romanian-organized massacres was a special topic of reflection for Jewish Holocaust escapee and American political theorist Hannah Arendt, as discussed in her 1963 work \"Eichmann in Jerusalem\". Official Romanian estimates made in 2003 by the Wiesel Commission mention that between 280,000 and 380,000 Jews were killed by Romanian authorities under Antonescu's rule. The Transnistria deportations account for 150,000 to 170,000 individual expulsions of Jews from Romania proper, of whom some 90,000\u2013120,000 never returned. According to Romanian-born Israeli historian Jean Ancel, the Transnistria deportations from other areas account for around 145,000 deaths, while the number of local Transnistrian Jews killed could be as high as 280,000. More conservative estimates for the latter number mention some 130,000\u2013180,000 victims. Other overall estimates speak of 200,000 to over 300,000 Jews purposefully killed as a result of Romania's action. According to historians Antony Polonsky and Joanna B. Michlic: \"none of these massacres was carried out by the Germans, although [the latter] certainly encouraged such actions and, in some cases, may have coordinated them.\" The Romani deportations affected some 25,000 people, at least 11,000 of whom died in Transnistria.\nThe Jewish population in the Old Kingdom, numbering between 300,000 and 400,000 people, survived the Holocaust almost intact. Reflecting on this fact, Lucian Boia noted that Antonescu could not \"decently\" be viewed as a rescuer of Jews, but that there still is a fundamental difference between the effects of his rule and those of Hitler's, concluding that the overall picture is not \"completely dark.\" For Dennis Deletant, this situation is a \"major paradox\" of Antonescu's time in power: \"more Jews survived under [Antonescu's] rule than in any other country within Axis Europe.\" American historian of Romania William O. Oldson views Antonescu's policies as characterized by \"violence, inconsistency and inanity\", but places them in the wider context of local antisemitism, noting some ideological exceptions from their respective European counterparts. These traits, he argues, became \"providential\" for the more assimilated Jewish communities of the Old Romanian Kingdom, while exposing Jews perceived as foreign. Discussing Antonescu's policy of ethnic cleansing, Polonksy and Mihlic note: \"[it] raises important questions about the thin line between the desire to expel an unwanted minority and a small-scale genocidal project under sanctioned conditions.\" American military historian Gerhard L. Weinberg made reference to the Antonescu regime's \"slaughter of large number of Jews in the areas ceded to the Soviet Union in 1940 when those areas were retaken in 1941 as well as in [...] Transnistria\", but commented: \"the government of Marshal Ion Antonescu preferred to rob and persecute Jews [from Romania]; the government would not turn them over to the Germans for killing.\"\nAlongside the noticeable change in fortunes on the Eastern Front, a main motivator for all post-1943 changes, noted by various historians, was the manifold financial opportunity of Jewish survival. Wealthier Jews were financially extorted in order to avoid community work and deportation, and the work of some professionals was harnessed by the public sector, and even by the Army. From the beginning, the regime had excepted from deportations some Jews who were experts in fields such as forestry and chemistry, and some others were even allowed to return despite antisemitic protests in their home provinces. Economic exploitation was institutionalized in late 1941-early 1942, with the creation of a Central Jewish Office. Supervised by Commissioner Radu Lecca and formally led by the Jewish intellectuals Nandor Gingold and Henric Streitman, it collected funds which were in part redirected toward Maria Antonescu's charities. Small numbers of Romanian Jews left independently for the Palestine as early as 1941, but British opposition to Zionist plans made their transfer perilous (one notorious example of this being the MV \"Struma\"). On a personal level, Antonescu's encouragement of crimes alternated with periods when he gave in to the pleas of Jewish community leader Wilhelm Filderman. In one such instance, he reversed his own 1942 decision to impose the wearing of yellow badges, which nevertheless remained in use everywhere outside the Old Kingdom and, in theory, to any Romanian Jews elsewhere in Axis-controlled Europe. Assessing these contradictions, commentators also mention the effect of Allied promises to prosecute those responsible for genocide throughout Europe. In the late stages of the war, Antonescu was attempting to shift all blame for crimes from his regime while accusing Jews of \"bring[ing] destruction upon themselves\".\nThe regime permitted non-deported Romanian Jews and American charities to send humanitarian aid into Transnistrian camps, a measure it took an interest in enforcing in late 1942. Deportations of Jews ceased altogether in October of the same year. A common explanation historians propose for this reassessment of policies is the change in Germany's fortunes on the Eastern Front, with mention that Antonescu was considering using the Jewish population as an asset in his dealings with the Western Allies. It nevertheless took the regime more than a year to allow more selective Jewish returns from Transnistria, including some 2,000 orphans. After Transnistria's 1944 evacuation, Antonescu himself advocated the creation of new camps in Bessarabia. In conversations with his cabinet, the \"Conduc\u0103tor\" angrily maintained that surviving Jews were better off than Romanian soldiers.\nThe policies applied in respect to the Romani population were ambivalent: while ordering the deportation of those he considered criminals, Ion Antonescu was taking some interest in improving the lives of Romani labourers of the B\u0103r\u0103gan Plain. According to Romanian historian Viorel Achim, although it had claimed the existence of a \"Gypsy problem\", the Antonescu regime \"did not count it among its priorities.\" By 1943, Antonescu was gradually allowing those deported to return home. Initially, Constantin Vasiliu allowed the families of soldiers to appeal their deportation on a selective basis. Romanian authorities also appear to have been influenced by the objections of Nazi administrators in the \"Reichskommissariat Ukraine\", who feared that the newly arrived population would outnumber local Germans. By January 1944, the central authorities ordered local ones not to send back apprehended fugitives, instructed them to provide these with some food and clothing, and suggested corporal punishment for Romani people who did not adhere to a behavioural code. As the Romanian administrators abandoned Transnistria, most survivors from the group returned on their own in summer 1944.\nAntonescu and the Final Solution projects.\nIon Antonescu and his subordinates were for long divided on the issue of the Final Solution, as applied in territories under direct Nazi control from 1941. At an early stage, German attempts to impose the RSHA's direct control over Old Kingdom Jews drew some objections from Mihai Antonescu, but the two sides agreed to a common policy with reference to Soviet Jews. In various of his early 1940s statements, Antonescu favourably mentions the Axis goal of eliminating the Jewish presence in the event of victory. The unrestrained character of some Romanian actions toward Jews alarmed Nazi officials, who demanded a methodical form of extermination. When confronted with German decisions to push back Jews he had expelled before the occupation of Transnistria, Antonescu protested, arguing that he had conformed with Hitler's decisions regarding \"eastern Jews\". In August 1941, in preparation for the Final Solution's universal application, Hitler remarked: \"As for the Jewish question, today in any case one could say that a man like Antonescu, for example, proceeds much more radically in this manner than we have done until now. But I will not rest or be idle until we too have gone all the way with the Jews.\"\nBy summer 1942, German representatives in Romania obtained Antonescu's approval to deport the remaining Jewish population to extermination camps in occupied Poland. Among those involved on the German side were mass murderer Adolf Eichmann and his aide Gustav Richter, while the Romanian side was represented by Jewish Affairs Commissioner Lecca (reporting to Antonescu himself). Richter directed Lecca in setting up the Central Jewish Office, which he assumed would function as a \"Judenrat\" to streamline extermination policies. According to such plans, only some 17,000 Jews, labeled useful to Romania's economy, were to be exempt. The transports had already been announced to the Romanian Railways by autumn 1942, but the government eventually decided to postpone these measures indefinitely as was done with most other deportations to Transnistria. Antonescu's new orders on the matter were brought up in his conversations with Hitler at Schloss Klessheim, where both leaders show themselves aware of the fate awaiting Jewish deportees to Poland. By then, German authorities charged with applying the Final Solution in Eastern Europe completely abandoned their plans with respect to Romania. In August 1942, Antonescu had worked out plans with the SS for deporting all of the Jews of the \"Regat\" or the \"Old Kingdom\" to the German-run death camps in Poland, but then cancelled the deportation. The principal reasons for his change of mind were signs of disapproval from court circles, a warning from the American government passed on by the Swiss ambassador that he would prosecuted for war crimes and crimes against humanity after the Allies had won if the deportation went ahead, and most importantly because Hitler would not undo the Second Vienna Award and return northern Transylvania to Romania. Antonescu saw the deportation of the Jews of the \"Regat\" as the \"pro quid quo\" for the return of Transylvania and unable to obtain satisfactory promises from the German Ambassador Baron Manfred von Killinger that Romania would be rewarded with the return of Transylvania in exchange for handing over its Jews, Antonescu cancelled the deportation until the Germans would make him a better offer.\nAccording to Oldson, by the final stage of the war Romania rejected \"all extreme measures against Jews who could not be proven to be communists.\" The planned transports to Palestine, the prospect of which irritated Nazi German observers, implied a hope that the Allies' focus would shift away from the regime's previous guilt and, at the same time, looked forward to payments to be made in exchange for each person saved. The contrary implications of Romanian nationalism, manifested as reluctance to obey German commands and discomfort with drastic change in general, are occasionally offered as further explanations of the phenomenon. While reflecting upon the issue of emigration to Palestine, Antonescu also yielded to pleas of Jewish community leaders, and allowed safe passage through Romania for various Northern Transylvanian Jews fleeing the Holocaust in Hungary. He was doing the same for certain Northern Transylvanian Romani communities who had escaped southwards. In that context, Nazi German ideologues began objecting to Antonescu's supposed leniency. Antonescu nevertheless alternated tolerance of illegal immigration with drastic measures. In early 1944, he issued an order to shoot illegal immigrants, which was probably never enforced by the Border Police (who occasionally turned in Jewish refugees to the German authorities). The Antonescu regime allowed the extermination of the Romanian Jewish diaspora in other parts of Europe, formally opposing their deportation in some cases where it appeared Germany was impinging upon Romania's sovereignty.\nOpposition and political persecution.\nPolitical mainstream.\nThe circumstances of wartime accounted for cautious and ambivalent approaches to Antonescu's rule from among the Romanian political mainstream, which grouped advocates of liberal democracy and anti-fascism. According to Gledhill and King: \"Romanian liberals had been critical of their government's warm relationship with Hitler, which had been developing throughout the 1930s, but the [1940] Soviet attack on Romanian territory left them with little chance but to support Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union.\" Other authors also cite the Greater Romanian agenda of the Antonescu executive as a reason behind the widespread acquiescence. The tendency was illustrated by Dinu Br\u0103tianu, who, in late January 1941, told his National Liberal colleagues that the new \"government of generals\" was \"the best solution possible to the current crisis\", urging the group to provide Antonescu with \"all the support we can give him.\" An early point of contention between Antonescu and the National Peasants' Party came in spring 1941, when Antonescu's support for the Balkans Campaign and Romania's claim to parts of Vojvodina were met with a letter of protest from Iuliu Maniu, which Antonescu dismissed. Maniu and Br\u0103tianu also issued several condemnations of Antonescu's decision to continue the war beyond the Dniester. One such letter, signed by both, claimed that, while earlier steps had been \"legitimized by the entire soul of the nation, the Romanian people will never consent to the continuation of the struggle beyond our national borders.\" Maniu specifically mentioned the possibility of Allied victory, accused Antonescu of diverting attention from the goal of Greater Romania (Northern Transylvania included), and stressed that Romania's ongoing participation in the Axis was \"troubling enough\".\nAntonescu is known to have publicly admonished opposition leaders for their disobedience, which he equated with obstruction, and to have monitored their activities through the Special Intelligence Service. However, some early communiqu\u00e9s he addressed to Br\u0103tianu also feature offers of resignation, which their recipient reluctantly rejected. The Germans objected to such ambiguities, and Hitler once advised Antonescu to have Maniu killed, an option which the \"Conduc\u0103tor\" rejected because of the PN\u021a leader's popularity with the peasants. While tolerating contacts between Maniu and the Allies, Antonescu arrested the clandestine British envoys to Romania, thus putting a stop to the 1943 \"Operation Autonomous\". In parallel, his relationship with Queen Mother Helen and Michael rapidly deteriorated after he began advising the royal family on how to conduct its affairs. Dissent from Antonescu's policies sometimes came from inside his own camp. Both the officer corps and the General Staff were divided on the issue of war beyond the Dniester, although it is possible that the majority agreed it would bring Northern Transylvania back to Romania. A prominent case was that of Iosif Iacobici, the Chief of the Romanian General Staff, whose objection to the massive transfer of Romanian troops to the Eastern Front resulted in his demotion and replacement with Ilie \u0218teflea (January 1942). \u0218teflea issued similar calls, and Antonescu's eventually agreed to preserve a home army just before the Battle of Stalingrad. Various other military men extended their protection to persecuted Jews. Overall, Antonescu met significant challenges in exercising control over the politicized sectors in the armed forces.\nAntonescu's racial discrimination laws and Romania's participation in the Holocaust earned significant objections from various individuals and groups in Romanian society. One noted opponent was Queen Mother Helen, who actively intervened to save Jews from being deported. The Mayor of Cern\u0103u\u021bi, Traian Popovici, publicly objected to the deportation of Jews, as did Gherman P\u00e2ntea, his counterpart in Odessa. The appeals of Queen Helen, King Michael, the Orthodox Metropolitan of Transylvania Nicolae B\u0103lan, Apostolic Nuncio Andrea Cassulo and Swiss Ambassador Ren\u00e9 de Weck are credited with having helped avert the full application of the Final Solution in Antonescu's Romania. Cassulo and B\u0103lan together pleaded for the fate of certain Jews, including all who had converted to Christianity, and the former publicly protested against deportations. While Romania and the United States were still at peace, American Minister Plenipotentiary Franklin Mott Gunther repeatedly attempted to make his superiors aware of Romanian actions against the Jews, and Turkish diplomats unsuccessfully sought American approval for transferring Romanian Jews to safe passage through Anatolia and into Palestine. Dinu Br\u0103tianu also condemned antisemitic measures, prompting Antonescu to accuse him of being an ally of \"the Yid in London\". Together with Maniu and Ion Mihalache, Br\u0103tianu signed statements condemning the isolation, persecution and expulsion of Jews, which prompted Antonescu to threaten to clamp down on them. However, both parties were occasionally ambiguous on racial issues, and themselves produced antisemitic messages. Br\u0103tianu is also known for publicly defending the cause of Romani people, opposing their deportation on grounds that it would \"turn back the clock on several centuries of history\", a stance which drew support from his civilian peers. In parallel, some regular Romanians such as nurse Viorica Agarici intervened to save Jewish lives, while, from inside the Jewish community, Chief Rabbi Alexandru \u0218afran and activist Mi\u0219u Benvenisti rallied with Wilhelm Filderman in public protests against Antonescu's decisions, being occasionally joined by A. L. Zissu. In 1943, Filderman himself was deported to Mohyliv-Podilskyi, but eventually allowed to return.\nPolitical underground.\nOrganized resistance movements in Antonescu's Romania were comparatively small-scale and marginal. In addition to a Zionist underground which aided Jews to pass through or flee the country, the regime was confronted with local political movements of contrasting shades. One of them comprised far left and left-wing elements, which Antonescu's rise to power had caught in an unusual position. The minor Romanian Communist Party, outlawed since the rule of Ferdinand I for its Cominternist national policies, had been rendered virtually inactive by the German-Soviet non-aggression pact. Once reanimated by Operation Barbarossa, the PCR was unable to create an actual armed resistance movement, although it was able to coordinate the policies of several other small leftist groups. Speaking shortly before the invasion of the Soviet Union, and adopting the \"Jewish Bolshevism\" position, Antonescu ordered authorities to compile lists comprising \"the names of all Jewish and communist agents\", who were to be kept under close surveillance. Among people arrested on suspicion of communism, Jews were sent to Transnistrian sites such as Vapniarka and R\u00eebni\u021ba, while others were interned in regular facilities such as those in Caransebe\u0219 and T\u00e2rgu Jiu. In all, some 2,000 Jewish Romanian deportees to the region had been accused of political crimes (the category also included those who had tried to escape forced labour). According to one estimate, people held on charges of being communists accounted for just under 2,000 people, of whom some 1,200 were jailed in Romania proper. Capital punishment was used against various partisan-like activists, while the vast majority of communist prisoners in R\u00eebni\u021ba were massacred in March 1944. At the other end of the political spectrum, after the Legionary Rebellion and the Iron Guard's decapitation, many Legionaries who opposed the regime, and whom Antonescu himself believed were \"communists in [Legionary] green shirts\", were killed or imprisoned. An Iron Guardist underground was nevertheless formed locally, and probably numbered in thousands. Some of Antonescu's political prisoners from both camps were given a chance to redeem themselves by joining units on the Eastern Front.\nAlthough repressed, divided and weak, the PCR capitalized on the Soviet victories, being integrated into the mainstream opposition. At the same time, a \"prison faction\" emerged around Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, opposing both the formal leadership and the so-called \"Muscovite\" communists who had taken refuge in the Soviet Union before the war. While maneuvering for control within the PCR during and after 1944, \"prison\" communists destroyed a third group, formed around the PCR's nominal leader \u0218tefan Fori\u0219 (whom they kidnapped and eventually killed). The PCR leadership was still suffering from a crisis of legitimacy after beginning talks with the larger parties. The Soviets and \"Muscovite\" communists campaigned among Romanian prisoners of war in order to have them switch sides in the war, and eventually managed to set up the Tudor Vladimirescu Division.\nCultural circles.\nMeasures enforced by the Antonescu regime had contradictory effects on the Romanian cultural scene. According to Romanian literary historians Leti\u021bia Guran and Alexandru \u0218tefan, \"the Antonescu regime [...] did not affect negatively cultural modernity. The Romanian cultural elite regarded Antonescu's policies for the most part with sympathy.\" Nevertheless, other researchers record the dissent of several cultural environments: the classic liberalism and cosmopolitanism of aging literary theorist Eugen Lovinescu, the \"Lovinescian\" Sibiu Literary Circle, and the rebellious counterculture of young avant-garde writers (Ion Caraion, Geo Dumitrescu, Dimitrie Stelaru, Constant Tonegaru). Prominent left-wing writers Tudor Arghezi, Victor Eftimiu and Zaharia Stancu were political prisoners during the Antonescu years. Author George C\u0103linescu also stood out against the official guidelines, and, in 1941, took a risk by publishing a synthesis of Romanian literature which emphasized Jewish contributions, while composer George Enescu pleaded with Antonescu personally for the fate of Romani musicians. Similar acts of solidarity were performed by various prominent intellectuals and artists. In August 1942, King Michael received a manifesto endorsed by intellectuals from various fields, deploring the murders in Transnistria, and calling for a realignment of policies. Another such document of April 1944 called for an immediate peace with the Soviet Union. On a more intimate level, a diary kept by philosopher and art critic Alice Voinescu expresses her indignation over the antisemitic measures and massacres.\nA special aspect of political repression and cultural hegemony was Antonescu's persecution of Evangelical or Restorationist Christian denominations, first outlawed under the National Legionary regime. Several thousand adherents of the Pentecostal Union and the Baptist Union were reportedly jailed in compliance with his orders. Persecution targeted groups of religiously motivated conscientious objectors. In addition to the Inochentist movement, these groups included the Pentecostal Union, the Seventh-day Adventist Conference and the Jehovah's Witnesses Association. Antonescu himself recounted having contemplated using the death penalty against \"sects\" who would not allow military service, and ultimately deciding in favour of deporting \"recalcitrant\" ones. On 9 September 1940, the Ministry of Culture and Art issued a list of confessions that were recognized and protected by the regime. The list included the Romanian Orthodox Church, the Greek Catholic Church, the Roman Catholic Church, the Armenian Orthodox Church, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, the Calvinist Church, the Lutheran Church, the Unitarian Church, and Islam. Any confession not listed was considered officially banned.\nLegacy.\nConsequences of the Antonescu trial.\nThe period following Antonescu's fall returned Romania to a democratic regime and the 1923 Constitution, as well as its participation in the war alongside the Allies. However, it also saw the early stages of a communist takeover\u2014which culminated with King Michael's forced abdication on 30 December 1947 and the subsequent establishment of Communist Romania. The Antonescu trial thus fit into a long series of similar procedures and political purges on charges of collaborationism, instrumented by the Romanian People's Tribunals and various other institutions. During the rigged general election of 1946 and for years after Antonescu's execution, the Romanian Communist Party and its allies began using the implications of his trial as an abusive means of compromising some of their political opponents. One such early example was Iuliu Maniu, by then one of the country's prominent anti-communists, who was accused of being a fascist and an Antonescu sympathizer, mainly for having shaken his hand during the trial. The enlistment of ethnic Germans into Nazi German units, as approved by Antonescu, was used as a pretext for a Soviet-led expulsion of Germans from Romania. On similar grounds, the Soviet occupation forces organized the capture of certain Romanian citizens, as well as the return of war refugees from Romania proper into Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina. Both the arrestees and the returnees were often deported deeper into the Soviet Union. As part of its deteriorating relationship with Romanian Roman Catholics, and urged on by the Soviets, the communist cabinet of Petru Groza also deemed Apostolic Nuncio Andrea Cassulo a collaborator of Antonescu and a \"persona non grata\", based on transcripts of the Cassulo-Antonescu conversations. It also used such allegations to pressure several Greek-Catholic clergymen into accepting union with the Romanian Orthodox Church.\nNevertheless, Romanian-born Holocaust historian Radu Ioanid notes, few Romanians involved in organizing the Holocaust were prosecuted, and, of those, none were executed after the Antonescu trial. He attributes this to nationalist resistance within the administrative and judicial apparatus, to communist fears of alienating a too large number of people, to the emigration of Zionist survivors, and to the open hostility of some communists toward liberal Jewish community leaders. Jews also faced conflict with the new authorities and with the majority population, as described by other researchers. There were, nonetheless, sporadic trials for Holocaust-related crimes, including one of Maria Antonescu. Arrested in September 1944 and held 1945\u20131946 in Soviet custody, she was re-arrested at home in 1950, tried and ultimately found guilty of economic crimes for her collaboration with the Central Jewish Office. Five years later, she was sent into internal exile, and died of heart problems in 1964. After 1950, a large number of convicted war criminals, even some sentenced to life imprisonment, were deemed fit for \"social cohabitation\" (that is, fit to live amongst the general population) and released, while some suspects were never prosecuted.\nIn communist historiography.\nAlthough the Marxist analytical works of the increasingly marginalized communist figure Lucre\u021biu P\u0103tr\u0103\u0219canu make isolated mentions of the Holocaust, the heavily politicized official discourse inspired by Soviet historiography interpreted Romania's wartime evolution exclusively based on the Marxist-Leninist idea of class conflict. In this context, the main effort to document and expose the Antonescu-era massacres came from Jewish Romanians. This began in 1945, when Jewish journalists Marius Mircu and Maier Rudrich contributed first-hand testimonies. In 1946\u20131948, the Jewish community leader Matatias Carp published \"Cartea neagr\u0103\" (\"The Black Book\"), a voluminous and detailed account of all stages of the Holocaust. After forming a secondary element in Antonescu's indictment, the deportation of Romani people was largely ignored in official discourse.\nThe communist regime overemphasized the part played by the PCR in King Michael's Coup, while commemorating its 23 August date as a national holiday. The Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej faction emerged as the winner of the interior PCR struggles and incorporated nationalist discourse. That faction claimed a decisive role in toppling Antonescu, even though a majority of its members had been jailed for most of the period. In accordance with Stalinist principles, censorship produced historical revisionism that excluded focus on such negative aspects of Romanian behaviour during the war as antisemitism and the Holocaust, and obscured Romania's participation on the Eastern Front. Beginning in the mid-1960s, when Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu took power and embarked on a national communist course, the celebration of 23 August as the inception of the communist regime was accompanied by a contradictory tendency, which implied a gradual rehabilitation of Antonescu and his regime. Historians who focused on this period believe that the revival of nationalist tenets and the relative distance taken from Soviet policies contributed to the rehabilitation process. After a period of liberalization, the increasingly authoritarian Ceau\u0219escu regime revived the established patterns of personalized rule, and even made informal use of the title \"Conduc\u0103tor\". Beginning in the early 1970s, when the new policies were consecrated by the \"July Theses\", Ceau\u0219escu tolerated a nationalist, antisemitic and Holocaust denialist intellectual faction, illustrated foremost by \"S\u0103pt\u0103m\u00eena\" and \"Luceaf\u0103rul\" magazines of Eugen Barbu and Corneliu Vadim Tudor, by poet Adrian P\u0103unescu and his \"Flac\u0103ra\" journal, and by novelist Ion L\u0103ncr\u0103njan. The regime also came to cultivate a relationship with exiled tycoon Iosif Constantin Dr\u0103gan, a former Iron Guard member who had come to endorse both Antonescu's rehabilitation and the national communist version of protochronism. In contrast, much of dissident culture and the Romanian diaspora embraced the image of Michael I as its counterpart to the increasingly official Antonescu myth. Lucian Boia described this as \"the spectacular confrontation between the two contradictory myths [transposing] into historical and mythological terms a fundamental fissure which divides the Romanian society of today.\"\nTopics relating to the Holocaust in Romania were distorted during the communist era. Ceau\u0219escu himself mentioned the number of survivors of the deportations (some 50,000 people) as a total number of victims, failed to mention the victims' ethnic background, and presented most of them as \"communists and antifascists.\" The regime also placed emphasis on the Holocaust in Northern Transylvania (where the Final Solution had been applied by the Germans and the local Arrow Cross Party). Vladimir Tism\u0103neanu has said Antonescu has a \"pseudo-sacred aura\" and many Romanians consider the attempts to diminish this to be an affront to their national dignity: \"In post-Communist societies, fantasies of persecution offer immense gratification to large strata of frustrated individuals\". These national views are based on propaganda advanced during the Ceau\u0219escu regime.\nEarlier accounts of the massacres, which had already been placed under restricted use, were completely removed from public libraries. While a special politicized literature dealt with the Holocaust in Hungary, the entire Ceau\u0219escu period produced only one work entirely dedicated to Romania's participation. Centred on the Ia\u0219i pogrom, it shifted the blame from Romanian authorities and advanced a drastically reduced death toll. In its preface, official historian Nicolae Minei claimed that Romania was not responsible for any deaths among Jews. Other official texts made more radical claims, openly denying that Antonescu's regime was antisemitic, and that all those killed were victims of Germany or of circumstance.\nDebates of the 1990s.\nRomanians' image of Antonescu shifted several times after the 1989 Revolution toppled communism. Polls carried out in the 1990s show the \"Conduc\u0103tor\" was well liked by portions of the general public. This tendency, Lucian Boia argues, was similar to a parallel trend favouring Wallachia's 15th century Prince Vlad III the Impaler, indicating a preference for \"authoritarian solutions\" and reflecting \"a pantheon that was largely set in place in the 'Ceau\u0219escu era' \". It was also popular at the time to see the 1944 Coup exclusively as the onset of communization in Romania, while certain sections of the public opinion revived the notion of \"Jewish Bolshevism\", accusing Jews of having brought communism to Romania. British historian Tony Judt connected such reflexes to growing anti-Russian sentiment and Holocaust denial in various countries of the former Eastern Bloc, and termed them collectively \"mis-memory of anti-communism\". Vladimir Tism\u0103neanu, a prominent Romanian-born political scientist, referred to Antonescu's \"pseudo-sacred\" image with the post-1989 public, and to the phenomenon as \"fantasies of persecution.\" The wartime dictator's image appealed to many politicians of the post-1989 period, and sporadic calls for his rehabilitation were issued at the highest levels of authority. Far right groups issued calls for his canonization by the Romanian Orthodox Church (together with a similar request to canonize Corneliu Zelea Codreanu). Certain neofascist groups claim to represent a legacy of \"Codrenism\" from which Sima was a deviationist, and these have also become Antonescu apologists.\nA particular case in this process was that of forces gathered around the Greater Romania Party, a group often characterized as merging xenophobic or neofascist messages and the legacy of Ceau\u0219escu's national communism. Founded by party leader and former \"S\u0103pt\u0103m\u00eena\" contributor Corneliu Vadim Tudor, \"Rom\u00e2nia Mare\" magazine is known to have equated Antonescu and Ceau\u0219escu, presenting them both as \"apostles of the Romanian people\". In his bid for the office of President during the 1996 election, Vadim Tudor vowed to be a new Antonescu. Boia remarks that this meeting of extremes offers an \"extraordinary paradox\". Dr\u0103gan also openly resumed his activities in Romania, often in collaboration with Vadim Tudor's group, founding three organizations tasked with campaigning for Antonescu's rehabilitation: the media outlet Europa Nova, the Ion Antonescu Foundation and the Ion Antonescu League. His colleague Radu Theodoru endorsed such projects while accusing Jews of being \"a long-term noxious factor\" and claiming that it was actually ethnic Romanians who were victims of a communist Holocaust. Ion Coja and Paul Goma notably produced radical claims relying on fabricated evidence and deflecting blame for the crimes onto the Jews themselves. Several journals edited by Ion Cristoiu repeatedly argued in favour of Antonescu's rehabilitation, also making xenophobic claims; similar views were sporadically present in national dailies of various hues, such as \"Ziua\", \"Rom\u00e2nia Liber\u0103\" and \"Adev\u0103rul\".\nVarious researchers argue that the overall tendency to exculpate Antonescu was endorsed by the ruling National Salvation Front (FSN) and its successor group, later known as Social Democratic Party, who complemented an emerging pro-authoritarian lobby while depicting their common opponent King Michael and his supporters as traitors. Similar attempts to deny the role of Antonescu in the Holocaust were also made by the main opposition parties, the Christian Democratic National Peasants' Party and the National Liberal Party, with Radu C\u00e2mpeanu, the latter party's president, publicly describing the wartime leader as a \"great Romanian\" who tried to defend the Jews. Sections of both governing and opposition groups contemplated the idea of rehabilitating the wartime leader, and, in May 1991, Parliament observed a moment of silence in his memory. The perceived governmental tolerance of Antonescu's rehabilitation raised international concern and protests. While the FSN-supported Romanian President Ion Iliescu publicly opposed attempts to rehabilitate Antonescu and acknowledged the \"crimes he committed against the Jews\", it was his successor, Emil Constantinescu, a representative of the Democratic Convention, who in 1997 became the first Romanian officeholder to recognize the collective responsibility of Romanian authorities. Nevertheless, during the same period, Attorney General Sorin Moisescu followed a since-deprecated special appeal procedure to overturn sentences passed against Antonescu and other 1946 defendants, which he eventually withdrew.\nTo a certain degree, such pro-Antonescu sentiments were also present in post-1989 historiography. Reflecting back on this phenomenon in 2004, Maria Bucur wrote: \"the perverse image of Antonescu is not the product of a propaganda campaign led by right-wing extremists, but a pervasive myth fed by historical debates and political contests, and which the public seems indifferent to or accepts unproblematically.\" After the Revolution, archival sources concerning Antonescu, including those in the National Archives of Romania, were made more available to researchers, but documents confiscated or compiled by Soviet officials, kept in Russia, remained largely inaccessible. Although confronted with more evidence from the newly opened archives, several historians, including some employed by official institutions, continued to deny the Holocaust in Romania, and attributed the death toll exclusively to German units. In parallel, some continued an exclusive focus on Northern Transylvanian massacres. Local authors who have actively promoted Antonescu's image as a hero and wrote apologetic accounts of his politics include historians Gheorghe Buzatu and Mihai Pelin, and researcher Alex Mihai Stoenescu. Larry L. Watts published a similarly controversial monograph in the United States. Although criticized for denying the uniqueness of the Holocaust and downplaying Antonescu's complicity, Dinu C. Giurescu was recognized as the first post-communist Romanian historian to openly acknowledge his country's participation, while his colleagues \u0218erban Papacostea and Andrei Pippidi were noted as early critics of attempts to exculpate Antonescu. The matter of crimes in Transnistria and elsewhere was first included within the Romanian curriculum with a 1999 state-approved alternative textbook edited by Sorin Mitu.\nWiesel Commission and aftermath.\nIn 2003, after a period in which his own equivocal stance on the matter had drawn controversy, Constantinescu's successor Ion Iliescu established the Wiesel Commission, an international group of expert historians whose mission was the study of the Holocaust in Romania, later succeeded by the Elie Wiesel National Institute. The \"Final Report\" compiled by the Commission brought the official recognition of Antonescu's participation in the Holocaust. After that moment, public displays of support for Antonescu became illegal. Antonescu's SMERSH interrogations were recovered from the Russian archives and published in 2006. Despite the renewed condemnation and exposure, Antonescu remained a popular figure: as a result of the 2006 \"Mari Rom\u00e2ni\" series of polls conducted by the national station TVR 1, viewers nominated Antonescu as the 6th greatest Romanian ever. The vote's knockout phase included televised profiles of the ten most popular figures, and saw historian Adrian Cioroianu using the portion dedicated to Antonescu to expose and condemn him, giving voters reasons not to see the dictator as a great Romanian. The approach resulted in notable controversy after \"Ziua\" newspaper criticized Cioroianu, who defended himself by stating he had an obligation to tell the truth.\nThe same year, on 5 December, the Bucharest Court of Appeal overturned Antonescu's conviction for certain crimes against peace, on the grounds that the objective conditions of 1940 justified a preventive war against the Soviet Union, which would make Article 3 of the 1933 Convention for the Definition of Aggression inapplicable in his case (as well as in those of Alexianu, Constantin Pantazi, Constantin Vasiliu, Sima, and various Iron Guard politicians). This act raised official protests in Moldova, the independent state formed in Bessarabia upon the breakup of the Soviet Union, and in Russia, the Soviet successor state, as well as criticism by historians of the Holocaust. The Court of Appeals decision was overturned by the Romanian Supreme Court in May 2008. The same year, Maria Antonescu's collateral inheritors advanced a claim on a Predeal villa belonging to the couple, but a Bra\u0219ov tribunal rejected their request, citing laws which confiscated the property of war criminals.\nCultural legacy, portrayals and landmarks.\nBeyond their propaganda and censorship efforts, Antonescu and his regime had a sizable impact on Romanian culture, art and literature. Owing to austere guidelines on culture and to the circumstances of wartime, this period's direct imprint is less than that of other periods in the country's history. Few large heroes' memorials were built during the war years. Memorials produced at the time were mainly roadside triptychs (\"troi\u021be\"). The Heroes' Cult organization received expropriation rights to Bucharest's Jewish cemetery in 1942, and proposed to replace it with a major monument of this category, but that plan was eventually abandoned. Antonescu and his wife preferred donating to Orthodox churches, and were \"ktitors\" of churches in three separate Bucharest areas: M\u0103rgeanului Church in Rahova, one in D\u0103m\u0103roaia, and the Saints Constantine and Helena Church in Muncii, where both the Marshal and his wife are depicted in a mural. After floods took a toll on his native Arge\u0219 County, the Marshal himself established \"Antone\u0219ti\", a model village in Corbeni (partly built by Ukrainian prisoners of war, and later passed into state property), while ordering hydroelectric exploitation of the Arge\u0219 River. He also had sporadic contacts with the artistic and literary environment, including an interview he awarded to his supporter, writer Ioan Alexandru Br\u0103tescu-Voine\u0219ti. His 1946 trial was notably attended and documented by George C\u0103linescu in a series of articles for \"Na\u021biunea\" journal. Political humour of the 1940s preserved distinct images of the Romanian leader. Romanian jokes circulated under Antonescu's rule ridiculed his adoption of the title \"Marshal of Romania\", viewing it as a self-promotion and dubbing him the \"Auto-Marshal\". During the war, Soviet agitprop portrayed Antonescu and the other secondary Axis leaders as villains and servile dog-like creatures, representations notably present in musical theater and puppetry shows, as well as in press cartoons.\nMarin Preda's 1975 novel \"Delirul\" displays the Ceau\u0219escu regime's ambiguous relationship with Antonescu. Critics John Neubauer and Marcel Cornis-Pope remark that the novel is \"admittedly not [Preda's] best work\", and discuss his \"complex representation\" of Antonescu as \"an essentially flawed but active leader who tried to negotiate some maneuvering room between the demands of Germany and the threats of the Soviet Union [and whose failure] led to the dismantling of Romania's fragile democratic system.\" The book sought Antonescu's rehabilitation for his attitudes on the Bessarabia-Northern Bukovina issue, but did not include any mention of his antisemitic policies, of which Preda himself may have been ignorant. An international scandal followed, once negative comments on the book were published by the Soviet magazine \"Literaturnaya Gazeta\". Although an outspoken nationalist, Eugen Barbu produced a satirical image of Antonescu in his own 1975 novel, \"Incognito\", which was described by Deletant as \"character assassination\".\nDuring the 1990s, monuments to Antonescu were raised and streets were named after him in Bucharest and several other cities. Among those directly involved in this process were Iosif Constantin Dr\u0103gan, the nationalist Mayor of Cluj-Napoca, Gheorghe Funar, and General Mircea Chelaru, whose resignation from the Army was subsequently requested and obtained. Also during that interval, in 1993, filmmaker and Social Democratic politician Sergiu Nicolaescu produced \"Oglinda\", which depicts Antonescu (played by Ion Siminie) apologetically. The rehabilitation trend was also represented at an October 1994 commemorative exhibit at the National Military Museum. The same year, a denialist documentary film, \"Destinul mare\u0219alului\" (\"The Marshal's Destiny\"), was distributed by state-owned companies, a matter which raised concern. After the Wiesel Commission presented its findings and such public endorsement was outlawed, statues in Antonescu's likeness were torn down or otherwise made unavailable for public viewing. An unusual case is that of his Saints Constantine and Helena Church, where, after lengthy debates, his bust was sealed inside a metal box. Outside of this context, the publicized display of Antonescu's portraits and racist slogans by football hooligans during Liga I's 2005\u20132006 season prompted UEFA intervention &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;. As of 2019, Romania has nine streets named after Antonescu; locations include Constan\u021ba, R\u00e2mnicu S\u0103rat, and Bechet.\nAwards and decorations.\nAntonescu received a number of awards and decorations throughout his military career, most notable being the Order of Michael the Brave, which was personally awarded to him by King Ferdinand I during the Hungarian\u2013Romanian War of 1919. He also received several decorations from foreign countries. He was the first Romanian to receive the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, being awarded it by Hitler himself.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences and further reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37262", "revid": "37005538", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37262", "title": "J\u00f8rn Utzon", "text": "Danish architect (1918\u20132008)\nJ\u00f8rn Oberg Utzon (; 9 April 1918\u00a0\u2013 29 November 2008) was a Danish architect. In 1957, he won an international design competition for his design of the Sydney Opera House in Australia. Utzon's revised design, which he completed in 1961, was the basis for the landmark, although it was not completed until 1973.\nWhen the Sydney Opera House was declared a World Heritage Site on 28 June 2007, Utzon became only the second person to have received such recognition for one of his works during his lifetime, after Oscar Niemeyer. Other noteworthy works include Bagsv\u00e6rd Church near Copenhagen and the National Assembly Building in Kuwait. He also made important contributions to housing design, especially with his Kingo Houses near Helsing\u00f8r.\nUtzon attended the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts (1937\u201342) and was influenced early on by Gunnar Asplund and Alvar Aalto.\nEarly life and career.\nUtzon was born in Copenhagen, the son of a naval architect, and grew up in Aalborg, Denmark, where he became interested in ships and a possible naval career. As a result of his family's interest in art, from 1937 he attended the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts where he studied under Kay Fisker and Steen Eiler Rasmussen. Following his graduation in 1942, he joined Gunnar Asplund in Stockholm where he worked together with Arne Jacobsen and Poul Henningsen. He took a particular interest in the works of American architect Frank Lloyd Wright.\nAfter the end of World War II and the German Occupation of Denmark, he returned to Copenhagen.\nIn 1946 he visited Alvar Aalto in Helsinki. In 1947\u201348 he travelled in Europe, in 1948 he went to Morocco where he was taken by the tall clay buildings. In 1949, he travelled to the United States and Mexico, where the pyramids provided further inspiration. Fascinated by the way the Mayans built towards the sky to get closer to God, he commented that his time in Mexico was \"One of the greatest architectural experiences in my life.\"\nIn America, he visited Frank Lloyd Wright's home, Taliesin West, in the Arizona desert and met Charles and Ray Eames. In 1950 he established his own studio in Copenhagen and, in 1952, built an open-plan house for himself, the first of its kind in Denmark. In 1957, he travelled first to China (where he was particularly interested in the Chinese desire for harmony), Japan (where he learnt much about the interaction between interiors and exteriors) and India, before arriving in Australia in 1957 where he stayed until 1966. All this contributed to Utzon's understanding of factors which contribute to successful architectural design.\nArchitectural approach.\nUtzon had a Nordic sense of concern for nature which, in his design, emphasized the synthesis of form, material and function for social values. His fascination with the architectural legacies of the ancient Mayas, the Islamic world, China, and Japan also informed his practice. This developed into what Utzon later referred to as Additive Architecture, comparing his approach to the growth patterns of nature.\nA design can grow like a tree, he explained: \"If it grows naturally, the architecture will look after itself.\"\nSydney Opera House.\nIn 1957, Utzon unexpectedly won the competition to design the Sydney Opera House. His submission was one of 233 designs from 32 countries, many of them from the most famous architects of the time. Although he had won six other architectural competitions previously, the Opera House was his first non-domestic project. One of the judges, Eero Saarinen, described it as \"genius\" and declared he could not endorse any other choice.\nThe designs Utzon submitted were little more than preliminary drawings. Emory Kemp's consulting career began at Ove Arup, where, he conducted analytical calculations for the roof, noting this was no simple task, as Utzon's sketches were designed to embellish the beauty of the international landmark, not necessarily for simple mathematics. Concerned that delays would lead to lack of public support, the Cahill Government of New South Wales nonetheless gave the go-ahead for work to begin in 1958. The British engineering consultancy Ove Arup &amp; Partners put out tenders without adequate working drawings and construction work began on 2 March 1959. As a result, the podium columns were not strong enough to support the roof and had to be rebuilt. The situation was complicated by Cahill's death in October 1959.\nThe extraordinary structure of the shells themselves represented a puzzle for the engineers. This was not resolved until 1961, when Utzon himself finally came up with the solution. He replaced the original elliptical shells with a design based on complex sections of a sphere. Utzon says his design was inspired by the simple act of peeling an orange: the 14 shells of the building, if combined, would form a perfect sphere.\nAlthough Utzon had spectacular, innovative plans for the interior of these halls, he was unable to realise this part of his design. In mid-1965, the New South Wales Liberal government of Robert Askin was elected. Askin had been a 'vocal critic of the project prior to gaining office.' His new Minister for Public Works, Davis Hughes, was even less sympathetic. Elizabeth Farrelly, Australian architecture critic has written that\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;at an election night dinner party in Mosman, Hughes' daughter Sue Burgoyne boasted that her father would soon sack Utzon. Hughes had no interest in art, architecture or aesthetics. A fraud, as well as a philistine, he had been exposed before Parliament and dumped as Country Party leader for 19 years of falsely claiming a university degree. The Opera House gave Hughes a second chance. For him, as for Utzon, it was all about control; about the triumph of homegrown mediocrity over foreign genius.\nUtzon soon found himself in conflict with the new Minister. Attempting to rein in the escalating cost of the project, Hughes began questioning Utzon's capability, his designs, schedules and cost estimates, refusing to pay running costs. In 1966, after a final request from Utzon that plywood manufacturer Ralph Symonds should be one of the suppliers for the roof structure was refused, he resigned from the job, closed his Sydney office and vowed never to return to Australia. When Utzon left, the shells were almost complete, and costs amounted to only $22.9\u00a0million. Following major changes to the original plans for the interiors, costs finally rose to $103\u00a0million.\nThe Opera House was finally completed in 1973 and Elizabeth II attended its opening. Utzon was invited to the opening ceremony by the Premier and while pleased by the invitation, he declined commenting \"I cannot be a guest of the Government of New South Wales and at the same time criticize one of its ministers\". He was, however, to be recognised later when he was asked to design updates to the interior of the opera house. The Utzon Room, overlooking Sydney Harbour, was officially dedicated in October 2004. In a statement at the time Utzon wrote: \"The fact that I'm mentioned in such a marvellous way, it gives me the greatest pleasure and satisfaction. I don't think you can give me more joy as the architect. It supersedes any medal of any kind that I could get and have got.\" Furthermore, Frank Gehry, one of the Pritzker Prize judges, commented: \"Utzon made a building well ahead of its time, far ahead of available technology, and he persevered through extraordinarily malicious publicity and negative criticism to build a building that changed the image of an entire country.\"\nWorks in Denmark.\nWhile some of Utzon's most notable works are spread around the globe, he was most prolific in his native Denmark, whose landscape inspired him more than any other. Bagsv\u00e6rd Church, just north of Copenhagen, is considered to be a masterpiece of contemporary church architecture, thanks to its bright, naturally illuminated interior and its concrete ceiling straddled with softly-rounded vaulting inspired by clouds. Designed in 1968, the church was completed in 1976. In the church there is a grand piano by Steingraeber designed by Utzon. The Kingo Houses in Helsing\u00f8r (1958) consist of 63 L-shaped homes based on the design of traditional Danish farmhouses with central courtyards. Built in rows following the undulations of the site, each of the houses not only has a view of its own but enjoys the best possible conditions for sunlight and shelter from the wind. Utzon described the arrangement as \"flowers on the branch of a cherry tree, each turning towards the sun.\" In general, Utzon's houses display sophisticated and varied relationships to the path of the sun.\nA few years later, he went on to design the Fredensborg Houses (1963) for Danish pensioners who had worked for long periods abroad. Utzon helped select the site, and planned a complex consisting of 47 courtyard homes and 30 terraced houses as well as a central building with a restaurant, meeting rooms and nine guest rooms. His design was inspired by housing in Beijing's Forbidden City. The homes are located around a square in groups of three, designed to maximize privacy, natural lighting, and views of the surrounding countryside. When he was awarded the Pritzker Prize in 2003, Utzon was specifically lauded for his working designing housing projects that, the jury said, were \"designed with people in mind.\"\nHis Paustian Furniture Store (1988) on Copenhagen's waterfront stands on a multitude of columns inspired by a beech forest. A temple-like finish is achieved by 11 columns with fan-shaped capitals overlooking the harbour. Similar columns are also present inside the spacious interior, stretching up to the skylight dominating the roof.\nIn 2005, in close collaboration with his son Kim Utzon, he helped to plan the Utzon Center in Aalborg (completed 2008) designed to inspire young students of architecture. Located on the waterfront, its high sculptured roofs rise over an auditorium, a boathall and a library while the lower roofs of its exhibition rooms and workshops surround a central courtyard, sheltered from the wind.\nOther works.\nKuwait's National Assembly Building, completed in 1982, stands on the sea front with (in Utzon's words) \"haze and white light and an untidy town behind.\" Benefiting from an understanding of Islamic architecture, Utzon designed a building consisting of a covered square, a parliamentary chamber, a conference hall, and a mosque. Its waving roof conveys the impression of moving fabric. Its columns are reminiscent of the Karnak temples.\nHe was also referenced in a Durham University tour video by YouTuber Jack Edwards as being the designer for the university's Student's Union building.\nThe Melli Bank building in Tehran, slightly set back from the lines of the busy street where it stands, has a reinforced concrete frame faced with natural stone. The ground-level banking hall, naturally illuminated by skylight vaults, is connected to the upper floor by a central spiral staircase, providing maximum flexibility of space.\nLater life.\nOn his return from Australia in 1966, Utzon made a stop on Mallorca. Fascinated by the island, he decided to build a summer house there on the top of a cliff near the fishing village of Portopetro. Named Can Lis after his wife, the house was based on the home he had intended to build in Australia but was inspired by local materials and climate, setting standards for contemporary Mediterranean architecture. The house consists of five loosely linked blocks with a colonnaded outdoor area, a living room and two bedrooms, each with its own courtyard. The use of locally sourced pink stone in rough pillars is designed to give the impression of a much older building, in keeping with the landscape.\nAlthough Utzon and his wife spent an increasing amount of time on Mallorca, they became disturbed by all the tourists who came to see their home. They decided to move to a more remote area in the mountains where they built a second house known as Can Feliz, consisting of three blocks for dining, living and sleeping, separated by courtyards. The upper part of the grand theatrical living space is furnished for working with heavy timber bookcases and a large table. A huge window provides magnificent views of the pine forests and the sea beyond.\nThe Utzon Center in Aalborg, designed together with his son Kim, was the architect's last assignment. In 2005 he commented, \"From the bottom of my heart, I hope that the Utzon Center will be a place where positive thoughts converge and where students from the School of Architecture gather when they want to get together to discuss their ideas. It is intended to be a power centre for the architects and people of the future.\"\nUtzon died in Copenhagen on 29 November 2008 of a heart attack in his sleep after a series of operations. He was 90 years old at the time of his death, and had never returned to Australia to see the completed opera house. On 2 December 2008 the Parliament of New South Wales passed a special motion of condolence to honour Utzon's life and work. He was survived by his wife, Lis, his sons Jan and Kim, his daughter Lin, and several grandchildren. His sons are trained architects and his daughter is a designer, muralist and artist who was at one time married to the Australian architect Alex Popov.\nAwards and recognition.\nUtzon was bestowed an Honorary Fellowship of the American Institute of Architects (Hon. FAIA) in 1970 for his distinguished achievements as a foreign architect. On 17 May 1985, he was made an Honorary Companion of the Order of Australia (AC). He was given the Keys to the City of Sydney in 1998. He was involved in redesigning the Opera House, and in particular, the Reception Hall, beginning in 1999. In 2003, he received in his absence an honorary Doctor of Science degree in architecture (Hon. DScArch) from the University of Sydney; his son accepted the award on his behalf. In 2003, he was awarded the Pritzker Prize, architecture's highest honor.\nIn March 2006, Queen Elizabeth\u00a0II opened the western colonnade addition to the building designed by Utzon who had not returned to Australia since 1966. His son, Jan, took his place at the opening ceremony instead, saying his father was \"too old by now to take the long flight to Australia. But he lives and breathes the Opera House, and as its creator he just has to close his eyes to see it.\"\nOn 28 June 2007, the Sydney Opera House was declared a World Heritage Site.\nIn 2007 the Australian Institute of Architects named their annual international award the J\u00f8rn Utzon Award for International Architecture.\nFollowing Utzon's death in 2008, on 25 March 2009, a state memorial and reconciliation concert was held in the Concert Hall at Sydney Opera House.\nInfluence.\nAccording to Kenneth Frampton, Utzon's architectural influence is manifest on three levels: the emphasis given to the roof element, the importance given to the grounding of the building, and the commitment to \"the cultural validity of organic growth\". Kim Dirkinck-Holmfeld, writing in \"Dansk Arkitektur: 1960\u20131995\", comments: Utzon did not obtain many commissions in his mother country but his importance was considerable in terms of direct imitation or inspiration. And he was the only Danish architect who made a significant contribution to the global development of Modernism.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its rulers belonged to the junior Swabian branch of the House of Hohenzollern. The Swabian Hohenzollerns were elevated to princes in 1623. The small sovereign state with the capital city of Sigmaringen was annexed to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1850 following the abdication of its sovereign in the wake of the revolutions of 1848, then became part of the newly created Province of Hohenzollern.\nHistory.\nThe junior Swabian branch is less well known to history than the senior Franconian line, the latter of which became Burgraves of Nuremberg and later ruled Brandenburg and Prussia, and the German Empire.\nThe County of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen was created in 1576, upon the partition of the County of Hohenzollern, a fief of the Holy Roman Empire. When the last count of Hohenzollern, Karl I (1512\u20131579) died, the territory was divided among his three sons:\nThe princes of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen ruled over a small principality in south-western Germany, with a seat at Sigmaringen Castle. Unlike the Hohenzollerns of Brandenburg-Prussia, the Hohenzollerns of Sigmaringen remained Roman Catholic, along with their cousins of Hohenzollern-Hechingen (the senior line of the Swabian branch of the House of Hohenzollern) and Hohenzollern-Haigerloch.\nThe principality became a sovereign state in 1815 after the abolition of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 and an independent realm following the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. Its ruler, Charles, was deposed in the revolutions of 1848. His son, Karl Anton, succeeded him, and turned to Prussia for aid. Prussian troops arrived in August 1849, and in a treaty signed in December Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen was annexed by Prussia, effective in March 1850. The annexation of their state did not, however, mean the end of the importance of the House of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen.\nThe last prince, Karl Anton, served as Minister President of Prussia from 1858 to 1861. Karl Anton's second son, Karl Eitel of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen became prince (1866\u20131881) and then King of Romania, under the name Carol (reigned 1881\u20131914). The house remained on the throne until the end of the Romanian monarchy in 1947. The last King of Romania, Michael, died on 5 December 2017.\nBecause the eldest Hechingen line of the Hohenzollerns became extinct in 1869 with the death of Constantine, Prince of Hohenzollern-Hechingen, the head of the Sigmaringen branch, Karl Anton, dropped his line's suffix and took the title of Prince (\"F\u00fcrst\") of (all) Hohenzollern.\nFrench opposition to the candidacy of Carol's elder brother Prince Leopold for the throne of Spain triggered the Franco-Prussian War (1870\u20131871), which led to the founding of the German Empire in January 1871.\nTerritories, titles and styles.\nSouthern Germany.\nJurisdiction.\nThe head of the Swabian branch of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen ruled over the following territories:\nFrom 1061 until 1806 five of these fiefs (not including Nuremberg) constituted an immediate territory of the Holy Roman Empire under the counts of Zollern, vassals of the Holy Roman Emperor.\nFrom 1806 until 1813 the Hohenzollern lands were a realm of the Confederation of the Rhine, a short-lived state set up by Napoleon I Bonaparte. From 1815 until 1849 the principality was a sovereign country and a member of the German Confederation. In 1849 it lost its independence, and was incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia as the Province of Hohenzollern.\nThe German Confederation was succeeded in 1866 by the North German Confederation, which itself was succeeded by the German Empire in 1871. In 1918, the Kingdom of Prussia became the Free State of Prussia, and the German Empire was replaced by the Weimar Republic. In 1933 the republic was replaced by the Third Reich. After the defeat of the Nazis the province of Hohenzollern was merged with other territories into the state of W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern. This state was part of the Allied Occupation Zones in Germany until 1952. In that year, the state of W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern was merged into Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, a state of the Federal Republic of Germany.\nKarl Friedrich, Prince of Hohenzollern, is the head of the princely Swabian line.\nTitles.\nThe head of the House of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen is the historical heir to the titles of:\nStyles.\nThe historical titulature of rulers of the House of Hohenzollern was, in the German original: .\nThe English translation is: \"His Serene Highness (HSH) \"[name]\" by the Grace of God, Prince of Hohenzollern, Burgrave of Nuremberg, Count of Sigmaringen, Veringen and Berg, Lord of Haigerloch and Wehrstein\".\nRomanian branch.\nThe modern state of Romania was formed by union of the principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia in 1859, under the prince domnitor Alexandru Ioan Cuza. He was replaced by Karl Eitel of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen in 1866, who ascended the throne as Carol I, Prince of Romania.\nDuring the Russo-Turkish War (1877\u201378), Romania, which was a functionally independent vassal of the Ottoman Empire, proclaimed its full independence. After the commander of the Russian armies had requested Romania's help, Carol accepted to enter the war with the condition of being appointed as commander of the armies that were besieging Plevna. After the end of the Romanian War of Independence in the 1878, at the Treaty of Berlin, Romania was subsequently recognized as an independent state by the Great Powers.\nIn return for reverting to the Russian Empire three southern Bessarabian districts that had been regained by Moldavia after the Crimean War in 1852, Dobruja was acquired.\nIn 1881, the principality was raised to a kingdom and Prince Carol became King Carol I. He reigned until his death in 1914, and was succeeded by his nephew, Ferdinand. Shortly after taking the throne, Ferdinand, a Roman Catholic like his predecessor, agreed to have his children reared in the Romanian Orthodox Church.\nIn 1918 Transylvania and Bessarabia were incorporated. In 1918\u201319, confirmed by the Treaty of Versailles of 1919 and the Treaty of Trianon of 1920, most of the Banat became part of Romania. Also, Bukovina was incorporated in 1918.\nFerdinand died in 1927. His eldest son, Crown Prince Carol, having renounced his rights, Carol's only son Michael ascended the throne. In 1930, however, Carol reclaimed the throne and was crowned Carol II. Carol was forced to abdicate in 1940, and Michael re-mounted the throne. His reign, and that of the dynasty, ended when he was forced to abdicate by a communist regime in 1947.\nOn 10 May 2011, following lawsuits brought in Germany against his family by his German relatives regarding attribution of the title \"Prince of Hohenzollern-Veringen\" to his son-in-law, Radu Duda, Michael severed dynastic ties with the princely house of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, changed the name of his family to \"of Romania\", and ceased the use of all princely titles borne by him and his family that derived from the German Hohenzollerns.\nTitles.\nThe head of the Romanian branch continued, since abolition of the monarchy, to use the hereditary title he bore while reigning:\nDuring the reign of Carol II of Romania his son, Michael, was styled or, in English translation, \"His Highness The Grand Voivode of Alba Julia\".\nStyles.\nThe Romanian original is: (or ; both forms are accepted by the Romanian Academy)\nThe English translation is: \"His Majesty (H.M.)

Ferdinand was the second son of Leopold, Prince of Hohenzollern, and Infanta Ant\u00f3nia of Portugal, (daughter of Queen Maria II of Portugal and of Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-Kohary). His family was part of the Catholic branch of the Prussian royal family Hohenzollern.\nIn 1886, Ferdinand became heir presumptive to the Romanian throne, following the renunciation of his father (in 1880) and older brother. From the moment he settled in Romania, he continued his military career, gaining a series of honorary commands and being promoted to the rank of corps general. He married in 1893 Princess Marie of Edinburgh, granddaughter of both Queen Victoria and Emperor Alexander II.\nFerdinand became King of Romania on 10 October 1914, under the name Ferdinand I, following the death of his uncle, King Carol I. He ruled Romania during World War I, choosing to side with the Triple Entente against the Central Powers. This led to Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany removing his name from the royal house of Hohenzollern. At the war's end, Romania emerged as a much-enlarged kingdom due to Bessarabia, Bukovina and Transylvania and parts of Banat, Cri\u0219ana, and Maramure\u0219 becoming part of the Kingdom of Romania in 1920, and Ferdinand was crowned king of \"Greater Romania\" in a grand ceremony in 1922. In the years following the establishment of Greater Romania, Romanian society went through a series of major transformations, especially to the application of the agrarian reform and of the universal vote. In 1925, his eldest son, Prince Carol, gave up the rights of succession to the royal crown of Romania leading to a dynastic crisis, as the next prince in line of succession was Carol's 4-year-old son, Prince Michael. This led Ferdinand to remove Prince Carol's name from the royal house of Romania.\nFerdinand died from cancer in 1927 and was succeeded by his grandson Michael under a regency formed by three people: Prince Nicholas of Romania, the younger brother of Prince Carol; patriarch Miron Cristea; and president of the Supreme Court of Justice Gheorghe Buzdugan.\nEarly life.\nPrince Ferdinand Viktor Albert Meinrad of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen was born in Sigmaringen in southwestern Germany. The name was later shortened simply to Hohenzollern after the extinction of the Hohenzollern-Hechingen branch in 1869. The princes of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen had ruled the principality until 1850, when it was annexed to Prussia.\nFerdinand I was the son of Leopold, Prince of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, and Infanta Ant\u00f3nia of Portugal (1845\u20131913), daughter of Queen Maria II of Portugal and Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, heir to the Hungarian magnates of Koh\u00e1ry on his mother's side.\nFollowing the renunciations, first of his father in 1880 and then of his elder brother Prince Wilhelm of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen in 1886, young Ferdinand became the heir-presumptive to the throne of his childless uncle, King Carol I of Romania, who reigned until his death in October 1914. In 1889, the Romanian parliament recognized Ferdinand as a prince of Romania. The Romanian government did not require his conversion to Eastern Orthodoxy from Catholicism, as was the common practice prior to this date, thus allowing him to continue with his born creed, but it was required that his children be raised Orthodox, the state religion of Romania. For agreeing to this, Ferdinand was excommunicated from the Catholic Church, although this was later lifted.\nFerdinand's mother's first cousin Tsar Ferdinand I of Bulgaria sat on the throne of the neighbouring Bulgaria beginning in 1887, and was to become the greatest opponent of the kingdom of his Romanian cousins. The neighboring Emperor Francis Joseph, monarch of Austria-Hungary and as such, ruler of Transylvania, was Ferdinand's grandmother's first cousin.\nFerdinand, a complete stranger in his new home, started to get close to one of Queen Elisabeth's ladies in waiting, Elena V\u0103c\u0103rescu. Elisabeth, the Queen consort of Romania, very close to Elena herself, encouraged the romance, although she was perfectly aware of the fact that a marriage between the two was forbidden by the Romanian constitution (according to the 1866 Constitution of Romania, the heir-presumptive to the throne was not allowed to marry a Romanian).\nThe affair caused a sort of dynastic crisis in 1891. The result of this was the exile of both Elisabeth (in Neuwied) and Elena (in Paris), as well as a trip by Ferdinand through Europe in search of a suitable bride, whom he eventually found in Queen Victoria's granddaughter, Princess Marie of Edinburgh.\nMarriage.\nIn Sigmaringen on 10 January 1893, the Catholic Prince Ferdinand of Romania married his distant cousin, the Lutheran Princess Marie of Edinburgh, daughter of the Anglican Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, and the Orthodox Grand Duchess Marie Alexandrovna of Russia. Marie and Ferdinand were third cousins in descent from Franz Frederick Anton, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. Marie's paternal grandparents were Victoria of the United Kingdom and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha; her maternal grandparents were Alexander II of Russia and Marie of Hesse and by Rhine. The reigning emperor of neighbouring Russia at the time of the marriage was Marie's uncle, Tsar Alexander III, who would be succeeded by his eldest son and Marie's first cousin, Tsar Nicholas II, the following year.\nThe royal Romanian marriage produced three sons (Carol, Nicholas, and Mircea \u2013 the last of whom dying in infancy) and three daughters (Elisabeta, Maria \u2013 called \"Mignon\" \u2013 and Ileana), but it was unhappy. Indeed, the couple's two youngest children, Ileana and Mircea, are widely believed to have been sired by Marie's long-time lover, Barbu \u0218tirbey.\nKing of Romania.\nOn 10 October 1914, Ferdinand's uncle, Carol I, died without surviving issue. Ferdinand succeeded him as King of Romania, reigning until his own death on 20 July 1927.\nWorld War I.\nThough a member of a cadet branch of Germany's ruling Hohenzollern imperial family, Ferdinand presided over his country's entry into World War I on the side of the Triple Entente against the Central Powers, on 27 August 1916. Thus he gained the sobriquet \"the Loyal\", having kept the oath he swore before the Parliament of Romania in 1914: \"I will reign as a good Romanian.\"\nAs a consequence of this \"betrayal\" of his German origin, German Emperor Wilhelm II had Ferdinand's name erased from the Hohenzollern House register.\nDespite the setbacks after the entry into war, when Dobruja and Wallachia were occupied by the Central Powers, Romania fought in 1917 and stopped the German advance into Moldavia. When the new Bolshevik government of Russia sued for peace in 1918, Romania was surrounded by the Central Powers and forced to conclude a peace treaty of its own; however, Ferdinand refused to sign and ratify the Treaty of Bucharest. Allied forces then advanced on the Thessaloniki front and they knocked Bulgaria out of the war. Ferdinand ordered the re-mobilization of the Romanian Army, and Romania re-entered the war on the side of the Triple Entente.\nAfter the war.\nThe outcome of Romania's war effort was the union of Bessarabia, Bukovina, and Transylvania with the Kingdom of Romania in 1918. Ferdinand became the ruler of a greatly enlarged Romanian state in 1918\u20131920 following the victory of the Entente over the Central Powers, a war between the Kingdom of Romania and the new Hungarian Soviet Republic, and the Russian Civil War. He was crowned king of \"Greater Romania\" in a spectacular ceremony on 15 October 1922 in the courtyard of the newly consecrated \"Coronation Cathedral\" in the historic princely seat of Alba Iulia in Transylvania.\nA new period of Romanian history began on the day of the Union of Transylvania with Romania (Great Union Day, \"Marea Unire\"). This period would come to an end with international treaties, in the years leading to World War II, which ceded parts of Romania to its neighbors. As such, they are widely seen as an attempt to provoke the country into taking sides and joining the war.\nDomestic political life during his reign was dominated by the conservative National Liberal Party, which was led by the brothers Ion and Vintil\u0103 Br\u0103tianu. The acquisition of Transylvania had the unintended effect of enlarging the electoral base of the opposition, whose principal parties united in January 1925 \u2013 October 1926 to form the National Peasant Party.\nDeath.\nFerdinand died from colon cancer in Sinaia on July 20, 1927 at the age of 61. He was succeeded by his grandson Michael under a regency (King Michael's father having renounced his rights to the throne in December 1925). The regency had three members, one of whom was Ferdinand's second son, Prince Nicholas.\nMoldovan sculptor Veaceslav Jiglitchi installed stools (busts) of the king in different cities of Moldova (B\u0103l\u021bi, Cur\u0103tura, Rezina, Verejeni, Orhei, Nisporeni, Varni\u021ba) in 2015-23.\nArms and honours.\nHe received the following honours:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

The index was once used to categorize human beings in the first half of the 20th century, but today it is used to categorize dogs and cats.\nHistoric use in anthropology.\nEarly anthropology.\nThe cephalic index was used by anthropologists in the early 20th century as a tool to categorize human populations. It was used to describe an individual's appearance and for estimating the age of fetuses for legal and obstetrical reasons.\nThe cephalic index was defined by Swedish professor of anatomy Anders Retzius (1796\u20131860) and first used in physical anthropology to classify ancient human remains found in Europe. The theory became closely associated with the development of racial anthropology in the 19th and early 20th centuries, when historians attempted to use ancient remains to model population movements in terms of racial categories. American anthropologist Carleton S. Coon also used the index in the 1960s, by which time it had been largely discredited.\nIn the cephalic index model, human beings were characterized by having either a dolichocephalic (long-headed), mesaticephalic (moderate-headed), or brachycephalic (short-headed) cephalic index or cranial index.\nIndices.\nCephalic indices are grouped as in the following table:\nTechnically, the measured factors are defined as the maximum width of the bones that surround the head above the supramastoid crest (behind the cheekbones), and the maximum length from the most easily noticed part of the glabella (between the eyebrows) to the most easily noticed point on the back part of the head.\nControversy.\nThe usefulness of the cephalic index was questioned by the Italian anthropologist Giuseppe Sergi, who argued that cranial morphology provided a better means to model racial ancestry. Also, Franz Boas studied the children of immigrants to the United States in 1910 to 1912, noting that the children's cephalic index differed significantly from their parents', implying that local environmental conditions had a significant effect on the development of head shape.\nBoas argued that if craniofacial features were so malleable in a single generation, then the cephalic index was of little use for defining race and mapping ancestral populations. Scholars such as Earnest Hooton continued to argue that both environment and heredity were involved. Boas did not himself claim it was totally plastic.\nIn 2002, a paper by Sparks and Jantz re-evaluated some of Boas's original data using new statistical techniques and concluded that there was a \"relatively high genetic component\" of head shape. Ralph Holloway of Columbia University argues that the new research raises questions about whether the variations in skull shape have \"adaptive meaning and whether, in fact, normalizing selection might be at work on the trait, where both extremes, hyperdolichocephaly and hyperbrachycephaly, are at a slight selective disadvantage.\"\nIn 2003, anthropologists Clarence C. Gravlee, H. Russell Bernard, and William R. Leonard reanalyzed Boas's data and concluded that most of Boas's original findings were correct. Moreover, they applied new statistical, computer-assisted methods to Boas's data and discovered more evidence for cranial plasticity. In a later publication, Gravlee, Bernard and Leonard reviewed Sparks's and Jantz's analysis. They argue that Sparks and Jantz misrepresented Boas's claims, and that Sparks's and Jantz's data support Boas. For example, they point out that Sparks and Jantz look at changes in cranial size in relation to how long an individual has been in the United States in order to test the influence of the environment. Boas, however, looked at changes in cranial size in relation to how long the mother had been in the United States. They argue that Boas's method is more useful, because the prenatal environment is a crucial developmental factor.\nJantz and Sparks responded to Gravlee et al., reiterating that Boas' findings lacked biological meaning, and that the interpretation of Boas' results common in the literature was biologically inaccurate. In a later study, the same authors concluded that the effects Boas observed were likely the result of population-specific environmental effects such as changes in cultural practices for cradling infants, rather than the effects of a general \"American environment\" which caused populations in America to converge to a common cranial type, as Boas had suggested.\nVertical cephalic index.\nThe vertical cephalic index, also known as the length-height index, was a less-commonly measured head ratio. In the vertical cephalic index model, humans beings were characterized by having either a chamaecranic (low-skulled), orthocranic (medium high-skulled), or hypsicranic (high-skulled) cephalic index or cranial index.\nMedicine.\nThe cephalic index is also used in medicine, especially in the planning and effectiveness analysis of cranial deformity corrections. The index is a useful tool in assessing the morphology of cranial deformities in clinical settings. The index is used while looking at the fetal head shape, and can change in certain situations (ex. breech presentation, ruptured membranes, twin pregnancy). It can be measured for prenatal infants in the womb using obstetric ultrasound, and a value of 78.3% \u00b1 8% (\u00b12 standard deviations) is considered normal.\nModern use in animal breeding.\nThe cephalic index is used in the categorisation of animals, especially breeds of dogs and cats. \nBrachycephalic animals.\nA brachycephalic skull is relatively broad and short (typically with the breadth at least 80% of the length). Dog breeds such as the pug are sometimes classified as \"extreme brachycephalic\". Because of health issues brachycephaly is regarded in some countries as \"qualzucht\", which literally translates to \"torture breeding\" as it often leads to brachycephalic airway obstructive syndrome. \nList of brachycephalic dogs.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nList of brachycephalic cats.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMesaticephalic animals.\nA mesaticephalic skull is of intermediate length and width. Mesaticephalic skulls are not markedly brachycephalic or dolichocephalic. When dealing with animals, especially dogs, the more appropriate and commonly used term is not \"mesocephalic\", but rather \"mesaticephalic\", which is a ratio of head to nasal cavity.

It runs eight city blocks between Broadway in the west and South Street and the East River in the east with a length of just under 2,000 feet. The term \"Wall Street\" has become a metonym for the financial markets of the United States as a whole, the American financial services industry, New York\u2013based financial interests, or the Financial District. Anchored by Wall Street, New York has been described as the world's principal fintech and financial center.\nThe street was originally known in Dutch as \"Het Cingel\" (\"the Belt\") when it was part of New Amsterdam during the 17th century. An actual city wall existed on the street from 1653 to 1699. During the 18th century, the location served as a slave market and securities trading site, and from 1703 onward, the location of New York's city hall, which became Federal Hall. In the early 19th century, both residences and businesses occupied the area, but increasingly the latter predominated, and New York's financial industry became centered on Wall Street. During the 20th century, several early skyscrapers were built on Wall Street, including 40 Wall Street, once the world's tallest building. The street is near multiple subway stations and ferry terminals.\nThe Wall Street area is home to the New York Stock Exchange, the world's largest stock exchange by total market capitalization, as well as the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and commercial banks and insurance companies. Several other stock and commodity exchanges have also been located in Lower Manhattan near Wall Street, including the New York Mercantile Exchange and other commodity futures exchanges, along with the NYSE American. Many brokerage firms owned offices nearby to support the business they did on the exchanges. The economic impacts of Wall Street activities extend worldwide.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nIn the original records of New Amsterdam, the Dutch always called the street \"Het Cingel\" (\"the Belt\"), which was also the name of the original outer barrier street, wall, and canal of Amsterdam. After the English conquest of New Netherland in 1664, they renamed the settlement \"New York\" and in tax records from April 1665 (still in Dutch) they refer to the street as \"Het Cingel ofte Stadt Wall\" (\"the Belt or the City Wall\"). This use of both names for the street also appears as late as 1691 on the Miller Plan of New York. New York Governor Thomas Dongan may have issued the first official designation of Wall Street in 1686, the same year he issued a new charter for New York. Confusion over the origins of the name Wall Street appeared in modern times because in the 19th and early 20th century some historians mistakenly thought the Dutch had called it \"de Waal Straat\", which to Dutch ears sounds like Walloon Street. However, in 17th century New Amsterdam, de Waal Straat (Wharf or Dock Street) was a section of what is today's Pearl Street.\nThe original wall was constructed under orders from Director General of the Dutch West India Company Peter Stuyvesant at the start of the first Anglo-Dutch war soon after New Amsterdam was incorporated in 1653. Fearing an over land invasion of English troops from the colonies in New England (at the time Manhattan was easily accessible by land because the Harlem Ship Canal had not been dug), he ordered a ditch and wooden palisade to be constructed on the northern boundary of the New Amsterdam settlement. The wall was built of dirt and wooden planks, measuring long and tall and was built using the labor of both enslaved Africans and white colonists. In fact Stuyvesant had ordered that \"the citizens, without exception, shall work on the constructions\u2026 by immediately digging a ditch from the East River to the North River, 4 to 5 feet deep and 11 to 12 feet wide...\" And that \"the soldiers and other servants of the Company, together with the free Negroes, no one excepted, shall complete the work on the fort by constructing a breastwork, and the farmers are to be summoned to haul the sod.\"\nThe first Anglo-Dutch War ended in 1654 without hostilities in New Amsterdam, but over time the \"werken\" (meaning the works or city fortifications) were reinforced and expanded to protect against potential incursions from Native Americans, pirates, and the English. The English also expanded and improved the wall after their 1664 takeover (a cause of the Second Anglo-Dutch War), as did the Dutch from 1673 to 1674 when they briefly retook the city during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, and by the late 1600s the wall encircled most of the city and had two large stone bastions on the northern side. The Dutch named these bastions \"Hollandia\" and \"Zeelandia\" after the ships that carried their invasion force. The wall started at Hanover Square on Pearl Street, which was the shoreline at that time, crossed the Indian path that the Dutch called \"Heeren Wegh\", now called Broadway, and ended at the other shoreline (today's Trinity Place), where it took a turn south and ran along the shore until it ended at the old fort. There was a gate at Broadway (the \"Land Gate\") and another at Pearl Street, the \"Water Gate\". The wall and its fortifications were eventually removed in 1699\u2014it had outlived its usefulness because the city had grown well beyond the wall. A new City Hall was built at Wall and Nassau in 1700 using the stones from the bastions as materials for the foundation.\nSlavery had been introduced to Manhattan in 1626, but it was not until December 13, 1711, that the New York City Common Council made a market at the foot of Wall Street the city's first official slave market for the sale and rental of enslaved Africans and Indians. The market operated from 1711 to 1762 at the corner of Wall and Pearl Streets, and consisted of a wooden structure with a roof and open sides, although walls may have been added over the years; it could hold approximately 50 people. New York's municipal authorities directly benefited from the sale of slaves by implementing taxes on every person who was bought and sold there.\nIn these early days, local merchants and traders would gather at disparate spots to buy and sell shares and bonds, and over time divided themselves into two classes\u2014auctioneers and dealers. In the late 18th century, there was a buttonwood tree at the foot of Wall Street under which traders and speculators would gather to trade securities. The benefit was being in proximity to each other. In 1792, traders formalized their association with the Buttonwood Agreement which was the origin of the New York Stock Exchange. The idea of the agreement was to make the market more \"structured\" and \"without the manipulative auctions\", with a commission structure. Persons signing the agreement agreed to charge each other a standard commission rate; persons not signing could still participate but would be charged a higher commission for dealing.\nIn 1789, Wall Street was the scene of the United States' first presidential inauguration when George Washington took the oath of office on the balcony of Federal Hall on April 30, 1789. This was also the location of the passing of the Bill of Rights. Alexander Hamilton, who was the first Treasury secretary and \"architect of the early United States financial system\", is buried in the cemetery of Trinity Church, as is Robert Fulton, famed for his steamboats.\n19th century.\nIn the first few decades, both residences and businesses occupied the area, but increasingly, business predominated. \"There are old stories of people's houses being surrounded by the clamor of business and trade and the owners complaining that they can't get anything done,\" according to a historian named Burrows. The opening of the Erie Canal in the early 19th century meant a huge boom in business for New York City, since it was the only major eastern seaport which had direct access by inland waterways to ports on the Great Lakes. Wall Street became the \"money capital of America\".\nHistorian Charles R. Geisst suggested that there has constantly been a \"tug-of-war\" between business interests on Wall Street and authorities in Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States by then. Generally during the 19th century Wall Street developed its own \"unique personality and institutions\" with little outside interference.\nIn the 1840s and 1850s, most residents moved further uptown to Midtown Manhattan because of the increased business use at the lower tip of the island. The Civil War greatly expanded the northern economy, bringing greater prosperity to cities like New York which \"came into its own as the nation's banking center\" connecting \"Old World capital and New World ambition\", according to one account. J. P. Morgan created giant trusts and John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil moved to New York City. Between 1860 and 1920, the economy changed from \"agricultural to industrial to financial\" and New York maintained its leadership position despite these changes, according to historian Thomas Kessner. New York was second only to London as the world's financial capital.\nIn 1884, Charles Dow began tracking stocks, initially beginning with 11 stocks, mostly railroads. He looked at average prices for these eleven. Some of the companies included in Dow's original calculations were American Tobacco Company, General Electric, Laclede Gas Company, National Lead Company, Tennessee Coal &amp; Iron, and United States Leather Company. When the average \"peaks and troughs\" went up consistently, he deemed it a bull market condition; if averages dropped, it was a bear market. He added up prices, and divided by the number of stocks to get his Dow Jones average. Dow's numbers were a \"convenient benchmark\" for analyzing the market and became an accepted way to look at the entire stock market. In 1889 the original stock report, \"Customers' Afternoon Letter\", became \"The Wall Street Journal\". Named in reference to the actual street, it became an influential international daily business newspaper published in New York City. After October 7, 1896, it began publishing Dow's expanded list of stocks. A century later, there were 30 stocks in the average.\n20th century.\nEarly part.\nBusiness writer John Brooks in his book \"Once in Golconda\" considered the start of the 20th century period to have been Wall Street's heyday. The address of 23 Wall Street, the headquarters of J. P. Morgan &amp; Company, known as \"The Corner\", was \"the precise center, geographical as well as metaphorical, of financial America and even of the financial world\".\nWall Street has had changing relationships with government authorities. In 1913, for example, when authorities proposed a $4 stock transfer tax, stock clerks protested. At other times, city and state officials have taken steps through tax incentives to encourage financial firms to continue to do business in the city. A post office was built at 60 Wall Street in 1905. During the World War I years, occasionally there were fund-raising efforts for projects such as the National Guard.\nOn September 16, 1920, close to the corner of Wall and Broad Street, the busiest corner of the Financial District and across the offices of the Morgan Bank, a powerful bomb exploded. It killed 38 and seriously injured 143 people. The perpetrators were never identified or apprehended. The explosion did, however, help fuel the Red Scare that was underway at the time. A report from \"The New York Times\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The tomb-like silence that settles over Wall Street and lower Broadway with the coming of night and the suspension of business was entirely changed last night as hundreds of men worked under the glare of searchlights to repair the damage to skyscrapers that were lighted up from top to bottom. ... The Assay Office, nearest the point of explosion, naturally suffered the most. The front was pierced in fifty places where the cast iron slugs, which were of the material used for window weights, were thrown against it. Each slug penetrated the stone an inch or two [] and chipped off pieces ranging from three inches to a foot [] in diameter. The ornamental iron grill work protecting each window was broken or shattered. ... the Assay Office was a wreck. ... It was as though some gigantic force had overturned the building and then placed it upright again, leaving the framework uninjured but scrambling everything inside.\u2014\u200a\nThe area was subjected to numerous threats; one bomb threat in 1921 led to detectives sealing off the area to \"prevent a repetition of the Wall Street bomb explosion\".\nRegulation.\nSeptember 1929 was the peak of the stock market. October 3, 1929, was when the market started to slip, and it continued throughout the week of October 14.\nIn October 1929, renowned Yale economist Irving Fisher reassured worried investors that their \"money was safe\" on Wall Street. A few days later, on October 24, stock values plummeted. The stock market crash of 1929 ushered in the Great Depression, in which a quarter of working people were unemployed, with soup kitchens, mass foreclosures of farms, and falling prices. During this era, development of the Financial District stagnated, and Wall Street \"paid a heavy price\" and \"became something of a backwater in American life\".\nDuring the New Deal years, as well as the 1940s, there was much less focus on Wall Street and finance. The government clamped down on the practice of buying equities based only on credit, but these policies began to ease. From 1946 to 1947, stocks could not be purchased \"on margin\", meaning that an investor had to pay 100% of a stock's cost without taking on any loans. However, this margin requirement was reduced four times before 1960, each time stimulating a mini-rally and boosting volume, and when the Federal Reserve reduced the margin requirements from 90% to 70%. These changes made it somewhat easier for investors to buy stocks on credit. The growing national economy and prosperity led to a recovery during the 1960s, with some down years during the early 1970s in the aftermath of the Vietnam War. Trading volumes climbed; in 1967, according to \"Time Magazine\", volume hit 7.5\u00a0million shares a day which caused a \"traffic jam\" of paper with \"batteries of clerks\" working overtime to \"clear transactions and update customer accounts\".\nIn 1973, the financial community posted a collective loss of $245 million, which spurred temporary help from the government. Reforms were instituted; the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission eliminated fixed commissions, which forced \"brokers to compete freely with one another for investors' business\". In 1975, the SEC threw out the NYSE's \"Rule 394\" which had required that \"most stock transactions take place on the Big Board's floor\", in effect freeing up trading for electronic methods. In 1976, banks were allowed to buy and sell stocks, which provided more competition for stockbrokers. Reforms had the effect of lowering prices overall, making it easier for more people to participate in the stock market. Broker commissions for each stock sale lessened, but volume increased.\nThe Reagan years were marked by a renewed push for capitalism and business, with national efforts to de-regulate industries such as telecommunications and aviation. The economy resumed upward growth after a period in the early 1980s of languishing. A report in \"The New York Times\" described that the flushness of money and growth during these years had spawned a drug culture of sorts, with a rampant acceptance of cocaine use although the overall percent of actual users was most likely small. A reporter wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Wall Street drug dealer looked like many other successful young female executives. Stylishly dressed and wearing designer sunglasses, she sat in her 1983 Chevrolet Camaro in a no-parking zone across the street from the Marine Midland Bank branch on lower Broadway. The customer in the passenger seat looked like a successful young businessman. But as the dealer slipped him a heat-sealed plastic envelope of cocaine and he passed her cash, the transaction was being watched through the sunroof of her car by Federal drug agents in a nearby building. And the customer\u00a0\u2014 an undercover agent himself -was learning the ways, the wiles and the conventions of Wall Street's drug subculture.\u2014\u200a\nIn 1987, the stock market plunged, and, in the relatively brief recession following, the surrounding area lost 100,000 jobs according to one estimate. Since telecommunications costs were coming down, banks and brokerage firms could move away from the Financial District to more affordable locations. One of the firms looking to move away was the NYSE. In 1998, the NYSE and the city struck a $900 million deal which kept the NYSE from moving across the river to Jersey City; the deal was described as the \"largest in city history to prevent a corporation from leaving town\".\n21st century.\nIn 2001, the \"Big Board\", as some termed the NYSE, was described as the world's \"largest and most prestigious stock market\". When the World Trade Center was destroyed on September 11, 2001, the attacks \"crippled\" the communications network and destroyed many buildings in the Financial District, although the buildings on Wall Street itself saw only little physical damage. One estimate was that 45% of Wall Street's \"best office space\" had been lost. The NYSE was determined to re-open on September 17, almost a week after the attack. During this time Rockefeller Group Business Center opened additional offices at 48 Wall Street. Still, after September 11, the financial services industry went through a downturn with a sizable drop in year-end bonuses of $6.5 billion, according to one estimate from a state comptroller's office.\nTo guard against terrorist attacks in the area, Wall Street from Broadway to William Street, and Broad Street from Beaver to Nassau was permanently closed to vehicular traffic and pedestrianized. The intersection of Broad and Wall in front of the NYSE, is a now public square. Vehicle traffic is only allowed for local residents and those with permission from local businesses and the city and only after being subject to a security search. Authorities built concrete barriers, and found ways over time to make them more aesthetically appealing by spending $5000 to $8000 apiece on bollards. Parts of Wall Street, as well as several other streets in the neighborhood, were blocked off by specially designed bollards:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... Rogers Marvel designed a new kind of bollard, a faceted piece of sculpture whose broad, slanting surfaces offer people a place to sit in contrast to the typical bollard, which is supremely unsittable. The bollard, which is called the Nogo, looks a bit like one of Frank Gehry's unorthodox culture palaces, but it is hardly insensitive to its surroundings. Its bronze surfaces actually echo the grand doorways of Wall Street's temples of commerce. Pedestrians easily slip through groups of them as they make their way onto Wall Street from the area around historic Trinity Church. Cars, however, cannot pass.\u2014\u200a\n\"The Guardian\" reporter Andrew Clark described the years of 2006 to 2010 as \"tumultuous\", in which the heartland of America was \"mired in gloom\" with high unemployment around 9.6%, with average house prices falling from $230,000 in 2006 to $183,000, and foreboding increases in the national debt to $13.4 trillion, but that despite the setbacks, the American economy was once more \"bouncing back\". What had happened during these heady years? Clark wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;But the picture is too nuanced simply to dump all the responsibility on financiers. Most Wall Street banks didn't actually go around the US hawking dodgy mortgages; they bought and packaged loans from on-the-ground firms such as Countrywide Financial and New Century Financial, both of which hit a financial wall in the crisis. Foolishly and recklessly, the banks didn't look at these loans adequately, relying on flawed credit-rating agencies such as Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's, which blithely certified toxic mortgage-backed securities as solid ... A few of those on Wall Street, including maverick hedge fund manager John Paulson and the top brass at Goldman Sachs, spotted what was going on and ruthlessly gambled on a crash. They made a fortune but turned into the crisis's pantomime villains. Most, though, got burned\u00a0\u2013 the banks are still gradually running down portfolios of non-core loans worth $800bn.\u2014\u200a\nThe first months of 2008 was a particularly troublesome period which caused Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke to \"work holidays and weekends\" and which did an \"extraordinary series of moves\". It bolstered U.S. banks and allowed Wall Street firms to borrow \"directly from the Fed\" through a vehicle called the Fed's Discount Window, a sort of lender of last resort. These efforts were highly controversial at the time, but from the perspective of 2010, it appeared the Federal exertions had been the right decisions.\nBy 2010, Wall Street firms, in Clark's view, were \"getting back to their old selves as engine rooms of wealth, prosperity and excess\". A report by Michael Stoler in \"The New York Sun\" described a \"phoenix-like resurrection\" of the area, with residential, commercial, retail and hotels booming in the \"third largest business district in the country\".\nAt the same time, the investment community was worried about proposed legal reforms, including the \"Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\" which dealt with matters such as credit card rates and lending requirements. The NYSE closed two of its trading floors in a move towards transforming itself into an electronic exchange. Beginning in September 2011, the Occupy Wall Street movement, disenchanted with the financial system, protested in parks and plazas around Wall Street.\nOn October 29, 2012, Wall Street was disrupted when New York and New Jersey were inundated by Hurricane Sandy. Its storm surge, a local record, caused massive street flooding nearby. The NYSE was closed for weather-related reasons, the first time since Hurricane Gloria in September 1985 and the first two-day weather-related shutdown since the Blizzard of 1888.\nArchitecture.\nWall Street's architecture is generally rooted in the Gilded Age. The older skyscrapers often were built with elaborate facades, which have not been common in corporate architecture for decades. There are numerous landmarks on Wall Street, some of which were erected as the headquarters of banks. These include:\nAnother key anchor for the area is the New York Stock Exchange Building at the corner of Broad Street. It houses the New York Stock Exchange, which is by far the world's largest stock exchange per market capitalization of its listed companies, at US$28.5\u00a0trillion as of June 30, 2018. City authorities realize its importance, and believed that it has \"outgrown its neoclassical temple at the corner of Wall and Broad streets\", and in 1998, offered substantial tax incentives to try to keep it in the Financial District. Plans to rebuild it were delayed by the September 11 attacks. The exchange still occupies the same site. The exchange is the locus for a large amount of technology and data. For example, to accommodate the three thousand people who work directly on the exchange floor requires 3,500 kilowatts of electricity, along with 8,000 phone circuits on the trading floor alone, and of fiber-optic cable below ground.\nImportance.\nAs an economic engine.\nIn the New York economy.\nFinance professor Charles R. Geisst wrote that the exchange has become \"inextricably intertwined into New York's economy\". Wall Street pay, in terms of salaries and bonuses and taxes, is an important part of the economy of New York City, the tri-state metropolitan area, and the United States. Anchored by Wall Street, New York City has been called the world's most economically powerful city and leading financial center. As such, a falloff in Wall Street's economy could have \"wrenching effects on the local and regional economies\". In 2008, after a downturn in the stock market, the decline meant $18 billion less in taxable income, with less money available for \"apartments, furniture, cars, clothing and services\".\nEstimates vary about the number and quality of financial jobs in the city. One estimate was that Wall Street firms employed close to 200,000 persons in 2008. Another estimate was that in 2007, the financial services industry which had a $70 billion profit became 22 percent of the city's revenue. Another estimate (in 2006) was that the financial services industry makes up 9% of the city's work force and 31% of the tax base. An additional estimate from 2007 by Steve Malanga of the Manhattan Institute was that the securities industry accounts for 4.7 percent of the jobs in New York City but 20.7 percent of its wages, and he estimated there were 175,000 securities-industries jobs in New York (both Wall Street area and midtown) paying an average of $350,000 annually. Between 1995 and 2005, the sector grew at an annual rate of about 6.6% annually, a respectable rate, but that other financial centers were growing faster. Another estimate, made in 2008, was that Wall Street provided a fourth of all personal income earned in the city, and 10% of New York City's tax revenue. The city's securities industry, enumerating 163,400 jobs in August 2013, continues to form the largest segment of the city's financial sector and an important economic engine, accounting in 2012 for 5 percent of private sector jobs in New York City, 8.5 percent (US$3.8 billion) of the city's tax revenue, and 22 percent of the city's total wages, including an average salary of US$360,700.\nThe seven largest Wall Street firms in the 2000s were Bear Stearns, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers. During the recession of 2008\u201310, many of these firms, including Lehman, went out of business or were bought up at firesale prices by other financial firms. In 2008, Lehman filed for bankruptcy, Bear Stearns was bought by JPMorgan Chase forced by the U.S. government, and Merrill Lynch was bought by Bank of America in a similar shot-gun wedding. These failures marked a catastrophic downsizing of Wall Street as the financial industry goes through restructuring and change. Since New York's financial industry provides almost one-fourth of all income produced in the city, and accounts for 10% of the city's tax revenues and 20% of the state's, the downturn has had huge repercussions for government treasuries. New York's mayor Michael Bloomberg reportedly over a four-year period dangled over $100 million in tax incentives to persuade Goldman Sachs to build a 43-story headquarters in the Financial District near the destroyed World Trade Center site. In 2009, things looked somewhat gloomy, with one analysis by the Boston Consulting Group suggesting that 65,000 jobs had been permanently lost because of the downturn. But there were signs that Manhattan property prices were rebounding with price rises of 9% annually in 2010, and bonuses were being paid once more, with average bonuses over $124,000 in 2010.\nVersus Midtown Manhattan.\nA requirement of the New York Stock Exchange was that brokerage firms had to have offices \"clustered around Wall Street\" so clerks could deliver physical paper copies of stock certificates each week. There were some indications that midtown had been becoming the locus of financial services dealings even by 1911. But as technology progressed, in the middle and later decades of the 20th century, computers and telecommunications replaced paper notifications, meaning that the close proximity requirement could be bypassed in more situations. Many financial firms found that they could move to Midtown Manhattan, only away, and still operate effectively. For example, the former investment firm of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette was described as a \"Wall Street firm\" but had its headquarters on Park Avenue in Midtown. A report described the migration from Wall Street:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The financial industry has been slowly migrating from its historic home in the warren of streets around Wall Street to the more spacious and glamorous office towers of Midtown Manhattan. Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan Chase, Citigroup, and Bear Stearns have all moved north.\u2014\u200a\nNevertheless, a key magnet for the Wall Street remains the New York Stock Exchange Building. Some \"old guard\" firms such as Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch (bought by Bank of America in 2009), have remained \"fiercely loyal to the Financial District\" location, and new ones such as Deutsche Bank have chosen office space in the district. So-called \"face-to-face\" trading between buyers and sellers remains a \"cornerstone\" of the NYSE, with a benefit of having all of a deal's players close at hand, including investment bankers, lawyers, and accountants.\nIn the New Jersey economy.\nAfter Wall Street firms started to expand westward in the 1980s into New Jersey, the direct economic impacts of Wall Street activities have gone beyond New York City. The employment in the financial services industry, mostly in the \"back office\" roles, has become an important part of New Jersey's economy. In 2009, the Wall Street employment wages were paid in the amount of almost $18.5 billion in the state. The industry contributed $39.4 billion or 8.4 percent to the New Jersey's gross domestic product in the same year. The most significant area with Wall Street employment is in Jersey City. In 2008, the \"Wall Street West\" employment contributed to one third of the private sector jobs in Jersey City. Within the Financial Service cluster, there were three major sectors: more than 60 percent were in the securities industry; 20 percent were in banking; and 8 percent in insurance.\nAdditionally, New Jersey has become the main technology infrastructure to support the Wall Street operations. A substantial amount of securities traded in the United States are executed in New Jersey as the data centers of electronic trading in the U.S. equity market for all major stock exchanges are located in North and Central Jersey. A significant amount of securities clearing and settlement workforce is also in the state. This includes the majority of the workforce of Depository Trust Company, the primary U.S. securities depository; and the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation, the parent company of National Securities Clearing Corporation, the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation and Emerging Markets Clearing Corporation. Having a direct tie to Wall Street employment can be problematic for New Jersey, however. The state lost 7.9 percent of its employment base from 2007 to 2010 in the financial services sector in the fallout of the subprime mortgage crisis.\nCompeting financial centers.\nOf the street's importance as a financial center, \"New York Times\" analyst Daniel Gross wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In today's burgeoning and increasingly integrated global financial markets\u00a0\u2014 a vast, neural spaghetti of wires, Web sites and trading platforms\u00a0\u2014 the N.Y.S.E. is clearly no longer the epicenter. Nor is New York. The largest mutual-fund complexes are in Valley Forge, Pa., Los Angeles and Boston, while trading and money management are spreading globally. Since the end of the cold war, vast pools of capital have been forming overseas, in the Swiss bank accounts of Russian oligarchs, in the Shanghai vaults of Chinese manufacturing magnates and in the coffers of funds controlled by governments in Singapore, Russia, Dubai, Qatar and Saudi Arabia that may amount to some $2.5 trillion.\nAn example is the alternative trading platform known as BATS, based in Kansas City, which came \"out of nowhere to gain a 9 percent share in the market for trading United States stocks\". The firm has computers in the U.S. state of New Jersey, and only two salespeople in New York City; the remaining 33 employees work in a center in Kansas.\nIn the public imagination.\nAs a financial symbol.\nWall Street in a conceptual sense represents financial and economic power. To Americans, it can sometimes represent elitism and power politics, and its role has been a source of controversy throughout the nation's history, particularly beginning around the Gilded Age period in the late 19th century. Wall Street became the symbol of a country and economic system that many Americans see as having developed through trade, capitalism, and innovation.\nThe term \"Wall Street\" has become a metonym for the financial markets of the United States as a whole, the American financial services industry, or New York\u2013based financial interests. Wall Street has become synonymous with financial interests, often used negatively. During the subprime mortgage crisis from 2007 to 2010, Wall Street financing was blamed as one of the causes, although most commentators blame an interplay of factors. The U.S. government with the Troubled Asset Relief Program bailed out the banks and financial backers with billions of taxpayer dollars, but the bailout was often criticized as politically motivated, and was criticized by journalists as well as the public. Analyst Robert Kuttner in the \"Huffington Post\" criticized the bailout as helping large Wall Street firms such as Citigroup while neglecting to help smaller community development banks such as Chicago's ShoreBank. One writer in the \"Huffington Post\" looked at FBI statistics on robbery, fraud, and crime and concluded that Wall Street was the \"most dangerous neighborhood in the United States\" if one factored in the $50 billion fraud perpetrated by Bernie Madoff.\nWhen large firms such as Enron, WorldCom, and Global Crossing were found guilty of fraud, Wall Street was often blamed, even though these firms had headquarters around the nation and not in Wall Street. Many complained that the resulting Sarbanes-Oxley legislation dampened the business climate with regulations that were \"overly burdensome\". Interest groups seeking favor with Washington lawmakers, such as car dealers, have often sought to portray their interests as allied with \"Main Street\" rather than \"Wall Street\", although analyst Peter Overby on \"National Public Radio\" suggested that car dealers have written over $250 billion in consumer loans and have real ties with \"Wall Street\".\nWhen the United States Treasury bailed out large financial firms, to ostensibly halt a downward spiral in the nation's economy, there was tremendous negative political fallout, particularly when reports came out that monies supposed to be used to ease credit restrictions were being used to pay bonuses to highly paid employees. Analyst William D. Cohan argued that it was \"obscene\" how Wall Street reaped \"massive profits and bonuses in 2009\" after being saved by \"trillions of dollars of American taxpayers' treasure\" despite Wall Street's \"greed and irresponsible risk-taking\". \"Washington Post\" reporter Suzanne McGee called for Wall Street to make a sort of public apology to the nation, and expressed dismay that people such as Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein hadn't expressed contrition despite being sued by the SEC in 2009. McGee wrote that \"Bankers aren't the sole culprits, but their too-glib denials of responsibility and the occasional vague and waffling expression of regret don't go far enough to deflect anger.\"\nBut chief banking analyst at Goldman Sachs, Richard Ramsden, is \"unapologetic\" and sees \"banks as the dynamos that power the rest of the economy\". Ramsden believes \"risk-taking is vital\" and said in 2010:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;You can construct a banking system in which no bank will ever fail, in which there's no leverage. But there would be a cost. There would be virtually no economic growth because there would be no credit creation.\nOthers in the financial industry believe that they have been unfairly castigated by the public and by politicians. For example, Anthony Scaramucci reportedly told President Barack Obama in 2010 that he felt like a pi\u00f1ata, \"whacked with a stick\" by \"hostile politicians\". The financial misdeeds of various figures throughout American history sometimes casts a dark shadow on financial investing as a whole, and include names such as William Duer, Jim Fisk and Jay Gould (the latter two believed to have been involved with an effort to collapse the U.S. gold market in 1869) as well as modern figures such as Bernard Madoff who \"bilked billions from investors\".\nIn addition, images of Wall Street and its figures have loomed large. The 1987 Oliver Stone film \"Wall Street\" created the iconic figure of Gordon Gekko who used the phrase \"greed is good\", which caught on in the cultural parlance. Gekko is reportedly based on multiple real-life individuals on Wall Street, including corporate raider Carl Icahn, disgraced stock trader Ivan Boesky, and investor Michael Ovitz. In 2009, Stone commented how the film had had an unexpected cultural influence, not causing them to turn away from corporate greed, but causing many young people to choose Wall Street careers because of the film. A reporter repeated other lines from the film: \"I'm talking about liquid. Rich enough to have your own jet. Rich enough not to waste time. Fifty, a hundred million dollars, Buddy. A player.\" Wall Street firms have, however, also contributed to projects such as Habitat for Humanity, as well as done food programs in Haiti, trauma centers in Sudan, and rescue boats during floods in Bangladesh.\nPersonalities associated with the street.\nMany people associated with Wall Street have become famous; although in most cases their reputations are limited to members of the stock brokerage and banking communities, others have gained national and international fame. For some, like hedge fund manager Ray Dalio, their fame is due to skillful investment strategies, financing, reporting, legal or regulatory activities, while others such as Ivan Boesky, Michael Milken and Bernie Madoff are remembered for their notable failures or scandal.\nTransportation.\nWith Wall Street being historically a commuter destination, a plethora of transportation infrastructure has been developed to serve it. Pier 11 near Wall Street's eastern end is a busy terminal for New York Waterway, NYC Ferry, New York Water Taxi, and SeaStreak. The Downtown Manhattan Heliport also serves Wall Street.\nThere are three New York City Subway stations under Wall Street:\nNo bus route runs on Wall Street. The two routes intersecting are the on Water Street and the downtown on Broadway.\nFrom 1934 to the mid-1980s, Wall Street Skyport served as a seaplane base that was primarily used by suburban commuters.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOther sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Now, that doesn't always translate to on-screen gold, but it is a nice little coup for Bravo.\" \"The New York Times\" wrote that Richards \"brought a refreshing and occasionally disarming dose of reality\" to the series. On May 31, 2019, \"The Daily Beast\" wrote that \"Richards's appearance on the show is the best kind of surprise, one that reveals that a celebrity is not who we may have assumed them to be.

The film was released in limited theaters on November 15, 2019.\n2020s.\nRichards returned for \"The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\"' tenth season, which premiered on April 15, 2020. On September 10, 2020, her representative confirmed that Richards is leaving the series after two seasons. In late 2020, Richards traveled to Spain to begin filming adventure drama series \"Glow &amp; Darkness\", portraying the role of Countess of Champagne. In 2020, she appeared in five films: \"Money Plane, Switched, Reality Queen!, Alpha Code\" and \"Timecrafters: The Treasure of Pirate's Cove.\" The heist film \"Money Plane\" was released to video-on-demand services on July 10, 2020, by Quiver Distribution. In \"Switched,\" released on September 4, 2020, Richards portrayed Victoria Sharp, the mother of a school bully. On August 28, 2021, she played Amanda in Lifetime's thriller film \"Killer Cheer Mom\". The film follows a high school junior named Riley, who moved to a new town with her dad and stepmom, Amanda (Richards).\nOn November 15, 2024, Fox announced that Richards would be one of fifteen contestants to appear on the third season of reality quasi-military training television series \"\".\nIn March 2025, Richards starred in \"Denise Richards &amp; Her Wild Things\", a reality television series focusing on her and her family for Bravo. The series launched on E!. The show lasted for one season.\nOther activities.\nBusiness.\nRichards launched her self-titled fragrance in spring 2012. In November 2019, Richards announced that she has developed a skincare line with CBme Beauty.\nModeling.\nDuring her career, Richards has been on the cover of numerous magazines, including \"Cosmopolitan\" (Poland, Greece, US and Germany), \"Redbook\", \"Details\", \"Esquire\", \"Self,\" \"Shape\", \"GQ\", \"Bella\" and \"Empire.\" In December 2004, she posed for a nude pictorial in \"Playboy\" magazine, five months after giving birth.

Richards has appeared in Blues Traveler's music video for \"Canadian Rose\" and Snoop Dogg's music video for \"Undercova Funk\". In September 2019, she walked the runway for Kyle Richards' and Shahida Clayton's new clothing brand at New York Fashion Week.\nPhilanthropy.\nOutside of work, Richards dedicates much of her time to philanthropy. She has supported numerous charities, including Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption, Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, Feeding America, Much Love Animal Rescue, Barbara Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes, Best Friends Animal Society, and Children's Hospital Los Angeles. Richards has also appeared in the NOH8 Campaign and has spoken in support of gay marriage.\nRichards has worked with Best Friends Animal Society on several projects, including its Pup My Ride program, which transports small dogs from high-kill animal shelters to other parts of the US where there is a greater demand for small dogs. She promoted Best Friends Animal Society's Save Them All campaign in 2014. \"I've been involved with Best Friends Animal Society since 2009 and I've seen firsthand the differences they've made and the countless lives they've saved,\" Richards said. She has regularly appeared on \"Access Hollywood\"'s monthly pet segment showcasing shelter dogs rescued by Best Friends and available for adoption. While assisting with relief efforts in New York following Hurricane Sandy, she worked together with North Shore Animal League, and adopted a puppy from a Long Island shelter.\nShe has walked the runway for charity fashion shows, such as Susan G. Komen's 8th Annual Fashion For The Cure, Clothes Off Your Back Benefit and The Heart Truth's Red Dress Fall 2011 Collections. In January 2012, she launched her first collaboration with fashion subscription service ShoeDazzle to design the \"Eloise\" heel and raised over $15,000 for the Kidney Cancer Association. In December 2012, she designed two shoes for ShoeDazzle as part of their Celebrity Shoe Design Program for Charity. Profits from the shoe sales went to the Kidney Cancer Association. After Richards lost her mother to kidney cancer, she dedicated her time to raising awareness and helping the Kidney Cancer Association. In November 2015, Richards and her daughters spent Thanksgiving volunteering and serving food for homeless families.\nIn June 2018, she joined The Will Rogers Motion Picture Pioneers Foundation's summer theatrical PSA campaign to benefit Brave Beginnings, which funds vital neonatal equipment to U.S. hospitals. Richards filmed a public service announcement that was played at movie theaters nationwide.\nMedia image.\nRichards's appearance has often been the subject of media attention. In 1999, she was ranked #9 in \"Maxim\"'s 50 Sexiest Women. In 2001, she was voted #2 in \"FHM\"'s 100 Sexiest Women, #5 in \"FHM\"'s 100 Sexiest Women and #19 in AskMen.com's 50 Most Beautiful Women. She was named one of the \"100 Hottest Women of All-Time\" by \"Men's Health\". In 2002, Richards was ranked at number 21 in \"Stuff\" magazine's \"102 Sexiest Women in the World.\" In 2011, \"Men's Health\" ranked her at number 61 on their list of \"100 Hottest Women of All Time.\" \"Shape\" magazine ranked her at number 7 on their list of \"10 of Our Fave Bond Girls: Then and Now.\"\nPersonal life.\nRichards became engaged to actor Charlie Sheen on December 26, 2001, and they were married on June 15, 2002, at the estate of \"Spin City\" creator Gary David Goldberg. They have two daughters together. In March 2005, while pregnant with their second child, Richards filed for divorce from Sheen. She sought a restraining order against Sheen, alleging death threats against her. On April 19, 2006, Richards filed formal legal papers seeking a divorce from Sheen under the laws of the state of California. The divorce was finalized on November 30, 2006; Sheen was ordered to stay 300 feet away from his ex-wife and their daughters, except during supervised visits. In May 2010, Sheen surrendered legal custody of Sam and Lola to Richards. They previously had joint legal custody of their daughters. According to a source, Richards wanted sole legal custody, given Sheen's \"marital turmoil, sobriety issues, and criminal problems\" and he did not fight it. Under their divorce agreement, she had primary physical custody and he had visitation rights.\nBy mid-2012, Richards and Sheen were on good terms, often spending time together with their children. In 2012, Sheen made a cameo appearance in her movie \"Madea's Witness Protection,\" while Richards appeared in Sheen's television series \"Anger Management\". In a move supported by Sheen, in May 2013, Richards was awarded temporary custody of his twin sons born in 2009 to Sheen and his wife Brooke Mueller, after the children were removed from Mueller's home by child protective services due to concerns over drug use.\nIn June 2011, Richards adopted a third daughter, Eloise Joni Richards, as a single parent. Her middle name honors Richards' deceased mother. Richards adopted her at birth, following a two-year adoption process. Eloise has a rare chromosomal disorder, Monosomy 8p, which affects her speech. Richards has worked on learning sign language to communicate with her daughter.\nIn December 2017, Richards began dating Aaron Phypers before his divorce from Nicollette Sheridan was finalized. On September 8, 2018, Richards and Phypers married in Malibu, California. In May 2019, Richards announced that Phypers was adopting her youngest daughter, Eloise. On July 7, 2025, Phypers filed for divorce from Richards in Los Angeles, citing irreconcilable differences and listing their date of separation as July 4.\nRichards joined OnlyFans as a content creator in June 2022, as a gesture of support for her daughter Sami, who had attracted criticism for launching her own account. She said that she believed \"the creators of [OnlyFans] really took the best of every platform of social media and put it into one site,\" because as a creator, \"you own your content. The other sites, they can sell your content.\" Richards earns a significant income via the site. Her friend, Tori Spelling, later admitted to subscribing with a pseudonymous account and spending over $400 on content and tips in two days.\nIn July 2025, Richards was granted a temporary restraining order against her estranged husband, Aaron Phypers, whom she accused of repeated domestic violence. According to court documents, Richards claimed she had been subjected to physical assault, strangulation, multiple concussions, and death threats. She also alleged that Phypers had engaged in digital surveillance of her private communications. One of the incidents reportedly occurred in early July, shortly before Phypers filed for divorce. He has strongly denied all allegations. A court hearing is scheduled for August 2025 to determine whether a permanent restraining order will be issued.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

One of the two naturally occurring isotopes of rubidium, 87Rb, decays to 87Sr with a half-life of 49.23 billion years. The radiogenic daughter, 87Sr, produced in this decay process is the only one of the four naturally occurring strontium isotopes that was not produced exclusively by stellar nucleosynthesis predating the formation of the Solar System. Over time, decay of 87Rb increases the amount of radiogenic 87Sr while the amount of other Sr isotopes remains unchanged.\nThe ratio 87Sr/86Sr in a mineral sample can be accurately measured using a mass spectrometer. If the amount of Sr and Rb isotopes in the sample when it formed can be determined, the age can be calculated from the increase in 87Sr/86Sr. Different minerals that crystallized from the same silicic melt will all have the same initial 87Sr/86Sr as the parent melt. However, because Rb substitutes for K in minerals and these minerals have different K/Ca ratios, the minerals will have had different starting Rb/Sr ratios, and the final 87Sr/86Sr ratio will not have increased as much in the minerals poorer in Rb. Typically, Rb/Sr increases in the order plagioclase, hornblende, K-feldspar, biotite, muscovite. Therefore, given sufficient time for significant production (ingrowth) of radiogenic 87Sr, measured 87Sr/86Sr values will be different in the minerals, increasing in the same order. Comparison of different minerals in a rock sample thus allows scientists to infer the original 87Sr/86Sr ratio and determine the age of the rock.\nIn addition, Rb is a highly incompatible element that, during partial melting of the mantle, prefers to join the magmatic melt rather than remain in mantle minerals. As a result, Rb is enriched in crustal rocks relative to the mantle, and 87Sr/86Sr is higher for crust rock than mantle rock. This allows scientists to distinguish magma produced by melting of crust rock from magma produced by melting of mantle rock, even if subsequent magma differentiation produces similar overall chemistry. Scientists can also estimate from 87Sr/86Sr when crust rock was first formed from magma extracted from the mantle, even if the rock is subsequently metamorphosed or even melted and recrystallized. This provides clues to the age of the Earth's continents.\nDevelopment of this process was aided by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, who discovered nuclear fission in December 1938.\nExample.\nFor example, consider the case of an igneous rock such as a granite that contains several major Sr-bearing minerals including plagioclase feldspar, K-feldspar, hornblende, biotite, and muscovite. Each of these minerals has a different initial rubidium/strontium ratio dependent on their potassium content, the concentration of Rb and K in the melt and the temperature at which the minerals formed. Rubidium substitutes for potassium within the lattice of minerals at a rate proportional to its concentration within the melt.\nThe ideal scenario according to Bowen's reaction series would see a granite melt begin crystallizing a cumulate assemblage of plagioclase and hornblende (i.e.; tonalite or diorite), which is low in K (and hence Rb) but high in Sr (as this substitutes for Ca), which proportionally enriches the melt in K and Rb. This then causes orthoclase and biotite, both K rich minerals into which Rb can substitute, to precipitate. The resulting Rb\u2013Sr ratios and Rb and Sr abundances of both the whole rocks and their component minerals will be markedly different. This, thus, allows a different rate of radiogenic Sr to evolve in the separate rocks and their component minerals as time progresses.\nCalculating the age.\nThe age of a sample is determined by analysing several minerals within multiple subsamples from different parts of the original sample. The 87Sr/86Sr ratio for each subsample is plotted against its 87Rb/86Sr ratio on a graph called an . If these form a straight line then the subsamples are consistent, and the age probably reliable. The slope of the line dictates the age of the sample.\nGiven the universal law of radioactive decay and the following rubidium beta decay: &lt;chem&gt;^{87}_{37}Rb -&gt;[{\\beta^-}]~^{87}_{38}Sr ~+e^-\\ + \\bar{\\nu}_e&lt;/chem&gt;, we obtain the expression which describes the growth of strontium-87 from the decay of rubidium-87:formula_1&lt;chem&gt;\\lambda&lt;/chem&gt; being the decay constant of rubidium. Furthermore, we consider the number of &lt;chem&gt;^{86}_{38}Sr&lt;/chem&gt; as a constant, since it is stable and not radiogenic. Hence, formula_2is the isochron equation. After measurements of Rubidum and Strontium concentration in the mineral we can easily determine the age, the t value, of the sample.\nSources of error.\nRb\u2013Sr dating relies on correctly measuring the Rb\u2013Sr ratio of a mineral or whole rock sample, plus deriving an accurate 87Sr/86Sr ratio for the mineral or whole rock sample.\nSeveral preconditions must be satisfied before a Rb\u2013Sr date can be considered as representing the time of emplacement or formation of a rock.\nOne of the major drawbacks (and, conversely, the most important use) of utilizing Rb and Sr to derive a radiometric date is their relative mobility, especially in hydrothermal fluids. Rb and Sr are relatively mobile alkaline elements and as such are relatively easily moved around by the hot, often carbonated hydrothermal fluids present during metamorphism or magmatism.\nConversely, these fluids may metasomatically alter a rock, introducing new Rb and Sr into the rock (generally during potassic alteration or calcic (albitisation) alteration. Rb\u2013Sr can then be used on the altered mineralogy to date the time of this alteration, but not the date at which the rock formed.\nThus, assigning \"age significance\" to a result requires studying the metasomatic and thermal history of the rock, any metamorphic events, and any evidence of fluid movement. A Rb\u2013Sr date which is at variance with other geochronometers may not be useless, it may be providing data on an event which is not representing the age of formation of the rock.\nUses.\nGeochronology.\nThe Rb\u2013Sr dating method has been used extensively in dating terrestrial and lunar rocks, and meteorites. If the initial amount of Sr is known or can be extrapolated, the age can be determined by measurement of the Rb and Sr concentrations and the 87Sr/86Sr ratio. The dates indicate the true age of the minerals only if the rocks have not been subsequently altered.\nThe important concept in isotopic tracing is that Sr derived from any mineral through weathering reactions will have the same 87Sr/86Sr as the mineral. Although this is a potential source of error for terrestrial rocks, it is irrelevant for lunar rocks and meteorites, as there are no chemical weathering reactions in those environments.\nIsotope geochemistry.\nInitial 87Sr/86Sr ratios are a useful tool in archaeology, forensics and paleontology because the 87Sr/86Sr of a skeleton, sea shell or indeed a clay artefact is directly comparable to the source rocks upon which it was formed or upon which the organism lived. Thus, by measuring the current-day 87Sr/86Sr ratio (and often the 143Nd\u2013144Nd ratios as well) the geological fingerprint of an object or skeleton can be measured, allowing migration patterns to be determined.\nStrontium isotope stratigraphy.\nStrontium isotope stratigraphy relies on recognised variations in the 87Sr/86Sr ratio of seawater over time. The application of Sr isotope stratigraphy is generally limited to carbonate samples for which the Sr seawater curve is well defined. This is well known for the Cenozoic time-scale but, due to poorer preservation of carbonate sequences in the Mesozoic and earlier, it is not completely understood for older sequences. In older sequences diagenetic alteration combined with greater uncertainties in estimating absolute ages due to lack of overlap between other geochronometers (for example U\u2013Th) leads to greater uncertainties in the exact shape of the Sr isotope seawater curve.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37278", "revid": "10289486", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37278", "title": "Galago", "text": "Family of primates\nGalagos , also known as bush babies or nagapies (meaning \"night monkeys\" in Afrikaans), are small nocturnal primates native to continental, sub-Sahara Africa, and make up the family Galagidae (also sometimes called Galagonidae). They are considered a sister group of the Lorisidae.\nAccording to some accounts, the name \"bush baby\" comes from either the animal's cries or its appearance. The Ghanaian name \"aposor\" is given to them because of their firm grip on branches.\nIn both variety and abundance, the bush babies are the most successful strepsirrhine primates in Africa, according to the African Wildlife Foundation.\nTaxonomic classification and phylogeny.\nGalagos are currently grouped into six genera. \"Euoticus\" is a basal sister taxon to all the other galagids. The 'dwarf' galagids recently grouped under the genus \"Galagoides\" have been found, based on genetic data, and supported by analysis of vocalisations and morphology, to actually consist of two clades, which are not sister taxa, in eastern and western/central Africa (separated by the rift valley). The latter are basal to all the other non-\"Euoticus\" galagids. The former group is sister to \"Galago\" and has been elevated to full genus status as \"Paragalago\". The genera \"Otolemur\" and \"Sciurocheirus\" are also sisters.\nFamily Galagidae - galagos, or bushbabies\nThe phylogeny of Galagidae according to Masters \"et al.\", 2017 is as follows:\nCharacteristics.\nGalagos have large eyes, allowing them good night vision, in addition to other characteristics, like strong hind limbs, acute hearing, and long tails that help them balance. Their ears are bat-like and allow them to track insects in the dark. They catch insects on the ground or snatch them out of the air. They are fast, agile creatures. As they bound through the thick bushes, they fold their delicate ears back to protect them. They also fold them during rest. They have nails on most of their digits, except for the second toe of the hind foot, which bears a grooming claw. Their diet is a mixture of insects and other small animals, fruit, and tree gums. They have pectinate (comb-like) incisors called toothcombs, and the dental formula: 2.1.3.32.1.3.3 They are active at night.\nAfter a gestation period of 110\u2013133 days, young galagos are born with half-closed eyes and are initially unable to move about independently. After a few (6\u20138) days, the mother carries the infant in her mouth, and places it on branches while feeding. Females may have singles, twins, or triplets, and may become very aggressive. Each newborn weighs less than . For the first three days, the infant is kept in constant contact with the mother. The young are fed by the mother for six weeks and can feed themselves at two months. The young grow rapidly, often causing the mother to walk awkwardly as she transports them.\nFemales maintain a territory shared with their offspring, though males leave their mothers' territories after puberty. Thus social groups consist of closely related females and their young. Adult males maintain separate territories, which overlap with those of the female social groups; generally, one adult male mates with all the females in an area. Males that have not established such territories sometimes form small bachelor groups.\nBush-babies are sometimes kept as pets, and like many other nonhuman primates, they are a likely sources of diseases that can cross species barriers. Equally, they are very likely to attract attention from customs officials on importation into many countries. Reports from veterinary and zoological sources indicate captive lifetimes of 12.0 to 16.5 years, suggesting a natural lifetime over a decade.\nGalagos communicate by calling to each other and by marking their paths with urine. By following the scent of urine, they can land on exactly the same branch every time. Each species produces a unique set of loud calls that have different functions. One function is to identify individuals as members of a particular species across distances. Scientists can recognize all known galago species by their 'loud calls'. At the end of the night, group members use a special rallying call and gather to sleep in a nest of leaves, a group of branches, or a hole in a tree.\nJumping.\nGalagos have remarkable jumping abilities. The highest reliably reported jump for a galago is . According to a study published by the Royal Society, given the body mass of each animal and the fact that the leg muscles amount to about 25% of this, galago's jumping muscles should perform six to nine times better than those of a frog. This is thought to be due to elastic energy storage in tendons of the lower leg, allowing far greater jumps than would otherwise be possible for an animal of their size. In mid-flight, they tuck their arms and legs close to the body; they bring them out at the last second to grab a branch. In a series of leaps, a galago can cover ten yards in mere seconds. The tail, which is longer than the length of the head and body combined, assists the legs in powering the jumps. They may also hop like a kangaroo or simply run or walk on four legs. Such strong, complicated, and coordinated movements are due to the rostral half of the posterior parietal cortex that is linked to the motor, premotor, and visuomotor areas of the frontal cortex.\nBehaviour.\nGenerally, the social structure of the galago has components of both social life and solitary life. This can be seen in their play. They swing off branches or climb high and throw things. Social play includes play fights, play grooming, and following-play. During following-play, two galagos jump sporadically and chase each other through the trees. The older galagos in a group prefer to rest alone, while younger ones are in constant contact with one another. This is observed in the \"Galago garnetti\" species. Mothers often leave infants alone for long periods and do not try to stop them from leaving. On the other hand, the offspring tries to stay close to, and initiate social interactions with the mother.\nGrooming is a very important part of galago daily life. They often groom themselves before, during, and after rest. Social grooming is done more often by males in the group. Females often reject attempts by males to groom them.\nRelationship with humans.\nThe name \"bush baby\" also refers to a myth that is used to scare children into staying indoors at night. Their baby-like cry is most likely the basis of the myth, about a powerful animal that can kidnap humans. It is also said in Nigeria that wild bush babies can never be found dead on plain ground. Rather, they make a nest of sticks, leaves or branches to die in.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "37281", "revid": "50717717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37281", "title": "Peg solitaire", "text": "Board game for one player\nPeg Solitaire, Solo Noble, Solo Goli, Marble Solitaire or simply Solitaire is a board game for one player involving movement of pegs on a board with holes. Some sets use marbles in a board with indentations. The game is known as solitaire in Britain and as peg solitaire in the US where 'solitaire' is the common name for patience. \nThe first evidence of the game can be traced back to the court of Louis XIV, and the specific date of 1697, with an engraving made ten years later by Claude Auguste Berey of Anne de Rohan-Chabot, Princess of Soubise, with the puzzle by her side. The August 1697 edition of the French literary magazine \"Mercure galant\" contains a description of the board, rules and sample problems. This is the first known reference to the game in print.\nThe standard game fills the entire board with pegs except for the central hole. The objective is, making valid moves, to empty the entire board except for a solitary peg in the central hole.\nBoard.\nThere are two traditional boards ('.' as an initial peg, 'o' as an initial hole):\nPlay.\nA valid move is to jump a peg orthogonally over an adjacent peg into a hole two positions away and then to remove the jumped peg.\nIn the diagrams which follow, codice_1 indicates a peg in a hole, codice_2 emboldened indicates the peg to be moved, and codice_3 indicates an empty hole. A blue codice_4 is the hole the current peg moved from; a red codice_2 is the final position of that peg, a red codice_3 is the hole of the peg that was jumped and removed.\nThus valid moves in each of the four orthogonal directions are:\n * \u00b7 o \u2192 \u00a4 o * \"Jump to right\"\n o \u00b7 * \u2192 * o \u00a4 \"Jump to left\"\n \u00b7 \u2192 o \"Jump down\"\n o *\n o *\n \u00b7 \u2192 o \"Jump up\"\nOn an English board, the first three moves might be:\n \u00b7 * \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00a4 \u00b7 \u00b7 o \u00b7 \u00b7 * \u00b7 \n \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 o \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00a4 o * \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 o o o \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 o \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 * \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00a4 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\nStrategy.\nThere are many different solutions to the standard problem, and one notation used to describe them assigns letters to the holes (although numbers may also be used):\n English European\n a b c a b c\n d e f y d e f z\n g h i j k l m g h i j k l m\n n o p x P O N n o p x P O N\n M L K J I H G M L K J I H G\n F E D Z F E D Y\n C B A C B A\nThis mirror image notation is used, amongst other reasons, since on the European board, one set of alternative games is to start with a hole at some position and to end with a single peg in its mirrored position. On the English board the equivalent alternative games are to start with a hole and end with a peg at the same position.\nThere is no solution to the European board with the initial hole centrally located, if only orthogonal moves are permitted. This is easily seen as follows, by an argument from Hans Zantema. Divide the positions of the board into A, B and C positions as follows:\n A B C\n A B C A B\n A B C A B C A\n B C A B C A B\n C A B C A B C\n B C A B C\n A B C\nInitially with only the central position free, the number of covered A positions is 12, the number of covered B positions is 12, and also the number of covered C positions is 12. After every move the number of covered A positions increases or decreases by one, and the same for the number of covered B positions and the number of covered C positions. Hence after an even number of moves all these three numbers are even, and after an odd number of moves all these three numbers are odd. Hence a final position with only one peg cannot be reached, since that would require that one of these numbers is one (the position of the peg, one is odd), while the other two numbers are zero, hence even.\nThere are, however, several other configurations where a single initial hole can be reduced to a single peg.\nA tactic that can be used is to divide the board into packages of three and to purge (remove) them entirely using one extra peg, the catalyst, that \"jumps out\" and then \"jumps back again\". In the example below, the * is the catalyst.:\n * \u00b7 o \u00a4 o * o * \u00b7 * o \u00a4\n \u00b7 \u2192 \u00b7 \u2192 o \u2192 o\n \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00a4 o\nThis technique can be used with a line of 3, a block of 2\u00b73 and a 6-peg L shape with a base of length 3 and upright of length 4.\nOther alternate games include starting with two empty holes and finishing with two pegs in those holes. Also starting with one hole \"here\" and ending with one peg \"there\". On an English board, the hole can be anywhere and the final peg can only end up where multiples of three permit. Thus a hole at a can only leave a single peg at a, p, O or C.\nStudies on peg solitaire.\nA thorough analysis of the game is known. This analysis introduced a notion called pagoda function which is a strong tool to show the infeasibility of a given generalized peg solitaire problem.\nA solution for finding a pagoda function, which demonstrates the infeasibility of a given problem, is formulated as a linear programming problem and solvable in polynomial time.\nA paper in 1990 dealt with the generalized Hi-Q problems which are equivalent to the peg solitaire problems and showed their NP-completeness.\nA 1996 paper formulated a peg solitaire problem as a combinatorial optimization problem and discussed the properties of the feasible region called 'a solitaire cone'.\nIn 1999 peg solitaire was completely solved on a computer using an exhaustive search through all possible variants. It was achieved making use of the symmetries, efficient storage of board constellations and hashing.\nIn 2001 an efficient method for solving peg solitaire problems was developed.\nAn unpublished study from 1989 on a generalized version of the game on the English board showed that each possible problem in the generalized game has 29 possible distinct solutions, excluding symmetries, as the English board contains 9 distinct 3\u00d73 sub-squares. One consequence of this analysis is to put a lower bound on the size of possible \"inverted position\" problems, in which the cells initially occupied are left empty and vice versa. Any solution to such a problem must contain a minimum of 11 moves, irrespective of the exact details of the problem.\nIt can be proved using abstract algebra that there are only 5 fixed board positions where the game can successfully end with one peg.\nSolutions to the English game.\nThe shortest solution to the standard English game involves 18 moves, counting multiple jumps as single moves:\nThis solution was found in 1912 by Ernest Bergholt and proven to be the shortest possible by John Beasley in 1964.\nThis solution can also be seen on https://, which is designed to make memorizing the solution easier.\nOther solutions include the following list. In these, the notation used is\nBrute force attack on standard English peg solitaire.\nThe only place it is possible to end up with a solitary peg is the centre, or the middle of one of the edges; on the last jump, there will always be an option of choosing whether to end in the centre or the edge.\nFollowing is a table over the number (Possible Board Positions) of possible board positions after n jumps, and the possibility of the same peg moved to make a further jump (No Further Jumps). Interesting to note is that the shortest way to fail the game is in six moves, and the solution (besides its rotations and reflections) is unique. An example of this is as follows: 4 \u2192 16; 23 \u2192 9; 14 \u2192 16; 17 \u2192 15; 19 \u2192 17; 31 \u2192 23. (In this notation, the pegs are numbered from left to right, starting with 0, and moving down each row and to the far left once each row is marked.)\nNOTE: If one board position can be rotated and/or flipped into another board position, the board positions are counted as identical.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSince there can only be 31 jumps, modern computers can easily examine all game positions in a reasonable time.\nThe above sequence \"PBP\" has been entered as in OEIS. Note that the total number of reachable board positions (sum of the sequence) is 23,475,688, while the total number of possible board positions is 8,589,934,590 (33bit-1) (2^33), so only about 2.2% of all possible board positions can be reached starting with the center vacant.\nIt is also possible to generate all board positions. The results below have been obtained using\nthe mCRL2 toolset (see the peg_solitaire example in the distribution).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn the results below, it has generated all the board positions it really reached starting with the center vacant and finishing in the central hole.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSolutions to the European game.\nThere are 3 initial non-congruent positions that have solutions.

It has also been played on a triangular board, with jumps allowed in all 3 directions. As long as the variant has the proper \u201cparity\u201d and is large enough, it will probably be solvable. In 2025, YouTuber Michael Stevens laid out each of these variants on one board. He called it \u201cOmnijump\u201d.\nA common triangular variant has five pegs on a side. A solution where the final peg arrives at the initial empty hole is not possible for a hole in one of the three central positions. An empty corner-hole setup can be solved in ten moves, and an empty midside-hole setup in nine (Bell 2008):\nVideo game.\nOn June 26, 1992, a video game based on peg solitaire was released for the Game Boy. Titled simply \"Solitaire\", the game was developed by Hect.

The puzzle dubbed \"Chinese Checkers\" is actually peg solitaire.\nCracker Barrel features the game at every table at their locations. The board featured is triangular with 15 total holes.\nIn \"\", the main antagonist, Vincent Volaju, spends most of his free time playing peg solitaire.

{"id": "37282", "revid": "1319247436", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37282", "title": "Klondike (solitaire)", "text": "Solitaire card game\nKlondike is a card game for one player and the best known and most popular version of the patience or solitaire family, as well as one of the most challenging in widespread play. It has spawned numerous variants including Batsford, Easthaven, King Albert, Thumb and Pouch, Somerset or Usk and Whitehead, as well as the American variants of the games, Agnes and Westcliff. The distinguishing feature of all variants is a triangular layout of the tableau, building in ascending sequence and packing in descending order.\nName.\nIn the U.S. and Canada, it is so well known that the term \"Solitaire\", in the absence of qualifiers, typically refers to Klondike. Equally in the UK, it is often just known as \"Patience\". Elsewhere the game is known as American Patience.\nHistorically, Klondike was also called Canfield in America, perhaps because it was a casino game at the Canfield Casino in Saratoga Springs, New York; this is the name by which it became known in England. Today, however, Canfield is more usually the American name for the patience game called \"Demon\" in England, which is a different game altogether. Likewise the rumour prevails that this other game was devised by Richard Canfield even though Canfield himself called his game \"Klondike\".\nHistory.\nThe origins of the name Klondike are unknown; a handful of authors have speculated the name derives from the late 19th-century Klondike Gold Rush, but no material evidence substantiates such a claim. The earliest rules for the game known as Klondike today appear in the 1907 edition of \"Hoyle's Games\" under the name \"Seven-Card Klondike\". \"Hoyles\" calls it a simpler version of \"Klondike\", also described in the same book, but which turns out to be a gambling version of the game nowadays known as Canfield in the US and Demon elsewhere in the world.\nIn the 1913 edition of the so-called \"Official Rules of Card Games\", Seven-Card Klondike has become Klondike, with the modification that the pack is run through one card at a time instead of three, and the original Klondike is now being called Canfield.\nKlondike's inclusion in Microsoft Windows in the 1990s in the form of \"Microsoft Solitaire\" contributed significantly to its current popularity. It is considered the most popular version of solitaire.\nRules.\nKlondike is played with a standard 52-card deck, without Jokers.\nAfter shuffling, a tableau of seven fanned piles of cards is laid from left to right. From left to right, each pile contains one more card than the last. The first and left-most pile contains a single upturned card, the second pile contains two cards, and so forth. The topmost card of each pile is turned face up.\nThe remaining cards from the stock are placed facedown at the upper left of the layout.\nThe four foundations (light rectangles in the upper right of the figure) are built up by suit from Ace (low in this game) to King, and the tableau piles can be built down by alternate colors. Every face-up card in a partial pile, or a complete pile, can be moved, as a unit, to another tableau pile on the basis of its highest card. Any empty piles can be filled with a King, or a pile of cards with a King. The aim of the game is to build up four stacks of cards starting with Ace and ending with King, all of the same suit, on one of the four foundations, at which time the player would have won.\nThere are different ways of dealing the remainder of the deck from the stock to the waste, including the following:\nIf the player can no longer make any meaningful moves, the game is considered lost.\nProbability of winning.\nThe probability of being able to win a game of Klondike with best-possible play is not known, and the inability of theoreticians to precisely calculate these odds has been referred to by mathematician Persi Diaconis as \"one of the embarrassments of applied probability\".\nAn upper bound on the probability of winning can be found by considering a modified version of the game called \"Thoughtful Solitaire\" or \"Thoughtful Klondike\", in which location of all 52 cards is known.\nThe probability of winning Thoughtful Klondike (with draw three rules) has been estimated at 81.942% \u00b1 0.081%. However the probability of winning regular Klondike is smaller, because sometimes there is no way of knowing the correct move without being able to see the downturned cards.\nFor the most common variant (turn three cards, unlimited passes), a number of studies have been made. A Klondike-playing AI using Monte Carlo tree search was able to solve up to 35% of randomly generated games. Another algorithm has a winning rate of 52% in \"turn one\" mode, and 18% in \"turn three\". These results place a lower bound on the winnability percentage. One experiment found a skilled human player could win 189 out of 442 games (43%).\n\"Hoyle's Rules of Games\" suggests the chances of winning as being 1 in 30 games, when there is only one pass through the deck.\nVariants.\nSingle deck.\nBelow are some single-pack variants of Klondike:\nGambling variant.\nIn some casinos, Klondike is turned into a gambling game, by playing with the rule of dealing cards one at a time and going through the stock once. For example, a player would pay $50 to play, and the house would pay $5 for each card played to the foundations. This form of Klondike is sometimes called Las Vegas Solitaire.\nJoker Solitaire.\nJoker Solitaire is a variant of Klondike created by Joli Quentin Kansil which adds two jokers that serve as limited wild cards.\nDouble Solitaire.\nKlondike has been turned into a two-player game under the name Double Solitaire. Players have their own packs and may not play to each other's tableaus but share their foundations. Players take turns until they are unable to play a card from their talons. The first player to play all 52 cards is the winner. Informally, \"Double\" Solitaire can be played as a party game with more than 2 players.\nComputerized versions.\nDigital versions of Klondike have helped popularize the game and offer advantages over playing with a physical deck. Notable examples of computerized versions include:\nScoring in the Microsoft Windows Solitaire version of Klondike is as follows:\nMoving cards directly from the Waste stack to a Foundation scores 10 points. However, if the card is first moved to a Tableau, and then to a Foundation, an extra 5 points are scored making a total of 15. Thus, to score the most points, no cards should be moved directly from the Waste to Foundation.\nTime also plays a role, if the 'Timed game' option is selected. In this case, 2 points are deducted every 10 seconds. Bonus points are scored using the formula 700,000 \u00f7 (seconds to finish), if the game takes at least 30 seconds. If the game takes under 30 seconds, no bonus points are awarded.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Her novels include the Pulitzer Prize-winning \"So Big\" (1924), \"Show Boat\" (1926; made into the celebrated 1927 musical), \"Cimarron\" (1930; adapted into the 1931 film which won the Academy Award for Best Picture), \"Giant\" (1952; made into the 1956 film of the same name) and \"Ice Palace\" (1958), which also received a film adaptation in 1960. She helped adapt her short story \"Old Man Minick\", published in 1922, into a play (\"Minick\") and it was thrice adapted to film, in 1925 as the silent film \"Welcome Home\", in 1932 as \"The Expert\", and in 1939 as \"No Place to Go\".\nLife and career.\nEarly years.\nFerber was born August 15, 1885, in Kalamazoo, Michigan, to a Hungarian-born Jewish storekeeper, Jacob Charles Ferber, and his Milwaukee, Wisconsin\u2013born wife, Julia (Neumann) Ferber, who was of German Jewish descent. The Ferbers had moved to Kalamazoo from Chicago, Illinois, in order to open a dry goods store, and her older sister Fannie was born there three years earlier.\nFerber's father was not adept at business, and the family moved often during Ferber's childhood.\nFrom Kalamazoo, they returned to Chicago for a year, and then\nmoved to Ottumwa, Iowa, where they resided from 1890 to 1897 (ages 5 to 12 for Ferber).\nIn Ottumwa, Ferber and her family faced brutal anti-Semitism, including adult males verbally abusing, mocking and spitting on her on days when she brought lunch to her father, often mocking her in a Yiddish accent. \nAccording to Ferber, her years in Ottumwa \"must be held accountable for anything in me that is hostile toward the world\".\nDuring this time, Ferber's father began to lose his eyesight, necessitating costly and ultimately unsuccessful treatments. At the age of 12, Ferber and her family moved to Appleton, Wisconsin, where she graduated from high school and later briefly attended Lawrence University.\nCareer.\nAfter graduation, Ferber planned to study elocution, with vague thoughts of someday becoming an actress, but her family could not afford to send her to college. \nOn the spur of the moment, she took a job as a cub reporter at the \"Appleton Daily Crescent\" and subsequently moved to the \"Milwaukee Journal.\" In early 1909, Ferber suffered a bout of anemia and returned to Appleton to recuperate. She never resumed her career as a reporter, although she subsequently covered the 1920 Republican National Convention and 1920 Democratic National Convention for the United Press Association, and newspaper work was a theme in her first novel, \"Dawn O'Hara, The Girl Who Laughed\", and the later \"Cimarron.\"\nWhile Ferber was recovering, she began writing and selling short stories to various magazines, and in 1911 she published her first novel, \"Dawn O'Hara, The Girl Who Laughed\". In 1912, a collection of her short stories was published in a volume titled \"Buttered Side Down\". In her autobiography, Ferber wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In that day, and for a girl in her early twenties, they were rather hard tough stories... The book got good reviews. I was startled and grimly pleased when some of the reviewers said that obviously these stories had been written by a man who had taken a feminine nom de plume as a hoax. I have always thought that a writing style should be impossible of sex determination; I don't think the reader should be able to say whether a book has been written by a man or a woman.\nIn 1925, she won the Pulitzer Prize for her book \"So Big\". Ferber initially believed her draft of what would become \"So Big\" lacked a plot, glorified failure, and had a subtle theme that could easily be overlooked. When she sent the book to her usual publisher, Doubleday, she was surprised to learn that he greatly enjoyed the novel. This was reflected by the several hundreds of thousands of copies of the novel sold to the public. Following the award, the novel was made into a silent film starring Colleen Moore that same year. A remake followed in 1932, starring Barbara Stanwyck and George Brent, with Bette Davis in a supporting role. A 1953 version of \"So Big\" starring Jane Wyman is the most popular version to modern audiences.\nRiding the popularity of \"So Big\", Ferber's next novel, \"Show Boat\" in 1926, was just as successful. Shortly after its release, composer Jerome Kern proposed turning it into a musical. Ferber was shocked, thinking it would be transformed into a typical light entertainment of the 1920s. It was not until Kern explained that he and Oscar Hammerstein II wanted to create a different type of musical that Ferber granted him the rights and it premiered on Broadway in 1927, and it has been revived eight times.\nHer 1952 novel \"Giant\" became the basis of the 1956 movie, starring Elizabeth Taylor, James Dean and Rock Hudson.\nFerber was reportedly the first author to assign film rights to her books on short-term contracts so that the rights needed to be renegotiated regularly.\nDeath.\nFerber died at her home in New York City, of stomach cancer, at the age of 82. She left her estate to her sister and nieces.\nPersonal life.\nFerber never married, had no children, and is not known to have engaged in a romance or sexual relationship.\nIn her early novel \"Dawn O'Hara\", the title character's aunt remarks, \"Being an old maid was a great deal like death by drowning \u2013 a really delightful sensation when you ceased struggling.\" Ferber did take a maternal interest in the career of her niece Janet Fox, an actress who performed in the original Broadway casts of Ferber's plays \"Dinner at Eight\" (1932) and \"Stage Door\" (1936).\nFerber was known for being outspoken and having a quick wit. On one occasion, she led other Jewish guests in leaving a house party after learning the host was antisemitic. Once, after No\u00ebl Coward joked about how her suit made her resemble a man, she replied, \"So does yours.\"\nImportance of Jewish identity.\nStarting in 1922, Ferber began to visit Europe once or twice annually for thirteen or fourteen years. During this time and unlike most Americans, she became troubled by the rise of the Nazi Party and its spreading of the antisemitic prejudice she had faced in her childhood. She commented on this saying, \"It was a fearful thing to see a continent \u2013 a civilization \u2013 crumbling before one's eyes. It was a rapid and seemingly inevitable process to which no one paid any particular attention.\" Her fears greatly influenced her work, which often featured themes of racial and cultural discrimination. Her 1938 autobiography, \"A Peculiar Treasure\", originally included a spiteful dedication to Adolf Hitler which stated: To Adolf Hitler, who has made me a better Jew and a more understanding human being, as he has of millions of other Jews, this book is dedicated in loathing and contempt.While this was changed by the time of the book's publication, it still alluded to the Nazi threat. She frequently mentions Jewish success in her book, alluding to and wanting to show not just that Jewish success, but Jews being able to use that and prevail.\nAlgonquin Round Table.\nFerber was a member of the Algonquin Round Table, a group of wits who met for lunch every day at the Algonquin Hotel in New York. Ferber and another member of the Round Table, Alexander Woollcott, were long-time enemies, their antipathy lasting until Woollcott's death in 1943, although Howard Teichmann states in his biography of Woollcott that their feud was due to a misunderstanding. According to Teichmann, Ferber once described Woollcott as \"a New Jersey Nero who has mistaken his pinafore for a toga\".\nFerber collaborated with Round Table member George S. Kaufman on several plays presented on Broadway: \"Minick\" (1924), \"The Royal Family\" (1927), \"Dinner At Eight\" (1932), \"The Land Is Bright\" (1941), \"Stage Door\" (1936), and \"Bravo!\" (1948).\nPolitical views.\nIn a poll carried out by the \"Saturday Review of Literature\", asking American writers which presidential candidate they supported in the 1940 election, Ferber endorsed Franklin D. Roosevelt.\nCharacteristics of works.\nFerber's novels generally featured strong female protagonists, along with a rich and diverse collection of supporting characters. She usually highlighted at least one strong secondary character who faced discrimination, ethnic or otherwise.\nFerber's works often concerned small subsets of American culture, and sometimes took place in exotic locations she had visited but was not intimately familiar with, such as Texas or Alaska. She thus helped to highlight the diversity of American culture to those who did not have the opportunity to experience it. Some novels are set in places she had not visited.\nList of works.\nFerber wrote thirteen novels, two autobiographies, numerous short stories, and nine plays, many which were written in collaborations with other playwrights.\nReferences.\nEndnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

There are two main types of tumors: malignant (cancerous) tumors and benign (non-cancerous) tumors. These can be further classified as primary tumors, which start within the brain, and secondary tumors, which most commonly have spread from tumors located outside the brain, known as brain metastasis tumors. All types of brain tumors may produce symptoms that vary depending on the size of the tumor and the part of the brain that is involved. Where symptoms exist, they may include headaches, seizures, problems with vision, vomiting and mental changes. Other symptoms may include difficulty walking, speaking, with sensations, or unconsciousness.\nThe cause of most brain tumors is unknown, though up to 4% of brain cancers may be caused by CT scan radiation. Uncommon risk factors include exposure to vinyl chloride, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, ionizing radiation, and inherited syndromes such as neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, and von Hippel-Lindau Disease. Studies on mobile phone exposure have not shown a clear risk. The most common types of primary tumors in adults are meningiomas (usually benign) and astrocytomas such as glioblastomas. In children, the most common type is a malignant medulloblastoma. Diagnosis is usually by medical examination along with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The result is then often confirmed by a biopsy. Based on the findings, the tumors are divided into different grades of severity.\nTreatment may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. If seizures occur, anticonvulsant medication may be needed. Dexamethasone and furosemide are medications that may be used to decrease swelling around the tumor. Some tumors grow gradually, requiring only monitoring and possibly needing no further intervention. Treatments that use a person's immune system are being studied. Outcomes for malignant tumors vary considerably depending on the type of tumor and how far it has spread at diagnosis. Although benign tumors only grow in one area, they may still be life-threatening depending on their size and location. Malignant glioblastomas usually have very poor outcomes, while benign meningiomas usually have good outcomes. The average five-year survival rate for all (malignant) brain cancers in the United States is 33%.\nSecondary, or metastatic, brain tumors are about four times as common as primary brain tumors, with about half of metastases coming from lung cancer. Primary brain tumors occur in around 250,000 people a year globally, and make up less than 2% of cancers. In children younger than 15, brain tumors are second only to acute lymphoblastic leukemia as the most common form of cancer. In New South Wales, Australia in 2005, the average lifetime economic cost of a case of brain cancer was AU$1.9 million, the greatest of any type of cancer.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSigns and symptoms.\nThe signs and symptoms of brain tumors are broad. People may experience symptoms regardless of whether the tumor is benign (not cancerous) or cancerous. Primary and secondary brain tumors present with similar symptoms, depending on the location, size, and rate of growth of the tumor. For example, larger tumors in the frontal lobe can cause changes in the ability to think. However, a smaller tumor in an area such as Wernicke's area (small area responsible for language comprehension) can result in a greater loss of function.\nHeadaches.\nHeadaches as a result of raised intracranial pressure can be an early symptom of brain cancer. However, isolated headache without other symptoms is rare, and other symptoms including visual abnormalities may occur before headaches become common. Certain warning signs for headache exist which make the headache more likely to be associated with brain cancer. These are defined as \"abnormal neurological examination, headache worsened by Valsalva maneuver, headache causing awakening from sleep, new headache in the older population, progressively worsening headache, atypical headache features, or patients who do not fulfill the strict definition of migraine\". Other associated signs are headaches that are worse in the morning or that subside after vomiting.\nLocation-specific symptoms.\nThe brain is divided into lobes and each lobe or area has its own function. A tumour in any of these lobes may affect the area's performance. The symptoms experienced are often linked to the location of the tumour, but each person may experience something different.\nBehaviour changes.\nA person's personality may be altered due to the tumor damaging lobes of the brain. Since the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes control inhibition, emotions, mood, judgement, reasoning, and behavior, a tumor in those regions can cause inappropriate social behavior, temper tantrums, laughing at things which merit no laughter, and even psychological symptoms such as depression and anxiety. More research is needed into the effectiveness and safety of medication for depression in people with brain tumors.\nPersonality changes can have damaging effects such as unemployment, unstable relationships, and a lack of control.\nCause.\nA known cause of brain cancers is ionizing radiation. Approximately 4% of brain cancers in the general population are caused by CT-scan radiation. For brain cancers that follow a CT scan at lags of 2 years or more, it has been estimated that 40% are attributable to CT-scan radiation. The risk of brain cancer is dose dependent, with the relative risk increasing by 0.8 for each 100 gray of ionizing radiation received. At this dose, approximately 6391 people would have to be exposed to cause 1 case of brain cancer. Ionizing radiation to the head as part of treatment for other cancers is also a risk factor for developing brain cancer.\nMutations and deletions of tumor suppressor genes, such as P53, are thought to be the cause of some forms of brain tumor. Inherited conditions, such as Von Hippel\u2013Lindau disease, tuberous sclerosis, multiple endocrine neoplasia, and neurofibromatosis type 2 carry a high risk for the development of brain tumors. People with celiac disease have a slightly increased risk of developing brain tumors. Smoking may increase the risk, but evidence of this remains unclear.\nAlthough studies have not shown any link between cell-phone or mobile-phone radiation and the occurrence of brain tumors, the World Health Organization has classified mobile-phone radiation on the IARC scale into Group 2B \u2013 possibly carcinogenic.\nThe claim that cell-phone usage may cause brain cancer is likely based on epidemiological studies which observed a slight increase in glioma risk among heavy users of wireless phones. When those studies were conducted, GSM (2G) phones were in use. Modern, third-generation (3G) phones emit, on average, about 1% of the energy emitted by those GSM (2G) phones, and therefore the finding of an association between cell-phone usage and increased risk of brain cancer is not based upon current phone usage.\nPathophysiology.\nMeninges.\nHuman brains are surrounded by a system of connective tissue membranes called meninges that separate the brain from the skull. This three-layered covering is composed of (from the outside in) the dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater. The arachnoid and pia are physically connected and thus often considered as a single layer, the \"leptomeninges\". Between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater is the subarachnoid space which contains cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This fluid circulates in the narrow spaces between cells and through the cavities in the brain called ventricles, to support and protect the brain tissue. Blood vessels enter the central nervous system through the perivascular space above the pia mater. The cells in the blood vessel walls are joined tightly, forming the blood\u2013brain barrier which protects the brain from toxins that might enter through the blood.\nTumors of the meninges are meningiomas and are often benign. Though not technically a tumor of brain tissue, they are often considered brain tumors since they protrude into the space where the brain is, causing symptoms. Since they are usually slow-growing tumors, meningiomas can be quite large by the time symptoms appear.\nBrain matter.\nThe three largest divisions of the brain are the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and the brainstem. These areas are composed of two broad classes of cells: neurons and glia. These two cell types are equally numerous in the brain as a whole, although glial cells outnumber neurons roughly 4 to 1 in the cerebral cortex. Glia come in several types, which perform a number of critical functions, including structural support, metabolic support, insulation, and guidance of development. Primary tumors of the glial cells are called gliomas and often are malignant by the time they are diagnosed.\nThe thalamus and hypothalamus are major divisions of the diencephalon, with the pituitary gland and pineal gland attached at the bottom; tumors of the pituitary and pineal gland are often benign.\nThe brainstem lies between the large cerebral cortex and the spinal cord. It is divided into the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata.\nDiagnosis.\nThere are no specific signs or symptoms for brain cancer, but the presence of a combination of symptoms and the lack of alternative causes may indicate a brain tumor. A medical history aids in the diagnosis. Clinical and laboratory investigations will serve to exclude infections as the cause of the symptoms.\nBrain tumors, when compared to tumors in other areas of the body, pose a challenge for diagnosis. Commonly, radioactive tracers are uptaken in large volumes in tumors due to the high activity of tumor cells, allowing for radioactive imaging of the tumor. However, most of the brain is separated from the blood by the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB), a membrane that exerts a strict control over what substances are allowed to pass into the brain. Therefore, many tracers that may reach tumors in other areas of the body easily would be unable to reach brain tumors until there was a disruption of the BBB by the tumor. Disruption of the BBB is well imaged via MRI or CT scan, and is therefore regarded as the main diagnostic indicator for malignant gliomas, meningiomas, and brain metastases.\nImaging.\nMedical imaging plays a central role in the diagnosis of brain tumors. Early imaging methods\u00a0\u2013 invasive and sometimes dangerous\u00a0\u2013 such as pneumoencephalography and cerebral angiography have been replaced by non-invasive, high-resolution techniques, especially magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans. MRI with contrast enhancement is the preferred imaging test in the diagnosis of brain tumors. Glioblastomas usually enhance with contrast on T1 MRI weighted MRI imaging, and on T2 with FLAIR imaging showing hyperintense cerebral edema. Low grade gliomas are usually hypointense on T1 MRI, and hyperintense with T2 with FLAIR MRI. Meningiomas are usually homogenously enhanced with dural thickening on MRI.\nTreatment with radiation can lead to treatment induced changes in the brain, including radiation necrosis (death of brain tissue due to radiation treatments) visible on brain imaging and which can be difficult to differentiate from tumor recurrence.\nDifferent Types of MRI Scans.\nMagnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA)\u00a0\u2013 looks at the blood vessels in the brain. In the diagnosis of brain tumor, MRAs are typically carried out before surgery to help surgeons get a better understanding of the tumor vasculature. For example, a study was done where surgeons were able to separate benign brain tumors from malignant ones by analyzing the shapes of the blood vessels that were extracted from MRA. Although not required, some MRA may inject contrast agent, gadolinium, into the patient to get an enhanced image\nMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS)\u00a0\u2013 measures the metabolic changes or chemical changes inside the tumor. The most common MRS is proton spectroscopy with its frequency measured in parts per million (ppm). Gliomas or malignant brain tumors have different spectra from normal brain tissue in that they have greater choline levels and lower N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) signals. Using MRS in brain tumor diagnosis can help doctors identify the type of tumor and its aggressiveness. For example, benign brain tumors or meningioma have increased alanine levels. It can also help to distinguish brain tumors from scar tissues or dead tissues caused by previous radiation treatment, which does not have increased choline levels that brain tumors have, and from tumor-mimicking lesions such as abscesses or infarcts.\nPerfusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (pMRI)\u00a0\u2013 assess the blood volume and blood flow of different parts of the brain and brain tumors. pMRI requires the injection of contrast agent, usually gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA) into the veins in order to enhance the contrast. pMRI provides a cerebral blood volume map that shows the tumor vascularity and angiogenesis. Brain tumors would require a larger blood supply and thus, would show a high cerebral blood volume on the pMRI map. The vascular morphology and degree of angiogenesis from pMRI help to determine the grade and malignancy of brain tumors. For brain tumor diagnosis, pMRI is useful in determining the best site to perform biopsy and to help reduce sampling error. pMRI is also valuable for after treatment to determine if the abnormal area is a remaining tumor or a scar tissue. For patients that are undergoing anti-angiogenesis cancer therapy, pMRI can give the doctors a better sense of efficacy of the treatment by monitoring tumor cerebral blood volume.\nFunctional MRI (fMRI)\u00a0\u2013 measures blood flow changes in active parts of the brain while the patient is performing tasks and provides specific locations of the brain that are responsible for certain functions. Before performing a brain tumor surgery on patients, neurosurgeons would use fMRI to avoid damage to structures of the brain that correspond with important brain functions while resecting the tumor at the same time. Preoperative fMRI is important because it is often difficult to distinguish the anatomy near the tumor as it distorts its surrounding regions. Neurosurgeons would use fMRI to plan whether to perform a resection where tumor is surgically removed as much as possible, a biopsy where they take a surgical sampling amount to provide a diagnosis, or to not undergo surgery at all. For example, a neurosurgeon may be opposed to resecting a tumor near the motor cortex as that would affect the patient's movements. Without preoperative fMRI, the neurosurgeon would have to perform an awake-craniotomy where the patient would have to interact during open surgery to see if tumor removal would affect important brain functions.\nDiffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI)\u00a0\u2013 a form of MRI that measures random Brownian motion of water molecules along a magnetic field gradient. For brain tumor diagnosis, measurement of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in brain tumors allow doctors to categorize tumor type. Most brain tumors have higher ADC than normal brain tissues and doctors can match the observed ADC of the patient's brain tumor with a list of accepted ADC to identify tumor type. DWI is also useful for treatment and therapy purposes where changes in diffusion can be analyzed in response to drug, radiation, or gene therapy. Successful response results in apoptosis and increase in diffusion while failed treatment results in unchanged diffusion values.\nOther Types of Imaging Techniques.\nComputed Tomography (CT) Scan\u00a0\u2013 uses x-rays to take pictures from different angles and computer processing to combine the pictures into a 3D image. A CT scan usually serves as an alternative to MRI in cases where the patient cannot have an MRI due to claustrophobia or pacemaker. Compared to MRI, a CT scan shows a more detailed image of the bone structures near the tumor and can be used to measure the tumor's size. Like an MRI, a contrast dye may also be injected into the veins or ingested by mouth before a CT scan to better outline any tumors that may be present. CT scans use contrast materials that are iodine-based and barium sulfate compounds. The downside of using CT scans as opposed to MRI is that some brain tumors do not show up well on CT scans because some intra-axial masses are faint and resemble normal brain tissue. In some scenarios, brain tumors in CT scans may be mistaken for infarction, infection, and demyelination. To suspect that an intra-axial mass is a brain tumor instead of other possibilities, there must be unexplained calcifications in the brain, preservation of the cortex, and disproportionate mass effect.\nCT Angiography (CTA)\u00a0\u2013 provides information about the blood vessels in the brain using X-rays. A contrast agent is always required to be injected into the patient in the CT scanner. CTA serves as an alternative to MRA.\nPositron Emission Tomography (PET) Scan\u00a0\u2013 uses radiolabelled substances, such as FDG which taken up by cells that are actively dividing. Tumor cells are more actively dividing so they would absorb more of the radioactive substance. After injection, a scanner would be used to create an image of the radioactive areas in the brain. PET scans are used more often for high-grade tumors than for low-grade tumors. It is useful after treatment to help doctors determine if the abnormal area on an MRI image is a remaining tumor or a scar tissue. Scar tissues will not show up on PET scans while tumors would.\nPathology.\nMaximal safe surgical resection (to preserve as much neurological function as possible) and histologic examination of the tumor is also required to aid in the diagnosis. Cancer cells may have specific characteristics.\nAtypia: an indication of abnormality of a cell (which may be indicative of malignancy). Significance of the abnormality is highly dependent on context.\nNeoplasia: the (uncontrolled) division of cells that is characteristic of cancer.\nNecrosis: the (premature) death of cells, caused by external factors such as infection, toxin or trauma. Necrotic cells send the wrong chemical signals which prevent phagocytes from disposing of the dead cells, leading to a buildup of dead tissue, cell debris and toxins at or near the site of the necrotic cells\nLocal hypoxia, or the deprivation of adequate oxygen supply to certain areas of the brain, including within the tumor, as the tumor grows and recruits local blood vessels.\nClassification.\nTumors can be benign or malignant, can occur in different parts of the brain, and may be classified as primary or secondary. A primary tumor is one that has started in the brain, as opposed to a metastatic tumor, which is one that has spread to the brain from another area of the body. The incidence of metastatic tumors is approximately four times greater than primary tumors. Tumors may or may not be symptomatic: some tumors are discovered because the patient has symptoms, others show up incidentally on an imaging scan, or at an autopsy.\nGrading of the tumors of the central nervous system commonly occurs on a 4-point scale (I-IV) created by the World Health Organization in 1993. Grade I tumors are the least severe and commonly associated with long-term survival, with severity and prognosis worsening as the grade increases. Low-grade tumors are often benign, while higher grades are aggressively malignant and/or metastatic. Other grading scales do exist, many based upon the same criteria as the WHO scale and graded from I-IV.\nPrimary.\nThe most common primary brain tumors are:\nThese common tumors can also be organized according to tissue of origin as shown below:\nSecondary.\nSecondary tumors of the brain are metastatic and have spread to the brain from cancers originating in another organ. Metastatic spread is usually by the blood. The most common types of cancers that spread to the brain are lung cancer (accounting for over half of all cases), breast cancer, melanoma skin cancer, kidney cancer and colon cancer.\nBy behavior.\nBrain tumors can be cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). However, the definitions of malignant or benign neoplasms differ from those commonly used in other types of cancerous or non-cancerous neoplasms in the body.\nIn cancers elsewhere in the body, three malignant properties differentiate benign tumors from malignant forms of cancer: benign tumors are self-limited and do not invade or metastasize. Characteristics of malignant tumors include:\nBy genetics.\nIn 2016, the WHO restructured their classifications of some categories of gliomas to include distinct genetic mutations that have been useful in differentiating tumor types, prognoses, and treatment responses. Genetic mutations are typically detected via immunohistochemistry, a technique that visualizes the presence or absence of a targeted protein via staining.\nSpecific types.\nAnaplastic astrocytoma, Anaplastic oligodendroglioma, Astrocytoma, Central neurocytoma, Choroid plexus carcinoma, Choroid plexus papilloma, Choroid plexus tumor, Colloid cyst, Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour, Ependymal tumor, Fibrillary astrocytoma, Giant-cell glioblastoma, Glioblastoma, Gliomatosis cerebri, Gliosarcoma, Hemangiopericytoma, Medulloblastoma, Medulloepithelioma, Meningeal carcinomatosis, Neuroblastoma, Neurocytoma, Oligoastrocytoma, Oligodendroglioma, Optic nerve sheath meningioma, Pediatric ependymoma, Pilocytic astrocytoma, Pinealoblastoma, Pineocytoma, Pleomorphic anaplastic neuroblastoma, Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, Primary central nervous system lymphoma, Sphenoid wing meningioma, Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, Subependymoma, Trilateral retinoblastoma.\nTreatment.\nA medical team generally assesses the treatment options and presents them to the person affected and their family. Various types of treatment are available depending on tumor type and location, and may be combined to produce the best chances of survival:\nSurvival rates in primary brain tumors depend on the type of tumor, age, functional status of the patient, the extent of surgical removal and other factors specific to each case.\nStandard care for anaplastic oligodendrogliomas and anaplastic oligoastrocytomas is surgery followed by radiotherapy. One study found a survival benefit for the addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy after surgery, compared with radiotherapy alone.\nSurgery.\nSurgical resection of the greatest extent of contrast enhancing tumor possible (gross total resection) is associated with increased overall and progression free survival in those with glioblastoma. Gross total resection is often required in other brain tumors. Minimally invasive techniques are becoming the dominant trend in neurosurgical oncology. The main objective of surgery is to remove as many tumor cells as possible, with complete removal being the best outcome and cytoreduction (\"debulking\") of the tumor may otherwise be done. Due to the infiltrative nature of glioblastomas, total resection is usually unachievable and progression after surgery usually occurs, with progression occurring about 7 months after surgery.\nMany meningiomas, with the exception of some tumors located at the skull base, can be successfully removed surgically.\nMost pituitary adenomas can be removed surgically, often using a minimally invasive approach through the nasal cavity and skull base (trans-nasal, trans-sphenoidal approach). Large pituitary adenomas require a craniotomy (opening of the skull) for their removal. Radiotherapy, including stereotactic approaches, is reserved for inoperable cases.\nPostoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy are integral parts of the therapeutic standard for malignant tumors.\nMultiple metastatic tumors are generally treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy rather than surgery and the prognosis in such cases is determined by the primary tumor, and is generally poor.\nRadiation therapy.\nThe goal of radiation therapy is to kill tumor cells while leaving normal brain tissue unharmed. In standard external beam radiation therapy, multiple treatments of standard-dose \"fractions\" of radiation are applied to the brain. This process is repeated for a total of 10 to 30 treatments, depending on the type of tumor. This additional treatment provides some patients with improved outcomes and better survival rates.\nRadiosurgery is a treatment method that uses computerized calculations to focus radiation at the site of the tumor while minimizing the radiation dose to the surrounding brain. Radiosurgery may be an adjunct to other treatments, or it may represent the primary treatment technique for some tumors. Forms used include stereotactic radiosurgery, such as Gamma knife, Cyberknife or Novalis Tx radiosurgery.\nRadiotherapy is the most common treatment for secondary brain tumors. The amount of radiotherapy depends on the size of the area of the brain affected by cancer. Conventional external beam \"whole-brain radiotherapy treatment\" (WBRT) or \"whole-brain irradiation\" may be suggested if there is a risk that other secondary tumors will develop in the future. Stereotactic radiotherapy is usually recommended in cases involving fewer than three small secondary brain tumors. Radiotherapy may be used following, or in some cases in place of, resection of the tumor. Forms of radiotherapy used for brain cancer include external beam radiation therapy, the most common, and brachytherapy and proton therapy, the last especially used for children.\nPeople who receive stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) for the treatment of metastatic brain tumors have more than twice the risk of developing learning and memory problems than those treated with SRS alone. Results of a 2021 systematic review found that when using SRS as the initial treatment, survival or death related to brain metastasis was not greater than alone versus SRS with WBRT.\nPostoperative conventional daily radiotherapy improves survival for adults with good functional well-being and high grade glioma compared to no postoperative radiotherapy. Hypofractionated radiation therapy has similar efficacy for survival as compared to conventional radiotherapy, particularly for individuals aged 60 and older with glioblastoma.\nChemotherapy.\nPatients undergoing chemotherapy are administered drugs designed to kill tumor cells. Although chemotherapy may improve overall survival in patients with the most malignant primary brain tumors, it does so in only about 20 percent of patients. Chemotherapy is often used in young children instead of radiation, as radiation may have negative effects on the developing brain. The decision to prescribe this treatment is based on a patient's overall health, type of tumor, and extent of cancer. The toxicity and many side effects of the drugs, and the uncertain outcome of chemotherapy in brain tumors puts this treatment further down the line of treatment options with surgery and radiation therapy preferred.\nUCLA Neuro-Oncology publishes real-time survival data for patients with a diagnosis of glioblastoma. They are the only institution in the United States that displays how brain tumor patients are performing on current therapies. They also show a listing of chemotherapy agents used to treat high-grade glioma tumors.\nGenetic mutations have significant effects on the effectiveness of chemotherapy. Gliomas with IDH1 or IDH2 mutations respond better to chemotherapy than those without the mutation. Loss of chromosome arms 1p and 19q also indicate better response to chemoradiation.\nOther.\nA shunt may be used to relieve symptoms caused by intracranial pressure, by reducing the build-up of fluid (hydrocephalus) caused by the blockage of the free flow of cerebrospinal fluid.\nFor those with brain tumors, anti-seizure prophylactic (preventative) medications are not usually recommended. However, anti-epileptics are used in those with seizures.\nCerebral edema secondary to brain tumors is managed by corticosteroids. Dexamethasone is the preferred corticosteroid due to its long half-life and reduced effect on water retention (mineralcorticoid activity). Bevacizumab (an anti-VEGFA antibody) may improve cerebral edema in those that are unresponsive to steroids.\nPrognosis.\nThe prognosis of brain cancer depends on the type of cancer diagnosed. Medulloblastoma has a good prognosis with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgical resection while glioblastoma has a median survival of only 15 months even with aggressive chemoradiotherapy and surgery. Brainstem gliomas have the poorest prognosis of any form of brain cancer, with most patients dying within one year, even with therapy that typically consists of radiation to the tumor along with corticosteroids. However, one type, focal brainstem gliomas in children, seems open to exceptional prognosis and long-term survival has frequently been reported.\nPrognosis is also affected by presentation of genetic mutations. Certain mutations provide better prognosis than others. IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in gliomas, as well as deletion of chromosome arms 1p and 19q, generally indicate better prognosis. TP53, ATRX, EGFR, PTEN, and TERT mutations are also useful in determining prognosis.\nGlioblastoma.\nGlioblastoma is the most aggressive (grade 4) and most common form of a malignant primary brain tumor. Even when aggressive multimodality therapy consisting of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and surgical excision is used, median survival is only 15\u201318 months. Standard therapy for glioblastoma consists of maximal surgical resection of the tumor, followed by radiotherapy between two and four weeks after the surgical procedure to remove the cancer, then by chemotherapy, such as temozolomide. Most patients with glioblastoma take a corticosteroid, typically dexamethasone, during their illness to relieve symptoms. Experimental treatments include targeted therapy, gamma knife radiosurgery, boron neutron capture therapy, gene therapy, and chemowafer implants.\nOligodendrogliomas.\nOligodendrogliomas are incurable but slowly progressive malignant brain tumors. They can be treated with surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiotherapy or a combination. For some suspected low-grade (grade II) tumors, only a course of watchful waiting and symptomatic therapy is opted for. These tumors show co-deletions of the p and q arms of chromosome 1 and chromosome 19 respectively (1p19q co-deletion) and have been found to be especially chemosensitive with one report claiming them to be one of the most chemosensitive tumors. A median survival of up to 16.7 years has been reported for grade II oligodendrogliomas.\nAcoustic neuroma.\nAcoustic neuromas are non-cancerous tumors. They can be treated with surgery, radiation therapy, or observation. Early intervention with surgery or radiation is recommended to prevent progressive hearing loss.\nEpidemiology.\nThe incidence of brain tumors is higher in developed countries. This could be explained by undiagnosed tumor-related deaths in resource limited or lower income countries or by early deaths caused by other poverty-related causes that preempt a patient's life before tumors develop.\nThe incidence of CNS tumors in the United States, Israel, and the Nordic countries is relatively high, while Japan and Asian countries have a lower incidence.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States in 2015, approximately 166,039 people were living with brain or other central nervous system tumors. Over 2018, it was projected that there would be 23,880 new cases of brain tumors and 16,830 deaths in 2018 as a result, accounting for 1.4 percent of all cancers and 2.8 percent of all cancer deaths. Median age of diagnosis was 58 years old, while median age of death was 65. Diagnosis was slightly more common in males, at approximately 7.5 cases per 100 000 people, while females saw 2 fewer at 5.4. Deaths as a result of brain cancer were 5.3 per 100 000 for males, and 3.6 per 100 000 for females, making brain cancer the 10th leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Overall lifetime risk of developing brain cancer is approximated at 0.6 percent for men and women.\nUK.\nBrain, other CNS or intracranial tumors are the ninth most common cancer in the UK (around 10,600 people were diagnosed in 2013), and it is the eighth most common cause of cancer death (around 5,200 people died in 2012). White British patients with brain tumour are 30% more likely to die within a year of diagnosis than patients from other ethnicities. The reason for this is unknown.\nChildren.\nIn the United States more than 28,000 people under 20 are estimated to have a brain tumor. About 3,720 new cases of brain tumors are expected to be diagnosed in those under 15 in 2019. Higher rates were reported in 1985\u20131994 than in 1975\u20131983. There is some debate as to the reasons; one theory is that the trend is the result of improved diagnosis and reporting, since the jump occurred at the same time that MRIs became available widely, and there was no coincident jump in mortality. Central nervous system tumors make up 20\u201325 percent of cancers in children.\nThe average survival rate for all primary brain cancers in children is 74%. Brain cancer is the most common cancer in children under 19 and results in more deaths in this age group than leukemia. Younger people have worse prognoses.\nThe most common brain tumor types in children (0\u201314) are: pilocytic astrocytoma, malignant glioma, medulloblastoma, neuronal and mixed neuronal-glial tumors, and ependymoma.\nIn children under 2, about 70% of brain tumors are medulloblastomas, ependymomas, and low-grade gliomas. Less commonly, and seen usually in infants, are teratomas and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors. Germ cell tumors, including teratomas, make up just 3% of pediatric primary brain tumors, but the worldwide incidence varies significantly.\nIn the UK, 429 children aged 14 and under are diagnosed with a brain tumour on average each year, and 563 children and young people under the age of 19 are diagnosed.\nResearch.\nImmunotherapy.\nCancer immunotherapy is being actively studied. For malignant gliomas no therapy has been shown to improve life expectancy as of 2015.\nVesicular stomatitis virus.\nIn 2000, researchers used the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) to infect and kill cancer cells without affecting healthy cells.\nRetroviral replicating vectors.\nLed by Prof. Nori Kasahara, researchers from USC, who are now at UCLA, reported in 2001 the first successful example of applying the use of retroviral replicating vectors towards transducing cell lines derived from solid tumors. Building on this initial work, the researchers applied the technology to \"in vivo\" models of cancer and in 2005 reported a long-term survival benefit in an experimental brain tumor animal model. Subsequently, in preparation for human clinical trials, this technology was further developed by Tocagen (a pharmaceutical company primarily focused on brain cancer treatments) as a combination treatment (Toca 511 &amp; Toca FC). This has been under investigation since 2010 in a Phase I/II clinical trial for the potential treatment of recurrent high-grade glioma including glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma. No results have yet been published.\nNon-invasive detection.\nEfforts to detect and monitor development and treatment response of brain tumors by liquid biopsy from blood, cerebrospinal fluid or urine, are in the early stages of development.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A user schedules a job to run and then waits for a processing system to run it. Typically, a job is scheduled to run at a configured time of day or when an event occurs or when computer resources are available.\nHistory.\nThe term \"batch processing\" originates in the traditional classification of methods of production as job production (one-off production), batch production (production of a \"batch\" of multiple items at once, one stage at a time), and flow production (mass production, all stages in process at once).\nEarly history.\nEarly computers were capable of running only one program at a time. Each user had sole control of the machine for a scheduled period of time. They would arrive at the computer with program and data, often on punched paper cards and magnetic or paper tape, and would load their program, run and debug it, and carry off their output when done.\nAs computers became faster the setup and takedown time became a larger percentage of available computer time. Programs called \"monitors\", the forerunners of operating systems, were developed which could process a series, or \"batch\", of programs, often from magnetic tape prepared offline. The monitor would be loaded into the computer and run the first job of the batch. At the end of the job it would regain control and load and run the next until the batch was complete. Often the output of the batch would be written to magnetic tape and printed or punched offline. Examples of monitors were IBM's \"Fortran Monitor System\", SOS (Share Operating System), and finally IBSYS for IBM's 709x systems in 1960.\nThird-generation systems.\n capable of multiprogramming began to appear in the 1960s. Instead of running one batch job at a time, these systems can have multiple batch programs running at the same time in order to keep the system as busy as possible. One or more programs might be awaiting input, one actively running on the CPU, and others generating output. Instead of offline input and output, programs called spoolers read jobs from cards, disk, or remote terminals and place them in a job queue to be run. In order to prevent deadlocks the job scheduler needs to know each job's resource requirements\u2014memory, magnetic tapes, mountable disks, etc., so various scripting languages were developed to supply this information in a structured way. Probably the most well-known is IBM's \"Job Control Language\" (JCL). Job schedulers select jobs to run according to a variety of criteria, including priority, memory size, etc. Remote batch is a procedure for submitting batch jobs from remote terminals, often equipped with a punch card reader and a line printer. Sometimes asymmetric multiprocessing is used to spool batch input and output for one or more large computers using an attached smaller and less-expensive system, as in the IBM System/360 Attached Support Processor.\nLater history.\nThe first general purpose time sharing system, Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS), was compatible with batch processing. This facilitated transitioning from batch processing to interactive computing.\nFrom the late 1960s onwards, interactive computing such as via text-based computer terminal interfaces (as in Unix shells or read-eval-print loops), and later graphical user interfaces became common. Non-interactive computation, both one-off jobs such as compilation, and processing of multiple items in batches, became retrospectively referred to as \"batch processing\", and the term \"batch job\" (in early use often \"batch \"of\" jobs\") became common. Early use is particularly found at the University of Michigan, around the Michigan Terminal System (MTS).\nAlthough timesharing did exist, its use was not robust enough for corporate data processing; none of this was related to the earlier unit record equipment, which was human-operated.\nOngoing.\nNon-interactive computation remains pervasive in computing, both for general data processing and for system \"housekeeping\" tasks (using system software). A high-level program (executing multiple programs, with some additional \"glue\" logic) is today most often called a \"script\", and written in scripting languages, particularly shell scripts for system tasks; in IBM PC DOS and MS-DOS this is instead known as a batch file. That includes UNIX-based computers, Microsoft Windows, macOS (whose foundation is the BSD Unix kernel), and even smartphones. A running script, particularly one executed from an interactive login session, is often known as a job, but that term is used very ambiguously.\n\"There is no direct counterpart to z/OS batch processing in PC or UNIX systems. Batch jobs are typically executed at a scheduled time or on an as-needed basis. Perhaps the closest comparison is with processes run by an at or cron command in UNIX, although the differences are significant.\"\nModern systems.\nBatch applications are still critical in most organizations in large part because many common business processes are amenable to batch processing. While online systems can also function when manual intervention is not desired, they are not typically optimized to perform high-volume, repetitive tasks. Therefore, even new systems usually contain one or more batch applications for updating information at the end of the day, generating reports, printing documents, and other non-interactive tasks that must complete reliably within certain business deadlines.\nSome applications are amenable to flow processing, namely those that only need data from a single input at once (not totals, for instance): start the next step for each input as it completes the previous step. In this case flow processing lowers latency for individual inputs, allowing them to be completed without waiting for the entire batch to finish. However, many applications require data from all records, notably computations such as totals. In this case the entire batch must be completed before one has a usable result: partial results are not usable.\nModern batch applications make use of modern batch frameworks such as Jem The Bee, Spring Batch or implementations of JSR 352 written for Java, and other frameworks for other programming languages, to provide the fault tolerance and scalability required for high-volume processing. In order to ensure high-speed processing, batch applications are often integrated with grid computing solutions to partition a batch job over a large number of processors, although there are significant programming challenges in doing so. High volume batch processing places particularly heavy demands on system and application architectures as well. Architectures that feature strong input/output performance and vertical scalability, including modern mainframe computers, tend to provide better batch performance than alternatives.\nScripting languages became popular as they evolved along with batch processing.\nBatch window.\nA \"batch window\" is \"a period of less-intensive online activity\", when the computer system is able to run batch jobs without interference from, or with, interactive online systems.\nA bank's \"end-of-day (EOD)\" jobs require the concept of \"cutover\", where transaction and data are cut off for a particular day's batch activity (\"deposits after 3 PM will be processed the next day\").\nAs requirements for online systems uptime expanded to support globalization, the Internet, and other business needs, the batch window shrank and increasing emphasis was placed on techniques that would require online data to be available for a maximum amount of time.\nBatch size.\nThe \"batch size\" refers to the number of work units to be processed within one batch operation. Some examples are:\nNotable batch scheduling and execution environments.\nThe IBM mainframe z/OS operating system or platform has arguably the most highly refined and evolved set of batch processing facilities owing to its origins, long history, and continuing evolution. Today such systems commonly support hundreds or even thousands of concurrent online and batch tasks within a single operating system image. Technologies that aid concurrent batch and online processing include Job Control Language (JCL), scripting languages such as REXX, Job Entry Subsystem (JES2 and JES3), Workload Manager (WLM), Automatic Restart Manager (ARM), Resource Recovery Services (RRS), IBM Db2 data sharing, Parallel Sysplex, unique performance optimizations such as HiperDispatch, I/O channel architecture, and several others.\nThe Unix programs codice_1, codice_2, and codice_3 (today codice_3 is a variant of codice_2) allow for complex scheduling of jobs. Windows has a job scheduler. Most high-performance computing clusters use batch processing to maximize cluster usage.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Entertainment and created in 1969 by writers Joe Ruby and Ken Spears through their animated series, \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\", for Hanna-Barbera, which was later absorbed into Warner Bros. Animation in 2001. The series features four teenagers named Fred Jones, Daphne Blake, Velma Dinkley, and Shaggy Rogers, and their talking Great Dane named Scooby-Doo, who solve mysteries involving supposedly supernatural creatures through a series of antics and missteps, while traveling in a brightly colored van called the \"Mystery Machine\". The franchise has numerous shows, films, and specials.\n\"Scooby-Doo\" was originally broadcast on CBS from 1969 to 1976, when it moved to ABC. ABC aired various versions of \"Scooby-Doo\" until canceling it in 1986, and presented a spin-off featuring the characters as children called \"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\" from 1988 to 1991. Two \"Scooby-Doo\" reboots aired as part of Kids' WB on The WB and its successor The CW from 2002 to 2008. Further reboots aired on Cartoon Network from 2010 to 2018. Repeats of the various \"Scooby-Doo\" series are frequently broadcast on Cartoon Network's sister channel Boomerang in the United States and other countries. The most recent \"Scooby-Doo\" series, \"Scooby-Doo and Guess Who?\", premiered on June 27, 2019, as an original series on Boomerang's streaming service and later HBO Max.\nIn 2013, \"TV Guide\" ranked \"Scooby-Doo\" the fifth-greatest TV cartoon of all time.\nDevelopment.\nIn 1968, parent-run organizations, particularly Action for Children's Television (ACT), began protesting what they perceived as excessive violence in Saturday-morning cartoons. Most of these shows were Hanna-Barbera action cartoons such as \"Space Ghost\", \"The Herculoids\", and \"Birdman and the Galaxy Trio\", and virtually all of them were canceled by 1969 because of pressure from the parent groups. Members of these watch groups served as advisers to Hanna-Barbera and other animation studios to ensure that new programs would be safe for children.\nFred Silverman, an executive for daytime programming at CBS, was then looking for a show that would both revitalize his Saturday-morning line and please the watch groups. The result was \"The Archie Show\" from Filmation, based on Bob Montana's teenage humor comic book \"Archie\". Also successful were the musical numbers The Archies performed during each program (one of which, \"Sugar, Sugar\", was the most successful \"Billboard\" number-one hit of 1969). Eager to build upon this success, Silverman contacted producers William Hanna and Joseph Barbera about creating another show based on a teenage rock group, this time featuring teens who solved mysteries between gigs. Silverman envisioned the show as a cross between the popular \"I Love a Mystery\" radio serials of the 1940s and the Archie characters or the popular early 1960s television series \"The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis\".\nAfter attempting to develop his version of the show, called \"House of Mystery\", Barbera, who developed and sold Hanna-Barbera shows while Hanna produced them, passed the task along to story writers Joe Ruby and Ken Spears, as well as artist/character designer Iwao Takamoto. Their treatment, based in part on \"The Archie Show\", was titled \"Mysteries Five\" and featured five teenagers: Geoff, Mike, Kelly, Linda, and Linda's brother W.W., along with their bongo-playing dog, Too Much, who collectively formed the band Mysteries Five. When The Mysteries Five were not performing at gigs, they were out solving spooky mysteries involving ghosts, zombies, and other supernatural creatures. Ruby and Spears were unable to decide whether Too Much would be a large cowardly dog or a small feisty one. When the former was chosen, Ruby and Spears wrote Too Much as a Great Dane but revised the dog character to a large sheepdog (similar to the Archies' sheepdog, Hot Dog) just before their presentation to Silverman, as Ruby feared the character would be too similar to the comic strip character Marmaduke. Silverman rejected their initial pitch, and after consulting with Barbera on next steps, got Barbera's permission to go ahead with Too Much being a Great Dane instead of a sheepdog.\nDuring the design phase, lead character designer Takamoto consulted a studio colleague who was a breeder of Great Danes. After learning the characteristics of a prize-winning Great Dane from her, Takamoto proceeded to break most of the rules and designed Too Much with overly bowed legs, a double chin, and a sloped back, among other abnormalities.\nRuby and Spears' second pass at the show used \"Dobie Gillis\" as the template for the teenagers rather than \"Archie\". The treatment retained the dog Too Much, while reducing the number of teenagers to four, removing the Mike character and retaining Geoff, Kelly, Linda, and W.W. As their personalities were modified, so were the characters' names: Geoff became \"Ronnie\"\u2014later renamed \"Fred\" (at Silverman's behest), Kelly became \"Daphne\", Linda \"Velma\", and W.W. \"Shaggy\". The teens were now based on four teenage characters from \"The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis\": Dobie Gillis, Thalia Menninger, Zelda Gilroy and Maynard G. Krebs, respectively.\nThe revised show was re-pitched to Silverman, who liked the material but, disliking the title \"Mysteries Five\", decided to call the show \"Who's S-S-Scared?\" Silverman presented \"Who's S-S-Scared?\" to the CBS executives as the centerpiece for the upcoming 1969\u201370 season's Saturday-morning cartoon block. CBS president Frank Stanton felt that the presentation artwork was too scary for young viewers and, thinking the show would be the same, decided to pass on it.\nNow without a centerpiece for the upcoming season's programming, Silverman had Ruby, Spears, and the Hanna-Barbera staff revise the treatments and presentation materials to tone down the show and better reflect its comedy elements. The rock band element was dropped, and more attention was focused on Shaggy and Too Much. According to Ruby and Spears, Silverman was inspired by Frank Sinatra's scat \"doo-be-doo-be-doo\" at the end of his recording of \"Strangers in the Night\" on a red-eye flight to one of the development meetings, and decided to rename the dog \"Scooby-Doo\" and retitled the show \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\" The revised show was re-presented to CBS executives, who approved it for production.\nCBS years (1969\u201376).\n\"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\".\nThe first episode of \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\" \"What a Night for a Knight\" debuted on the CBS network Saturday, September 13, 1969, at 10:30 AM Eastern Time. The original voice cast featured Don Messick as Scooby-Doo, Casey Kasem as Shaggy, Frank Welker as Fred, actress Nicole Jaffe as Velma, and Indira Stefanianna as Daphne. Scooby's speech patterns closely resembled an earlier cartoon dog, Astro from \"The Jetsons\" (1962\u201363), also voiced by Messick. Seventeen episodes of \"Scooby-Doo Where Are You!\" were produced in 1969\u201370. The series theme song was written by David Mook and Ben Raleigh, and performed by Larry Marks.\nEach of these episodes features Scooby and the four teenage members of Mystery, Inc.\u2014Fred, Shaggy, Daphne, and Velma\u2014arriving at a location in the Mystery Machine, a van painted with psychedelic colors and flower power imagery. Encountering a purportedly supernatural monster terrorizing the local populace, such as a ghost, they decide to investigate. The kids split up to look for clues and suspects, while being chased at turns by the monster. Eventually, the kids come to realize the paranormal activity is actually an elaborate hoax, and\u2014often with the help of a Rube Goldberg-like trap designed by Fred\u2014they capture the creature suit-wearing villain and unmask him or her. Revealed usually as a flesh and blood crook who used the costume to cover up their crimes, the villain is arrested and taken to jail, often with the catchphrase \"if it weren't for those pesky/meddling kids\". A few times though, the \"villain\" turns out to be innocent, such as a haywire robot or the owner disguised to scare away thieves.\nScheduled opposite another teenage mystery-solving show, ABC's \"The Hardy Boys\", \"Scooby-Doo\" became a ratings success, with Nielsen ratings reporting that as many as 65% of Saturday-morning audiences were tuned in to CBS when \"Scooby-Doo\" was being broadcast. The show was renewed for a second season in 1970, for which eight episodes were produced. Seven of the second-season episodes featured chase sequences set to bubblegum pop songs recorded by Austin Roberts, who also re-recorded the theme song for this season. With Stefanianna Christopherson having married and retired from voice acting, Heather North assumed the role of Daphne, and she continued to voice the character until 1997.\nThe TV influences of \"I Love a Mystery\" and \"Dobie Gillis\" were apparent in the first episode. Of the similarities between the \"Scooby-Doo\" teens and the \"Dobie Gillis\" teens, the similarities between Shaggy and Maynard are the most noticeable; both characters share the same beatnik-style goatee, similar hairstyles, and demeanors. The core premise of \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\" was also similar to Enid Blyton's \"Famous Five\" books. Both series featured four youths with a dog, and the Famous Five stories often revolved around a mystery which invariably turned out not to be supernaturally based, but simply a ruse to disguise the villain's true intent.\nThe role of each character was strongly defined in the series: Fred is the leader and the determined detective, Velma is the intelligent analyst, Daphne is danger-prone, Shaggy is a coward more motivated by hunger than any desire to solve mysteries, and Scooby is similar to Shaggy, save for a Bob Hope-inspired tendency towards temporary bravery. Later versions of the show made slight changes to the characters' established roles, such as showing the Daphne in 1990s and 2000s \"Scooby-Doo\" productions as knowing many forms of karate and having the ability to defend herself, and reducing her tendency towards being kidnapped.\n\"Scooby-Doo\" itself influenced many other Saturday-morning cartoons of the 1970s. During that decade, Hanna-Barbera and its rivals produced several animated programs also featuring teenage detectives solving mysteries with a pet or mascot of some sort, including \"Josie and the Pussycats\" (1970\u201371), \"The Funky Phantom\" (1971\u201372), \"The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan\" (1972\u201373), \"Speed Buggy\" (1973\u201374), \"Goober and the Ghost Chasers\" (1973\u201374), \"Jabberjaw\" (1976\u201378), and \"Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels\" (1977\u201380).\n\"The New Scooby-Doo Movies\".\nIn the fall of 1972, new one-hour episodes under the title \"The New Scooby-Doo Movies\" were created; each episode featuring a real or fictitious guest star helping the gang solve mysteries, including characters from other Hanna-Barbera series such as \"Harlem Globetrotters\", \"Josie and the Pussycats\" and \"Speed Buggy\", the comic book characters Batman and Robin (adapted into their own Hanna-Barbera series, \"Super Friends\", a year later), and celebrities such as Sandy Duncan, The Addams Family, Cass Elliot, Phyllis Diller, Don Knotts and The Three Stooges. Hanna-Barbera musical director Hoyt Curtin composed a new theme song for this series, and Curtin's theme remained in use for much of \"Scooby-Doo's\" original broadcast run. After two seasons and 24 episodes of the \"New Movies\" format from 1972 to 1973, CBS began airing reruns of the original \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\" series until its option on the series expired in 1976.\nABC years (1976\u201391).\n\"The Scooby-Doo Show\" and \"Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics\".\nNow president of ABC, Fred Silverman made a deal with Hanna-Barbera to bring new episodes of \"Scooby-Doo\" to the ABC Saturday-morning lineup, where the show went through almost yearly lineup changes. For their 1976\u201377 season, 16 new episodes of Scooby-Doo were joined with a new Hanna-Barbera show, \"Dynomutt, Dog Wonder\", to create \"The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour\" (the show became \"The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Show\" when a bonus \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\" rerun was added to the package in November 1976). Joe Ruby and Ken Spears, now working for Silverman as supervisors of the ABC Saturday-morning programs, returned the program to its original \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\" format, with the addition of Scooby's dim-witted country cousin Scooby-Dum, voiced by Daws Butler, as a recurring character. The voice cast was held over from \"The New Scooby-Doo Movies\" save for Nicole Jaffe, who retired from acting in 1973. Pat Stevens took over her role as the voice of Velma.\nThen Joe Ruby and Ken Spears left again to start their own studio in 1977 as competition for Hanna-Barbera. They would remain away for the rest of the 1980s.\nFor the 1977\u201378 season, \"The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Show\" became the two-hour programming block \"Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics\" (1977\u201378) with the addition of \"Laff-a-Lympics\" and \"Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels\". In addition to eight new episodes of \"Scooby-Doo\" and reruns of the 1969 show, Scooby-Doo also appeared during the \"All-Star\" block's \"Laff-a-Lympics\" series, which featured 45 Hanna-Barbera characters competing in \"Battle of the Network Stars\"-esque parodies of Olympic sporting events. Scooby was seen as the team captain of the \"Laff-a-Lympics\" \"Scooby-Doobies\" team, which also featured Shaggy and Scooby-Dum among its members.\n\"Scooby's All-Star Laff-a-Lympics\" was retitled \"Scooby's All Stars\" for the 1978\u201379 season, reduced to 90 minutes when \"Dynomutt\" was spun off into its own half-hour and the 1969 reruns were dropped. \"Scooby's All-Stars\" continued broadcasting reruns of \"Scooby-Doo\" from 1976 and 1977, while new episodes of \"Scooby-Doo\" aired during a separate half-hour under the \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\" banner. After nine weeks, the separate \"Where Are You!\" broadcast was cancelled, and the remainder of the 16 new 1978 episodes debuted during the \"Scooby's All-Stars\" block. The 40 total \"Scooby-Doo\" episodes produced from 1976 to 1978 were later packaged together for syndication as \"The Scooby-Doo Show\", under which title they continue to air.\n\"Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo\".\nThe \"Scooby-Doo\" characters first appeared outside of their regular Saturday-morning format in \"Scooby Goes Hollywood\", an hour-long ABC television special aired in prime time on December 13, 1979. The special revolved around Shaggy and Scooby attempting to convince the network to move Scooby out of Saturday morning and into a prime-time series, and featured spoofs of then-current television series and films such as \"Happy Days\", \"Superman: The Movie\", \"Laverne &amp; Shirley\" and \"Charlie's Angels\".\nIn 1979, Scooby's tiny nephew Scrappy-Doo was added to both the series and the billing, in an attempt to boost \"Scooby-Doo\"'s slipping ratings. The 1979\u201380 episodes, aired under the new title \"Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo\" as an independent half-hour show, succeeded in regenerating interest in the show. Lennie Weinrib voiced Scrappy in the 1979\u201380 episodes, with Don Messick assuming the role thereafter. Marla Frumkin replaced Pat Stevens as the voice of Velma mid-season.\n\"Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo\" shorts.\nAs a result of \"Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo\"'s success, the entire show was overhauled in 1980 to focus more upon Scrappy-Doo. At this time, Scooby-Doo started to walk and run anthropomorphically on two feet more often, rather than on four like a normal dog as he did previously. Fred, Daphne, and Velma were dropped from the series, and the new \"Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo\" format now consisted of three seven-minute comedic adventures starring Scooby, Scrappy, and Shaggy instead of one half-hour mystery. Most of the supernatural villains in the seven-minute \"Scooby and Scrappy\" cartoons, who in previous \"Scooby\" series had been revealed to be human criminals in costume, were now real within the context of the series.\nThis version of \"Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo\" first aired from 1980 to 1982 as part of \"The Richie Rich/Scooby-Doo Show\", an hour-long program also featuring episodes of Hanna-Barbera's new \"Richie Rich\" cartoon, adapted from the Harvey Comics character. From 1982 to 1983, \"Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo\" were part of \"The Scooby-Doo/Scrappy-Doo/Puppy Hour\", a co-production with Ruby-Spears Productions which featured two \"Scooby and Scrappy\" shorts, a \"Scrappy and Yabba-Doo\" short featuring Scrappy-Doo and his Western deputy uncle Yabba-Doo, and \"The Puppy's New Adventures\", based on characters from a 1977 Ruby-Spears TV special. Despite the popularity, this was negatively hated by fans for how it dropped the mystery format and other main characters like Fred, Daphne, and Velma.\nBeginning in 1980, a half-hour of reruns from previous incarnations of \"Scooby-Doo\" were broadcast on ABC Saturday mornings in addition to first-run episodes. Airing under the titles \"Scooby-Doo Classics\", \"Scary Scooby Funnies\", \"The Best of Scooby-Doo\", and \"Scooby's Mystery Funhouse\", the rerun package remained on the air until the end of the 1986 season.\n\"The New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo Show\".\n\"Scooby-Doo\" was restored to a standalone half-hour in 1983 with \"The New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo Show\" in 1983, which comprised two 11-minute mysteries per episode in a format reminiscent of the original \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\" mysteries. Heather North returned to the voice cast as Daphne, who in this incarnation solved mysteries with Shaggy, Scooby, and Scrappy while working undercover as a reporter for a teen magazine.\nThis version of the show lasted for two seasons, with the second season airing under the title \"The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries\". The 1984\u201385 season episodes featured semi-regular appearances from Fred and Velma, with Frank Welker and Marla Frumkin resuming their respective roles for these episodes.\n\"The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo\".\n1985 saw the debut of \"The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo\", which featured Daphne, Shaggy, Scooby, Scrappy, and new characters Flim-Flam (voiced by Susan Blu) and Vincent Van Ghoul (based upon and voiced by Vincent Price) traveling the globe to capture \"thirteen of the most terrifying ghosts upon the face of the earth.\" The final first-run episode of \"The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo\" aired in December 1985, and after its reruns were removed from the ABC lineup the following March, no new \"Scooby\" series aired on the network for the next two years.\n\"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\".\nIn 1988, after ABC's initiative to shift its Saturday morning block toward preschoolers had spectacularly failed (in part, ABC alleged, due to the introduction of people meters that preschoolers were too young to operate), ABC launched an initiative to revive classic properties that older children and parents of younger children would recognize. Hanna-Barbera reincarnated the original \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\" cast as elementary school students (a common trope in 1980s children's TV) for a new series titled \"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\", which debuted on ABC in 1988. \"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\" was an irreverent re-imagining of the series, heavily inspired by the classic cartoons of Tex Avery and Bob Clampett, and eschewed the realistic aesthetic of the original \"Scooby\" series for a more \"Looney Tunes\"-like style, including an episode where Scooby-Doo's parents show up and reveal his real name to be \"Scoobert\". At the same time, the series returned to its original formula in that the group unmasked human villains in costume, as opposed to the supernatural monsters of the early to mid-1980s. The series also established \"Coolsville\" as the name of the gang's hometown; this setting was retained for several of the later \"Scooby\" productions. The retooled show was a success, remaining in production for four seasons and on ABC's lineup until 1991.\n\"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\" was developed and produced by Tom Ruegger, who had been the head story editor on \"Scooby-Doo\" since 1983. Following the first season of \"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\", Ruegger and much of his unit defected from Hanna-Barbera to Warner Bros. Animation to develop \"Steven Spielberg Presents Tiny Toon Adventures\" and later \"Animaniacs\", \"Pinky and the Brain\", and \"Freakazoid!\".\nKids' WB years (2002\u201308).\n\"What's New, Scooby-Doo?\".\nIn 2002, following the successes of the Cartoon Network reruns, the direct to video franchise, and the first feature film, \"Scooby-Doo\" returned to Saturday morning for the first time in a decade with \"What's New, Scooby-Doo?\", which aired on Kids' WB from 2002 until 2006. Produced by Warner Bros. Animation, the show follows the format of the original series but places it in the 21st century, featuring a heavy promotion of modern technology (computers, DVD, the Internet, cell phones) and culture.\nBeginning with this series, Frank Welker took over as Scooby's voice actor, while continuing to provide the voice of Fred as well. Casey Kasem returned as Shaggy, on the condition that the character be depicted as a vegetarian like Kasem himself. Grey DeLisle continued to voice Daphne, and former \"Facts of Life\" star Mindy Cohn voiced Velma. The series was produced by Chuck Sheetz, who had worked on \"The Simpsons\".\n\"Shaggy &amp; Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!\".\nIn September 2006 a new show entitled, \"Shaggy &amp; Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!\", debuted on The CW's Kids' WB Saturday-morning programming block. In the new premise, Shaggy inherits money and a mansion from an uncle, an inventor who has gone into hiding from villains trying to steal his secret invention. The villains, led by \"Dr. Phibes\" (based primarily upon Dr. Evil from the \"Austin Powers \"series, and named after Vincent Price's character from \"The Abominable Dr. Phibes\"), then use different schemes to try to get the invention from Shaggy and Scooby, who handle the plots alone. Fred, Daphne, and Velma are normally absent, but do make appearances at times to help. The characters were redesigned and the art style revised for the new series. Scott Menville voiced Shaggy in the series, with Casey Kasem appearing as the voice of Shaggy's Uncle Albert. \"Shaggy &amp; Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!\" ran for two seasons on The CW.\nCartoon Network and Boomerang years (2010\u201321).\n\"Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated\".\nThe next \"Scooby\" series, \"Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated\", premiered on Cartoon Network on April 5, 2010. The first \"Scooby\" series produced for cable television, \"Mystery Incorporated\" is a reboot of the franchise, re-establishing the characters' relationships, personalities, and locations, and expanding their world to feature their parents, high school, and neighbors. The series also borrowed pieces from many parts of \"Scooby-Doo's\" long history, as well as characters and elements of other Hanna-Barbera shows to form its back story and the bases of some of its episodes. Matthew Lillard was brought over from the live-action theatrical series as the new voice of Shaggy, while Welker, Cohn, and DeLisle continued in their respective roles. Patrick Warburton, Linda Cardellini, Lewis Black, Vivica A. Fox, Gary Cole, Udo Kier, Tim Matheson, Tia Carrere, and Kate Higgins were added as new semi-regular cast members. Casey Kasem appeared in a recurring role as Shaggy's father, one of his last roles before retiring due to declining health.\nThe series, while still following the basic mystery-solving format of its predecessors, was broadcast as a 52-chapter animated televised novel and included elements similar to live-action mystery/adventure shows such as \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" and \"Lost.\" An overarching mystery surrounding the gang's hometown of Crystal Cove, California became the series' main story arc, with pieces to the mystery unfolding episode by episode. Also featured were romantic entanglements and interpersonal conflict between the lead characters. The series ran for 52 episodes over two seasons, with a three-part finale airing across April 4 and 5, 2013\u2014exactly three years from the debut.\n\"Be Cool, Scooby-Doo!\".\nOn March 10, 2014, Cartoon Network announced several new series based on classic cartoons, including a new Scooby-Doo animated series titled \"Be Cool, Scooby-Doo!\". The show features the gang \"living it up\" the summer after the gang's senior year of high school. Along the way, they run into monsters and mayhem. The series premiered October 5, 2015 on Cartoon Network and concluded on March 18, 2018.\n\"Scooby-Doo and Guess Who?\".\nThe Scooby-Doo series \"Scooby-Doo and Guess Who?\" premiered on the Boomerang streaming service and app on June 27, 2019. It ran for two seasons, with the second half of the second season airing on HBO Max. The series features the Mystery Inc. gang teaming up with a variety of guest stars to solve mysteries. Guest stars included Halsey, Sia, Bill Nye, Mark Hamill, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Ricky Gervais, Kenan Thompson, and Chris Paul. The series also includes fictional guest stars, including Steve Urkel (played by Jaleel White), Batman (played by Kevin Conroy), Wonder Woman (played by Rachel Kimsey), the Flash, and Sherlock Holmes.\nStreaming era (2021\u2013present).\n\"Scooby-Doo and Guess Who?\".\nThe remaining eleven episodes of the second season were released through HBO Max on October 1, 2021. \n\"Velma\".\n\"Velma\" is an adult-oriented animated series that premiered on HBO Max on January 12, 2023. It ran for two seasons, and marked the first full original Scooby Doo related show on HBO Max since the previous series \"Guess Who?\" was picked up by it at the end of its run (originating on Boomerang). The series is an alternate reality prequel and spinoff to the main franchise, taking place before the formation of Mystery Inc., and does not include Scooby-Doo himself. Unlike in the previous series and films, the main characters (and main voice cast) in \"Velma\" are multi-racial.\nUntitled live-action series.\nOn April 29, 2024, Deadline reported that a live-action Scooby-Doo! series is in development by Berlanti Productions on Netflix, with Josh Appelbaum and\u00a0Scott Rosenberg writing; and Greg Berlanti, Sarah Schechter, Leigh London Redman, Andr\u00e9 Nemec, Jeff Pinkner, Jonathan Gabay and Midnight Radio's Adrienne Erickson executive producing. In March 2025, the series was confirmed to be in production.\nThe series will consist of eight episodes.\nPrincipal photography is expected to begin in early 2026.\nFilm and rerun history.\nTelevision films, reruns, and direct-to-video films.\nFrom 1987 to 1988, Hanna-Barbera Productions produced \"Hanna-Barbera Superstars 10\", a series of syndicated television films featuring their most popular characters, including Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound, The Flintstones, and The Jetsons. Scooby-Doo, Scrappy-Doo and Shaggy starred in three of these films: \"Scooby-Doo Meets the Boo Brothers\" (1987), \"Scooby-Doo and the Ghoul School\" (1988), and \"Scooby-Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf\" (1988). These three films took their tone from the early-1980s \"Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo\" entries, and featured the characters encountering actual monsters and ghosts rather than masqueraded people. Scooby-Doo and Shaggy later appeared as the narrators of the television film \"Arabian Nights\", originally broadcast by TBS in 1994, Don Messick's final outing as the original voice of Scooby-Doo.\nReruns of \"Scooby-Doo\" have been in syndication since 1980, and have also been shown on cable television networks such as TBS Superstation (until 1989) and USA Network (as part of the USA Cartoon Express from 1990 to 1994). In 1993, \"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\", having just recently ended its network run on ABC, began reruns on Cartoon Network. With Turner Broadcasting purchasing Hanna-Barbera in 1991, in 1994 the \"Scooby-Doo\" franchise became exclusive to the Turner networks: Cartoon Network, TBS Superstation, and TNT. Canadian network Teletoon began airing \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\" in 1997, with the other \"Scooby\" series soon following. When TBS and TNT ended their broadcasts of H-B cartoons in 1998, \"Scooby-Doo\" became the exclusive property of both Cartoon Network and sister station Boomerang.\nWith \"Scooby-Doo's\" restored popularity in reruns on Cartoon Network, Warner Bros. Animation and Hanna-Barbera (by then a subsidiary of Warner Bros. following the merger of Time Warner and Turner Entertainment in 1996) began producing one new \"Scooby-Doo\" direct-to-video film a year, beginning in 1998. These films featured a slightly older version of the original five-character cast from the \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\" days. The first four DTV entries were \"Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island\" (1998), \"Scooby-Doo! and the Witch's Ghost\" (1999), \"Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders\" (2000), and \"Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase\" (2001). Frank Welker was the only original voice cast member to return for these productions. Don Messick had died in 1997 and Casey Kasem, a strict vegetarian, relinquished the role of Shaggy after having to provide the voice for a 1995 Burger King commercial. Therefore, Scott Innes took over as both Scooby-Doo and Shaggy (Billy West voiced Shaggy in \"Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island\"). B.J. Ward took over as Velma, and Mary Kay Bergman voiced Daphne until her death in November 1999, and was replaced by Grey DeLisle.\nThese first four direct-to-video films differed from the original series format by placing the characters in plots with a darker tone and pitting them against actual supernatural forces. \"Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island\", featured the original 1969 gang, reunited after years of being apart, fighting voodoo-worshiping cat creatures in the Louisiana bayou. \"Scooby-Doo! and the Witch's Ghost\" featured an author (voice of Tim Curry) returning to his Massachusetts hometown with the gang, to find out that an event is being haunted by the author's dead ancestor Sarah, who was an actual witch. \"The Witch's Ghost\" introduced a goth rock band known as The Hex Girls, who became recurring characters in the \"Scooby-Doo\" franchise.\n\"Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase\" was the final production made by the Hanna-Barbera studio, which was absorbed into parent company Warner Bros. Animation following William Hanna's death in 2001. Warner Animation continued production of the direct-to-video series while also producing new \"Scooby-Doo\" series for television.\nThe direct-to-video productions continued to be produced concurrently with at least one entry per year through to 2023. Two of these entries, \"Scooby-Doo! and the Legend of the Vampire\" and \"Scooby-Doo! and the Monster of Mexico\" (both 2003) were produced in a retro-style reminiscent of the original series, and featured Heather North and Nicole Jaffe as the voices of Daphne and Velma, respectively. Later entries produced between 2004 and 2009 were done in the style of \"What's New, Scooby-Doo\", using that show's voice cast. Entries from 2010 on use the original 1969 designs and feature Matthew Lillard as the voice of Shaggy, the character Lillard portrayed in the live-action theatrical \"Scooby-Doo\" films. Two \"Scooby-Doo!\" movies were released in 2016, named \"Lego Scooby-Doo! Haunted Hollywood\" and \"\".\n\"Scooby-Doo!\" direct-to-video specials.\nBeginning in 2012, Warner Bros. Animation began producing direct-to-video special episodes in the style of the concurrently produced films for inclusion on \"Scooby-Doo\" compilation DVD sets otherwise including episodes from previous Scooby series. These include \"Scooby-Doo! Spooky Games\", included on the July 2012 release \"Scooby-Doo! Laff-A-Lympics: Spooky Games\", \"Scooby-Doo! Haunted Holidays\", from the October 2012 release \"Scooby-Doo! 13 Spooky Tales: Holiday Chills and Thrills\", and \"Scooby-Doo! and the Spooky Scarecrow\" and \"Scooby-Doo! Mecha Mutt Menace\", from the September 2013 DVD releases \"Scooby-Doo! 13 Spooky Tales: Run for Your 'Rife!\" and \"Scooby-Doo! 13 Spooky Tales: Ruh-Roh Robot!\". On May 13, 2014, another episode, \"Scooby-Doo! Ghastly Goals\" was released on the \"Scooby-Doo! 13 Spooky Tales: Field of Screams\" DVD. On May 5, 2015, \"Scooby-Doo! and the Beach Beastie\", the sixth direct-to-video special, was released on the \"Scooby-Doo! 13 Spooky Tales: Surf's Up Scooby-Doo\" DVD.\nThe direct-to-video series' 34th installment, \"Trick or Treat Scooby-Doo!\" (2022), made headlines for portraying Velma as a lesbian (by showing her \"crushing big time\" on a female guest character), which was in accordance with long-held fan speculation but had never previously been depicted.\nLive-action films.\nA feature-length live-action film version of \"Scooby-Doo\" was released by Warner Bros. Pictures on June 14, 2002. Directed by Raja Gosnell, the film starred Freddie Prinze Jr. as Fred, Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne, Matthew Lillard as Shaggy, and Linda Cardellini as Velma. Scooby-Doo, voiced by Neil Fanning, was created on-screen by computer-generated special effects. \"Scooby-Doo\" was a financially successful release, with a domestic box office gross of over US$130 million.\nA sequel, \"\", followed in March 2004 with the same cast and director. \"Scooby-Doo 2\" earned US$84 (\u20ac55.98) million at the U.S. box office. A third film was planned, but later scrapped following Warner Bros.' disappointment at the returns from \"Scooby-Doo 2\".\nIn addition, a live-action television film, \"Scooby-Doo! The Mystery Begins\", was released on DVD and simultaneously aired on Cartoon Network on September 13, 2009, the 40th anniversary of the series' debut. The film starred Nick Palatas as Shaggy, Robbie Amell as Fred, Kate Melton as Daphne, Hayley Kiyoko as Velma, and Frank Welker as the voice of Scooby-Doo. A second live-action TV movie, \"Scooby-Doo! Curse of the Lake Monster\", retained the same cast and aired on October 16, 2010, and a direct-to-video spin-off \"Daphne &amp; Velma\" in 2018. \"The Mystery Begins\" and \"Curse of the Lake Monster\" serve as prequels to the franchise, while \"Daphne and Velma\" serves as a spin-off/prequel.\nTheatrical animated film.\nIn 2013, Warner Bros. Pictures was developing a fully animated Scooby-Doo feature film with Warner Animation Group. Charles Roven and Richard Suckle, who produced the first two live-action films, were producing the animated film, and Matt Lieberman was writing the film. In 2014, Warner Bros. was restarting the film series with Randall Green writing a new movie. In 2015, Warner Bros. had Tony Cervone lined up to direct an animated film, with Allison Abbate as producer and Dan Povenmire as executive producer. Originally planned for a September 21, 2018 release, it was later pushed back to May 15, 2020, with Dax Shepard co-directing and co-writing. The Hollywood Reporter announced that Frank Welker will be reprising his voice role as Scooby, and that he will be joined by Will Forte and Gina Rodriguez voicing Shaggy and Velma, while Tracy Morgan will be voicing Captain Caveman, from the Hanna-Barbera series \"Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels\" and Deadline reported that Zac Efron and Amanda Seyfried will voice Fred and Daphne. In addition, Ken Jeong will be voicing Dynomutt, Dog Wonder from Hanna-Barbera series of the same name and Kiersey Clemons will voice Dee Dee Skyes, a character from Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels. Blue Falcon, from \"Dynomutt, Dog Wonder\" voiced by Mark Wahlberg and Dick Dastardly, from Hanna-Barbera's \"Wacky Races\", will be the film's main antagonist, voiced by Jason Isaacs. In March 2020, the film's theatrical release was delayed indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On April 22, 2020, Warner Bros. announced that due to movie theater closures the theatrical release for \"Scoob!\" had been cancelled, with the film released instead on Premium video on demand in the United States and Canada on May 15, 2020, the original date of release. In July 2020, Warner Bros. confirmed the film would still play in theaters in select countries with relaxed COVID-19 restrictions. The film subsequently received a secondary theatrical release in the United States beginning on May 21, 2021, in selected markets.\nComic books.\nGold Key Comics began publication of \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\" comic books in December 1969. The comics initially contained adaptations of episodes of the television show drawn by Phil DeLara, Jack Manning and Warren Tufts. The comic books later moved to all-original stories until ending with issue #30 in 1974. Several of these issues were written by Mark Evanier and drawn by Dan Spiegle. Charlton published \"Scooby\" comics, many drawn by Bill Williams, for 11 issues in 1975. From 1977 to 1979, Marvel Comics published nine issues of \"Scooby-Doo\", all written by Evanier and drawn by Spiegel. Harvey Comics published reprints of the Charlton comics, as well as a handful of special issues, between 1993 and 1994.\nIn 1995, Archie Comics began publishing a monthly \"Scooby-Doo\" comic book, the first year of which featured Scrappy-Doo among its cast. Evanier and Spiegel worked on three issues of the series, which ended after 21 issues in 1997 when Warner Bros.' DC Comics acquired the rights to publish comics based on Hanna-Barbera characters. DC's \"Scooby-Doo\" series continues publication to this day. In 2013, DC began a digital bi-monthly comic book titled \"Scooby-Doo Team-Up\", crossing over Mystery Inc. with other DC and Hanna-Barbera characters. Since then, the series has become a monthly comic book available in print.\nIn 2004, a limited series of a 100 comic books called \"Scooby-Doo! World of Mystery\" was released. In each issue, Mystery Inc. go from country to country solving mysteries. Each issue came with a pack of exclusive cards, with 350 in total able to be collected.\nIn 2016, DC launched a new monthly comic book entitled \"Scooby Apocalypse\", with the characters being reinvented in a story set in a post-apocalyptic world, where monsters roam the streets and Scooby and the gang must find a way to survive at all costs, while also trying to find a way to reverse the apocalypse.\nMerchandising.\nEarly \"Scooby-Doo\" merchandise included a 1973 Milton Bradley board game, decorated lunch boxes, iron-on transfers, coloring books, story books, records, underwear, and other such goods. When Scrappy-Doo was introduced to the series in 1979, he, Scooby, and Shaggy became the foci of much of the merchandising, including a 1983 Milton-Bradley \"Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo\" board game. The first \"Scooby-Doo\" video game appeared in arcades in 1986, and has been followed by a number of games for both home consoles and personal computers. \"Scooby-Doo \"multivitamins also debuted at this time, and have been manufactured by Bayer since 2001.\n\"Scooby-Doo\" merchandising tapered off during the late 1980s and early 1990s, but increased after the series' revival on Cartoon Network in 1995. Today, all manner of \"Scooby-Doo\"-branded products are available for purchase, including \"Scooby-Doo\" breakfast cereal, plush toys, action figures, car decorations, Barbie dolls from Mattel and much more. Real \"Scooby Snacks\" dog treats are produced by Del Monte Pet Products. Hasbro has created a number of \"Scooby\" board games, including a \"Scooby\"-themed edition of the popular mystery board game \"Clue\". In 2007, the Pressman Toy Corporation released the board game \"Scooby-Doo! Haunted House\". Beginning in 2001, a \"Scooby-Doo\" children's book series was authorized and published by Scholastic. These books, written by Suzanne Weyn, include original stories and adaptations of \"Scooby\" theatrical and direct-to-video features.\nFrom 1990 to 2002, Shaggy and Scooby-Doo appeared as characters in the \"Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera\" simulator ride at Universal Studios Florida. The ride was replaced in the early 2000s with a \"Jimmy Neutron\" attraction, and \"The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera\" instead became an attraction at several properties operated by Paramount Parks. Shaggy and Scooby-Doo are currently costumed characters at Universal Studios Florida, and can be seen driving the Mystery Machine around the park.\nIn 2001, \"Scooby-Doo in Stagefright\", a live stage play based upon the series, began touring across the world. A follow-up, \"Scooby-Doo and the Pirate Ghost\", followed in 2009.\nThe Mystery Machine has been used as the basis for many die-cast models and toys, such as from Hot Wheels.\nThe brand made $800 million in retail sales in 1999. In 2004, \"Scooby-Doo\" merchandise had generated $ in retail sales Licensed merchandise also sold $ in 2015, $ in 2016, and $ in 2017.\nReception and legacy.\nDuring its five-decade broadcast history, \"Scooby-Doo\" has received two Emmy nominations: a 1989 Daytime Emmy nomination for \"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\", and a 2003 Daytime Emmy nomination for \"What's New, Scooby-Doo\"'s Mindy Cohn in the \"Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program\" category. Science advocate Carl Sagan favorably compared the predominantly skeptic oriented formula to that of most television dealing with paranormal themes, and considered that an adult analogue to \"Scooby-Doo\" would be a great public service.\n\"Scooby-Doo\" has maintained a significant fan base, which has grown steadily since the 1990s due to the show's popularity among both young children and nostalgic adults who grew up with the series. Several television critics have stated that the show's mix of the comedy-adventure and horror genres was the reason for its widespread success. As Fred Silverman and the Hanna-Barbera staff had planned when they first began producing the series, \"Scooby-Doo\"'s ghosts, monsters and spooky locales tend more towards humor than horror, making them easily accessible to younger children. \"Overall, [\"Scooby-Doo\" is] just not a show that is going to overstimulate kids' emotions and tensions,\" offered American Center for Children and Media executive director David Kleeman in a 2002 interview. \"It creates just enough fun to make it fun without getting them worried or giving them nightmares.\nOlder teenagers and adults have admitted to enjoying \"Scooby-Doo\" because of presumed subversive themes which involve theories of drug use and sexuality, in particular that Shaggy is assumed to be a user of cannabis and Velma is assumed to be a lesbian. Such themes were pervasive enough in popular culture to find their way into Warner Bros.' initial \"Scooby-Doo\" feature film in 2002, though several of the scenes were edited before release to secure a family-friendly \"PG\" rating. Series creators Joe Ruby and Ken Spears reported that they \"took umbrage\" to the inclusion of such themes in the \"Scooby-Doo\" feature and other places, and denied intending their characters to be drug users in any way.\nLike many Hanna-Barbera shows, the early \"Scooby-Doo\" series have been criticized at times for their production values and storytelling. In 2002, Jamie Malanowski of \"The New York Times\" commented that \"[\"Scooby-Doo\"'s] mysteries are not very mysterious, and the humor is hardly humorous. As for the animation\u2014well, the drawings on your refrigerator may give it competition.\"\nBy the 2000s, \"Scooby-Doo\" had received recognition for its popularity by placing in a number of top cartoon or top cartoon character polls. The August 3, 2002, issue of \"TV Guide\" featured its list of the 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time, in which Scooby-Doo placed twenty-second. Scooby also ranked thirteenth in Animal Planet's list of the 50 Greatest TV Animals. For one year from 2004 to 2005, \"Scooby-Doo\" held the Guinness World Record for having the most episodes of any animated television series ever produced, a record previously held by and later returned to \"The Simpsons\". \"Scooby-Doo\" was published as holding this record in the 2006 edition of the \"Guinness Book of Records\".\nIn January 2009, entertainment website IGN named \"Scooby-Doo\" #24 on its list of the Top 100 Best Animated TV Shows. Writing in 2020, Christopher Orr of \"The Atlantic\" queried why the franchise had remained popular for several decades, concluding that it was primarily due to the many differing ways in which the relationship between the main characters could be interpreted or used as a metaphor.\nFive College folklore.\nA popular urban legend among Five College students holds that the characters on \"Scooby-Doo\" represent the five colleges. The legend has Velma representing Smith College and Daphne as Mount Holyoke College (or vice-versa), Fred as Amherst College, Shaggy as Hampshire College, and Scooby as UMass Amherst. Hanna-Barbera Productions, CBS executive Fred Silverman, and Mark Evanier, one of the show's writers, have stated that the legend is false. Moreover, \"Scooby-Doo\" creators Joe Ruby and Ken Spears have been explicit in the cartoon show being based on the radio program \"I Love a Mystery\" and the TV sitcom \"The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis\", with the four teenagers being based directly on characters from \"Dobie Gillis\". In addition, \"Scooby-Doo\" made its television debut in 1969, one year before Hampshire College opened.\nIn popular culture.\nAs with most popular franchises, \"Scooby-Doo\" has been parodied and has done parodies.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37290", "revid": "1175300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37290", "title": "Saint Casimir", "text": "Lithuanian and Polish saint (1458\u20131484)\nCasimir Jagiellon (; ; ; ; 3 October 1458 \u2013 4 March 1484) was a prince of the Kingdom of Poland and of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The second son of King Casimir IV Jagiellon, he was tutored by Johannes Longinus, a Polish chronicler, diplomat, and priest. After his elder brother Vladislaus was elected as King of Bohemia in 1471, Casimir became the heir apparent. At the age of 13, Casimir participated in the failed military campaign to install him as King of Hungary. He became known for his piety, devotion to God, and generosity towards the sick and poor. He became ill (most likely with tuberculosis) and died at the age of 25. He was buried in Vilnius Cathedral. His canonization was initiated by his brother King Sigismund I the Old in 1514 and the tradition holds that he was canonized in 1521. Saint Casimir the Prince is the patron saint of Poland, Lithuania and Lithuanian youth and the only saint with this name. \nVeneration of Casimir saw a resurgence in the 17th century when his feast day was confirmed by the pope in 1602 and the dedicated Chapel of Saint Casimir was completed in 1636. Casimir became a patron saint of Lithuania and Lithuanian youth. In Vilnius, his feast day is marked annually with Kaziuko mug\u0117 (a trade fair) held on the Sunday nearest to 4 March, the anniversary of his death. There are more than 50 churches named after Casimir in Lithuania and Poland, including Church of St. Casimir, Vilnius and St. Kazimierz Church, Warsaw, and more than 50 churches in Lithuanian and Polish diaspora communities in America. Women's congregation Sisters of Saint Casimir was established in 1908 and remains active in the United States.\nBiography.\nEarly life and education.\nA member of the Jagiellon dynasty, Casimir was born in Wawel Castle in Krak\u00f3w. Casimir was the third child and the second son of the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Casimir IV and Queen Elisabeth Habsburg of Austria. Elisabeth was a loving mother and took active interest in her children's upbringing. The Queen and the children often accompanied the King in his annual trips to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.\nCasimir was a polyglot and knew Lithuanian, Polish, German and Latin languages. From the age of nine, Casimir and his brother Vladislaus were educated by the Polish priest Fr. Jan D\u0142ugosz. The boys were taught Latin and German, law, history, rhetoric, and classical literature. D\u0142ugosz was a strict and conservative teacher who emphasized ethics, morality, and religious devotion. According to Stanis\u0142aw Orzechowski (1513\u20131566), the princes were subject to corporal punishment which was approved by their father. D\u0142ugosz noted Casimir's skills in oratory when he delivered speeches to greet his father returning to Poland in 1469 and Jakub Sienienski, the Bishop of Kujawy, in 1470.\nHungarian campaign.\nPrince Casimir's uncle Ladislaus the Posthumous, King of Hungary and Bohemia, died in 1457 at the age of 17, without leaving an heir. Casimir's father, King Casimir IV, subsequently advanced his claims to Hungary and Bohemia, but could not enforce them due to the Thirteen Years' War (1454\u201366). Instead, Hungarian nobles elected Matthias Corvinus and Bohemian nobles selected George of Pod\u011bbrady as their kings. George of Pod\u011bbrady died in March 1471. In May 1471, Vladislaus, eldest son of Casimir IV, was elected to the throne of Bohemia. However, a group of Catholic Bohemian nobles supported Matthias Corvinus instead of Vladislaus II. In turn, a group of Hungarian nobles conspired against Matthias Corvinus and invited the Polish king to overthrow him. King Casimir IV decided to install his son, Casimir, in Hungary.\nPoland amassed an army of 12,000 men, commanded by Piotr Dunin and Dziers\u0142aw of Rytwiany. Both King Casimir and Prince Casimir participated in the campaign. In October 1471, the Polish army crossed the Hungarian border and slowly marched towards Buda. Matthias Corvinus managed to win over the majority of the Hungarian nobles, including the main conspirator Archbishop J\u00e1nos Vit\u00e9z, and the Polish army did not receive the expected reinforcements. Only De\u00e1k, Per\u00e9ny and Rozgonyi families sent troops. Upon hearing that Corvinus' army of 16,000 men camped outside of Pest, the Polish army decided to retreat from Hatvan to Nitra. There the soldiers battled food shortages, spreading infectious diseases, and the upcoming winter. The Polish King also lacked funds to pay the mercenaries. As a result, the Polish army decreased by about a third. In December 1471, Prince Casimir, out of fear for his safety, was sent to Jihlava closer to the Polish border and that further eroded their soldiers' morale. Corvinus took Nitra and a one-year truce was completed in March 1472 in Buda. Prince Casimir returned to Krak\u00f3w to resume his studies with D\u0142ugosz.\nD\u0142ugosz remarked that Prince Casimir felt \"great sorrow and shame\" regarding the failure in Hungary. Polish propaganda, however, portrayed him as a savior, sent by divine providence, to protect the people from a godless tyrant (i.e. Matthias Corvinus) and marauding pagans (i.e. Muslim Ottoman Turks). Prince Casimir was also exposed to the cult of his uncle King W\u0142adys\u0142aw III of Poland who died in the 1444 Battle of Varna against the Ottomans. This led some researchers, including Jacob Caro, to conclude that the Hungarian campaign pushed Prince Casimir into religious life.\nLater life and death.\nAs his elder brother, Vladislaus II, ruled Bohemia, Prince Casimir became the heir apparent to the throne of Poland and Lithuania. Italian humanist writer Filippo Buonaccorsi (also known as Filip Callimachus) was hired to become Casimir's tutor in political matters, but his Renaissance views had less influence on Casimir than D\u0142ugosz. In 1474, the Italian merchant and traveler Ambrogio Contarini met with Prince Casimir and was impressed by his wisdom. Prince Casimir completed his formal education at age 16 and spent most of his time with his father. In 1476, Prince Casimir accompanied his father to Royal Prussia where he tried to resolve the conflict with the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;. In 1478 Seimas of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania demanded that King Casimir IV leave either Prince Casimir or Prince John I Albert in Lithuania as a regent. King Casimir IV feared separatist moods and refused, but after settling the conflict in Prussia, moved to Vilnius.\nBetween 1479 and 1484 his father spent most of his time in Vilnius attending to the affairs of Lithuania. In 1481, Mikhailo Olelkovich and his relatives planned to murder King Casimir and Prince Casimir during a hunt at a wedding of Feodor Ivanovich Belsky. The plan was discovered and Prince Casimir, perhaps fearing for his safety, was sent to Poland to act as vice-regent. Around the same time his father tried to arrange his marriage to Kunigunde of Austria, daughter of Emperor Frederick III. It is often said that Prince Casimir refused the match, preferring to remain celibate and sensing his approaching death. According to Maciej Miechowita, Prince Casimir developed tuberculosis. In May 1483, Prince Casimir joined his father in Vilnius. There, after the death of Andrzej Oporowski, Bishop and Vice-Chancellor of the Crown, Prince Casimir took over some of his duties in the chancellery. However, his health deteriorated while rumors about his piety and good deeds spread further. In February 1484, the Polish sejm in Lublin was aborted as King Casimir IV rushed back to Lithuania to be with his ill son. Prince Casimir died on 4 March 1484, in Grodno. His remains were interred in Vilnius Cathedral, where the dedicated Saint Casimir's Chapel was built in 1636.\nVeneration.\nPious life and attributed miracles.\nSurviving contemporary accounts described Prince Casimir as a young man of exceptional intellect and education, humility and politeness, who strove for justice and fairness. Early sources do not attest to his piety or devotion to God, but his inclination to religious life increased towards the end of his life. Later sources provide some stories of Casimir's religious life. Marcin Kromer (1512\u20131589) said Casimir refused his physician's advice to have sexual relations with women in hopes to cure his illness. Other accounts say Casimir contracted his lung disease after a particularly hard fast or that he could be found pre-dawn, kneeling by the church gates, waiting for a priest to open them. Zacharias Ferreri (1479\u20131524) wrote that Casimir composed a prayer in hexameter on Christ's incarnation but this text has not survived. Later, a copy of \"Omni die dic Mariae\" (\"Daily, Daily Sing to Mary\") was found in Casimir's coffin. The hymn became so strongly associated with Casimir that sometimes it is known as \"Hymn of St. Casimir\" and he is credited as its author. The lengthy hymn has an intricate meter and rhyme scheme (alternate acatalectic and catalectic trochaic dimeter with internal rhyme in the first and third verses (aa/b, cc/b)) and was most likely written by Bernard of Cluny.\nOne of the first miracles attributed to Casimir was his appearance before the Lithuanian army during the Siege of Polotsk in 1518. Casimir showed where Lithuanian troops could safely cross the Daugava River and relieve the city, besieged by the army of the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Ferreri's hagiography of 1521 mentions many miracles of Casimir are known but describes only one \u2013 a Lithuanian victory against the Russians. The description lacks specifics, such as date or location, but most likely refers to the Lithuanian victory in 1519 against Russian troops that raided the environs of Vilnius, and not the more popular story of the Siege of Polotsk.\nCanonization and official veneration.\nCasimir's official cult started spreading soon after his death. In 1501, Pope Alexander VI, citing Casimir's miracles as well as the splendor of the chapel where he was buried, granted a special indulgence to those who would pray in the chapel from one vespers to another during certain Catholic festivals, and would contribute to the upkeep of the chapel. In 1513, Andrzej Krzycki wrote a poem mentioning numerous wax votive offerings on Casimir's grave. In 1514, during the Fifth Council of the Lateran, Casimir's brother Sigismund I the Old petitioned the pope to canonize Casimir. After repeated requests, in November 1517, Pope Leo X appointed a three-bishop commission and later sent his legate Zacharias Ferreri to investigate. He arrived at Vilnius in September 1520 and completed his work in about two months. His findings, the first short hagiography of Casimir, was published in 1521 in Krak\u00f3w as \"Vita Beati Casimiri Confessoris\". The canonization was all but certain but Pope Leo X died in December 1521. Research of Zenonas Ivinskis and Paulius Rabikauskas showed that there is no documentary proof that he issued a papal bull canonizing Casimir but many important documents were lost during the Sack of Rome (1527). The Protestant Reformation attacked the cult of saints and there were no new canonizations between 1523 and 1588. However, Casimir was included in the first \"Roman Martyrology,\" published in 1583.\nThe cause of Casimir's cult was taken up by the new Bishop of Vilnius Benedykt Woyna (appointed in 1600). He sent canon Gregorius Swiecicki to Rome with a letter from King Sigismund III Vasa requesting to add the feast of Casimir to the Roman Breviary and Roman Missal. The Sacred Congregation of Rites refused the request but on 7 November 1602 Pope Clement VIII issued a papal brief \"Quae ad sanctorum\" which authorized his feast \"sub duplici ritu\" on 4 March but only in Poland and Lithuania. The brief also mentioned that Casimir was added to the ranks of saints by Pope Leo X. In the absence of any earlier known papal document explicitly mentioning Casimir as saint, the brief is often cited as Casimir's canonization. Swiecicki returned to Vilnius with the papal brief and red velvet labarum with the image of Saint Casimir. The city organized a large three-day festival on 10\u201312 May 1604 to properly accept the papal flag. On the third day, the cornerstone was laid for the new Church of St. Casimir. The coffin of Casimir was taken out of the crypt and elevated to the altar. Swiecicki testified that when the coffin was opened in August 1604 a wonderful smell filled the cathedral for three days.\nIn 1607 and 1613, Bishop Woyna declared Casimir patron saint of Lithuania (\"Patronus principalis Lithuaniae\"). The issue of a universal Casimir's feast was not forgotten and in 1620 Bishop Eustachy Wo\u0142\u0142owicz petitioned Pope Paul V to add Casimir to the Roman Breviary and Roman Missal. This time the Sacred Congregation of Rites granted the request in March 1621 and added his feast \"sub ritu semiduplici\". In March 1636, Pope Urban VIII allowed the celebration of the feast of Casimir with an octave (\"duplex cum octava\") in the Diocese of Vilnius and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. That is equivalent of proclaiming Casimir as the patron saint of Lithuania. On 28 September 1652, Pope Innocent X allowed a fest of transfer of relics of Casimir on a Sunday following the Assumption of Mary. On 11 June 1948, when many Lithuanians were displaced war refugees, Pope Pius XII named Casimir the special patron of Lithuanian youth.\nIconography.\nSaint Casimir's painting in Vilnius Cathedral is considered to be miraculous. The painting, probably completed around 1520, depicts the saint with two right hands. According to a legend, the painter attempted to redraw the hand in a different place and paint over the old hand, but the old hand miraculously reappeared. More conventional explanations claim that three-handed Casimir was the original intent of the painter to emphasize the exceptional generosity of Casimir (\"But when you give to someone in need, don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.\" ) or that the old hand bled through a coat of new paint (similar to a palimpsest). Around 1636 the painting was covered in gilded silver clothing (\"riza\").\nCasimir's iconography usually follows the three-handed painting. He is usually depicted as a young man in long red robe lined with stoat fur. Sometimes he wears a red cap of the Grand Duke of Lithuania, but other times, to emphasize his devotion to spiritual life, the cap is placed near Casimir. Almost always he holds a lily, a symbol of virginity, innocence, and purity. He might also hold a cross, a rosary, or a book with words from \"Omni die dic Mariae\" (Daily, Daily Sing to Mary). The towns of Kv\u0117darna and Nemunaitis in Lithuania have Saint Casimir depicted on their coat of arms.\nPhysical remains and relics.\nCasimir was buried in the crypt under the Royal Chapel of Vilnius Cathedral (present-day Wo\u0142\u0142owicz Chapel to the left from the main entrance), constructed by his father in the Gothic style in 1474. In 1604, the coffin was elevated from the crypt to the altar and in 1636 moved to the dedicated Chapel of Saint Casimir. The present-day sarcophagus was made in 1747 under the last will of Bishop of Warmia Christopher Johan Szembek (1680\u20131740). It is made of linden wood and covered with silver plates; its corners are decorated with gilded eagles. The sarcophagus was removed from the cathedral on three occasions. In 1655, before the Battle of Vilnius during the Deluge, the relics were removed most likely by Jerzy Bia\u0142\u0142ozor and hid by Cyprian Pawe\u0142 Brzostowski and later by the Sapiehas in the Ruzhany Palace. They were returned to the devastated chapel in 1663. The relics were removed for a short time in 1702 during the Battle of Vilnius of the Great Northern War. In October 1952, the relics were quietly moved to the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul by the order of Soviet authorities. The cathedral was turned into an art gallery. The relics returned to their place in 1989 when the cathedral was reconsecrated.\nAfter the rediscovery of the Catacombs of Rome in 1578, the cult of relics spread throughout Europe &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt; and the trend did not skip Casimir. The coffin of Casimir was opened in early 1602 and in August 1604. At the time, canon Gregorius Swiecicki testified that despite humidity the body was intact. But in 1667 there were only bones left; they were inventoried and placed into six cloth bags. Surviving written records indicate that the coffin was opened in 1664, 1667, 1677, 1690, 1736, 1838, 1878 (twice), and 1922. There are several recorded instances when Casimir's relics were gifted to prominent figures and societies: to musicians' confraternity at San Giorgio Maggiore, Naples in early 1650s, to King John III Sobieski and Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany in October 1677, to the Sodality of Our Lady of the Jesuit academy in Mechelen and the Order of Malta in October 1690, to Queen Maria Josepha of Austria in February 1736, to Cistercian abbot Szt\u00e1rek Lajos of Cik\u00e1dor Abbey in 1860. Many more relics of Casimir can be found in local churches. In particular, in 1838, two teeth and ten unspecified bones were removed from the coffin; the bones were cut into small pieces and distributed among various churches. In 1922, the bones were wrapped in a new cloth and the old cloth was distributed as a relic. It was the last time that a relic of Casimir (one tooth for the Church of St. Casimir) was taken.\nDedications.\nIn his 1970 monograph priest Florijonas Neviera (Florian Niewiero, 1896\u20131976) counted churches named after Casimir. He found 12 churches in Lithuania (as of 1940), 48 churches and 5 chapels in Poland, 23 Lithuanian and 36 Polish churches in United States (as of 1964), five churches in Canada (Montreal, Winnipeg, Toronto, Portneuf, and Ripon), two churches in United Kingdom (London and Manchester), and two churches in Belarus (Vselyub and Lepiel). The women's congregation Sisters of Saint Casimir was established in 1908 by Maria Kaupas and is active in the United States. In 1945, the College of Saint Casimir was established in Rome to educate Lithuanian priests who fled west after World War II.\nWhile the devotion to Casimir is most prevalent in Lithuania and Poland and their diaspora communities, his cult can be found in other countries as well. In the 17th century, at least two societies of Saint Casimir were active in Mechelen and Antwerp (now Belgium). In the 17th century, Casimir's cult also spread in Italy, particularly Florence, Palermo, Naples; his cult in Rome was more associated with Polish dignitaries and \u00e9migr\u00e9s. Musical performances were organized in Rome in 1675 (words by Sebastiano Lazzarini, music by Francesco Beretta, performed at Santo Spirito in Sassia) and in 1678 (words by Ottavio Santacroce, music probably by Giovanni Bicilli, performed at Santa Maria in Vallicella on the occasion of the visit by Micha\u0142 Kazimierz Radziwi\u0142\u0142 and his wife Katarzyna Sobieska), and in Florence in 1706 (words possibly by Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni, music by Alessandro Scarlatti). In Palermo, Pietro Novelli was commissioned painting \"Coronation of Saint Casimir\" (l'Incoronazione di s. Casimiro) for the altar of Chiesa di San Nicola da Tolentino (now held at the Galleria Regionale della Sicilia).\nThe settlements of Saint-Casimir in Canada (founded 1836) and San Casimiro in Venezuela (founded 1785) are named after him. Sculptures of Casimir, among other canonized royals, can be found in San Ferdinando, Livorno, Italy and Metropolitan Cathedral, Mexico City. Stained glass windows with Casimir can be found at the Cathedral Basilica of St. Joseph in San Jose, California, and at the Church of St. Peter in Chevaign\u00e9, France. Since 1846, there is a nursing home in Paris named \"Maison Saint-Casimir\". It was created by the Polish community of France and is run since its opening by Polish nuns Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

We can put a topology on formula_8 by defining the collection of closed sets to be\nformula_9\nThis topology is called the Zariski topology.\nA basis for the Zariski topology can be constructed as follows: For formula_10, define formula_11 to be the set of prime ideals of formula_1 not containing formula_13. Then each formula_11 is an open subset of formula_8, and formula_16 is a basis for the Zariski topology.\nformula_8 is a compact space, but almost never Hausdorff: In fact, the maximal ideals in formula_1 are precisely the closed points in this topology. By the same reasoning, formula_8 is not, in general, a T1 space. However, formula_8 is always a Kolmogorov space (satisfies the T0 axiom); it is also a spectral space.\nSheaves and schemes.\nGiven the space formula_21 with the Zariski topology, the structure sheaf formula_22 is defined on the distinguished open subsets formula_11 by setting formula_24 the localization of formula_1 by the powers of formula_13. It can be shown that this defines a B-sheaf and therefore that it defines a sheaf. In more detail, the distinguished open subsets are a basis of the Zariski topology, so for an arbitrary open set formula_27, written as the union of formula_28, we set formula_29 where formula_30 denotes the inverse limit with respect to the natural ring homomorphisms formula_31 One may check that this presheaf is a sheaf, so formula_8 is a ringed space. Any ringed space isomorphic to one of this form is called an affine scheme. General schemes are obtained by gluing affine schemes together.\nSimilarly, for a module formula_33 over the ring formula_1, we may define a sheaf formula_35 on formula_8. On the distinguished open subsets set formula_37 using the localization of a module. As above, this construction extends to a presheaf on all open subsets of formula_8 and satisfies the gluing axiom. A sheaf of this form is called a quasicoherent sheaf.\nIf formula_39 is a point in formula_8, that is, a prime ideal, then the stalk of the structure sheaf at formula_39 equals the localization of formula_1 at the ideal formula_39, which is generally denoted formula_44, and this is a local ring. Consequently, formula_8 is a locally ringed space.\nIf formula_1 is an integral domain, with field of fractions formula_47, then we can describe the ring formula_48 more concretely as follows. We say that an element formula_13 in formula_47 is regular at a point formula_39 in formula_52 if it can be represented as a fraction formula_53 with formula_54. Note that this agrees with the notion of a regular function in algebraic geometry. Using this definition, we can describe formula_48 as precisely the set of elements of formula_47 that are regular at every point formula_39 in formula_27.\nFunctorial perspective.\nIt is useful to use the language of category theory and observe that formula_59 is a functor. Every ring homomorphism formula_60 induces a continuous map formula_61 (since the preimage of any prime ideal in formula_62 is a prime ideal in formula_1). In this way, formula_59 can be seen as a contravariant functor from the category of commutative rings to the category of topological spaces. Moreover, for every prime formula_39 the homomorphism formula_13 descends to homomorphisms\nformula_67\nof local rings. Thus formula_59 even defines a contravariant functor from the category of commutative rings to the category of locally ringed spaces. In fact it is the universal such functor, and hence can be used to define the functor formula_59 up to natural isomorphism.\nThe functor formula_59 yields a contravariant equivalence between the category of commutative rings and the category of affine schemes; each of these categories is often thought of as the opposite category of the other.\nMotivation from algebraic geometry.\nFollowing on from the example, in algebraic geometry one studies \"algebraic sets\", i.e. subsets of formula_71 (where formula_47 is an algebraically closed field) that are defined as the common zeros of a set of polynomials in formula_73 variables. If formula_74 is such an algebraic set, one considers the commutative ring formula_1 of all polynomial functions formula_76. The \"maximal ideals\" of formula_1 correspond to the points of formula_74 (because formula_47 is algebraically closed), and the \"prime ideals\" of formula_1 correspond to the \"irreducible subvarieties\" of formula_74 (an algebraic set is called irreducible if it cannot be written as the union of two proper algebraic subsets).\nThe spectrum of formula_1 therefore consists of the points of formula_74 together with elements for all irreducible subvarieties of formula_74. The points of formula_74 are closed in the spectrum, while the elements corresponding to subvarieties have a closure consisting of all their points and subvarieties. If one only considers the points of formula_74, i.e. the maximal ideals in formula_1, then the Zariski topology defined above coincides with the Zariski topology defined on algebraic sets (which has precisely the algebraic subsets as closed sets). Specifically, the maximal ideals in formula_1, i.e. formula_89, together with the Zariski topology, is homeomorphic to formula_74 also with the Zariski topology.\nOne can thus view the topological space formula_8 as an \"enrichment\" of the topological space formula_74 (with Zariski topology): for every irreducible subvariety of formula_74, one additional non-closed point has been introduced, and this point \"keeps track\" of the corresponding irreducible subvariety. One thinks of this point as the generic point for the irreducible subvariety. Furthermore, the structure sheaf on formula_8 and the sheaf of polynomial functions on formula_74 are essentially identical. By studying spectra of polynomial rings instead of algebraic sets with the Zariski topology, one can generalize the concepts of algebraic geometry to non-algebraically closed fields and beyond, eventually arriving at the language of schemes.\nNon-affine examples.\nHere are some examples of schemes that are not affine schemes. They are constructed from gluing affine schemes together.\nNon-Zariski topologies on a prime spectrum.\nSome authors (notably M. Hochster) consider topologies on prime spectra other than the Zariski topology.\nFirst, there is the notion of constructible topology: given a ring \"A\", the subsets of formula_124 of the form formula_125 satisfy the axioms for closed sets in a topological space. This topology on formula_124 is called the constructible topology.\nIn , Hochster considers what he calls the patch topology on a prime spectrum. By definition, the patch topology is the smallest topology in which the sets of the forms formula_127 and formula_128 are closed.\nGlobal or relative Spec.\nThere is a relative version of the functor formula_59 called global formula_59, or relative formula_59. If formula_62 is a scheme, then relative formula_59 is denoted by formula_134 or formula_135. If formula_62 is clear from the context, then relative Spec may be denoted by formula_137 or formula_138. For a scheme formula_62 and a quasi-coherent sheaf of formula_140-algebras formula_141, there is a scheme formula_142 and a morphism formula_143 such that for every open affine formula_144, there is an isomorphism formula_145, and such that for open affines formula_146, the inclusion formula_147 is induced by the restriction map formula_148. That is, as ring homomorphisms induce opposite maps of spectra, the restriction maps of a sheaf of algebras induce the inclusion maps of the spectra that make up the Spec of the sheaf.\nGlobal Spec has a universal property similar to the universal property for ordinary Spec. More precisely, just as Spec and the global section functor are contravariant right adjoints between the category of commutative rings and schemes, global Spec and the direct image functor for the structure map are contravariant right adjoints between the category of commutative formula_140-algebras and schemes over formula_62. In formulas,\nformula_151\nwhere formula_152 is a morphism of schemes.\nExample of a relative Spec.\nThe relative spec is the correct tool for parameterizing the family of lines through the origin of formula_153 over formula_154 Consider the sheaf of algebras formula_155 and let formula_156 be a sheaf of ideals of formula_157 Then the relative spec formula_158 parameterizes the desired family. In fact, the fiber over formula_159 is the line through the origin of formula_160 containing the point formula_161 Assuming formula_162 the fiber can be computed by looking at the composition of pullback diagrams\nformula_163\nwhere the composition of the bottom arrows\nformula_164\ngives the line containing the point formula_165 and the origin. This example can be generalized to parameterize the family of lines through the origin of formula_166 over formula_167 by letting formula_168 and formula_169\nRepresentation theory perspective.\nFrom the perspective of representation theory, a prime ideal \"I\" corresponds to a module \"R\"/\"I\", and the spectrum of a ring corresponds to irreducible cyclic representations of \"R\", while more general subvarieties correspond to possibly reducible representations that need not be cyclic. Recall that abstractly, the representation theory of a group is the study of modules over its group algebra.\nThe connection to representation theory is clearer if one considers the polynomial ring formula_170 or, without a basis, formula_171 As the latter formulation makes clear, a polynomial ring is the monoid algebra over a vector space, and writing in terms of formula_172 corresponds to choosing a basis for the vector space. Then an ideal \"I,\" or equivalently a module formula_173 is a cyclic representation of \"R\" (cyclic meaning generated by 1 element as an \"R\"-module; this generalizes 1-dimensional representations).\nIn the case that the field is algebraically closed (say, the complex numbers), every maximal ideal corresponds to a point in \"n\"-space, by the Nullstellensatz (the maximal ideal generated by formula_174 corresponds to the point formula_175). These representations of formula_176 are then parametrized by the dual space formula_177 the covector being given by sending each formula_172 to the corresponding formula_179. Thus a representation of formula_71 (\"K\"-linear maps formula_181) is given by a set of \"n\" numbers, or equivalently a covector formula_182\nThus, points in \"n\"-space, thought of as the max spec of formula_183 correspond precisely to 1-dimensional representations of \"R\", while finite sets of points correspond to finite-dimensional representations (which are reducible, corresponding geometrically to being a union, and algebraically to not being a prime ideal). The non-maximal ideals then correspond to \"infinite\"-dimensional representations.\nFunctional analysis perspective.\nThe term \"spectrum\" comes from the use in operator theory.\nGiven a linear operator \"T\" on a finite-dimensional vector space \"V\", one can consider the vector space with operator as a module over the polynomial ring in one variable \"R\" = \"K\"[\"T\"], as in the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain. Then the spectrum of \"K\"[\"T\"] (as a ring) equals the spectrum of \"T\" (as an operator).\nFurther, the geometric structure of the spectrum of the ring (equivalently, the algebraic structure of the module) captures the behavior of the spectrum of the operator, such as algebraic multiplicity and geometric multiplicity. For instance, for the 2\u00d72 identity matrix has corresponding module:\nformula_184\nthe 2\u00d72 zero matrix has module\nformula_185\nshowing geometric multiplicity 2 for the zero eigenvalue,\nwhile a non-trivial 2\u00d72 nilpotent matrix has module\nformula_186\nshowing algebraic multiplicity 2 but geometric multiplicity 1.\nIn more detail:\nGeneralizations.\nThe spectrum can be generalized from rings to C*-algebras in operator theory, yielding the notion of the spectrum of a C*-algebra. Notably, for a Hausdorff space, the algebra of scalars (the bounded continuous functions on the space, being analogous to regular functions) is a \"commutative\" C*-algebra, with the space being recovered as a topological space from formula_187 of the algebra of scalars, indeed functorially so; this is the content of the Banach\u2013Stone theorem. Indeed, any commutative C*-algebra can be realized as the algebra of scalars of a Hausdorff space in this way, yielding the same correspondence as between a ring and its spectrum. Generalizing to \"non\"-commutative C*-algebras yields noncommutative topology.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Additionally, there are persons who, because of their writings or reputation, are considered to have held Unitarian or Universalist beliefs. Individuals who held unitarian (nontrinitarian) beliefs but were not affiliated with Unitarian organizations are often referred to as \"small 'u'\" unitarians. The same principle can be applied to those who believed in universal salvation but were not members of Universalist organizations. This article, therefore, makes the distinction between capitalized \"Unitarians\" and \"Universalists\" and lowercase \"unitarians\" and \"universalists\".\nThe Unitarians and Universalists are groups that existed long before the creation of Unitarian Universalism.\nEarly Unitarians did not hold Universalist beliefs, and early Universalists did not hold Unitarian beliefs. But beginning in the nineteenth century the theologies of the two groups started becoming more similar.\nAdditionally, their eventual merger as the Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) did not eliminate divergent Unitarian and Universalist congregations, especially outside the US.

While criminal procedure differs dramatically by jurisdiction, the process generally begins with a formal criminal charge with the person on trial either being free on bail or incarcerated, and results in the conviction or acquittal of the defendant. Criminal procedure can be either in form of inquisitorial or adversarial criminal procedure.\nBasic rights.\nCurrently, in many countries with a democratic system and the rule of law, criminal procedure puts the burden of proof on the prosecution \u2013 that is, it is up to the prosecution to prove that the defendant is guilty beyond any reasonable doubt, as opposed to having the defence prove that they are innocent, and any doubt is resolved in favor of the defendant. This provision, known as the presumption of innocence, is required, for example, in the 46 countries that are members of the Council of Europe, under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and it is included in other human rights documents. However, in practice, it operates somewhat differently in different countries. These basic rights also include the right of the defendant to know the offence for which they have been arrested or charged, and the right to appear before a judicial official within a specified time after arrest. Many jurisdictions also allow the defendant the right to legal counsel and provide any defendant who cannot afford their own lawyer with a lawyer paid for at the public expense. \nDifference between criminal and civil cases.\nCountries using the common law tend to make a clear distinction between civil and criminal procedures. For example, an English criminal court may force a convicted accused to pay a fine to the Crown as punishment for the crime, and sometimes to pay the legal costs of the prosecution, but does not normally order the convicted accused to pay any compensation to the victim of the crime. The victim must pursue their claim for compensation in a civil, not a criminal, action. In countries using the continental civil law system, such as France and Italy, the victim of a crime (known as the \"injured party\") may be awarded damages by a criminal court judge.\nThe standards of proof are higher in a criminal action than in a civil one since the loser risks not only financial penalties but also being sent to prison (or, in some countries, execution). In English law, the prosecution must prove the guilt of a criminal \"beyond reasonable doubt\", while the plaintiff in a civil action is required to prove his case \"on the balance of probabilities\". \"Beyond reasonable doubt\" is not defined for the jury which decides the verdict, but it has been said by appeal courts that proving guilt beyond reasonable doubt requires the prosecution to exclude any reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence: \"Plomp v. R\". In a civil case, however, the court simply weighs the evidence and decides what is most probable.\nCriminal and civil procedure are different. Although some systems, including the English, allow a private citizen to bring a criminal prosecution against another citizen, criminal actions are nearly always started by the state. Civil actions, on the other hand, are usually started by individuals.\nIn Anglo-American law, the party bringing a criminal action (that is, in most cases, the state) is called the prosecution, but the party bringing a civil action is the plaintiff. In a civil action the other party is known as the defendant. In a criminal case, the private party may be known as the \"defendant\" or the \"accused\". A criminal case in the United States against a person named Ms. Sanchez would be entitled \"United States v.\" (short for \"versus\", or against) \"Sanchez\" if initiated by the federal government; if brought by a state, the case would typically be called \"State v. Sanchez\" or \"People v. Sanchez.\" In the United Kingdom, the criminal case would be styled \"R.\" (short for Rex or Regina, that is, the King or Queen) \"v. Sanchez.\" In both the United States and the United Kingdom, a civil action between Ms. Sanchez and a Mr. Smith would be \"Sanchez v. Smith\" if started by Sanchez and \"Smith v. Sanchez\" if begun by Smith.\nEvidence given at a criminal trial is not necessarily admissible in a civil action about the same matter, just as evidence given in a civil cause is not necessarily admissible on a criminal trial. For example, the victim of a road accident does not directly benefit if the driver who injured him is found guilty of the crime of careless driving. He still has to prove his case in a civil action. In fact he may be able to prove his civil case even when the driver is found not guilty in the criminal trial. If the accused has given evidence on his trial he may be cross-examined on those statements in a subsequent civil action regardless of the criminal verdict.\nOnce the plaintiff has shown that the defendant is liable, the main argument in a civil court is about the amount of money, or damages, which the defendant should pay to the plaintiff.\nDifferences between civil law and common law systems.\nProponents of either system tend to consider that their system defends best the rights of the innocent. There is a tendency in common law countries to believe that civil law / inquisitorial systems do not have the so-called \"presumption of innocence\", and do not provide the defence with adequate rights. Conversely, there is a tendency in countries with an inquisitorial system to believe that accusatorial proceedings unduly favour rich defendants who can afford large legal teams, and therefore disfavour poorer defendants.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is one of 22 scheduled languages, as well as one of 11 classical languages, of India. Malayalam has official language status in Kerala, Lakshadweep and Puducherry (Mah\u00e9).\nMalayalam is spoken by significant numbers of people in India and is the majority language in the state of Kerala. Malayalam is also spoken by linguistic minorities in the neighbouring states; with a significant number of speakers in the Kodagu and Dakshina Kannada districts of Karnataka, and Kanyakumari, Coimbatore and Nilgiris district of Tamil Nadu. It is also spoken by the Malayali Diaspora worldwide, especially in the Persian Gulf countries, due to the large populations of Malayali expatriates there. They are a significant population in each city in India including Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad etc.\nThe origin of Malayalam remains a matter of dispute among scholars. The mainstream view holds that Malayalam descends from a western coastal dialect of early Middle Tamil and separated from it sometime between the 9th and 13th centuries, although this medieval western dialect also preserved some archaisms suggesting an earlier divergence of the spoken dialects in the prehistoric period. A second view argues for the development of the two languages out of \"Proto-Dravidian\" or \"Proto-Tamil-Malayalam\" either in the prehistoric period or in the middle of the first millennium A.D., although this is generally rejected by historical linguists. The Quilon Syrian copper plates of 849/850 CE are considered by some to be the oldest available inscription written in Old Malayalam. However, the existence of Old Malayalam is sometimes disputed by scholars. They regard the Chera Perumal inscriptional language as a diverging dialect or variety of contemporary Tamil. The oldest extant literary work in Malayalam distinct from the Tamil tradition is \"Ramacharitam\" (late 12th or early 13th century).\nThe earliest script used to write Malayalam was the Vatteluttu script. The current Malayalam script is based on the Vatteluttu script, which was extended with Grantha script letters to adopt Indo-Aryan loanwords. It bears high similarity with the Tigalari script, a historical script that was used to write the Tulu language in South Canara, and Sanskrit in the adjacent Malabar region. The modern Malayalam grammar is based on the book \"Kerala Panineeyam\" written by A. R. Raja Raja Varma in late 19th century CE. The first travelogue in any Indian language is the Malayalam \"Varthamanappusthakam\", written by Paremmakkal Thoma Kathanar in 1785.\nRobert Caldwell describes the extent of Malayalam in the 19th century as extending from the vicinity of Kumbla in the north where it supersedes with Tulu to Kanyakumari in the south, where it begins to be superseded by Tamil, beside the inhabited islands of Lakshadweep in the Arabian Sea.\nEtymology.\nIn a 7th-century poem written by the Tamil poet Sambandar the people of Kerala are referred to as \"malaiy\u0101\u1e37ar\" (mountain people). The word is also said to originate from the words , meaning 'mountain', and , meaning 'region' or '-ship' (as in \"township\"); thus translates directly as 'the mountain region'. The term \"Malabar\" was used as an alternative term for \"Malayalam\" in foreign trade circles to denote the southwestern coast of the Indian peninsula, which also means \"The land of hills\". The term originally referred to the western hilly land of the Chera dynasty (later Zamorins and the Kingdom of Cochin), Kingdom of Ezhimala (later Kolathunadu), and Ay kingdom (later Travancore), and only later became the name of its language. The language Malayalam was alternatively called , , , , , , , and until the early 19th century CE.\nThe earliest extant literary works in the regional language of present-day Kerala probably date back to as early as the 12th century. At that time, the language was differentiated by the name \"Kerala Bhasha\". The earliest mention of Malayalam as a language is found outside of Kerala in the 15th century Telugu work \u015ar\u012bbh\u012bm\u0113\u015bvarapur\u0101\u1e47amu by \u015ar\u012bn\u0101tha. The distinctive \"Malayalam\" named identity of this language appears to have come into existence in Kerala only around the 16th century, when it was known as \"Malayayma\" or \"Malayanma\"; the words were also used to refer to the script and the region. According to Duarte Barbosa, a Portuguese visitor who visited Kerala in the early 16th century CE, the people in the southwestern Malabar coast of India from Kumbla in north to Kanyakumari in south had a unique language, which was called \"Maliama\" by them.\nPrior to this period, the people of Kerala usually referred to their language as \"Tamil\", and both terms overlapped into the colonial period.\nHistory.\nDue to the geographical isolation of the Malabar Coast from the rest of the Indian peninsula due to the presence of the Western Ghats mountain ranges which lie parallel to the coast, the dialect of Old Tamil spoken in Kerala was different from that spoken in Tamil Nadu. The mainstream view holds that Malayalam began to grow as a distinct literary language from the western coastal dialect of Middle Tamil and the linguistic separation completed sometime between the 9th and 13th centuries. The renowned poets of Classical Tamil such as Paranar (1st century CE), Ilango Adigal (2nd\u20133rd century CE), and Kulasekhara Alvar (9th century CE) were Keralites. The Sangam works can be considered as the ancient predecessor of Malayalam.\nAccording to Govindankutty, both Tamil and Malayalam developed during the prehistoric period from a common ancestor, \"Proto-Tamil-Malayalam\", and that the notion of Malayalam being a \"daughter\" of Tamil is misplaced. This is based on the fact that Malayalam and several Dravidian languages on the Western Coast have common archaic features which are not found even in the oldest historical forms of literary Tamil. Despite this, Malayalam shares many common innovations with Tamil that emerged during the early Middle Tamil period, thus making independent descent untenable. \nIndeed, most features of Malayalam morphology are derivable from a form of speech corresponding to early Middle Tamil.\nRobert Caldwell, in his 1856 book \"A Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian or South-Indian Family of Languages\", opined that literary Malayalam branched from \"Classical Tamil\" and over time gained a large amount of Sanskrit vocabulary and lost the personal terminations of verbs. As the language of scholarship and administration, Old-Tamil, which was written in Tamil-Brahmi and the Vatteluttu alphabet later, greatly influenced the early development of Malayalam as a literary language. The Malayalam script began to diverge from the \"Vatteluttu\" and the Western Grantha scripts in the 8th and 9th centuries of Common Era. By the end of the 13th century, a written form of the language emerged which was unique from the \"Vatteluttu\" script that was used to write Tamil on the eastern coast.\nOld Malayalam.\nOld Malayalam (), an inscriptional language found in Kerala from the 9th to the 13th century CE, is the earliest attested form of Malayalam. The development of Old Malayalam from a western coastal dialect of Middle Tamil began around the 8th century CE. It remained a west coast dialect until circa 9th century CE or a little later. The origin of Malayalam calendar dates back to year 825 CE. It is generally agreed that the western coastal dialect of Tamil began to separate, diverge, and grow as a distinct language due to geographical separation of Kerala from the Tamil country and the influence of Sanskrit and Prakrit from the Nambudiri Brahmins of the Malabar Coast.\nThe Old Malayalam language was employed in several official records and transactions (at the level of the Chera Perumal kings, as well as the upper-caste (Nambudiri) village temples). Most of the inscriptions in Old Malayalam were found from the northern districts of Kerala, which lie adjacent to Tulu Nadu. Old Malayalam was mostly written in Vatteluttu script (with Pallava/Southern Grantha characters). Old Malayalam had several features distinct from the contemporary Tamil, including the nasalisation of adjoining sounds, substitution of palatal sounds for dental sounds, contraction of vowels, and the rejection of gender verbs. \"Ramacharitam\" and \"Thirunizhalmala\" are the possible literary works of Old Malayalam found so far.\nMiddle Malayalam.\nOld Malayalam gradually developed into Middle Malayalam (\"Madhyakaala Malayalam\") by the 13th century CE. Malayalam literature also completely diverged from Tamil literature during this period. Works including \"Unniyachi Charitham\", \"Unnichiruthevi Charitham\", and \"Unniyadi Charitham\", are written in Middle Malayalam, and date back to the 13th and 14th centuries of the Common Era. The \"Sandesha Kavya\"s of 14th century CE written in Manipravalam language include \"Unnuneeli Sandesam\". \"Kannassa Ramayanam\" and \"Kannassa Bharatham\" by \"Rama Panikkar\" of the Niranam poets who lived between 1350 and 1450, are representative of this language. Ulloor has opined that Rama Panikkar holds the same position in Malayalam literature that Edmund Spenser does in English literature. The \"Champu Kavyas\" written by Punam Nambudiri, one among the \"Pathinettara Kavikal\" (Eighteen and a half poets) in the court of the Zamorin of Calicut, also belong to Middle Malayalam. The literary works of this period were heavily influenced by Manipravalam, which was a combination of contemporary Tamil and Sanskrit. The word \"Mani-Pravalam\" literally means \"Diamond-Coral\" or \"Ruby-Coral\". The 14th-century \"Lilatilakam\" text states Manipravalam to be a \"Bhashya\" (language) where \"Dravida and Sanskrit should combine together like ruby and coral, without the least trace of any discord\". The scripts of \"Kolezhuthu\" and \"Malayanma\" were also used to write Middle Malayalam. In addition to \"Vatteluthu\" and Grantha script, those were used to write Old Malayalam. The literary works written in Middle Malayalam were heavily influenced by Sanskrit and Prakrit, while comparing them with the modern Malayalam literature.\nModern Malayalam.\nThe Middle Malayalam was succeeded by Modern Malayalam (\"Aadhunika Malayalam\") by 15th century CE. The poem \"Krishnagatha\" written by Cherusseri Namboothiri, who was the court poet of the king Udaya Varman Kolathiri (1446\u20131475) of Kolathunadu, is written in modern Malayalam. The language used in \"Krishnagatha\" is the modern spoken form of Malayalam. During the 16th century CE, Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan from the Kingdom of Tanur and Poonthanam Nambudiri from the Kingdom of Valluvanad, followed the new trend initiated by Cherussery in their poems. The \"Adhyathmaramayanam Kilippattu\" and \"Mahabharatham Kilippattu,\" written by Ezhuthachan, and \"Jnanappana,\" written by Poonthanam, are also included in the earliest form of Modern Malayalam.\nThunchaththu Ezhuthachan is also credited with developing the Malayalam script into the current form through the intermixing and modification of the erstwhile scripts of \"Vatteluttu\", \"Kolezhuthu\", and Grantha script, which were used to write the inscriptions and literary works of Old and Middle Malayalam. He further eliminated excess and unnecessary letters from the modified script. Hence, Ezhuthachan is also known as \"The Father of modern Malayalam\". The development of modern Malayalam script was also heavily influenced by the Tigalari script, which was used to write Sanskrit, due to the influence of Tuluva Brahmins in Kerala. The language used in the Arabi Malayalam works of the 16th\u201317th century CE is a mixture of Modern Malayalam and Arabic. They follow the syntax of modern Malayalam, though written in a modified form of Arabic script, which is known as Arabi Malayalam script. P. Shangunny Menon ascribes the authorship of the medieval work \"Keralolpathi\", which describes the Parashurama legend and the departure of the final Cheraman Perumal king to Mecca, to Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan.\nKunchan Nambiar introduced a new literary form called \"Thullal\", and Unnayi Variyar introduced reforms in \"Attakkatha literature\". The printing, prose literature, and Malayalam journalism, developed after the latter-half of the 18th century CE. Modern literary movements in Malayalam literature began in the late 19th century with the rise of the famous Modern Triumvirate consisting of Kumaran Asan, Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer and Vallathol Narayana Menon. In the second half of the 20th century, Jnanpith winning poets and writers like G. Sankara Kurup, S. K. Pottekkatt, Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai, M. T. Vasudevan Nair, O. N. V. Kurup, and Akkitham Achuthan Namboothiri, had made valuable contributions to the modern Malayalam literature. The life and works of Edasseri Govindan Nair have assumed greater socio-literary significance after his death and Edasseri is now recognised as an important poet of Malayalam. Later, writers like O. V. Vijayan, Kamaladas, M. Mukundan, Arundhati Roy, and Vaikom Muhammed Basheer, have gained international recognition. Malayalam has also borrowed a lot of its words from various foreign languages: mainly from the Semitic languages including Arabic, and the European languages including Dutch and Portuguese, due to the long heritage of Indian Ocean trade and the Portuguese-Dutch colonization of the Malabar Coast.\nMalayalam is taught in public schools of Kerala,Lakshadweep and Puducherry (Mah\u00e9) (India).The language is also taught in Indian schools in the Middle East.\nDialects.\nVariations in intonation patterns, vocabulary, and distribution of grammatical and phonological elements are observable along the parameters of region, religion, community, occupation, social stratum, style and register.\nAccording to the Dravidian Encyclopedia, the regional dialects of Malayalam can be divided into fifteen dialect areas. They are as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAccording to Ethnologue, the dialects are: Malabar, Nagari-Malayalam, North Kerala, Central Kerala, South Kerala, Kayavar, Namboodiri, Nair, Mappila, Beary, Jeseri, Yerava, Pulaya, Nasrani, and Kasargod. The community dialects are: Namboodiri, Nair, Arabi Malayalam, Pulaya, and Nasrani. Whereas both the Namboothiri and Nair dialects have a common nature, the Arabi Malayalam is among the most divergent of dialects, differing considerably from literary Malayalam. Jeseri is a dialect of Malayalam spoken mainly in the Union territory of Lakshadweep and Beary is spoken in Tulu Nadu which are nearer to Kerala. Of the total 33,066,392 Malayalam speakers in India in 2001, 33,015,420 spoke the standard dialects, 19,643 spoke the \"Yerava\" dialect and 31,329 spoke non-standard regional variations like \"Eranadan\".\nThe dialects of Malayalam spoken in the districts like Kasaragod, Kannur, Wayanad, Kozhikode, and Malappuram in the former Malabar District have few influences from Kannada. For example, the words those start with the sound \"V\" in Malayalam become \"B\" in these districts as in Kannada. Also the Voiced retroflex approximant (/\u027b/) which is seen in both Tamil and the standard form of Malayalam, are not seen in the northern dialects of Malayalam, as in Kannada. For example, the words \"Vazhi\" (Path), \"Vili\" (Call), \"Vere\" (Another), and \"Vaa\" (Come/Mouth), become \"Bayi\", \"Bili\", \"Bere\", and \"Baa\" in the northern dialects of Malayalam. Similarly the Malayalam spoken in the southern districts of Kerala, i.e., Thiruvananthapuram-Kollam-Pathanamthitta area is influenced by Tamil.\nLabels such as \"Nampoothiri Dialect\", \"Mappila Dialect\", and \"Nasrani Dialect\" refer to overall patterns constituted by the sub-dialects spoken by the subcastes or sub-groups of each such caste. The most outstanding features of the major communal dialects of Malayalam are summarized below:\nExternal influences and loanwords.\nMalayalam has incorporated many elements from other languages over the years, the most notable of these being Sanskrit and later, English. According to Sooranad Kunjan Pillai who compiled the authoritative Malayalam lexicon, the other principal languages whose vocabulary was incorporated over the ages were Arabic, Dutch, Hindustani, Pali, Persian, Portuguese, Prakrit, and Syriac.\nGeographic distribution and population.\nMalayalam is a language spoken by the native people of southwestern India and the islands of Lakshadweep in the Arabian Sea. According to the Indian census of 2011, there were 32,413,213 speakers of Malayalam in Kerala, making up 93.2% of the total number of Malayalam speakers in India, and 97.03% of the total population of the state. There were a further 7,74,057 (2.22% of the total number) in Karnataka, 7,26,096 (2.05%) in Tamil Nadu, and 406,358 (1.2%) in Maharashtra.\nThe number of Malayalam speakers in Lakshadweep is 51,100, which is only 0.15% of the total number, but is as much as about 84% of the population of Lakshadweep. Malayalam was the most spoken language in erstwhile Gudalur taluk (now Gudalur and Panthalur taluks) of Nilgiris district in Tamil Nadu which accounts for 48.8% population and it was the second most spoken language in Mangalore and Puttur taluks of South Canara accounting for 21.2% and 15.4% respectively according to 1951 census report. 25.57% of the total population in the Kodagu district of Karnataka are Malayalis, and they form the single largest linguistic group accounting for 35.5% in the Virajpet Taluk. Around one-third of the Malayalis in Kodagu district speak the Yerava dialect according to the 2011 census, which is native to Kodagu and Wayanad.\nIn all, Malayalis made up 3.22% of the total Indian population in 2011. Of the total 34,713,130 Malayalam speakers in India in 2011, 33,015,420 spoke the standard dialects, 19,643 spoke the \"Yerava\" dialect and 31,329 spoke non-standard regional variations like \"Eranadan\". As per the 1991 census data, 28.85% of all Malayalam speakers in India spoke a second language and 19.64% of the total knew three or more languages.\nJust before independence, Malaya attracted many Malayalis. Large numbers of Malayalis have settled in Chennai, Bengaluru, Mangaluru, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Pune, Mysuru and Delhi. Many Malayalis have also emigrated to the Middle East, the United States, and Europe. There were 179,860 speakers of Malayalam in the United States, according to the 2000 census, with the highest concentrations in Bergen County, New Jersey, and Rockland County, New York. There are 144,000 of Malayalam speakers in Malaysia. There were 11,687 Malayalam speakers in Australia in 2016. The 2001 Canadian census reported 7,070 people who listed Malayalam as their mother tongue, mainly in Toronto. The 2006 New Zealand census reported 2,139 speakers. 134 Malayalam speaking households were reported in 1956 in Fiji. There is also a considerable Malayali population in the Persian Gulf regions, especially in Dubai, Kuwait and Doha.\nPhonology.\nFor the consonants and vowels, the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) symbol is given, followed by the Malayalam character and the ISO 15919 transliteration. The current Malayalam script bears high similarity with Tigalari script, which was used for writing the Tulu language, spoken in coastal Karnataka (Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts) and the northernmost Kasargod district of Kerala. Tigalari script was also used for writing Sanskrit in Malabar region.\nVowels.\nMalayalam has also borrowed the Sanskrit diphthongs of (represented in Malayalam as , ai) and (represented in Malayalam as , au) although these mostly occur only in Sanskrit loanwords. Traditionally (as in Sanskrit), four vocalic consonants (usually pronounced in Malayalam as consonants followed by the , which is not officially a vowel, and not as actual vocalic consonants) have been classified as vowels: vocalic r (, , r\u0325), long vocalic r (, , r\u0325\u0304), vocalic l (, , l\u0325) and long vocalic l (, , l\u0325\u0304). Except for the first, the other three have been omitted from the current script used in Kerala as there are no words in current Malayalam that use them.\nSome authors say that Malayalam has no diphthongs and are clusters of V+glide j/\u028b while others consider all V+glide clusters to be diphthongs as in and \nVowel length is phonemic and all of the vowels have minimal pairs; for example \"thickness\", \"showed\", \"tapped\", \"twisted, stick, marble\", \"throw\", \"lots\"\nVowels tend to be fronted around palatalized consonants and backed around velarized consonants.\nSome speakers also have from English loanwords; e.g. \"bank\" but most speakers replace it with or ; or and or . \nColloquial and dialectal language.\nSource:\nSample text.\nThe following text is Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nEnglish.\nAll human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.\nRomanisation (ISO 15919).\nmanu\u1e63yarell\u0101varu\u1e41 tuly\u0101vak\u0101\u015ba\u1e45\u1e45a\u1e37\u014d\u1e6du\u1e41 antass\u014d\u1e6du\u1e41 sv\u0101tantryatt\u014d\u1e6du\u1e45k\u016b\u1e6di janicci\u1e6d\u1e6du\u1e37\u1e37avar\u0101\u1e47\u200c\u016d. any\u014dnya\u1e41 bhr\u0101tr\u0325bh\u0101vatt\u014d\u1e6de perum\u0101\u1e5fuv\u0101n\u0101\u1e47\u200c\u016d manu\u1e63yan\u016d viv\u0113kabuddhiyu\u1e41 manas\u0101k\u1e63iyu\u1e41 siddham\u0101yirikkunnat\u200c\u016d.\nIPA.\n/manu\u0282ja\u027eella\u02d0\u028ba\u027eum t\u032aulja\u02d0\u028baka\u02d0\u0283a\u014b\u014ba\u026do\u02d0\u0288um an\u032at\u032aasso\u02d0\u0288um s\u028ba\u02d0t\u032aan\u032at\u032arjat\u032at\u032ao\u02d0\u0288u\u014bku\u02d0\u0288i d\u0361\u0292anit\u0361\u0283t\u0361\u0283i\u0288\u0288u\u026d\u026da\u028ba\u027ea\u02d0\u0273\u0268\u0306 \u01c1 anjo\u02d0njam b\u02b1ra\u02d0t\u032ar\u0268\u0306b\u02b1a\u02d0\u028bat\u032at\u032ao\u02d0\u0288e pe\u027euma\u02d0ru\u028ba\u02d0na\u02d0\u0273\u0268\u0306 manu\u0282jan\u0268\u0306 \u028bi\u028be\u02d0kabud\u032ad\u032a\u02b1ijum manasa\u02d0k\u0282ijum sid\u032ad\u032a\u02b1ama\u02d0ji\u027eikkun\u032a\u02d0at\u032a\u0268\u0306 \u01c1/\nGrammar.\nMalayalam has a canonical word order of SOV (subject\u2013object\u2013verb), as do other Dravidian languages. A rare OSV word order occurs in interrogative clauses when the interrogative word is the subject. Both adjectives and possessive adjectives precede the nouns they modify. Malayalam has 6 or 7 grammatical cases. Verbs are conjugated for tense, mood and aspect, but not for person, gender nor number except in archaic or poetic language. The modern Malayalam grammar is based on the book \"Kerala Panineeyam\" written by A. R. Raja Raja Varma in late 19th century CE.\nNouns.\nThe declensional paradigms for some common nouns and pronouns are given below. As Malayalam is an agglutinative language, it is difficult to delineate the cases strictly and determine how many there are, although seven or eight is the generally accepted number. Alveolar plosives and nasals (although the modern Malayalam script does not distinguish the latter from the dental nasal) are underlined for clarity, following the convention of the National Library at Kolkata romanization.\nPersonal pronouns.\nVocative forms are given in parentheses after the nominative, as the only pronominal vocatives that are used are the third person ones, which only occur in compounds.\nOther nouns.\nThe following are examples of some of the most common declension patterns.\nWords adopted from Sanskrit.\nWhen words are adopted from Sanskrit, their endings are usually changed to conform to Malayalam norms:\nWriting system.\nAside from the Malayalam script, the Malayalam language has been written in other scripts like Latin, Syriac and Arabic. Suriyani Malayalam was used by Saint Thomas Christians (also known as Nasranis) until the 19th century. Arabic scripts particularly were taught in madrasahs in Kerala and the Lakshadweep Islands.\nMalayalam script.\nHistorically, several scripts were used to write Malayalam. Among these were the Vatteluttu, Kolezhuthu and Malayanma scripts. But it was the Grantha script, another Southern Brahmi variation, which gave rise to the modern Malayalam script. The modern Malayalam script bears high similarity to Tigalari script, which was used for writing Tulu language in Coastal Karnataka (Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts) and the northernmost Kasaragod district of Kerala. It is syllabic in the sense that the sequence of graphic elements means that syllables have to be read as units, though in this system the elements representing individual vowels and consonants are for the most part readily identifiable. In the 1960s Malayalam dispensed with many special letters representing less frequent conjunct consonants and combinations of the vowel /u, u:/ with different consonants.\nMalayalam script consists of a total of 578 characters. The script contains 52 letters including 16 vowels and 36 consonants, which forms 576 syllabic characters, and contains two additional diacritic characters named anusv\u0101ra and visarga. The earlier style of writing has been superseded by a new style as of 1981. This new script reduces the different letters for typesetting from 900 to fewer than 90. This was mainly done to include Malayalam in the keyboards of typewriters and computers.\nIn 1999 a group named \"Rachana Akshara Vedi\" produced a set of free fonts containing the entire character repertoire of more than 900 glyphs. This was announced and released along with a text editor in the same year at Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of Kerala. In 2004, the fonts were released under the GPL license by Richard Stallman. A dedicated Malayalam operating system was released in 2006.\nChillu letters.\nA \"chillu\" (, ), or a \"chillaksharam\" (, ), is a special consonant letter that represents a pure consonant independently, without help of a virama. Unlike a consonant represented by an ordinary consonant letter, this consonant is never followed by an inherent vowel. Anusvara and visarga fit this definition but are not usually included. ISCII and Unicode 5.0 treat a \"chillu\" as a glyph variant of a normal (\"base\") consonant letter. In Unicode 5.1 and later, \"chillu\" letters are treated as independent characters, encoded atomically.\nNumerals.\nMalayalam numbers and fractions are written as follows. These are archaic and no longer used. Instead, the common Hindu-Arabic numeral system is followed. There is a confusion about the glyph of Malayalam digit zero. The correct form is oval-shaped, but occasionally the glyph for &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20444 () is erroneously shown as the glyph for 0.\nNumber \"11\" is written as \"\u0d70\u0d67\" and not \"\u0d67\u0d67\". \"32\" is written as \"\u0d69\u0d70\u0d68\" similar to the Tamil numeral system.\nFor example, the number \"2013\" is read in Malayalam as (). It is split into:\nCombine them together to get the Malayalam number .\nAnd 1,00,000 as \" = hundred(), thousand() (100\u00d71000), 10,00,000 as \" = ten(), hundred(), thousand() (10\u00d7100\u00d71000) and 1,00,00,000 as \"\" = hundred(), hundred(), thousand() (100\u00d7100\u00d71000).\nLater on this system got reformed to be more similar to the Hindu-Arabic numerals so 10,00,000 in the reformed numerals it would be .\nFractions.\nIn Malayalam you can transcribe any fraction by affixing () after the denominator followed by the numerator, so a fraction like &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;7\u204410 would be read as () 'out of ten, seven' but fractions like &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20444 and &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20444 have distinct names (, , ) and &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20448 () 'half quarter'.\nVattezhuthu alphabet.\nVatteluttu (:\u00a0, , \"round writing\") is a script that had evolved from Tamil-Brahmi and was once used extensively in the southern part of present-day Tamil Nadu and in Kerala.\nMalayalam was first written in Vattezhuthu. The Vazhappally inscription issued by Rajashekhara Varman is the earliest example, dating from about 830 CE. During the medieval period, the Tigalari script that was used for writing Tulu in South Canara, and Sanskrit in the adjacent Malabar region, had a close similarity to the modern Malayalam script. In the Tamil country, the modern Tamil script had supplanted Vattezhuthu by the 15th century, but in the Malabar region, Vattezhuthu remained in general use up to the 17th century, or the 18th century. A variant form of this script, Kolezhuthu, was used until about the 19th century mainly in the Malabar-Cochin area.\nVatteluttu was in general use, but was not suitable for literature where many Sanskrit words were used. Like Tamil-Brahmi, it was originally used to write Tamil, and as such, did not have letters for voiced or aspirated consonants used in Sanskrit but not used in Tamil. For this reason, Vatteluttu and the Grantha alphabet were sometimes mixed, as in the Manipravalam. One of the oldest examples of the Manipravalam literature, \"Vaishikatantram\" (, \"Vai\u015bikatantram\"), dates back to the 12th century, where the earliest form of the Malayalam script was used, which seems to have been systematized to some extent by the first half of the 13th century.\nAnother variant form, Malayanma, was used in the south of Thiruvananthapuram. By the 19th century, old scripts like Kolezhuthu had been supplanted by Arya-eluttu \u2013 that is the current Malayalam script. Nowadays, it is widely used in the press of the Malayali population in Kerala.\nGrantha.\nAccording to Arthur Coke Burnell, one form of the Grantha alphabet, originally used in the Chola dynasty, was imported into the southwest coast of India in the 8th or 9th century, which was then modified in course of time in this secluded area, where communication with the east coast was very limited. It later evolved into Tigalari-Malayalam script was used by the Malayali, Havyaka Brahmins and Tulu Brahmin people, but was originally only applied to write Sanskrit. This script split into two scripts: Tigalari and Malayalam. While Malayalam script was extended and modified to write vernacular language Malayalam, the Tigalari was written for Sanskrit only. In Malabar, this writing system was termed Arya-eluttu (, \"\u0100rya e\u1e3butt\u016d\"), meaning \"Arya writing\" (Sanskrit is Indo-Aryan language while Malayalam is a Dravidian language).\nKarshoni.\nSuriyani Malayalam (\u0d38\u0d41\u0d31\u0d3f\u0d2f\u0d3e\u0d28\u0d3f \u0d2e\u0d32\u0d2f\u0d3e\u0d33\u0d02, \u0723\u0718\u072a\u071d\u0722\u071d \u0721\u0720\u071d\u0720\u0721), also known as \"Karshoni\", \"Syro-Malabarica\" or \"Syriac Malayalam\", is a version of Malayalam written in a variant form of the Syriac alphabet which was popular among the Saint Thomas Christians (also known as Syrian Christians or Nasranis) of Kerala in India. It uses Malayalam grammar, the Ma\u1e0fn\u1e25\u0101y\u0101 or \"Eastern\" Syriac script with special orthographic features, and vocabulary from Malayalam and East Syriac. This originated in the South Indian region of the Malabar Coast (modern-day Kerala). Until the 20th century, the script was widely used by Syrian Christians in Kerala.\nPonnani script.\nThe Arabi Malayalam script, otherwise known as the Ponnani script, is a writing system \u2013 a variant form of the Arabic script with special orthographic features \u2013 which was developed during the early medieval period and used to write Arabi Malayalam until the early 20th century CE. Though the script originated and developed in Kerala, today it is predominantly used in Malaysia and Singapore by the migrant Muslim community.\nLiterature.\nThe Sangam literature can be considered as the ancient predecessor of Malayalam. According to Iravatham Mahadevan, the earliest Malayalam inscription discovered until now is the Edakal-5 inscription (ca. late 4th century \u2013 early 5th century) reading (transl. 'this is old'). Although this has been disputed by many scholars who regard it as a regional dialect of Old Tamil. The use of the pronoun and the lack of the literary Tamil ending are archaisms from Proto-Dravidian rather than unique innovations of Malayalam.\nThe early literature of Malayalam comprised three types of composition:\nMalayalam Nada, Tamil Nada and Sanskrit Nada.\nMalayalam literature has been profoundly influenced by poets Cherusseri Namboothiri, Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan, and Poonthanam Nambudiri, in the 15th and the 16th centuries of Common Era. Unnayi Variyar, a probable 17th\u201318th century poet, and Kunchan Nambiar, a poet of 18th century, also greatly influenced Malayalam literature in its early form. The words used in many of the Arabi Malayalam works those date back to 16th\u201317th centuries of Common Era are also very closer to the modern Malayalam language. The prose literature, criticism, and Malayalam journalism began after the latter half of 18th century CE. Contemporary Malayalam literature deals with social, political, and economic life context. The tendency of the modern poetry is often towards political radicalism. Malayalam literature has been presented with six Jnanapith awards, the second-most for any Dravidian language and the third-highest for any Indian language.\nMalayalam poetry to the late 20th century betrays varying degrees of the fusion of the three different strands. The oldest examples of Pattu and Manipravalam, respectively, are \"Ramacharitam\" and \"Vaishikatantram\", both from the 12th century.\nThe earliest extant prose work in the language is a commentary in simple Malayalam, \"Bhashakautalyam\" (12th century) on Chanakya's \"Arthashastra\". Adhyatmaramayanam by Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan (known as the father of modern Malayalam literature) who was born in Tirur, one of the most important works in Malayalam literature. Unnunili Sandesam written in the 14th century is amongst the oldest literary works in Malayalam language. Cherusseri Namboothiri of 15th century (Kannur-based poet), Poonthanam Nambudiri of 16th century (Perinthalmanna-based poet), Unnayi Variyar of 17th\u201318th centuries (Thrissur-based poet), and Kunchan Nambiar of 18th century (Palakkad-based poet), have played a major role in the development of Malayalam literature into current form. The words used in many of the Arabi Malayalam works, which dates back to 16th\u201317th centuries are also very closer to modern Malayalam language. The basin of the river Bharathappuzha, which is otherwise known as River Ponnani, and its tributaries, have played a major role in the development of modern Malayalam Literature.\nBy the end of the 18th century some of the Christian missionaries from Kerala started writing in Malayalam but mostly travelogues, dictionaries and religious books. Varthamanappusthakam (1778), written by Paremmakkal Thoma Kathanar is considered to be the first travelogue in an Indian language. The modern Malayalam grammar is based on the book \"Kerala Panineeyam\" written by A. R. Raja Raja Varma in late 19th century CE.\nFolk Songs.\nFor the first 600 years of the Malayalam calendar, Malayalam literature remained in a preliminary stage. During this time, Malayalam literature consisted mainly of various genres of songs (\"Pattu\"). Folk songs are the oldest literary form in Malayalam. They were just oral songs. Many of them were related to agricultural activities, including \"Pulayar Pattu\", \"Pulluvan Pattu\", \"Njattu Pattu\", \"Koythu Pattu\", etc. Other Ballads of Folk Song period include the \"Vadakkan Pattukal\" (Northern songs) in North Malabar region and the \"Thekkan Pattukal\" (Southern songs) in Southern Travancore. Some of the earliest Mappila songs (Muslim songs) were also folk songs.\nOld and Middle Malayalam.\nThe earliest known poems in Malayalam, \"Ramacharitam\" and \"Thirunizhalmala\", dated to the 12th to 14th century, were completed before the introduction of the Sanskrit alphabet. It was written by a poet with the pen name \"Cheeramakavi\" who, according to poet Ulloor S Parameswara Iyer, was Sree Veerarama Varman, a king of southern Kerala from AD 1195 to 1208. However the claim that it was written in Southern Kerala is expired on the basis of new discoveries. Other experts, like Chirakkal T Balakrishnan Nair, K.M. George, M. M. Purushothaman Nair, and P.V. Krishnan Nair, state that the origin of the book is in Kasaragod district in North Malabar region. They cite the use of certain words in the book and also the fact that the manuscript of the book was recovered from Nileshwaram in North Malabar. The influence of \"Ramacharitam\" is mostly seen in the contemporary literary works of Northern Kerala. The words used in \"Ramacharitam\" such as \"Nade\" (\"Mumbe\"), \"Innum\" (\"Iniyum\"), \"Ninna\" (\"Ninne\"), Chaaduka (\"Eriyuka\") are special features of the dialect spoken in North Malabar (Kasaragod-Kannur region). Furthermore, the Thiruvananthapuram mentioned in \"Ramacharitham\" is not the Thiruvananthapuram in Southern Kerala. But it is Ananthapura Lake Temple of Kumbla in the northernmost Kasaragod district of Kerala. The word \"Thiru\" is used just by the meaning \"Honoured\". Today it is widely accepted that \"Ramacharitham\" was written somewhere in North Malabar (most likely near Kasaragod).\nBut the period of the earliest available literary document cannot be the sole criterion used to determine the antiquity of a language. In its early literature, Malayalam has songs, \"Pattu\", for various subjects and occasions, such as harvesting, love songs, heroes, gods, etc. A form of writing called \"Campu\" emerged from the 14th century onwards. It mixed poetry with prose and used a vocabulary strongly influenced by Sanskrit, with themes from epics and \"Puranas\".\nThe works including \"Unniyachi Charitham\", \"Unnichirudevi Charitham\", and \"Unniyadi Charitham\", are written in Middle Malayalam, those date back to 13th and 14th centuries of Common Era. The \"Sandesha Kavya\"s of 14th century CE written in Manipravalam language include \"Unnuneeli Sandesam\" The literary works written in Middle Malayalam were heavily influenced by Sanskrit and Prakrit, while comparing them with the modern Malayalam literature. The word \"Manipravalam\" literally means \"Diamond-Coral\" or \"Ruby-Coral\". The 14th-century \"Lilatilakam\" text states Manipravalam to be a \"Bhashya\" (language) where \"Malayalam and Sanskrit should combine together like ruby and coral, without the least trace of any discord\". The \"Champu Kavyas\" written by Punam Nambudiri, one among the \"Pathinettara Kavikal\" (Eighteen and a half poets) in the court of the Zamorin of Calicut, also belong to Middle Malayalam.\nModern Malayalam.\nThe poem \"Krishnagatha\" written by Cherusseri Namboothiri, who was the court poet of the king Udaya Varman Kolathiri (1446\u20131475) of Kolathunadu, is written in modern Malayalam. The language used in \"Krishnagatha\" is the modern spoken form of Malayalam. It appears to be the first literary work written in the present-day language of Malayalam. During the 16th century CE, Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan from the Kingdom of Tanur and Poonthanam Nambudiri from the Kingdom of Valluvanad followed the new trend initiated by Cherussery in their poems. The \"Adhyathmaramayanam Kilippattu\" and \"Mahabharatham Kilippattu\" written by Ezhuthachan and \"Jnanappana\" written by Poonthanam are also included in the earliest form of Modern Malayalam. The words used in most of the Arabi Malayalam works, which dates back to 16th\u201317th centuries, are also very closer to modern Malayalam language. P. Shangunny Menon ascribes the authorship of the medieval work \"Keralolpathi\", which describes the Parashurama legend and the departure of the final Cheraman Perumal king to Mecca, to Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan.\nKunchan Nambiar, the founder of \"Thullal\" movement, was a prolific literary figure of the 18th century.\nImpact of European scholars.\nThe British printed Malabar English Dictionary by Graham Shaw in 1779 was still in the form of a Tamil-English Dictionary. Paremmakkal Thoma Kathanar wrote the first Malayalam travelogue called \"Varthamanappusthakam\" in 1789.\nHermann Gundert, (1814\u20131893), a German missionary and scholar of exceptional linguistic talents, played a distinguishable role in the development of Malayalam literature. His major works are Keralolpathi (1843), Pazhancholmala (1845), Malayalabhaasha Vyakaranam (1851), \"Paathamala (1860) the first Malayalam school text book\", Kerala pazhama (1868), \"the first Malayalam dictionary (1872)\", Malayalarajyam (1879) \u2013 Geography of Kerala, \"Rajya Samacharam (1847 June) the first Malayalam news paper\", Paschimodayam (1879) \u2013 Magazine. He lived in Thalassery for around 20 years. He learned the language from well established local teachers Ooracheri Gurukkanmar from Chokli, a village near Thalassery and consulted them in works. He also translated the Bible into Malayalam.\nIn 1821, the Church Mission Society (CMS) at Kottayam in association with the Syriac Orthodox Church started a seminary at Kottayam in 1819 and started printing books in Malayalam when Benjamin Bailey, an Anglican priest, made the first Malayalam types. In addition, he contributed to standardizing the prose. Hermann Gundert from Stuttgart, Germany, started the first Malayalam newspaper, \"Rajya Samacaram\" in 1847 at Talasseri. It was printed at Basel Mission. Malayalam and Sanskrit were increasingly studied by Christians of Kottayam and Pathanamthitta. The Marthomite movement in the mid-19th century called for replacement of Syriac by Malayalam for liturgical purposes. By the end of the 19th century Malayalam replaced Syriac as language of Liturgy in all Syrian Christian churches.\n1850\u20131904.\nVengayil Kunhiraman Nayanar, (1861\u20131914) from Thalassery was the author of first Malayalam short story, Vasanavikriti. After him innumerable world class literature works by was born in Malayalam.\nO. Chandu Menon wrote his novels \"Indulekha\" and \"Saradha\" while he was the judge at Parappanangadi Munciff Court. \"Indulekha\" is also the first Major Novel written in Malayalam language.\nThe third quarter of the 19th century CE bore witness to the rise of a new school of poets devoted to the observation of life around them and the use of pure Malayalam. The major poets of the Venmani School were Venmani Achhan Nambudiripad (1817\u20131891), Venmani Mahan Nambudiripad (1844\u20131893), Poonthottam Achhan Nambudiri (1821\u20131865), Poonthottam Mahan Nambudiri (1857\u20131896) and the members of the Kodungallur Kovilakam (Royal Family) such as Kodungallur Kunjikkuttan Thampuran. The style of these poets became quite popular for a while and influenced even others who were not members of the group like Velutheri Kesavan Vaidyar (1839\u20131897) and Perunlli Krishnan Vaidyan (1863\u20131894). The Venmani school pioneered a style of poetry that was associated with common day themes, and the use of pure Malayalam (\"Pachcha Malayalam\") rather than Sanskrit.\nTwentieth century.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, Jnanpith winning poets and writers like G. Sankara Kurup, S. K. Pottekkatt, Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai, M. T. Vasudevan Nair, O. N. V. Kurup, Edasseri Govindan Nair and Akkitham Achuthan Namboothiri, had made valuable contributions to the modern Malayalam literature. Later, writers like O. V. Vijayan, Kamaladas, M. Mukundan, Arundhati Roy, and Vaikom Muhammed Basheer, have gained international recognition.\nProse.\nThe travelogues written by S. K. Pottekkatt were turning point in the travelogue literature. The writers like Kavalam Narayana Panicker have contributed much to Malayalam drama.\nThakazhi Sivasankara Pillai turned away from party politics and produced a moving romance in \"Chemmeen\" (Shrimps) in 1956. For S. K. Pottekkatt and Vaikom Muhammad Basheer, who had not dabbled in politics, the continuity is marked in the former's \"Vishakanyaka\" (Poison Maid, 1948) and the latter's \"Ntuppuppakkoranendarnnu\" (My Grandpa had an Elephant, 1951). The non-political social or domestic novel was championed by P. C. Kuttikrishnan (Uroob) with his \"Ummachu\" (1955) and \"Sundarikalum Sundaranmarum\" (Men and Women of Charm, 1958).\nIn 1957 Basheer's \"Pathummayude Aadu\" (Pathumma's Goat) brought in a new kind of prose tale, which perhaps only Basheer could handle with dexterity. The fifties thus mark the evolution of a new kind of fiction, which had its impact on the short stories as well. This was the auspicious moment for the entry of M. T. Vasudevan Nair and T. Padmanabhan upon the scene. Front runners in the post-modern trend include Kakkanadan, O. V. Vijayan, E. Harikumar, M. Mukundan and Anand.\nKerala has the highest media exposure in India with newspapers publishing in nine languages, mainly English and Malayalam.\nPoetry.\nContemporary Malayalam poetry deals with social, political, and economic life context. The tendency of the modern poetry is often towards political radicalism.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She is known for competing in the first-person shooter game \"Quake\" in the late 1990s, as well as contributing professionally to the video game industry.\nCompeting under the alias KillCreek, she was one of the first notable female esports players, gaining recognition for beating \"Quake\" designer John Romero in a \"Quake\" deathmatch in 1997. She was the first professional gamer signed to the Cyberathlete Professional League (CPL).\nCase worked for Ion Storm between 1997 and 2001, conducting quality assurance and level design. She left the company to manage Monkeystone Games with former Ion Storm employees Romero and Tom Hall. After a stint at Warner Bros. managing the production of mobile games, she began working at various companies in business development and sales.\nEarly life.\nCase was raised in Olathe, Kansas. Her parents are a science teacher and a social worker, and she has a younger brother named Andy. As a child, she enjoyed playing computer games. Her first gaming experiences were with \"Lode Runner\" and \"Joust\" on an Apple IIe computer her father bought when she was in second grade.\nCase attended Olathe East High School from 1991 to 1994. As the student government president, she was one of the plaintiffs in the 1995 court case \"Case v. Unified School District No. 233\". During the trial, students and parents in Olathe successfully challenged the school district's decision to ban \"Annie on my Mind\" from the school library. Case later attended the University of Kansas in hopes of getting into law school.\nCareer.\nProfessional \"Quake\" player and John Romero deathmatch.\nWhile at the University of Kansas as a freshman studying political science, Case enjoyed playing \"Doom\" and \"Doom II\" with her circle of friends. Through her then-boyfriend, Tom \"Entropy\" Kimzey, she became interested in playing \"Quake\" competitively. Case joined Kimzey's team, Impulse 9, and began competing under the name KillCreek. This alias was taken from the Lawrence, Kansas band Kill Creek, who had a member Case was friends with. Impulse 9 competed in the \"Quake\" competitive league Clanring, and won the T1 championship event in 1996.\nAfter a few months of competing and making a name for herself, Case traveled to Dallas on a pilgrimage to meet some of the developers of her favorite first-person-shooter computer games. During her trip, she got the chance to play a \"Quake\" deathmatch against the game's designer, John Romero, but was beaten by him in a close game. After Romero put up a web page jokingly insulting her skill at the game, Case publicly demanded a rematch with him. While Case initially struggled in the best-of-three rematch, she rallied back to win the first round 25\u201319, and went on to ultimately defeat Romero. As punishment, Romero agreed to set up a web page praising Case.\nCase was twenty years old at the time she won the rematch in 1997, and beating one of the co-creators of \"Quake\" at his own game brought her a lot of publicity. She gained a sponsor in computer mouse manufacturer SpaceTec IMC that year, and her victory against Romero received coverage in \"Rolling Stone\". Angel Munoz, the founder of the Cyberathlete Professional League (CPL), convinced Case to join his league in July 1997, becoming its first signed professional gamer. She eventually became one of the league's original founders. Case competed in the first all-female \"Quake\" tournament that year, coming in second behind Kornelia Takacs. With the stability of sponsors and a $1000 monthly stipend from the CPL, Case decided to drop out of university and move to Dallas in the middle of 1997; she said that while she had a passion for political science, she \"was not excited about the day-to-day aspects of politics or practicing law.\"\nTransition to game design.\nWhile playing professionally, Case began looking at game design as a potential career, stating, \"I love games, and I love competition\u2014but having no choice but to play the same game day-in and day-out with all sorts of pressure attached just didn't suit my nature.\" According to Case, she did freelance game design work from her Dallas home for two years after university, using free design tools that she downloaded. One of the first game levels she designed was for \"\" (1999). Setting up a small studio called Primitive Earthling Games, she and some friends created a \"Quake II\" add-on called \"Vengeance\" and submitted it to WizardWorks. However, it never became available for purchase due to publishing delays. Between 1998 and 2000, Case authored three strategy guide books for Prima Games: \"Jazz Jackrabbit 2\" (1998), \"Buck Bumble\" (1998), and \"Daikatana\" (2000). She also contributed to their \"Quake II\" strategy guide.\nCase was hired at Ion Storm in the summer of 1997 as a video game tester. After numerous members of the \"Daikatana\" development team left during the game's troubled production, Case accepted Romero's job offer to become a level designer in November 1998. Case helped design levels for \"Daikatana\" and \"Anachronox\" (2001). It was during this time period that Case began to date Romero. According to David Kushner's \"Masters of Doom\", it was at this point when Case \"radically reinvented herself\" by losing weight, bleaching her hair, and undergoing breast augmentation surgery. Case received further press coverage, appearing on the March 2000 cover of \"PC Accelerator\", and being featured as one of the \"Next Game Gods\" in the November 2000 issue of \"PC Gamer\". She was approached by \"Playboy\" to appear in a nude pictorial, based on an interview she did in the \"Los Angeles Times\". The pictorial was released online in May 2000. When asked about how she changed after moving to Dallas and making video games a career, Case responded:Making the leap to games helped me to realize that the only way to be truly happy is to live by your own rules, not limited by outside expectations. I love my job, found a wonderful boyfriend and truly found myself through games.Case was still involved in the Cyberathlete Professional League in some capacity. She eventually transitioned into being CPL's \"Master of Ceremonies\", and in 1999, Case joined the CPL's board of directors.\nCase left Ion Storm in January 2001 to follow Romero to his new company, Monkeystone Games, which was founded in August 2001. Monkeystone was a mobile game development company formed from Romero's interest in mobile games, sparked by him wanting to move away from the lengthy development cycles of big-budget computer games. Case worked as a producer for Monkeystone's first game, \"Hyperspace Delivery Boy!\", and also created the music and sound effects. She also was credited on titles like Monkeystone's \"Red Faction\" port for the N-Gage. After leaving Monkeystone Games, Case became a senior project manager for Warner Bros. Online's mobile group.\nSales and business development.\nAccording to Case, she decided at this point to slowly transition out of working in the game development industry, stating in an interview: There was a ton of harassment and hate and sexism and abuse. People would send me hate email all the time. ... The benefit of connecting with people was so drowned out by how bad it felt to be in the spotlight. Case recalled receiving the opportunity to leave game development when one of her contacts approached her about a potential junior sales position at his workplace. After leaving Warner Bros., Case was employed at Tira Wireless in sales and business development. Afterwards, she held a position with Spleak Media Network, where she was a director of product management.\nIn September 2008, she was vice president of business development and sales for fatfoogoo, an online commerce company. Case also served as Senior Director of Business Development at Live Gamer, and joined PlaySpan in 2010 as vice president of sales. PlaySpan was acquired by Visa in 2011.\nOn March 1, 2010, NewWorld, the former parent company of the CPL, announced that it had signed a two-year agreement with Stevie Case for the production of a new podcast show called \"Stevie FTW\". According to the website's RSS feed, the last podcast was uploaded on March 11, 2011, and the last social media update was on the same date.\nAfter working as the vice president of growth at San Francisco-based startup Layer, in 2022 Case became the Chief Revenue Officer at computer security firm Vanta. She is also listed as a participant in SheEO, a nonprofit supporting the funding of female entrepreneurs, as well as the female investor group 37 Angels.\nPersonal life.\nCase dated \"Quake\" player Tom \"Entropy\" Kimzey, who was also a University of Kansas student and a member of Impulse 9. According to the June 1997 issue of \"Spin\", they were involved romantically until the spring of 1997. Case had also dated game developer Tom Mustaine.\nSoon after defeating John Romero in a \"Quake\" deathmatch, she and Romero started dating. Case and Romero moved in together in 1999, but their relationship ended in May 2003.\nCase went on to marry a director of product development at THQ, and had a child with him. In a 2016 interview, Case stated that she had been a single parent with full custody of her child for eight years.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37304", "revid": "40347300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37304", "title": "Martin Heidegger", "text": "German philosopher (1889\u20131976)\nMartin Heidegger (; 26 September 1889 \u2013 26 May 1976) was a German philosopher known for contributions to phenomenology, hermeneutics, and existentialism. His work covers a range of topics including metaphysics, art, religion, and language.\nIn April 1933, Heidegger was elected as rector at the University of Freiburg and has been widely criticized for his membership and support for the Nazi Party during his tenure. After World War II, he was dismissed from Freiburg and banned from teaching after denazification hearings at Freiburg. There has been controversy about the relationship between his philosophy and Nazism.\nIn Heidegger's first major text, \"Being and Time\" (1927), \"Dasein\" is introduced as a term for the type of being that humans possess. Heidegger believed that \"Dasein\" already has a \"pre-ontological\" and concrete understanding that shapes how it lives, which he analyzed in terms of the unitary structure of \"being-in-the-world\". Heidegger used this analysis to approach the question of the meaning of being; that is, the question of how entities appear as the specific entities they are. In other words, Heidegger's governing \"question of being\" is concerned with what makes beings intelligible as beings.\nEarly life.\nHeidegger was born on 26 September 1889 in rural Me\u00dfkirch, Baden, the son of Johanna (Kempf) and Friedrich Heidegger. His father was the sexton of the village church, and the young Martin was raised Catholic.\nIn 1903, Heidegger began to train for the priesthood. He entered a Jesuit seminary in 1909, but was discharged within weeks because of heart trouble. It was during this time that he first encountered the work of Franz Brentano. From here he went on to study theology and scholastic philosophy at the University of Freiburg.\nIn 1911, he broke off training for the priesthood and turned his attention to recent philosophy, in particular, Edmund Husserl's \"Logical Investigations\". He graduated with a thesis on psychologism, \"The Doctrine of Judgment in Psychologism: A Critical-theoretical Contribution to Logic\", in 1914. The following year, he completed his habilitation thesis on Duns Scotus, which was directed by Heinrich Rickert, a neo-Kantian, and influenced by Husserl's phenomenology. The title has been published in several languages and in English is \"Duns Scotus's Doctrine of Categories and Meaning\".\nHe attempted to get the (Catholic) philosophy post at the University of Freiburg on 23 June 1916 but failed despite the support of Heinrich Finke. Instead, he worked first as an unsalaried Privatdozent then served as a soldier during the final year of World War I. His service was in the last ten months of the war, most of which he spent in meteorological unit on the western front upon being deemed unfit for combat.\nFrom 1919 to 1923, Heidegger taught courses at the University of Freiburg. At this time he also became an assistant to Husserl, who had been a professor there since 1916.\nMarburg.\nIn 1923, Heidegger was elected to an extraordinary professorship in philosophy at the University of Marburg. His colleagues there included Rudolf Bultmann, Nicolai Hartmann, Paul Tillich, and Paul Natorp. Heidegger's students at Marburg included Hans-Georg Gadamer, Helene Weiss, Karl L\u00f6with, Hannah Arendt, Gerhard Kr\u00fcger, Leo Strauss, Jacob Klein, G\u00fcnther Anders, and Hans Jonas. Following Aristotle, he began to develop in his lectures the main theme of his philosophy: the question of the sense of being. He extended the concept of subject to the dimension of history and concrete existence, which he found prefigured in such Christian thinkers as Paul of Tarsus, Augustine of Hippo, Martin Luther, and S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard. He also read the works of Wilhelm Dilthey, Husserl, Max Scheler, and Friedrich Nietzsche.\nIn 1927, Heidegger published his main work, \"Sein und Zeit\" (\"Being and Time\"). He was primarily concerned to qualify to be a full professor. The book, however, did more than this: it raised him to \"a position of international intellectual visibility.\"\nFreiburg.\nWhen Husserl retired as professor of philosophy in 1928, Heidegger accepted Freiburg's election to be his successor, in spite of a counter-offer by Marburg. The title of his 1929 inaugural lecture was \"What is Metaphysics?\" In this year he also published \"Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics\".\nHeidegger remained at Freiburg im Breisgau for the rest of his life, declining later offers including one from Humboldt University of Berlin. His students at Freiburg included Hannah Arendt, G\u00fcnther Anders, Hans Jonas, Karl L\u00f6with, Charles Malik, Herbert Marcuse, and Ernst Nolte. Emmanuel Levinas attended his lecture courses during his stay in Freiburg in 1928, as did Jan Pato\u010dka in 1933; Pato\u010dka in particular was deeply influenced by him.\nHeidegger was elected rector of the university on 21 April 1933; he joined the Nazi Party on 1 May, just three months after Adolf Hitler was appointed chancellor. During his time as rector he was a member and an enthusiastic supporter of the party. There is continuing controversy as to the relationship between his philosophy and his political allegiance to Nazism. He wanted to position himself as the philosopher of the party, but the highly abstract nature of his work and the opposition of Alfred Rosenberg, who himself aspired to act in that position, limited Heidegger's role. His withdrawal from his position as rector owed more to his frustration as an administrator than to any principled opposition to the Nazis, according to historians. In his inaugural address as rector on 27 May he expressed his support of a German revolution, and in an article and a speech to the students from the same year he also supported Adolf Hitler. In November 1933, Heidegger signed the \"Vow of allegiance of the Professors of the German Universities and High-Schools to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialistic State\". Heidegger resigned from the rectorate in April 1934 and pursued a teaching agenda aligned with Nazi cultural politics until 1945.\nIn 1935, he gave the talk \"The Origin of the Work of Art\". The next year, while in Rome, Heidegger gave his first lecture on Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin. In the years 1936\u20131937, Heidegger wrote what some commentators consider his second greatest work, \"Contributions to Philosophy\"; it would not be published, however, until 1989, 13 years after his death.\nFrom 1936 to 1940, Heidegger also delivered a series of lectures on Friedrich Nietzsche at Freiburg that presented much of the raw material incorporated in his more established work and thought from this time. These would appear in published form in 1961. This period also marks the beginning of his interest in the \"essence of technology\".\nIn the autumn of 1944, Heidegger was drafted into the \"Volkssturm\" and assigned to dig anti-tank ditches along the Rhine.\nPost-war.\nIn late 1946, as France engaged in \"\u00e9puration l\u00e9gale\" in its occupation zone, the French military authorities determined that Heidegger should be blocked from teaching or participating in any university activities because of his association with the Nazi Party. Nevertheless, he presented the talk \"What are Poets for?\" in memory of Rilke. He also published \"On Humanism\" in 1947 to clarify his differences with Jean-Paul Sartre and French existentialism. The denazification procedures against Heidegger continued until March 1949 when he was finally pronounced a \"Mitl\u00e4ufer\" (the second lowest of five categories of \"incrimination\" by association with the Nazi regime). No punitive measures against him were proposed. This opened the way for his readmission to teaching at Freiburg University in the winter semester of 1950\u201351. He was granted emeritus status and then taught regularly from 1951 until 1958, and by invitation until 1967.\nIn 1966, he gave an interview to \"Der Spiegel\" attempting to justify his support of the Nazi Party. Per their agreement, it was not published until five days after his death in 1976, under the title \"Only a God Can Save Us\" after a reference to H\u00f6lderlin that Heidegger makes during the interview.\nHeidegger's publications during this time were mostly reworked versions of his lectures. In his last days, he also arranged for a complete edition of his works to be compiled and published. Its first volume appeared in 1975. As of 2019, the edition is almost complete at over 100 volumes.\nEarly influences.\nEdmund Husserl, the founder of phenomenology, was Heidegger's teacher and a major influence on his thought. While the specific lines of influence remain a matter of scholarly dispute, one thing is clear: Heidegger's early work on \"Being and Time\" moved away from Husserl's theory of intentionality to focus on the pre-theoretical conditions that enable consciousness to grasp objects.\nAristotle influenced Heidegger from an early age. This influence was mediated through Catholic theology, medieval philosophy, and Franz Brentano. \nAccording to scholar Michael Wheeler, it is by way of a \"radical rethinking\" of Aristotle's \"Metaphysics\" that Heidegger supplants Husserl's notion of intentionality with his unitary notion of being-in-the-world. According to this reinterpretation, the various modes of being are united in more basic capacity of taking-as or making-present-to.\nThe works of Wilhelm Dilthey shaped Heidegger's very early project of developing a \"hermeneutics of factical life\", and his hermeneutical transformation of phenomenology. There is little doubt that Heidegger seized upon Dilthey's concept of hermeneutics. Heidegger's novel ideas about ontology required a \"gestalt\" formation, not merely a series of logical arguments, in order to demonstrate his fundamentally new paradigm of thinking, and the hermeneutic circle offered a new and powerful tool for the articulation and realization of these ideas.\nS\u00f8ren Kierkegaard contributed much to Heidegger's treatment of the existentialist aspects of his thought located in Division II of \"Being and Time\". Heidegger's concepts of anxiety (\"Angst\") and mortality draw on Kierkegaard and are indebted to the way in which the latter lays out the importance of our subjective relation to truth, our existence in the face of death, the temporality of existence, and the importance of passionate affirmation of one's individual being-in-the-world.\nPhilosophy.\nFundamental ontology.\nAccording to scholar Taylor Carman, traditional ontology asks \"Why is there anything?\", whereas Heidegger's fundamental ontology asks \"What does it mean for something to be?\" Heidegger's ontology \"is fundamental relative to traditional ontology in that it concerns what any understanding of entities necessarily presupposes, namely, our understanding of that by virtue of which entities are entities\".\nThis line of inquiry is \"central to Heidegger's philosophy\". He accuses the Western philosophical tradition of mistakenly trying to understand \"being as such\" as if it were an ultimate entity. Heidegger modifies traditional ontology by focusing instead on the \"meaning of being\". This kind of ontological inquiry, he claims, is required to understand the basis of our understanding, scientific and otherwise.\nIn short, before asking what exists, Heidegger contends that people must first examine what \"to exist\" even means.\n\"Being and Time\".\nIn his first major work, \"Being and Time\", Heidegger pursues this ontological inquiry by way of an analysis of the kind of being that people have, namely, that humans are the sort of beings able to pose the question of the meaning of being. According to Canadian philosopher Sean McGrath, Heidegger was probably influenced by Scotus in this approach. His term for us, in this phenomenological context, is Dasein.\nThis procedure works because Dasein's \"pre-ontological\" understanding of being shapes experience. Dasein's ordinary and even mundane experience of \"being-in-the-world\" provides \"access to the meaning\" or \"sense of being\"; that is, the terms in which \"something becomes intelligible as something.\" Heidegger proposes that this ordinary \"prescientific\" understanding precedes abstract ways of knowing, such as logic or theory. \"Being and Time\" is designed to show how this implicit understanding can be made progressively explicit through phenomenology and hermeneutics.\nBeing-in-the-world.\nHeidegger introduces the term Dasein to denote a \"living being\" through its activity of \"being there\". Understood as a unitary phenomenon rather than a contingent, additive combination, it is characterized by Heidegger as \"being-in-the-world\".\nHeidegger insists that the 'in' of Dasein's being-in-the-world is an 'in' of involvement or of engagement, not of objective, physical enclosedness. The sense in which Dasein is 'in' the world is the sense of \"residing\" or \"dwelling\" in the world. Heidegger provides a few examples: \"having to do with something, producing something, attending to something and looking after it, making use of something\".\nJust as 'being-in' does not denote objective, physical enclosedness, so 'world', as Heidegger uses the term, does not denote a universe of physical objects. The world, in Heidegger's sense, is to be understood according to our sense of our possibilities: things present themselves to people in terms of their projects, the uses to which they can put them. The 'sight' with which people grasp equipment is not a mentalistic intentionality, but what Heidegger calls 'circumspection'. This is to say that equipment reveals itself in terms of its 'towards-which,' in terms of the work it is good for. In the everyday world, people are absorbed within the equipmental totality of their work-world. Moreover, on Heidegger's analysis, this entails a radical holism. In his own words, \"there 'is' no such thing as \"an\" equipment\".\nFor example, when someone sits down to dinner and picks up their fork, they are not picking up an object with good stabbing properties: they are non-reflectively engaging an 'in-order-to-eat'. When it works as expected, equipment is transparent; when it is used, it is subsumed under the work toward which it is employed. Heidegger calls this structure of practically ordered reference relations the 'worldhood of the world'.\nHeidegger calls the mode of being of such entities \"ready-to-hand\", for they are understood only in being handled. If the fork is made of plastic, however, and it snaps in the course of using it, then it assumes the mode of being that Heidegger calls \"present-at-hand.\" For now the fork needs to be made the object of focal awareness, considering it in terms of its properties. Is it too broken to use? If so, could the diner possibly get by with another utensil or just with their fingers? This kind of equipmental breakdown is not the only way that objects become present-at-hand for us, but Heidegger considers it typical of the way that this shift occurs in the course of ordinary goings-on.\nIn this way, Heidegger creates a theoretical space for the categories of subject and object, while at the same time denying that they apply to our most basic way of moving about in the world, of which they are instead presented as derivative.\nHeidegger presents three primary structural features of being-in-the-world: understanding, attunement, and discourse. He calls these features \"existentiales\" or \"existentialia\" (\"Existenzialien\") to distinguish their ontological status, as distinct from the \"categories\" of metaphysics.\nHeidegger unifies these three existential features of Dasein in a composite structure he terms \"care\": \"ahead-of-itself-being-already-in-(the-world) as being-amidst (entities encountered within-the-world).\" What unifies this formula is \"temporality\". Understanding is oriented towards future possibilities, attunement is shaped by the past, and discourse discloses the present in those terms. In this way, the investigation into the being of Dasein leads to time. Much of Division II of \"Being and Time\" is devoted to a more fundamental reinterpretation of the findings of Division I in terms of Dasein's temporality.\n\"Das Man\".\nAs implied in the analysis of both attunement and discourse, Dasein is \"always already\", or a priori, a social being. In Heidegger's technical idiom, Dasein is \"Dasein-with\" (\"Mitsein\"), which he presents as equally primordial with \"being-one's self\" (\"Selbstsein\").\nHeidegger's term for this existential feature of Dasein is \"das Man\", which is a German pronoun, \"man\", that Heidegger turns into a noun. In English it is usually translated as either \"the they\" or \"the one\" (sometimes also capitalized); for, as Heidegger puts it, \"By 'others' we do not mean everyone else but me... They are rather those from whom for the most part, one does \"not\" distinguish oneself\u2014those among whom one is too\". Quite frequently the term is just left in the German.\nAccording to philosopher Hubert Dreyfus, part of Heidegger's aim is to show that, contrary to Husserl, individuals do not generate an intersubjective world from their separate activities; rather, \"these activities \"presuppose\" the disclosure of one shared world.\" This is one way in which Heidegger breaks from the Cartesian tradition of beginning from the perspective of individual subjectivity.\nDreyfus argues that the chapter on \"das Man\" is \"the most confused\" in \"Being and Time\" and so is often misinterpreted. The problem, he says, is that Heidegger's presentation conflates two opposing influences. The first is Dilthey's account of the role that public and historical contexts have in the production of significance. The second is Kierkegaard's insistence that truth is never to be found in the crowd.\nThe Diltheyian dimension of Heidegger's analysis positions \"das Man\" as ontologically existential in the same way as understanding, affectedness, and discourse. This dimension of Heidegger's analysis captures the way that a socio-historical \"background\" makes possible the specific significance that entities and activities can have. Philosopher Charles Taylor expands upon the term: \"It is that of which I am not simply unaware... but at the same time I cannot be said to be explicitly or focally aware of it, because that status is already occupied by what it is making intelligible\". For this reason, background non-representationally informs and enables engaged agency in the world, but is something that people can never make fully explicit to themselves.\nThe Kierkegaardian influence on Heidegger's analysis introduces a more existentialist dimension to \"Being and Time\". (Existentialism is a broad philosophical movement largely defined by Jean-Paul Sartre and is not to be confused with Heidegger's technical analysis of the specific existential features of Dasein.) Its central notion is \"authenticity\", which emerges as a problem from the \"publicness\" built into the existential role of \"das Man\". In Heidegger's own words:\nIn this inconspicuousness and unascertainability, the real dictatorship of the 'they' is unfolded. We take pleasure and enjoy ourselves as \"they\" take pleasure; we read, see and judge about literature and art as \"they\" see and judge; likewise we shrink back from the 'great mass' as \"they\" shrink back; we find 'shocking' what they find shocking. The 'they', which is nothing definite, and which we all are, through not as the sum, prescribes the kind of being of everydayness.\nThis \"dictatorship of \"das Man\"\" threatens to undermine Heidegger's entire project of uncovering the meaning of being because it does not seem possible, from such a condition, to even raise the question of being that Heidegger claims to pursue. He responds to this challenge with his account of authenticity.\nAuthenticity.\nHeidegger's term \"Eigentlichkeit\" is a neologism, in which Heidegger stresses the root \"eigen\", meaning \"own.\" So this word, usually translated \"authenticity\", could just as well be translated \"ownedness\" or \"being one's own\". Authenticity, according to Heidegger, is a matter of taking responsibility for being, that is, the stand that people take with respect to their ultimate projects. It is, in his terms, a matter of taking a properly \"resolute\" stand on \"for-the-sake-of-which\". Put differently, the \"self\" to which one is true in authenticity is not something just \"there\" to be discovered, but instead is a matter of \"on-going narrative construction\".\nScholars Somogy Varga and Charles Guignon describe three ways by which Dasein might attain an authentic relation to itself from out of its \"fallen\" condition as \"they\"-self. First, a powerful mood such as anxiety can disclose Dasein to itself as an ultimately isolated individual. Second, direct confrontation with Dasein's \"ownmost\" potential for death can similarly disclose to Dasein its own irreducible finitude. Third, experiencing \"the call of conscience\" can disclose to Dasein its own \"guilt\" (\"Schuld\") as the debt it has to itself in virtue of having taken over pre-given possibilities that it is now Dasein's own responsibility to maintain.\nPhilosopher Michael E. Zimmerman describes authenticity as \"resolving to accept the openness which, paradoxically, one already is\". He emphasizes that this is a matter, not of \"intellectual comprehension\", but of \"hard-won insight\". Authenticity is ultimately a matter of allowing the ego to be \"eclipsed by the manifestation of one's finitude\".\nAlthough the term \"authenticity\" disappears from Heidegger's writing after \"Being and Time\", Zimmerman argues that it is supplanted in his later thought by the less subjective or voluntaristic notion of \"Ereignis\". This ordinary German term for \"event\" or \"happening\" is theorized by Heidegger as the appropriation of Dasein into a cosmic play of concealment and appearance.\nLater works: The Turn.\nHeidegger's \"Turn\", which is sometimes referred to by the German \"die Kehre\", refers to a change in his work as early as 1930 that became clearly established by the 1940s, according to some commentators, who variously describe a shift of focus or a major change in outlook.\nHeidegger himself frequently used the term to refer to the shift announced at the end of \"Being and Time\" from \"being and time\" to \"time and being\". However, he rejected the existence of the \"sharp 'about turn'\" posited by some interpreters. Scholar Michael Inwood also calls attention to the fact that many of the ideas from \"Being and Time\" are retained in a different vocabulary in his later work\u2014and also that, in other cases, a word or expression common throughout his career comes to acquire a different meaning in the later works.\nThis supposed shift\u2014applied here to cover about 30 years of Heidegger's 40-year writing career\u2014has been described by commentators from widely varied viewpoints, for instance, from \"dwelling\" (being) in the world to \"doing\" (temporality) in the world. This aspect, in particular the 1951 essay \"Building Dwelling Thinking\", has influenced several architectural theorists.\nOther interpreters believe the Turn can be overstated or does not exist at all. For instance, Thomas Sheehan believes this supposed change is \"far less dramatic than usually suggested\", and entails merely a change in focus and method. Mark Wrathall argued that the Turn is not found in Heidegger's writings, but is simply a misconception.\nSome notable later works are \"The Origin of the Work of Art\" (1935), \"Contributions to Philosophy\" (1937), \"Letter on Humanism\" (1946), \"Building Dwelling Thinking\" (1951), \"The Question Concerning Technology\" (1954), and \"What Is Called Thinking?\" (1954).\nThe history of being.\nThe idea of asking about being may be traced back via Aristotle to Parmenides. Heidegger claims to revive this question of being that had been largely forgotten by the metaphysical tradition extending from Plato to Descartes, a forgetfulness extending into the Age of Enlightenment, as well as modern science and technology. In pursuit of the retrieval of the question, Heidegger spends considerable time reflecting on ancient Greek thought, in particular on Plato, Parmenides, Heraclitus, and Anaximander.\nIn his later philosophy, Heidegger attempts to reconstruct the \"history of being\" in order to show how the different epochs in the history of philosophy were dominated by different conceptions of being. His goal is to retrieve the original experience of being present in the early Greek thought that was covered up by later philosophers.\nAccording to W. Julian Korab-Karpowicz, Heidegger believed \"the thinking of Heraclitus and Parmenides, which lies at the origin of philosophy, was falsified and misinterpreted\" by Plato and Aristotle, thus tainting all of subsequent Western philosophy. In his \"Introduction to Metaphysics\", Heidegger states, \"Among the most ancient Greek thinkers, it is Heraclitus who was subjected to the most fundamentally un-Greek misinterpretation in the course of Western history, and who nevertheless in more recent times has provided the strongest impulses toward redisclosing what is authentically Greek.\"\nCharles Guignon writes that Heidegger aims to correct this misunderstanding by reviving Presocratic notions of being with an emphasis on \"understanding the way beings show up in (and as) an unfolding \"happening or event\".\" Guignon adds that \"we might call this alternative outlook 'event ontology.'\"\nLanguage.\nIn \"Being and Time\", language is presented as logically secondary to Dasein's understanding of the world and its significance. On this conception of worldhood, language can develop from prelinguistic significance.\nPost-turn, Heidegger refines his position to present some basic words (e.g., \"phusis\", the Greek term that roughly translates to \"nature\") as world-disclosive, that is, as establishing the foundational parameters in terms of which Dasein's understanding can occur in the specific ways that it does. It is in this context that Heidegger proclaims that \"Language is the house of being.\"\nIn the present age, he says, the language of \"technology\", or instrumental reason, flatten the significance of our world. For salvation, he turns to poetry.\nHeidegger rejected the notion of language being purely a means of communication. Language construed us such, he believed, would form the basis of an age of technology, the digital thought processes of which would only use language to organise and communicate the coverage of that which exists. Thinking in terms of calculation and digital processing would put man at odds with language, at the centre of everything that exists. If man would believe that they would have language at their disposal, that they would be the one to use it, then, Heidegger believed, man would completely miss the core tenet of language itself: \"It is language that speaks, not man. Man only speaks if they neatly correspond to language.\" In this way, Heidegger wanted to point out that man is only a \"participant\" of language that they have not themselves created. Man is bound within a sort of process of transfer and may only \"act\" with respect to anything the language conveys.\nIn this, however, Heidegger does not think in terms of philosophy of culture: The tautology of the formulation \"language speaks\" (originally in German \"die Sprache spricht\") is his way of trying to prevent the phenomenon of language to be used with respect to anything else than language itself. In line with his unique thinking, he is seeking to avoid having to justify the language by anything else. In this way, language could for instance never be explained by the sheer transmission of acoustic sounds, or speaking. According to Heidegger, language is rather difficult to fathom because we are too close to it, hence we need to speak about that which usually remains unmentioned because it is just to close to us. His work \"Unterwegs zur Sprache\" (\"On the way to language\") is an attempt to reach \"a place we already are in.\"\nInfluences.\nFriedrich Nietzsche and Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin were both important influences on Heidegger, and many of his lecture courses were devoted to one or the other, especially in the 1930s and 1940s. The lectures on Nietzsche focused on fragments posthumously published under the title \"The Will to Power\", rather than on Nietzsche's published works. Heidegger reads \"The Will to Power\" as the culminating expression of Western metaphysics, and the lectures are a kind of dialogue between the two thinkers.\nMichael Allen Gillespie says that Heidegger's theoretical acceptance of \"destiny\" has much in common with the millenarianism of Marxism. But Marxists believe Heidegger's \"theoretical acceptance is antagonistic to practical political activity and implies fascism\". Gillespie, however, says \"the real danger\" from Heidegger is not quietism but fanaticism. Modernity has cast mankind toward a new goal \"on the brink of profound nihilism\" that is \"so alien it requires the construction of a new tradition to make it comprehensible.\"\nGillespie extrapolates from Heidegger's writings that humankind may degenerate into \"scientists, workers, and brutes\". According to Gillespie, Heidegger envisaged this abyss to be the greatest event in the history of the West because it might enable humanity to comprehend being more profoundly and primordially than the Presocratics.\nThe poetry of Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin became an increasingly central focus of Heidegger's later work and thought. Heidegger grants H\u00f6lderlin a singular place within the history of being and the history of Germany, as a herald whose thought is yet to be \"heard\" in Germany or the West more generally. Many of Heidegger's works from the 1930s onwards include meditations on lines from H\u00f6lderlin's poetry, and several of the lecture courses are devoted to the reading of a single poem; for example, \"H\u00f6lderlin's Hymn \"The Ister\"\".\nHeidegger and the Nazi Party.\nThe rectorate.\nAdolf Hitler was sworn in as Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933. Heidegger was elected rector of the University of Freiburg on 21 April 1933, and assumed the position the following day. On 1 May, he joined the Nazi Party.\nBeginning in February 1933 Heidegger was active, alongside Ernst Krieck, in an organization known as the Cultural-Political W\"orking Group of German University Instructors (Kulturpolitische Arbeitsgemeinschaft deutscher Hochschullehrer\"). The group met privately in the Spring of 1933 to plan the Nazification of the German university system. \nOn 27 May 1933, Heidegger delivered his inaugural address, the \"Rektoratsrede\" (titled \"The Self-assertion of the German University\"), in a hall decorated with swastikas, with members of the Sturmabteilung (SA) and prominent Nazi Party officials present.\nThat summer he delivered a lecture on a fragment of Heraclitus (usually translated in English: \"War is the father of all\"). His notes on this lecture appear under the heading \"Struggle as the essence of Beings.\" In this lecture he suggests that if an enemy cannot be found for the people then one must be invented, and once conceptualized and identified, then the 'beings' who have discovered or invented this enemy must strive for the total annihilation of the enemy.\nHis tenure as rector was fraught with difficulties from the outset. Some Nazi education officials viewed him as a rival, while others saw his efforts as comical. Some of Heidegger's fellow Nazis also ridiculed his philosophical writings as gibberish. He finally offered his resignation as rector on 23 April 1934, and it was accepted on 27 April. Heidegger remained a member of both the academic faculty and of the Nazi Party until the end of the war.\nPhilosophical historian Hans Sluga wrote, \"Though as rector he prevented students from displaying an anti-Semitic poster at the entrance to the university and from holding a book burning, he kept in close contact with the Nazi student leaders and clearly signaled to them his sympathy with their activism.\"\nIn 1945, Heidegger wrote of his term as rector, giving the writing to his son Hermann; it was published in 1983:\nThe rectorate was an attempt to see something in the movement that had come to power, beyond all its failings and crudeness, that was much more far-reaching and that could perhaps one day bring a concentration on the Germans' Western historical essence. It will in no way be denied that at the time I believed in such possibilities and for that reason renounced the actual vocation of thinking in favor of being effective in an official capacity. In no way will what was caused by my own inadequacy in office be played down. But these points of view do not capture what is essential and what moved me to accept the rectorate.\nTreatment of Husserl.\nBeginning in 1917, German-Jewish philosopher Edmund Husserl championed Heidegger's work, and helped Heidegger become his successor for the chair in philosophy at the University of Freiburg in 1928.\nOn 6 April 1933, the Gauleiter of Baden Province, Robert Wagner, suspended all Jewish government employees, including present and retired faculty at the University of Freiburg. Heidegger's predecessor as rector formally notified Husserl of his \"enforced leave of absence\" on 14 April 1933.\nHeidegger became Rector of the University of Freiburg on 22 April 1933. The following week the national Reich law of 28 April 1933 replaced Reichskommissar Wagner's decree. The Reich law required the firing of Jewish professors from German universities, including those, such as Husserl, who had converted to Christianity. The termination of the retired professor Husserl's academic privileges thus did not involve any specific action on Heidegger's part.\nHeidegger had by then broken off contact with Husserl, other than through intermediaries. Heidegger later claimed that his relationship with Husserl had already become strained after Husserl publicly \"settled accounts\" with Heidegger and Max Scheler in the early 1930s.\nHeidegger did not attend his former mentor's cremation in 1938, for which he later declared himself regretful: \"That I failed to express again to Husserl my gratitude and respect for him upon the occasion of his final illness and death is a human failure that I apologized for in a letter to Mrs. Husserl.\" In 1941, under pressure from publisher Max Niemeyer, Heidegger agreed to remove the dedication to Husserl from \"Being and Time\" (restored in post-war editions).\nHeidegger's behavior towards Husserl has provoked controversy. Hannah Arendt initially suggested that Heidegger's behavior precipitated Husserl's death. She called Heidegger a \"potential murderer\". However, she later recanted her accusation.\nPost-rectorate period.\nAfter the failure of Heidegger's rectorship, he withdrew from most political activity, but remained a member of the Nazi Party. In May 1934 he accepted a position on the Committee for the Philosophy of Law in the Academy for German Law, where he remained active until at least 1936. The academy had official consultant status in preparing Nazi legislation such as the Nuremberg racial laws that came into effect in 1935. In addition to Heidegger, such Nazi notables as Hans Frank, Julius Streicher, Carl Schmitt, and Alfred Rosenberg belonged to the Academy and served on this committee.\nIn a 1935 lecture, later published in 1953 as part of the book \"Introduction to Metaphysics\", Heidegger refers to the \"inner truth and greatness\" of the Nazi movement, but he then adds a qualifying statement in parentheses: \"namely, the confrontation of planetary technology and modern humanity\". However, it subsequently transpired that this qualification had not been made during the original lecture, although Heidegger claimed that it had been. This has led scholars to argue that Heidegger still supported the Nazi party in 1935 but that he did not want to admit this after the war, and so he attempted to silently correct his earlier statement.\nIn private notes written in 1939, Heidegger took a strongly critical view of Hitler's ideology; however, in public lectures, he seems to have continued to make ambiguous comments which, if they expressed criticism of the regime, did so only in the context of praising its ideals. For instance, in a 1942 lecture, published posthumously, Heidegger said of recent German classics scholarship, \"In the majority of \"research results,\" the Greeks appear as pure National Socialists. This overenthusiasm on the part of academics seems not even to notice that with such \"results\" it does National Socialism and its historical uniqueness no service at all, not that it needs this anyhow.\"\nAn important witness to Heidegger's continued allegiance to Nazism during the post-rectorship period is his former student Karl L\u00f6with, who met Heidegger in 1936 while Heidegger was visiting Rome. In an account set down in 1940 (though not intended for publication), L\u00f6with recalled that Heidegger wore a swastika pin to their meeting, though Heidegger knew that L\u00f6with was Jewish. L\u00f6with also recalled that Heidegger \"left no doubt about his faith in Hitler\", and stated that his support for Nazism was in agreement with the essence of his philosophy.\nHeidegger rejected the \"biologically grounded racism\" of the Nazis, replacing it with linguistic-historical heritage.\nPost-war period.\nAfter the end of World War II, Heidegger was summoned to appear at a denazification hearing. He was charged on four counts, dismissed from the university and declared a \"follower\" (\"Mitl\u00e4ufer\") of Nazism. Heidegger was forbidden to teach between 1945 and 1951. One consequence of this teaching ban was that Heidegger began to engage far more in the French philosophical scene.\nIn his postwar thinking, Heidegger distanced himself from Nazism, but his critical comments about Nazism seem scandalous to some since they tend to equate the Nazi war atrocities with other inhumane practices related to rationalization and industrialisation, including the treatment of animals by factory farming. For instance in a lecture delivered at Bremen in 1949, Heidegger said: \"Agriculture is now a motorized food industry, the same thing in its essence as the production of corpses in the gas chambers and the extermination camps, the same thing as blockades and the reduction of countries to famine, the same thing as the manufacture of hydrogen bombs.\"\nIn 1967 Heidegger met with the Jewish poet Paul Celan, a concentration camp survivor. Having corresponded since 1956, Celan visited Heidegger at his country retreat and wrote an enigmatic poem about the meeting, which some interpret as Celan's wish for Heidegger to apologize for his behavior during the Nazi era.\nHeidegger's defenders, notably Arendt, see his support for Nazism as arguably a personal \" 'error' \" (a word which Arendt placed in quotation marks when referring to Heidegger's Nazi-era politics). Defenders think this error was irrelevant to Heidegger's philosophy. Critics such as Levinas, Karl L\u00f6with, and Theodor Adorno claim that Heidegger's support for Nazism revealed flaws inherent in his thought.\n\"Der Spiegel\" interview.\nOn 23 September 1966, Heidegger was interviewed by Georg Wolff, a former Nazi, and Rudolf Augstein for \"Der Spiegel\" magazine, in which he agreed to discuss his political past provided that the interview be published posthumously. (\"Only a God Can Save Us\" was published five days after his death, on 31 May 1976.) In the interview, Heidegger defended his entanglement with Nazism in two ways. First, he claimed that there was no alternative, saying that with his acceptance of the position of rector of the University of Freiburg he was trying to save the university (and science in general) from being politicized and thus had to compromise with the Nazi administration. Second, he admitted that he saw an \"awakening\" (\"Aufbruch\") which might help to find a \"new national and social approach,\" but said that he changed his mind about this in 1934, when he refused, under threat of dismissal, to remove from the position of dean of the faculty those who were not acceptable to the Nazi party, and he consequently decided to resign as rector.\nIn his interview Heidegger defended as double-speak his 1935 lecture describing the \"inner truth and greatness of this movement.\" He affirmed that Nazi informants who observed his lectures would understand that by \"movement\" he meant Nazism. However, Heidegger asserted that his dedicated students would know this statement was not praise for the Nazi Party. Rather, he meant it as he expressed it in the parenthetical clarification later added to \"Introduction to Metaphysics\" (1953), namely, \"the confrontation of planetary technology and modern humanity.\"\nThe eyewitness account of L\u00f6with from 1940, contradicts the account given in the \"Der Spiegel\" interview in two ways: that he did not make any decisive break with Nazism in 1934, and that Heidegger was willing to entertain more profound relations between his philosophy and political involvement. The \"Der Spiegel\" interviewers did not bring up Heidegger's 1949 quotation comparing the industrialization of agriculture to the extermination camps. In fact, the interviewers were not in possession of much of the evidence now known for Heidegger's Nazi sympathies. Furthermore, \"Der Spiegel\" journalist Georg Wolff had been an SS-Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer with the Sicherheitsdienst, stationed in Oslo during World War II, and had been writing articles with antisemitic and racist overtones in \"Der Spiegel\" since the end of the war.\nThe Far\u00edas debate.\nJacques Derrida, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard, among others, all engaged in debate and disagreement about the relation between Heidegger's philosophy and his Nazi politics. These debates included the question of whether it was possible to do without Heidegger's philosophy, a position which Derrida in particular rejected. Forums where these debates took place include the proceedings of the first conference dedicated to Derrida's work, published as \"\"Les Fins de l'homme \u00e0 partir du travail de Jacques Derrida: colloque de Cerisy, 23 juillet-2 ao\u00fbt 1980\", Derrida's \"Feu la cendre/cio' che resta del fuoco\"\", and the studies on Paul Celan by Lacoue-Labarthe and Derrida, which shortly preceded the detailed studies of Heidegger's politics published in and after 1987.\nThe Black Notebooks.\nIn 2014, Heidegger's \"Black Notebooks\", written between 1931 and the early 1970s, were published. The notebooks contain several examples of anti-Semitic sentiments, which have led to reevaluation of Heidegger's relation to Nazism. An example of Heidegger using anti-Semitic language was his writing, \"world Judaism is ungraspable everywhere and doesn't need to get involved in military action while continuing to unfurl its influence, whereas we are left to sacrifice the best blood of the best of our people\". The term and notion of \"world Judaism\" was first promoted by the anti-Semitic text The Protocols of the Elders of Zion and later appeared in Hitler's infamous book \"Mein Kampf\". In another instance, Heidegger wrote \"by living according to the principle of race [Jews] had themselves promoted the very reasoning by which they were now being attacked and so they had no right to complain when it was being used against them by the Germans promoting their own racial purity\". However, there are also instances of Heidegger writing critically of biological racism and biological oppression.\nA notable entry in the notebooks are his writings about his mentor and former friend Edmund Husserl, specifically relating to Husserl's Jewish heritage. In 1939, only a year after Husserl's death, Heidegger wrote in his \"Black Notebooks\":\nthe occasional increase in the power of Judaism is grounded in the fact that Western metaphysics, especially in\nits modern evolution, offered the point of attachment for the expansion of an otherwise empty rationality and calculative capacity, and these thereby created for themselves an abode in the \"spirit\" without ever being able, on their own, to grasp the concealed decisive domains. The more originary and inceptual the future decisions and questions become, all the more inaccessible will they remain to this 'race.' (Thus Husserl's step to the phenomenological attitude, taken in explicit opposition to psychological explanation and to the historiological calculation of opinions, will be of lasting importance\u2014and yet this attitude never reaches into the domains of the essential decisions[...].)\nFor Donatella Di Cesare, this seemed to imply that Heidegger considered Husserl to be philosophically limited by his Jewishness. Recent research confirms the deep connection between Heidegger's philosophy and \"v\u00f6lkisch\" antisemitism in the \"Black Notebooks\".\nPersonal life.\nHeidegger married Elfride Petri on 21 March 1917 in a Catholic ceremony officiated by his friend Engelbert Krebs, and a week later in a Protestant ceremony in the presence of her parents. Their first son, J\u00f6rg, was born in 1919. Elfride then gave birth to Hermann in August 1920. Heidegger knew that he was not Hermann's biological father, but raised him as his son. Hermann's biological father, who became godfather to his son, was family friend and doctor Friedel Caesar. Hermann was told of this at the age of 14; Hermann grew up to become a historian and would later serve as the executor of Heidegger's will. \nIn the same year that he married his wife, Heidegger began a decades-long correspondence with her friend Elisabeth Blochmann. Their letters are suggestive from the beginning, and it is certain they were romantically involved in the summer of 1929. Blochmann was Jewish, which raises questions in light of Heidegger's later membership in the Nazi Party.\nIn 1925, a 35-year-old Heidegger began what would be a four-year affair with Hannah Arendt, who was then 19 years old and his student. Like Blochmann, Arendt was Jewish. Heidegger and Arendt agreed to keep the details of the relationship a secret, preserving their letters, but keeping them unavailable. The affair was not widely known until 1995, when Elzbieta Ettinger gained access to the sealed correspondence. Nevertheless, Arendt faced criticism for her association with Heidegger after his election as rector at the University of Freiburg in 1933.\nHeidegger had an active social life and interacted with numerous influential philosophers and academics. During his career he established relationships with Karl Jaspers, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Paul Tillich, Rudolf Bultmann, and Hannah Arendt. He was a friend of political theorist Carl Schmitt both of whom joined the Nazi party in 1933 and served together on the Academy for German Law. \nDeath.\nHeidegger died on 26 May 1976 in Freiburg. A few months before his death, he met with Bernhard Welte, a Catholic priest, Freiburg University professor and earlier correspondent. The exact nature of their conversation is not known, but what is known is that it included talk of Heidegger's relationship to the Catholic Church and subsequent Christian burial at which Welte officiated. Heidegger was buried in the Me\u00dfkirch cemetery.\nReception.\nInfluence.\nHeidegger is often considered to be among the most important and influential philosophers of the 20th century by many observers. American Philosopher Richard Rorty has ranked Heidegger as among the most important philosophers along with John Dewey and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Simon Critchley has praised Heidegger as the \"most important and influential philosopher in the continental tradition in the 20th century\".\nSlovenian philosopher Slavoj \u017di\u017eek has referred to Heidegger as a \"great philosopher\" and rejected the notion that his alleged anti-semitism against him tainted his philosophy.\nIn France, there is a very long and particular history of reading and interpreting Heidegger's work. Because Heidegger's discussion of ontology is sometimes interpreted as rooted in an analysis of the mode of existence of individual human beings (Dasein), his work has often been associated with existentialism. Derrida sees deconstruction is a tradition inherited via Heidegger (the French term \"\"d\u00e9construction\" is a term coined to translate Heidegger's use of the words \"Destruktion\"\"\u2014literally \"destruction\"\u2014and \"Abbau\"\u2014more literally \"de-building\"). The influence of Heidegger on Sartre's 1943 \"Being and Nothingness\" is marked. Heidegger himself, however, argued that Sartre had misread his work.\nHubert Dreyfus introduced Heidegger's notion of \"being-in-the-world\" to research in Artificial intelligence. According to Dreyfus, long-standing research questions such as the Frame problem can be only dissolved within an Heideggerian framework. Heidegger also profoundly influenced Enactivism and Situated robotics. Former Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon has expressed admiration for Heidegger and has praised his philosophy.\nSome writers on Heidegger's work see possibilities within it for dialogue with traditions of thought outside of Western philosophy, particularly East Asian thinking. Despite perceived differences between Eastern and Western philosophy, some of Heidegger's later work, particularly \"A Dialogue on Language between a Japanese and an Inquirer\", does show an interest in initiating such a dialogue. Heidegger himself had contact with a number of leading Japanese intellectuals, including members of the Kyoto School, notably Hajime Tanabe and Kuki Sh\u016bz\u014d. The scholar Chang Chung-Yuan stated, \"Heidegger is the only Western Philosopher who not only intellectually understands Tao, but has intuitively experienced the essence of it as well.\" Philosopher Reinhard May sees great influence of Taoism and Japanese scholars in Heidegger's work, although this influence is not acknowledged by the author. He asserts it can be shown that Heidegger sometimes \"appropriated wholesale and almost verbatim major ideas from the German translations of Daoist and Zen Buddhist classics.\" To this he adds, \"This clandestine textual appropriation of non-Western spirituality, the extent of which has gone undiscovered for so long, seems quite unparalleled, with far-reaching implications for our future interpretation of Heidegger's work.\"\nNotable figures known to be influenced by Heidegger's work today include Aleksandr Dugin, a prominent Russian far-right political philosopher.\nCriticism.\nAccording to Husserl, \"Being and Time\" claimed to deal with ontology, but only did so in the first few pages of the book. Having nothing further to contribute to an ontology independent of human existence, Heidegger changed the topic to Dasein. Whereas Heidegger argued that the question of human existence is central to the pursuit of the question of being, Husserl criticized this as reducing phenomenology to \"philosophical anthropology\" and offering an abstract and incorrect portrait of the human being. Aspects of his work have been criticized by those who acknowledge his influence. Some questions raised about Heidegger's philosophy include the priority of ontology, the status of animals, the nature of the religious, Heidegger's supposed neglect of ethics (Emmanuel Levinas), the body (Maurice Merleau-Ponty), sexual difference (Luce Irigaray), and space (Peter Sloterdijk). A. J. Ayer objected that Heidegger proposed vast, overarching theories regarding existence that were completely unverifiable through empirical demonstration and logical analysis.\nIn 1929, the neo-Kantian Ernst Cassirer and Heidegger engaged in an influential debate, during the Second Davos Hochschulkurs in Davos, concerning the significance of Kantian notions of freedom and rationality. Whereas Cassirer defended the role of rationality in Kant, Heidegger argued for the priority of the imagination.The reception of Heidegger's philosophy by Anglo-American analytic philosophy, beginning with the logical positivists, was almost uniformly negative. Rudolf Carnap accused Heidegger of offering an \"illusory\" ontology, criticizing him for committing the fallacy of reification and for wrongly dismissing the logical treatment of language which, according to Carnap, can only lead to writing \"nonsensical pseudo-propositions\".\nHegelian-Marxist thinkers, especially Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs and the Frankfurt School, associated the style and content of Heidegger's thought with irrationalism and criticized its political implications. For instance, Theodor Adorno wrote an extended critique of the ideological character of Heidegger's early and later use of language in the \"Jargon of Authenticity\", and J\u00fcrgen Habermas admonishes the influence of Heidegger on recent French philosophy in his polemic against \"postmodernism\" in \"The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity\".\nBertrand Russell considered Heidegger an obscurantist, writing, \"Highly eccentric in its terminology, his philosophy is extremely obscure. One cannot help suspecting that language is here running riot. An interesting point in his speculations is the insistence that nothingness is something positive. As with much else in Existentialism, this is a psychological observation made to pass for logic.\" According to Richard Polt, this quote expresses the sentiments of many 20th-century analytic philosophers concerning Heidegger.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\nFor ease of reference, citations of \"Being and Time\" cite to the pagination of the standard German edition, which is included in the margins of both of the English translations, each of which has its virtues.\nHeidegger's collected writings are published by Vittorio Klostermann.

The political offense is not always the official reason for the prisoner's detention.\nThere is no internationally recognized legal definition of the concept, although numerous similar definitions have been proposed by various organizations and scholars, and there is a general consensus among scholars that \"individuals have been sanctioned by legal systems and imprisoned by political regimes not for their violation of codified laws but for their thoughts and ideas that have fundamentally challenged existing power relations\". The status of a political prisoner is generally awarded to individuals based on the declarations of non-governmental organizations like Amnesty International, on a case-by-case basis. While such statuses are often widely recognized by the international public, they are often rejected by individual governments accused of holding political prisoners, which tend to deny any bias in their judicial systems.\nA related term is prisoner of conscience (POC), popularized by Amnesty International. It describes someone who was prosecuted because of their personal beliefs.\nSome prisons, known as political prisons, are accustomed to or are designed solely for hosting political prisoners.\nDefinitions.\nThe concept of a political prisoner, like many concepts in social sciences, sports numerous definitions, and is undefined in international law and human right treaties. Helen Taylor Greene and Shaun L. Gabbidon in 2009 that \"standard legal definitions have remained elusive\", but at the same time, observing that there is a general consensus that \"individuals have been sanctioned by legal systems and imprisoned by political regimes not for their violation of codified laws but for their thoughts and ideas that have fundamentally challenged existing power relations\".\nA number of organizations involved in human rights issues, as well as scholars studying them, have developed their own definitions, some of which are presented below.\nOrganizations.\nAmnesty International.\nAmnesty International (AI) campaigns for the release of prisoners of conscience, which include both political prisoners as well as those imprisoned for their religious or philosophical beliefs. To reduce controversy, and as a matter of principle, the organization's policy applies only to prisoners who have not committed or advocated violence. Thus, there are political prisoners who do not fit the narrower criteria for POCs. The organisation defines the differences as follows:\nAI uses the term \"political prisoner\" broadly. It does not use it, as some others do, to imply that all such prisoners have a special status or should be released. It uses the term only to define a category of prisoners for whom AI demands a fair and prompt trial.\nIn AI's usage, the term includes any prisoner whose case contains a significant political element, in regard to the motivation of the prisoner's acts, the acts themselves, or the motivation of the authorities.\n\"Political\" is used by AI to refer to aspects of human relations related to \"politics\": the mechanisms of society and civil order, the principles, organization, or conduct of government or public affairs, and the relation of all these to questions of language, ethnic origin, sex or religion, status, or influence (among other factors).\nThe category of political prisoners embraces the category of prisoners of conscience, the only prisoners who AI demands should be immediately and unconditionally released, as well as people who resort to criminal violence for a political motive.\nIn AI's use of the term, here are some examples of political prisoners:\nGovernments often say they have no political prisoners, only prisoners held under the normal criminal law. AI however describes cases like the examples given above as \"political\" and uses the terms \"political trial\" and \"political imprisonment\" when referring to them. But by doing so, AI does not oppose the imprisonment, except where it further maintains that the prisoner is a prisoner of conscience, or condemn the trial, except where it concludes that it was unfair.\nParliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.\nThe Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has the following definition:\nA person deprived of their personal liberty is to be regarded as a 'political prisoner':\nAssistance Association for Political Prisoners.\nBurmese Assistance Association for Political Prisoners defines a political prisoner as \"anyone who is arrested because of [their] perceived or real involvement in or supporting role in opposition movements with peaceful or resistance means\".\nCongressional-Executive Commission on China.\nThe US Congressional-Executive Commission on China defines a political prisoner broadly as any individual who is detained for exercising their \"human rights under international law, such as peaceable assembly, freedom of religion, freedom of association, free expression, including the freedom to advocate peaceable social or political change, and to criticize government policy or government officials.\"\nAcademics.\nSteinert (2020).\nChristoph Valentin Steinert, who in 2020 reviewed 366 definitions of political prisoners used in (mainly English language) academic literature in 1956 and 2019, argued that any definition of political prisoner needs to avoid focusing on prisoners' individual motivations and that the term \"should be exclusively reserved for victims of politically biased trials\" (in other words, \"victims of state repression\"), to avoid delegitimizing the term by diluting it with applications to prisoners of any possibly politically motivated action (which on the extreme end of the spectrum would include, for example, Ku Klux Klanners, neo-Nazis, and jihadist terrorists). He specifically criticizes definitions of political prisoners as \"individuals imprisoned for politically motivated actions\" or \"committing a political offense\". He proposed the following definition:\nPolitical prisoners are defined as individuals that are convicted and incarcerated in politically biased trials (or executive decisions in the absence of any trials). Trials are deemed politically biased if they are endorsed by the government and (a) lack a domestic legal basis, (b) violate principles of procedural justice, or (c) violate universal human rights.\nSteinert noted that his definition does extend to prisoners \"imprisoned for nonpolitical identities such as their religious beliefs or their sexual orientations\", as well as individuals engaged in violent actions, arguing that the neutral \"classification as a political prisoner neither entails an a priori judgment about the moral legitimacy of prisoners' actions nor does it imply that individuals committed politically motivated crimes\".\nOther aspects.\nThe purpose of political prisons and of imprisoning dissidents is to demonstrate the strength of the regime to the dissidents. The regime's opponents are isolated, and stigmatised, frequently abused, and tortured. The goal of such treatment is not just to punish those opposing the regime, but to frighten those who consider opposing the regime by demonstrating the power of the regime by sending a clear warning that objecting is not tolerated, and that the regime is well prepared and ready to punish the objectors through the creation of total institutions dedicated to hosting political prisoners.\nThe status of a political prisoner is conveyed to one only after their detention. Before that, potential political prisoners may be referred to as \"dissidents, revolutionaries, social reformers, or radical thinkers\". The nature of the behavior that leads to political imprisonment is hard to define and can be roughly described as any \"activity deemed questionable by ruling elites\". Therefore, political prisoners may be officially detained and sentenced for a multitude of different transgressions, rather than a single well-defined crime. Political prisoners are frequently arrested and tried with a veneer of legality where false criminal charges, manufactured evidence, and unfair trials (kangaroo courts, show trials) are used to disguise the fact that an individual is a political prisoner. For example, AAPP states that \"the motivation behind the arrest of every individual in AAPP's database is political, regardless of the laws they have been sentenced under\". This is common in situations which may otherwise be decried nationally and internationally as a human rights violation or suppression of a political dissident. Steinert notes that \"objective evidence about politically biased imprisonments is chronically sparse considering that governments face substantial incentives to hide repressive practices\". As a rule, governments deny imprisoning individuals for their political activities.\nA political prisoner can also be someone who has been denied bail unfairly, denied parole when it would reasonably have been given to a prisoner charged with a comparable crime, or special powers may be invoked by the judiciary. Particularly in this latter situation, whether an individual is regarded as a political prisoner may depend upon the subjective political perspective or interpretation of the evidence. Political prisoners can also be imprisoned with no legal veneer by extrajudicial processes or even through executive decisions in the absence of any trials or charges. Some political prisoners need not be imprisoned at all, as they can be subject to prolonged pre-trial detainment instead. Steinert noted that technically, political detainees should be distinguished from political prisoners, but they are often grouped together, and in practical terms, he recommends treating them as \"special types\" of political prisoners. Examples of such detainees can include individuals such as the former Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, detained for many years without a trial. Likewise, supporters of Tibetan spiritual leader Gedhun Choekyi Nyima in the 11th Panchen Lama controversy have called him a \"political prisoner\", despite the fact that he is not accused of a political offense. He is held under secluded house arrest.\nPolitical prisoners may become the subjects of international advocacy and receive aid from various non-governmental organizations. Criticism from the international public opinion has been shown to facilitate the release of political detainees, or reduce their sentences, but is less effective in securing the release of already-sentenced individuals. When the status of political prisoner is well known, it can be seen as a form of status symbol. Some political prisoners purposefully frame themselves as \"the imprisoned martyrs and leaders of their movement.\" Which can safeguard their well-being in prison.\nHistory.\nAncient Greek philosopher Socrates has been described as perhaps the earliest known political prisoner; imprisoned for allegedly \"poisoning\" the minds of Grecian youth through his critique of Athenian society and its rulers. Early Christians, including Jesus Christ, and St. Peter, have also been described as such. Another famous historical figure described as a political prisoner is the 15th century French heroine, Joan of Arc, whose final charge of heresy was seen as a legal justification for her real crime of \"inconveniencing the elites\".\nPadraic Kenney noted that \"the emergence of modern political prisoners coincides with a fifty-year period (1860s\u20131910s) during which [modern] political movements matured around the world\", also defining such movements as having \"clearly articulated political and social programs\" which forced the governments to develop a specific response to such movements (a response which often involved incarceration rather than dialogue, particularly under the less liberal regimes).\nIn some places, political prisoners had their own customs, traditions, and semi-formal organizations and privileges; historically, this has been more common up to around the interwar period, as the many political prisoners came from higher social classes (in particular, nobility), and authorities often treated them better than common criminals. This changed with the emergence of the totalitarian regimes that were intent on annihilating the opposition.\nIn Poland, the concept and even traditions of political prisoners emerged around the second half of the 19th century in the Russian partition.\nWhile the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 is not legally binding, it is generally recognized as \"a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations\". Of particular relevance to political prisoners are its Articles 5, 6, 9 and 18. The UDHR and the later Helsinki Accords of 1975 have been used by a number of nongovernmental organizations as the basis for arguing that some governments are in fact holding political prisoners.\nIn the United States, the term political prisoner has been used during the mid-20th century civil rights struggle and has been occasionally applied to individuals like Rosa Parks or Martin Luther King Jr., and later used for individuals imprisoned for objecting to US involvement in the Vietnam War.\nPolitical prisoners sometimes write memoirs of their experiences and resulting insights. Some of these memoirs have become important political texts. For example, King's \"Letter From a Birmingham City Jail\" has been described as \"one of the most important historical documents penned by a modern political prisoner\".\nAdvocacy.\nA number of nongovernmental organizations focus on advocacy for political prisoners. The most prominent of those is Amnesty International, founded in 1961.\nNotable political prisoners.\nIndividuals.\nDue to the lack of a single, internationally recognized legal definition of a political prisoner, nongovernmental organizations like Amnesty International, aided by legal scholars, determine whether prisoners meet their criteria of political prisoners on a case-by-case basis.\nNotable political prisons.\nThe following prisons have been recognized as incarcerating primarily political prisoners and have therefore been called \"political prisons\":\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the founder of Jeet Kune Do, a hybrid martial arts philosophy which was formed from Lee's experiences in unarmed fighting and self-defense\u2014as well as eclectic, Zen Buddhist and Taoist philosophies\u2014as a new school of martial arts thought. With a film career spanning Hong Kong and the United States, Lee is regarded as the first global Chinese film star and one of the most influential martial artists in the history of cinema. Known for his roles in five feature-length martial arts films, Lee is credited with helping to popularize martial arts films in the 1970s and promoting Hong Kong action cinema.\nBorn in San Francisco and raised in British Hong Kong, Lee was introduced to the Hong Kong film industry as a child actor by his father Lee Hoi-chuen. His early martial arts experience included Wing Chun (trained under Ip Man), tai chi, boxing (winning a Hong Kong boxing tournament), and frequent street fighting (neighborhood and rooftop fights). In 1959, Lee moved to Seattle, where he enrolled at the University of Washington in 1961. It was during this time in the United States that he began considering making money by teaching martial arts, even though he aspired to have a career in acting. He opened his first martial arts school, operated out of his home in Seattle. After later adding a second school in Oakland, California, he once drew significant attention at the 1964 Long Beach International Karate Championships of California by making demonstrations and speaking. He subsequently moved to Los Angeles to teach, where his students included Chuck Norris, Sharon Tate, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\nHis roles in America, including playing Kato in \"The Green Hornet\", introduced him to American audiences. After returning to Hong Kong in 1971, Lee landed his first leading role in \"The Big Boss\", directed by Lo Wei. A year later he starred in \"Fist of Fury\", in which he portrayed Chen Zhen, and \"The Way of the Dragon\", directed and written by Lee. He went on to star in the American-Hong Kong co-production \"Enter the Dragon\" (1973) and \"The Game of Death\" (1978). His Hong Kong and Hollywood-produced films, all of which were commercially successful, elevated Hong Kong martial arts films to a new level of popularity and acclaim, sparking a surge of Western interest in Chinese martial arts. The direction and tone of his films, including their fight choreography and diversification, dramatically influenced and changed martial arts and martial arts films worldwide. With his influence, kung fu films began to displace the wuxia film genre\u2014fights were choreographed more realistically, fantasy elements were discarded for real-world conflicts, and the characterisation of the male lead went from simply being a chivalrous hero to one that embodied the notion of masculinity.\nLee's career was cut short by his sudden death at age 32 from a brain edema, the causes of which remain a matter of dispute. Nevertheless, his films remained popular, gained a large cult following, and became widely imitated and exploited. He became an iconic figure known throughout the world, particularly among the Chinese, based upon his portrayal of Cantonese culture in his films, and among Asian Americans for defying Asian stereotypes in the United States. Even after his death, Lee has continued to be a prominent influence on modern combat sports, including judo, karate, mixed martial arts, and boxing, as well as modern popular culture, including film, television, comics, animation, and video games. \"Time\" named Lee one of the .\nEarly life.\nBruce Lee's birth name was Lee Jun-fan.\nHis father, Lee Hoi-chuen, was a Cantonese opera singer based in Hong Kong. His mother Grace Ho was born in Shanghai. In December 1939, his parents traveled to California for an international opera tour in Chinatown, San Francisco. Bruce was born there on November 27, 1940. His birth in the U.S. allowed him to claim U.S. citizenship due to the United States' \"jus soli\" citizenship laws. When he was four months old (April 1941), the Lee family returned to Hong Kong. Soon after, the Lee family experienced unexpected hardships as Japan, amid World War II, launched a surprise attack on Hong Kong in December 1941 and ruled the city for the next four years.\nThe ethnicity of Bruce Lee's mother, Grace Ho, is contested. The traditional consensus is that Grace Ho's father was a German immigrant, and that her mother was Chinese, as attested by biographers Robert Clouse and Bruce Thomas. Bruce Lee's wife, Linda Lee Cadwell, wrote that Bruce Lee's grandfather was a German Catholic.\nA new alternative theory argues that Grace Ho's father was actually the son of a Dutch Jew, Charles Maurice Bosman, and his Chinese concubine. Charles Russo has questioned this origin story entirely, suggesting that Grace Ho's father might have been Chinese or mixed-Chinese, and that her mother might have been English. Matthew Polly concedes that Grace Ho's paternal grandfather was a Dutch Jew, but likewise asserts that her mother was English.\nHowever, according to Doug Palmer, the claim that Grace Ho had an English mother is only speculation. Palmer also notes that family records suggest that the Dutch-Jewish Bosman family had originated from Germany, which may account for the assumption that Grace Ho was part German.\nCareer and education.\n1940\u20131958: Early roles, schooling and martial arts initiation.\nLee's father was a Cantonese opera star. As a result, Junior Lee was introduced to the world of cinema at a very young age and appeared in several films as a child. Lee had his first role as a baby who was carried onto the stage in the film \"Golden Gate Girl\". He took his Chinese stage name as \u674e\u5c0f\u9f8d, lit. \"Lee the Little Dragon\", for the fact that he was born in both the hour and the year of the Dragon by the Chinese zodiac.\nAt age seven, Lee began practicing tai chi together with his father. As a nine-year-old, he co-starred with his father in \"The Kid\" in 1950, which was based on a comic book character, \"Kid Cheung\", and was his first leading role. By the time he was 18, he had appeared in 20 films. After attending Tak Sun School (; several blocks from his home at 218 Nathan Road, Kowloon), Lee entered the primary school division of the Catholic La Salle College at age 12.\nIn the early 1950s, Lee's father became an opium addict. In 1956, due to poor academic performance (and possibly poor conduct), Lee was transferred to St. Francis Xavier's College. He was mentored by Brother Edward Muss, F.M.S., a Bavarian-born teacher and coach of the school boxing team.\nIn 1953, Lee's friend William Cheung introduced him to Ip Man. According to Cheung, Lee's European background on his mother's side led him to be rejected, initially, from learning Wing Chun kung fu under Ip Man because of the long-standing rule in the Chinese martial arts world not to teach foreigners. Cheung spoke on his behalf and Lee was accepted into the school and began training in Wing Chun with Ip Man. Ip tried to keep his students from fighting in the street gangs of Hong Kong by encouraging them to fight in organized competitions.\nAfter a year of his training with Ip Man, most of the other students refused to train with Lee. They had learned of his mixed ancestry, and the Chinese were generally against teaching their martial arts techniques to non-Asians. Lee's sparring partner, Hawkins Cheung, states, \"Probably fewer than six people in the whole Wing Chun clan were personally taught, or even partly taught, by Ip Man\". However, Lee showed a keen interest in Wing Chun and continued to train privately with Ip Man, William Cheung, and Wong Shun-leung.\nIn 1958, Lee won the Hong Kong schools boxing tournament, knocking out the previous champion, Gary Elms, in the final. That year, Lee who was also a good cha-cha dancer, won Hong Kong's Crown Colony Cha-Cha Championship.\n1959\u20131964: Move to Seattle.\nIn his late teens, Lee's street fights became more frequent and included beating the son of a feared triad family. In 1958, after students from a rival Choy Li Fut martial arts school challenged Lee's Wing Chun school, he engaged in a fight on a rooftop. In response to an unfair punch by another boy, he beat him so badly that one of his teeth was knocked out, leading to the boy's parents making a complaint to the police.\nLee's mother had to go to a police station and sign a document saying that she would take full responsibility for his actions if they released him into her custody. Though she did not mention the incident to her husband, she suggested that her son return to the United States to claim his U.S. citizenship at the age of 18. Lee's father agreed as Lee's college prospects were not very promising if he remained in Hong Kong.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The police detective came and said, \"Excuse me, Mr. Lee, your son is really fighting bad in school. If he gets into just one more fight I might have to put him in jail\".\nIn April 1959, Lee's parents decided to send him to the United States to stay with his older sister, Agnes Lee (), who was already living with family friends in San Francisco. After several months, he moved to Seattle in 1959 to continue his high school education, where he also worked for Ruby Chow as a live-in waiter at her restaurant. Chow's husband was a co-worker and friend of Lee's father. Lee's elder brother Peter Lee () joined him in Seattle for a short stay, before moving on to Minnesota to attend college.\nIn 1959, Lee started to teach martial arts. He called what he taught Jun Fan Gung Fu (literally Bruce Lee's Kung Fu). It was his approach to Wing Chun. Lee taught friends he met in Seattle, starting with Judo practitioner Jesse Glover, who continued to teach some of Lee's early techniques. Lee's early student group was the most racially diverse group of practitioners of Chinese martial arts until that time. During this time period, Lee invented his one-inch punch. He also became interested in boxing and the techniques of Muhammad Ali and Sugar Ray Robinson.\nTaky Kimura became Lee's first assistant instructor and continued to teach his art and philosophy after Lee's death. Lee opened his first martial arts school, named the Lee Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute, in Seattle.\nLee completed his high school education and received his diploma from Edison Technical School on Capitol Hill in Seattle.\nIn March 1961, Lee enrolled at the University of Washington. Despite what Lee himself and many others have stated, Lee's official major was drama rather than philosophy, according to a 1999 article in the university's alumni publication. In his junior year, he took two classes in psychology and two classes in philosophy; both of these became core interests for him for the rest of his life. He socialized with wealthy young people, but lived in relative poverty and worked as a dishwasher in a Chinese restaurant.\n1964\u20131965: Oakland.\nLee dropped out of university in early 1964 and moved to Oakland to live with James Yimm Lee. James Lee was twenty years senior to Lee and a well-known Chinese martial artist in the area. Together, they founded the second Jun Fan martial arts studio in Oakland. James Lee was responsible for introducing Lee to Ed Parker, an American martial artist. At the invitation of Parker, Lee appeared in the 1964 Long Beach International Karate Championships. He performed repetitions of two-finger push-ups, using the thumb and the index finger of one hand, with feet at approximately shoulder-width apart.\nIn the same Long Beach event, he also performed the \"one-inch punch\". Lee stood upright, his right foot forward with knees bent slightly, in front of a standing, stationary partner. Lee's right arm was partly extended and his right fist was approximately away from the partner's chest. Without retracting his right arm, Lee then forcibly delivered the punch to volunteer Bob Baker while largely maintaining his posture. This sent Baker backward and falling into a chair placed behind Baker to prevent injury, though Baker's momentum caused him to fall to the floor. Baker recalled, \"I told Bruce not to do this type of demonstration again. When he punched me that last time, I had to stay home from work because the pain in my chest was unbearable\". It was at the 1964 championships that Lee first met Taekwondo master Jhoongoo Rhee. The two developed a friendship\u2014 a relationship from which they benefited as martial artists. Rhee taught Lee the side kick in detail, and Lee taught Rhee the \"non-telegraphic\" punch.\nAt the Long Beach event, he also publicly criticized a number of classical karate and kung fu styles and argued for modernizing martial arts. This was a highly controversial presentation that convinced some spectators, while offending others. Subsequently, he appeared at the Sun Sing Theatre to present his new approach to the Chinatown, Oakland, community. More traditional kung fu practitioners took Lee's claims as an open challenge.\nIn 1964, Lee had a controversial private match with Wong Jack-man. Jack-man was a direct student of Ma Kin Fung, known for his mastery of Xingyiquan, Northern Shaolin, and tai chi. According to Lee, the Chinese community issued an ultimatum to him to stop teaching non-Chinese people. When he refused to comply, he was challenged to a combat match with Wong. The arrangement was that if Lee lost, he would have to shut down his school, while if he won, he would be free to teach white people, or anyone else. Wong denied this, stating that he requested to fight Lee after Lee boasted during one of his demonstrations at a Chinatown theater that he could beat anyone in San Francisco, and that Wong himself did not discriminate against whites or other non-Chinese people. Lee commented, \"That paper had all the names of the sifu from Chinatown, but they don't scare me\". Individuals known to have witnessed the match include Cadwell, James Lee (Bruce Lee's associate, no relation), and William Chen, a teacher of tai chi.\nWong and William Chen stated that the fight lasted an unusually long 20\u201325 minutes. Wong claims that although he had originally expected a serious but polite bout, Lee aggressively attacked him with the intent to kill. When Wong presented the traditional handshake, Lee appeared to accept the greeting, but instead, Lee allegedly thrust his hand as a spear aimed at Wong's eyes. Forced to defend his life, Wong asserted that he refrained from striking Lee with killing force when the opportunity presented itself because it could have earned him a prison sentence, but used illegal cufflings under his sleeves. According to Michael Dorgan's 1980 book \"Bruce Lee's Toughest Fight\", the fight ended due to Lee's \"unusually winded\" condition, as opposed to a decisive blow by either fighter.\nHowever, according to Bruce Lee, Linda Lee Cadwell, and James Yimm Lee, the fight lasted a mere three minutes with a decisive victory for Lee. In Cadwell's account, \"The fight ensued, it was a no-holds-barred fight, it took three minutes. Bruce got this guy down to the ground and said 'Do you give up?' and the man said he gave up.\" A couple of weeks after the bout, Lee gave an interview claiming that he had defeated an unnamed challenger, which Wong says was an obvious reference to him.\nIn response, Wong published his account of the fight in the \"Pacific Weekly\", a Chinese-language newspaper in San Francisco, with an invitation to a public rematch if Lee was not satisfied with the account. Lee did not respond to the invitation despite his reputation for violently responding to every provocation. There were no further public announcements by either, though Lee continued to teach non-Chinese people. Lee was unhappy with the outcome of the fight, and the experience led him to pursue further innovations in his personal style of martial arts.\nLee had abandoned thoughts of a film career in favor of pursuing martial arts. However, a martial arts exhibition in Long Beach in 1964 eventually led to the invitation by television producer William Dozier for an audition for a role in the pilot for \"Number One Son\" about Lee Chan, the son of Charlie Chan. The show never materialized, but Dozier saw potential in Lee.\n1966\u20131970: American roles and creating Jeet Kune Do.\nFrom 1966 to 1967, Lee played the role of Kato alongside the title character played by Van Williams in the TV series produced and narrated by William Dozier titled \"The Green Hornet\", based on the radio show by the same name. The show ran for one season (26 episodes) from September 1966 to March 1967. Lee and Williams also appeared as their characters in three crossover episodes of \"Batman\", another William Dozier-produced television series.\n\"The Green Hornet\" introduced the adult Bruce Lee to an American audience and became the first popular American show presenting Asian-style martial arts. The show's director wanted Lee to fight in the typical American style using fists and punches. As a professional martial artist, Lee refused, insisting that he should fight in the style of his expertise. At first, Lee moved so fast that his movements could not be caught on film, so he had to slow them down. The American martial arts community promoted the TV show and viewed Lee as their first mainstream star.\nDuring the show's production, Lee became friends with Gene LeBell, who worked as a stuntman in the show. The two trained together and exchanged martial arts knowledge from their respective specialties. After the show was canceled in 1967, Lee wrote to Dozier thanking him for starting \"my career in show business\".\nAfter filming one season of \"The Green Hornet\", Lee found himself out of work and opened the Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute in Chinatown, Los Angeles. The controversial match with Wong Jack-man influenced Lee's philosophy about martial arts. Lee concluded that the fight had lasted too long and that he had failed to live up to his potential using his Wing Chun techniques. He took the view that traditional martial arts techniques were too rigid and formalized to be practical in scenarios of chaotic street fighting. Lee decided to develop a system with an emphasis on \"practicality, flexibility, speed, and efficiency\". He started to use different methods of training such as weight training for strength, running for endurance, stretching for flexibility, and many others which he constantly adapted, including fencing and basic boxing techniques.\nJeet Kune Do originated in 1967. The name means \"way of the intercepting fist\" in Cantonese. This was a new hybrid system that took footwork from boxing, kicks from kung fu, and technique from fencing. Lee emphasized what he called \"the style of no style\". This consisted of getting rid of the formalized approach which Lee claimed was indicative of traditional styles. Lee felt that even the system he now called Jun Fan Gung Fu was too restrictive, and it eventually evolved into a philosophy and martial art he would come to call \"Jeet Kune Do\" or the \"Way of the Intercepting Fist.\" It is a term he would later regret, because Jeet Kune Do implied specific parameters that styles connote, whereas the idea of his martial art was to exist outside of parameters and limitations.\nAt the time, two of Lee's martial arts students were Hollywood script writer Stirling Silliphant and actor James Coburn. In 1969, the three worked on a script for a film titled \"The Silent Flute\", and they went together on a location hunt to India. The project was not realized at the time, but the 1978 film \"Circle of Iron\", starring David Carradine, was based on the same plot. In 2010, producer Paul Maslansky was reported to have planned and received funding for a film based on the original script for \"The Silent Flute\".\nIn 1969, Lee made a brief appearance in the Silliphant-penned film \"Marlowe\", where he played a hoodlum hired to intimidate private detective Philip Marlowe, played by James Garner, who uses his martial arts abilities to commit acts of vandalization to intimidate Marlowe. The same year, he was credited as the karate advisor in \"The Wrecking Crew\", the fourth installment of the Matt Helm comedy spy-fi film starring Dean Martin. Also that year, Lee acted in one episode of \"Here Come the Brides\" and \"Blondie\".\nIn 1970, Lee was responsible for producing the fight choreography of \"A Walk in the Spring Rain\", starring Ingrid Bergman and Anthony Quinn, again written by Silliphant.\n1971\u20131973: Hong Kong films, stardom, and Hollywood breakthrough.\nIn 1971, Lee appeared in four episodes of the television series \"Longstreet\", written by Silliphant. Lee played Li Tsung, the martial arts instructor of the title character Mike Longstreet, played by James Franciscus, and important aspects of his martial arts philosophy were written into the script. According to statements made by Lee, and also by Linda Lee Cadwell after Lee's death, Lee pitched a television series of his own in 1971, tentatively titled \"The Warrior\", discussions of which were confirmed by Warner Bros. During a December 9, 1971, television interview on \"The Pierre Berton Show\", Lee stated that both Paramount and Warner Bros. wanted him \"to be in a modernized type of a thing and that they think the Western idea is out, whereas I want to do the Western\".\nAccording to Cadwell, Lee's concept was retooled and renamed \"Kung Fu\", but Warner Bros. gave Lee no credit. Warner Bros. states that they had for some time been developing an identical concept, created by two writers and producers, Ed Spielman and Howard Friedlander in 1969, as stated too by Lee's biographer Matthew Polly. According to these sources, the reason Lee was not cast was because he had a thick accent, but Fred Weintraub attributes that to his ethnicity.\nThe role of the Shaolin monk in the Kung Fu was eventually awarded to then-non-martial artist David Carradine. In an interview with \"The Pierre Berton Show\", Lee stated he understood Warner Bros.' attitudes towards casting in the series: \"They think that business-wise it is a risk. I don't blame them. If the situation were reversed, and an American star were to come to Hong Kong, and I was the man with the money, I would have my own concerns as to whether the acceptance would be there\".\nProducer Fred Weintraub had advised Lee to return to Hong Kong and make a feature film that he could showcase to executives in Hollywood. Not happy with his supporting roles in the US, Lee returned to Hong Kong. Unaware that \"The Green Hornet\" had been played to success in Hong Kong and was unofficially referred to as \"The Kato Show\", he was surprised to be recognized as the star of the show. After negotiating with both Shaw Brothers Studio and Golden Harvest, Lee signed a film contract to star in two films produced by Golden Harvest.\nLee played his first leading role in \"The Big Boss\" (1971), which proved to be an enormous box-office success across Asia and catapulted him to instant stardom in Hong Kong. He followed up with \"Fist of Fury\" (1972), which broke the box office records set previously by \"The Big Boss\", with film critic Blake Howard writing that Lee was \"cresting the wave of international super-stardom\". Having finished his initial two-year contract, Lee negotiated a new deal with Golden Harvest. Lee later formed his own company, Concord Production Inc., with Chow. For his third film, \"The Way of the Dragon\" (1972), he was given complete control of the film's production as the writer, director, star, and choreographer of the fight scenes. In 1964, at a demonstration in Long Beach, California, Lee met karate champion Chuck Norris. In \"The Way of the Dragon\" Lee introduced Norris to moviegoers as his opponent. Their showdown has been characterized as \"one of the best fight scenes in martial arts and film history\". \"Fist of Fury\" and \"Way of the Dragon\" grossed an estimated US$ and US$ worldwide, respectively.\nFrom August to October 1972, Lee began work on his fourth Golden Harvest film, \"Game of Death\". He began filming some scenes, including his fight sequence with American basketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, a former student. Production stopped in November 1972 when Warner Bros. offered Lee the opportunity to star in \"Enter the Dragon\", the first film to be produced jointly by Concord, Golden Harvest, and Warner Bros. Filming began in Hong Kong in February 1973 and was completed in April 1973.\nOne month into the filming, another production company, Starseas Motion Pictures, promoted Lee as a leading actor in \"Fist of Unicorn\", although he had merely agreed to choreograph the fight sequences in the film as a favor to his long-time friend Unicorn Chan. Lee planned to sue the production company but retained his friendship with Chan. However, only a few months after the completion of \"Enter the Dragon\", and six days before its July 26, 1973, release, Lee died.\n\"Enter the Dragon\" went on to become one of the year's highest-grossing films and cemented Lee as a martial arts legend. It was made for US$850,000 in 1973, the equivalent of $4\u00a0million adjusted for inflation as of 2007. \"Enter the Dragon\" is estimated to have grossed over $ worldwide, the equivalent of over $ adjusted for inflation as of 2022[ [update]]. The film sparked a brief fad in martial arts, epitomized in songs such as \"Kung Fu Fighting\" and some TV shows.\n1978\u2013present: Posthumous work.\n Robert Clouse, the director of \"Enter the Dragon\", together with Golden Harvest, revived Lee's unfinished film \"Game of Death\". Lee had shot over 100 minutes of footage, including outtakes, for \"Game of Death\" before shooting was stopped to allow him to work on \"Enter the Dragon\". In addition to Abdul-Jabbar, George Lazenby, Hapkido master Ji Han-jae, and another of Lee's students, Dan Inosanto, appeared in the film, which culminated in Lee's character, Hai Tien, clad in a yellow tracksuit taking on a series of different challengers on each floor as they make their way through a five-level pagoda.\nIn a controversial move, Robert Clouse finished the film using a Lee look-alike (Kim Tai Chung, with Yuen Biao as a stunt double) and archive footage of Lee from his other films with a new storyline and cast. It was released in 1978. The cobbled-together film contained only fifteen minutes of actual footage of Lee. The unused footage Lee had filmed was recovered 22 years later and included in the documentary \"\".\nIn 1972, after the success of \"The Big Boss\" and \"Fist of Fury\", a third film was planned by Raymond Chow at Golden Harvest to be directed by Lo Wei, titled \"Yellow-Faced Tiger\". However, at the time, Lee decided to direct and produce his script for \"Way of the Dragon\" instead. Although Lee had formed a production company with Raymond Chow, a period film was also planned from September\u2013November 1973 with the competing Shaw Brothers Studio, to be directed by either Chor Yuen or Cheng Kang, and written by Yi Kang and Chang Cheh, titled \"The Seven Sons of the Jade Dragon\".\nIn 2015, Perfect Storm Entertainment and Bruce Lee's daughter, Shannon Lee, announced that the series \"The Warrior\" would be produced and would air on Cinemax. Filmmaker Justin Lin was chosen to direct the series. Production began in October 2017, in Cape Town, South Africa. In April 2019, Cinemax renewed the series for a second season. The series ended after three seasons, in 2023.\nIn March 2021, it was announced that producer Jason Kothari had acquired the rights to \"The Silent Flute\" \"to become a miniseries, which would have John Fusco as a screenwriter and executive producer.\nUnproduced works.\nLee had also worked on several scripts himself. A tape containing a recording of Lee narrating the basic storyline to a film tentatively titled \"Southern Fist/Northern Leg\" exists, showing some similarities with the canned script for \"The Silent Flute\" (\"Circle of Iron\"). Another script had the title \"Green Bamboo Warrior\", set in San Francisco, planned to co-star Bolo Yeung and to be produced by Andrew Vajna. Photoshoot costume tests were organized for some of these planned film projects.\nMartial arts and fitness.\nLee's films are known for popularising the side kick, roundhouse kick, grappling, spinning heel kick, armbar, weapons such as the nunchaku, and his distinctive \"kiai\". Lee was also known for popularising the one-inch punch and the two-finger push-up.\nStriking.\nLee's first introduction to martial arts was through his father, from whom he learned the fundamentals of Wu-style tai chi. In his teens, Lee became involved in Hong Kong gang conflicts, which led to frequent street fights. The largest influence on Lee's martial arts development was his study of Wing Chun. Lee was 16 years old under the Wing Chun teacher Ip Man, between late 1956 and 1957, after losing to rival gang members.\nIp's regular classes generally consisted of form practice, \"chi sao\" (sticking hands) drills, wooden dummy techniques, and free sparring. There was no set pattern for the classes. Other Chinese martial arts styles Lee trained in were Northern Praying Mantis, Southern Praying Mantis, Eagle Claw, Tan Tui, Law Hon, Mizongyi, Wa K'ung, Monkey, Southern Dragon, Fujian White Crane, Choy Li Fut, Hung Gar, Choy Gar, Fut Gar, Mok Gar, Yau Kung Moon, Li Gar, and Lau Gar. Martial arts expert Donn F. Draeger regarded Lee as worthy of a Kyokushin 6th dan by the standards of the 1970s.\nLee was trained in boxing, between 1956 and 1958, by Brother Edward, coach of the St. Francis Xavier's College boxing team. Lee went on to win the Hong Kong Schools boxing tournament in 1958 while scoring knockdowns against the previous champion Gary Elms in the final. After moving to the United States, Lee was heavily influenced by heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali, whose footwork he studied and incorporated into his style in the 1960s.\nLee demonstrated his Jeet Kune Do martial arts at the Long Beach International Karate Championships in 1964 and 1968, with the latter having higher-quality video footage available. Lee is seen demonstrating quick eye strikes before his opponent can block and demonstrating the one-inch punch on several volunteers. He demonstrates \"chi sao\" drills while blindfolded against an opponent, probing for weaknesses in his opponent while scoring with punches and takedowns. Lee then participates in a full-contact sparring bout against an opponent, with both wearing leather headgear.\nLee is seen implementing his Jeet Kune Do concept of economical motion, using Ali-inspired footwork to keep out of range while counter-attacking with backfists and straight punches. He halts attacks with stop-hit side kicks and quickly executes several sweeps and head kicks. The opponent repeatedly attempts to attack Lee but is never able to connect with a clean hit. He once managed to come close with a spin kick, but Lee counters it. The footage was reviewed by \"Black Belt\" magazine in 1995, concluding that \"the action is as fast and furious as anything in Lee's films.\"\nIt was at the 1964 championships that Lee first met taekwondo master Jhoongoo Rhee. While Rhee taught Lee the side kick in detail, Lee taught Rhee the \"non-telegraphic\" punch. Rhee learned what he calls the \"accupunch\" from Lee and incorporated it into American taekwondo. The \"accupunch\" is a rapid fast punch that is very difficult to block, based on human reaction time\u2014\"the idea is to finish the execution of the punch before the opponent can complete the brain-to-wrist communication.\"\nLee commonly used the oblique kick, made popular much later in mixed martial arts. It is called the \"jeet tek\", \"stop kick\" or \"intercepting kick\", in Jeet Kune Do.\nGrappling.\nLee favored cross-training between different fighting styles, and had a particular interest in grappling. Lee trained with several judo practitioners in Seattle and California, among them Fred Sato, Jesse Glover, Taky Kimura, Hayward Nishioka, and Wally Jay, as well as Gene LeBell. Many of his first students were proficient in judo and other arts, and he learned as much as he taught. After befriending LeBell on the set of \"The Green Hornet\", Lee offered to teach him striking arts in exchange for being taught grappling techniques. LeBell had been taught catch wrestling by prestigious grapplers Lou Thesz and Ed Lewis, and notable techniques of both judo and catch wrestling can be seen in Lee's \"Tao of Jeet Kune Do\". He also learned grappling moves from hapkido master Ji Han-jae.\nAccording to Glover, Lee only found judo ineffective at the action of getting hold of the opponent. In their first training together, Glover showed Lee an osoto gari, which Lee considered not a bad technique, but he disliked that Glover had needed to hold onto Lee. While in Seattle, Lee developed anti-grappling techniques against opponents trying to tackle him or take him to the ground. Glover recalled Lee \"definitely would not go to the ground if he had the opportunity to get you standing up\". Nonetheless, Lee expressed to LeBell a wish to integrate judo into his fighting style. He incorporated the osoto gari into Jeet Kune Do, among other throws, armlocks and chokeholds from judo.\nAlthough Lee opined that grappling was of little use in action choreography because it was not visually distinctive, he showcased grappling moves in his films, such as \"Way of the Dragon\", where his character finishes his opponent Chuck Norris with a neck hold inspired by LeBell, and \"Enter the Dragon\", whose prolog features Lee submitting his opponent Sammo Hung with an armbar. \"Game of Death\" also features Lee and Han-jae exchanging grappling moves, as well as Lee using wrestling against the character played by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\nLee was also influenced by the training routine of The Great Gama, an Indian/Pakistani pehlwani wrestling champion known for his grappling strength. Lee incorporated Gama's exercises into his training routine.\nStreet fighting.\nAnother major influence on Lee was Hong Kong's street fighting culture in the form of rooftop fights. In the mid-20th century, soaring crime in Hong Kong, combined with limited Hong Kong Police manpower, led to many young Hongkongers learning martial arts for self-defense. Around the 1960s, there were about 400 martial arts schools in Hong Kong, teaching their distinctive styles of martial arts. In Hong Kong's street fighting culture, there emerged a rooftop fight scene in the 1950s and 1960s, where gangs from rival martial arts schools challenged each other to bare-knuckle fights on Hong Kong's rooftops, to avoid crackdowns by British colonial authorities. Lee frequently participated in these Hong Kong rooftop fights. He combined different techniques from different martial arts schools into his own hybrid martial arts style.\nWhen Lee returned to Hong Kong in the early 1970s, his reputation as \"the fastest fist in the east\" routinely led to locals challenging him to street fights. He sometimes accepted these challenges and engaged in street fights, which led to some criticism from the press portraying him as violent at the time.\nFitness.\nAt and weighing , Lee was renowned for his physical fitness and vigor, achieved by using a dedicated fitness regimen to become as strong as possible. After his match with Wong Jack-man in 1965, Lee changed his approach toward martial arts training. Lee felt that many martial artists of his time did not spend enough time on physical conditioning. Lee included all elements of total fitness\u2014muscular strength, muscular endurance, cardiovascular endurance, and flexibility. He used traditional bodybuilding techniques to build some muscle mass, though not overdone, as that could decrease speed or flexibility. At the same time, concerning balance, Lee maintained that mental and spiritual preparation are fundamental to the success of physical training in martial arts skills. In \"Tao of Jeet Kune Do\" he wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Training is one of the most neglected phases of athletics. Too much time is given to the development of skill and too little to the development of the individual for participation.\u00a0... JKD, ultimately is not a matter of petty techniques but of highly developed spirituality and physique.\nAccording to Linda Lee Cadwell, soon after he moved to the United States, Lee started to take nutrition seriously and developed an interest in health foods, high-protein drinks, and vitamin and mineral supplements. He later concluded that achieving a high-performance body was akin to maintaining the engine of a high-performance automobile. Allegorically, as one could not keep a car running on low-octane fuels, one could not sustain one's body with a steady diet of junk food, and with \"the wrong fuel\", one's body would perform sluggishly or sloppily.\nLee avoided baked goods and refined flour, describing them as providing empty calories that did nothing for his body. He was known for being a fan of Asian cuisine for its variety and often ate meals with a combination of vegetables, rice, and fish. Lee had a dislike for dairy products and as a result, used powdered milk in his diet.\nDan Inosanto recalls Lee practiced meditation as the first action on his schedule.\nArtistry.\nPhilosophy.\nWhile best known as a martial artist, Lee studied drama and Asian and Western philosophy, starting while a student at the University of Washington. He was well-read and had an extensive library dominated by martial arts subjects and philosophical texts. His books on martial arts and fighting philosophy are known for their philosophical assertions, both inside and outside of martial arts circles. His eclectic philosophy often mirrored his fighting beliefs, though he was quick to say that his martial arts were solely a metaphor for such teachings.\nHe believed that any knowledge ultimately led to self-knowledge. He said that his chosen method of self-expression was martial arts. His influences include Taoism and Buddhism. Lee's philosophy was very much in opposition to the conservative worldview advocated by Confucianism. John Little states that Lee was an atheist. When asked in 1972 about his religious affiliation, he replied, \"None whatsoever\". When asked if he believed in God, he said, \"To be perfectly frank, I really do not.\"\nIn his notebooks, Lee cited and commented on passages from Plato, David Hume, Ren\u00e9 Descartes, and Thomas Aquinas, from Western philosophy, and Lao-tzu, Chuang-tzu, Miyamoto Musashi, and Alan Watts from Eastern thought. He was particularly interested in the Indian mystic Jiddu Krishnamurti.\nPoetry.\nAside from martial arts and philosophy, which focus on the physical aspect and self-consciousness for truths and principles, Lee also wrote poetry that reflected his emotions and a stage in his life collectively. Many forms of art remain concordant with the artist creating them. Lee's principle of self-expression was applied to his poetry as well. His daughter Shannon Lee said, \"He did write poetry; he was really the consummate artist.\"\nHis poetic works were originally handwritten on paper, then later on edited and published, with John Little being the major author (editor), for Bruce Lee's works. Linda Lee Cadwell (Bruce Lee's wife) shared her husband's notes, poems, and experiences with followers. She mentioned, \"Lee's poems are, by American standards, rather dark\u2014reflecting the deeper, less exposed recesses of the human psyche\".\nMost of Bruce Lee's poems are categorized as anti-poetry or fall into a paradox. The mood in his poems shows the side of the man that can be compared with other poets such as Robert Frost, one of many well-known poets expressing himself with dark poetic works. The paradox taken from the Yin and Yang symbol in martial arts was also integrated into his poetry. His martial arts and philosophy contribute a great part to his poetry. The free verse form of Lee's poetry reflects his quote \"Be formless\u00a0... shapeless, like water.\"\nPersonal life.\nNames.\nLee's Cantonese birth name was \"Lee Jun-fan\" (). The name homophonically means \"return again\", and was given to Lee by his mother, who felt he would return to the United States once he came of age. Because of his mother's superstitious nature, she had originally named him \"Sai-fon\" (), which is a feminine name meaning \"small phoenix\". The English name \"Bruce\" is thought to have been given by the hospital's attending physician, Dr. Mary Glover.\nLee had three other Chinese names: Lee Yuen-cham (), a family/clan name; Lee Yuen-kam (), which he used as a student name while he was attending La Salle College, and his Chinese screen name Lee Siu-lung (; \"Siu-lung\" means \"little dragon\"). Lee's given name Jun-fan was originally written in Chinese as ; however, the \"Jun\" () Chinese character was identical to part of his grandfather's name, Lee Jun-biu (). Hence, the Chinese character for \"Jun\" in Lee's name was changed to the homonym instead, to avoid naming taboo in Chinese tradition.\nFamily.\nLee's father, Lee Hoi-chuen, was one of the leading Cantonese opera and film actors at the time and was embarking on a year-long opera tour with his family on the eve of the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong. Lee Hoi-chuen had been touring the United States for many years and performing in numerous Chinese communities there.\nAlthough many of his peers decided to stay in the US, Lee Hoi-chuen returned to Hong Kong after Bruce's birth. Within months, Hong Kong was invaded and the Lees lived for three years and eight months under Japanese occupation. After the war ended, Lee Hoi-chuen resumed his acting career and became a more popular actor during Hong Kong's rebuilding years.\nLee's mother, Grace Ho, was from one of the wealthiest and most powerful clans in Hong Kong, the Ho-tungs. She was the half-niece of Sir Robert Ho-tung, the Eurasian patriarch of the clan. As such, the young Bruce Lee grew up in an affluent and privileged environment. Despite the advantage of his family's status, the neighborhood in which Lee grew up became overcrowded, dangerous, and full of gang rivalries due to an influx of refugees fleeing communist China for Hong Kong, at that time a British Crown Colony.\nGrace Ho is reported as either the adopted or biological daughter of Ho Kom-tong (Ho Gumtong, ) and the half-niece of Sir Robert Ho-tung, both notable Hong Kong businessmen and philanthropists. Bruce was the fourth of five children: Phoebe Lee (), Agnes Lee (), Peter Lee, and Robert Lee.\nGrace's parentage remains unclear. Linda Lee, in her 1989 biography \"The Bruce Lee Story\", suggests that Grace had a German father and was a Catholic. Bruce Thomas, in his 1994 biography \"Bruce Lee: Fighting Spirit\", suggests that Grace had a Chinese mother and a German father. Lee's relative Eric Peter Ho, in his 2010 book \"Tracing My Children's Lineage\", suggests that Grace was born in Shanghai to a Eurasian woman named Cheung King-sin. Eric Peter Ho said that Grace Lee was the daughter of a mixed-race Shanghainese woman and her father was Ho Kom Tong. Grace Lee herself reported that her mother was English and her father was Chinese. Fredda Dudley Balling said Grace Lee was three-quarters Chinese and one-quarter British.\nIn the 2018 biography \"Bruce Lee: A Life\", Matthew Polly identifies Lee's maternal grandfather as Ho Kom-tong, who had often been reported as his adoptive grandfather. Ho Kom-tong's father, Charles Maurice Bosman, was a Dutch Jewish businessman from Rotterdam. He moved to Hong Kong with the Dutch East India Company and served as the Dutch consul to Hong Kong at one time. He had a Chinese concubine named Sze Tai with whom he had six children, including Ho Kom Tong. Bosman subsequently abandoned his family and immigrated to California. Ho Kom Tong became a wealthy businessman with a wife, 13\u00a0concubines, and a British mistress who gave birth to Grace Ho.\nHis younger brother Robert Lee Jun-fai is a musician and singer; he performed in the Hong Kong group The Thunderbirds. A few singles were sung mostly or all in English. Also released was Lee singing a duet with Irene Ryder. Lee Jun-fai lived with Lee in Los Angeles in the United States and stayed. After Lee's death, Lee Jun-fai released an album and a single by the same name dedicated to Lee called \"The Ballad of Bruce Lee\".\nWhile studying at the University of Washington he met his future wife Linda Emery, a fellow student studying to become a teacher. As relations between people of different races were still banned in many US states, they married in secret in August 1964. Lee had two children with Linda: Brandon (1965\u20131993) and Shannon Lee (born 1969). Upon's Lee passing in 1973, she continued to promote Bruce Lee's martial art Jeet Kune Do. She wrote the 1975 book ', on which the 1993 feature film ' was based. In 1989, she wrote the book \"The Bruce Lee Story.\" She retired in 2001 from the family estate.\nLee died when his son Brandon was eight years old. While alive, Lee taught Brandon martial arts and would invite him to visit sets. This gave Brandon the desire to act and he went on to study the craft. As a young adult, Brandon Lee found some success acting in action-oriented pictures such as \"Legacy of Rage\" (1986), \"Showdown in Little Tokyo\" (1991), and \"Rapid Fire\" (1992). In 1993, at the age of 28, Brandon Lee died after being accidentally shot by a prop gun on the set of \"The Crow\".\nLee died when his daughter Shannon was four. In her youth she studied Jeet Kune Do under Richard Bustillo, one of her father's students; however, her serious studies did not begin until the late 1990s. To train for parts in action movies, she studied Jeet Kune Do with Ted Wong.\nFriends, students, and contemporaries.\nLee's brother Robert with his friends Taky Kimura, Dan Inosanto, Steve McQueen, James Coburn, and Peter Chin were his pallbearers. Coburn was a martial arts student and a friend of Lee. Coburn worked with Lee and Stirling Silliphant on developing \"The Silent Flute.\" Upon Lee's early death, at his funeral, Coburn gave a eulogy. Regarding McQueen, Lee made no secret that he wanted everything McQueen had and would stop at nothing to get it. Inosanto and Kimura were friends and disciples of Lee. Inosanto would go on to train Lee's son Brandon. Kimura continued to teach Lee's craft in Seattle. According to Lee's wife, Chin was a lifelong family friend and a student of Lee.\nJames Yimm Lee (no relation) was one of Lee's three personally certified 3rd rank instructors and co-founded the Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute in Oakland where he taught Jun Fan Gung Fu in Lee's absence. James was responsible for introducing Lee to Ed Parker, the organizer of the Long Beach International Karate Championships, where Lee was first introduced to the martial arts community. Hollywood couple Roman Pola\u0144ski and Sharon Tate studied martial arts with Lee. Pola\u0144ski flew Lee to Switzerland to train him. Tate studied with Lee in preparation for her role in \"The Wrecking Crew\". After Tate was murdered by the Manson Family, Pola\u0144ski initially suspected Lee.\nScreenwriter Stirling Silliphant was a martial arts student and a friend of Lee. Silliphant worked with Lee and James Coburn on developing \"The Silent Flute.\" Lee acted and provided his martial arts expertise in several projects penned by Silliphant, the first in \"Marlowe\" (1969) where Lee plays Winslow Wong a hoodlum well-versed in martial arts. Lee also did fight choreographies for the film \"A Walk in the Spring Rain\" (1970) and played Li Tsung, a Jeet Kune Do instructor who teaches the main character in the television show \"Longstreet\" (1971). Elements of his martial arts philosophy were included in the script for the latter.\nBasketball player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar studied martial arts and developed a friendship with Lee. Actor and karate champion Chuck Norris was a friend and training partner of Lee's. After Lee's death, Norris said he kept in touch with Lee's family. Judoka and professional wrestler Gene LeBell became a friend of Lee on the set of \"The Green Hornet\". They trained together and exchanged their knowledge of martial arts.\nTaiwanese actress Betty Ting immediately came under media's spotlight after it was revealed that Bruce Lee was found unconscious at her flat before his death. At her testimony Ting said she was asked by producer Raymond Chow, who in turn was told by Lee's family, not to disclose that Lee was at her apartment, which contributed to the misinformation that Lee died at his own house. Ting later said Lee fell in love with her and the two shared a close relation. Her constant presence by Lee's side earned the affectionate nickname of \"Little Dragon Girl\" (or Bruce's Girl).\nDrug use.\nIn July 2021 a private collection of over 40 handwritten letters Lee made to fellow \"Fist of Fury\" actor Robert \"Bob\" Baker was sold for $462,500 at Heritage Auctions. These letters were written from 1967 to 1973 and included requests by Lee for Baker to mail him cocaine, pain killers, psilocybin and other drugs for his personal use. Doctor Poon Wai-ming in Hong Kong said cocaine could have caused his collapse in May 1973, two months before his death.\nDeath.\nOn May 10, 1973, Lee collapsed during an automated dialogue replacement session for \"Enter the Dragon\" at Orange Sky Golden Harvest Film Studio in Hong Kong. Because he was having epileptic seizures and headaches, he was rushed to Hong Kong Baptist Hospital, where doctors diagnosed cerebral edema. He had a high fever and was completely unconscious without any signs of breathing. They were able to reduce the swelling through the administration of mannitol. A brain scan in the United States after this diagnosed Bruce Lee with convulsive disorder.\nOn July 20, 1973, Lee was in Hong Kong planning to have dinner with actor George Lazenby, with whom he intended to make a film. According to Lee's wife Linda and testimony at Lee's coroner's court, Lee met producer Raymond Chow at 2\u00a0p.m. at home to discuss the making of the film \"Game of Death\". They worked until 4\u00a0p.m. and then drove together to the home of Lee's colleague Betty Ting arriving at around 5. The three then went over the script at Ting's home. At around 7 Lee, having a headache, took a pill of painkiller from Ting and took a nap. Chow left around an hour later to attend a dinner meeting with Lazenby, which Lee was expected to join later.\nWhen Lee did not arrive at the dinner, Chow came to the apartment at around 9.45 p.m., but he was unable to wake Lee up. Chu Poh-hwye, a private doctor of Ting, was summoned at 10, as Lee's doctor was unreachable, and spent ten minutes attempting to revive Lee, who by then no longer had any vital signs, before sending him by ambulance to Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Lee was declared dead on arrival at the age of 32.\nLee was buried in Lake View Cemetery in Seattle. Pallbearers at Lee's funeral on July 25, 1973, included Taky Kimura, Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Dan Inosanto, Peter Chin, and Lee's brother Robert.\nPossible causes of death.\nDonald Teare, a senior British pathologist recommended by Scotland Yard who had overseen over 1,000 autopsies, was assigned to perform an autopsy on Lee. His conclusion was \"death by misadventure\" caused by cerebral edema due to a reaction to compounds present in the combination medication Equagesic. According to autopsy reports, Lee's brain had swollen from 1,400 to 1,575 grams, a 12.5% increase. Lee had taken Equagesic on the day of his death, which contained both aspirin and the sedative meprobamate, although he had taken it many times before. The Coroner's Court unanimously returned a \"death by misadventure\" verdict.\nLee's iconic status and untimely death fed many rumors and theories. These included murder involving the triads and a supposed curse on him and his family. Tabloids and magazines in Hong Kong publicised multiple conspiracy theories on Lee's death for viewership.\nAlthough there was initial speculation that cannabis found in Lee's stomach may have contributed to his death, Teare said it would \"be both 'irresponsible and irrational' to say that [cannabis] might have triggered either the events of Bruce's collapse on May 10 or his death on July 20\". Dr. R. R. Lycette, the clinical pathologist at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, reported at the coroner hearing that the death could not have been caused by cannabis. Armed Forces Institute of Pathology of the United States concluded that they were unable to attribute Lee's death to cannabis intoxication.\nIn a 2018 biography, author Matthew Polly consulted with medical experts and theorized that the cerebral edema that killed Lee had been caused by over-exertion and heat stroke; heat stroke was not considered at the time because it was then a poorly understood condition. Furthermore, Lee had his underarm sweat glands removed in late 1972, in the apparent belief that underarm sweat was unphotogenic on film. Polly further theorized that this caused Lee's body to overheat while practicing in hot temperatures on May 10 and July 20, 1973, resulting in heat stroke that in turn exacerbated the cerebral edema that led to his death.\nIn an article in the December 2022 issue of \"Clinical Kidney Journal\", a team of researchers examined the various theories regarding Lee's cause of death, and concluded that his fatal cerebral edema was brought on by hyponatremia, an insufficient concentration of sodium in the blood. The authors noted that several risk factors predisposed Lee to hyponatremia, including excessive water intake, insufficient solute intake, alcohol consumption, and use or overuse of multiple drugs which impair the ability of the kidneys to excrete excess fluids. Lee's symptoms before his death were also found to closely match known cases of fatal hyponatremia.\nIn July 2025, the Hong Kong TVB program \"Ctrl+F The Truth\" concluded that Lee died of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, based on opinions from medical experts, after other causes of death including cerebral edema caused by aspirin allergy, which was suspected by the court, were considered unlikely. It was presumed that a lack of professional knowledge or attempts to protect Lee's legacy hid the true cause of his death at the time.\nLegacy and cultural impact.\nLee is considered by some commentators and martial artists to be the most influential martial artist of all time, and a pop culture icon of the 20th century, who bridged the gap between East and West. \"Time\" named Lee one of the .\nA number of biography books have been written about Lee. A biography had sold more than 4 million copies by 1988.\nAction films.\nLee was largely responsible for launching the \"kung fu craze\" of the 1970s. He initially introduced kung fu to the West with American television shows such as \"The Green Hornet\" and \"Kung Fu\", before the \"kung fu craze\" began with the dominance of Hong Kong martial arts films in 1973. Lee's success inspired a wave of Western martial arts films and television shows throughout the 1970s\u20131990s (launching the careers of Western martial arts stars such as Jean-Claude Van Damme, Steven Seagal and Chuck Norris), as well as the more general integration of Asian martial arts into Western action films and television shows during the 1980s\u20131990s.\n\"Enter the Dragon\" has been cited as one of the most influential action films of all time. Sascha Matuszak of \"Vice\" said \"Enter the Dragon\" \"is referenced in all manner of media, the plot line and characters continue to influence storytellers today, and the impact was particularly felt in the revolutionizing way the film portrayed African-Americans, Asians and traditional martial arts.\" Kuan-Hsing Chen and Beng Huat Chua cited fight scenes in Lee's films such as \"Enter the Dragon\" as being influential for the way they pitched \"an elemental story of good against evil in such a spectacle-saturated way\".\nA number of action filmmakers around the world have cited Bruce Lee as a formative influence on their careers, including Hong Kong action film directors such as Jackie Chan and John Woo, and Hollywood filmmakers such as Quentin Tarantino and Brett Ratner.\nMartial arts and combat sports.\nJeet Kune Do, a hybrid martial arts philosophy drawing from different combat disciplines that was founded by Lee, is sometimes credited with paving the way for the combat sport mixed martial arts (MMA). The concept of mixed martial arts was popularized in the West by Bruce Lee via his system of Jeet Kune Do. Lee believed that \"the best fighter is not a Boxer, Karate or Judo man. The best fighter is someone who can adapt to any style, to be formless, to adopt an individual's own style and not following the system of styles.\"\nIn 2004, Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) founder Dana White called Lee the \"father of mixed martial arts\" and stated: \"If you look at the way Bruce Lee trained, the way he fought, and many of the things he wrote, he said the perfect style was no style. You take a little something from everything. You take the good things from every different discipline, use what works, and you throw the rest away\".\nLee was largely responsible for many people's decisions to take up martial arts. These include numerous fighters in combat sports who were inspired by Lee; boxing champion Sugar Ray Leonard said he perfected his jab by watching Lee, boxing champion Manny Pacquiao compared his fighting style to Lee, and UFC champion Conor McGregor has compared himself to Lee and said that he believes Lee would have been a champion in the UFC if he were to compete in the present day.\nLee inspired the foundation of American full-contact kickboxing tournaments by Joe Lewis and Benny Urquidez in the 1970s. American taekwondo pioneer Jhoon Goo Rhee learned from Lee what he calls the \"accupunch\", which he incorporated into American taekwondo. Rhee later coached heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali and taught him the \"accupunch\", which Ali used to knockout Richard Dunn in 1975. According to heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson, \"everyone wanted to be Bruce Lee\" in the 1970s.\nFormer UFC Heavyweight Champion and Light Heavyweight Champion Jon Jones cited Lee as inspiration, with Jones known for frequently using the oblique kick to the knee, a technique that was popularized by Lee. Former UFC Middleweight Champion Anderson Silva has also cited Lee as an inspiration. Numerous other UFC fighters have cited Lee as their inspiration, with several referring to him as a \"godfather\" or \"grandfather\" of MMA.\nRacial barriers and stereotypes.\nLee is credited with helping to change the way Asians were presented in American films. He defied Asian stereotypes, such as the emasculated Asian male stereotype. His friend Amy Sanbo recalls that, \"In a time when so many Asians were trying to convince themselves they were white, Bruce was so proud to be Chinese he was busting with it.\" In contrast to earlier stereotypes which depicted Asian men as emasculated, childlike, coolies, or domestic servants, Lee demonstrated that Asian men could be \"tough, strong and sexy\" according to University of Michigan lecturer Hye Seung Chung. In turn, Lee's popularity inspired a new Asian stereotype, the martial artist.\nIn North America, his films initially played largely to black, Asian and Hispanic audiences. Within black communities, Lee's popularity was second only to heavyweight boxer Muhammad Ali in the 1970s. As Lee broke through to the mainstream, he became a rare non-white movie star in a Hollywood industry dominated by white actors at the time. According to rapper LL Cool J, Lee's films were the first time many non-white American children such as himself had seen a non-white action hero on the big screen in the 1970s.\nPopular culture.\nNumerous entertainment and sports figures around the world have cited Lee as a major influence on their work, including martial arts actors such as Jackie Chan and Donnie Yen, actor-bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger, actor-comedians such as Eddie Murphy and Eddie Griffin, actresses such as Olivia Munn and Dianne Doan, musicians such as Steve Aoki and Rohan Marley, rappers such as LL Cool J and Wu-Tang Clan leader RZA, bands such as Gorillaz, comedians such as W. Kamau Bell and Margaret Cho, basketball players Stephen Curry and Jamal Murray, skaters Tony Hawk and Christian Hosoi, and American footballer Kyler Murray, among others.\nBruce Lee influenced several comic book writers, notably Marvel Comics founder Stan Lee, who considered Bruce Lee to be a superhero without a costume. Shortly after his death, Lee inspired the Marvel characters Shang-Chi (debuted 1973) and Iron Fist (debuted 1974) as well as the comic book series \"The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu\" (debuted 1974). According to Stan Lee, any character that has been a martial artist since then owes their origin to Bruce Lee in some form.\nBruce Lee was a formative influence on the development of breakdancing in the 1970s. Early breakdancing pioneers such as the Rock Steady Crew drew inspiration from kung fu moves, as performed by Lee, inspiring dance moves such as the windmill among other breaking moves.\nIn India, Lee films had an influence on Hindi masala films. After the success of Lee films such as \"Enter the Dragon\" in India, \"Deewaar\" (1975) and later Hindi films incorporated fight scenes inspired by 1970s Hong Kong martial arts films up until the 1990s. According to Indian film star Aamir Khan, when he was a child, \"almost every house had a poster of Bruce Lee\" in 1970s Bombay.\nIn Japan, the manga and anime franchises \"Fist of the North Star\" (1983\u20131988) and \"Dragon Ball\" (1984\u20131995) were inspired by Lee films such as \"Enter the Dragon\". In turn, \"Fist of the North Star\" and especially \"Dragon Ball\" are credited with setting the trends for popular sh\u014dnen manga and anime from the 1980s onwards. Spike Spiegel, the protagonist from the 1998 anime \"Cowboy Bebop\", is seen practicing Jeet Kune Do and quotes Lee.\nBruce Lee films such as \"Game of Death\" and \"Enter the Dragon\" were the foundation for video game genres such as beat 'em up action games and fighting games. The first beat 'em up game, \"Kung-Fu Master\" (1984), was based on Lee's \"Game of Death\". The \"Street Fighter\" video game franchise (1987 debut) was inspired by \"Enter the Dragon\", with the gameplay centered around an international fighting tournament, and each character having a unique combination of ethnicity, nationality and fighting style; \"Street Fighter\" went on to set the template for all fighting games that followed. Since then, nearly every major fighting game franchise has had a character based on Bruce Lee. In April 2014, Lee was named a featured character in the combat sports video game \"EA Sports UFC\", and is playable in multiple weight classes.\nIn France, the Yamakasi cited the martial arts philosophy of Bruce Lee as an influence on their development of the parkour discipline in the 1990s, along with the acrobatics of Jackie Chan. The Yamakasi considered Lee to be the \"unofficial president\" of their group.\n\"The Legend of Bruce Lee\" (2008), a Chinese television drama series based on the life of Bruce Lee, has been watched by over 400 million viewers in China, making it the most-watched Chinese television drama series of all time, as of 2017.\nIn November 2022, it was announced that Taiwanese filmmaker Ang Lee was directing a biopic on Bruce Lee. Ang Lee's son Mason Lee was cast to star in the movie, while Bruce Lee's daughter, Shannon Lee, is set to produce the film.\nIn 2024, there was a proposal made to erect a statue of Bruce Lee in San Francisco. Lee's daughter is in favor of erecting it stating, \"the Bay Area is a very rich and vital part of our legacy.\"\nBruce Lee appears in \"\" in September 2025. Lee is reinvented as an agent in the game, assassinating opponents during a martial arts competition. The player's goal is to prevent enemies from getting in the way.\nTributes.\nUnderworld pay tribute to Bruce Lee in their song Bruce Lee from their 1999 album Beaucoup Fish, a blend of rock, techno, and guitar riffs. According to DAFT FM, the lyrics can be interpreted as encouraging the idea of self-actualization and individuals to be true to themselves, thus paying tribute to Lee's philosophy of empowering oneself and living life to the fullest.\nCommercials.\nThough Bruce Lee did not appear in commercials during his lifetime, his likeness and image has since appeared in hundreds of commercials around the world. Nokia launched an Internet-based campaign in 2008 with staged \"documentary-looking\" footage of Bruce Lee playing ping-pong with his nunchaku and also igniting matches as they are thrown toward him. The videos went viral on YouTube, creating confusion as some people believed them to be authentic footage.\nHonors.\nPlaces.\nA theme park dedicated to Lee was built in Jun'an, Guangdong. Mainland Chinese only started watching Bruce Lee films in the 1980s, when videos of classic movies like \"Fist of Fury\" became available.\nOn January 6, 2009, it was announced that Lee's Hong Kong home (41 Cumberland Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong) would be preserved and transformed into a tourist site by Yu Pang-lin. Yu died in 2015 and this plan did not materialize. In 2018, Yu's grandson, Pang Chi-ping, said: \"We will convert the mansion into a centre for Chinese studies next year, which provides courses like Mandarin and Chinese music for children.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37314", "revid": "50986162", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37314", "title": "Cypherpunk", "text": "Activist advocating widespread use of strong cryptography\nA cypherpunk is one who advocates the widespread use of strong cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies as a means of effecting social and political change. The cypherpunk movement originated in the late 1980s and gained traction with the establishment of the \"Cypherpunks\" electronic mailing list in 1992, where informal groups of activists, technologists, and cryptographers discussed strategies to enhance individual privacy and resist state or corporate surveillance. Deeply libertarian in philosophy, the movement is rooted in principles of decentralization, individual autonomy, and freedom from centralized authority. Its influence on society extends to the development of technologies that have reshaped global finance, communication, and privacy practices, such as the creation of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which embody cypherpunk ideals of decentralized money. \nThe movement has also contributed to the mainstreaming of encryption in everyday technologies, such as secure messaging apps and privacy-focused web browsers. \nHistory.\nBefore the mailing list.\nUntil about the 1970s, cryptography was mainly practiced in secret by military or spy agencies. However, that changed when two publications brought it into public awareness: the first publicly available work on public-key cryptography, by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, and the US government publication of the Data Encryption Standard (DES), a block cipher which became very widely used.\nThe technical roots of Cypherpunk ideas have been traced back to work by cryptographer David Chaum on topics such as anonymous digital cash and pseudonymous reputation systems, described in his paper \"Security without Identification: Transaction Systems to Make Big Brother Obsolete\" (1985).\nIn the late 1980s, these ideas coalesced into something like a movement.\nEtymology and the Cypherpunks mailing list.\nIn late 1992, Eric Hughes, Timothy C. May, and John Gilmore founded a small group that met monthly at Gilmore's company Cygnus Solutions in the San Francisco Bay Area and was humorously termed \"cypherpunks\" by Jude Milhon at one of the first meetings\u2014derived from \"cipher\" and \"cyberpunk\". In November 2006, the word was added to the Oxford English Dictionary.\nThe Cypherpunks mailing list was started in 1992, and by 1994 had 700 subscribers. At its peak, it was a very active forum with technical discussions ranging over mathematics, cryptography, computer science, political and philosophical discussion, personal arguments and attacks, etc., with some spam thrown in. An email from John Gilmore reports an average of 30 messages a day from December 1, 1996, to March 1, 1999, and suggests that the number was probably higher earlier. The number of subscribers is estimated to have reached 2,000 in the year 1997.\nIn early 1997, Jim Choate and Igor Chudov set up the Cypherpunks Distributed Remailer, a network of independent mailing list nodes intended to eliminate the single point of failure inherent in a centralized list architecture. At its peak, the Cypherpunks Distributed Remailer included at least seven nodes. By mid-2005, al-qaeda.net ran the only remaining node. In mid-2013, following a brief outage, the al-qaeda.net node's list software was changed from Majordomo to GNU Mailman, and subsequently the node was renamed to cpunks.org. The CDR architecture is now defunct, though the list administrator stated in 2013 that he was exploring a way to integrate this functionality with the new mailing list software.\nFor a time, the cypherpunks mailing list was a popular tool with mailbombers, who would subscribe a victim to the mailing list in order to cause a deluge of messages to be sent to him or her. (This was usually done as a prank, in contrast to the style of terrorist referred to as a mailbomber.) This precipitated the mailing list sysop(s) to institute a reply-to-subscribe system. Approximately two hundred messages a day was typical for the mailing list, divided between personal arguments and attacks, political discussion, technical discussion, and early spam.\nThe cypherpunks mailing list had extensive discussions of the public policy issues related to cryptography and on the politics and philosophy of concepts such as anonymity, pseudonyms, reputation, and privacy. These discussions continue both on the remaining node and elsewhere as the list has become increasingly moribund.\nEvents such as the GURPS Cyberpunk raid lent weight to the idea that private individuals needed to take steps to protect their privacy. In its heyday, the list discussed public policy issues related to cryptography, as well as more practical nuts-and-bolts mathematical, computational, technological, and cryptographic matters. The list had a range of viewpoints and there was probably no completely unanimous agreement on anything. The general attitude, though, definitely put personal privacy and personal liberty above all other considerations.\nEarly discussion of online privacy.\nThe list was discussing questions about privacy, government monitoring, corporate control of information, and related issues in the early 1990s that did not become major topics for broader discussion until at least ten years later. Some list participants were highly radical on these issues.\nThose wishing to understand the context of the list might refer to the history of cryptography; in the early 1990s, the US government considered cryptography software a munition for export purposes (PGP source code was published as a paper book to bypass these regulations and demonstrate their futility). In 1992, a deal between NSA and SPA allowed export of cryptography based on 40-bit RC2 and RC4 which was considered relatively weak (and especially after SSL was created, there were many contests to break it). The US government had also tried to subvert cryptography through schemes such as Skipjack and key escrow. It was also not widely known that all communications were logged by government agencies (which would later be revealed during the NSA and AT&amp;T scandals) though this was taken as an obvious axiom by list members.\nThe original cypherpunk mailing list, and the first list spin-off, \"coderpunks\", were originally hosted on John Gilmore's toad.com, but after a falling out with the sysop over moderation, the list was migrated to several cross-linked mail-servers in what was called the \"distributed mailing list.\" The \"coderpunks\" list, open by invitation only, existed for a time. \"Coderpunks\" took up more technical matters and had less discussion of public policy implications. There are several lists today that can trace their lineage directly to the original Cypherpunks list: the cryptography list (cryptography@metzdowd.com), the financial cryptography list (fc-announce@ifca.ai), and a small group of closed (invitation-only) lists as well.\nToad.com continued to run with the existing subscriber list, those that didn't unsubscribe, and was mirrored on the new distributed mailing list, but messages from the distributed list didn't appear on toad.com. As the list faded in popularity, so too did it fade in the number of cross-linked subscription nodes.\nTo some extent, the cryptography list acts as a successor to cypherpunks; it has many of the people and continues some of the same discussions. However, it is a moderated list, considerably less zany and somewhat more technical. A number of current systems in use trace to the mailing list, including Pretty Good Privacy, /dev/random in the Linux kernel (the actual code has been completely reimplemented several times since then) and today's anonymous remailers.\nMain principles.\nThe basic ideas can be found in \"https://\" (Eric Hughes, 1993): \"Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. ... We cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant us privacy ... We must defend our own privacy if we expect to have any. ... Cypherpunks write code. We know that someone has to write software to defend privacy, and ... we're going to write it.\"\nSome are or were senior people at major hi-tech companies and others are well-known researchers (see list with affiliations below).\nThe first mass media discussion of cypherpunks was in a 1993 \"Wired\" article by Steven Levy titled \"Crypto Rebels\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The people in this room hope for a world where an individual's informational footprints\u2014everything from an opinion on abortion to the medical record of an actual abortion\u2014can be traced only if the individual involved chooses to reveal them; a world where coherent messages shoot around the globe by network and microwave, but intruders and feds trying to pluck them out of the vapor find only gibberish; a world where the tools of prying are transformed into the instruments of privacy.\nThere is only one way this vision will materialize, and that is by widespread use of cryptography. Is this technologically possible? Definitely. The obstacles are political\u2014some of the most powerful forces in government are devoted to the control of these tools. In short, there is a war going on between those who would liberate crypto and those who would suppress it. The seemingly innocuous bunch strewn around this conference room represents the vanguard of the pro-crypto forces. Though the battleground seems remote, the stakes are not: The outcome of this struggle may determine the amount of freedom our society will grant us in the 21st century. To the Cypherpunks, freedom is an issue worth some risk.\nThe three masked men on the cover of that edition of \"Wired\" were prominent cypherpunks Tim May, Eric Hughes and John Gilmore.\nLater, Levy wrote a book, \"Crypto: How the Code Rebels Beat the Government\u00a0\u2013 Saving Privacy in the Digital Age\",\ncovering the crypto wars of the 1990s in detail. \"Code Rebels\" in the title is almost synonymous with cypherpunks.\nThe term \"cypherpunk\" is mildly ambiguous. In most contexts it means anyone advocating cryptography as a tool for social change, social impact and expression. However, it can also be used to mean a participant in the Cypherpunks electronic mailing list described below. The two meanings obviously overlap, but they are by no means synonymous.\nDocuments exemplifying cypherpunk ideas include Timothy C. May's \"The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto\" (1992) and \"The Cyphernomicon\" (1994), \"A Cypherpunk's Manifesto\".\nPrivacy of communications.\nA very basic cypherpunk issue is privacy in communications and data retention. John Gilmore said he wanted \"a guarantee -- with physics and mathematics, not with laws -- that we can give ourselves real privacy of personal communications.\"\nSuch guarantees require strong cryptography, so cypherpunks are fundamentally opposed to government policies attempting to control the usage or export of cryptography, which remained an issue throughout the late 1990s. The \"Cypherpunk Manifesto\" stated \"Cypherpunks deplore regulations on cryptography, for encryption is fundamentally a private act.\"\nThis was a central issue for many cypherpunks. Most were passionately opposed to various government attempts to limit cryptography\u2014export laws, promotion of limited key length ciphers, and especially escrowed encryption.\nAnonymity and pseudonyms.\nThe questions of anonymity, pseudonymity and reputation were also extensively discussed.\nArguably, the possibility of anonymous speech, and publication is vital for an open society and genuine freedom of speech\u2014this is the position of most cypherpunks.\nCensorship and monitoring.\nIn general, cypherpunks opposed the censorship and monitoring from government and police.\nIn particular, the US government's Clipper chip scheme for escrowed encryption of telephone conversations (encryption supposedly secure against most attackers, but breakable by government) was seen as anathema by many on the list. This was an issue that provoked strong opposition and brought many new recruits to the cypherpunk ranks. List participant Matt Blaze found a serious flaw in the scheme, helping to hasten its demise.\nSteven Schear first suggested the warrant canary in 2002 to thwart the secrecy provisions of court orders and national security letters. As of 2013[ [update]], warrant canaries are gaining commercial acceptance.\nHiding the act of hiding.\nAn important set of discussions concerns the use of cryptography in the presence of oppressive authorities. As a result, Cypherpunks have discussed and improved steganographic methods that hide the use of crypto itself, or that allow interrogators to believe that they have forcibly extracted hidden information from a subject. For instance, \"Rubberhose\" was a tool that partitioned and intermixed secret data on a drive with fake secret data, each of which accessed via a different password. Interrogators, having extracted a password, are led to believe that they have indeed unlocked the desired secrets, whereas in reality the actual data is still hidden. In other words, even its presence is hidden. Likewise, cypherpunks have also discussed under what conditions encryption may be used without being noticed by network monitoring systems installed by oppressive regimes.\nActivities.\nAs the \"Manifesto\" says, \"Cypherpunks write code\"; the notion that good ideas need to be implemented, not just discussed, is very much part of the culture of the mailing list. John Gilmore, whose site hosted the original cypherpunks mailing list, wrote: \"We are literally in a race between our ability to build and deploy technology, and their ability to build and deploy laws and treaties. Neither side is likely to back down or wise up until it has definitively lost the race.\"\nSoftware projects.\nAnonymous remailers such as the Mixmaster Remailer were almost entirely a cypherpunk development. Other cypherpunk-related projects include PGP for email privacy, FreeS/WAN for opportunistic encryption of the whole net, Off-the-record messaging for privacy in Internet chat, and the Tor project for anonymous web surfing.\nHardware.\nIn 1998, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, with assistance from the mailing list, built a $200,000 machine that could brute-force a Data Encryption Standard key in a few days. The project demonstrated that DES was, without question, insecure and obsolete, in sharp contrast to the US government's recommendation of the algorithm.\nExpert panels.\nCypherpunks also participated, along with other experts, in several reports on cryptographic matters.\nOne such paper was \"Minimal Key Lengths for Symmetric Ciphers to Provide Adequate Commercial Security\". It suggested 75 bits was the \"minimum\" key size to allow an existing cipher to be considered secure and kept in service. At the time, the Data Encryption Standard with 56-bit keys was still a US government standard, mandatory for some applications.\nOther papers were critical analysis of government schemes. \"The Risks of Key Recovery, Key Escrow, and Trusted Third-Party Encryption\", evaluated escrowed encryption proposals. \"Comments on the Carnivore System Technical Review\". looked at an FBI scheme for monitoring email.\nCypherpunks provided significant input to the 1996 National Research Council report on encryption policy,\n\"Cryptography's Role In Securing the Information Society\" (CRISIS). This report, commissioned by the U.S. Congress in 1993, was developed via extensive hearings across the nation from all interested stakeholders, by a committee of talented people. It recommended a gradual relaxation of the existing U.S. government restrictions on encryption. Like many such study reports, its conclusions were largely ignored by policy-makers. Later events such as the final rulings in the cypherpunks lawsuits forced a more complete relaxation of the unconstitutional controls on encryption software.\nLawsuits.\nCypherpunks have filed a number of lawsuits, mostly suits against the US government alleging that some government action is unconstitutional.\nPhil Karn sued the State Department in 1994 over cryptography export controls after they ruled that, while the book \"Applied Cryptography\" could legally be exported, a floppy disk containing a verbatim copy of code printed in the book was legally a munition and required an export permit, which they refused to grant. Karn also appeared before both House and Senate committees looking at cryptography issues.\nDaniel J. Bernstein, supported by the EFF, also sued over the export restrictions, arguing that preventing publication of cryptographic source code is an unconstitutional restriction on freedom of speech. He won, effectively overturning the export law. See \"Bernstein v. United States\" for details.\nPeter Junger also sued on similar grounds, and won.\nCivil disobedience.\nCypherpunks encouraged civil disobedience, in particular, US law on the export of cryptography. Until 1997, cryptographic code was legally a munition and fell under ITAR, and the key length restrictions in the EAR was not removed until 2000.\nIn 1995 Adam Back wrote a version of the RSA algorithm for public-key cryptography in three lines of Perl and suggested people use it as an email signature file:\n$/=unpack('H*',$_);$_=`echo 16dio\\U$k\"SK$/SM$n\\EsN0p[lN*1\nlK[d2%Sa2/d0$^Ixp\"|dc`;s/\\W//g;$_=pack('H*',/((..)*)$/)\nVince Cate put up a web page that invited anyone to become an international arms trafficker; every time someone clicked on the form, an export-restricted item\u2014originally PGP, later a copy of Back's program\u2014would be mailed from a US server to one in Anguilla.\nCypherpunk fiction.\nIn Neal Stephenson's novel \"Cryptonomicon\" many characters are on the \"Secret Admirers\" mailing list. This is fairly obviously based on the cypherpunks list, and several well-known cypherpunks are mentioned in the acknowledgements. Much of the plot revolves around cypherpunk ideas; the leading characters are building a data haven which will allow anonymous financial transactions, and the book is full of cryptography. But, according to the author the book's title is\u2014in spite of its similarity\u2014not based on the Cyphernomicon, an online cypherpunk FAQ document.\nLegacy.\nCypherpunk achievements would later also be used on the Canadian e-wallet, the MintChip, and the creation of bitcoin. It was an inspiration for CryptoParty decades later to such an extent that \"A Cypherpunk's Manifesto\" is quoted at the header of its Wiki, and Eric Hughes delivered the keynote address at the Amsterdam CryptoParty on 27 August 2012.\nNotable cypherpunks.\nCypherpunks list participants included many notable computer industry figures. Most were list regulars, although not all would call themselves \"cypherpunks\". The following is a list of noteworthy cypherpunks and their achievements:\n\"This article incorporates material from the Citizendium article \"\", which is licensed under the but not under the .\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This software is used to increase the productivity of the designer, improve the quality of design, improve communications through documentation, and to create a database for manufacturing. Designs made through CAD software help protect products and inventions when used in patent applications. CAD output is often in the form of electronic files for print, machining, or other manufacturing operations. The terms computer-aided drafting (CAD) and computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) are also used.\nIts use in designing electronic systems is known as \"electronic design automation\" (\"EDA\"). In mechanical design it is known as \"mechanical design automation\" (\"MDA\"), which includes the process of creating a technical drawing with the use of computer software.\nCAD software for mechanical design uses either vector-based graphics to depict the objects of traditional drafting, or may also produce raster graphics showing the overall appearance of designed objects. However, it involves more than just shapes. As in the manual drafting of technical and engineering drawings, the output of CAD must convey information, such as materials, processes, dimensions, and tolerances, according to application-specific conventions.\nCAD may be used to design curves and figures in two-dimensional (2D) space; or curves, surfaces, and solids in three-dimensional (3D) space.\nCAD is an important industrial art extensively used in many applications, including automotive, shipbuilding, and aerospace industries, industrial and architectural design (building information modeling), prosthetics, and many more. CAD is also widely used to produce computer animation for special effects in movies, advertising and technical manuals, often called DCC digital content creation. The modern ubiquity and power of computers means that even perfume bottles and shampoo dispensers are designed using techniques unheard of by engineers of the 1960s. Because of its enormous economic importance, CAD has been a major driving force for research in computational geometry, computer graphics (both hardware and software), and discrete differential geometry.\nThe design of geometric models for object shapes, in particular, is occasionally called computer-aided geometric design (CAGD).\nOverview.\nComputer-aided design is one of the many tools used by engineers and designers and is used in many ways depending on the profession of the user and the type of software in question.\nCAD is one part of the whole digital product development (DPD) activity within the product lifecycle management (PLM) processes, and as such is used together with other tools, which are either integrated modules or stand-alone products, such as:\nCAD is also used for the accurate creation of photo simulations that are often required in the preparation of environmental impact reports, in which computer-aided designs of intended buildings are superimposed into photographs of existing environments to represent what that locale will be like, where the proposed facilities are allowed to be built. Potential blockage of view corridors and shadow studies are also frequently analyzed through the use of CAD.\nTypes.\nThere are several different types of CAD, each requiring the operator to think differently about how to use them and design their virtual components in a different manner. Virtually all of CAD tools rely on constraint concepts that are used to define geometric or non-geometric elements of a model. \n2D CAD.\nThere are many producers of the lower-end 2D sketching systems, including a number of free and open-source programs. These provide an approach to the drawing process where scale and placement on the drawing sheet can easily be adjusted in the final draft as required, unlike in hand drafting.\n3D CAD.\n\"3D wireframe\" is an extension of 2D drafting into a three-dimensional space. Each line has to be manually inserted into the drawing. The final product has no mass properties associated with it and cannot have features directly added to it, such as holes. The operator approaches these in a similar fashion to the 2D systems, although many 3D systems allow using the wireframe model to make the final engineering drawing views.\n\"3D \"dumb\" solids\" are created in a way analogous to manipulations of real-world objects. Basic three-dimensional geometric forms (e.g., prisms, cylinders, spheres, or rectangles) have solid volumes added or subtracted from them as if assembling or cutting real-world objects. Two-dimensional projected views can easily be generated from the models. Basic 3D solids do not usually include tools to easily allow the motion of the components, set their limits to their motion, or identify interference between components.\nThere are several types of \"3D solid modeling\"\nFreeform CAD.\nTop-end CAD systems offer the capability to incorporate more organic, aesthetic and ergonomic features into the designs. Freeform surface modeling is often combined with solids to allow the designer to create products that fit the human form and visual requirements as well as they interface with the machine.\nTechnology.\nOriginally software for CAD systems was developed with computer languages such as Fortran, ALGOL but with the advancement of object-oriented programming methods this has radically changed. Typical modern parametric feature-based modeler and freeform surface systems are built around a number of key C modules with their own APIs. A CAD system can be seen as built up from the interaction of a graphical user interface (GUI) with NURBS geometry or boundary representation (B-rep) data via a geometric modeling kernel. A geometry constraint engine may also be employed to manage the associative relationships between geometry, such as wireframe geometry in a sketch or components in an assembly.\nUnexpected capabilities of these associative relationships have led to a new form of prototyping called digital prototyping. In contrast to physical prototypes, which entail manufacturing time in the design. That said, CAD models can be generated by a computer after the physical prototype has been scanned using an industrial CT scanning machine. Depending on the nature of the business, digital or physical prototypes can be initially chosen according to specific needs.\nToday, CAD systems exist for all the major platforms (Windows, Linux, UNIX and Mac OS X); some packages support multiple platforms.\nCurrently, no special hardware is required for most CAD software. However, some CAD systems can do graphically and computationally intensive tasks, so a modern graphics card, high speed (and possibly multiple) CPUs and large amounts of RAM may be recommended.\nThe human-machine interface is generally via a computer mouse but can also be via a pen and digitizing graphics tablet. Manipulation of the view of the model on the screen is also sometimes done with the use of a Spacemouse/SpaceBall. Some systems also support stereoscopic glasses for viewing the 3D model. Technologies that in the past were limited to larger installations or specialist applications have become available to a wide group of users. These include the CAVE or HMDs and interactive devices like motion-sensing technology\nSoftware.\nStarting with the IBM Drafting System in the mid-1960s, computer-aided design systems began to provide more capabilities than just an ability to reproduce manual drafting with electronic drafting, and the cost-benefit for companies to switch to CAD became apparent. The software automated many tasks that are taken for granted from computer systems today, such as automated generation of bills of materials, auto layout in integrated circuits, interference checking, and many others. Eventually, CAD provided the designer with the ability to perform engineering calculations. During this transition, calculations were still performed either by hand or by those individuals who could run computer programs. CAD was a revolutionary change in the engineering industry, where draftsman, designer, and engineer roles that had previously been separate began to merge. CAD is an example of the pervasive effect computers were beginning to have on the industry.\nCurrent computer-aided design software packages range from 2D vector-based drafting systems to 3D solid and surface modelers. Modern CAD packages can also frequently allow rotations in three dimensions, allowing viewing of a designed object from any desired angle, even from the inside looking out. Some CAD software is capable of dynamic mathematical modeling.\nCAD technology is used in the design of tools and machinery and in the drafting and design of all types of buildings, from small residential types (houses) to the largest commercial and industrial structures (hospitals and factories).\nCAD is mainly used for detailed design of 3D models or 2D drawings of physical components, but it is also used throughout the engineering process from conceptual design and layout of products, through strength and dynamic analysis of assemblies to definition of manufacturing methods of components. It can also be used to design objects such as jewelry, furniture, appliances, etc. Furthermore, many CAD applications now offer advanced rendering and animation capabilities so engineers can better visualize their product designs. 4D BIM is a type of virtual construction engineering simulation incorporating time or schedule-related information for project management.\nCAD has become an especially important technology within the scope of computer-aided technologies, with benefits such as lower product development costs and a greatly shortened design cycle. CAD enables designers to layout and develop work on screen, print it out and save it for future editing, saving time on their drawings.\nLicense management software.\nIn the 2000s, some CAD system software vendors shipped their distributions with a dedicated license manager software that controlled how often or how many users can utilize the CAD system.166 It could run either on a local machine (by loading from a local storage device) or a local network fileserver and was usually tied to a specific IP address in latter case.166\nList of software packages.\nCAD software enables engineers and architects to design, inspect and manage engineering projects within an integrated graphical user interface (GUI) on a personal computer system. Most applications support solid modeling with boundary representation (B-Rep) and NURBS geometry, and enable the same to be published in a variety of formats.\nBased on market statistics, commercial software from Autodesk, Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, Siemens PLM Software, and PTC dominate the CAD industry. The following is a list of major CAD applications, grouped by usage statistics.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
