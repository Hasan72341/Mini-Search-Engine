It aims to appeal to young listeners of alternative music, and plays far more Australian content than commercial networks.\nThe station was set up under the Whitlam government to extend the appeal of the ABC to young Australians. 2JJ or Double Jay began broadcasting in Sydney on 19 January 1975. It stood apart from commercial stations and rapidly garnered an audience due to its fringe rock music programming and lack of advertising. Following a transition to FM in 1981, the station rebranded to 2JJJ or Triple J and expanded regionally throughout the 1990s. Two spin-off digital stations were launched in the 2010s: Double J targets more mature audiences and Triple J Unearthed only plays local unsigned musicians.\nDespite declining radio ratings, Triple J continues to make a significant impact in the Australian music scene and has been historically praised for making popular culture accessible for young people across regional Australia. Triple J supports music festivals and concerts across the country, and organises its own events like One Night Stand. Every year it broadcasts the Hottest 100, a public poll of the years' most popular music, and runs the J Awards. Its music discovery platform, Unearthed, provides airplay opportunities for independent artists and has helped launch the careers of celebrated Australian musicians. As a taxpayer-funded entity, Triple J has also been criticised for its edgy identity and for promoting a homogenous music scene.\nHistory.\n1970s: Launch and early years.\nPlans.\nThe launch of a new, youth-focused radio station was a product of the progressive media policies of the Whitlam government of 1972\u201375. Prime minister Gough Whitlam wanted to set the station up to appeal to the youth vote, and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), worried about its declining audience, \"wanted a station for young people who would grow up to be ABC listeners.\" A new station was also a recommendation stemming from the McLean Report of 1974, which suggested expanding radio broadcasting onto the FM band, issuing a new class of broadcasting licence which permitted the establishment of community radio stations, and the creation of two new stations for the ABC: 2JJ in Sydney, referred to as Double Jay Rock and the short-lived 3ZZ in Melbourne.\nDouble Jay was intended to be the first link in Whitlam's planned national youth network, however, his administration was not re-elected in the 1975 federal election. The succeeding Fraser government's budget cuts to the ABC also halted this plan from moving forward. By the time 2JJ went to air, the Whitlam government was in its final months of office, and presenters on the station were frequently accused of left-wing bias in the months that followed.\nFirst broadcasts.\nDouble Jay commenced broadcasting at 11:00 am on Sunday, 19 January 1975, at 1540 kHz on the AM band. The station was restricted largely to the Greater Sydney region, and its local reception was hampered by inadequate transmitter facilities. However, its frequency was a clear channel nationally, so it was easily heard at night throughout south-eastern Australia. After midnight, 2JJ would use off-air ABC networks to increase its broadcasting range.\nIts first broadcast demonstrated a determination to distinguish itself from other Australian radio stations. The first on-air presenter, DJ Holger Brockmann, notably used his own name, which, at his previous role at 2SM, was considered \"too foreign-sounding\". After an introductory montage that featured sounds from the countdown and launch of Apollo 11, Brockmann launched the station's first broadcast with the words, \"Wow, and we're away!\", and then played Skyhooks' \"You Just Like Me 'Cos I'm Good in Bed\". The choice of this song to introduce the station was significant, as it represented several important features of the 2JJ brand at the time. Choosing an Australian band reflected the network's commitment to Australian content at a time when American acts dominated pop stations. Further, the song was one of several tracks from the Skyhooks' album that had been banned on commercial radio for its explicit sexual content. The station chose to play songs that were banned from commercial airwaves, including the Rolling Stones' \"Sympathy for the Devil\". Because 2JJ was a government-funded station operating under the umbrella of the ABC, it was not bound by commercial censorship codes, and was not answerable to advertisers nor the station owners. In contrast, their Sydney rival, 2SM, was owned by a holding company controlled by the Catholic Archdiocese of Sydney, resulting in the ban or editing of numerous songs.\nThe internal politics of 2JJ were considered a radical departure from the formats of commercial stations. 2JJ's presenters had almost total freedom in their on-air delivery, and all staff participated in major policy decisions. For example, as former announcer Gayle Austin reflected: \"In early March, women took over the station as announcers to celebrate International Women's Day\", and \"The listeners owned the station... and if they wanted to come to the meetings and join the debate, they were welcome\".\nIn its early years 2JJ's on-air staff were mainly recruited from either commercial radio or other ABC stations. In another first for the industry, their roster also featured presenters who did not come from a radio background, including singer-songwriters Bob Hudson and John J. Francis, and actor Lex Marinos. Other notable foundation staff and presenters in January 1975 were Chris Winter, Gayle Austin, Marius Webb, Ron Moss, Arnold Frolows, Mark Colvin, Jim Middleton, Don Cumming, and Mac Cocker. Alan McGirvan was the breakfast announcer. Early staff also included Ted Robinson, Chris Winter, and Jim Middleton. Marius Webb and Ron Moss were the station coordinators, while Ros Cheney was programme coordinator, and they established the workplace as kind of collective. Producer and programmer Sammy Collins later said of Cheney that she was \"more political and more dedicated than the men\", and it was her presence which enabled female representation at every level. Double Jay was the first Australian music radio station to allow women DJs; one of these was Gayle Austin.\nBefore the launch of Double Jay in Sydney, Melbourne was the undisputed capital of music; the new station shone the light on musicians from Sydney musicians, and publicised gigs happening in the city. The station played artists such as Midnight Oil, Radio Birdman, INXS, Mental As Anything, and AC/DC long before they had exposure on any other media.\nRise in popularity.\nThe station rapidly gained popularity, especially with its target youth demographic: media articles noted that in its first two months on air, 2JJ reached a 5.4% share of the total radio audience, with 17% in the 18\u201324 age group, while the audience share of rival 2SM dropped by 2.3%. Despite the poor quality of reception caused by the Sydney transmitter, the station still saw rapid growth. Austin explained that station staff threatened industrial action in July 1975 due to the transmitter issues, but officials of the BCB still refused to meet with 2JJ representatives. A new transmitter was not provided until 1980, following the transition to the FM band.\nAfter the station hosted an open-air concert in Liverpool, New South Wales, in May 1975 featuring Skyhooks and Dragon, city's \"Sun\" newspaper claimed that attendees were \"shocked\" by \"depictions of sexual depravity and shouted obscenities\", which allegedly caused women in the audience to clap their hands over their ears, prompting Coalition frontbencher Peter Nixon to call for the station to be closed down.\nDuring the 1970s, the music programming varied a lot and depended on the presenters and producers, with various factions favouring different artists and styles. There is also archival evidence of marijuana being used by presenters while on ABC grounds.\n1980s: Relaunch and national expansion.\nOn 11 July 1980, 2JJ began broadcasting on the FM band at a frequency of 105.7\u00a0MHz (again restricted to within the Greater Sydney region) and became 2JJJ, referred to as Triple J. The first song played was another track then banned from commercial radio, \"Gay Guys\" by the Dugites. To celebrate the relaunch, the station organised a concert in Parramatta Park on 18 January 1981, featuring Midnight Oil and Matt Finish, who performed to a crowd of 40,000 people.\nOn 19 January 1981, the AM transmissions ceased, and Triple J became an FM-only station. It was not until the 1989 that the ABC was finally able to expand to Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Darwin, Hobart, Melbourne, Newcastle, and Perth. During this period, there were attempts to establish a playlist for the whole station.\nIn 1990 the station took strike action after ABC management censored the N.W.A. song \"Fuck tha Police\". In retaliation, the presenters played N.W.A.'s song \"Express Yourself\" 82 times in a row. Triple M director Barry Chapman was appointed as general manager to oversee Triple J's network expansion and instil cultural change. His tenure generated controversy, most notably in 1990, when all senior announcers in the Sydney office were fired, including the most popular presenters Tony Biggs and Tim Ritchie. Several protests were held outside its William Street studios, including a 105-hour vigil, and a public meeting that packed the Sydney Town Hall with angry listeners spilled out onto the street. Listeners were concerned Chapman would bring a more commercial flair to Triple J with music programming that was less dominated by Sydney acts.\n1990s\u20132000s: Regional and digital expansion.\nThroughout the 1990s, Triple J commenced expansion to more regional areas of Australia and, in 1994, it was extended to another 18 regional centres throughout the country. In 1996, the total was brought to 44, with the new additions including Launceston, Tasmania; Albany, Western Australia; Bathurst, New South Wales and Mackay, Queensland. Triple J's most recent expansion was to Broome, Western Australia in 2005.\nFrom the 1990s until around 2010, Triple J \"set the cultural agenda, particularly for Australian music\". Grunge music came to the fore, and bands such as Spiderbait, the Beasts of Bourbon, and The Cruel Sea attained critical and popular success, boosted by Triple J's playlist.\nIn May 2003, Arnold Frolows, the only remaining member of the original 2JJ staff of 1975, stepped down after 28 years as Triple J music director. He was replaced by presenter Richard Kingsmill, who joined the station in 1988. Kingsmill had previously worked as a producer and presenter at 2SER alongside Robbie Buck and Tracee Hutchison.\nIn late 2004, the station's promotion for their annual Beat the Drum contest \u2013 in which listeners were to send in the most remarkable places they could promote the Triple J logo \u2013 caused brief controversy after it issued a promotional image of the former World Trade Center draped with a huge drum flag. A notable winner of the competition was a Queensland farmer who formed a drum logo-shaped crop circle in his wheat-fields.\nTriple J launched its own music magazine, \"JMag\" (later known as \"Triple J Magazine\"), in 2005. It was initially published quarterly, then monthly, but in 2013 the magazine ceased publication by News Custom Publishing. It returned as an annual edition, produced in-house, until 2016.\nAdapting to the digital streaming age, in 2004, the station began to release podcasts of some of its talkback shows, including \"Dr. Karl\", \"This Sporting Life\", and \"Hack\". In 2006, Triple J launched JTV (later rebranded to Triple J TV), a series of television programs broadcast on ABC1 and ABC2 including music videos, live concerts, documentaries, and comedy, as well as a behind-the-scenes look at Triple J's studios.\n2010s: Double J and Unearthed relaunches.\nIn 2006, the website for Triple J Unearthed was launched. It remains a hub for unsigned Australian artists to upload their music and be heard by the Triple J team. A digital radio station, which only plays content from the website, was launched in 2011.\nIn 2014, ABC's Dig Music digital radio station was rebranded under the Triple J umbrella, becoming Double J on 30 April 2014. The new station featured both new music and material from Triple J interview and sound archives. Former Triple J announcer Myf Warhurst, who hosted the inaugural shift, said \"it's for people who love music, and also love a bit of music history\". The first song played on Double J was Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds' \"Get Ready for Love\", followed by live performances by Australian artists Kate Miller-Heidke and Paul Dempsey.\nIn ratings released in August 2015, Triple J was the highest or equal first in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, and Perth in the 25\u201339 demographic.\nTriple J attracted significant news coverage in the lead-up to the Hottest 100 of 2017, when the station announced they would move the countdown date to the fourth weekend of January, rather than on Australia Day (26 January). The decision was taken after a listener petition and survey indicated that the majority of listeners would like it changed, owing to sensitivities in the community about celebrating the arrival of the First Fleet at Sydney Cove. The Hottest 100 has successfully broadcast on the fourth weekend of January (but not January 26) since 2018, with prominent campaigners A.B. Original calling the move \"a step in the right direction\".\n2020s: Kingsmill's departure and restructuring.\nTriple J began 2020 with a major overhaul of its hosts, replacing longtime presenters including Gen Fricker and Tom Tilley with younger talent including Bryce Mills and Lucy Smith, in what was billed as a \"generational shift for the station\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n \n did it hurt? when you aged out of the youth radio station\n 31 August 2021\nIn August 2021, the Triple J Twitter account posted a riff on a popular pick-up line, which attracted widespread criticism and accusations of ageism. Writing for \"NME,\" journalist Andrew P Street said the controversy renewed discussion about the lack of airplay of older artists on the station, with many being \"deemed Double J-ready\" in their mid-20s.\nAs radio ratings continue to decline across the board due to the rise of streaming media, Triple J saw a 2.5% decline of listeners across the major capital cities between late April and June 2022. Compared to the audience share of 7.7% in the Sydney 18\u201324 year-old demographic in 2021, the station had dropped to 4.4% in 2022.\nIn December 2023, it was announced that Richard Kingsmill, who had been the music director of Triple J and its sister stations, would be leaving after 35 years at the ABC. During his tenure, he doubled the amount of airtime given to Australian artists, from 30% to 60%, and increased the station's audience from 980,000 in 2006 to 3 million in 2022. Several news outlets, including \"The Guardian\" and \"Mumbrella\", wrote pieces about Kingsmill's importance to the Australian music scene, with Nathan Jolly of the latter calling the broadcaster \"the most important single figure in the history of Australian music\", on par with Michael Gudinski and Molly Meldrum.\nFormer head of the Nova network, Ben Latimer, was announced as the new head of radio at the ABC amidst a major board restructuring, causing audible \"shock and disappointment\" in a Sydney staff meeting. Several presenters also announced their departures, and long-running late night music show \"Good Nights\" was axed.\nIn May 2024, Triple J hosted the inaugural Bars of Steel Live event in Parramatta, showcasing hip hop and rap artists from all across Western Sydney. In September, the station also revived its One Night Stand regional music festival, which had not run since 2019. It took place in Warrnambool, Victoria to a sold-out crowd.\nIn January 2025, the station celebrated 50 years of existence. To celebrate the event, Double J broadcast the very first day of Triple J's 1975 broadcast, on 19 January 2025 from 11 am to 11 pm, with a two-hour simulcast on Triple J. Holger Brockmann introduced the replay. \"Rage\" also featured a birthday special in January 2025.\nA change to higher rotation for new music resulted in a jump in listenership in March 2025.\nMusic and identity.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOur brief was to provide an alternative to the mainstream, with a heavy emphasis on Australian content. We were to provide opportunities for live and recorded performances by young Australian musicians, and play (shock! horror!) album tracks from all the genres of music that weren't being heard on commercial radio.\nGayle Austin, \"Off the Dial\"\nIn the station's early years, Triple J primarily played alternative rock and pop rock, but the range of music programmed was far wider than its commercial rivals, encompassing both mainstream and alternative rock and pop, experimental and electronic music, progressive rock, funk, soul, disco, reggae, and the emerging ambient, punk and new wave genres of the late 1970s. Today, the station mostly plays modern rock, alt-pop, hip-hop and electronic music.\nTriple J initially positioned itself as a \"punk\" brand due to its fringe and often controversial music programming. The first song played on the station, \"You Just Like Me 'Cos I'm Good in Bed\" by Skyhooks, was banned from other Australian broadcasters due to its salacious content. The station had also been playing N.W.A's protest song \"Fuck tha Police\" for six months before ABC management caught on, who banned it in 1990. As a result, Triple J staff went on strike and put the group's song \"Express Yourself\" on continuous play for 24 hours, playing it roughly 82 times in a row.\nTriple J plays far more Australian music than its commercial rivals, and was a pioneer in its coverage of independent music. The station has always had a 40% Australian music quota, well above commercial radio's 25%\u2014mainstream radio has long been criticised for not playing enough local content. Early presenter Gayle Austin reflected in 2006 that before Triple J, \"Australian music didn't have much production put into it because there wasn't much money made out of it.\" In 2024, out of the 50 most played artists on Triple J, 33 were Australian, including eight in the top 10. Further, more than half of the acts included a non-male member. The most played act was indie pop duo Lime Cordiale.\nFor decades, Triple J has been criticised for apparently sounding too much like commercial radio and losing its distinct identity. According to Sam Whiting of \"The Conversation,\" it is a \"national pastime\" to critique the broadcaster for this exact reason. Writers have pointed to increased air time for international pop stars like Doja Cat, Olivia Rodrigo and Lil Nas X as proof of this, and that Billie Eilish's win in the 2018 Hottest 100 was an outcome \"unthinkable even a few years earlier.\" Similarly, Shaad D'Souza of \"The Guardian\" claims that in recent years, the station's programming has been dominated by garage-pop bands, and overall \"consistent to a fault.\" These criticisms tend to overlook the impact of genre shows like First Nations music show \"Blak Out\", and dance music show \"House Party\", as well as other published data about the changing sound of the station over time.\nMusic data.\nLaunched in 2006 by Paul Stipack, J Play was an online archive of every song played by Triple J over 12 years. It showed an artist's trajectory from their first airing to full rotation. The privately owned site was acquired by Seventh Street Media (Brag Media) along with music publications \"Tone Deaf\" and \"The Brag\", in early 2017. Owing to changes in the music industry, J Play's usefulness diminished, and it ceased operation in January 2019. The Brag Media retained the J Play database of 40,000 songs, 11,000 artists, and 15,000 playlists.\nIn June 2024, Sydney software engineer Harrison Khannah launched Triple J Watchdog, a similar online resource that tracks each week's top songs, musicians and genres, with additional statistics like artists' country of origin, pronouns and their amount of Spotify monthly listeners.\nBranding.\nThe Triple J name is stylised in all lowercase, a marketing decision made in 1981 that according to writer Ben Eltham of \"Meanjin\", is one that reflects \"a particular world-view that takes brand identity seriously\". Marketing staff will vet press releases and posters to ensure the broadcaster name is written as \"triple j\". In November 2024, the logos of Triple J and its sister stations were updated for the first time in 15 years. The long-running slogan of Triple J is \"We love music\", though \"We love Australian music\" has also been used.\nThe Triple J news theme is a \"very 90s remix\" of the classic ABC News theme \"Majestic Fanfare\". It was written and produced by Paul McKercher and John Jacobs in 1991, and is still used as of 2024. It contains a drum sample from Prince's \"Get Off\" and the record scratch from N.W.A's \"Fuck tha Police\", a nod to the track after it was banned by ABC management. This unconventional news theme is another core element of the Triple J brand identity\u2013 McKercher wanted to create a sound that was distinctly uncommercial.\nPrograms.\nTriple J's flagship Australian music program is \"Home and Hosed\", broadcast most weekday evenings. It features new local music, artist interviews, and concert news. On Sunday nights, \"Blak Out\" showcases the latest music from Indigenous Australians.\nAmong the station's live music segments is \"Like a Version\", which sees an artist performing an original and a cover song; \"Live at the Wireless\", featuring recordings from concerts and festivals; and \"Bars of Steel\", a web series featuring emerging rappers freestyling.\nMark Dodshon and Tracee Hutchison were key presenters on \"The Australian Music Show\" at 2JJJ in the 1980s. The program was a cornerstone of the station's commitment to promoting Australian music, showcasing emerging and established local artists. Dodshon and Hutchison brought their passion and expertise to the show, helping to uncover and celebrate new talent and cementing the program's reputation as a vital space for Australian artists.\nThrough the mid-to-late 1980s, Triple J pioneered special interest programs including the Japanese pop show \"Nippi Rock Shop\", Arnold Frolows' weekly late-night ambient music show \"Ambience\", and Jaslyn Hall's world music show, which was the first of its kind on Australian mainstream radio. Presenters like Graeme Bartlett and Tony Barrell experimented with the audio format and developed avant-garde programmes like \"Sunday Afternoon at the Movies\" (1976\u201377), \"Watching the Radio\" \"With The TV Off\" (1978\u201379) and \"Shipbuilding For Pleasure,\" which blended interviews, location sound recordings, music, and found audio to create layered narratives.\nNowadays, the station continues to broadcast several genre-specific music programs, including:\nNews updates on Triple J are written and edited from a youth-oriented perspective. \"Hack\", the station's flagship current affairs program, is broadcast every weekday evening and features investigations into relevant issues affecting young Australians.\nPresenters.\nMany early Triple J presenters went on to successful careers with commercial stations, the most notable being Doug Mulray, who honed his distinctive comedy-based style at the ABC before moving to rival FM rock station Triple M in the 1980s, where he became the most popular breakfast presenter in Sydney, and one of the highest-paid radio personalities in the country. Presenter Annette Shun Wah went on to host the popular \"Rock Around the World\" series on SBS and is now a program executive with SBS TV and producer of \"The Movie Show\". Reflecting on the station's 30 year anniversary in 2005, former presenter Steve Cannane said \"plenty of musos, comedians, announcers and journos got their start courtesy of the station.\"\nFrom July 2024, presenters on daily programs include:\nInitiatives.\nTriple J Unearthed.\nUnearthed is Triple J's initiative to support unsigned Australian artists. It began as a talent competition in 1996, which helped discover artists like Killing Heidi, Missy Higgins and Grinspoon. The Unearthed website was launched in 2006, allowing artists to upload their music to be heard by Triple J staff. It grew to host 30,000 artists and 250,000 users in its first five years. In 2011, an Unearthed digital radio station was launched, which only plays content from the website.\nUnearthed regularly hosts competitions to improve the recognition of independent artists, like Unearthed High, aimed at musicians in high school, with winners receiving mentoring, recording opportunities and airplay on Triple J. Past winners have included now-celebrated acts like Hockey Dad (2014), The Kid Laroi (2018), Genesis Owusu (2015) Japanese Wallpaper (2014) and Gretta Ray (2016).\nAusmusic Month.\nEvery November, Triple J celebrates Ausmusic Month, where Australian acts are heavily promoted across all its stations. A number of events are organised, including major concerts\u2014in 2010 this included headlining acts Bag Raiders and Ball Park Music and in 2018 featured performances from Paul Kelly, Crowded House and Missy Higgins. Triple J hosts the J Awards during the month, and encourages listeners to wear their favourite band's t-shirt on Ausmusic T-Shirt Day, an initiative which the station founded in 2013.\nJ Awards.\nThe J Awards are an annual awards ceremony held in November each year to celebrate Australian music. As of 2024, the five award categories are Australian Album of the Year, Australian Music Video of the Year, Australian Live Act of the Year, Unearthed Artist of the Year and Double J Artist of the Year. The most recent winners for Album of the Year are \"Angel in Realtime\" by Gang of Youths in 2022, \"Drummer\" by G Flip in 2023, \"Zorb\" by Sycco in 2024, and \"I Love My Computer\" by Ninajirachi in 2025.\nLive events.\nTriple J routinely sponsors live music events in Australia, and has organised its own festivals and concerts, including:\nImpact.\nArtist discovery.\nTriple J has substantial influence over the Australian music market and is a tastemaker. Since its inception, emerging artists it has championed have become some of the country's most celebrated musical acts, including Midnight Oil, Nick Cave, Silverchair and the John Butler Trio. The station is also credited for creating local audiences for international acts, like Blondie, Devo, Garbage and the B-52s\u2014Triple J was the first station in the world to play the latter's debut single \"Rock Lobster\".\nMore recently, artists platformed via the network's discovery channel, Triple J Unearthed, have included Flume, Missy Higgins, Vance Joy, Gang of Youths, Grinspoon and the Kid Laroi. Columnist Peter Vincent has written Triple J is \"the envy of the music scenes across the Western world, for its ability to deliver new local talent to mass audiences, quickly.\"\nThe station has faced accusations of having a monopoly on new music, with emerging acts heavily relying on their support for career growth. Notable musicians including Matty Healy of the 1975 and Andrew Stockdale of Wolfmother have both publicly criticised Triple J, despite enjoying extensive support from the station. Perth rock outfit End of Fashion claimed that reduced airplay ended the band's career.\nHomogenisation of music.\nTriple J has routinely been accused of promoting a homogeneous Australian music scene. Concerns were aired in Fairfax newspapers in 2014 with notable musicians, remaining anonymous, claiming artists needed the \"Triple J sound\" to be played on the station. Musician Whitley believed the broadcaster had failed to \"challenge and present new ideas for the youth of Australia.\" Music director Dave Ruby Howe acknowledged there were some similar sounds on discovery platform Unearthed, but bands purely chasing airplay would get caught out.\nMusic business.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOn any given day, hundreds of thousands of listeners across the country are tuned in. Label owners, promoters, publicists and musicians follow the station with relentless fascination, as its playlist and musical preferences can literally make, delay, or break careers in the notoriously fickle music business.\n Andrew McMillen\n, \"The Discovery Channel\", 6 January 2012\nTriple J has sponsored Australian live music events since its inception, and has organised its own festivals like Bars of Steel Live and One Night Stand, the latter of which has run in small regional towns since 2004. In 2024, Triple J and Double J supported over 60 festivals and tours of international and domestic artists. They promote such events in their radio programs and commercials and on their social media channels.\nIn its early years, Triple J also played an important role in record distribution. Labels would previously only import recordings that they knew would yield good commercial return, leaving them often unwilling to take risks on local releases. For example, Australian distributors initially refused to offer 801's live album \"801 Live\" in the country, but constant airplay on Triple J made the record the highest selling import album of the year. Thus, the label decided to release it locally.\nAlternative radio.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAs cringe-worthy as Triple J can sometimes be, the network is irreplaceable; it fills a unique niche in the Australian cultural landscape.\n Ben Eltham\n, \"The Curious Significance of Triple J\"\nTriple J's programming approach was copied by succeeding commercial stations. Nova, conceived as a competitor youth station, had a \"clearly borrowed\" catalogue from Triple J, but was slightly more conservative with its song selections.\nFormer Australian Recording Industry Association staffer Danny Yau said that Triple J's nationalisation from the early 1990s created a new role for local community radio stations, particularly Sydney's FBi and Melbourne's 3RRR, to fill the broadcaster's gaps with more niche regional content.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is also known by his shorter name, The Wizard.\nLife and career.\nEngland.\nThe Wizard was born Ian Brackenbury Channell on 4 December 1932 in London, England. He was educated at Framlingham College, Suffolk, and from 1945 to 1951 at Bromley Grammar School for Boys, now Ravensbourne School. In 1951, he was called up for national service in the Royal Air Force. Although he initially trained to be a pilot, he was later transferred to navigator training in Canada and was subsequently posted as the adjutant at RAF Duxford. He left the RAF in 1953 and became a sales representative for a paper merchant. In 1956, he married his girlfriend, Monica, and from 1958 spent two years teaching English in Iran. He then returned to England in order to attend the University of Leeds and graduated with a double honours degree in psychology and sociology in 1963. As a student at Leeds, he was a member of the institution's \"University Challenge\" team.\nAustralia.\nShortly after his graduation in 1963, he was recruited by the University of Western Australia Adult Education Board to run their community arts programme. In 1967, he became a teaching fellow at the newly opened School of Sociology at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. He was required to study towards a PhD thesis, but was informally promised a lectureship once completed.\nDuring this time he created a direct action reform movement called Alf (Action for Love and Freedom) and implemented what he called \"The Fun Revolution\". In 1968, he separated from his wife and his thesis was terminated due to insufficient progress. As his position was dependent on the continuation of his studies, he was consequently dismissed as a teaching fellow. The next year he was appointed as \"Wizard\" (effectively an events officer) of the University of New South Wales. He would also take on another persona, when elected as dictator of the student union. In late 1969, he was made Wizard by the World University Service of Australia and toured university campuses throughout 1970. He was able to persuade the Melbourne University Union Activities Department to appoint him their unpaid \"Cosmologer, Living Work of Art and Shaman\" in 1971. The vice-chancellor gave him the use of the Old Pathology Lecture Theatre for his classes in synthetic cosmology and the director of the National Gallery of Victoria accepted the offer of his live body as a living work of art. At this time, shocked when the student pacifist society sent money to the Viet Cong, he founded Alf's Imperial Army devoted to sensational but non-violent warfare and regularly organised battles on campus. He founded the Imperial British Conservative Party to provide a counterbalance to international capitalism and the various forms of Nazism. The Wizard produced an upside-down map using the Hobo\u2013Dyer projection which placed New Zealand and Australia top-centre.\nThe Wizard stood unsuccessfully in three Australian federal elections, contesting Sydney in 1969, and Kooyong in 1972 and 1974.\nNew Zealand.\nIn 1974, the Wizard migrated to Christchurch in New Zealand and began to speak on a ladder in Cathedral Square. The city council attempted to have him arrested, but he became so popular that they made the square a public speaking area. Wearing his costume as a false prophet of the Church of England, or his wizard's pointy hat, he has spoken there at lunchtimes in the summer months.\nHe confronted Telecom over the colour of public telephone boxes, played for the local rugby team, heckled Christian evangelist Ray Comfort, evaded the compulsory New Zealand census and performed rain dances in Canterbury, Auckland and the Australian outback.\nIn 1982, the New Zealand Art Gallery directors association issued a statement that in their opinion the Wizard was an authentic living work of art and the city council appointed him \"Wizard of Christchurch\". In 1990, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Mike Moore, an old friend, appointed him the official \"Wizard of New Zealand\".\nWith the help of the mayor, Vicki Buck, the city of Christchurch hosted a wizards' conclave in 1995 when visiting colleagues gathered to help build a wizard's nest on top of the university library tower, to witness the Wizard hatching from a giant egg in the city art gallery, sky diving whilst chanting a spell for a major rugby match and performing various rituals round the city. Soon afterwards, accompanied by 49 assistant wizards, he came down by gondola from the Port Hills with tablets bearing the address of his new website.\nHe initially provided his services free. In 1998, the Christchurch City Council signed a contract with him to \"provide acts of wizardry and other wizard-like-services \u2013 as part of promotional work for the city of Christchurch\" for an annual fee of $16,000. The Wizard also received financial support from his partner, Alice Flett. In 1998, an autobiography titled \"My Life as a Miracle\" was published.\nOn 8 September 2003, the Wizard's large wooden house was destroyed by a fire, which Christchurch police treated as arson. The \"Wizardmobile\", constructed from the front halves of two VW Beetles, was also attacked and damaged. The Wizard was awarded the Queen's Service Medal in the 2009 Queen's Birthday Honours for service to the community.\nAfter the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, the Wizard planned to retire and permanently leave Christchurch, saying that the town he loved had gone and that it was the end of an era. After it was announced by the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority and the Anglican bishop that the remains of Christchurch Cathedral would be demolished, the Wizard returned to Christchurch to oppose the demolition. The Wizard continues to speak on the need to preserve Christchurch's heritage buildings.\nBetween 2014 and 2021, Ari Freeman was the Wizard's apprentice. He distanced himself from the Wizard due to the latter's \"divisive politics\" and public comments about women and drag storytime events.\nIn October 2021, the Christchurch City Council ended its contract with the Wizard after two decades of service. The Wizard said he was disappointed but will continue to appear in the city. The Wizard stood as a candidate in the 2022 Christchurch mayoral election, receiving 2,474 votes and coming in fifth place.\nDocumentaries.\n\"The Wizard of New Zealand QSM\", directed by Grant John Neville and director of photography Karlos Filipov, includes interviews with the Wizard, Mike Moore and many others. Among other topics, the documentary details the Wizard's views that women cause wars through their shopping habits and that governments with monarchies are more stable. It was awarded Best Short Documentary at the Beijing International Film Festival 2010, and Best Film about Real People at the Official Best of Fest 2010.\n\"The Wizard and the Commodore \u2013 Chathams Islands/New Zealand\", directed by Samuel A. Miller, follows the subject on a trip to the Chatham Islands, about 900\u00a0km east of mainland New Zealand. The film premiered on 1 July 2016 in New Zealand.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The screenplay, credited to William Roberts, is a remake \u2013 in an Old West-style \u2013 of Akira Kurosawa's 1954 Japanese film \"Seven Samurai\" (itself initially released in the United States as \"The Magnificent Seven\"). The ensemble cast includes Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn, Brad Dexter, James Coburn, and Horst Buchholz as a group of seven gunfighters hired to protect a small village in Mexico from a group of marauding bandits led by Eli Wallach.\nThe film was released by United Artists on October 12, 1960, becoming both a critical and commercial success and has been appraised as one of the greatest films of the Western genre. It spawned three sequels, a television series that aired from 1998 to 2000, and a 2016 film remake. Elmer Bernstein's film score was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score and is listed on the American Film Institute's list of the top 25 American film scores.\nIn 2013, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nPlot.\nA gang of bandits led by Calvera periodically raids a poor Mexican village for food and supplies. After the latest raid, during which Calvera kills a villager, the village leaders decide to consult the only man they believe has the wisdom to help them- an elder who lives as a hermit (outside their village area). The elder advises them to fight back, and to buy weapons, and if they have no money for weapons, to seek help from other towns where weapons can be gotten.\nThey send three villagers carrying their few objects of value to try and barter for weapons. In a town just inside the United States, the villagers find and approach gunslinger Chris Adams. Chris advises that they instead hire gunfighters to defend the village, as \"men are cheaper than guns.\"\nAt first agreeing only to help them recruit, Chris eventually leads the group. Despite the meager pay, Chris finds five willing gunmen. They include Vin Tanner, a gunfighter gone broke from gambling; Chris' friend Harry Luck, who assumes Chris is hiding a much bigger reward for the work; the Irish Mexican Bernardo O'Reilly, who has fallen on hard times; Britt, an expert in both knife and gun who joins purely for the challenge involved; and the dapper, on-the-run gunman Lee, plagued by nightmares of fallen enemies and so haunted that he has lost his nerve for battle. On their way to the village, they are trailed by the hotheaded Chico, an aspiring gunfighter whose previous attempts to join Chris had been spurned. Impressed by his persistence, Chris allows him into the group.\nArriving at the village, they work with the villagers to build fortifications and train them in combat. They note the lack of young women in the village until Chico stumbles upon Petra and discovers the women were hidden in fear that the gunmen would rape them. The gunmen begin to bond with the villagers, and Petra pursues Chico. When Bernardo points out that the gunmen are being given the choice food, they share it with the village children.\nThree of Calvera's men are dispatched to reconnoiter the village; due to a mistake by Chico, the seven are forced to kill all three. Some days later Calvera and his bandits arrive in force. The seven and the villagers kill eleven gang members and run the rest out of town. The villagers celebrate, believing Calvera will not return. However, Chico infiltrates Calvera's camp and learns that Calvera will return, as his men are short of food. Some villagers fear reprisals and call for the gunfighters to leave. Even some of the seven waver, but Chris insists that they stay.\nThe seven ride out for a pre-emptive raid on Calvera's camp but find it abandoned. Returning to the village, they are captured by Calvera and his men, who have colluded with some of the villagers to sneak in and take control. Calvera spares the seven's lives, part believing they have been disillusioned by the betrayal, and part fearing reprisals from their friends across the border.\nPreparing to depart, Chris and Vin admit they have become emotionally attached to the village. Britt declares that no man will take his gun and see him ride away. Chico insists that he hates the villagers; when Chris points out he grew up as a farmer as well, Chico angrily responds that it is men like Calvera and Chris who made the villagers what they are.\nThe gang escorts the seven gunmen from the village and returns their weapons. The seven debate their next move. All agree to return and fight, except Harry, who believes the effort is futile and suicidal.\nThe gunmen infiltrate the village and a gunfight breaks out. Harry, who has had a change of heart, returns in time to save Chris's life but is himself fatally shot. Harry pleads to know what they were fighting for, and Chris lies about hidden gold to let Harry believe he died for a fortune; Harry smiles before dying. Lee finds the nerve to burst into a house where several villagers are being held, shooting their captors and releasing the prisoners to join the fight, but is gunned down as he leaves the house. Bernardo, shot protecting the boys he befriended, tells them as he dies to see how bravely their fathers fought. Britt dies after killing many bandits and exposing himself from cover. Chris shoots Calvera, who demands to know why he came back for the village. The remaining bandits flee.\nChris, Vin, and Chico bid farewell to the village elder. The elder tells them that only the villagers have won, whereas the gunslingers are \"like the wind, blowing over the land and passing on.\" As they pause for one last glance back at the village, Chico decides to stay with Petra. As they pass the graves of their fallen comrades, Chris admits the elder was right.\nCast.\nThe Seven.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOthers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nLou Morheim acquired rights to remake the film in the US for $2,500. He later signed a deal with Yul Brynner's production company, who bought the rights from Morheim for $10,000 up front plus $1,000 a week as a producer and 5% of the net profits. Anthony Quinn was lined up to star with Brynner as director but later Martin Ritt was appointed as director with Brynner starring.\nBrynner approached producer Walter Mirisch with the idea of remaking Kurosawa's famous samurai film. However, once Mirisch had acquired the rights and finalized a deal with United Artists, Brynner was sued for breach of contract by Quinn, who claimed that he and Brynner had developed the concept together and had worked out many of the film's details before the two had a falling-out. Quinn ultimately lost his claim because there was nothing in writing.\nThe film's title comes from the initial American localized title of \"Seven Samurai\", which was initially released under the title \"The Magnificent Seven\" in the United States in 1955.\nWriting.\nScript credit was a subject of contention. Associate producer Morheim commissioned Walter Bernstein, a blacklisted scriptwriter, to produce the first draft \"faithfully\" adapted from the original script written by Shinobu Hashimoto, Hideo Oguni and Akira Kurosawa; when Mirisch and Brynner took over the production, they brought on Walter Newman, whose version \"is largely what's onscreen.\" When Newman was unavailable to be onsite during the film's principal photography in Mexico, William Roberts was hired, in part to make changes required by Mexican censors. When Roberts asked the Writers Guild of America for a co-credit, Newman asked that his name be removed from the credits.\nCasting.\nSturges was eager to cast Steve McQueen in the picture, having just worked with him on the 1959 film \"Never So Few\", but McQueen could not get a release from actor/producer Dick Powell, who controlled McQueen's hit TV series \"Wanted Dead or Alive\". On the advice of his agent, McQueen, an experienced race car driver, staged a car accident and claimed that he could not work on his series because he had suffered a whiplash injury and had to wear a neck brace. During the interval required for his \"recuperation\", he was free to appear in \"The Magnificent Seven\". James Coburn was a great fan of the Japanese film \"Seven Samurai\", having seen it 15 times, and was hired through the help of co-star and former classmate Robert Vaughn, after the role of the expert knifethrower had been rejected by actors Sterling Hayden and John Ireland.\nFilming.\nThe film was shot by cinematographer Charles Lang in a 35 mm anamorphic format using Panavision lenses. Location shooting began on March 1, 1960, in Mexico, where both the village and the U.S. border town were built for the film. The location filming was in Cuernavaca, Durango, and Tepoztl\u00e1n and at the Estudios Churubusco. The first scenes were the first part of the six gunfighters' journey to the Mexican village prior to Chico being brought into the group.\nDuring filming there was considerable tension between Brynner and McQueen, who was displeased at his character having only seven lines of dialogue in the original shooting script. (Sturges had told McQueen that he would \"give him the camera\".) To compensate, McQueen took numerous opportunities to upstage Brynner and draw attention to himself, including shielding his eyes with his hat, flipping a coin during one of Brynner's speeches, and rattling his shotgun shells. Brynner would often build up a little mound of earth to make himself look as tall as McQueen, only to have McQueen kick the dirt out of place when he passed by. When newspapers started reporting about a rivalry, Brynner issued a press statement saying, \"I never feud with actors. I feud with studios.\"\nIn an interview Eli Wallach recalled his own interaction with fellow players: \"Bronson was a loner. He kept to himself. I liked Robert Vaughn and James Coburn very much. Vaughn is a very intelligent guy. He wrote a book on blacklisting. Coburn was one of those quiet types which fit his character very well: silent but a knife thrower of great skill.\"\nMusic.\nSoundtrack.\nThe film's score is by Elmer Bernstein, with orchestrations by Leo Shuken and Jack Hayes. Along with the readily recognized main theme and effective support of the story line, the score also contains allusions to twentieth-century symphonic works, such as the reference to Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra, second movement, in the tense quiet scene just before the shootout. The original soundtrack was not released at the time until reused and rerecorded by Bernstein for the soundtrack of \"Return of the Seven\". Electric guitar cover versions by Al Caiola in the U.S. and John Barry in the U.K. were successful on the popular charts. A vocal theme not written by Bernstein was used in a trailer.\nIn 1994, James Sedares conducted a re-recording of the score performed by The Phoenix Symphony Orchestra, which also included a suite from Bernstein's score for \"The Hallelujah Trail\", issued by Koch Records; Bernstein himself conducted the Royal Scottish National Orchestra for a performance released by RCA in 1997, but the original film soundtrack was not released until the following year by Rykodisc. (Var\u00e8se Sarabande issued this album in 1996, and reissued it in 2004.)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAt the 33rd Academy Awards, the score was nominated for Best Score of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture, losing to Ernest Gold's score for \"Exodus\". In 2005, the score for \"The Magnificent Seven\" was listed at No. 8 on the American Film Institute's list of the top 25 American film scores.\nIn other media.\nBernstein's score has frequently been quoted in the media and popular culture. Starting in 1963, the theme was used in commercials in the U.S. for Marlboro cigarettes for many years. The 1965 movie \"The Sons of Katie Elder\" used much of the same music. In the James Bond film Moonraker, the theme is used as Bond is riding through Rio de Janeiro. In the 2005 film \"The Ringer\"; in the 2015 film \"Hardcore Henry\"; as entrance music for the British band James, as well as episodes of \"The Simpsons\" that had a \"Western\" theme (mainly in the episode titled \"Dude, Where's My Ranch?\"). The opening horn riff in Arthur Conley's 1967 hit \"Sweet Soul Music\" is borrowed from the theme. Canadian band Kon Kan use the opening bars of the theme in their single \"I Beg Your Pardon\". Celtic Football Club (Glasgow, Scotland) used the theme music whenever Henrik Larsson scored a goal. The 2008 J-pop song \"\u014cgoe Diamond\" by AKB48 also used part of the main theme.\nUnited States.\nThe \"Cheers\" episode \"Diane Chambers Day\" (season 4, episode 22) revolves around the bar denizens being invited to watch \"The Magnificent Seven\" and ends with them singing an \"a cappella\" version of the theme.\nThe Mick Jones 1980s band Big Audio Dynamite covered the song as \"Keep off the Grass\", although this cover was not officially released. In 1995, the KLF also did a drum and bass cover of the main title as \"The Magnificent\"; it was released under the group alias One World Orchestra on the charity compilation \"The Help Album\".\nIn 1992, the main theme of \"The Magnificent Seven\" came into use on a section of the Disneyland Railroad at Disneyland Paris. Portions of the theme play as the train exits the Grand Canyon diorama tunnel behind Phantom Manor, enters Frontierland, and travels along the bank of the Rivers of the Far West.\nThe \"Main Title\" was used as an intro tune on many nights of Bruce Springsteen's 2012 Wrecking Ball World Tour. The theme was played as the E Street Band entered the stage, adding to the dramatic atmosphere in the stadium.\nTheatrical release.\nThe film opened on October 12, 1960, in a thousand theaters across the South and Southwest of the United States.\nReception.\nBox office.\nIn the United States and Canada, the film earned US$2.25\u00a0million in theatrical rentals and was a box office disappointment, but proved to be such a smash hit in Europe that it ultimately made a profit. The overseas rental was almost three times as much as in the U.S. with a total of $7.5 million, giving it worldwide rentals of $9.75 million. It was the second biggest hit of the year at the British box office in 1961.\nIn Western Europe, the film sold 7.3\u00a0million tickets in Italy, 7,037,826 tickets in France, and 7.7\u00a0million tickets in the United Kingdom, becoming one of the top 100 highest-grossing films in the United Kingdom and in France. It was also successful in Germany. In the Soviet Union (where Brynner was originally from), the film sold 67\u00a0million tickets, becoming the highest-grossing Hollywood film ever in the Soviet Union (where it was among only a handful of Hollywood films to become blockbusters there). In South Korea, it sold 80,870 tickets in Seoul City, and it was also successful in Japan. This adds up to a total of at least 89,118,696 tickets sold in overseas territories.\nCritical response.\nContemporary reviews were mixed to positive. Howard Thompson of \"The New York Times\" called the film a \"pallid, pretentious and overlong reflection of the Japanese original\"; according to Thompson, \"don't expect anything like the ice-cold suspense, the superb juxtaposition of revealing human vignettes and especially the pile-driver tempo of the first \"Seven\".\" According to \"Variety\", \"Until the women and children arrive on the scene about two-thirds of the way through, \"The Magnificent Seven\" is a rip-roaring rootin' tootin' western with lots of bite and tang and old-fashioned abandon. The last third is downhill, a long and cluttered anti-climax in which \"The Magnificent Seven\" grow slightly too magnificent for comfort.\" Richard L. Coe of \"The Washington Post\" called the film \"rough, tough, funny and splashy most of the way. There's a serious dip the final third, but Keith's newcomer offers shrewd, vastly enjoyable performances.\" \"Harrison's Reports\" praised the film as \"A superb Western, well acted and crammed full of action, human interest, pathos, suspense, plus some romance and humor.\"\nA positive review from Charles Stinson in the \"Los Angeles Times\" praised the dialogue as \"by turns, virile, rowdily funny and then, abruptly, not always predictably, it is pensive, even gentle. John Sturges' direction is superbly staccato; making a knife-sharp use of pauses and silences, it brings out both the humor and melancholy, the humanity as well as the evil inherent in the situation.\" \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" called the casting of Yul Brynner and Horst Buchholz \"curious\" and thought Chico's decision to stay put was \"the film's most completely unbelievable contrivance,\" but still thought that \"the film manages to be both impressive and likeable.\"\nAkira Kurosawa was reportedly so impressed by the film that he presented John Sturges with a sword, but said: \"The American copy is a disappointment. Although entertaining, it is not a version of Seven Samurai.\"\nThe film has grown greatly in esteem since its release, partly as several of its cast went on to become superstars, and its music score, but also due to the quality of the script. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval score of 89% based on 44 reviews, with an average rating of 8.00/10. The consensus reads, \"\"The Magnificent Seven\" transplants \"Seven Samurai\" into the Old West with a terrific cast of Hollywood stars\u2014and without losing any of the story's thematic richness.\" It is the second most shown film in U.S. television history, behind only \"The Wizard of Oz\". The film is also ranked No. 79 on the AFI's list of American cinema's 100 most-thrilling films.\nOther media.\nSequels.\nThree sequels were eventually made: \"Return of the Seven\" (1966), \"Guns of the Magnificent Seven\" (1969), and \"The Magnificent Seven Ride!\" (1972). Yul Brynner returned as Chris Adams for \"Return of the Seven\", but was replaced in the sequels by George Kennedy and Lee Van Cleef. He was the only member of the cast to return for any of the sequels. None were as successful as the original film.\nTelevision series.\nThe film also inspired a television series, \"The Magnificent Seven\", which ran from 1998 to 2000. Robert Vaughn was a recurring guest star, a judge who hires the seven to protect the town in which his widowed daughter-in-law and his grandson live.\nMusic.\nIn 1981, The Clash released a song, \"The Magnificent Seven\", the third single from their fourth album, \"Sandinista!\", which references the title of the 1960 film.\nUnofficial remake.\nThe 1980 science fiction film \"Battle Beyond the Stars\" was a remake of \"The Magnificent Seven\" set in space. A group of mercenaries, including ones played by George Peppard (as a character known only as \"Space Cowboy\") and Robert Vaughn (playing essentially the same character as in \"The Magnificent Seven\") defend farmers from space raiders on the planet Akir, home of the Akira (named after \"Seven Samurai\" director Akira Kurosawa).\nRemake.\n\"The Magnificent Seven\", a remake of the film with the same title, was released in 2016, directed by Antoine Fuqua and starring Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, Ethan Hawke, Vincent D'Onofrio, Lee Byung-hun, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Martin Sensmeier and Peter Sarsgaard.\nAs of 2023, MGM has begun considering rebooting many of its film franchises, including a TV adaptation of \"The Magnificent Seven\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its screenplay was written by Age &amp; Scarpelli, Luciano Vincenzoni, and Leone (with additional screenplay material and dialogue provided by an uncredited Sergio Donati), based on a story by Vincenzoni and Leone. Director of photography Tonino Delli Colli was responsible for the film's sweeping widescreen cinematography, and Ennio Morricone composed the film's score. It was an Italian-led production with co-producers in Spain, West Germany, and the United States. Most of the filming took place in Spain, notably, though not exclusively, in the Tabernas Desert in Almer\u00eda; in the Arlanza River valley near Hortig\u00fcela; and at the purpose-built Sad Hill Cemetery near Santo Domingo de Silos.\nThe film is known for Leone's use of long shots and close-up cinematography, as well as his distinctive use of violence, tension, and highly stylised gunfights. The plot revolves around three gunslingers competing to find a fortune in a buried cache of Confederate gold amid the violent chaos of the American Civil War (specifically the Battle of Glorieta Pass of the New Mexico campaign in 1862) while participating in many battles, confrontations, and duels along the way. The film was the third collaboration between Leone and Eastwood, and the second of those with Van Cleef.\n\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" was marketed in the United States as the third and final installment in the \"Dollars Trilogy\", following \"A Fistful of Dollars\" (1964) and \"For a Few Dollars More\" (1965). The film was a financial success, grossing over $38\u00a0million at the worldwide box office, and is credited with having catapulted Eastwood into stardom. Due to general disapproval of the spaghetti Western genre at the time, some critics dismissed the movie, but it soon garnered critical praise, and is now widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential westerns of all time.\nPlot.\nIn the American Southwest during the Civil War, a mercenary known as \"Angel Eyes\" interrogates a former Confederate soldier to learn the alias of a man who stole a stash of Confederate gold. The soldier, Stevens, reveals the man's alias \"Bill Carson\" and attempts to bribe Angel Eyes to kill his employer, then draws on him. Angel Eyes kills him and, returning to his employer, kills him as well.\nMexican bandit Tuco Ramirez, fleeing from bounty hunters, is captured by an unnamed drifter he nicknames \"Blondie\" who delivers him to a sheriff and collects the bounty. As Tuco is about to be hanged, Blondie severs the noose with a rifle bullet and the two escape to split the bounty. They repeat the process in another town but Blondie grows weary of Tuco's complaints, keeps the money, and strands Tuco in the desert.\nBent on revenge, Tuco reassembles his gang and tracks down Blondie. Although his gang dies in a failed ambush, Tuco captures Blondie in his hotel room. An artillery round destroys the room and allows Blondie to escape. Tuco recaptures Blondie after a lengthy pursuit and force-marches him through the desert until he collapses from dehydration. A runaway ambulance arrives with several dead Confederate soldiers and Bill Carson. Near death, Carson begs Tuco for help, offering $200,000 in gold buried in Sad Hill Cemetery. When Tuco returns with water, Carson has died, having revealed the exact location of the gold to Blondie. \nThe two reluctantly agree to work together, unwilling to disclose their knowledge of the gold's location. They pose as Confederate soldiers at a mission while Blondie recovers and Tuco reunites with his brother, a priest, who rejects Tuco. They leave the mission and are taken prisoner by Union cavalry. Tuco gives the name Bill Carson, alerting Angel Eyes, who has infiltrated the POW camp as a Union sergeant. Tuco is tortured into revealing the cemetery's name and sent away to be hanged. Knowing torture won't work on Blondie, Angel Eyes joins forces with him. Tuco escapes from custody and tracks Angel Eyes' gang to a ghost town.\nDistrusting of Angel Eyes, Blondie finds Tuco and kill the gang members, but Angel Eyes escapes. Tuco and Blondie witness a battle over a strategic bridge they need to cross, and blow it up to disperse the armies and clear their path. As they wire the bridge with explosives, Tuco suggests they exchange their secrets in case either is killed. Tuco reveals the cemetery's name, and Blondie says \"Arch Stanton\" is the name on the grave.\nAfter the bridge is demolished, Tuco rushes towards Sad Hill to claim the gold for himself. Blondie catches up to him as he digs up the grave, and Angel Eyes arrives soon after. When no gold is found in the grave, Blondie admits lying about the name. He then places a stone in the middle of the cemetery's pavement, on which he says the true name is written. The three men face each other in a Mexican standoff. Angel Eyes draws first, but Blondie shoots him before he can fire. Tuco finds that his gun is empty and, as Blondie walks confidently toward him, realizes that Blondie unloaded it earlier.\nBlondie reveals that the gold is in the grave marked \"Unknown\" beside Stanton's. After Tuco digs up several large bags of gold, Blondie orders him at gunpoint into a hangman's noose. With hands bound, Tuco stands atop a rickety grave marker while Blondie takes half the gold and rides away. As Tuco screams for mercy, Blondie severs the rope with a rifle shot, dropping Tuco face-first onto the remaining gold. Tuco furiously curses Blondie, who smiles before riding over the nearby hills.\nCast.\nSupporting cast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;*Al Mulock as Elam, a one-armed bounty-hunter\nProduction.\nPre-production.\nAfter the success of \"For a Few Dollars More\", executives at United Artists approached the film's screenwriter, Luciano Vincenzoni, to sign a contract for the rights to the film and the production of its sequel. Along with producers Alberto Grimaldi and Sergio Leone, Vincenzoni pitched an idea about \"a film about three rogues who are looking for some treasure at the time of the American Civil War\". An agreement was struck with UA for a million-dollar budget, with the studio advancing $500,000 upfront and 50% of the box-office takings outside of Italy. The total budget was eventually increased to $1.2 million.\nAs Leone developed Vincenzoni's idea into a script, he built upon the screenwriter's original concept to \"show the absurdity of war... the Civil War, which the characters encounter. In my frame of reference, it is useless, stupid: it does not involve a 'good cause',\" saying, \"I had read somewhere that 120,000 people died in Southern camps such as Andersonville. Many shots in the film were influenced by archival Civil War photographs taken by Mathew Brady and Alexander Gardner. As the film took place during the Civil War, it served as a prequel for the other two films in the trilogy, which took place after the war. The three main characters all contain autobiographical elements of Leone.\nFilm director Alex Cox suggested that the cemetery-buried gold hunted by the protagonists may have been inspired by rumours surrounding the anti-Communist Gladio organisation, who hid many of their 138 weapons caches in cemeteries.\nThe film's working title was \"I due magnifici straccioni\" (\"The Two Magnificent Tramps\"). It was changed just before shooting began, when Vincenzoni thought of \"Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo\" (\"The Good, the Ugly, the Bad\"), which Leone loved. In the United States, United Artists considered using the original Italian translation, \"River of Dollars\", or \"The Man With No Name\", but decided on \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\".\nCasting.\nAfter Leone offered Clint Eastwood a role in his next movie, traveling to California to persuade him, Eastwood agreed to make the film, playing Blondie, upon being paid $250,000 and receiving 10 percent of the profits from the North American markets\u2014a deal with which Leone was not happy.\nThe director originally considered Gian Maria Volont\u00e9 (who portrayed the villains in both the preceding films) for the role of Tuco, but felt that the role required someone with \"natural comic talent\". In the end, Leone chose Eli Wallach, based on his role in the \"Railroads\" scene of \"How the West Was Won\" (1962). Upon meeting Leone, Wallach was sceptical about playing this type of character again, but immediately agreed after Leone screened the opening credit sequence from \"For a Few Dollars More\". The two men got along well, sharing the same bizarre sense of humour. Leone allowed Wallach to make changes to his character in terms of his outfit and recurring gestures. Both Eastwood and Van Cleef realised that the character of Tuco was close to Leone's heart, and the director and Wallach also became good friends. They communicated in French, which Wallach spoke badly and Leone spoke well. Van Cleef observed, \"Tuco is the only one of the trio the audience gets to know all about. We meet his brother and find out where he came from and why he became a bandit.\"\nFor the role of Angel Eyes, Leone originally wanted Enrico Maria Salerno (who had dubbed Eastwood's voice for the Italian versions of the \"Dollars Trilogy\" films) or Charles Bronson, but the latter was already committed to playing in \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967). Leone eventually wished to work with Lee Van Cleef again, saying, \"I said to myself that Van Cleef had first played a romantic character in \"For a Few Dollars More.\" The idea of getting him to play a character who was the opposite of that began to appeal to me.\"\nFilming.\nProduction began at the Cinecitt\u00e0 studio in Rome mid-May 1966. It then moved on to Spain's northern plateau region near Burgos, which doubled for the Southwestern United States, and again in southern Spain's Almer\u00eda. The production required elaborate sets, including a town under cannon fire, an extensive prison camp, and an American Civil War battlefield; for the climax, several hundred Spanish soldiers were employed to build a cemetery with several thousand gravestones and wooden crosses to resemble an ancient Roman circus. A scene where a bridge was blown up had to be filmed twice because the explosion destroyed all three cameras in the first take.\nItalian cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli was brought in to shoot the film and was prompted by Leone to pay more attention to lighting than in the previous two films. The score was once again composed by Ennio Morricone, and for the final Mexican standoff scene in the cemetery, Leone asked Morricone to compose what felt like \"the corpses were laughing from inside their tombs\". Filming concluded in July 1966.\nEastwood was displeased with the script and was concerned he might be upstaged by Wallach. \"In the first film, I was alone,\" he told Leone. \"In the second, we were two. Here we are three. If it goes on this way, in the next one I will be starring with the American cavalry.\" As Eastwood played hard-to-get in accepting the role (inflating his earnings up to $250,000, two Ferraris, and 10% of the profits in the United States when eventually released there), he was again encountering publicist disputes between Ruth Marsh, who urged him to accept the third film of the trilogy, and the William Morris Agency and Irving Leonard, who were unhappy with Marsh's influence on the actor. Eastwood banished Marsh from having any further influence in his career, and he fired her as his business manager.\nWallach and Eastwood flew to Madrid together, and between shooting scenes, Eastwood would relax and practice his golf swing. Wallach was almost poisoned during filming when he accidentally drank from a bottle of acid that a film technician had set next to his soda bottle. Wallach mentioned this in his autobiography and complained that while Leone was a brilliant director, he was very lax about ensuring the safety of his actors during dangerous scenes. For instance, in one scene, where he was to be hanged after a pistol was fired, the horse underneath him was supposed to bolt. While the rope around Wallach's neck was severed, the horse was frightened a little too well. It galloped for about a mile with Wallach still mounted and his hands bound behind his back. The third time Wallach's life was threatened was during the scene where Mario Brega and he\u2014who are chained together\u2014jump out of a moving train. The jumping part went as planned, but Wallach's life was endangered when his character attempts to sever the chain binding him to the (now dead) soldier. Tuco places the body on the railroad tracks, waiting for the train to roll over the chain and sever it. Wallach, and presumably the entire film crew, were not aware of the heavy iron steps that jutted one foot out of every box car. If Wallach had stood up from his prone position at the wrong time, one of the jutting steps could have decapitated him.\nThe bridge in the film was constructed twice by sappers of the Spanish army and rigged for on-camera explosive demolition. On the first occasion, an Italian camera operator signalled that he was ready to shoot, which was misconstrued by an army captain as the similar-sounding Spanish word meaning \"start\". Nobody was injured in the resulting explosion. The army rebuilt the bridge while other shots were filmed. As the bridge was not a prop, but a rather heavy and sturdy functional structure, powerful explosives were required to destroy it. Leone said that this scene was, in part, inspired by Buster Keaton's silent film \"The General\".\nAs an international cast was employed, actors performed in their native languages. Eastwood, Van Cleef, and Wallach spoke English and were dubbed into Italian for their debut release in Rome. For the American version, the lead acting voices were used, but supporting cast members were dubbed into English. The result is noticeable in the bad synchronisation of voices to lip movements on screen; none of the dialogue is completely in sync because Leone rarely shot his scenes with synchronised sound. Various reasons have been cited for this: Leone often liked to play Morricone's music over a scene and possibly shout things at the actors to get them in the mood. Leone cared more for visuals than dialogue (his English was limited at best). Given the technical limitations of the time, recording the sound cleanly would have been difficult in most of the extremely wide shots Leone frequently used. Also, it was standard practice in Italian films at this time to shoot silently and post-dub. Whatever the actual reason, all dialogue in the film was recorded in postproduction.\nBy the end of filming, Eastwood had finally had enough of Leone's perfectionist directorial traits. Leone insisted, often forcefully, on shooting scenes from many different angles, paying attention to the most minute of details, which often exhausted the actors. Leone, who was obese, prompted amusement through his excesses, and Eastwood found a way to deal with the stresses of being directed by him by making jokes about him and nicknamed him \"Yosemite Sam\" for his bad temper. After the film was completed, Eastwood never worked with Leone again, later turning down the role of Harmonica in \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" (1968), for which Leone had personally flown to Los Angeles to give him the script. The role eventually went to Charles Bronson. Years later, Leone exacted his revenge upon Eastwood during the filming of \"Once Upon a Time in America\" when he described Eastwood's abilities as an actor as being like a block of marble or wax and inferior to the acting abilities of Robert De Niro, saying, \"Eastwood moves like a sleepwalker between explosions and hails of bullets, and he is always the same\u2014a block of marble. Bobby, first of all, is an actor, and Clint first of all is a star. Bobby suffers and Clint yawns.\" Eastwood later gave a friend the poncho he wore in the three films, where it was hung in a Mexican restaurant in Carmel, California.\nCinematography.\nIn its depiction of violence, Leone used his signature long drawn and close-up style of filming, which he did by mixing extreme face shots and sweeping long shots. By doing so, Leone managed to stage epic sequences punctuated by extreme eyes and face shots, or hands slowly reaching for a holstered gun. Leone also incorporated music to heighten the tension and pressure before and during the film's many gunfights.\nIn filming the pivotal gunfights, Leone largely removes dialogue to focus more on the actions of the characters, which was important during the film's iconic Mexican standoff. This style can also be seen in one of the film's protagonists, Blondie (The Man with No Name), who is described by critics as more defined by his actions than his words. All three characters can be seen as anti-heroes, killing for their personal gain. Leone also employed trick shooting, such as Blondie shooting the hat off a person's head and severing a hangman's noose with a well-placed shot, in many of the film's noted shootouts.\nThemes.\nLike many of his films, director Sergio Leone noted that the film is a satire of the western genre. He has noted the film's theme of emphasis on violence and the deconstruction of Old West romanticism. The emphasis on violence is seen in how the three leads (Blondie, Angel Eyes, and Tuco) are introduced to various acts of violence. With Blondie, it is seen in his attempt to free Tuco which results in a gun battle. Angel Eyes is set up in a scene in which he learns about hidden treasure from Stevens, kills Stevens when he draws on him, then his employer Baker (fulfilling his title as 'The Bad'). Tuco is set up in a scene in which three bounty-hunters try to kill him. In the film's opening scene, three bounty-hunters enter a building in which Tuco is hiding. After the sound of gunfire is heard, Tuco escapes through a window after shooting the three, one of whom survives (fulfilling his title as 'The Ugly'). They are all after gold and will stop at nothing until they get it. The film deconstructs Old West Romanticism by portraying the characters as antiheroes. Even the character considered by the film as 'The Good' can still be considered as not living up to that title in a moral sense. Critic Drew Marton describes it as a \"baroque manipulation\" that criticises the American Ideology of the Western, by replacing the heroic cowboy popularised by John Wayne with morally complex antiheroes.\nNegative themes such as cruelty and greed are also given focus and are traits shared by the three leads in the story. Cruelty is shown in the character of Blondie in how he treats Tuco throughout the film. He is seen to sometimes be friendly with him and in other scenes double-cross him and throw him to the side. It is shown in Angel Eyes through his attitudes in the film and his tendency for committing violent acts throughout the film. For example, when he kills Stevens he also kills his son. It is also seen when he is violently torturing Tuco later in the film. It is shown in Tuco how he shows concern for Blondie when he is heavily dehydrated but in truth, he is only keeping him alive to find the gold. It is also shown in his conversation with his brother which reveals that a life of cruelty is all he knows. Richard Aquila writes \"The violent antiheroes of Italian westerns also fit into a folk tradition in southern Italy that honored mafioso and vigilante who used any means to combat corrupt government or church officials who threatened the peasants of the Mezzogiorno\".\nGreed is shown in the film through its main core plotline of the three characters wanting to find the $200,000 () that Bill Carson has said is buried in a grave in Sad Hill Cemetery. The main plot concerns their greed as there is a series of double crossings and changing allegiances to get the gold. Russ Hunter writes that the film will \"stress the formation of homosocial relationships as being functional only in the pursuit of wealth\".\nMany critics have also noticed the film's anti-war theme. Taking place in the American Civil War, the film takes the viewpoint of people such as civilians, bandits, and most notably soldiers, and presents their daily hardships during the war. This is seen in the film's rugged and rough aesthetic. The film has an air of dirtiness that can be attributed to the Civil War and in turn, it affects the actions of people, showing how the war deep down has affected the lives of many people. A scene in the extended version presents Angel Eyes arriving in an embattled Confederate outpost. Angel Eyes shows compassion towards the agonising soldiers, pointing out that even 'The Bad' is shocked by the horrors of the war.\nAlthough not fighting in the war, the three gunslingers gradually become entangled in the battles that ensue (similar to \"The Great War\", a film that screenwriters Luciano Vincenzoni and Age &amp; Scarpelli had contributed to). An example of this is how Tuco and Blondie blow up a bridge to disperse two sides of the battle. They need to clear a way to the cemetery and succeed in doing so. It is also seen in how Angel Eyes disguises himself as a union sergeant so he can attack and torture Tuco to get the information he needs, intertwining himself in the battle in the process.\nMusic.\nThe score is composed by frequent Leone collaborator Ennio Morricone. \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" broke previous conventions on how the two had previously collaborated. Instead of scoring the film in the post-production stage, they decided to work on the themes together before shooting had started, this was so that the music helped inspire the film instead of the film inspiring the music. Leone even played the music on set and coordinated camera movements to match the music.\nThe vocals of Italian singer Edda Dell'Orso are sung in the composition \"The Ecstasy of Gold\". Guitarist Bruno Battisti D'Amario played in the compositions 'The Sundown' and 'Padre Ramirez'. Trumpet players Michele Lacerenza and Francesco Cataniaare played on 'The Trio'.\nThe only song to have a lyric is 'The Story of a Soldier', the words of which were written by Tommie Connor.\nMorricone uses several unusual instruments, such as gunfire, whistling (by Alessandro Alessandroni), and yodelling.\nThe main theme, resembling the howling of a coyote (which blends in with an actual coyote howl in the first shot after the opening credits), is a two-pitch melody that is a frequent motif, and is used for the three main characters. A different instrument was used for each: flute for Blondie, ocarina for Angel Eyes, and human voices for Tuco.\nThe score complements the film's American Civil War setting, containing the ballad, \"The Story of a Soldier\", which is sung by prisoners as Tuco is being tortured by Angel Eyes. The film's climax, a three-way Mexican standoff, begins with the melody of \"The Ecstasy of Gold\" and is followed by \"The Trio\" (which contains a musical allusion to Morricone's previous work on \"For a Few Dollars More\").\nThe main theme, also titled \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\", was a hit in 1968 with the soundtrack album on the charts for more than a year, reaching No. 4 on the \"Billboard\" pop album chart and No. 10 on the black album chart. The main theme was also a hit for Hugo Montenegro, whose rendition was a No. 2 \"Billboard\" pop single in 1968.\nIn popular culture.\nAmerican heavy metal band Metallica has played \"The Ecstasy of Gold\" as prelude music at their concerts since 1985 (except 1996\u20131998), and in 2007 recorded a version of the instrumental for a compilation tribute to Morricone. Other bands such as the Ramones have featured the song in their albums and live shows. The song has also been sampled within the genre of Hip Hop, most notably by rappers such as Immortal Technique and Jay-Z. \"The Ecstasy of Gold\" has also been used ceremoniously by the Los Angeles Football Club to open home games. XM Satellite Radio's \"The Opie &amp; Anthony Show\" also opens every show with \"The Ecstasy of Gold\".\nPunk rock band Ramones played the main theme as the opening for their live album \"Loco Live\" as well as in concerts until their disbandment in 1996. The British heavy metal band Mot\u00f6rhead played the main theme as the overture music on the 1981 \"No sleep 'til Hammersmith\" tour. The American punk rock band The Vandals' song \"Urban Struggle\" begins with the main theme. British electronica act Bomb the Bass used the main theme as one of several samples on their 1988 single \"Beat Dis\", and used sections of dialogue from Tuco's hanging on \"Throughout The Entire World\", the opening track from their 1991 album \"Unknown Territory\". This dialogue along with some of the \"mule\" dialogue from Fistful of Dollars was also sampled by Big Audio Dynamite on their 1986 single Medicine Show. The main theme was also sampled/re-created by British band New Order for the album version of their 1993 single \"Ruined in a Day\". A song from the band Gorillaz is named \"Clint Eastwood\", and features references to the actor, along with a repeated sample of the theme song; the iconic yell featured in \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\"'s score is heard at the beginning of the music video.\nAmerican new wave group Wall of Voodoo performed a medley of Ennio Morricone's movie themes, including the theme for this movie. The only known recording of it is a live performance on \"The Index Masters\".\nRelease.\nTheatrical.\n\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" was released in Italy on 23 December 1966. In the United States, all three of Leone's Dollars Trilogy films were released in 1967: \"A Fistful of Dollars\" on 18 January; \"For a Few Dollars More\" on 10 May; and \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" on 29 December. The original Italian domestic version was 177 minutes long, but the international version was shown at various lengths. Most prints, specifically those shown in the United States, had a runtime of 161 minutes, 16 minutes shorter than the Italian premiere version, but others, especially British prints, ran as short as 148 minutes.\nHome media.\nOn 28 January 1998, the film was released on DVD by MGM Home Video. Its release from MGM contained 14 minutes of scenes that were cut from the film's North American release. In 2002, the film was restored with the 14 minutes of scenes cut for US release re-inserted into the film. Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach were brought back in to dub their characters' lines more than 35 years after the film's original release. Voice actor Simon Prescott substituted for Lee Van Cleef, who had died in 1989, and other voice actors filled in for since deceased actors. In 2004, MGM released this version in a two-disc special edition DVD.\nDisc 1 contained an audio commentary with writer and critic Richard Schickel. Disc 2 contained two documentaries, \"Leone's West\" and \"The Man Who Lost The Civil War\", followed by the featurette \"Restoring 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly'\"; an animated gallery of missing sequences titled \"The Socorro Sequence: A Reconstruction\"; an extended Tuco torture scene; a featurette called \"Il Maestro\"; an audio featurette named \"Il Maestro, Part 2\"; a French trailer; and a poster gallery.\nThis DVD was generally well received, though some purists complained about the re-mixed stereo soundtrack with many completely new sound effects (notably, the gunshots were replaced), with no option for the original soundtrack. At least one scene that was re-inserted had been cut by Leone before the film's release in Italy but had been shown once at the Italian premiere. According to Richard Schickel, Leone willingly cut the scene for pacing reasons; thus, restoring it was contrary to the director's wishes. MGM re-released the 2004 DVD edition in their \"Sergio Leone Anthology\" box set in 2007. Also included were the two other \"Dollars\" films, and \"Duck, You Sucker!\". On 12 May 2009, the extended version of the film was released on Blu-ray. It contains the same special features as the 2004 special edition DVD, except that it includes an added commentary by film historian Sir Christopher Frayling.\nThe film was re-released on Blu-ray in 2014 using a new 4K remaster, featuring improved picture quality and detail but a change of colour timing, resulting in the film having a more yellow hue than on previous releases. It was re-released on Blu-ray and DVD by Kino Lorber Studio Classics on 15 August 2017, in a new 50th Anniversary release that featured both theatrical and extended cuts, as well as new bonus features, and an attempt to correct the yellow colour timing from the earlier disc. On 27 April 2021, Kino released an Ultra HD Blu-ray version of the theatrical cut, using the same scan from the 2014 remaster, but with extensive colour correction.\nDeleted scenes.\nThe following scenes were originally deleted by distributors from the British and American theatrical versions of the film but were restored after the release of the 2004 Special Edition DVD.\nThe footage below is all featured within supplementary features of the 2004 DVD release\nReception.\nBox office.\nIn Italy, the film grossed $6.3\u00a0million at the time. In the United States and Canada, the film grossed $25.1\u00a0million. It also grossed $ in other international territories, for a total of $ grossed worldwide.\nCritical response.\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" holds an approval rating of 97% based on 77 reviews, with an average rating of 8.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Arguably the greatest of the spaghetti westerns, this epic features a compelling story, memorable performances, breathtaking landscapes, and a haunting score.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 90 out of 100 based on 7 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\nUpon release, \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" received criticism for its depiction of violence. Leone explains that \"the killings in my films are exaggerated because I wanted to make a tongue-in-cheek satire on run-of-the-mill westerns... The west was made by violent, uncomplicated men, and it is this strength and simplicity that I try to recapture in my pictures.\" To this day, Leone's effort to reinvigorate the timeworn Western is widely acknowledged. Furthermore, individual critics attacked the movie for its violence and the fact it was a \"Spaghetti Western\". In a negative review in \"The New York Times\", a critic Renata Adler said that the film \"must be the most expensive, pious and repellent movie in the history of its peculiar genre.\" Charles Champlin of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote that the \"temptation is hereby proved irresistible to call \"The Good, The Bad and the Ugly\", now playing citywide, \"The Bad, The Dull, and the Interminable\", only because it is.\" Roger Ebert, who later included the film in his list of Great Movies, retrospectively noted that in his original review he had \"described a four-star movie, but only gave it three stars, perhaps because it was a 'Spaghetti Western' and so could not be art.\" He would retrospectively give the movie a full 4 star rating. \nLegacy.\nRe-evaluation.\nDespite the initial negative reception by some critics, the film has since accumulated very positive feedback. It is listed in \"Time\"'s \"100 Greatest Movies of the Last Century\" as selected by critics Richard Corliss and Richard Schickel. \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" has been described as European cinema's best Western, and Quentin Tarantino has called it \"the best-directed film of all time\" and \"the greatest achievement in the history of cinema\". This was reflected in his votes for the 2002 and 2012 \"Sight &amp; Sound\" magazine polls, in which he voted for \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" as his choice for the best film ever made. Its main music theme from the soundtrack is regarded by Classic FM as one of the most iconic themes of all time. \"Variety\" magazine ranked the film number 49 on their list of the 50 greatest movies. In 2002, Film4 held a poll of the 100 Greatest Movies, on which \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" was voted in at number 46. \"Premiere\" magazine included the film on their \"100 Most Daring Movies Ever Made\" list. Mr. Showbiz ranked the film #81 on its \"100 Best Movies of All Time\" list.\n\"Empire\" magazine added \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" to their Masterpiece collection in the September 2007 issue, and their poll of \"The 500 Greatest Movies\", \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" was voted in at number 25. In 2014, \"The Good the Bad and the Ugly\" was ranked the 47th greatest film ever made on \"Empire\"'s list of \"The 301 Greatest Movies Of All Time\" as voted by the magazine's readers. It was also placed on a similar list of 1000 movies by \"The New York Times\". In 2014, \"Time Out\" polled several film critics, directors, actors and stunt actors to list their top action films. \"The Good, The Bad and the Ugly\" placed 52nd on their list. An article on the BBC website considers the 'lasting legacy of the film, and describes the trio scene as \"one of the most riveting and acclaimed feature films sequences of all time\".\nIn popular culture.\nThe film's title has entered the English language as an idiomatic expression. Typically used when describing something thoroughly, the respective phrases refer to upsides, downsides, and the parts that could, or should have been done better, but were not.\nQuentin Tarantino paid homage to the film's climactic stand-off scene in his 1992 film \"Reservoir Dogs\".\nThe film was novelised in 1967 by Joe Millard as part of the \"Dollars Western\" series based on the \"Man with No Name\". The South Korean western movie \"The Good, the Bad, the Weird\" (2008) is inspired by the film, with much of its plot and character elements borrowed from Leone's film. In his introduction to the 2003 revised edition of his novel \"\", Stephen King said the film was a primary influence for the \"Dark Tower\" series, with Eastwood's character inspiring the creation of King's protagonist, Roland Deschain.\nIn 1975, Willie Col\u00f3n with Yomo Toro and Hector Lavoe, released an album titled \"The Good, the Bad, the Ugly\". The album cover featured the three in cowboy attire.\nImpact on Western genre.\nWhile the \"Dollars Trilogy\" was not the beginning of the so-called Spaghetti Western cycle in Italy, many in the US saw it as the beginning of an Italian invasion of the most recognisably American film genre. Christopher Frayling argues that, on the whole, Americans had become \"bored with an exhausted Hollywood genre\". He notes that Pauline Kael, for example, had appreciated how non-American films of the time \"could exploit the conventions of the Western genre, while debunking its morality\". Along with Peter Bondanella and others, Frayling argues that such revisionism was the key to Leone's success and, to some degree, to that of the Spaghetti Western genre as a whole. \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\", like the later \"Once Upon A Time In The West\", belongs to multiple Western sub-genres: Epic Western, Outlaw (Gunfighter) Film, Revisionist Western and Spaghetti Western.\n\"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\" has been called the definitive Spaghetti Western \u2013 colloquially, these are Westerns produced and directed by Italians, often in collaboration with other European countries, especially Spain and West Germany. The name 'Spaghetti Western' originally was a pejorative term, given by foreign critics to these films because they thought they were inferior to American westerns. Most of the films were made with low budgets, but several still managed to be innovative and artistic, although at the time they did not get much recognition, even in Europe. The genre is unmistakably a Catholic genre, with a visual style strongly influenced by the Catholic iconography of, for instance, the crucifixion or the last supper. The outdoor scenes of many Spaghetti Westerns, especially those with a relatively higher budget, were shot in Spain, in particular the Tabernas desert of Almer\u00eda and Colmenar Viejo and Hoyo de Manzanares. In Italy, the region of Lazio was a favourite location.\nThe genre expanded and became an international sensation with the success of Sergio Leone's \"A Fistful of Dollars\", an adaptation of Akira Kurosawa's samurai film \"Yojimbo\". But a handful of westerns were made in Italy before Leone redefined the genre, and the Italians were not the first to make westerns in Europe in the sixties. But it was Leone who defined the look and attitude of the genre with his first western and the two that soon were to follow: \"For a Few Dollars More\" and \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\". Together these films are called the Dollars Trilogy. Leone's portrayal of the west, in the latter, was not concerned with ideas of the frontier or good vs. evil but rather interested in how the world is unmistakably more complicated than that, and how the western world is one of kill or be killed. These films featured knifings, beatings, shootouts, or other violent action every five to ten minutes. \"The issue of morality belongs to the American western,\" explains Italian director Ferdinando Baldi. \"The violence in our movies is more gratuitous than in American films. There was very little morality because often the protagonist was a bad guy.\" Eastwood's character is a violent and ruthless killer who murders opponents for fun and profit. Behind his cold and stony stare is a cynical mind powered by a dubious morality. Unlike earlier cowboy heroes, Eastwood's character constantly smokes a small cigar and hardly ever shaves. He wears a flat-topped hat and Mexican poncho instead of more traditional western costuming. He never introduces himself when he meets anyone, and nobody ever asks his name. Furthermore, Spaghetti Westerns redefined the western genre to fit the everchanging times of the 1960s and '70s. Rather than portraying the traditional mythic West as an exotic and beautiful land of opportunity, hope, and redemption, they depicted a desolate and forsaken West. In these violent and troubled times, Spaghetti Westerns, with their antiheroes, ambiguous morals, brutality, and anti-Establishment themes, resonated with audiences. The film's gratuitous violence, surrealistic style, gloomy look, and eerie sound captured the era's melancholy. It is this new approach to the genre that defined the revisionist western of the late '70s and early '80s; a movement started by this moral ambiguity of the Spaghetti Westerns, as well as a westerns placement in the context of historical events; both attributes defined and set by \"The Good, the Bad, and The Ugly\".\nThese films have a recognisable style. With grandiose wide shots and close-ups that peered into the eyes and souls of the characters, \"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly\", had the defining cinematographic techniques of the Spaghetti Western. This was Leone's signature technique, using long drawn shots interspersed with extreme close-ups that build tension, as well as develop characters. However, Leone's movies were not just influenced by style. As Quentin Tarantino notes:\n There was also realism to them: those shitty Mexican towns, the little shacks\u00a0\u2014 a bit bigger to accommodate the camera\u00a0\u2014 all the plates they put the beans on, the big wooden spoons. The films were so realistic, which had always seemed to be missing in the westerns of the 1930s, '40s, and '50s, in the brutality and the different shades of grey and black. Leone found an even darker black and off-white. There is realism in Leone's presentation of the Civil War in \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" that was missing from all the Civil War movies that happened before him. Leone's film, and the genre that he defined within it, shows a west that is more violent, less talky, more complex, more theatrical, and just overall more iconic through the use of music, appearing operatic as the music is an illustrative ingredient of the narrative.\nWith a greater sense of operatic violence than their American cousins, the cycle of spaghetti westerns lasted just a few years, but it has been said to have rewritten the genre.\nFilm tourism.\nFans of the film have reconstructed the location of the Sad Hill Cemetery in Santo Domingo de Silos, in Spain. The reconstruction was recorded in the documentary \"Sad Hill Unearthed\" (2017) by Guillermo de Oliveira.\nIn 2024, the Sabinares del Arlanza Natural Park announced a plan to rebuild the Betterville prisoner camp at its filmed location about 6\u00a0km from Sad Hill.\nCancelled sequel.\n\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" does not have an official sequel. However, screenwriter Luciano Vincenzoni stated on numerous occasions that he had written a treatment for a sequel, tentatively titled \"Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo n. 2\" \"(The Good, the Bad and the Ugly 2)\". According to Vincenzoni and Eli Wallach, the film would have been set 20 years after the original and would have followed Tuco pursuing Blondie's grandson for the gold. The project was ultimately vetoed by Leone, as he did not want the original film's title or characters to be reused, nor did he want to be involved in another Western film.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was followed by the Color Computer 2 in 1983, then the Color Computer 3 in 1986. All three models maintain a high level of software and hardware compatibility, with few programs written for an older model being unable to run on the newer ones. The Color Computer 3 was discontinued in 1991.\nAll Color Computer models shipped with Color BASIC, an implementation of Microsoft BASIC, in ROM. Variants of the OS-9 multitasking operating system were available from third parties.\nHistory.\nTandy Corporation announced the TRS-80 Color Computer in July 1980 as a low-cost home computer. The Color Computer is a completely different design than the Zilog Z80-based TRS-80 models. \"BYTE\" wrote, \"The only similarity between [the two computers] is the name\".\nThe TRS-80 Color Computer derives from an \"experimental videotext project by the Kentucky Cooperative Extension Service and the University of Kentucky College of Agriculture\" in 1977. Motorola Semiconductor of Austin, Texas, won the contract for the user terminals and Tandy's Computer Division joined later to manufacture the terminals. The initial goal of this project, called \"Green Thumb\", was to create a low cost videotex terminal for farmers, ranchers, and others in the agricultural industry. This terminal would connect to a phone line and an ordinary color television and allow the user access to near-real-time information useful to their day-to-day operations on the farm.\nMotorola's MC6847 Video Display Generator (VDG) chip was released about the time the joint venture started. The 1978 prototype \"Green Thumb\" terminal used the MC6847 and the Motorola 6809 microprocessor. However, the prototype contained too many chips to be commercially viable. Motorola responded by integrating the functions of many smaller chips into one chip: the MC6883 Synchronous Address Multiplexer (SAM). The SAM, VDG, and 6809 were used as the core of the AgVision terminal. It was also sold through Radio Shack stores as the VideoTex terminal around 1980.\nThe VideoTex terminal provided the foundation for a general-purpose home computer. The internal modem was removed, and I/O ports for cassette storage, serial I/O, and joysticks were provided. An expansion connector was added to the right side of the case for future enhancements and ROM cartridges (\"Program Paks\"). A sticker indicating the amount of installed memory in the machine covers the hole where the modem's LED \"DATA\" indicator had been. On July 31, 1980, Tandy announced the TRS-80 Color Computer, which shares the same case, keyboard, and layout as the AgVision/VideoTex terminals.\nTandy viewed businesses as its primary market for computers. Although the company's Ed Juge said in 1981 that the Color Computer was \"our entry into the home-computer market\", he described it as \"for serious professionals\", stating that a word processor and spreadsheet would soon be available. The initial model (catalog number 26-3001) shipped with 4\u00a0KB of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and 8 KB Microsoft BASIC in ROM. Its price was US$. Within a few months, Radio Shack stores across the US and Canada began selling the new computer.\nColor Computer 1 (1980\u20131983).\nThe original version of the Color Computer sports a large silver-gray case with a calculator-like chiclet keyboard and was available with memory sizes of 4K (26-3001), 16K (26-3002), or 32K (26-3003). Versions with at least 16K of memory installed shipped with standard Microsoft Color Basic or (optionally) Extended Color BASIC. The only available connection to a display device is to a TV.\nEarly versions of the CoCo 1 have a black keyboard surround, the TRS-80 nameplate above the keyboard to the left side, and a RAM badge (\"button\") affixed on the top and right side of the case. Later versions removed the black keyboard surround and RAM button, and moved the TRS-80 nameplate to the mid-line of the case.\nThe computer is based on a single printed-circuit board with all semiconductors manufactured by Motorola including the MC6809E CPU, MC6847 VDG, MC6883 SAM, and RAM, which consists of 2104 (4Kx1) chips (4K models) or 4116 (16Kx1) chips (16K models). The early CoCos only have eight RAM sockets, so upgrading to 32K requires piggybacking two sets of 4116 chips and adding a few jumper wires. A later motherboard revision removed the 4K RAM option and were upgraded to 32K with \"half-bad\" 4164 DRAMs. These boards have jumpers marked HIGH/LOW to determine which half of the memory chip was good. As memory production yields improved and costs went down, many (perhaps most) 32K CoCo 1s shipped with perfectly good 4164 memory chips. Utilities and programs began to take advantage of the hidden 32K.\nUsers opening the case risked invalidating the warranty. Radio Shack could upgrade all versions that shipped with standard Color BASIC to Extended Color BASIC, developed by Microsoft, for $99. \"BYTE\" wrote in 1981 that through Extended Color BASIC, Radio Shack \"has released the first \"truly\" easy-to-use and inexpensive system that generates full-color graphics\". Eventually the 32K memory option was dropped entirely and only 16K or 64K versions were offered.\nIn late 1982, a version of the Color Computer with a white case, called the TDP System 100, was distributed by RCA and sold through non-Tandy stores. Except for the nameplate and case, it is identical to the Color Computer.\nLater, both the CoCo and the TDP System 100 shipped with a white case with ventilation slots running the length of the case rather than only the sides. This ventilation scheme carried over to the CoCo 2. Some late versions of the CoCo have a modified keyboard, often referred to as the \"melted\" keyboard, with bigger keycaps.\nPeripherals included tape cassette storage, serial printers, a 5.25-inch floppy disk drive, a pen and graphics tablet called the X-Pad, speech and sound generators, and joysticks.\nColor Computer 2 (1983\u20131986).\nDuring the initial CoCo 1 production run, much of the discrete support circuitry had been re-engineered into a handful of custom integrated circuits, leaving much of the circuit board area of the CoCo 1 as empty space. To cut production costs, the case was shortened by about 25% and a new, smaller power supply and motherboard were designed. The \"melted\" keyboard from the white CoCo 1 and the TDP-100 style ventilation slots were carried over. Aside from the new look and the deletion of the 12 volt power supply to the expansion connector, the computer was compatible with the previous generation. The removal of the 12V power supply crippled some peripherals such as the original floppy disk controller, which then needed to be upgraded, installed in a Multi-Pak interface, or supplied with external power.\nThe CoCo 2 was sold in 16K and 64K models. 16K models use 16Kx1 DRAMs, but the chips are not the common 4116; they were instead 4517s (Radio Shack P/N 8040517), which use only +5V power rather than the triple voltages used by the 4116. 64K models use standard 4164 chips and have a control register at $FFDE/$FFDF to switch between the second 32K of RAM and the OS ROMs. With the ROMs banked out, the entire 64K of system RAM can be accessed.\nUpgraded BASIC ROMs add minor features and fix some bugs. A redesigned 5-volt disk controller was introduced with its own new Disk BASIC ROM (v1.1). It adds a new command, codice_1, to auto-boot software from disk (this requires a disk with a special boot sector). This allows the use of software on copy protected disks or third-party operating systems, chiefly OS-9.\nProduction was partially moved to Korea, with production in the US and Korea happening in parallel using the same part numbers.\nAround March 1984, Radio Shack began advertising a 64K version of the CoCo 2 which also included an 'enhanced' full-travel, typewriter-style keyboard in the production run, replacing the previous \"melted\" keyboard.\nThe final significant change in the life of the CoCo 2 (models 26-3134B, 26-3136B, and 26-3127B; 16K standard, 16K extended, and 64K extended respectively) was to use the enhanced VDG, the MC6847T1, allowing lowercase characters and changing the text screen border color. These features were not enabled in BASIC. Midway during the production run of these models, the nameplate was changed from \"Radio Shack TRS-80 Color Computer 2\" to \"Tandy Color Computer 2\". The red, green, and blue shapes were replaced with red, green, and blue parallelograms.\n\"Creative Computing\" wrote in December 1984 that the Color Computer was the best educational computer under $1000. The magazine said that it had fewer but better-quality educational software titles than the Commodore 64, and that Radio Shack was dedicated to the educational market while Commodore was not.\nColor Computer 3 (1986\u20131991).\nBy 1985, Color Computer users worried that the company would abandon their computer in favor of the Tandy 1000. Tandy executive Ed Juge stated that year that \"No home computer on the market today has the potential horsepower of the Color Computer ... we believe [it] also has a good future\".\nOn July 30, 1986, Tandy announced the Color Computer 3 at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. It came with 128\nKB of RAM, which could be upgraded to 512 KB. The panel behind the keyboard and cartridge door plastic were changed from black to grey. The keyboard layout was revised, putting the arrow keys in a diamond configuration and adding , , , and keys. It sold in Radio Shack stores and Tandy Computer Centers for $219.95.\nThe CoCo 3 is compatible with most older software and CoCo 2 peripherals. The 6809 in the CoCo 1 and 2 runs at 0.895\u00a0MHz. The CoCo 3 runs at that frequency by default, but is software controllable to run at twice that rate; OS-9 takes advantage of that capability. Taking the place of the graphics and memory hardware in the CoCo 1 and 2 is an application-specific integrated circuit called the GIME (Graphics Interrupt Memory Enhancement) chip. The GIME also provides:\nOmitted from the GIME are the seldom-used SAM-created Semigraphics 8, 12, and 24 modes. A rumored 256-color mode (detailed in the original Tandy spec for the GIME) has never been found.\nPrevious versions of the CoCo ROM were licensed from Microsoft, but Tandy could not convince them to provide further BASIC updates. Instead, Microware provided extensions to Extended Color BASIC to support the new display modes. To not violate the spirit of the licensing agreement between Microsoft and Tandy, Microsoft's unmodified BASIC is loaded in the CoCo 3's ROM. Upon startup, the ROM is copied to RAM and patched by Microware's code. The patched code has several bugs, and support for many of the new hardware features is incomplete.\nMicroware also provided a version of the OS-9 Level 2 operating system shortly after launch. OS-9 uses memory-mapping (so each process has its own memory space up to 64K), windowed display, and a more extensive development environment that includes a copy of BASIC09. C and Pascal compilers were available. Members of the CoCo OS-9 community enhanced OS-9 Level 2 for the CoCo 3 at Tandy's request, but Tandy stopped production of the CoCo 3 before the upgrade was officially released. Most of the improvements made it into NitrOS-9, a major rewrite of OS-9/6809 Level 2 for the CoCo 3 to take advantage of the features and speed of the Hitachi 6309 (if available).\nHardware.\nInternally the CoCo 1 and CoCo 2 models are functionally identical. The core of the system is virtually identical to the reference design included in the Motorola MC6883 data sheet and consists of five LSI chips:\nSAM.\nThe SAM is a multifunction device that performs the following functions:\nThe SAM was designed to replace numerous small LS/TTL chips into one integrated package. Its main purpose is to control the DRAM but, as outlined above, it integrates several other functions as well. It is connected to a crystal at 4 times the television colorburst frequency (14.31818\u00a0MHz for NTSC countries). This is divided by 4 internally and is fed to the VDG for its own internal timing (3.579545\u00a0MHz for NTSC). The SAM also divides the master clock by 16 (or 8 in certain cases) for the two phase MPU clock; in NTSC this is 0.89\u00a0MHz (or 1.8\u00a0MHz if divided by 8).\nSwitching the SAM into 1.8\u00a0MHz operation gives the CPU the time ordinarily used by the VDG and refresh. As such, the display shows garbage; this mode was seldom used. However, an unusual mode available by the SAM is called the Address Dependent mode, where ROM reads (since they do not use the DRAM) occur at 1.8\u00a0MHz but regular RAM access occurs at 0.89\u00a0MHz. In effect, since the BASIC interpreter runs from ROM, putting the machine in this mode would nearly double the performance of a BASIC program while maintaining video display and DRAM refresh. Of course, this would throw off the software timing loops and I/O operations would be affected. Despite this, however, the \"high speed POKE\" was used by many CoCo BASIC programs even though it overclocked the hardware in the CoCo, which was only rated for 1\u00a0MHz operation.\nThe SAM has no connection to the MPU data bus. As such, it is programmed in a curious manner; its 16-bit configuration register is spread across 32 memory addresses (FFC0-FFDF). Writing even bytes sets that register bit to 0, while writing odd bytes sets it to 1. The value (D7-D0) that is written is ignored.\nDue to limitations in 40-pin packaging, the SAM contains a duplicate of the VDG's internal 12-bit address counter. Normally this counter's settings are set to duplicate the VDG's display mode. However, this is not required and results in the creation of some new display modes not possible when the VDG is used in a system alone. Instead of the VDG requesting data from RAM by itself, the VDG is \"fed\" data by the SAM's internal copy of the VDG address counter. This process is called \"Interleaved Direct Memory Access\" (IDMA) by Motorola and ensures that the processor and VDG always have full access to this shared memory resource with no wait states or contention.\nThere are two versions of the SAM. The early one is labeled MC6883 and/or SN74LS783; the later version is labeled SN74LS785. There are some minor timing differences, but the major difference is the support of an 8-bit refresh counter in the 785 version. This allowed for use of inexpensive 16K by 4-bit and certain 64K by 1-bit DRAMs. Some third-party bank-switching memory upgrades that used 256K DRAMs needed this 8-bit refresh counter to work.\nVDG.\nThe Motorola 6847 is a display generator capable of displaying text and graphics contained within a roughly square display matrix 256 pixels wide by 192 lines high. It can display 9 colors: black, green, yellow, blue, red, white, cyan, magenta, and orange.\nAlphanumeric/Semigraphics display.\nIn alphanumeric mode, each character is a 5 dot wide by 7 dot high character in a box 8 dots wide and 12 lines high. This display mode occupies 512 bytes of memory from $400-$5FF and is a 32 character wide screen with 16 lines. The ROM character generator only holds 64 characters, so no lowercase characters are provided. \"Lowercase\" characters are rendered as uppercase with inverted color. On most CoCo generations it is green on very dark green.\nSemigraphics is a mode where alphanumerics and low resolution graphics can be mixed together. The 8th bit of a character determines if it is alphanumeric or treated as a 2 \u00d7 2 pixel grid. When the 8th bit is set, the next three bits determine the color and last 4 bits specify which quadrants of the character box are either the selected color or black. This allows a 64 \u00d7 32 graphics mode with 9 colors, the only mode where it is possible to display all 9 colors simultaneously.\nThere are two color sets. The default has black characters on a green background. The alternate has black characters on an orange background. The color set selection does not affect semigraphics characters. The border is always black.\nThe 6847 is capable of a Semigraphics 6 display mode, where two bits select a color and 6 bits determine which 1/6 of the character box is lit. Only 4 colors are possible, but the colorset bit of the VDG selects two groups of 4 colors. Only two colors are available in graphics blocks when using Semigraphics 6 on the CoCo.\nThe default alphanumeric display for the CoCo is Semigraphics 4.\nAdditional Semigraphics modes.\nBy setting the SAM such that it believes it is displaying a full graphics mode, but leaving the VDG in Alphanumeric/Semigraphics 4 mode, it is possible to subdivide the character box into smaller pieces. This creates the \"virtual\" modes Semigraphics 8, 12, and 24. In these modes it was possible to mix bits and pieces of different text characters as well as Semigraphics 4 characters. These modes were an interesting curiosity but not widely used, as the Semigraphics 24-screen consumed 6144 bytes of memory. These modes were not implemented on the CoCo 3.\nA programmer's reference manual for the CoCo states that due to a fire at Tandy's research lab, the papers relating to the semigraphics modes were shuffled, and so some of the semigraphics modes were never documented. CoCo enthusiasts created experimental programs to try to reverse engineer the modes, and were able to reconstruct the missing documentation.\nBitmap modes.\nBitmap display modes are divided into two categories: \"resolution\" and \"color\".\nIn resolution modes, each pixel is addressable as either on or off. There are two color sets available: black dots on a green background with a green border, and white dots on a black background with a white border.\nIn color modes, each pixel uses two bits to select one of four colors, with the overall colors determined by the colorset: \nResolution graphics store 8 pixels per byte and are available in 128\u00d764, 128\u00d796, 128\u00d7192, and 256\u00d7192 modes. Color graphics have 4 pixels per byte and are available in 64\u00d764, 128\u00d764, 128\u00d796, and 128\u00d7192. The maximum size of a bitmap screen is 6144.\nArtifact colors.\nThe 256\u00d7192 two color graphics mode can display four colors due to a quirk in the NTSC television system. It is similar to the Apple II's DHGR graphics but slightly lower resolution and with four rather than six colors. These are called composite artifact colors. Two 6k pages can be used and the location of them differs depending on whether the disk controller is in use or not. If it is plugged into the expansion port, the graphics page begins at $E00 and at $600 if not (cassette software that utilizes the hi res mode would require the disk controller to be removed to ensure the graphics page is where the software expects it to be in).\nIn the first color set, where green and black dots are available, alternating columns of green and black appear as a muddy green color. With the white and black color set, the result is either orange or blue. Reversing the order of the alternating dots gives the opposite color. In effect, this mode is 128\u00d7192 with four colors: black, orange, blue, and white. On PAL televisions, instead of solid orange and blue, artifacts appear as vertical stripes of green and peach with soft edges and a width of almost four pixels. On a CoCo 3 with an analog RGB monitor, the black and white dot patterns do not artifact.\nThe bit patterns that represent orange and blue can be different each time the system is powered up. Most Color Computer games start with a title screen and ask the user to press the reset button until the colors are correct. This is fixed on the Color Computer 3 and the other color set can be chosen by holding during reset.\nLowercase and the 6847T1.\nThe 6847 is capable of using an external character generator. Several third-party add-on boards allow the CoCo to display real lowercase characters.\nLate in the CoCo 2 production run, the enhanced 6847T1 VDG was used. It includes a lowercase character generator and the ability to display a green/orange or black border on the text screen. The lowercase capability is disabled by default on these CoCo 2s, and is not mentioned in the manual.\nSound.\nThere is a four position, software selectable, switch inside the case to determine which audio source is routed to the TV modulator.\nAn additional 1-bit sound output is always active.\nRadio Shack sold two audio devices to attach to the expansion port. The Speech/Sound Pak includes an AY-3-8913 programmable sound generator and a SPO256-AL2 text to speech digital narrator. The Orchestra-90 Pak includes two 8-bit digital-to-analog converters.\nDisk interface.\nThe CoCo uses an external floppy disk controller that plugs into the side expansion port. The controller uses a WD 1791 FDC and a ROM-based disk operating system which is immediately available at power-on and does not require an OS disk (the CoCo 2-3 controller also supports booting alternative RAM-resident DOSes in place of the ROM one by typing the DOS command in BASIC). The CoCo 1 uses Shugart SA-400 full-height 5.25\" drives which are 35 track single-sided units and formatted disks to 160k. They are similar to the TRS-80 Model I disk drives except for the custom modification of a power switch in the front faceplate. The CoCo 2-3 replaced these with 40 track half-height drives, two per unit (the existing 35 track 160k format was retained for compatibility purposes with the CoCo 1). The stock drives can be replaced by any Shugart-standard 34 pin interface units for additional storage space although the ROM DOS only supports default 160k format. The CoCo 1 controller has an older version of the WD 1791 FDC chip manufactured in enhancement load NMOS that needs three voltages to operate: 12V, 5V, and -5V. The CoCo 2 switched to a newer FDC that used a single 5V power line, and the 12V line was removed from the expansion port. Consequently the CoCo 1 controller will not work on the CoCo 2-3 nor will the latter's controller work on the CoCo 1.\nThe ROM DOS functions as part of BASIC and all disk commands are implemented as BASIC statements. BASIC programs can be loaded from disk by the LOAD command and LOADM for machine language programs.\nPIAs.\nThere are two Peripheral Interface Adapter chips in all CoCo models. The PIAs are dedicated to I/O operations such as driving the internal 6-bit digital-to-analog converter, controlling the relay for the cassette motor, reading the keyboard, controlling the VDG mode pins, and accessing the RS-232 serial I/O port.\nThe earliest CoCo models have two standard 6821 chips. Later, after changes in the keyboard design, the 6822 IIA (Industrial Interface Adapter) was used instead. The 6822 was eventually discontinued by Motorola, but was produced for Tandy as an application-specific integrated circuit with the part number SC67331P.\nCoCo 3 hardware changes.\nIn the CoCo 3, a new VLSI ASIC called (officially) the Advanced Color Video Chip (ACVC) or (unofficially) the Graphics Interrupt Memory Enhancer (GIME), integrated the functions of the SAM and VDG while enhancing the capabilities of both. The CoCo 3 supports 40- and 80-column text and the ability to run at 1.8\u00a0MHz without loss of video. The processor was changed to the 68B09E and the PIA was changed to the 68B21, which are 2\u00a0MHz parts.\nDiscontinuation.\nOn October 26, 1990, Tandy announced that the CoCo 3 would be dropped from its computer line.\nWayne Green wrote in \"80 Micro\" in December 1982 that Tandy had \"virtually abandoned\" the Color Computer. As with its other computers, Tandy attempted to monopolize hardware and software sales, but, he wrote, the Color Computer was incompatible with other Tandy software and what was available was of poor quality. \"I'm sure there are at least fifty software firms out there that would love to work with the Shack\", Green said, but \"it seems that the Shack people are at war with their supporters and potential suppliers\". Many CoCo owners agree that Tandy did not take the computer seriously.\nSuccessors.\nA few companies attempted to carry the CoCo torch, but the lack of decent backwards compatibility with the CoCo 3 failed to entice much of the community. Some of these systems run OS9/68k, which is similar to OS-9.\nFrank Hogg Labs introduced the Tomcat TC-9 in June 1990, which is somewhat compatible with the CoCo 3, but is only able to run OS-9 software. A later version called the TC-70 has strong compatibility with the MM/1, and also runs OS-9/68K.\nMulti-Media One was introduced in July 1990, runs OS-9/68K on a 15\u00a0MHz Signetics 68070 processor with 3 MB RAM, and a 640\u00d7208 graphics resolution as well as supporting a 640\u00d7416 interlaced mode. It includes a SCSI interface, stereo A/D and D/A conversion, an optional MIDI interface, and an optional board to upgrade the CPU to a Motorola 68340. The AT306 (also known as the MM/1B) is a successor to the MM/1 that contains a Motorola 68306 CPU, OS-9/68K 3.0, and allows ISA bus cards. It was created by Kevin Pease and Carl Kreider, and sold by Carl's company, Kreider Electronics.\nPeripheral Technology produced a 16\u00a0MHz Motorola 68000 system called a PTK68K-4. Delmar sold systems based on the PT68K-4 and called the Delmar System IV. The PT68K-4 has the footprint of an IBM PC and seven 8-bit ISA slots. Video is provided by a standard video card and monitor, but for high-resolution graphics the software only supports certain video cards.\nGary Becker produced the CoCo3FPGA for Terasic DE FPGA boards. It contains a 6809 CPU core which can run at 25\u00a0MHz. It adds 256-color graphics modes, including a 640x450 mode.\nRoger Taylor developed a CoCo 3 clone, Matchbox Coco, based on the DE0-Nano FPGA board. Renamed to RealCoCo, it has been ported to other FPGA hardware.\nClones and cousins.\nThe Dragon 32 and 64 are British cousins of the CoCo based on a reference design from Motorola that was produced as an example of the capabilities of the MC6809E CPU when coupled with the MC6847 Video Display Generator and the MC6883 Synchronous Address Multiplexer. The BIOS for the Dragon 32 was written based on specifications and API drawn up by Microsoft and, to a certain extent, PA Consulting of Cambridge. The Dragon was a much improved unit with video output in addition to the TV output of the CoCo and CoCo 2. It also featured a Centronics parallel port (not present on any CoCo), an integrated 6551A serial UART (on the Dragon 64), and a higher-quality keyboard. In 1983, a version of the Dragon was licensed for manufacture for the North American market by Tano Corporation of New Orleans, Louisiana. Tano started production at their facility in September 1983 and were running at capacity one month later. Sales did not meet expectations and Tano stopped production and support after a year.\nIn Brazil, there were several CoCo clones, including the Prol\u00f3gica CP 400 Color and CP 400 Color II, the Varix VC 50, the LZ Color 64, the Dynacom MX-1600, the Codimex CD-6809, and the vaporware Microdigital TKS800.\nIn Mexico, the Micro-SEP, a CoCo 2 clone with 64 KB of memory, was introduced by the Secretary of Education. The Micro-SEP was intended to be distributed nationally to all the public schools teaching the 7th to 9th grades. They were presented as a design of the Center of Advanced Research and Studies of Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional. Like the Dragon, these computers also included video output. Whether these computers were \"designed\" by this institute, or were licensed from the original design, is unclear.\nA Taiwan-based company, Sampo, also made a CoCo clone, the Sampo Color Computer. The Sampo was supposedly available in Taiwan, Korea, and possibly other Asian countries. It is believed that Tandy blocked sales in the US with legal action due to copyright infringements on the ROM code.\nThe TRS-80 MC-10, or Micro Color Computer, was sold in Radio Shack stores as an entry-level computer at a lower cost than the CoCo. Released in 1983, it was similar in appearance to the Timex Sinclair. Like the CoCo, it uses the MC6847 VDG and Microsoft BASIC, but with the MC6803 instead of the 6809.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was senior adviser to the president of the United Nations Foundation, chair of the Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies, and was past president of the American Institute of Biological Sciences, past chairman of the United States Man and Biosphere Program, and past president of the Society for Conservation Biology.\nLovejoy developed the debt-for-nature swaps, in which environmental groups purchase shaky foreign debt on the secondary market at the market rate, which is considerably discounted, and then convert this debt at its face value into the local currency to purchase biologically sensitive tracts of land in the debtor nation for purposes of environmental protection.\nCritics of the 'debt-for-nature' schemes, such as National Center for Public Policy Research, which distributes a wide variety of materials consistently justifying corporate freedom and environmental deregulation, aver that plans deprive developing nations of the extractable raw resources that are currently essential to further economic development. Economic stagnation and local resentment of \"Yankee imperialism\" can result, they warn. In reality, no debt-for-nature swap occurs without the approval of the country in question.\nLovejoy also supported the Forests Now Declaration, which calls for new market-based mechanisms to protect tropical forests.\nLovejoy played a central role in the establishment of conservation biology, by initiating the idea and planning with B. A. Wilcox in June 1978 for \"The First International Conference on Research in Conservation Biology\", that was held in La Jolla, in September 1978. The proceedings, introduced conservation biology to the scientific community.\nLovejoy founded the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP) near Manaus, Brazil, in 1979 to understand the effects of the fragmentation on tropical rainforests on ecosystems and wildlife.\nLovejoy served on many scientific and conservation boards and advisory groups, and was the author of numerous articles and books. He is often misattributed as the founder of the PBS television series \"NATURE\", for which he served as an advisor in the early days. He served in an official capacity in the Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Clinton administrations.\nLovejoy predicted in 1980 (see quote below), that 10\u201320 percent of all species on earth would have gone extinct by the year 2020.\nAwards and recognitions.\nIn 1996, Lovejoy was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\nLovejoy was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1999.\nIn 2001, Lovejoy was the recipient of the University of Southern California's Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement. Lovejoy has been granted the 2008 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in the Ecology and Conservation Biology category (\"ex aequo\" with William F. Laurance).\nIn 2001, Lovejoy received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member Peter H. Raven.\nIn 2004, a new wasp species that acts as a parasite on butterfly larvae was discovered on the Pacific slope of the Talamanca mountain range in Costa Rica by Ronald Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, a specialist in bees, wasps and ants at the National Biodiversity Institute (INBio). INBio named the species \"Polycyrtus lovejoyi\" in honor of Lovejoy for his contributions in the world of biodiversity and support for INBio.\nOn October 31, 2012, Lovejoy was awarded the Blue Planet Prize for being \"the first scientist to academically clarify how humans are causing habitat fragmentation and pushing biological diversity towards crisis.\"\nLovejoy served continuously on the board of directors, from 2000, of the Amazon Conservation Team, which works in partnership with indigenous people of tropical South America in conserving the biodiversity of the Amazon rainforest, as well as the culture and land of its indigenous people. He served on the board of directors from 2009 for the Amazon Conservation Association, whose mission is to conserve the biological diversity of the Amazon. He was also an emeritus member of the board of directors for Population Action International and served on the Scientific Board of SavingSpecies (elevated to SavingNature in 2019), a conservation organization featured in a \"Nature\" magazine article about Thomas Lovejoy's scientific accomplishments.\nIn 2016, he was selected as a U.S. Science Envoy by the United States State Department.\nIn 2018, Lovejoy co-founded the Amazon Biodiversity Center to support the work of the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project. He was elected Fellow of Ecological Society of America in 2019.\nIn 2021, he was elected member of the U. S. National Academy of Sciences.\nHe died from pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor on December 25, 2021, in McLean, Virginia, at the age of 80.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The island is a limestone massif long and wide, with steep cliffs except at its ends. Its highest point, Monte Cannone, is above sea level. A cove and beach can be found at each end of the island, Spalmatore di Fuori at the northeast, and Spalmatore di Terra at the southwest. Currently, the island is inhabited by only a handful of families, and has a small cemetery and summer restaurant. The water around the island is a popular spot for scuba diving.\nThe nearest sizable town is Olbia, and the small fishing village of Porto San Paolo is directly across a small strait. The islands of Molara and Molarotto are nearby.\nMost of the population of the island was displaced in 1962 when a NATO radiogoniometric station was constructed on the eastern half of the island. The aerials from the station can be seen from quite a distance, and that entire half of the island is restricted to military personnel.\nTavolara is also home of the VLF-transmitter ICV, which works on 20.27\u00a0kHz and 20.76\u00a0kHz and which is used for transmitting messages to submarines. It can also be received (but not decoded) by PCs with a coil antenna at the soundcard entrance and FFT-analysis software.\nThe island and the surrounding waters are part of the Tavolara and Punta Coda Cavallo Marine Preserve created in 1997. The environmental protections placed on the park have added restrictions to the use of the area for tourism.\nA natural column of rock on the island's coast resembles a human figure and is known as \"the Stone Sentry\" or \"Pope's Rock.\" Other stone formations include \"Ulysses' Bow\" (a natural arch) and the \"Grotta del Papa\" (a cave accessible by sea and boasting Neolithic cave paintings).\nFlora and fauna.\nA rare species of thorny knapweed, \"Centaurea horrida\", is endemic only to Tavolara and a few other fringe areas of northern Sardinia. In his \"Natural History of Sardinia\" (1774), Francesco Cetti reported huge rats inhabiting Tavolara, but these were likely Sardinian pikas, an endemic species of lagomorph that had already been driven to extinction in Sardinia proper by then. In the 18th century, Sardinian lore claimed the wild goats of Tavolara had gold teeth. The goat herds were moved to Sardinia when the NATO station was built and it was assumed there are no longer any goats on the island. However, in 2024 goats have been spotted again. The critically endangered monk seal had a breeding colony here until the 1960s. Once the home of a thriving lobster industry, Tavolara now attracts divers who come to view the coral, sponges, sea anemones, bottlenose dolphins, and even a few specimens of \"Pinna nobilis\", the rare giant clam whose byssus fibers were formerly used in the manufacture of sea silk for royal garments.\nHistory.\nThe island was known in ancient times as Hermea. According to tradition, Pope St. Pontian died on Tavolara following his abdication and exile in 235. It is probably the island previously called Tolar, which was used by some Arab ships in 848\u2013849 as a base to attack nearby coasts.\nJoachim Murat visited Tavolara in 1815 during his attempt to regain the Kingdom of Naples. At that time the island was uninhabited.\nIn 1836 the imaginary kingdom of Tavolara was given to the Bertoleoni family by Charles Albert the King of Sardinia.\nAfter Italian unification, \u201cKing Paolo\u201d actively sought recognition from Italy. During his \u201creign\u201d, in 1868 the Italian government began operating a lighthouse on the northeast end of the island.\nThe tomb of one of its members \u201cPaolo I\u201d is in the graveyard on the island, surmounted by a crown.\nVLF- Antenna.\nThe VLF-antenna of Tavolara VLF transmitter is spun between a 133-metre-tall mast at on Spalmatore di Fuori and 4 masts, which are situated on mountains southwards.\nThey are situated at , at , at and at \nThe two masts on the eastern mountain are tall, the two others are smaller.\nIn popular culture.\nTavolara is the name given to a fictional island in the Philippines ruled by a cannibal king, in the 1902 Harvard comic opera \"Queen Philippine.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The related Ancient Greek noun is (\"tagma\"), meaning \"ordinance, command\".\nBoth words root in the verb (\"tasso\"), meaning \"draw up in order, station, appoint\"\nDistinction from strategy.\nA strategy is a set of guidelines used to achieve an overall objective, whereas tactics are the specific actions aimed at adhering to those guidelines.\nMilitary usage.\nIn military usage, a military tactic is used by a military unit of no larger than a division to implement a specific mission and achieve a specific objective, or to advance toward a specific target.\nThe terms tactic and strategy are often confused: tactics are the actual means used to gain an objective, while strategy is the overall campaign plan, which may involve complex operational patterns, activity, and decision-making that govern tactical execution. The United States Department of Defense \"Dictionary of Military Terms\" defines the tactical level as \"the level of war at which battles and engagements are planned and executed to accomplish military objectives assigned to tactical units or task forces. Activities at this level focus on the ordered arrangement and maneuver of combat elements in relation to each other and to the enemy to achieve combat objectives.\"\nIf, for example, the overall goal is to win a war against another country, one strategy might be to undermine the other nation's ability to wage war by preemptively annihilating their military forces.

{"id": "31570", "revid": "50571203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31570", "title": "Battle of the River Plate", "text": "First naval battle of the Second World War\nThe Battle of the River Plate was fought in the South Atlantic on 13 December 1939 as the first British naval battle of the Second World War.\nThe Kriegsmarine heavy cruiser , commanded by Captain Hans Langsdorff, engaged a Royal Navy squadron, commanded by Commodore Henry Harwood, comprising the light cruisers , (on loan to the New Zealand Division) and the heavy cruiser .\n\"Graf Spee\" had sailed into the South Atlantic in August 1939, before the war began, and had begun commerce raiding after receiving the appropriate authorisation on 26 September 1939. Harwood's squadron was one of several search groups sent in pursuit by the British Admiralty and sighted \"Graf Spee\" off the estuary of the River Plate (a.k.a. the ) near the coasts of Argentina and Uruguay.\nIn the ensuing battle, \"Exeter\" was severely damaged and forced to retire, making for the Falklands; \"Ajax\" and \"Achilles\" suffered moderate damage. Damage to \"Graf Spee\", although not extensive, was critical because her fuel system was crippled. \"Ajax\" and \"Achilles\" shadowed the German ship until she entered the port of Montevideo, the capital of neutral Uruguay, to effect urgent repairs. Langsdorff was told that his stay could not be extended beyond 72 hours. Apparently believing that the British had gathered a superior force to await his departure, he ordered for the ship to be scuttled. Langsdorff then committed suicide three days later.\nBackground.\n\"Admiral Graf Spee\" had been at sea at the start of the Second World War in September 1939 and had sunk several merchantmen in the Indian Ocean and South Atlantic Ocean without loss of life because of her captain's policy of taking all crews on board before sinking the victim.\nThe Royal Navy assembled nine forces to search for the surface raider: Force\u00a0G, the South American Cruiser Squadron, comprised the heavy cruiser of with eight guns in four turrets, the heavy cruiser HMS \"Exeter\" of with six guns in three turrets, and two light cruisers, HMS \"Ajax\" and HMNZS \"Achilles\", both of with eight guns. Although technically a heavy cruiser because of the calibre of her guns, \"Exeter\" was a scaled-down version of the County class. The force was commanded by Commodore Henry Harwood whose flagship was \"Ajax\", captained by Charles Woodhouse. \"Achilles\" was on loan to the New Zealand Division (precursor to the Royal New Zealand Navy) and captained by Edward Parry. \"Exeter\" was commanded by Captain Frederick Secker Bell. \nDuring the period before and at the immediate time of the battle, \"Cumberland\" (commanded by Captain Walter Herman Gordon Fallowfield) was refitting in the Falkland Islands but was available for sea at short notice. Force G was supported by the oilers RFA \"Olna\", RFA \"Olynthus\", and RFA \"Orangeleaf\". \"Olynthus\" replenished HMS \"Ajax\" and \"Achilles\" on 22 November 1939, and \"Exeter\" on 26 November, at San Borombon Bay. \"Olynthus\" was also directed to keep observation between Medanos and Cape San Antonio, off Argentina south of the River Plate estuary (see chart below).\nFollowing a raider-warning radio message from the merchantman \"Doric Star\", which was sunk by \"Admiral Graf Spee\" off South Africa, Harwood suspected that the raider would try to strike next at the merchant shipping off the River Plate estuary between Uruguay and Argentina. He ordered his squadron to steam toward the position 32\u00b0 south, 47\u00b0 west. Harwood chose that position, according to his dispatch, because it was the most congested part of the shipping routes in the South Atlantic and therefore the point at which a raider could do the most damage to enemy shipping. A Norwegian freighter saw \"Admiral Graf Spee\" practising the use of her searchlights and radioed that her course was toward South America; the three available cruisers of Force G rendezvoused off the estuary on 12 December and conducted manoeuvres.\nRegarding strategy, the British combat instructions for engaging a pocket battleship with a cruiser squadron had been devised by Harwood himself during his period at the Royal Naval War College between 1934 and 1936. The strategy specified an attack at once, day or night. During the day, the ships would attack as two units, in this case with \"Exeter\" separate from \"Ajax\" and \"Achilles\". At night, the ships would remain in company, but in open order. By attacking from two sides, Harwood hoped to give his lighter warships a chance of overcoming the German advantage of greater range and heavier broadside by dividing the enemy's fire. By splitting his force, Harwood would force the Germans to split their fire and reduce its effectiveness, or to keep it focused on one opponent and allow the other vessels to attack with less fear of return fire.\nAlthough outgunned by \"Admiral Graf Spee\" and therefore at a tactical disadvantage, the British had the upper hand strategically since any raider returning to Germany would have to run the blockade of the North Sea and might reasonably be expected to encounter the Home Fleet. For victory, the British had only to damage the raider enough so that she was either unable to make the journey or unable to fight a subsequent battle with the Home Fleet (by contrast, the Germans would have to destroy the British force without being severely damaged). Because of overwhelming numerical superiority, the loss of even all three cruisers would not have severely altered Britain's naval capabilities, but \"Admiral Graf Spee\" was one of the Kriegsmarine's few capital ships. The British could, therefore, afford to risk a tactical defeat if it brought strategic victory.\nBattle.\nOn 13 December at 05:20, the British squadron was proceeding on a course of 060\u00b0 at 14 knots with \"Ajax\" at , east of Montevideo. At 06:10, smoke was sighted on a bearing of Red-100, or 320\u00b0 (to the north-west). Harwood ordered the \"Exeter\" to investigate. She swung out of line, and at 06:16, she signaled by lamp: \"I think it is a pocket-battleship\". Captain Bell ordered Flag N hoisted to the yard arm \u2013 \"Enemy in sight\". \"Graf Spee\" had already sighted mastheads and identified \"Exeter\" but initially suspected that the two light cruisers were smaller destroyers and that the British ships were protecting a merchant convoy, the destruction of which would be a major prize. Since \"Graf Spee\"'s reconnaissance aircraft was out of service, Langsdorff relied on his lookouts for that information. He decided to engage despite having received a broadly accurate report from the German naval staff on 4 December. It outlined British activity in the River Plate area and included information that \"Ajax\", \"Achilles\", \"Cumberland\" and \"Exeter\" were patrolling the South American coast.\nLangsdorff realised too late that he was facing three cruisers. Calling on the immediate acceleration of his diesel engines, he closed with the enemy squadron at in the hope of engaging the steam-driven British ships before they could work up from cruising speed to full power. An alternative strategy would have been keeping the British ships at a distance to destroy them with his guns and remaining out of range of their smaller 6-inch and 8-inch guns. However, Langsdorff knew the British cruisers had a speed advantage over \"Graf Spee\" and could stay out of range while calling for reinforcements.\nThe British executed their battle plan: \"Exeter\" turned north-west, and \"Ajax\" and \"Achilles\", operating together, turned north-east to spread \"Graf Spee\"'s fire. \"Graf Spee\" opened fire on \"Exeter\" at with her six guns at 06:18. \"Exeter\" opened fire at 06:20, \"Achilles\" at 06:21, \"Exeter\"'s aft guns at 06:22 and \"Ajax\" at 06:23. Lieutenant-Commander Richard Jennings, \"Exeter\"'s gunnery officer remembers:\nAs I was crossing the compass platform [to his Action Station in the Director Control Tower], the captain hailed me, not with the usual rigmarole of \"Enemy in sight, bearing, etc\", but with \"There's the fucking \"Scheer\"! Open fire at her!\" Throughout the battle the crew of the \"Exeter\" thought they were fighting the [sister ship] \"Scheer\". But the name of the enemy ship was of course the \"Graf Spee\".\nFrom her opening salvo, \"Graf Spee\"'s gunfire proved fairly accurate, her third salvo straddling \"Exeter\". At 06:23, a shell burst just short of \"Exeter\", abreast the ship. Splinters from the shell killed the torpedo tubes' crews, damaged the ship's communications, riddled the ship's funnels and searchlights and wrecked the ship's Walrus aircraft just as it was about to be launched for gunnery spotting. Three minutes later, \"Exeter\" suffered a direct hit on her \"B\" turret, putting it and its two guns out of action. Shrapnel swept the bridge, killing or wounding all bridge personnel except the captain and two others. Captain Bell's communications were wrecked. Communications from the aft conning position were also destroyed. The ship had to be steered via a chain of messengers for the rest of the battle.\nMeanwhile, \"Ajax\" and \"Achilles\" closed to and started making in front of \"Graf Spee\", causing her to split her main armament at 06:30 and otherwise use her guns against them. Shortly after, \"Exeter\" fired two torpedoes from her starboard tubes but both missed. At 06:37, \"Ajax\" launched her Fairey Seafox spotter floatplane from her catapult. At 06:38, \"Exeter\" turned so that she could fire her port torpedoes and received two more direct hits from shells. One hit \"A\" turret and put it out of action, the other entered the hull and started fires. \"Exeter\" was severely damaged, having only \"Y\" turret still in action under \"local\" control, with Jennings on the roof shouting instructions to those inside. She also had a 7\u00b0 list, was being flooded and being steered with the use of her small boat's compass. However, \"Exeter\" dealt the decisive blow; one of her 8-inch shells had penetrated two decks before exploding in \"Graf Spee\"'s funnel area, destroyed her raw fuel processing system and left her with just 16 hours fuel, insufficient to allow her to return home.\nAt this point, nearly one hour after the battle had started, \"Graf Spee\" was doomed since she could not make fuel system repairs of that complexity under fire. Two thirds of her anti-aircraft guns were knocked out, as well as one of her secondary turrets. There were no friendly naval bases within reach or reinforcements available. She was not seaworthy and could make only the neutral port of Montevideo.\n\"Graf Spee\" hauled round from an easterly course, now behind \"Ajax\" and \"Achilles\", towards the north-west and laid smoke. That course brought Langsdorff roughly parallel to \"Exeter\". By 06:50, \"Exeter\" listed heavily to starboard and took water forward. Nevertheless, she still steamed at full speed and fired with her one remaining turret. Forty minutes later, water splashed in by a near miss short-circuited her electrical system for that turret. Captain Bell was forced to break off the action. That would have been the opportunity to finish off \"Exeter\". Instead, the combined fire of \"Ajax\" and \"Achilles\" drew Langsdorff's attention as both ships closed the German ship.\nTwenty minutes later, \"Ajax\" and \"Achilles\" turned to starboard to bring all their guns to bear, causing \"Graf Spee\" to turn away and lay a smoke screen. At 07:10, the two light cruisers turned to reduce the range from even though that meant that only their forward guns could fire. At 07:16, \"Graf Spee\" turned to port and headed straight for the badly damaged \"Exeter\", but fire from \"Ajax\" and \"Achilles\" forced her at 07:20 to turn and fire her guns at them, while they turned to starboard to bring all their guns to bear. \"Ajax\" turned to starboard at 07:24 and fired her torpedoes at a range of , causing \"Graf Spee\" to turn away under a smoke screen. At 07:25, \"Ajax\" was hit by a shell that put \"X\" turret out of action and jammed \"Y\" turret, causing some casualties. By 07:40, \"Ajax\" and \"Achilles\" were running low on resources, and the British decided to change tactics and move to the east under a smokescreen. Harwood decided to shadow \"Graf Spee\" and try to attack at night, when he could attack with torpedoes, better use his advantages of speed and manoeuvrability and minimise his deficiencies in armour. \"Ajax\" was again hit by a shell that destroyed her mast and caused more casualties. \"Graf Spee\" continued to the south-west.\nPursuit.\nThe battle now turned into a pursuit. Captain Parry of \"Achilles\" wrote afterwards: \"To this day I do not know why the \"Admiral Graf Spee\" did not dispose of us in the \"Ajax\" and the \"Achilles\" as soon as she had finished with the \"Exeter\"\". The British and New Zealand cruisers split up, keeping about from \"Admiral Graf Spee\". \"Ajax\" kept to the German's port and \"Achilles\" to the starboard. At 09:15, \"Ajax\" recovered her aircraft. At 09:46, Harwood signalled to \"Cumberland\" for reinforcement and the Admiralty also ordered ships within to proceed to the River Plate. \nAt 10:05, \"Achilles\" had overestimated \"Admiral Graf Spee\"'s speed and came into range of the German guns. \"Admiral Graf Spee\" turned and fired two three-gun salvoes with her fore guns. \"Achilles\" turned away under a smokescreen.\nAccording to Dudley Pope, a merchant ship was sighted at 11:03 close to \"Admiral Graf Spee\". After a few minutes, \"Admiral Graf Spee\" called \"Ajax\" on W/T, probably on the international watchkeeping frequency of 500\u00a0kHz, and used both ships' pre-war call signs, with the signal: \"please pick up lifeboats of English steamer\". The German call sign was DTGS, confirming to Harwood that the pocket-battleship he had engaged was indeed \"Admiral Graf Spee\". \"Ajax\" did not reply, but a little later, the British flagship closed with SS \"Shakespeare\" with her lifeboats still hoisted and men still on board. \"Admiral Graf Spee\" had fired a gun and ordered them to stop but when they did not obey orders to leave the ship, Langsdorff decided to continue on his way, and \"Shakespeare\" had a lucky escape. The shadowing continued for the rest of the day until 19:15, when \"Admiral Graf Spee\" turned and opened fire on \"Ajax\", which turned away under a smokescreen.\nIt was now clear that \"Admiral Graf Spee\" was entering the River Plate estuary. Since the estuary had sandbanks, Harwood ordered \"Achilles\" to shadow \"Admiral Graf Spee\" while \"Ajax\" would cover any attempt to double back through a different channel. The sun set at 20:48, with \"Admiral Graf Spee\" silhouetted against the sun. \"Achilles\" had again closed the range and \"Admiral Graf Spee\" opened fire, forcing \"Achilles\" to turn away. During the battle, a total of 108 men had been killed on both sides, including 36 on \"Admiral Graf Spee\".\n\"Admiral Graf Spee\" entered Montevideo in neutral Uruguay and dropped anchor at about 00:10 on 14 December. That was a political error since Uruguay, while neutral, had benefited from significant British influence during its development and favoured the Allies. The British Hospital, for example, where the wounded from the battle were taken, was the leading hospital in the city. The port of Mar del Plata on the Argentine coast and south of Montevideo would have been a better choice for \"Admiral Graf Spee\". Also, had \"Admiral Graf Spee\" left port at the time, she would have encountered no British warships in the area except for the damaged \"Ajax\" and \"Achilles\".\nTrap of Montevideo.\nIn Montevideo, the 13th Hague Convention came into play. Under Article 12, \"belligerent war-ships are not permitted to remain in the ports, roadsteads or territorial waters of the said Power for more than twenty-four hours\". Under Article 14, a \"belligerent war-ship may not prolong its stay in a neutral port beyond the permissible time except on account of damage\". British diplomats duly pressed for the speedy departure of the \"Graf Spee\". Also relevant was Article 16 of which part reads, \"A belligerent war-ship may not leave a neutral port or roadstead until twenty-four hours after the departure of a merchant ship flying the flag of its adversary\".\nIn accordance with their obligations, the Germans released 61 captive British merchant seamen who had been on board. Langsdorff then asked the Uruguayan government for two weeks to make repairs. Initially, the British diplomats in Uruguay, principally Eugen Millington-Drake, made several requests for \"Admiral Graf Spee\" to leave port immediately. After consultation with London, which was aware that there were no significant British naval forces in the area, Millington-Drake continued to demand for \"Admiral Graf Spee\" to leave. At the same time, he arranged for British and French merchant ships to steam from Montevideo at intervals of 24 hours, whether they had originally intended to do so or not, thus invoking Article 16. That kept \"Admiral Graf Spee\" in port and allowed more time for British forces to reach the area.\nAt the same time, the British attempted to feed false intelligence to the Germans that an overwhelming British force was being assembled, including Force H (the aircraft carrier and the battlecruiser ) by broadcasting a series of signals, on frequencies known to be intercepted by German intelligence. In fact, the two cruisers had been joined only by \"Cumberland\", which had arrived at 22:00 on 14 December, after steaming from the Falkland Islands in 34 hours, at an average of over 90% of her full trials speed attained over much shorter distances. The older and larger \"Cumberland\" was more powerful than \"Exeter\", with an additional aft turret containing two more 8-inch guns, but it was no match for \"Admiral Graf Spee\" whose guns had significantly longer range and fired much heavier shells (660 lb against 256 lb). Overwhelming British forces (HMS \"Renown\", \"Ark Royal\", , , and ) were \"en route\" but would not assemble until 19 December although they could intercept earlier if \"Admiral Graf Spee\" headed north or north-east from Montevideo shadowed by \"Cumberland\" and her smaller consorts. For the time being, the total force comprised the undamaged \"Cumberland\" with a full ammunition load, and the damaged \"Ajax\" and \"Achilles\" with depleted stocks of shells. To reinforce the propaganda effect, these ships, which were waiting just outside the three-mile limit, were ordered to make smoke, which could be clearly seen from the Montevideo waterfront.\nOn 15 December 1939, \"Olynthus\" refuelled \"Ajax\", which proved a difficult operation. The ship had to use hurricane hawsers to complete the replenishment. On 17 December \"Achilles\" was replenished from \"Olynthus\" off Rouen Bank.\nThe Germans were entirely deceived and expected to face a far superior force on leaving the River Plate. \"Admiral Graf Spee\" had also used two thirds of her ammunition and had enough left for approximately only a further 20 minutes of firing. Such a reduced ammunition stock was hardly sufficient for the ship to fight her way out of Montevideo against the large force expected, let alone get back to Germany. Even the only actual British newcomer, the previously unengaged \"Cumberland\", could fight at full capacity for about 90 minutes and pursue at equal or higher speed for at least another before she required replenishment at sea.\nMeanwhile, as the \"Graf Spee\" remained in the bay, British diplomatic personnel based in Montevideo and Buenos Aires carefully watched her from shore 24 hours a day, and the expectation of a potential breakout and resumption of the battle caused tensions and anxiety to surge to enormous levels among British sailors and diplomats.\nOn the German side, while the ship was prevented from leaving the harbour, Captain Langsdorff consulted with his command in Germany. He received orders that permitted some options but not internment in Uruguay. The Germans feared that Uruguay could be persuaded to join the Allied cause. Ultimately, he chose to scuttle his ship in the River Plate estuary on 17 December to avoid unnecessary loss of life for no particular military advantage, a decision that infuriated Adolf Hitler.\nThe crew of \"Admiral Graf Spee\" were taken to Buenos Aires, Argentina, where Captain Langsdorff shot himself on 19 December. He was buried there with full military honours, and several British officers attended. Many of the crew members made their homes in Montevideo with the help of local people of German origin. The German dead were buried in the Cementerio del Norte, Montevideo.\nAftermath.\nThe German propaganda machine had reported that \"Admiral Graf Spee\" had sunk a heavy cruiser and heavily damaged two light cruisers and had been only lightly damaged herself. The scuttling of \"Admiral Graf Spee\", however, was a severe embarrassment and difficult to explain on the basis of publicly available facts. The battle was a major victory for the British, as the damage to \"Ajax\" and \"Achilles\" was not sufficient to reduce their fighting efficiency, and \"Exeter\", as badly damaged as she was, had managed to reach the Falkland Islands for emergency repairs. \nLieutenant Atwill, who wrote an account of the battle in which he served on \"Exeter\", detailed the damage done and the emergency repairs to make the ship seaworthy enough to reach Stanley, Falkland Islands. There were rumours that she would remain there and become a rusting hulk until the end of the war, but First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill wrote to the First Sea Lord and others, \"We ought not readily to accept the non-repair during the war of \"Exeter\". She should be strengthened and strutted internally as far as possible . . . and come home\". \"Exeter\" returned to Devonport for a 13-month refit, enhancing Churchill's reputation.\nWhile highly praised for his excellent performance in battle, Harwood received criticism directed towards his lack of initiative and for not employing a more aggressive approach; those criticisms are mostly due to \"Admiral Graf Spee\" being allowed to escape though outnumbered by ships able jointly to make a more damaging rate of fire.\nPrisoners taken from merchant ships captured by \"Admiral Graf Spee\" who had been transferred to her supply ship \"Altmark\" were freed by a boarding party from the British destroyer in the \"Altmark\" incident (16 February 1940) in J\u00f8ssingfjord, at the time neutral Norwegian waters. Prisoners who had not been transferred to \"Altmark\" had remained aboard \"Admiral Graf Spee\" during the battle; they were released on arrival in Montevideo.\nOn 22 December 1939, over 1,000 sailors from \"Admiral Graf Spee\" were taken to Buenos Aires and interned there; at least 92 were transferred during 1940 to a camp in Rosario, some were transferred to Club Hotel de la Ventana in Buenos Aires Province and another group to Villa General Belgrano, a small town founded by German immigrants in 1932. Some of these sailors later settled there. After the war many German sailors settled permanently in various parts of Uruguay, some returning after being repatriated to Germany. Rows of simple crosses in the Cementerio del Norte, in the north of the city of Montevideo, mark the burial places of the German dead. Three sailors killed aboard \"Achilles\" were buried in the British Cemetery in Montevideo, while those who died on \"Exeter\" were buried at sea.\nIntelligence gathering and salvage.\nImmediately after her scuttling, the wreck of \"Admiral Graf Spee\" rested in shallow water, with much of the ship's superstructure remaining above water level, but over the years, the wreck has subsided into the muddy bottom, and only the tip of the mast remains above the surface.\nA radar expert was sent to Montevideo shortly after the scuttling and reported a rotating aerial, probably for gunlaying, transmitting on either 57 or 114 centimetres. In February 1940, the wreck was boarded by United States Navy sailors from the light cruiser .\nPieces and parts of the ship have also been displayed in museums and studied by scientists who have carried out tests like metallurgical analyses of the \"Graf Spee\".\nIn 1964 a memorial to the ship was erected in Montevideo's port. Part of it is \"Admiral Graf Spee\"'s anchor.\nIn 1997, one of \"Admiral Graf Spee\"'s secondary gun mounts was raised and restored; it can now be seen outside Montevideo's National Maritime Museum.\nIn February 2004, a salvage team began work raising the wreck. The operation is being funded in part by the government of Uruguay, in part by the private sector, as the wreck is now a hazard to navigation. The first major section, the heavy gunnery control station, was raised on 25 February 2004. It is expected to take several years to raise the entire wreck. James Cameron filmed the salvage operation. After she has been raised, it is planned that the ship might be restored and put on display at the National Marine Museum.\nMany German veterans did not approve of the restoration attempt, as they considered the wreck to be a war grave and an underwater historical monument that should be respected. One of them, Hans Eupel, a former specialist torpedo mechanic, 87 years old in 2005, said that \"this is madness, too expensive and senseless. It is also dangerous, as one of the three explosive charges we placed did not explode\".\nOn 10 February 2006, the , 400\u00a0kg eagle and swastika crest of \"Admiral Graf Spee\" was recovered from the stern of the ship. The spread-wing statue of a Nazi eagle with a wreath in its talons containing a swastika was attached to the stern, not the bow like traditional figureheads. It was a common feature of prewar German warships. In other cases, it was removed for a variety of practical reasons on the outbreak of the war, but because \"Admiral Graf Spee\" was already at sea when the war began, she went into action and was scuttled with it attached, which permitted its recovery. To protect the feelings of those with painful memories of Nazi Germany, the swastika at the base of the figurehead was covered as it was pulled from the water. The figurehead was stored in a Uruguayan naval warehouse after German complaints about exhibiting \"Nazi paraphernalia\".\nLegacy.\nIn 1956, the film \"The Battle of the River Plate\" (US title: \"Pursuit of the Graf Spee\") was made of the battle and \"Admiral Graf Spee\"'s end, with Peter Finch as Langsdorff and Anthony Quayle as Harwood. Finch portrays Langsdorff sympathetically as a gentleman. The \"Achilles\", which had been recommissioned in 1948 as HMIS \"Delhi\", flagship of the Royal Indian Navy, played herself in the film. HMS \"Ajax\" (twin turrets) was \"played\" by HMS \"Sheffield\" (triple turrets), HMS \"Exeter\" (twin turrets) by HMS \"Jamaica\" (triple turrets) and HMS \"Cumberland\" by herself (although de-gunned as a trials platform). \"Admiral Graf Spee\" (two turrets) was portrayed by the U.S. heavy cruiser (three turrets).\nThe incomplete Battle-class destroyer HMS \"River Plate\" was named after the battle.\nThe battle was for many years re-enacted with large-scale model boats throughout the summer season at Peasholm Park in the English seaside resort of Scarborough. The re-enactment now portrays an anonymous battle between a convoy of British ships and an unspecified enemy in possession of the nearby shore.\nAfter the battle, the new town of Ajax, Ontario, in Canada, constructed as a Second World War munitions production centre, was named after HMS \"Ajax\". Many of its streets are named after Admiral Harwood's crewmen on \"Ajax\", \"Exeter\" and \"Achilles\". Its main street is named after Admiral Harwood, while a small street was named (after some controversy) for Captain Langsdorff. According to an article in the German language paper \"Albertaner\" on 6 October 2007, Steve Parish, the mayor of Ajax, defended the decision, declaring that Langsdorff had not been a typical Nazi officer. An accompanying photograph (in the \"Aftermath\" section above) from the funeral of crew members shows Langsdorff paying tribute with a traditional naval salute, while people beside and behind him\u00a0\u2013 even some clergymen\u00a0\u2013 are giving the Fascist salute. The street name was changed in 2021 in response to public opposition.\nAlso in Canada, the names of the ships, and the commander of Force G, have been used for Cadet Corps. The Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corps (RCSCC) Ajax No. 89 in Guelph, Ontario; the Navy League Cadet Corps (NLCC) Achilles No. 34 in Guelph, Ontario; the Navy League Wrenette Corps (NLWC) Lady Exeter (now disbanded) and the camp shared by all three corps, called Camp Cumberland (this camp no longer exists; it was decommissioned around 1999). RCSCC Harwood No. 244 and NLCC Exeter No. 173 are situated in Ajax, Ontario.\nA number of streets in Nelson Bay, New South Wales, have been named after the battle including Montevideo Parade, Achilles Street, Ajax Avenue, Harwood Avenue, and Exeter Road (now called Shoal Bay Road). In Auckland, home port of the Royal New Zealand Navy, streets have been named for \"Achilles\", \"Ajax\" and \"Exeter\". Three streets in North Wollongong, New South Wales, are named Ajax Avenue, Exeter Avenue and Achilles Avenue.\nThe battle is also significant as it was the first time the Flag of New Zealand was flown in battle, from HMS \"Achilles\". Also in New Zealand, four mountain peaks in the Two Thumb Range region of the South Island are named in commemoration of the battle. These are Achilles (2,544\u00a0m), Exeter (2,327\u00a0m), Ajax (2,319\u00a0m) and Graf Spee (2,267\u00a0m).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31571", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31571", "title": "Trillium", "text": "Genus of flowering plants\nTrillium (trillium, wakerobin, toadshade, tri flower, birthroot, birthwort, and sometimes \"wood lily\") is a genus of about fifty flowering plant species in the family Melanthiaceae. \"Trillium\" species are native to temperate regions of North America and Asia, with the greatest diversity of species found in the southern Appalachian Mountains in the southeastern United States.\nDescription.\nPlants of this genus are perennial herbs growing from rhizomes. There are three large leaf-like bracts arranged in a whorl about a scape that rises directly from the rhizome. There are no true aboveground leaves but sometimes there are scale-like leaves on the underground rhizome. The bracts are photosynthetic and are sometimes called leaves. The inflorescence is a single flower with three green or reddish sepals and three petals in shades of red, purple, pink, white, yellow, or green. At the center of the flower there are six stamens and three stigmas borne on a very short style, if any. The fruit is fleshy and capsule-like or berrylike. The seeds have large, oily elaiosomes.\nOccasionally individuals have four-fold symmetry, with four bracts (leaves), four sepals, and four petals in the blossom.. The tetramerous condition has been described for several species of \"Trillium\" including \"T.\u00a0chloropetalum\", \"T.\u00a0erectum\", \"T.\u00a0grandiflorum\", \"T.\u00a0maculatum\", \"T.\u00a0sessile\", and \"T.\u00a0undulatum\".\nTaxonomy.\nIn 1753, Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus established the genus \"Trillium\" by recognizing three species, \"Trillium cernuum\", \"Trillium erectum\", and \"Trillium sessile\". The type specimen \"Trillium cernuum\" described by Linnaeus was actually \"Trillium catesbaei\", an oversight that subsequently led to much confusion regarding the type species of this genus.\nInitially the \"Trillium\" genus was placed in the family Liliaceae. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries it was sometimes placed in a smaller family, Trilliaceae. By 1981 Liliaceae had grown to about 280\u00a0genera and 4,000\u00a0species. As it became clearer that the very large version of Liliaceae was polyphyletic, some botanists preferred to place \"Trillium\" and related genera into that separate family. Others defined a larger family, Melanthiaceae, for a similar purpose, but included several other genera not historically recognized as close relatives of \"Trillium\". This latter approach was followed in 1998 by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, which assigned the genus \"Trillium\", along with its close relative \"Paris\", to the family Melanthiaceae. \nHowever, other taxonomists have since preferred to break up the heterogenous Melanthiaceae into several smaller monophyletic families, each with more coherent morphological features, returning \"Trillium\" to a resurrected Trilliaceae.\nIn 1850, German botanist Carl Sigismund Kunth segregated \"Trillium govanianum\" Wall. ex D.Don into genus \"Trillidium\". Some authorities consider \"Trillidium\" Kunth to be a synonym for \"Trillium\" L., while others recognize the taxon \"Trillidium govanianum\" (Wall. ex D.Don) Kunth based on morphological differences (with other \"Trillium\" species) and molecular evidence. Still others support the segregation of \"Trillium undulatum\" Willd. into genus \"Trillidium\" alongside \"Trillidium govanianum\".\nSubdivisions.\nAll names used in this section are taken from the International Plant Names Index. As of February 2022[ [update]], Plants of the World Online (POWO) accepts 49\u00a0species and 5\u00a0named hybrids, all of which are listed below. The geographical locations are taken from POWO and the Flora of North America, except where noted.\nThe \"Trillium\" genus has traditionally been divided into two subgenera, \"Trillium\" subgenus \"Trillium\" and \"Trillium\" subgenus \"Phyllantherum\", based on whether the flower is pedicellate or sessile. At the time, the former subgenus was considered to be the more primitive group. Based on molecular systematics, \"Trillium\" subgen.\u00a0\"Phyllantherum\" has been shown to be a monophyletic group, but its segregation renders the remaining \"Trillium\" subgen.\u00a0\"Trillium\" paraphyletic.\n\"Trillium\" subgenus \"Phyllantherum\" was named by Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1820, but since he did not provide a description, the name was declared invalid in 2014. At that time, the correct name was thought to be \"Trillium\" subgen.\u00a0\"Sessilium\", which was described by Rafinesque in 1830. However, that name was later found to be incorrect as well. As of July 2022[ [update]], the correct name of the subgenus is \"Trillium\" L. subgen.\u00a0\"Sessilia\" Raf. Its type species is \"Trillium sessile\" L.\nIn 1819, Rafinesque described and named the genus \"Delostylis\", and then placed \"Trillium stylosum\" Nutt. (now a synonym for \"Trillium catesbaei\" Elliott) into the new genus. Reversing himself a decade later, Rafinesque instead placed \"Trillium stylosum\" into a new subgenus \"Delostylium\" in 1830. Presumably Rafinesque had intended the subgeneric name to replace the earlier generic name, and so the correct name of the former is \"Trillium\" L. subgen.\u00a0\"Delostylis\" (Raf.) Raf.. Its type species is \"Trillium catesbaei\". Historically, the subgenus has been known as the Catesbaei group. The word \"Delostylis\" means \"with a small but conspicuous style\".\nBased on morphology and molecular evidence, a few taxa in genus \"Trillium\" have been segregated into other genera:\nPhylogenetic analysis places \"Trillidium govanianum\" and \"Trillidium undulatum\" together in a clade with high support. However, since \"Trillium\" and \"Trillidium\" are both individually and collectively monophyletic, it is a matter of choice whether or not to recognize genus \"Trillidium\".\nExcluding the segregate taxa listed above, the remaining taxa separate into four clades with the following names:\nTraditionally, \"Trillium\" subgen.\u00a0\"Trillium\" has included all pedicellate-flowered species (which is a paraphyletic group), but in 2022, the subgenus was circumscribed as a clade of fourteen (14) species. Its type species is \"Trillium erectum\" L. Historically, the subgenus has been known as the Erectum group.\n\"Trillium\" subgen.\u00a0\"Callipetalon\" was described by Jayne A.\u00a0Lampley and Edward E.\u00a0Schilling in 2022. The word \"Callipetalon\" means \"beautiful petal\", a reference to \"the famously beautiful flowers\" of its type species, \"Trillium grandiflorum\" (Michx.) Salisb. Historically, the subgenus has been known as the Grandiflorum group.\nThis leads to a four-part concept of \"Trillium\" that sharply contrasts with the traditional pedicellate vs.\u00a0sessile dichotomy outlined previously.\nSubgenus \"Trillium\".\n\"Trillium\" subgen.\u00a0\"Trillium\", the Erectum group, is a group of pedicellate-flowered trilliums that includes \"Trillium erectum\". The subgenus was circumscribed as a clade of fourteen (14) species in 2022. Species in this subgenus have pedicellate flowers (on a stalk) with three distinct stigmas (no style) and solid green leaves (not mottled). They are distributed across North America and Asia. Hybrids are common within this subgenus (the only group of pedicellate-flowered trilliums with natural hybrids).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSubgenus \"Callipetalon\".\n\"Trillium\" subgen.\u00a0\"Callipetalon\", the Grandiflorum group, is a group of pedicellate-flowered trilliums that includes \"Trillium grandiflorum\". The subgenus was circumscribed as a clade of three (3) species in 2022. Species in the subgenus have pedicellate flowers (on a stalk) and solid green leaves (except \"T.\u00a0ovatum\" on the west coast of California, which occasionally has mottled leaves). The stigmas are fused together at their bases (basally connate) but lack a definite style. They are distributed across North America (but not Asia). Flowers were and still are consumed and used by indigenous peoples in various regions of North America.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSubgenus \"Delostylis\".\n\"Trillium\" subgen.\u00a0\"Delostylis\", the Catesbaei group, is a group of pedicellate-flowered trilliums that includes \"Trillium catesbaei\". The subgenus was circumscribed as a clade of seven (7) species in 2022. Species in this subgenus have pedicellate flowers (except for one variety of \"T.\u00a0pusillum\") with a definite style and solid green leaves (not mottled). Distribution is restricted to the southeastern and south central United States.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSubgenus \"Sessilia\".\n\"Trillium\" subgen.\u00a0\"Sessilia\", the sessile-flowered trilliums, is a group of species that includes \"Trillium sessile\". The subgenus was circumscribed as a clade of twenty-six (26) species in 2022. Species in this subgenus have sessile flowers (no flower stalk), erect petals (except in \"T.\u00a0stamineum\"), and mottled leaves (except in \"T.\u00a0petiolatum\" and occasionally in plants of other sessile-flowered species).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nUngrouped taxa.\nThe following pair of taxa do not fit into any of the above groups since they are markedly different from other \"Trillium\" species. There is evidence to support the segregation of these species into a separate genus (\"Trillidium\") but the proposal is controversial.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther taxa.\nAs of April 2023[ [update]], Plants of the World Online does not accept these taxa:\nThe following taxa are of historical interest:\nDistribution.\n\"Trillium\" species are native to North America and Asia.\nNorth America.\nMore than three dozen \"Trillium\" species are found in North America, most of which are native to eastern North America. Just six species are native to western North America: \"T.\u00a0albidum\", \"T.\u00a0angustipetalum\", \"T.\u00a0chloropetalum\", \"T.\u00a0kurabayashii\", \"T.\u00a0ovatum\", and \"T.\u00a0petiolatum\". Of these, only \"T.\u00a0ovatum\" is pedicellate-flowered.\nCanada.\n\"Trillium\" species are found across Canada, from Newfoundland to southern British Columbia. The greatest diversity of species are found in Ontario, Quebec, and Nova Scotia.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nUnited States.\nExcept for the desert regions of the southwestern United States, \"Trillium\" species are found throughout the contiguous U.S. states. In the western United States, species are found from Washington to central California, east to the Rocky Mountains. In the eastern United States, species range from Maine to northern Florida, west to the Mississippi River valley. \"Trillium\" species are especially diverse in the southeastern United States, in Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, North Carolina, and South Carolina. The state of Georgia is home to 21\u00a0species of trillium.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAsia.\nIn Asia, the range of \"Trillium\" species extends from the Himalayas across China, Korea, Japan, and eastern Russia to the Kuril Islands. The greatest diversity of \"Trillium\" species is found on the islands of Japan and Sakhalin.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIdentification.\nA fully general dichotomous key requires a mature, flowering plant. The first step is to determine whether or not the flower sits on a pedicel, which determines the subgenus. (Any mature plant may be identified to this extent, even if it is not in bloom.) Identification proceeds based on flower parts, leaves, and other characteristics. A combination of characteristics is usually required to identify the plant.\nIdentification of a non-flowering, non-fruiting plant with bare leaves may be difficult. Although some species of \"Trillium\" have petioles (leaf stalks) and/or distinctive leaf shapes, these features are seldom sufficient to identify the plant down to the species level.\nIn eastern North America, jack-in-the-pulpit (\"Arisaema triphyllum\") is often mistaken for bare-leaved \"Trillium\". Both species are about the same height with trifoliate leaves but the former lacks 3-way rotational symmetry and has leaf veins unlike those of \"Trillium\".\nEcology.\nTrilliums are myrmecochorous, that is, ants act as agents of seed dispersal. Each seed of a ripe fruit has a white fleshy appendage called an elaiosome. Ants are attracted to the elaiosome, so much so they often bore holes into the fruit instead of waiting for it to drop off on its own. The ants carry the seeds back to their nest where they eat the elaiosomes and discard the seeds. Here the seeds eventually germinate, an average of about 1\u00a0meter away from the parent plant.\nFor example, the seeds of \"Trillium camschatcense\" and \"T. tschonoskii\" are collected by ant species \"Aphaenogaster smythiesi\" and \"Myrmica ruginodis\". Sometimes beetles interfere with the dispersal process by eating the elaiosomes, which makes the seeds less attractive to ants.\nYellow jackets (\"Vespula\" spp.) and other wasps are similarly attracted to elaiosomes. The wasps carry off the seeds and feed on the elaiosomes an average of about 1.4\u00a0meters away from the parent plant. Yellow jackets are documented seed dispersers for at least three species of \"Trillium\" (\"T.\u00a0catesbaei\", \"T.\u00a0cuneatum\", \"T.\u00a0undulatum\").\nThe seeds of some \"Trillium\" species are more attractive to ants than others. Widely distributed species (e.g., \"Trillium grandiflorum\", \"Trillium catesbaei\", and \"Trillium cuneatum\") are more attractive to ants than narrowly endemic species (e.g., \"Trillium lancifolium\", \"Trillium discolor\", and \"Trillium decumbens\").\nHybrids.\nAs of February 2022[ [update]], Plants of the World Online recognizes five named hybrids, four in Asia and one in North America. Three of the Asian hybrids, \"T.\" \u00d7 \"hagae\", \"T.\" \u00d7 \"miyabeanum\", and \"T.\" \u00d7 \"yezoense\", are well studied, but little is known about the Asian hybrid \"T.\" \u00d7 \"komarovii\". One of its parents is \"T.\u00a0camschatcense\" but the other parent is unknown.\nThe only named hybrid in North America is \"T.\" \u00d7 \"crockerianum\" whose type specimen was collected in Del Norte County, California. As originally described, its parents are \"Trillium ovatum\" and \"Trillium rivale\", but the latter species is now a member of genus \"Pseudotrillium\", and so \"T.\" \u00d7 \"crockerianum\" has become an intergeneric hybrid.\nIn 1982, Haga and Channell crossed the Asiatic species \"Trillium camschatcense\" with several North American species. Of those, the crosses with \"T.\u00a0erectum\", \"T.\u00a0flexipes\", and \"T.\u00a0vaseyi\" produced solid, seemingly viable seed. Seeds of the cross between \"T.\u00a0camschatcense\" and \"T.\u00a0erectum\" flowered in 9 to 10\u00a0years.\nDisease.\nVarious \"Trillium\" species are susceptible to a greening disorder caused by bacterial organisms called phytoplasmas that alter the morphology of infected plants. Symptoms of phytoplasma infection include abnormal green markings on the petals (floral virescence), extra leaves (phyllody), and other abnormal characteristics. Infected populations occur throughout the species range but are prevalent in Ontario, Michigan, and New York.\nFor many years, this condition was thought to originate from mutation, and so many of these forms were given taxonomic names now known to be invalid. In 1971, Hooper, Case, and Meyers used electron microscopy to detect the presence of mycoplasma-like organisms (i.e., phytoplasmas) in \"T.\u00a0grandiflorum\" with virescent petals. The means of transmission was not established but leafhoppers were suspected. As of November 2021[ [update]], the insect vector for \"Trillium\" greening disorder is unknown.\nPhytoplasmas were positively identified in \"T.\u00a0grandiflorum\" and \"T.\u00a0erectum\" in Ontario in 2016. Phylogenetic analysis supported the grouping of the phytoplasmas isolated from infected plants as a related strain of \"'Candidatus\" Phytoplasma pruni' (subgroup 16SrIII-F) with 99% sequence identity. This subgroup of phytoplasmas is associated with various other diseases, including milkweed yellows, \"Vaccinium\" witches' broom, and potato purple top.\nConservation.\nPicking parts off a trillium plant can kill it even if the rhizome is left undisturbed. Some species of trillium are listed as threatened or endangered and collecting these species may be illegal. Laws in some jurisdictions may restrict the commercial exploitation of trilliums and prohibit collection without the landowner's permission. In the US states of Michigan and Minnesota it is illegal to pick trilliums. In New York it is illegal to pick the red trillium.\nIn 2009, the Ontario Trillium Protection Act, a Private Members Bill, was proposed in the Ontario legislature that would have made it illegal to in any way injure the common \"Trillium grandiflorum\" (white trillium) in the province (with some exceptions), however the bill was never passed. The rare \"Trillium flexipes\" (drooping trillium) is also protected by law in Ontario, because of its decreasing Canadian population.\nHigh white-tailed deer population density has been shown to decrease or eliminate trillium in an area, particularly white trillium. As such height of trillium can be used as an indicator for white-tailed deer population density within forested and urban areas to help forest regeneration.\nSome species are harvested from the wild to an unsustainable degree. This is particularly dire in the case of \"T.\u00a0govanianum\", whose high selling price as a folk medicine has motivated harvesters to destroy swathes of ecologically sensitive Himalayan forests, causing mudslides.\nMedicinal uses.\nSeveral species contain sapogenins. They have been used traditionally as uterine stimulants, the inspiration for the common name birthwort. In a 1918 publication, Joseph E. Meyer called it \"beth root\", probably a corruption of \"birthroot\". He claimed that an astringent tonic derived from the root was useful in controlling bleeding and diarrhea.\nCulture.\nThe white trillium (\"Trillium grandiflorum\") serves as the official flower and emblem of the Canadian province of Ontario. It is an official symbol of the Government of Ontario. The large white trillium is the official wildflower of Ohio. In light of their shared connection to the flower, the Major League Soccer teams in Toronto and Columbus compete with each other for the Trillium Cup.\nCitizen scientists regularly report observations of \"Trillium\" species from around the world. \"T.\u00a0grandiflorum\", \"T.\u00a0erectum\", and \"T.\u00a0ovatum\" (in that order) are the most often observed \"Trillium\" species.\n\"Trillium\" is the literary magazine of Ramapo College of New Jersey, which features poetry, fiction, photography, and other visual arts created by Ramapo students.\nIn the 1990s, the activist Michael Page established the use of the trillium as a symbol of bisexuality, and in 2001, Francisco Javier Lagunes Gait\u00e1n and Miguel Angel Corona designed a Mexican variant of the bisexual pride flag, which is emblazoned with an emblem of a trillium.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Morgenstern\". The novel purports to explain why the gondoliers of Venice no longer sing, through the story of the protagonist Luigi. Chapters I and II build up further mythology behind the name Morgenstern and the backstory of Gondolierian history, and the tale of Luigi actually starts in Chapter III.\nIt was released in hardcover in 1983, and a trade paperback version came out from Del Rey in 2001. Paul Giovanopoulos provided 20 pen-and-ink illustrations for the story.\nAuthor.\nGoldman also uses the pseudonym \"S. Morgenstern\" in his better-known novel, \"The Princess Bride\". However, in this tale, he writes as if he remembers spending Christmas in Venice, with the echo of singing gondoliers, once as a child and again with his wife and daughters. The story haunts him and he begins to research. This leads him into the trail of why gondoliers can no longer sing well, contrary to the belief that \"gondoliers are the greatest singers of the world\".\nSynopsis.\nLuigi is an aspiring gondolier in Venice. Though he is a talented boatman, he is a terrible singer, and people get stomach cramps and migraines just listening to him. As gondoliers have a reputation as the best singers in the world, and customers expect it as part of the service, a tone-deaf gondolier is unacceptable, no matter how skilled he is with his oar..\nAs the story unfolds, his fiancee Laura Lorenzini breaks off her engagement, and marries a 'better suitor'. Though he is an awful singer, Luigi's friends are fond of him and his affable nature. It is agreed that although he cannot be a gondolier, he can work in the Tavern, the Gondoliers' exclusive haunt. But over time he becomes dissatisfied.\nLuigi disappears for many years, and is turned away from various singing teachers. Finally Piccoli agrees to teach him, although unbeknown to Luigi, Piccoli has not taught in many years and is deaf. Luigi eventually returns to Venice and sings, but his singing is even worse because it has become more powerful. When a 'killer storm' approaches, everyone is in danger. When the Church of Souls of Those Who Died for the Sea, the most sacred building to the Gondoliers, is struck by lightning, even the most skilled gondoliers in Venice are too overcome with fear to go out and call for the Great Fireboat of Venice to save their church from fire.\nFinally, Luigi manages to reach the Great Fireboat of Venice, which sets out to save the church. The other gondoliers notice that Luigi did not return with the fireboat, and discover him sailing on the turbulent waters of the Grand Canal. Covered by the noise of the storm, Luigi is finally able to realize his dream of singing on the Grand Canal, singing songs from Bellini and all the solos he knows. All the gondoliers witness this and they talk about it all night.\nAfter the storm, the Queen of Corsica visits. She requests a gondolier to sing for her on her royal boat. One gondolier starts to sing \"\u2019O sole mio\", but sings terribly to the queen's disgust. It is discovered that all gondoliers have started to sing terribly from that moment on, and so no-one asks them to sing anymore.\nLuigi is reinstated as a gondolier, without the requirement to sing. After a long career and happy life, as with all gondoliers when they die, Luigi is set in his black boat and pushed out into the Adriatic Sea.\nBackground.\nGoldman says he got the idea to write the book when visiting Venice with his then-wife:\nWe were on one of the water buses, Vaporettos, and a bunch of gondoliers came rowing down the canal and they were quiet. I suddenly turned to [my wife] Ilene and I said, 'I know why the gondoliers don't sing' and we got off the bus immediately and I went running back to the hotel. I wrote the story down in about five minutes on a piece of paper.\nGoldman says this was one of the few times that a novel had popped into his head \"fully formed\", the other being \"No Way to Treat a Lady\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As a singer, Curry has released three rock-focused studio albums: \"Read My Lips\" (1978), \"Fearless\" (1979), and \"Simplicity\" (1981).\nEarly life.\nTimothy James Curry was born on 19 April 1946 in Grappenhall, Cheshire, the son of school secretary Patricia and Royal Navy chaplain James Curry. The Currys had met in Malta and married in Egypt. He had an elder sister, Judith. Within a year of Curry's birth, the family moved to Hong Kong. During Curry's early childhood, the family moved to a different British seaside town every 18 months or so, eventually settling in Plymouth when Curry was 11.\nJames Curry suffered a stroke when Curry was 11 years of age. Weeks later, in 1958, James Curry died of pneumonia. The Curry family then moved to South London, where he attended boarding school. Curry later attended Kingswood School in Bath, Somerset. Curry developed into a talented boy soprano. Deciding to concentrate on acting, he graduated from the University of Birmingham with a combined BA degree in English and drama in 1968.\nCareer.\nActing.\n\"Rocky Horror\".\nCurry's first full-time role was as part of the original London cast of the musical \"Hair\" in 1968, where he met Richard O'Brien, who went on to write Curry's role of Dr. Frank-N-Furter in \"The Rocky Horror Show\" (1973). Curry recalled his first encounter with the project:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I'd heard about the play because I lived on Paddington Street, off Baker Street, and there was an old gym a few doors away. I saw Richard O'Brien in the street, and he said he'd just been to the gym to see if he could find a muscleman who could sing. I said, \"Why do you need him to sing?\" [laughs] And he told me that his musical was going to be done, and I should talk to Jim Sharman. He gave me the script, and I thought, \"Boy, if this works, it's going to be a smash.\"\nOriginally, Curry rehearsed the character with a German accent and peroxide blond hair, and later, with an American accent. In March 2005, in an interview with Terry Gross of NPR's \"Fresh Air,\" he explained that he decided to play Dr. Frank-N-Furter with an English accent after listening to an English woman say, \"Do you have a house in town or a house in the country?,\" and decided, \"Yes, [Dr. Frank-N-Furter] should sound like the Queen.\"\nCurry originally thought the character was merely a laboratory doctor dressed in a white lab coat. However, at the suggestion of director Sharman, the character evolved into the diabolical mad scientist and transvestite with an upper-class Belgravia accent. An immediate hit, a reviewer at the premiere in London in June 1973 wrote that Curry gives a \"garishly Bowiesque performance as the ambisextrous doctor.\" This change carried over to the 1975 film adaptation, \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\", which made Curry a household name and gave him a cult following. Curry continued to play the character in London, Los Angeles, and New York City until 1975.\nIn an interview with NPR, Curry called \"Rocky Horror\" a \"rite of passage\", and added that the film is \"a guaranteed weekend party to which you can go with or without a date and probably find one if you don't have one, and it's also a chance for people to try on a few roles for size, you know? Figure out, help them maybe figure out their own sexuality\".\nIn 2016, Curry played the Criminologist in the of \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\". In 2025, Curry was an invited guest speaker at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures to celebrate the film's 50th anniversary.\nTheatre.\nShortly after the end of \"Rocky Horror\"'s run on Broadway, Curry returned to the stage with Tom Stoppard's \"Travesties\", which ran in London and New York from 1975 to 1976. \"Travesties\" was a Broadway hit. It won two Tony Awards (Best Performance by an Actor for John Wood and Best Comedy), as well as the New York Drama Critics Circle Award (Best Play), and Curry's performance as the famous dadaist Tristan Tzara received good reviews.\nIn 1980, Curry formed part of the original cast in the Broadway show \"Amadeus\", playing the title character, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Curry was nominated for his first Tony Award (Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play) for this role but lost out to his co-star Ian McKellen, who played Antonio Salieri. In 1982, Curry took the part of the Pirate King in the Drury Lane production of Joe Papp's version of Gilbert and Sullivan's \"The Pirates of Penzance\" opposite George Cole and Pamela Stephenson, earning enthusiastic reviews.\nIn the mid-1980s, Curry performed in \"The Rivals\" and in several plays with the Royal National Theatre of Great Britain, including \"The Threepenny Opera\", \"Dalliance\" and \"Love For Love\". From 1987 to 1988, he did the national tour of \"Me and My Girl\" in the lead role of Bill Snibson, a role originated on Broadway by Robert Lindsay. In 1989, Curry returned once again to the New York stage in \"The Art of Success\", and in 1992 played Alan Swann in the Broadway version of \"My Favorite Year\", earning him his second Tony Award nomination, this time for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical. In 2001, Curry appeared as Scrooge in a musical version of the Charles Dickens novella \"A Christmas Carol\" that played at Madison Square Garden.\nIn 2004, Curry began his role of King Arthur in \"Spamalot\" in Chicago. Directed by Mike Nichols, written by Monty Python member Eric Idle and based on \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\", the show successfully moved to Broadway in February 2005. It sold more than $1\u00a0million worth of tickets in its first 24 hours. His performance brought him a third Tony nomination, again for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical. Curry reprised this role at the Palace Theatre in the West End, where \"Spamalot\" opened on 16 October 2006. His final performance came on 6 January 2007. Curry was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for his work in \"Spamalot\", and he also won the Theatregoers' Choice Award (receiving 39% of the votes cast by over 12,000 theatregoers) as Best Actor in a Musical.\nFrom May to August 2011, Curry was scheduled to portray the Player in a Trevor Nunn stage production of Tom Stoppard's \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\" at the Chichester Festival Theatre and then in London. Curry withdrew from the production on 27 May, citing ill health but later admitting that he was fired for being unable to memorize his lines. From 26 to 29 April 2012, he appeared in Eric Idle's play \"What About Dick?\" at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles. Curry had originally appeared at a script reading for the play back in 2007 when it was still a work in progress.\nCurry's career in theatre was honoured on 7\u00a0June 2015 at the Actors Fund's 19th annual Tony Awards Viewing Party, where he was awarded an Artistic Achievement Award.\nFilm.\nAfter \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" (1975), Curry began to appear in many films, acting in supporting roles, such as Robert Graves in the horror film \"The Shout\" (1978), as Johnny LaGuardia in \"Times Square\" (1980), as Daniel Francis \"Rooster\" Hannigan in John Huston's 1982 film version of \"Annie\", and as Jeremy Hancock in the political film \"The Ploughman's Lunch\" (1983). In 1985, Curry starred in the fantasy film \"Legend\" as The Lord of Darkness. Director Ridley Scott cast Curry in the film after watching him in \"Rocky Horror\", thinking he was ideal to play the role of Darkness. It took five and a half hours to apply the makeup needed for Darkness onto Curry and at the end of the day, he would spend an hour in a bath in order to liquefy the soluble spirit gum. The same year, Curry appeared in the comedy mystery film \"Clue\" as Wadsworth the butler.\nStarting in the 1990s, Curry began to appear more frequently in Hollywood film productions, including comedic roles such as Dr. Thornton Poole in \"Oscar\" (1991), Mr. Hector, the suspicious Plaza Hotel concierge in \"\" (1992), Jigsaw in \"Loaded Weapon 1\" (1993), and as Long John Silver in \"Muppet Treasure Island\" (1996).

He also starred in the 1998 direct-to-video film \"Addams Family Reunion\" playing Gomez Addams.\nIn the early 2000s, Curry's big screen appearances lessened, but he did portray Roger Corwin in the film adaptation of \"Charlie's Angels\" (2000), Professor Oldman in the parody film \"Scary Movie 2\" (2001), and Thurman Rice in the biographical film \"Kinsey\" (2004). His last major role in a feature film was as Alexander Monro in the British black comedy \"Burke &amp; Hare\" (2010).\nIn 2024, he had a cameo appearance in the horror film \"Stream\", providing the voice of the mask character \"Lockwood\".\nTelevision.\nCurry started his career with small roles in television series, such as Eugene in \"Napoleon and Love\" (1974), and guest roles in \"Armchair Theatre\" and the BBC's \"Play for Today\" including as Glen in Dennis Potter's \"Schmoedipus\" (1974). He played William Shakespeare in the John Mortimer-scripted six part mini-series \"Will Shakespeare\" (1978). Broadcast on ITV in the UK and distributed internationally by ITC, it traces the bard's life from 1590 until his death. Curry had further roles in British television throughout the 1970s and 1980s, including the lead in Stephen Frears' 1975 adaptation of \"Three Men in a Boat\", playing Bill Sikes in \"Oliver Twist\" (1982), playing aspiring actor-singer Larry Gormley in \"Blue Money\" (1985), and starring as the Grand Wizard in the children's Halloween film \"The Worst Witch\" (1986).\nCurry then moved permenantly to the United States, and appeared in American television production: he appeared in the \"Dead Dog Records\" storyline of the television series crime drama \"Wiseguy\" (1989) as Winston Newquay, and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for portraying all three members of a deranged family in \"Tales from the Crypt\" (1993). He also had recurring roles on the short-lived science fiction television series \"Earth 2\" (1994) and the sitcom \"Rude Awakening\" (1999\u20132000). Although Curry has appeared in numerous television series throughout his career, he has only had lead roles in two live-action series: \"Over the Top\" (1997), a sitcom that he also produced, and the revival series of \"Family Affair\" (2002\u20132003). Both were cancelled after one season. Around this time, Curry also made a single episode appearance on the live-action comedy-detective series \"Psych\" (2007) as Nigel St. Nigel, a Simon Cowell esque judge on a singing competition show being targeted. He returned to working on British television in the late 2000s, with the miniseries adaptation of \"Terry Pratchett's The Colour of Magic\" (2008), a guest appearance on the long-running \"Agatha Christie's Poirot\" (2008) and the miniseries \"Return to Cranford\" (2009).

He has mentioned that his musical influences included jazz vocalists such as Billie Holiday and Louis Armstrong, and he idolised The Beatles and The Rolling Stones as a teenager. In 1978, A&amp;M Records released Curry's debut solo album \"Read My Lips\". The album featured an eclectic range of songs (mostly covers) performed in diverse genres. Highlights of the album are a reggae version of the Beatles' song \"I Will\", a rendition of \"Wake Nicodemus\" featuring the Pipes and Drums of the 48th Highlanders of Canada, and a bar-room ballad, \"Alan\", composed by Canadian singer-songwriter Tony Kosinec.

However, the album remained unreleased in its entirety until February 2010, when it was made available as a legal download entitled \"...From the Vaults\" (though four tracks from these sessions had been released on a 1990 \"Rocky Horror\" box set). The album, produced by Lou Adler, included Curry's rendition of the Supremes' hit \"Baby Love\".\nPersonal life.\nCurry has never married and does not have children. He does not consider his relationship history to be a public matter.\nA keen horticulturalist, Curry has developed and restored gardens across many of his past residences and some other residences in Los Angeles. On where his interest in gardening came from, he commented: \"I think if you're English, a trowel appears in your hand when you're 30 like a prosthetic device\".\nA former smoker, Curry has stated that he has used hashish and cocaine. He has also spent time in alcohol rehabilitation, but does not consider himself an alcoholic.\nIn 2012, Curry had a major stroke in the midst of receiving a massage.

It was devised by Fintan Coyle and Cathy Dunning and developed for television by the BBC Entertainment Department. The game begins with a team of nine contestants (eight in the revival), who take turns answering general knowledge questions within a time limit to create chains of nine correct answers in a row. At the end of each round, the players then vote one contestant, \"the weakest link\", out of the game. After two players are left, they play in a head-to-head penalty shootout format, with five questions asked to each contestant in turn, to determine the winner.\nHistory.\nThe first original episode was broadcast on 14 August 2000. The show was presented by Anne Robinson and narrated by Jon Briggs. It ran in different variations, originally as a daytime series, but also at primetime and with celebrity contestants playing for charity with a modified set and format. The format has since been produced around the world, most notably in the United States, where Robinson was the original presenter.\nOn 22 April 2011, Anne Robinson announced that she would end her role as the quiz show's presenter by the time her contract would expire as she had served longer than she had originally intended. The original run ended on 31 March 2012 with its 1,693rd, and final episode.\nRevivals.\nIn November 2017, The Weakest Link returned for a celebrity Children in Need edition, marking the 1,694th episode of the programme. The 40-minute edition aired on 17 November 2017 on BBC Two at 10pm GMT.\nIn June 2021, a 12-episode primetime revival with celebrity contestants and Romesh Ranganathan as host was announced. The revival premiered on BBC One on 18 December 2021. In March 2022, the revival was renewed for a second series, which premiered on 17 December 2022. In February 2023, the revival was renewed for a third series.\nFormat.\nThe original format features nine contestants, who take turns answering general knowledge questions. The objective of every round is to create a chain of nine correct answers in a row and earn an increasing amount of money within a time limit. One wrong answer breaks the chain and loses any money earned within that particular chain. However, before their question is asked, a contestant can choose to bank the current amount of money earned in any chain to make it safe, after which the chain starts afresh. A contestant's decision not to bank, in anticipation of being able to correctly answer the upcoming question allows the money to grow, as each successive correct answer earns proportionally more money.\nWhen the allotted time for every round ends, any money which is not banked is lost, and if the host is in the middle of asking a question, or has asked a question but the contestant has yet to answer, the question is abandoned. If the question is completed, the host gives the correct answer whether the contestant is able to answer the question correctly or not. The round automatically ends if the team successfully reaches the maximum amount for the round before the allotted time expires, and the next person says \"Bank\", or (in the revival) says \"bank\" and presses a button on their podium. Round 1 starts with 3 minutes on the clock (2 minutes and 30 seconds on the revival), every round thereafter (except round 8) is reduced by 10 seconds as players are eliminated. For Round 8, the last or final round, the remaining two players only have 90 seconds (1:30) to triple whatever they bank.\nIn the original series, the first person to be asked a question in the first round was the player whose name was first alphabetically. In the revival, it is a randomly chosen player. Every subsequent round starts with the \"strongest link\"\u2014the player with the most correct answers from the previous round, unless that person has been voted off, in which case the second strongest link answers first.\nSeven timed rounds are played in the 2021 revival, with question values and target totals increasing every two rounds. The final round is played for double value. The target begins at \u00a32,500 in the first round and increases to \u00a310,000 in the seventh (the real target of which is \u00a320,000), allowing for a potential maximum bank of \u00a350,000.\nMoney chains.\nQuestion and target values during the daytime and primetime runs of the series are displayed in the table below.\nVoting and elimination.\nAt the end of every round, contestants must vote one player out of the game. During the voting process, the narrator reveals to the viewers, though not the players, who the statistical strongest and weakest links were. While the contestants work as a team when answering questions, they are at this point encouraged to be ruthless with one another. Players often decide to vote off weaker rivals, but occasionally decide to eliminate stronger players as well, in hope that it then improves their chances of winning the game. After the revealing of the votes, the host will interrogate the players on their choice of voting, the reasons behind their choice, as well as their performance, background and their interests. After interrogation, the player with the most votes is given a stern \"You are the weakest link. Goodbye!\" or \"I'm sorry to say that with [#] votes, you are the weakest link. Goodbye!\" and must walk off the stage in what is called the \"Walk of Shame.\" The eliminated contestant then delivers a brief confessional, summing up the experience of the show and occasionally taunting the team for voting them off, as well as providing opinion as to who is voted off next, and who is likely to win.\nIn the event of a tie or draw, the strongest link must decide which of the tied players is eliminated. The strongest link is allowed to change their vote if they voted for one of the tied players; they usually do not, unless a different player voted for their elimination.\nFinal round.\nThe last two contestants work together in the eighth and final round identical to the previous ones, however, all money banked at the end of this round is tripled and added to the current money total, forming the final total for the game. At the end of this round, there is no elimination, with the game instead moving to the head-to-head round.\n\"Head to head\" round.\nFor the head-to-head round, the remaining two players are each required to answer five questions each in a penalty shootout format. The strongest link from the previous round chooses who goes first. Whoever has the most correct answers at the end of the round wins the game. In the event of a tie, the game goes to Sudden Death. Every player continues to be asked questions as usual, until 1 person answers a question correctly and the other incorrectly.\nThe winner of the game is declared \"the strongest link\" and takes home all of the money accumulated in the prize pool for the game, and the loser leaves with nothing, like all previous eliminated players. In daytime episodes, the maximum possible winnings are \u00a310,000; in primetime and special celebrity charity episodes, the maximum is \u00a350,000.\nSpecial editions.\nPrime-time versions.\nFollowing the huge success of the show in its early evening slot on BBC Two, a separate weekly prime-time version was added to BBC One, usually broadcast on Wednesday evenings. These versions of the show were produced on a larger budget than the daytime version, with the addition of higher jackpots and a larger set that included electronic podiums and a studio audience, but had the same rules as the daytime version.\nEarly incarnations.\nThe first primetime version of the show was \"Weakest Link: Champions' League\", which premiered a few months after the original daytime run on 31 October 2000 and ran on Tuesdays. These episodes featured eight previous winners who battled it off once again for a doubled jackpot of \u00a320,000 (with a money tree of \u00a350-\u00a3100-\u00a3200-\u00a3500-\u00a31,000-\u00a31,500-\u00a32,000-\u00a32,500; with the 7th round being a double round for \u00a35,000). Six editions of this version were produced and were not successful in ratings. Although another episode that aired a week after also featured returning contestants, consisting of contestants who deemed themselves to be unfairly voted out previously.\nThe second series of the prime-time editions saw a format change, with seven new contestants playing for the \u00a320,000 jackpot (with a money tree of \u00a350-\u00a3100-\u00a3250-\u00a31,000-\u00a31,750-\u00a32,500; the 6th round being a triple round for \u00a37,500) and the programme length reducing to 35 minutes instead of 40. These episodes normally featured standard contestants with some celebrity editions and ran from January to March 2001 on Mondays, with the last of the series airing on a Thursday.\nCelebrity editions.\nThe third series saw yet another format change for the prime-time editions. The podiums were increased to the standard nine, and the potential prize money was raised to \u00a350,000. With this, the prime-time version increased back to forty-five minutes. Once again, new regular contestants played with occasional celebrity editions, but this had transitioned exclusively to celebrities playing for charity by the fourth series in 2002, and this remained as such until the original show's end.\nAlthough Briggs and Robinson state that 8 players will leave with nothing, normally the losing celebrities receive a \"house\" amount to give to their chosen charity, as well as their own fee for appearing on the show. In some celebrity editions, two celebrities have represented one position in the game, with the two conferring before giving their answer. There have also been several editions featuring entirely celebrity couples. A Christmas edition of the programme was also aired in some years. Some contestants, such as Christopher Biggins, Peter Duncan and Basil Brush, have appeared several times.\nThese editions tended to have a theme in relation to what celebrities were featured, such as a puppet edition where a Robinson puppet introduced the show.\nDaytime editions.\nThe daytime version has also seen its share of variants.\nThe first edition to feature celebrity contestants aired on 24 December 2000, featuring nine celebrities attempting to win \u00a310,000 for a charity of their choosing. As it was simply a special of the daytime series, it didn't feature any of the additions seen in the prime-time version. Shortly after, there were a few specials that aired between 2001 and 2002 that were similar to that of \"Champions' League\" featuring returning contestants, although once again these were just standard daytime episodes.\nAn April Fools' Day show that aired in 2003 featured Robinson being strangely and uncharacteristically nice to the contestants and abandoning her traditional black wardrobe in favour of a metallic pink overcoat. The nice nature of the episode even extended to the normally stoic narrator being much more excited and optimistic in his narration. However, Robinson did not remain kind to the contestants for the entire episode, resuming her old behaviour after declaring the winner and contestants as \"so stupid\".\nAnother variant of the daytime show was the 1,000th episode, which aired in December 2006, with the contestants featured being fan-favourites from previous editions (mostly from the prime-time series). Much like the prime-time version, a studio audience (consisting of previous contestants from the daytime series) was added, although gameplay rules remained the same, with the potential prize money remaining at \u00a310,000. The show's first winner, David Bloomfield was one of the returning contestants, and was asked the question: \"If there have been 1,000 episodes of \"The Weakest Link\", each with 9 players, how many contestants in total have appeared on the show?\" He answered the question correctly (9,000) but banked prior to it being asked. He did not win any money on the 1,000th episode and was voted off in only the 3rd round, despite having been the strongest link in the first two rounds. In the end, Miss Evans (who had previously appeared on the Strong Women special but had lost out to curate Emma Langley) defeated Basil Brush, winning \u00a32,710, which she split with her co-finalist to give to charity. Robinson then announced that a bonus of \u00a31,000 would be added to the final total, as it was the 1,000th episode, resulting in a final total of \u00a33,710, or both contestants receiving \u00a31,855 each. It also marked the first time that Anne Robinson did not say the phrase \"...you leave with nothing.\" to the losing contestant.\nFinal daytime episode (2012).\nThe 1,693rd episode was titled \"You are \"The Weakest Link\" - Goodbye\" and aired on BBC One on 31 March 2012. Filming for the final original edition took place on 11 December 2011. The ending of the show was the only atypical part to the last edition.\nA normal daytime edition of the show was made, with some of Robinson's favourite contestants from over the years taking part, and with no audience present during filming or changes to the money tree (see above). The first round of questions was notably different and was mainly about the \"Weakest Link\" and Robinson. The last question asked was \"If the Roman numeral 'X' is halved, the result can be represented by which other Roman numeral?\", the answer being \"V\". The last UK winner was Archie Bland, the editor of \"The Independent\" newspaper's Saturday edition, who won \u00a32,090.\nA short montage of clips from the show was shown at the end of the game. After saying goodbye, all of the lights turned off with Robinson being the only person left in the studio. The programme was eventually replaced by the Alexander Armstrong-fronted \"Pointless\" as the big BBC teatime quiz, which had previously aired on BBC Two since 2009.\nSuccess.\nMuch of the show's success has been attributed to its host, Anne Robinson. She was already famous in the UK for her sarcasm while presenting \"Points of View\" and the consumer programme \"Watchdog\", and \"Weakest Link\" saw her develop this further, particularly in her taunting of contestants. Her sardonic summary to the team, usually berating them for their lack of intelligence for not achieving the target became a trademark of the show, and her call of \"You are the weakest link\u2014goodbye!\" became a popular catchphrase.\nThe presence of elements inspired by \"Survivor\" and \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" differentiated the programme from most previous quiz shows, as it invites open conflict between players, and uses a host who is openly hostile to the competitors, rather than a positive figure.\nIn autumn 2001, for the first time, \"Weakest Link\" was placed directly head-to-head with \"Millionaire\" in the television schedules. Between the two, \"Millionaire\" ultimately emerged on top, attracting 10.2m viewers compared to \"Weakest Link\"'s 3.8m. Additionally, later in that autumn, due to the show's ever-rising popularity, a videogame based on the show was released for the PlayStation, PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows platforms.\nFrom 9 to 13 August 2010, five \"10th Anniversary Specials\" aired at the usual time on BBC One.\nTransmissions.\nOriginal.\nNOTE: This is not an exhaustive list\nInternational versions.\nThe format has been licensed across the world, with many countries producing their own series of the programme and is the second most popular international franchise, behind only the \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" franchise, which also originated in the UK.\nStrategy for banking money.\nIn a \"New Scientist\" blog article, Erica Klarreich argues that there are only two sensible strategies in \"Weakest Link\" (the American edition) when it comes to banking money. Either players should choose to bank after every correct answer, or after six straight correct answers to maximize the pot. The correct strategy to take will depend upon the team members' skill at answering questions. For all but the weakest teams, the optimal strategy is to raise the pot six straight times without banking. But since this happens so seldom on the show, Klarreich argues, the dominant strategy will usually be instead to bank after every question. The common practice of banking after just three questions would only outperform the strategy of banking after every question if a team maintained a success rate of over 67%.\nCultural references.\nAnne Robinson's catchphrase \"You are the weakest link. Goodbye!\" has appeared in popular culture, including references in \"Family Guy\", \"Scary Movie 2\", \"How I Met Your Mother\", \"The Garfield Show\" and \"The League of Gentlemen\".\nThe comedy series \"That Mitchell and Webb Look\" broadcast a sketch based on \"Weakest Link\" called \"Hole in the Ring\", featuring Robert Webb as an overly harsh presenter who makes mistakes whilst reading questions.\nTwo fictional television shows, \"Doctor Who\" and \"My Family\", have depicted their own versions of \"Weakest Link\" in their episodes. The \"Doctor Who\" edition, broadcast in 2005, depicts a futuristic version of the show in the year 200,100, with only six contestants and presented by an 'Anne Droid' (voiced by Anne Robinson). A later special edition of \"Weakest Link\" features nine cast members of \"Doctor Who\" playing the game, and the show is introduced by the Anne Droid. The real Anne walks on stage almost instantly as the droid begins the show, unplugs it, and says, \"I don't think so. I think we'll do that again.\" She then presents the show herself and proceeds as normal.\nIn the seventh series of the British television show \"My Family\", broadcast in 2007, the main characters Ben, Susan, Janey, Michael, Abi, Roger, and Alfie, along with Susan's mother and her husband, compete on the show for a special family edition, after Michael forges all of their signatures to get on it. The real Anne Robinson guest stars as the host.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31575", "revid": "45417033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31575", "title": "Tandy Corporation", "text": "Retail company based in Fort Worth, Texas, United States (1919\u20132000)\nTandy Corporation was an American family-owned retailer based in Fort Worth, Texas that made leather goods, operated the RadioShack and Tandy electronics stores, and later built personal computers. \nTandy Leather was founded in 1919 as a leather supply store. By the end of the 1950s, under the tutelage of then-CEO Charles Tandy, the company expanded into the hobby market, making leather moccasins and coin purses, making huge sales among Scouts, leading to a fast growth in sales. Aiming to broaden the company horizon, Charles Tandy acquired a number of craft retail companies, including RadioShack in 1963, then an almost bankrupt chain of electronics stores in Boston.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, now led by John Roach as CEO, the corporation started to invest into the personal computer market following the introduction of the popular TRS-80; it was one of the pioneers in the rising personal computer industry, being lauded by the magazine \"Financial World\" as \"the driving force at the front-running company in the red-hot personal computer race\". Unable to keep up with cost-cutting competitors, Tandy exited the PC business in 1993, selling its assets to AST Research, retaining its profitable goods-making units. In 2000, the Tandy Corporation name was dropped, and the entity became the RadioShack Corporation.\nHistory.\nTandy began in 1919 when two friends, Norton Hinckley and Dave L. Tandy, decided to start the Hinckley-Tandy Leather Company and concentrated their efforts on selling sole leather and other supplies to shoe repair dealers in Texas. Hinckley and Tandy opened their first branch store in 1927 in Beaumont, Texas and in 1932, Dave Tandy moved the store from Beaumont to Houston, Texas. Tandy's business survived the economic storms of the Depression, gathered strength and developed a firm presence in the shoe findings (i.e. shoemakers' tools and supplies) business.\nDave Tandy had a son, Charles David Tandy, who was drafted into the business during his early twenties. Charles obtained a B.A. degree at Texas Christian University, then began attending the Harvard Business School to further expand his education. As World War II escalated Charles was called to serve his country in the military and relocated to Hawaii. He wrote to his father from overseas suggesting that leathercraft might offer new possibilities for growing the shoe finding business since the same supplies were used widely in Navy and Army hospitals and recreation centers. Leathercraft gave the men something useful to do and their handiwork, in addition to being therapeutic, had genuine value.\nCharles Tandy returned home from the service as a lieutenant commander in 1948 and negotiated to operate the fledgling leathercraft division himself. He had encouraged and followed the development of that venture through correspondence with his father. Within a short time Charles succeeded in opening the first of two retail stores in 1950 that specialized exclusively in leathercraft.\nHinckley did not share the enthusiasm of Dave and Charles Tandy for the new leathercraft division. As a result, the two original founders came to an agreement in 1950 that Hinckley would continue to pursue the shoe findings business and the Tandy partners would specialize in promoting leathercrafts.\nThe first Tandy Catalog, only eight pages long, was mailed to readers of \"Popular Science\" magazine who had responded to two-inch test ads that were placed by Tandy. From 1950 forward Tandy operated retail mail order stores supported by direct mail advertising. This successful formula helped the company expand into a chain of some 150 leathercraft stores. A growing do-it-yourself movement, prompted by a shortage of consumer goods and high labor costs, continued to gather momentum. The fifteen leathercraft stores opened during this division's first two years of operation became quite successful. Tandy began expanding by gaining new product lines; the first acquisition was with the American Handicrafts Company which featured a broad line of do-it-yourself handicraft products, two established retail stores in the New York market, and useful knowledge of school and institutional markets. Sixteen additional retail stores were opened in 1953, and by 1955 Tandy Leather was a thriving company with leased sales sites in 75 cities across the United States.\nTandy Leather became an attractive commodity and was purchased in 1955 by the American Hide and Leather Company of Boston, whose name changed in 1956 to General American Industries (GAI). Charles continued to maintain control of managing the Tandy Leather division while owned by GAI. During 1956, General American Industries acquired three other companies unrelated to the leather industry and a struggle for control of the parent company began. Charles saw the need to emancipate the company from continuing in the direction initiated by GAI. He used all his resources, raised additional money, and exercised his right to purchase the 500,000 shares of stock that were included in the original settlement. When the votes were counted on the day of that pivotal stockholders meeting, the Tandy group took management control of General American Industries.\nAcquisition of Merribee and RadioShack.\nIn 1961, the company name was changed to Tandy Corporation. The corporate headquarters were also moved to Fort Worth, Texas, where Charles D. Tandy became the president and chairman of the board. Tandy Leather was operating 125 stores in 105 cities of the United States and Canada and expanding significantly. Tandy acquired the assets of Merribee Art Embroidery Co., manufacturer and retailer of needlecraft items, as well as five other companies, including Cleveland Crafts Inc. and brought on the owner, Werner Magnus, to help run the newly acquired Merribee division.\nThe first Tandy Mart had twenty-eight different shops all devoted to craft and hobby merchandise and included American Handicraft, Tandy Leather, Electronics Crafts and Merribee in an area of about 40,000 square feet. Charles Tandy became intrigued with the potential for rapid growth that he saw in the electronics retail industry during 1962. He found RadioShack in Boston, a mail order company that had started in the 1920s selling to amateur radio operators and electronics buffs. By April 1963, the Tandy Corporation acquired management control of RadioShack Corporation and within two years, RadioShack's $4 million (~$ in 2024) loss was turned into a profit under the leadership of Charles Tandy.\nSales were going well for Tandy during this time. Under the leadership of Lloyd Redd (president) and Al Patten (VP of Operations), the company prospered. The number of Tandy store-fronts skyrocketed over the next five to six years by growing from 132 sites in 1969 to 269 sites in 1975. Ground broke in downtown Fort Worth for the construction of the Tandy Towers in 1975. The 18-story office building was initiated as phase I of a massive downtown development with plans to cover eight city blocks and become the new headquarters of the Tandy Corp. It contained an upscale retail shopping center with an indoor ice skating rink and had its own privately owned subway system.\nThe company's board of directors then announced a plan to separate Tandy's businesses into three distinct publicly held companies. The two new companies were named Tandycrafts, Inc. and Tex Tan-Hickok, Inc. This plan was publicized as a strategy to provide intensive leadership and tailored management of the three distinct and diverse businesses of the company, each of which recently had reached a substantial size. With this transition, RadioShack and Tandy Leather Company were no longer under the same corporate umbrella. Wray Thompson was promoted to president of Tandy Leather Company in 1976 and Dave Ferrill was promoted to the position of National Sales Manager; they oversaw 288 stores. Although they opened their 300th store that year, the popularity of Nature-Tand's products had begun to slide.\nCharles Tandy died on November 4, 1978, at the age of 60. Concurrently, key stakeholders began to question the direction of the company. Wray Thompson subsequently resigned from his position as president and later started The Leather Factory with Ron Morgan, which eventually purchased Tandy Leather Corporation in 2000.\nComputers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We've got a very easy business. We get up in the morning, and the only thing we have to do is figure out how to beat IBM, Apple, AT&amp;T, and Japan, Inc.\nTandy was one of three companies (along with Commodore International and Apple) that started the personal computer revolution in 1977 by introducing complete pre-assembled microcomputers instead of a kit. Their TRS-80 (1977) and TRS-80 Color Computer (\"CoCo\") (1980) line of home computers were popular in the years before the IBM PC became commonplace, and had wide distribution in Radio Shack stores at a time when there were few computer stores.\nTandy had 60 Radio Shack Computer Centers by 1980, and expected to have 250 Radio Shack stores that sold its entire computer product line by the end of 1981. By then computers were the most important part of Tandy's sales. The company attempted to monopolize software and peripheral sales by keeping technical information secret and not selling third-party products in Tandy-owned stores. An experimental Tandy computer store at company headquarters sold non-Tandy products until the company banned doing so. A market research company reported in 1981 that not selling others' products slowed Tandy's growth, and predicted that competitors would benefit.\nDiscussing the report, Wayne Green, publisher of \"80 Microcomputing\", warned that the company might have become overconfident from defeating \"poorly financed and inadequately managed competitors\", and that IBM and others would not likely be \"as myopic and hidebound as Radio Shack\". He wrote that had Tandy continued its experiment, \"they might have a couple of thousand Tandy Computer Centers around the country, instead of the Byte Shops and Computerlands we now see. And Tandy would have had a lot more control over Apple and other upstarts\". In 1982 he wrote that while its thousands of stores were once a \"considerable advantage\" over competitors, \"the Shack is falling way behind in sales outlets and thus in sales ... we've seen the Apple come along and, with fewer outlets, pass the TRS-80 by in sales\". Green warned that the company needed to make \"soul-searching, perhaps painful, decisions\". Citing a recent study by \"Time\" finding what he described in May 1983 as \"a severe loss\" of Tandy market share, Green said \"Until some major changes are made in the approach to computer sales by most Radio Shack stores, I expect that businessmen will be put off by the adjacent counters of toys and gadgets\".\nTandy's market share\u2014as high as 60% at one time\u2014indeed declined by 1983 because of competition from the IBM PC and lack of third-party products. Tandy adopted the IBM PC compatible architecture with the Tandy 1000 and Tandy 2000 (1983\u20131984). The 1000 helped Tandy achieve a 25% personal computer market share in 1986, tied with Apple and in second place behind IBM.\nIn 1982, Tandy Corporation entered into a development contract with Oklahoma-based software company Dorsett Educational Systems, known for its 25 years pioneering educational technology. The deal resulted in dozens of titles being released for the TRS-80 Color Computer.\nRadio Shack stores sold TRS-80 computers with other products, while Radio Shack Computer Centers only sold computers. Non-company-owned franchises sold Radio Shack products, including computers, and non-Radio Shack items. Value-added resellers distributed relabelled versions of Tandy computers. Despite selling computers through old-fashioned, department-store-like Sunday-newspaper inserts that emphasized price instead of technology and functionality, by 1980 \"InfoWorld\" described Radio Shack as \"the dominant supplier of small computers\". and in 1981 \"one of the best marketers in the computer industry\". Adam Osborne that year described Tandy as \"one of the great enigmas of the industry\". He wrote of his amazement that a company \"with so few roots in microcomputing\" was the \"number-one microcomputer manufacturer\" while \"selling computers out of Radio Shack stores, no less?\" Green suggested in 1982 that stores separate computers from toys to convince \"middle-income (-class) customers that Radio Shack stores are not primarily dealers in schlock for the unwary lower-income people\". James Fallows that year wrote, while praising Scripsit, that he at first \"had snobbishly resisted Radio Shack because of the low-rent appearance of its products\". A \"BYTE\" reviewer admitted in 1983 that he at first dismissed the Model 100 \"as a toy\" because he saw it in a store next to a radio-controlled car, stating that \"it's too bad that Radio Shack is associated with toys and CB radio\" when the computer \"shows tremendous planning and foresight\".\nIn 1984, a sell-side analyst stated that Tandy had an \"impressive product line, magnificent distribution capability, control of the whole process from manufacturing through distribution, and a reasonably nimble management that is willing to move with the product cycle\". Roach described his company as \"basically a distribution system for high technology products\", with 500 Radio Shack Computer Centers and 800 to 900 \"Plus\" stores, Radio Shack locations with a large computer section. By then computers were 35% of Radio Shack sales; the Model 100 was the world's best-selling notebook computer, while Tandy was the leading Unix vendor by volume, selling almost 40,000 units of the 68000-based, multiuser Tandy Model 16 with Xenix,\nThe company's association with consumers likely hurt a 1982 attempt at direct sales to companies, despite Tandy avoiding the Radio Shack name. It began selling all computers using the Tandy brand because, an executive admitted, \"we were told by customers that the Radio Shack name was a problem in the office\". In the mid-1980s, it began selling peripherals compatible with non-Tandy products such as the IBM PC. The company also mandated in 1986 an IBM-like dress code for store employees. In 1987, \"BYTE\" wrote that \"Tandy might now be offering the most extensive lines of computer products in the world\", including the $99 Color Computer 2, $499 Model 102 notebook, various PC compatibles, and the $3,499 Tandy 6000 Xenix system. The company acquired GRiD Systems in March 1988. Grid Systems was a laptop manufacturer whose products included the GRiD Compass (1982), GridCase (1985), GridLite (1987), and GridPad (1989) tablet computer.\nTandy also produced the short-lived Tandy 1100FD and Tandy 1100HD notebooks. Released in 1989, the 1100 Series was based on the popular NEC V20 processor clocked at 8\u00a0MHz. Tandy also produced software for its computers in the form of Tandy Deskmate. That same year, Tandy introduced the WP-2, a solid-state notebook computer that was a rebadged Citizen CBM-10WP. Eventually, in the early 1990s, Tandy Corporation sold its computer-manufacturing business to AST Computers, and all Tandy computer lines were terminated. When that occurred, Radio Shack stores began selling computers made by other manufacturers, such as Compaq. In 1992, the company introduced the Tandy Zoomer, a predecessor to the Palm Pilot, designed by Jeff Hawkins. Also that year, the company produced an interactive, multimedia CD-ROM player called the Tandy Video Information System (VIS). Like the Tandy computers, it was based on the IBM PC architecture and used a version of Microsoft Windows. Tandy even produced a line of floppy disks, and continued producing IBM PC compatibles until the end of the Intel 486 era.\nTandy stores.\nIn 1973, Tandy Corporation began an expansion program outside their home market of the US, opening a chain of RadioShack-style stores in Europe and Australia under the Tandy name. The first store to open was in Aartselaar, Belgium on August 9, 1973. The first UK store opened October 11, 1973, in Hall Green, Birmingham. Initially, these new stores were under direct ownership of Tandy Corporation. In 1986, Tandy Corporation formed its subsidiary InterTAN as separate entity though connections between them were still visible. For example, catalogue number compatibility was maintained so that the same catalogue number in both companies would refer to the same item.\nTandy stores in the UK sold mainly own-brand goods under the 'Realistic' label and the shops were distinguished on the high street by continuing to use written sales receipts and a cash drawer instead of a till as late as the early 1990s. Staff were required to take the name and address of any customer who made a purchase, however small, in order to put them on the company's brochure mailing list, which often caused disgruntlement. A popular feature of Tandy stores was the free battery club, in which customers were allowed to claim a certain number of free batteries per year. In the early 1990s, the chain ran the 'Tandy Card' store credit card scheme and the 'Tandy Care' extended warranty policies which were heavily marketed by staff.\nIn 1999, the UK stores were acquired by Carphone Warehouse, as a part of an expansion strategy that saw the majority of the Tandy stores converted either to Carphone Warehouse or Tecno photographic stores. In May 2000, the Tandy name was dropped and the official name became RadioShack Corporation. By 2001, all former Tandy stores had been converted or closed. A small number of the stores were sold to a new company called T2 Retail Ltd formed by former Tandy (Intertan UK) employees, Dave Johnson, Neil Duggins and Philip Butcher who continued the RadioShack-style theme for a while, but these stores also closed in 2005. A new company called T2 Enterprises now continues using the old T2 Retail web presence as an exclusively on-line retailer stocking a range of RadioShack products and other electronics. In 2012, Tandy Corporation Ltd, a UK company, acquired the UK rights to the Tandy brand from RadioShack. It now operates as an on-line retailer of electronic components and kits at tandyonline.com.\nIn Australia, Tandy Electronics stores were sold to Woolworths Limited in 2001. After Woolworths purchased Tandy Electronics, despite owning rival Dick Smith Electronics, both continued to trade as separate entities. In February 2009, Woolworths announced that it would be closing all Tandy Electronics stores within the next two years; all Tandy Electronics stores were closed on June 24, 2012.\nIn Canada, the InterTAN stores were sold to rival Circuit City Inc. The stores were branded as RadioShack, however, because Circuit City lost the naming rights. Later, all of these RadioShacks were re-branded as \"The Source by Circuit City\" (now called just The Source). Some of these stores have since closed. In 2009, Circuit City sold The Source to Bell Canada Enterprises (BCE).\nOther retail outlets.\nColor Tile.\nIn 1975, Tandy spun off Color Tile, a chain of tile and flooring stores, along with its other non-electronic businesses in 1975 to TandyCrafts.\nMcDuff Electronics, VideoConcepts.\nIn 1985, Tandy acquired two chains, McDuff Electronics and VideoConcepts; the latter was previously owned by Eckerd Corporation. Most of these stores were closed as part of a 1994 restructuring plan, with 33 converted to RadioShack or Computer City Express stores. Remaining McDuff stores were closed in 1996.\nThe Edge in Electronics.\nThe Edge in Electronics, a now-defunct chain of boutique stores geared toward mall customers interested in fashionable personal and portable name brand electronics, debuted in 1990 and had 16 stores as of December 1993. One of the last stores open closed in San Antonio, Texas, in 2001.\nIncredible Universe.\nThe Incredible Universe concept was Tandy's attempt to compete with other electronics giants such as Best Buy, Circuit City, and Lechmere. A joint venture between Tandy Corporation and Trans World Entertainment, the first two stores, located in Arlington, Texas, and Wilsonville, Oregon, opened in 1992. Each Incredible Universe store stocked more than 85,000 items, and the stores' sales personnel did not work on commission. Sales were below average compared to Tandy's profitable RadioShack line, and by late 1996, the company had decided to sell or close all 17 Incredible Universe stores. Many Incredible Universe stores were acquired by Fry's Electronics.\nComputer City.\nComputer City was a supercenter concept featuring name-brand and private label computers, software and related products; acquired in 1991, these supplanted the original Radio Shack Computer Center chain, which closed that year. Computer City became the first International Computer Superstore with over 100 locations in six countries. In 1995, Computer City was recognized as the 2nd fastest retailer to hit $1 (~$ in 2024) billion in sales. In 1996, it was recognized as the second fastest retailer to hit $2 (~$ in 2024) billion in sales. (Sam's Club was the fastest retailer to hit $1 billion.) Alan Bush, former EVP of RadioShack and Jim Hamilton, known as the \"Father of Computer Retailing,\" were the strategists behind the rapid growth and success. The Computer City stores were later sold to CompUSA.\nO'Sullivan Industries.\nIn 1983, Conroy sold O'Sullivan Industries, a furniture manufacturer, to Tandy Corporation. In 1994, Tandy Corporation offered O'Sullivan as a public company. In 1999, O'Sullivan was purchased for about $350 million (~$ in 2024) by investment group OSI Acquisition, an affiliate of Brockman, Rosser, Sherrill &amp; Co., L.P. (BRS).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Situated on a bay in north Estonia, on the shore of the Gulf of Finland of the Baltic Sea, it has a population of 456,518 as of 2025 and administratively lies in Harju County. Tallinn is the main governmental, financial, industrial, and cultural centre of Estonia. It is located northwest of the country's second largest city, Tartu, however, only south of Helsinki, Finland; it is also west of Saint Petersburg, Russia, north of Riga, Latvia, and east of Stockholm, Sweden. From the 13th century until the first half of the 20th century, Tallinn was known in most of the world by variants of its other historical name Reval.\nTallinn received L\u00fcbeck city rights in 1248; however, the earliest evidence of human settlement in the area dates back nearly 5,000 years. The medieval indigenous population of what is now Tallinn and north Estonia was one of the last \"pagan\" civilisations in Europe to adopt Christianity following the Papal-sanctioned Northern Crusades in the 13th century. The first recorded claim over the place was laid by Denmark after a successful raid in 1219 led by King Valdemar II, followed by a period of alternating Scandinavian and Teutonic rulers. Due to the strategic location by the sea, its port became a significant trade hub, especially in the 14\u201316th centuries, when Tallinn grew in importance as the northernmost member city of the Hanseatic League. Tallinn Old Town is one of the best-preserved medieval cities in Europe and is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nIn 2012, Tallinn had the highest number of startup companies (per capita) among all capitals and larger cities in Europe. Tallinn is the birthplace of many international high-technology companies, including Skype and Wise. The city is home to the headquarters of the European Union's IT agency, and to the NATO Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence.\nIn 2007, Tallinn was listed among the top-10 digital cities in the world, and in 2022, Tallinn was listed among the top-10 \"medium-sized European cities of the future\".\nNames and etymology.\nThe name \"Tallinn\" is Estonian. It has been widely considered a historical derivation of \"Taani-linna\", meaning \"Danish-castle\" (), conceivably because the Danish invaders built the castle in place of the Estonian stronghold after the 1219 battle of Lyndanisse.\nThe Icelandic \"Nj\u00e1l's saga\"\u2014composed after 1270, but describing events between 960 and 1020\u2014mentions an event that occurred somewhere in the area of Tallinn and calls the place \"Rafala\" (probably a derivation of \"Revala\", \"R\u00e4vala\", or some other variant of the Estonian name of the adjacent medieval Estonian county). Soon after the Danish conquest in 1219, the town became known in the Scandinavian and German languages as \"Reval\" (). The etymology of \"Revala\" and derivatives in Estonian is unclear and hypotheses are numerous.\nIn international use, the English and German-language \"Reval\" as well as the Russian analog \"Revel\" () were all gradually replaced by the Estonian name after the country became independent in 1918. At first, both Estonian forms, \"Tallinna\" and \"Tallinn\", were used.\nHenry of Livonia, in his chronicle (c.\u20091229), called the town with the name that is also known to have been used up to the 13th century by Scandinavians: \"Lindanisa\" (or \"Lyndanisse\" in Danish, \"Lindan\u00e4s\" in Swedish and \"Ledenets\" in Old East Slavic).\nIn 1154, a town called (\"Qlwn\" or \"Quwri\") was recorded in the description of the world on the world map (\"Tabula Rogeriana\") commissioned by the Norman King Roger II of Sicily and compiled by Arab cartographer Muhammad al-Idrisi, who described it as \"a small town like a large castle\" among the towns of 'Astlanda'. It has been suggested that one possible transcription, 'Qlwn', may have denoted a predecessor of the modern city and may somehow be related to a toponym \"Kolyvan\", which has been discovered from later East Slavic chronicles. However, a number of historians have considered connecting any of al-Idrisi's placenames with modern Tallinn erroneous, unfounded, or speculative.\nHistory.\nThe first archaeological traces of a small hunter-fisherman community's presence in what is now Tallinn's city centre are c.\u20095,000 years old. The comb ceramic pottery found on the site dates to about 3000 BCE and corded ware pottery to around 2500 BCE.\nAround 1050 AD, a fortress was built in what is now central Tallinn, on the hill of Toompea.\nAs an important port on a major trade route between Novgorod and western Europe, it became a target for the expansion of the Teutonic Knights and the Kingdom of Denmark during the period of Northern Crusades in the beginning of the 13th century when Roman Catholic Christianity was forcibly imposed on the local population. The King Valdemar II of Denmark conquered Tallinn and northern Estonia in 1219.\nTallinn, then known more widely as Reval, was granted L\u00fcbeck town rights by the king of Denmark in 1248. In 1285, Reval became the northernmost member of the Hanseatic League\u00a0\u2013 a mercantile and military alliance of German-dominated cities in Northern Europe. The king of Denmark sold Reval along with other land possessions in northern Estonia to the Teutonic Knights in 1346. Reval was arguably the most significant medieval port in the Gulf of Finland. Reval enjoyed a strategic position at the crossroads of trade between the rest of western Europe and Novgorod and Muscovy in the east. The city, with a population of about 8,000, was very well fortified with city walls and 66 defence towers. The city wall has been described as an outstanding example of German Medieval fortification architecture.\nA weather vane, the figure of an old warrior called Old Thomas, was put on top of the spire of the Tallinn Town Hall in 1530. Old Thomas later became a popular symbol of the city.\nIn the early years of the Protestant Reformation, the city converted to Lutheranism. In 1561, Reval (Tallinn) became a dominion of Sweden.\nDuring the 1700\u20131721 Great Northern War, plague-stricken Tallinn along with Swedish Estonia and Livonia capitulated to Tsardom of Russia (Muscovy) in 1710, but the local self-government institutions (Magistracy of Reval and Estonian Knighthood) retained their cultural and economical autonomy within the Governorate of Estonia of the Russian Empire. The Magistracy of Reval was abolished in 1889. The 19th century brought industrialisation of the city and the port kept its importance.\nOn 24 February 1918, the Estonian Declaration of Independence was proclaimed in Tallinn. It was followed by German occupation until the end of World War I in November 1918, after which Tallinn became the capital of independent Estonia. During World War II, Estonia was first occupied by the Soviet army and annexed to the USSR in the summer of 1940, then occupied by Nazi Germany from 1941 to 1944. During the German occupation Tallinn suffered from many instances of aerial bombing by the Soviet air force. During the most devastating Soviet bombing raid on March 9\u201310, 1944 more than a thousand incendiary bombs were dropped on the city, which caused large-scale fires, as a result of which 757 Nazi invaders died. After the German retreat in September 1944, the city was reoccupied by the Soviet Union.\nDuring the 1980 Summer Olympics, the sailing (then known as yachting) events were held at Pirita, north-east of central Tallinn. Many buildings, such as the Tallinn TV Tower, \"Ol\u00fcmpia\" hotel, the new Main Post Office building, and the Regatta Centre, were built for the Olympics.\nIn 1991, the independent democratic Estonian nation was restored and a period of quick development as a modern European capital ensued. Tallinn became the capital of a \"de facto\" independent country once again on 20 August 1991. The Old Town became a World Heritage Site in 1997, and the city hosted the 2002 Eurovision Song Contest. Tallinn was the 2011 European Capital of Culture, and is the recipient of the 2023 European Green Capital Award. The city has pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030 and takes pride in its biodiversity and high air quality. But critics say that the award was received on false promises since it won the title with its \"15-minute city\" concept, according to which key facilities and services should be accessible within a 15-minute walk or bike ride but the concept was left out of the green capital program and other parts of the 12 million euro program amount to a collection of temporary and one-off projects without any structural and lasting changes.\nGeography.\nTallinn is situated on the southern coast of the Gulf of Finland, in north-western Estonia.\nThe largest lake in Tallinn is Lake \u00dclemiste (), which serves as the main source of the city's drinking water. Lake Harku is the second-largest lake within the borders of Tallinn and its area is . The only significant river in Tallinn nowadays is the Pirita river, in the eponymous Pirita city district. Historically, a smaller river, called H\u00e4rjapea, flowed from Lake \u00dclemiste through the town into the sea, but the river was diverted into underground sewerage system in the 1930s and has since completely disappeared from the cityscape. References to it still remain in the street names J\u00f5e (from \"j\u00f5gi\", river) and Kivisilla (from \"kivi sild\", stone bridge).\nThe length of the seaside coast is , comprising three larger (Kopli, Paljassaare, and Kakum\u00e4e) peninsulas. The city has a number of public beaches, including those at Pirita, Stroomi, Kakum\u00e4e, Harku, and Pikakari.\nThe highest point in Tallinn, at 64 m (about 200\u00a0ft) above sea level, is situated in Hiiu, N\u00f5mme District, in the south-west of the city. A large limestone cliff runs through the city. It can be seen at Toompea, Lasnam\u00e4e, and Astangu. However, the hill at Toompea, despite its prominence, is not geologically connected to the larger limestone cliff formation.\nThe rocks and sediments underneath Tallinn are of different composition and age. Youngest are the Quaternary deposits. The materials of these deposits are till, varved clay, sand, gravel, and pebbles that are of glacial, marine and lacustrine origin. Some of the Quaternary deposits are valuable as they constitute aquifers, or as in the case of gravels and sands, are used as construction materials. The Quaternary deposits are the fill of valleys that are now buried. The buried valleys of Tallinn are carved into older rock likely by ancient rivers to be later modified by glaciers. While the valley fill is made up of Quaternary sediments the valleys themselves originated from erosion that took place before the Quaternary. The substrate into which the buried valleys were carved is made up of hard sedimentary rock of Ediacaran, Cambrian and Ordovician age. Only the upper layer of Ordovician rocks protrudes from the cover of younger deposits, cropping out in the Baltic Klint at the coast and at a few places inland. The Ordovician rocks are made up from top to bottom of a thick layer of limestone and marlstone, then a first layer of argillite followed by first layer of sandstone and siltstone and then another layer of argillite also followed by sandstone and siltstone. In other places of the city, hard sedimentary rock is only to be found beneath Quaternary sediments at depths reaching as much as 120 m below sea level. Underlying the sedimentary rock are the rocks of the Fennoscandian Craton including gneisses and other metamorphic rocks with volcanic rock protoliths and rapakivi granites. These rocks are much older than the rest (Paleoproterozoic age) and do not crop out anywhere in Estonia.\nClimate.\nTallinn has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"Dfb\") with warm, rainy summers and cold, snowy winters.\nWinters are cold, but mild for its latitude, owing to its coastal location. The average temperature in February, the coldest month, is .

Tallinn has an average windspeed of with winters being the windiest (around in January) and summers being the least windy at around in August. In Tallinn airport, winds blow predominantly from the southwest, south, and west.\nThe city's climate, along with Riga and Helsinki, has been characterized as unpredictable.\nTemperature extremes range from on 31 December 1978 to on 30 July 1994.\nAdministrative districts.\nTallinn is subdivided into eight administrative \"linnaosa\" (districts). Each district has a \"linnaosa valitsus\" (district government) which is managed by a \"linnaosavanem\" (district elder) who is appointed by the city government. The function of the \"district governments\", however, is not directly governing, but just limited to providing advice to the city government and the city council on issues related to the administration of respective districts.\nThe districts are administratively further divided into 84 \"asum\" (subdistricts or \"neighbourhoods\" with officially defined borders).\nGovernment.\nThe city is governed by the Tallinn City Council which consists of 79 members elected to four year terms via party list. The mayor is elected by the city council.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe population of Tallinn as of 1 January 2025 is 456,518.

As of 2022, ethnic Estonians made up over 53% of the population. Tallinn was one of the urban areas with industrial and military significance in northern Estonia that during the period of Soviet occupation underwent extensive changes in its ethnic composition due to large influx of immigrants from Russia and other parts of the former USSR. Whole new city districts were built where the main intent of the then Soviet authorities was to accommodate Russian-speaking immigrants: Mustam\u00e4e, V\u00e4ike-\u00d5ism\u00e4e, Pelguranna, and most notably, Lasnam\u00e4e, which in 1980s became, and is to this day, the most populous district of Tallinn.\nThe official language of Tallinn is Estonian. As of 2011, 50.1% of the city's residents were native speakers of Estonian, whereas 46.7% had Russian as their first language. While English is the most frequently used foreign language by the residents of Tallinn, there are also a significant number of native speakers of Ukrainian and Finnish.\nReligion.\nThe pie chart to the right shows the distribution of religion in Tallinn as of 2021.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEconomy.\nTallinn has a highly diversified economy with particular strengths in information technology, tourism and logistics. More than half of Estonia's GDP is created in Tallinn. In 2008, the GDP per capita of Tallinn stood at 172% of the Estonian average.\nIn addition to longtime functions as seaport and capital city, Tallinn has seen development of an information technology sector; in its 13 December 2005, edition, \"The New York Times\" characterised Estonia as \"a sort of Silicon Valley on the Baltic Sea\". One of Tallinn's sister cities is the Silicon Valley town of Los Gatos, California. Skype is one of the best-known of several Estonian start-ups originating from Tallinn. Many start-ups have originated from the Institute of Cybernetics. In recent years, Tallinn has gradually been becoming one of the main IT centres of Europe, with the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD COE) of NATO, eu-LISA, the EU Digital Agency and the IT development centres of large corporations, such as TeliaSonera and Kuehne + Nagel being based in the city.\nTallinn receives 4.3\u00a0million visitors annually, a figure that has grown steadily over the past decade. The Finns are especially a common sight in Tallinn; on average, about 20,000\u201340,000 Finnish tourists visit the city between June and October. Most of the visitors come from Europe, though Tallinn has also become increasingly visited by tourists from the Asia-Pacific region.\nTallinn Passenger Port is one of the busiest cruise destinations on the Baltic Sea, it served more than 520,000 cruise passengers in 2013.\nThe state-owned energy company Eesti Energia, the nationwide electric power transmission system operator Elering, the natural gas distributor Eesti Gaas, and the country's largest private energy company, Alexela Group, all have their headquarters in Tallinn.\nTallinn is the financial centre of Estonia and also an important economic centre in the Baltoscandian region. Many major banks, such as SEB, Swedbank, and Nordea, have their local offices in Tallinn. LHV Pank, an Estonian investment bank, has its corporate headquarters in Tallinn. Tallinn Stock Exchange, part of NASDAQ OMX Group, is the only regulated exchange in Estonia.\nPort of Tallinn is one of the biggest ports in the Baltic sea region, whereas the largest cargo port of Estonia, the Port of Muuga, which is operated by the same business entity, is located in the neighboring town of Maardu. Old City Harbour has been known as a convenient harbour since the medieval times, but nowadays the cargo operations are shifted to Muuga Cargo Port and Paldiski South Harbour. As of 2010, there was still a small fleet of oceangoing trawlers that operated out of Tallinn.\nTallinn's industries include shipbuilding, machine building, metal processing, electronics, textile manufacturing. BLRT Grupp has its headquarters and some subsidiaries in Tallinn. Air Maintenance Estonia and AS Panaviatic Maintenance, both based in Tallinn Airport, provide MRO services for aircraft, largely expanding their operations in recent years. \nLiviko, the maker of the internationally known Vana Tallinn liqueur, is similarly based in Tallinn. The headquarters of Kalev, a confectionery company and part of the industrial conglomerate Orkla Group, is located in Lehmja, near the city's southeastern boundary.\nEstonia is ranked third in Europe in terms of shopping centre space per inhabitant, ahead of Sweden and being surpassed only by Norway and Luxembourg.\nEducation.\nInstitutions of higher education and science include:\nCulture.\nTallinn was a European Capital of Culture for 2011, along with Turku, Finland.\nMuseums.\n Tallinn is home to more than 60 museums and galleries. Most of them are located in Kesklinn, the central district of the city, and cover Tallinn's rich history.\nOne of the most visited historical museums in Tallinn is the Estonian History Museum, located in Great Guild Hall at Vanalinn, the old part of the city. It covers Estonia's history from prehistoric times up until the end of the 20th century. It features film and hands-on displays that show how Estonian dwellers lived and survived.\nThe Estonian Maritime Museum provides an overview of the nation's seafaring past. The museum is located in the Old Town, inside one of Tallinn's former defensive structures \u2013 Fat Margaret's Tower. Another historical museum that can be found at city's Old Town, just behind the Town Hall, is Tallinn City Museum. It covers Tallinn's history from pre-history until 1991, when Estonia regained its independence. Tallinn City Museum owns nine more departments and museums around the city, one of which is Tallinn's Museum of Photography, also located just behind the Town Hall. It features a permanent exhibition that covers 100 years of photography in Estonia.\nEstonia's Vabamu Museum of Occupations and Freedom is located in Kesklinn (the Central district). It covers the 51 years (1940\u20131991) when Estonia was occupied by the former Soviet Union and Nazi Germany.

It features equipment, uniforms, and documents of Russian Secret Service agents.\nThe city is also home to Estonian Museum of Natural History and the Estonian Health Museum, both located in Old Town. The Museum of Natural History features several themed exhibitions that provide an overview of the wildlife of Estonia and the world. The Estonian Health Museum has exhibitions covering human anatomy, health care, and the history of medicine in Estonia on display.\nTallinn is home to several art and design museums. The Estonian Art Museum, the largest art museum in Estonia, consists of four branches \u2013 Kumu Art Museum, Kadriorg Art Museum, Mikkel Museum, and Niguliste Museum. Kumu Art Museum features the country's largest collection of contemporary and modern art. It also displays Estonian art starting from the early 18th century. Those who are interested in Western European and Russian art may enjoy Kadriorg Art Museum collections, located in Kadriorg Palace, a beautiful Baroque building erected by Peter the Great. It stores and displays about 9,000 works of art from the 16th to 20th centuries.

Numerous caf\u00e9s have played a major role in a social life of the city since the 19th century, as have bars, especially in the Kesklinn district.\nThe \"martsipan\" industry in Tallinn has a very long history. The production of \"martsipan\" started in the Middle Ages, almost simultaneously in Tallinn (Reval) and L\u00fcbeck, both member cities of the Hanseatic League. In 1695, \"marzipan\" was mentioned as a medicine, under the designation of \"Panis Martius,\" in the price lists of the Tallinn Town Hall Pharmacy. The modern era of \"martsipan\" in Tallinn began in 1806, when the Swiss confectioner Lorenz Caviezel set up his confectionery on Pikk Street. In 1864, it was bought and expanded by Georg Stude and now is known as the Maiasmokk caf\u00e9. In the late 19th century \"martsipan\" figurines made by Tallinn's confectioners were supplied to the Russian imperial family.\nArguably, the most symbolic seafood dish of Tallinn is \"v\u00fcrtsikilu\" (\"spicy sprat\") \u2013 salted sprats pickled with a distinctive set of spices including black pepper, allspice and cloves. The making of traditional \"v\u00fcrtsikilu\" is thought to have originated from the city's outskirts. In 1826, the merchants of Tallinn exported 40,000 cans of \"v\u00fcrtsikilu\" to Saint Petersburg. A closely associated dish is \"kiluv\u00f5ileib\" (\"sprat-butter-bread\") \u2013 a traditional rye bread open sandwich covered with a layer of butter and \"v\u00fcrtsikilu\" as the topping. Boiled egg slices and culinary herbs are optional extra toppings. Alcoholic beverages produced in the city include beer, vodka, and liqueurs (such as the eponymous Vana Tallinn). The number of craft beer breweries has expanded sharply in Tallinn over the last decade, entering local and regional markets.\nTourism.\nTallinn's main tourist attractions are located in the Tallinn Old Town (divided into a \"lower town\" and Toompea hill) which is easily explored on foot. The eastern parts of the city, notably Pirita (with Pirita Convent) and Kadriorg (with Kadriorg Palace) districts, are also popular destinations, and the Estonian Open Air Museum in Rocca al Mare, west of the city, preserves aspects of Estonian rural culture and architecture. The historical wooded suburbs like Kalamaja, Pelgulinn, Kassisaba and Kelmik\u00fcla and revitalized industrial areas like Rotermanni Quarter, Noblessner and Dvigatel are also unique places to visit.\nToompea\u00a0\u2013 Upper Town.\nThis area was once an almost separate town, heavily fortified, and has always been the seat of governing power in Estonia. The hill occupies an easily defensible site overlooking the surrounding districts. The major attractions are the medieval Toompea Castle (today housing the Estonian Parliament, the \"Riigikogu\"), the Lutheran St Mary's Cathedral, also known as the Dome Church (), and the Russian Orthodox Alexander Nevsky Cathedral.\nAll-linn\u00a0\u2013 Lower Town.\nThis area is one of the best preserved medieval towns in Europe and the authorities are continuing its rehabilitation. Major sights include the Town Hall square (), the city wall and towers (notably \"Fat Margaret\" and \"Kiek in de K\u00f6k\") as well as a number of medieval churches, including St Olaf's, St. Nicholas' and the Church of the Holy Ghost. The Catholic Cathedral of St Peter and St Paul is also in the Lower Town.\nKadriorg.\nKadriorg is east of the city centre and is served by buses and trams. Kadriorg Palace, the former palace of Peter the Great, built just after the Great Northern War, now houses the foreign art department of the Art Museum of Estonia, the presidential residence and the surrounding grounds include formal gardens and woodland.\nThe main building of the Art Museum of Estonia, Kumu (, Art Museum), was built in 2006 and lies in Kadriorg park. It houses an encyclopaedic collection of Estonian art, including paintings by Carl Timoleon von Neff, Johann K\u00f6ler, Eduard Ole, Jaan Koort, Konrad M\u00e4gi, Eduard Wiiralt, Henn Roode and Adamson-Eric, among others.\nPirita.\nThis coastal district is a further 2 kilometres north-east of Kadriorg. The marina was built for the Moscow Olympics of 1980, and boats can be hired on the Pirita River. Two kilometres inland are the Botanic Gardens and the Tallinn TV Tower.\nTransport.\nCity transport.\nThe city operates a system of bus (73 lines), tram (5 lines) and trolley-bus (4 lines) routes to all districts; the long tram system is the only tram network in Estonia. A flat-fare system is used. The ticket-system is based on prepaid RFID cards available in kiosks and post offices. In January 2013, Tallinn became the first European capital to offer a fare-free service on buses, trams and trolleybuses within the city limits. This service is available to residents who register with the municipality.\nTallinn offers a wide range of smart mobility options, with extensive free-floating fleets of e-scooters, e-bikes, bikes, and cars available for rent throughout the city.\nAir.\nThe Lennart Meri Tallinn Airport is about from Town Hall square (). There is a tram (Line Number: 4) and local bus connection between the airport and the edge of the city centre (bus no. 2). The nearest railway station \u00dclemiste is only from the airport. The construction of the new section of the airport began in 2007 and was finished in summer 2008.\nFerry.\nSeveral ferry operators, including Viking Line, Tallink and Ecker\u00f6 Line, connect Tallinn to Helsinki, Mariehamn, Stockholm, and St. Petersburg. Passenger lines connect Tallinn to Helsinki ( north of Tallinn) in approximately 2\u20133.5 hours by cruiseferries, with up to eight daily crossings all year round.\nRailroad.\nThe Elron railway company operates train services from Tallinn to Tartu, Valga, T\u00fcri, Viljandi, Tapa, Narva, Koidula. Buses are also available to all these and various other destinations in Estonia, as well as to Saint Petersburg in Russia and Riga, Latvia. The Russian railways company operated a daily international sleeper train service between Tallinn \u2013 Moscow, and was stopped in 2020.\nTallinn also has a commuter rail service running from Tallinn's main rail station in two main directions: east (Aegviidu) and to several western destinations (P\u00e4\u00e4sk\u00fcla, Keila, Riisipere, Turba, Paldiski, and Kloogaranna).

Written in the mid-1960s by the folk musician Roy Williamson, its lyrics describe the victory of Robert the Bruce, King of Scots, over Edward II, King of England, at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. Owing to its historical basis in the Wars of Scottish Independence, it urges contemporary Scots to rise again as an independent nation and remember the day their ancestors deterred Edward's English invaders. \nNotable for its association with supporters of the Scottish national football team and Scottish national rugby union team, \"Flower of Scotland\" is one of the most popular sporting anthems in Europe.\nBackground.\nIt was composed in the mid-1960s by Roy Williamson of the folk group the Corries. It was first heard publicly in a BBC television series in 1967, where it did not yet include the third 'we can still rise now' verse. The words refer to the victory of the Kingdom of Scotland, led by Robert I, over Edward II of the Kingdom of England at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. Although there is no official national anthem of Scotland, \"Flower of Scotland\" is one of a number of songs which are used, along with the older \"Scotland the Brave\".\nThe song was composed and is sung in English, with one Scots-language word (\"Tae\" for \"To\"). It has been translated into Scots.\nPopular use.\nSporting events.\nThe song has been used as an anthem by the Scotland rugby union team, ever since the winger, Billy Steele, encouraged his team-mates to sing it on the British Lions tour of South Africa in 1974. The song was adopted as the pre-game anthem for the 1990 Five Nations Championship, first non-officially for the initial home game against France, then for the deciding match between Scotland and England at Murrayfield, which Scotland won 13\u20137 to win the Grand Slam. \nThe Scottish Football Association adopted \"Flower of Scotland\" as its pre-game national anthem in 1997 although it was first used by them in 1993.\nCommonwealth Games.\nThe song was used as the victory anthem of Team Scotland at the Commonwealth Games in 2010, replacing \"Scotland the Brave\". This trend continued to the Commonwealth Games in 2014 where it was again Team Scotland's anthem and was sung following a Scottish gold medal. It was sung four times when Team Scotland won four gold medals on the first day of competition.\nOlympics.\nAt the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, the song was sung at Edinburgh Castle by 53 Scottish children selected from schools across Scotland.\nOfficial anthem.\nIn July 2006 the Royal Scottish National Orchestra conducted an online poll (publicised by \"Reporting Scotland\") in which voters could choose a national anthem from one of five candidates. There were 10,000 respondents, and \"Flower of Scotland\" won with 41 per cent of the votes.\nOn 13 January 2015 the Scottish Parliament heard evidence from a member of the public, Chris Cromar, who had brought forward a petition for consideration on an agreed national anthem for Scotland. Cromar had, through the petition, called for the Scottish Government to formally recognise and adopt \"Flower of Scotland\" as the Scottish national anthem. \nThe Scottish Football Association (SFA) responded to a written request from the Scottish Parliament regarding the petition, whereby they stated that they believed the matter of agreeing a national anthem for Scotland would be \"more appropriate for the 35,000 members of the Scotland Supporter's Club members\". The SFA conducted a poll amongst its members and audiences on its social media platforms, with \"Flower of Scotland\" achieving a narrow victory. Despite this, the SFA alluded to the matter that the narrowing victory suggested \"some food for thought\" over what the national anthem should be, with \"Scotland the Brave\" retaining an affinity amongst Scotland's football supporters. \nOn 17 March 2015 the Scottish Parliament officially closed the consideration of the petition under Rule 15.7, claiming that \"this is not something that should be led by the Scottish Government but is likely to be determined informally over time\". Angus MacDonald said in a speech to the Scottish Parliament about the petition that \"given the position of the Scottish Government, and given that there is still a considerable amount of debate outside as to what the national anthem should be, we should close the petition reluctantly and allow that debate to continue\".\nOther uses.\nParis Saint-Germain fans sing the chant \"\u00d4 Ville Lumi\u00e8re\" (\"O City of Light\") to the tune of \"Flower of Scotland\". The song was featured on the 1983 album 'A Sense of Freedom' by the Wolfe Tones.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31584", "revid": "50345439", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31584", "title": "Lord of the Flies", "text": "1954 novel by William Golding\nLord of the Flies is the 1954 debut novel of British author William Golding. The plot concerns a group of prepubescent British boys who are stranded on an uninhabited island and their disastrous attempts to govern themselves that led to a descent into savagery. The novel's themes include morality, leadership, and the tension between civility and chaos.\n\"Lord of the Flies\" was generally well received and is a popularly assigned book in schools.\nBackground.\nPublished in 1954, \"Lord of the Flies\" was Golding's first novel. Golding got the idea for the plot from \"The Coral Island\", a children's adventure novel with a focus on Christianity and the supposed civilising influence of British colonialism. Golding thought that the book was unrealistic and asked his wife whether it would be a good idea if he \"wrote a book about children on an island, children who behave in the way children really would behave?\"\nGolding, who was a philosophy teacher before becoming a Royal Navy lieutenant, experienced war firsthand and commanded a landing craft in the Normandy landings during D-Day in 1944. After the war ended and Golding returned to England, the world was dominated by Cold War and the threat of nuclear annihilation, which led Golding to examine the nature of humanity and that went on to inspire \"Lord of the Flies\".\nThe draft of the book was entitled \"Strangers from Within\", which was considered \"too abstract and too explicit\". The novel was rejected by many publishers before being accepted by Faber &amp; Faber. An initial rejection labelled the book as \"absurd... Rubbish &amp; dull\". Eventually Golding chose \"Lord of the Flies\" as the title. The title is a literal translation of Beelzebub, a biblical demon considered the god of pride and warfare.\nEditor Charles Monteith worked with Golding on several major edits, including removing the entire first section that described an evacuation from nuclear war. The character of Simon also was heavily edited to remove an interaction with a mysterious figure who is implied to be a god. Ultimately, Golding accepted the edits, and wrote that \"I've lost any kind of objectivity I ever had over this novel and can hardly bear to look at it\". The edited manuscripts are available to view at the University of Exeter library.\nPlot.\nIn the midst of a wartime evacuation, a British aeroplane crashes on an isolated island. The only survivors are boys in their middle childhood or preadolescence. A fair-haired boy named Ralph and a fat boy nicknamed Piggy find a conch shell, which Ralph uses as a horn to gather the survivors. Ralph immediately commands authority over the other surviving boys using the conch, and is elected their \"chief\". He establishes three goals for the boys: to have fun, to survive, and to constantly maintain a smoke signal that could alert passing ships. Ralph, a red-haired boy named Jack, and a quiet boy named Simon use Piggy's glasses to create a signal fire.\nThe semblance of order among them deteriorates as the boys grow lazy and ignore Ralph's efforts to improve life on the island. They become paranoid about an imaginary monster called \"the beast\". Ralph fails to convince the boys that no beast exists, while Jack gains popularity by declaring that he will personally hunt and kill the monster. At one point, Jack takes the boys to hunt a wild pig, including the boys who were meant to watch the signal fire. The smoke signal goes out, failing to attract a ship that was passing by the island. Ralph angrily confronts Jack and considers relinquishing his role as leader, but is persuaded not to do so by Piggy. \nOne night, an air battle occurs near the island and the body of a fighter pilot drifts down in a parachute. Twin boys Sam and Eric mistake the corpse for the beast. When Ralph and Jack investigate with another boy, Roger, they flee in terror, believing the imaginary beast is real. Jack tries to turn the others against Ralph, and goes off alone to form his own tribe, with most of the other boys gradually joining him. Jack and his followers set up an offering to the beast in the forest: a pig's head, mounted on a sharpened stick and swarming with flies. Simon, who often ventures into the forest alone, has an imaginary dialogue with the head that he dubs the \"Lord of the Flies\". The head tells Simon that there is no beast on the island, implies that the beast is actually within the \"boys\" themselves and predicts that the others will turn on Simon. That night, Ralph and Piggy visit Jack's tribe, who have begun painting their faces and engaging in primitive ritual dances. When Simon realises that the beast is only a dead pilot, he rushes to tell Jack's tribe, but the frenzied boys (including Ralph and Piggy) mistake Simon for the beast and kill him.\nJack and his tribe steal Piggy's glasses, the only means of starting a fire. Ralph goes to Jack's camp with Piggy, Sam, and Eric to confront Jack and retrieve the glasses. Cementing his rebellious spirit against Ralph's authority, Roger drops a boulder that kills Piggy and shatters the conch in the process. Ralph manages to escape, but Sam and Eric are forced to join Jack's tribe. That night, Ralph secretly confronts Sam and Eric, who warn him that Jack plans to hunt for him. \nThe next morning, Jack's tribe sets fire to the forest. Ralph narrowly escapes the boys and the fire, and while fleeing, falls down in front of a uniformed adult \u2013 a British naval officer who has landed on the island to investigate the fire. Ralph, Jack, and the remaining boys erupt into sobs over the \"end of innocence\". The officer then expresses his disappointment at seeing the boys exhibiting such feral, warlike behavior, then turns, \"moved and a little embarrassed\", to stare at his cruiser waiting offshore.\nThemes.\nThe novel's major themes are morality, civility, leadership, and the potential for rapid degeneration into chaos in society that all explore the duality of human nature. \n\"Lord of the Flies\" portrays a scenario in which upper-class British children quickly descend into chaos and violence without adult authority, despite attempts by some of them to establish order and co-ordination. This subverts the colonial narration found in many British books of this period; for example, \"The Coral Island\". \"Lord of the Flies\" contains various references to \"The Coral Island\"; for example, the rescuing naval officer describing the misadventures of the boys as a \"jolly good show. Like the Coral Island.\" Golding's three central characters, Ralph, Piggy, and Jack, can also be interpreted as caricatures of the protagonists in \"The Coral Island\".\nAt an allegorical level, a central theme is how the desire for civilisation conflicts with the desire for power. \"Lord of the Flies\" also portrays the tension between groupthink and individuality, between rational and emotional reactions, and between morality and immorality. These themes have been explored in an essay by American literary critic Harold Bloom.\nSome examples of symbolism in \"Lord of the Flies\" are the signal fire, Piggy's glasses, and the conch shell, which may be read as representing hope, reason, democracy, and unity, among other interpretations.\nThe novel also examines aspects of war, as the story is set during a war that has begun before the boys arrive on the island. Although the location of the island is never stated, it is sometimes thought to be somewhere in the Pacific Ocean, but John Sutherland argues that a coral island in the Indian Ocean is intended, based on remarks by Jack that the plane had stopped off in \"Gib\" (Gibraltar) and \"Addis\" (Addis Ababa), presumably en route to a refuge in Western Australia. In fact, an early manuscript, entitled \"Strangers From Within\", explicitly placed the island near New Guinea and Borneo.\nGenre and style.\nAs a tale of adventure and survival, \"Lord of the Flies\" fits the genre of Allegorical fiction. It also questions human morality, making it a work of philosophical fiction. The novel is styled as allegorical fiction, embodying the concepts of inherent human savagery, mob mentality, and totalitarian leadership. However, Golding deviates from typical allegory in that both the protagonists and the antagonists are fully developed, realistic characters.\nReception.\nCritical response.\nIts first print run of 3,000 copies was slow to sell, but \"Lord of the Flies\" went on to become very popular, with more than ten million copies sold as of 2015. E. M. Forster chose \"Lord of the Flies\" as his \"outstanding novel of the year\". It was described in one review as \"not only a first-rate adventure but a parable of our times\". In February 1960, Floyd C. Gale of \"Galaxy Science Fiction\" rated \"Lord of the Flies\" five stars out of five, stating, \"Golding paints a truly terrifying picture of the decay of a minuscule society... Well on its way to becoming a modern classic\". \nMarc D. Hauser called \"Lord of the Flies\" \"riveting\" and said that it \"should be standard reading in biology, economics, psychology, and philosophy\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Lord of the Flies\" presents a view of humanity unimaginable before the horrors of Nazi Europe, and then plunges into speculations about mankind in the state of nature. Bleak and specific, but universal, fusing rage and grief, \"Lord of the Flies\" is both a novel of the 1950s, and for all time.\n\u2014Robert McCrum, \"The Guardian\".\n\"Lord of the Flies\" was included on the American Library Association list of the 100 most frequently challenged books of 1990\u20131999, for its controversial stance on human nature and individual welfare versus the common good. \nThe book has been criticised as cynical for portraying humanity as inherently selfish and violent. It has been linked with the essay \"The Tragedy of the Commons\" by Garrett Hardin and with books by Ayn Rand and countered by \"Management of the Commons\" by Elinor Ostrom. \n\"Lord of the Flies\" has been contrasted with the historical Tongan castaways incident from 1965, when a group of schoolboys on a fishing boat from Tonga were marooned on an uninhabited island and considered dead by their relatives. The group not only managed to survive for more than 15 months, but they \"had set up a small commune with food garden, hollowed-out tree trunks to store rainwater, a gymnasium with curious weights, a badminton court, chicken pens, and a permanent fire, all from handiwork, an old knife blade, and much determination\" according to reports. When the Tongan boys were found by a ship captain, Peter Warner, they were in good health and spirits and had developed an orderly adaptation to their stranding. When writing about the Tongan event, the Dutch historian, Rutger Bregman, said that comparing the incident to Golding's fictional portrayal made him consider the \"Lord of the Flies\" as unrealistic.\nIn a 2025 \"PopMatters\" reappraisal, cultural critic Charles Switzer stated, \"That\u2019s why \"Lord of the Flies\" still resonates. In an age when young people face constant pressure to conform, perform, and pick sides \u2014 whether online or in real-world social hierarchies \u2014 the breakdown on Golding\u2019s Island feels painfully familiar. The fear of being cast out, the seduction of belonging at any cost, the ease with which violence becomes a form of power \u2014 these aren\u2019t relics of colonial history. They\u2019re part of the emotional architecture that today\u2019s young people still must navigate.\"\nAwards.\n\"Lord of the Flies\" was awarded a place on both lists of Modern Library 100 Best Novels, reaching number 41 on the editor's list and 25 on the reader's list. In 2003, \"Lord of the Flies\" was listed at number 70 on the BBC survey, The Big Read, and in 2005, it was chosen by \"Time\" magazine as one of the 100 best English-language novels since 1923. \"Time\" also included the novel in its list of the 100 Best Young-Adult Books of All Time.\nPopular in schools, especially in the English-speaking world, a 2016 UK poll saw \"Lord of the Flies\" ranked third in the nation's favourite books from school, behind George Orwell's \"Animal Farm\" and Charles Dickens' \"Great Expectations\".\nIn 2019, BBC News included \"Lord of the Flies\" on its list of the 100 most inspiring novels.\nIn other media.\nFilm and television.\nThree film adaptations were based on the book:\nA fourth adaptation, to feature an all-female cast, was announced by Warner Bros. in August 2017. Subsequently abandoned, it inspired the 2021 television series \"Yellowjackets\". \"Ladyworld\", an all-female adaptation, was released in 2018.\nIn April 2023, the BBC announced that the British production company Eleven Film would produce the first ever television adaptation of the novel, written by screenwriter Jack Thorne.\nStage.\nThe book was first adapted for the stage and performed in 1984 at Clifton College Preparatory School. It was adapted by Elliot Watkins, a teacher at the school, with the personal consent of Golding (the only stage production so endorsed, as he was dead by the time it was adapted again), who attended the opening night.\nNigel Williams wrote his own adaptation of the text for the stage some ten years later. It was debuted by the Royal Shakespeare Company in July 1995. The Pilot Theatre Company toured it extensively in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.\nIn October 2014 it was announced that the 2011 production of \"Lord of the Flies\" would return for the 2015 season at the Regent's Park Open Air Theatre ahead of a major UK tour. The production was to be directed by Timothy Sheader.\nKansas-based Orange Mouse Theatricals and Mathew Klickstein produced a topical, gender-bending adaptation called \"Ladies of the Fly\" that was co-written by a group of girls aged 8 to 16 based on the original text and their own lives. The production was performed by the girls as an immersive live-action show in August 2016.\nRadio.\nIn June 2013, BBC Radio 4 Extra broadcast a dramatisation by Judith Adams in four 30-minute episodes directed by Sasha Yevtushenko. The cast included Ruth Wilson as narrator, Finn Bennett as Ralph, Richard Linnel as Jack, Caspar Hilton-Hilley as Piggy, and Jack Caine as Simon.\nGraphic novel.\nA graphic novel based on the book, adapted, and illustrated by Aim\u00e9e de Jongh, was published on 12 September 2024 in 35 countries. The Dutch version of the book was sold out in a day.\nInfluences.\nLiterature.\nAuthor Stephen King named his fictional town of Castle Rock after Jack's mountain camp in \"Lord of the Flies\". The book itself appears prominently in King's novels \"Cujo\" (1981), \"Misery\" (1987), and \"Hearts in Atlantis\" (1999). His novel \"It\" was influenced by Golding's novel: \"I thought to myself I'd really like to write a story about what's gained and what's lost when you go from childhood to adulthood, and also, the things we experience in childhood that are like seeds that blossom later on.\" In 2011, King wrote an introduction for a new edition of \"Lord of the Flies\" to mark the centenary of Golding's birth. King's town of Castle Rock inspired the name of Rob Reiner's production company, Castle Rock Entertainment.\nAlan Garner credits the book with making him want to become a writer.\nMusic.\nIron Maiden wrote a song inspired by the book, included in their 1995 album \"The X Factor\".\nThe Camerawalls include a song entitled \"Lord of the Flies\" on their 2008 album \"Pocket Guide to the Otherworld\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "31586", "revid": "48716110", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31586", "title": "Ty Cobb", "text": "American baseball player (1886\u20131961)\nTyrus Raymond Cobb (December 18, 1886 \u2013 July 17, 1961), nicknamed \"the Georgia Peach\", was an American professional baseball center fielder. A native of rural Narrows, Georgia, Cobb played 24 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). He spent 22 years with the Detroit Tigers and served as the team's player-manager for the last six, and he finished his career with the Philadelphia Athletics. In 1936, Cobb received the most votes of any player on the inaugural ballot for the National Baseball Hall of Fame, receiving 222 out of a possible 226 votes (98.2%); no other player received a higher percentage of votes until Tom Seaver in 1992. In 1999, the \"Sporting News\" ranked Cobb third on its list of \"Baseball's 100 Greatest Players.\"\nCobb is credited with setting 90 MLB records throughout his career. Cobb has won more batting titles than any other player, with 11 (or 12, depending on who is awarded the 1910 title). During his 24-year career, he hit .300 in a record 23 consecutive seasons, with the exception being his rookie season. He also hit .400 in three different seasons, a record he shares with three other players. Cobb has more five-hit games (14) than any other player in major league history. He also holds the career record for stealing home (54 times) and for stealing second base, third base, and home in succession (4 times), and is still the youngest player to compile 4,000 hits and score 2,000 runs. His combined total of 4,065 runs scored and runs batted in (after adjusting for home runs) is still the highest ever produced by any major league player. Cobb also ranks first in games played by an outfielder in major league history (2,934). He retained many other records for almost a half century or more, including most career games played (3,035) and at bats (11,429 or 11,434 depending on source) until 1974 as well as the modern record for most career stolen bases (892) until 1977. He also had the most career hits until 1985 (4,189 or 4,191, depending on source) and most career runs until 2001. His .366 or .367 (depending on source) career batting average ranked as the highest-ever recorded up until 2024, when MLB decided to include Negro Leagues players in official statistics.\nCobb's reputation, which includes a large college scholarship fund for Georgia residents financed by his early investments in Coca-Cola and General Motors, has been somewhat tarnished by allegations of racism and violence. These primarily stem from a couple of mostly discredited biographies that were released following his death. Cobb's reputation as a violent man was exaggerated by his first biographer, sportswriter Al Stump, whose stories about Cobb have been proven as sensationalized and largely fictional. While he was known for often violent conflicts, he spoke favorably about black players joining the Major Leagues and was a well-known philanthropist.\nEarly life.\nTyrus Raymond Cobb was born on December 18, 1886, in Narrows, Georgia, a small, unincorporated rural community of farmers. He was the first of three children born to William Herschel Cobb (1863\u20131905) and Amanda Chitwood Cobb (1871\u20131936). Cobb's father was a state senator.\nWhen he was still an infant, his parents moved to the nearby town of Royston, where he grew up. By most accounts, he became fascinated with baseball as a child, and decided that he wanted to go professional one day; his father was vehemently opposed to this idea, but by his teenage years, he was trying out for area teams. He played his first years in organized baseball for the Royston Rompers, the semi-pro Royston Reds, and the Augusta Tourists of the South Atlantic League, who released him after only two days. He then tried out for the Anniston, Alabama-based Anniston Steelers of the semipro Tennessee\u2013Alabama League, with his father's stern admonition ringing in his ears: \"Don't come home a failure!\" After joining the Steelers for a monthly salary of $50, Cobb promoted himself by sending several postcards written about his talents under different aliases to Grantland Rice, the \"Atlanta Journal\" sports editor. Eventually, Rice wrote a small note in the \"Journal\" that a \"young fellow named Cobb seems to be showing an unusual lot of talent.\" After about three months, Cobb returned to the Tourists and finished the season hitting .237 in 35 games. While with the Tourists he was mentored and coached by George Leidy, who emphasized pinpoint bunting and aggression on the basepaths. In August 1905, the management of the Tourists sold Cobb to the American League's Detroit Tigers for $750 ().\nOn August 8, 1905, Cobb's mother, Amanda, fatally shot his father, William, with a pistol that William had purchased for her. Court records indicate that William Cobb had suspected Amanda of infidelity and was sneaking past his own bedroom window to catch her in the act. She saw the silhouette of what she presumed to be an intruder and, acting in self-defense, shot and killed her husband. Amanda Cobb was charged with murder and released on a $7,000 recognizance bond. She was acquitted on March 31, 1906. Ty Cobb later attributed his ferocious play to his late father, saying, \"I did it for my father. He never got to see me play ... but I knew he was watching me, and I never let him down.\"\nCobb was initiated into Freemasonry in 1907, and he was a member of the Scottish Rite and completed the 32nd degree in 1912.\nIn 1911, Cobb moved to Detroit's architecturally significant and now historically protected Woodbridge neighborhood, from which he would walk with his dogs to the ballpark prior to games. The Victorian duplex in which Cobb lived still stands.\nProfessional career.\nDetroit Tigers (1905\u20131926).\nEarly years.\nThree weeks after his mother killed his father, Cobb debuted in center field for the Detroit Tigers. On August 30, 1905, in his first major league at bat, he doubled off Jack Chesbro of the New York Highlanders. Chesbro had won 41 games the previous season. Cobb was 18 years old at the time, the youngest player in the league by almost a year. Although he hit only .240 in 41 games, he signed a $1,500 contract to play for the Tigers in 1906.\nAs a rookie, Cobb was subject to severe hazing by his veteran teammates, who were jealous of the young prospect. The players smashed his homemade bats, nailed his cleats in the clubhouse, doused his clothes before tying knots in them, and verbally abused him. Cobb later attributed his hostile temperament to this experience: \"These old-timers turned me into a snarling wildcat.\" Tigers manager Hughie Jennings, who took the helm in 1907, later acknowledged that Cobb was targeted for abuse by veteran players, some of whom sought to force him off the team. \"I let this go for a while because I wanted to satisfy myself that Cobb has as much guts as I thought in the very beginning,\" Jennings recalled. \"Well, he proved it to me, and I told the other players to let him alone. He is going to be a great baseball player and I won't allow him to be driven off this club.\"\nWithin a year, Cobb emerged as the Tigers' regular center fielder and hit .316 in 98 games in 1906, setting a record for the highest batting average (minimum 310 plate appearances) for a 19-year-old (later bested by Mel Ott's .322 average in 124 games for the 1928 New York Giants). He never hit below that mark again. After being moved to right field, he would lead the Tigers to three consecutive American League pennants in 1907, 1908 and 1909. Detroit would lose each World Series (to the Cubs twice and then the Pirates), however, and Cobb's postseason numbers were in sum notably below his career standard. It was his later contention that his youth at the time played a factor in this. In his remaining nineteen seasons, Cobb did not get another opportunity to play on a pennant-winner and thus in a World Series.\nIn a game in 1907, Cobb reached first and then stole second, third and home. a feat he accomplished four times during his career, still an MLB record. He finished the 1907 season with a league-leading .350 batting average, 212 hits, 49 steals and 119 runs batted in (RBI). At age 20, he was the youngest player to win a batting championship and held this record until 1955, when fellow Detroit Tiger Al Kaline won the batting title at twelve days younger than Cobb had been. Reflecting on his career in 1930, two years after retiring, he told Grantland Rice, \"The biggest thrill I ever got came in a game against the Athletics in 1907 [on September 30]... The Athletics had us beaten, with Rube Waddell pitching. They were two runs ahead in the 9th inning, when I happened to hit a home run that tied the score. This game went 17 innings to a tie, and a few days later, we clinched our first pennant. You can understand what it meant for a 20-year-old country boy to hit a home run off the great Rube, in a pennant-winning game with two outs in the ninth.\" In the 1907 World Series, after a suspended tie in Game One, the Tigers were outclassed and swept by the Chicago Cubs, with Cobb battling an anemic .200. \nDespite great success on the field, Cobb was no stranger to controversy off it. As described in \"Smithsonian\", \"In 1907 during spring training in Augusta, Georgia, a black groundskeeper named Bungy Cummings, whom Cobb had known for years, attempted to shake Cobb's hand or pat him on the shoulder.\" The \"overly familiar greeting infuriated\" Cobb, who attacked Cummings. When Cummings' wife tried to defend him, Cobb allegedly choked her. The assault was only stopped when catcher Charles \"Boss\" Schmidt knocked Cobb out. However, aside from Schmidt's statement to the press, no other corroborating witnesses to the assault on Cummings ever came forward and Cummings himself never made a public comment about it. Author Charles Leerhsen speculates that the assault on Cummings and his wife never occurred and that it was a total fabrication by Schmidt. Cobb had spent the previous year defending himself on several occasions from assaults by Schmidt, with Schmidt often coming out of nowhere to blindside Cobb. On that day, several reporters did see Cummings, who appeared to be \"partially under the influence of liquor,\" approach Cobb and shout \"Hello, Carrie!\" (the meaning of which is unknown) and go in for a hug. Cobb then pushed him away, which was the last interaction that anyone saw between Cobb and Cummings. Shortly thereafter, hearing a fight, several reporters came running and found Cobb and Schmidt wrestling on the ground. When the fight was broken up and Cobb had walked away, Schmidt remained behind and told the reporters that he saw Cobb assaulting Cummings and his wife and had intervened. Leerhsen speculates that this was just another one of Schmidt's assaults on Cobb and that once discovered, Schmidt made up a story that made him sound like he had assaulted Cobb for a noble purpose. In 1908, Cobb attacked a black laborer in Detroit who complained when Cobb stepped into freshly poured asphalt; Cobb was found guilty of battery, but the sentence was suspended.\nIn September 1907, Cobb began a relationship with The Coca-Cola Company that lasted the remainder of his life. By the time he died, he held over 20,000 shares of stock and owned bottling plants in Santa Maria, California, Twin Falls, Idaho, and Bend, Oregon. He was also a celebrity spokesman for the product. In the offseason between 1907 and 1908, Cobb negotiated with Clemson Agricultural College of South Carolina, offering to coach baseball there \"for $250 a month, provided that he did not sign with Detroit that season.\" This did not come to pass, however.\nThe following season, the Tigers finished one game ahead of the Chicago White Sox for the pennant. Cobb again won the batting title with a .324 average. In the World Series, he performed well, batting a team-high .368 and starring in a Game 3 win, but Detroit suffered another lopsided loss to the Cubs. In August 1908, Cobb married Charlotte (\"Charlie\") Marion Lombard, the daughter of prominent Augustan Roswell Lombard. In the offseason, the couple lived on her father's Augusta estate, \"The Oaks\", until they moved into their own house on Williams Street in November 1913.\nThe Tigers won the AL pennant again in 1909. During the World Series, Cobb's last, he stole home in the second game, igniting a three-run rally, and also plated a team-high five RBIs for the series. Despite those highlights, he finished with a subpar .231 batting average, as the Tigers lost to Honus Wagner and the powerful Pittsburgh Pirates in seven games. Although the postseason was marred by another setback, he won the [Major League Baseball] Triple Crown that year by hitting .377 with 107 RBI and nine home runs, all inside the park, thus becoming the only player of the modern era to lead his league in home runs in a season without hitting a ball over the fence.\nIn the same season, Charles M. Conlon snapped the famous photograph of a grimacing Cobb sliding into third base amid a cloud of dirt, which visually captured the grit and ferocity of his playing style.\n1910: Chalmers Award controversy.\nGoing into the final days of the 1910 season, Cobb had a .004 lead on Nap Lajoie for the American League batting title. The prize for the winner of the title was a Chalmers automobile. Cobb sat out the final two games to preserve his average. Lajoie hit safely eight times in a doubleheader, but six of those hits were bunt singles. Later it was rumored that the opposing manager had instructed his third baseman to play extra deep to allow Lajoie to win the batting race over the generally disliked Cobb. Still, at the end Cobb was credited with a barely higher average. In the resulting controversy, AL president Ban Johnson was forced to arbitrate the situation. He declared Cobb the rightful owner of the title, but car company president Hugh Chalmers chose to award one to both Cobb and Lajoie. (It was later found by a researcher in the 1970s that one Detroit game had apparently been counted twice, in which case if corrected Cobb actually lost to Lajoie. Major League Baseball nevertheless recognizes Cobb as the winner, with the original stats having been grandfathered in.) \n1911\u20131914.\nCobb regarded baseball as \"something like a war,\" future Tiger second baseman Charlie Gehringer said. \"Every time at bat for him was a crusade.\" Baseball historian John Thorn said in the book \"Legends of the Fall\", \"He is testament to how far you can get simply through will. ... Cobb was pursued by demons.\"\nCobb was having a tremendous year in 1911, which included a 40-game hitting streak. Still, \"Shoeless\" Joe Jackson led him by .009 points in the batting race late in the season. It happened then that Cobb's Tigers squared off in a long series against Jackson's Cleveland Naps. Fellow Southerners Cobb and Jackson were personally friendly on and off the field. Cobb sought to use that friendship to his advantage. He ignored Jackson whenever he went to speak to him. When Jackson persisted, Cobb snapped angrily back at him, making the impressionable Jackson puzzle over what he could have done to enrage Cobb. Anecdotally, at least, these mind games contributed to a slump that dropped Jackson down to a final average of .408, twelve points lower than the .420 Cobb posted to set a modern era record until George Sisler tied it in 1922 and Rogers Hornsby surpassed it two years later with a.424 mark, the record since then (until 2024) except for Hugh Duffy's .438 in the 19th century.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI often tried plays that looked recklessly daring, maybe even silly. But I never tried anything foolish when a game was at stake, only when we were far ahead or far behind. I did it to study how the other team reacted, filing away in my mind any observations for future use.\n\u2014Ty Cobb in \"The New York Times\"\nCobb led the AL that year in numerous other categories, including 248 hits, 147 runs scored, 127 RBI, 83 stolen bases, 47 doubles, 24 triples and a .621 slugging percentage. Cobb hit eight home runs but finished second in that category to Frank Baker, who hit eleven. He was awarded another Chalmers car, this time for being voted the AL MVP by the Baseball Writers' Association of America. He also returned to playing centerfield full-time that season, the position he would occupy for most of the rest of his career.\nOn May 12, 1911, playing against the New York Highlanders, he scored from first base on a single to right field, then scored another run from second base on a wild pitch. In the seventh inning, he tied the game with a two-run double. The Highlanders catcher vehemently argued the safe call at second base with the umpire in question, going on at such length that the other Highlanders infielders gathered nearby to watch. Realizing that no one on the Highlanders had called time, Cobb strolled unobserved to third base and then casually walked towards home plate as if to get a better view of the argument. He then suddenly broke into a run and slid into home plate for the eventual winning run. It was performances like this that led Branch Rickey to say later that Cobb \"had brains in his feet.\"\nDescribing his gameplay strategy in 1930, he said, \"My system was all offense. I believed in putting up a mental hazard for the other fellow. If we were five or six runs ahead, I'd try some wild play, such as going from first to home on a single. This helped to make the other side hurry the play in a close game later on. I worked out all the angles I could think of, to keep them guessing and hurrying.\" In the same interview, Cobb talked about having noticed a throwing tendency of first baseman Hal Chase but having to wait two full years until the opportunity came to exploit it. By unexpectedly altering his own baserunning tendencies, he was able to surprise Chase and score the winning run of the game in question.\nOn May 15, 1912, Cobb assaulted a heckler, Claude Lucker (often misspelled as Lueker), in the stands in New York's Hilltop Park where the Tigers were playing the Highlanders. Lucker, described by baseball historian Frank Russo as \"a Tammany Hall lackey and two-bit punk,\" often berated Cobb when Detroit visited New York. In this game, the two traded insults through the first couple of innings. Cobb at one point went to the Highlander dugout to look for the Highlanders' owner to try to have Lucker ejected from the game, but his search was in vain. He also asked for the police to intervene, but they refused. The situation climaxed when Lucker allegedly called Cobb a \"half-nigger.\" Cobb, in his discussion of the incident in the Holmes biography, avoided such explicit words but alluded to Lucker's epithet by saying he was \"reflecting on my mother's color and morals.\" He went on to state that he warned Highlander manager Harry Wolverton that if something was not done about that man, there would be trouble. No action was taken. At the end of the sixth inning, after being challenged by teammates Sam Crawford and Jim Delahanty to do something about it, Cobb climbed into the stands and attacked Lucker, who it turned out was handicapped (he had lost all of one hand and three fingers on his other hand in an industrial accident). Some onlookers shouted at him to stop because the man had no hands, to which Cobb reportedly retorted, \"I don't care if he got no feet!\" According to Russo, the crowd cheered Cobb on in the fight. Though extremely rare in the 21st century, attacking fans was not so unusual an activity in the early years of baseball. Other notable baseball stars who assaulted heckling fans include Babe Ruth, Cy Young, Rube Waddell, Kid Gleason, Sherry Magee, and Fred Clarke.\nThe league suspended him. His teammates, backing him, went on strike to protest the suspension and the lack of protection of players from abusive fans, before the May 18 game in Philadelphia. For that one game, Detroit fielded a replacement team made up of hastily recruited college and sandlot players plus two Tiger coaches and lost 24\u20132, thereby setting some of Major League Baseball's modern-era (post-1900) negative records, notably the 26 hits in a nine-inning game allowed by Allan Travers, who pitched one of the sport's most unlikely complete games. The pre-1901 record for the most hits and runs given up in a game is held by the Cleveland Blues' Dave Rowe. Primarily an outfielder, Rowe pitched a complete game on July 24, 1882, giving up 35 runs on 29 hits. The current post-1900 record for most hits in a nine-inning game is 31, set in 1992 by the Milwaukee Brewers against Toronto; however, the Blue Jays used six pitchers.\nThe strike ended when Cobb urged his teammates to return to the field. According to him, this incident led to the formation of a players' union, the \"Ballplayers' Fraternity\" (formally, the Fraternity of Professional Baseball Players of America), an early version of what is now called the Major League Baseball Players Association, which garnered some concessions from the owners.\nDuring his career, Cobb was involved in numerous other fights, both on and off the field, and several profanity-laced shouting matches. For example, Cobb and umpire Billy Evans arranged to settle their in-game differences through fisticuffs under the grandstand after the game. Members of both teams were spectators, and broke up the scuffle after Cobb had knocked Evans down, pinned him and began choking him. In 1909, Cobb was arrested for assault for an incident that occurred in a Cleveland hotel. Cobb got into an argument with the elevator operator around 2:15\u00a0a.m. when the man refused to take him to the floor where some of his teammates were having a card game. The elevator operator stated that he could only take Cobb to the floor where his room was. As the argument escalated, a night watchman approached and he and Cobb eventually got into a physical confrontation. During the fight, Cobb produced a penknife and slashed the watchman across the hand. Cobb later claimed that the watchman, who had the upper hand in the fight, had his finger in Cobb's left eye and that Cobb was worried he was going to have his sight ruined. The fight finally ended when the watchman produced a gun and struck Cobb several times in the head, knocking him out. Cobb would later plead guilty to simple assault and pay a $100 fine. This incident has often been retold with the elevator operator and the watchman both being black. However, recent scholarship has shown that all parties involved were white.\nOn August 13, 1912, the same day the Tigers were to play the New York Highlanders at Hilltop Park, Cobb reported that he and his wife were driving to a train station in Syracuse that was to transport him to the game when three intoxicated men had stopped him on the way. When Cobb got out of the car to confront the men, they had asked for money and instigated a physical fight, with Cobb defending himself from one of the men by punching him in the chin as another fled the scene. After being grabbed by the neck by the third man, the man had pulled a knife and stabbed him in the back before he forced him away and returned to his car to continue driving to the station for the game. Cobb refused to speak any further of the incident. He would go on to hit 2\u20133 with two singles and a run scored in the game, though the Tigers lost 2\u20133. \nFor the 1912 season, Cobb again batted over .400 at .409, but Detroit sank to sixth place in the American League standings, by far a new low in the years following their pennant wins.\nIn 1913, Cobb signed a contract worth $12,000 for the six-month season (), making him likely the first baseball player in history to be paid a five-figure salary. This occurred in the same year where Cobb had allegedly grown pessimistic and was quoted as saying: \"It seems I am a burden to the Detroit club, as a trespasser of its rules. If that be the case, let Mr. Navin put a price on me and I'll take a chance on being able to negotiate my own release. I don't think I shall ever play ball again. This is positively my last statement in this matter.\" This attributed statement was first published on an April 19, 1913, edition of the Los Angeles Herald. (Cobb did not play that day as the Tigers won 4\u20130 against the St. Louis Browns.) A second straight sixth-place campaign by Detroit probably contributed to his negativity.\nIn June 1914, Cobb pleaded guilty to disturbing the peace after pulling a revolver during an argument at a Detroit butcher shop. He was fined $50 ().\n1915\u20131921.\nIn 1915, Cobb set the single-season record for stolen bases with 96, which stood until Dodger Maury Wills broke it in 1962. That year, he also won his record ninth consecutive batting title, hitting .369. The Tigers surged back to win 100 games in 1915, the most during Cobb's career, but finished second behind the Boston Red Sox.\nDuring 1917 spring training, Cobb showed up late for a Dallas spring training doubleheader against the New York Giants because of a golf outing. Several of the Giants, including Buck Herzog, called him names from the bench. Cobb retaliated by spiking Herzog during the second game, prompting a bench-clearing brawl in which Cobb ground Herzog's face in the dirt. The Dallas Police Department had to help stop the brawl, and Cobb was thrown out of the game. Both teams were staying at the Oriental Hotel, and at dinner that evening, Herzog walked up to Cobb and challenged him to a fight. The two met an hour later in Cobb's room, where the Tiger outfielder had prepared for the fight by moving furniture out of the way and pouring water on the floor. Cobb's leather-soled shoes enabled him to get better footing than Herzog, who wore tennis shoes. The fight lasted for thirty minutes, over the course of which Cobb knocked down Herzog about six times while Herzog only knocked Cobb down once. The scuffle left Herzog's face bloodied and his eyes nearly shut. With Herzog vowing revenge, Cobb skipped the rest of the exhibition series against the Giants, heading to Cincinnati to train with the Reds, who were managed by Cobb's friend Christy Mathewson. However, Cobb later expressed the deepest respect for Herzog because of the way the infielder had conducted himself in the fight.\nIn 1917, Cobb hit in 35 consecutive games, still the only player with two 35-game hitting streaks (including his 40-game streak in 1911). He had six hitting streaks of at least 20 games in his career, second only to Pete Rose's eight.\nAlso in 1917, Cobb starred in the motion picture \"Somewhere in Georgia\" for a sum of $25,000 plus expenses (equivalent to approximately $ today). Based on a story by sports columnist Grantland Rice, the film casts Cobb as \"himself,\" a small-town Georgia bank clerk with a talent for baseball. Broadway critic Ward Morehouse called the movie \"absolutely the worst flicker I ever saw, pure hokum.\"\nIn October 1918, Cobb enlisted in the Chemical Corps branch of the United States Army and was sent to the Allied Expeditionary Forces headquarters in Chaumont, France. He served approximately 67 days overseas before being honorably discharged and returning to the United States. He was given the rank of captain underneath the command of Major Branch Rickey, the president of the St. Louis Cardinals. Other baseball players serving in this unit included Captain Christy Mathewson and Lieutenant George Sisler. All of these men were assigned to the Gas and Flame Division, where they trained soldiers in preparation for chemical attacks by exposing them to gas chambers in a controlled environment, which eventually caused Mathewson to contract the tuberculosis that killed him on the eve of the 1925 World Series.\nOn August 19, 1921, in the second game of a doubleheader against Elmer Myers of the Boston Red Sox, Cobb collected his 3,000th hit. Aged 34 at the time, he is still the youngest ballplayer to reach that milestone, and in the fewest at-bats (8,093).\nBy 1920, Babe Ruth, sold to the renamed New York Yankees from the Boston Red Sox, had established himself as a power hitter, something Cobb was not considered to be. When his Tigers showed up in New York to play the Yankees for the first time that season, writers billed it as a showdown between two stars of competing styles of play. Ruth hit two homers, a triple, and two singles during the series, compared to Cobb's two hits of a double and a single.\nAs Ruth's popularity grew, Cobb became increasingly hostile toward him. He saw the Babe not only as a threat to his style of play, but also to his style of life. Perhaps what angered him the most about Ruth was that despite Babe's total disregard for his physical condition and traditional baseball, he was still an overwhelming success and brought fans to the ballparks in record numbers to see him challenge his own slugging records.\nOn May 5, 1925, Cobb told a reporter that, for the first time in his career, he was going to try to hit home runs, saying he wanted to show that he could hit home runs but simply chose not to. That day, he went 6 for 6, with two singles, a double and three homers. The 16 total bases set a new AL record, which stood until May 8, 2012, when Josh Hamilton of the Texas Rangers hit four home runs and a double for a total of 18 bases. The next day Cobb had three more hits, two of which were home runs. The single his first time up gave him nine consecutive hits over three games, while his five homers in two games tied the record set by Cap Anson of the old Chicago NL team in 1884. By the end of the series Cobb had gone 12 for 19 with 29 total bases, and afterwards reverted to his old playing style. Even so, when asked in 1930 by Grantland Rice to name the best hitter he'd ever seen, Cobb answered, \"You can't beat the Babe. Ruth is one of the few who can take a terrific swing and still meet the ball solidly. His timing is perfect. [No one has] the combined power and eye of Ruth.\"\nPlayer-manager career.\nDetroit Tigers (1921\u20131926).\nTigers owner Frank Navin tapped Cobb to take over for Hughie Jennings as manager for the 1921 season, a deal he signed on his 34th birthday for $32,500 (equivalent to approximately $ in today's terms). The signing surprised the baseball world. Although Cobb was a legendary player, he was regarded as disliked throughout the baseball community, even by his own teammates.\nThe closest Cobb came to winning another pennant was in 1924, when the Tigers finished in third place, six games behind the pennant-winning Washington Senators. The Tigers had also finished third in 1922, but 16 games behind the Yankees, and second in 1923. Cobb blamed his lackluster managerial record (479 wins against 444 losses) on Navin, who was arguably even more frugal than he was, passing up several quality players Cobb wanted to add to the team. In fact, he had saved money by hiring Cobb to both play and manage.\nIn 1922, Cobb tied a batting record set by Wee Willie Keeler, with four five-hit games in a season. This has since been matched by Stan Musial, Tony Gwynn and Ichiro Suzuki. On May 10, 1924, Cobb was honored at ceremonies before a game in Washington, D.C., by more than 100 dignitaries and legislators. He received 21 books, one for each year in professional baseball.\nAt the end of 1925, Cobb was again embroiled in a batting title race, this time with one of his teammates and players, Harry Heilmann. In a doubleheader against the St. Louis Browns on October 4, 1925, Heilmann got six hits to lead the Tigers to a sweep of the doubleheader and beat Cobb for the batting crown, .393 to .389. Cobb and Browns player-manager George Sisler each pitched in the final game, Cobb pitching a perfect inning.\nPhiladelphia Athletics (1927\u20131928).\nCobb announced his retirement after a 22-year career as a Tiger in November 1926, and headed home to Augusta, Georgia. Shortly thereafter, Tris Speaker also retired as player-manager of the Cleveland Indians. The retirement of two great players at the same time sparked some interest, and it turned out that the two were coerced into retirement because of allegations of game-fixing brought about by Dutch Leonard, a former pitcher managed by Cobb.\nLeonard accused former pitcher and outfielder Smoky Joe Wood and Cobb of betting on a Tigers\u2013Indians game played in Detroit on September 25, 1919, in which they allegedly orchestrated a Tigers victory to win the bet. Leonard claimed proof existed in letters written to him by Cobb and Wood. Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis held a secret hearing with Cobb, Speaker and Wood. A second secret meeting among the AL directors led to the unpublicized resignations of Cobb and Speaker; however, rumors of the scandal led Judge Landis to hold additional hearings in which Leonard refused to participate. Cobb and Wood admitted to writing the letters, but claimed that a horse-racing bet was involved and that Leonard's accusations were in retaliation for Cobb's having released him from the Tigers, thereby demoting him to the minor leagues. Speaker denied any wrongdoing.\nOn January 27, 1927, Judge Landis cleared Cobb and Speaker of any wrongdoing because of Leonard's refusal to appear at the hearings. Landis allowed both Cobb and Speaker to return to their original teams, but each team let them know that they were free agents and could sign with any club they wanted. Speaker signed with the Washington Senators for 1927, and Cobb with the Philadelphia Athletics. Speaker then joined Cobb in Philadelphia for the 1928 season. Cobb said he had come back only to seek vindication and say he left baseball on his own terms.\nCobb played regularly in 1927 for a young and talented team that finished second to one of the greatest teams of all time, the 110\u201344 1927 Yankees, returning to Detroit to a tumultuous welcome on May 10 and doubling his first time up to the cheers of Tigers fans. On July 18, Cobb became the first member of the 4,000 hit club when he doubled off former teammate Sam Gibson, still pitching for the Tigers, at Navin Field.\nCobb returned for the 1928 season but played less frequently due to his age and the blossoming abilities of the young A's, who were again in a pennant race with the Yankees. On September 3, Ty Cobb pinch-hit in the ninth inning of the first game of a doubleheader against the Senators and doubled off Bump Hadley for his last career hit, although his final at-bats were not until September 11 against the Yankees, when he popped out off Hank Johnson and grounded out to shortstop Mark Koenig.\nRetirement.\nCobb announced his retirement September 11, 1928, effective the end of the season. He batted .300 or higher in 23 consecutive seasons (his only other season under .300 being his rookie season), a major league record that is unlikely to be broken, and won a record 12 batting titles (in 13 years), with a pair of seasons over .400 in batting average (and a high of .419). Despite not being known as a slugger, he led the AL in RBI's four times, rapped 295 triples, won the 1909 AL Triple Crown, and led the AL in slugging percentage eight times in his 11 seasons from 1907 to 1917, being the only player beside Babe Ruth ever to lead in that category in six or more consecutive years.\nFleet afoot, Cobb led the American League 6 times in stolen bases, retiring with a modern record of 897 steals, a full 256 ahead of his closest competitor, and a record that stood for 49 years.\nAn aggressive fielder, Cobb retired with 271 errors as an outfielder, 14th on the all-time list as of 2025, which stands as a record for 20th century on players.\nPost-playing career.\nCobb retired a wealthy and successful man. He toured Europe with his family, went to Scotland for some time and then returned to his farm in Georgia. He spent his retirement pursuing his off-season avocations of hunting, golfing, polo, and fishing. His other pastime was trading stocks and bonds, increasing his immense personal wealth. He was a major stockholder in the Coca-Cola Corporation, which by itself would have made him wealthy.\nIn the winter of 1930, Cobb moved into a Spanish ranch estate on Spencer Lane in the affluent town of Atherton located south of San Francisco, California, on the San Francisco Peninsula. At the same time, his wife Charlie filed the first of several divorce suits but withdrew the suit shortly thereafter. The couple eventually divorced in 1947 after 39 years of marriage, the last few years of which Cobb's wife lived in nearby Menlo Park. The couple had three sons and two daughters: Tyrus Raymond Jr, Shirley Marion, Herschel Roswell, James Howell, and Beverly.\nCobb's children found him to be demanding, yet also capable of kindness and extreme warmth. He expected his sons to be exceptional athletes in general and baseball players in particular. Tyrus Raymond, Jr. flunked out of Princeton (where he had played on the varsity tennis team), much to his father's dismay. The elder Cobb traveled to the Princeton campus and beat his son with a whip to ensure against future academic failure. Tyrus Raymond, Jr. then entered Yale University and became captain of the tennis team while improving his academics, but was then arrested twice in 1930 for drunkenness and left Yale without graduating. Cobb helped his son deal with his pending legal problems, but then permanently broke off with him. Even though Tyrus Raymond, Jr. finally reformed and eventually earned an M.D. from the Medical College of South Carolina and practiced obstetrics and gynecology in Dublin, Georgia, until his death at 42 on September 9, 1952, from a brain tumor, his father remained distant.\nIn February 1936, when the first Baseball Hall of Fame election results were announced, Cobb had been named on 222 of 226 ballots, outdistancing Babe Ruth, Honus Wagner, Christy Mathewson, and Walter Johnson, the only others to earn the necessary 75% of votes to be elected that first year. His 98.2% stood as the record until Tom Seaver received 98.8% of the vote in 1992. Those results show that although many people disliked him personally, the baseball writers greatly respected the way he had played and all he had accomplished. In 1998, \"Sporting News\" ranked him as third on the list of 100 Greatest Baseball Players.\nOf major league stars of the 1940s and 1950s, Cobb had positive things to say about Stan Musial, Phil Rizzuto, and Jackie Robinson, but few others. Even so, he was known to help out young players. He was instrumental in helping Joe DiMaggio negotiate his rookie contract with the New York Yankees.\nAccording to sportswriter Grantland Rice, he and Cobb were returning from the Masters golf tournament in the late 1940s and stopped at a Greenville, South Carolina, liquor store. Cobb noticed that the man behind the counter was \"Shoeless\" Joe Jackson, who had been banned from baseball almost 30 years earlier following the Black Sox scandal. Jackson did not appear to recognize him, and after making his purchase an incredulous Cobb asked, \"Don't you know me, Joe?\" \"Sure, I know you, Ty\" replied Jackson, \"but I wasn't sure you wanted to know me. A lot of them don't.\"\nCobb was mentioned in the poem \"Line-Up for Yesterday\" by Ogden Nash:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Line-Up for Yesterday\"\nC is for Cobb,Who grew spikes and not corn,And made all the basemenWish they weren't born.\n \u2014Ogden Nash, \"Sport\" magazine (January 1949) \nLater life.\nIn 1949, at the age of 62, Cobb married a second time, to 40-year-old Frances Fairbairn Cass, a divorc\u00e9e from Buffalo, New York. Their childless marriage ending with a divorce in 1956. At this time, Cobb became generous with his wealth, donating $100,000 in his parents' name for his hometown to build a modern 24-bed hospital, Cobb Memorial Hospital, which is now part of the Ty Cobb Healthcare System. He also established the Cobb Educational Fund, which awarded scholarships to needy Georgia students bound for college, by endowing it with a $100,000 donation in 1953 (equivalent to approximately $ in current year dollars ).\nCobb knew that another way he could share his wealth was by having biographies written that would both set the record straight on him and teach young players how to play. John McCallum spent some time with Cobb to write a combination how-to and biography titled \"The Tiger Wore Spikes: An Informal Biography of Ty Cobb\" that was published in 1956. In December 1959, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, and Bright's disease.\nIt was also during his final years that Cobb began work on his autobiography, \"My Life in Baseball: The True Record\", with writer Al Stump. Cobb retained editorial control over the book and the published version presented him in a positive light. Stump said that the collaboration was contentious, and after Cobb's death Stump published two more books and a short story giving what he said was the \"true story.\" One of these later books was used as the basis for the 1994 film \"Cobb\" (a box office flop starring Tommy Lee Jones as Cobb and directed by Ron Shelton). In 2010, an article by William R. \"Ron\" Cobb (no relation) in the peer-reviewed \"The National Pastime\" (the official publication of the Society for American Baseball Research) accused Stump of extensive forgeries of Cobb-related documents and diaries. The article further accused Stump of numerous false statements about Cobb in his last years, most of which were sensationalistic in nature and intended to cast Cobb in an unflattering light.\nDeath.\nIn his last days, Cobb spent some time with the old movie comedian Joe E. Brown, talking about the choices he had made in his life. According to Brown, Cobb said he felt that he had made mistakes and that he would do things differently if he could. He had played hard and lived hard all his life, had no friends to show for it at the end, and regretted it. Publicly, however, he claimed to have no regrets: \"I've been lucky. I have no right to be regretful of what I did.\"\nHe was taken to Emory University Hospital for the last time in June 1961 after falling into a diabetic coma. His first wife Charlie, his son Jimmy, and other family members came to be with him for his final days. He died there on July 17, 1961, at age 74.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n...the most sensational player of all the players I have seen in all my life...\n\u2014Casey Stengel, \"The New York Times\", July 18, 1961 regarding Ty Cobb shortly after Cobb's death\nApproximately 150 friends and relatives attended a brief service in Cornelia, Georgia, and drove to the Cobb family mausoleum in Royston for the burial. Cobb's family kept the event private, not trusting the media to report accurately on it. Baseball's only representatives at his funeral were three old-time players, Ray Schalk, Mickey Cochrane, and Nap Rucker, and Sid Keener, the director of the Baseball Hall of Fame, but messages of condolence numbered in the hundreds and included notes from Joe DiMaggio and Ted Williams. Family in attendance included Cobb's former wife Charlie, his two daughters, his surviving son Jimmy, his two sons-in-law, his daughter-in-law Mary Dunn Cobb and her two children.\nAt the time of his death, Cobb's estate was reported to be worth at least $11.78 million (equivalent to $ today), including $10 million worth of General Motors stock and $1.78 million in The Coca-Cola Company stock. His will left a quarter of his estate to the Cobb Educational Fund, and distributed the rest among his children and grandchildren. Cobb is interred in the Rose Hill Cemetery in Royston, Georgia. As of April 2021, the Ty Cobb Educational Foundation has distributed $19.2 million in college scholarships to needy college bound Georgia students.\nLegacy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe greatness of Ty Cobb was something that had to be seen, and to see him was to remember him forever.\n\u2014George Sisler\nThe historian Steven Elliott Tripp has explored the public's reaction to Cobb as a pioneer sports celebrity and \"a player fans loved to hate.\" Tripp writes that Cobb was both loved and hated as a representative of a particular kind of masculinity on the field, inviting male spectators to participate in the contest through taunts directed at opposing players. Cobb's own sense of manhood, according to Tripp, was a product of his Southern upbringing that prized individualism, excitement, and family honor. Russo wrote, \"There is no denying that Cobb ranks as one of baseball's greatest players, if not the game's fiercest competitor.\" Many of baseball's greatest players were friends with Cobb. Mathewson and Walter Johnson were some of his closest friends. Others included Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams, Home Run Baker, and Eddie Collins. Following his retirement, Cobb even befriended one of his greatest rivals, Babe Ruth, whose wife Claire was from Georgia.\nCobb has been judged by some historians and journalists as the best player of the dead-ball era, and is generally seen as one of the greatest players of all time.\nSome historians, including Wesley Fricks, Dan Holmes, and Charles Leerhsen, have defended Cobb against unfair portrayals of him in popular culture since his death. A noted case is the book written by sportswriter Al Stump in the months after Cobb died in 1961. Stump was later discredited when it became known that he had stolen items belonging to Cobb and also betrayed the access Cobb gave him in his final months. As a result of the movie \"Cobb\", which starred Tommy Lee Jones, there are many myths surrounding Cobb's life, including one that he sharpened his spikes to inflict wounds on opposing players. This accusation was common for many decades before the movie was released.\nWriting in \"The Journal of American Culture\", Hunter M. Hampton says that Leerhsen \"succeeds in debunking the myth of Cobb that Stump created, but he spawned a new myth by conflating Stump's shortcomings to depict Cobb as an egalitarian.\"\nIn 1977, a statue of Ty Cobb, designed by the sculptor Felix de Weldon, was installed outside the Atlanta\u2013Fulton County Stadium. It would later be relocated to the front of the public library in his hometown of Royston in 2017.\nViews on race.\nFive years after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier, Cobb publicly supported blacks and whites playing baseball together, adding: \"Certainly it is okay for them to play. I see no reason in the world why we shouldn't compete with colored athletes as long as they conduct themselves with politeness and gentility. Let me say also that no white man has the right to be less of a gentleman than a colored man; in my book that goes not only for baseball but in all walks of life.\" Using even stronger language, Cobb told the \"Sporting News\" in 1952 that \"the Negro should be accepted and not grudgingly but wholeheartedly.\" \nIn 1953, black newspapers cited his praise for Brooklyn Dodgers' catcher Roy Campanella, who Cobb said was \"among the all-time best catchers\" in the sport. Following Campanella's accident that left him paralyzed, the Dodgers staged a tribute game where tens of thousands of spectators silently held lit matches above their heads. Cobb wrote the Dodgers owner to show appreciation \"for what you did for this fine man.\" Cobb also stated that Willie Mays was the \"only player I'd pay money to see.\" In the obituaries that ran in the black press following Cobb's death, he was praised for \"[speaking] in favor of racial freedom in baseball.\"\nLeerhesen also notes Cobb was the \"main defender and patron\" of Ulysses Simon Harrison, an African-American youth who was the Tigers' mascot from 1908 to 1910 under the name \"L'il Rastus\". \"Rastus\" was then understood as the name of a stereotypical foolish, carefree or ignorant black man. Cobb, unlike most players, did not rub the boy's head for good luck. Cobb took a protective attitude towards Harrison when the team was traveling in racially-segregated areas, and also employed him during the off-season at Cobb's automobile dealership. As an adult, Harrison worked as a chauffeur for construction executive F. H. Goddard, a job he might have secured with Cobb's assistance.\nRivalry with Sam Crawford.\nSam Crawford and Ty Cobb were teammates for parts of thirteen seasons. They played beside each other in right and center field, and Crawford followed Cobb in the batting order year after year. Despite the physical closeness, the two had a complicated relationship.\nInitially, they had a student-teacher relationship. Crawford was an established star when Cobb arrived, and Cobb eagerly sought his advice. The student\u2013teacher relationship gradually changed to one of jealous rivals. Cobb was not popular with his teammates, and as Cobb became the biggest star in baseball, Crawford was unhappy with the preferential treatment given to Cobb. Cobb was allowed to show up late for spring training and was given private quarters on the road \u2013 perks not offered to Crawford. The competition between the two was intense. Crawford recalled that, if he went three for four on a day when Cobb went hitless, Cobb would turn red and sometimes walk out of the park with the game still on. When it was reported that Nap Lajoie had won the batting title, Crawford was alleged to have been one of several Tigers who sent a telegram to Lajoie congratulating him on beating Cobb.\nIn retirement, Cobb wrote a letter to a writer for \"The Sporting News\" accusing Crawford of not helping in the outfield and of intentionally fouling off balls when Cobb was stealing a base. Crawford learned about the letter in 1946 and accused Cobb of being a \"cheapskate\" who never helped his teammates. He said that Cobb had not been a very good fielder, \"so he blamed me.\" Crawford denied intentionally trying to deprive Cobb of stolen bases, insisting that Cobb had \"dreamed that up.\"\nWhen asked about the feud, Cobb attributed it to envy. He felt that Crawford was \"a hell of a good player,\" but he was \"second best\" on the Tigers and \"hated to be an also ran.\" Cobb biographer Richard Bak noted that the two \"only barely tolerated each other\" and agreed with Cobb that Crawford's attitude was driven by Cobb's having stolen Crawford's thunder.\nAlthough they may not have spoken to each other, Cobb and Crawford developed an ability to communicate non-verbally with looks and nods on the base paths. They became one of the most successful double steal pairings in baseball history.\nRegular season statistics.\nBatting average revision.\nWhen Cobb retired, and for most of the next 70 years following it, he was officially regarded to have had the highest batting average in major league history at .367. This was based on the \"best available\" statistics, recorded and compiled as they were generated. However, scrupulous modern research reconstructing and verifying box scores game by game revealed a fraction of a .001 point error, reducing Cobb's average to .366 among numerous reputable sources.\nMajor League Baseball itself is divided on whether to continue to honor Cobb's traditional average (based on 4,191 hits in 11,429 at-bats) or bow to revised records. According to longtime baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn, who served between 1969 and 1984, Major League Baseball would continue to report the traditional value based on it being grandfathered. In his words (stated in 1981), \"The passage of 70\u00a0years, in our judgment, constitutes a certain statute of limitation as to recognizing any changes.\"\nOther major reliable sources agree on .366. Some show slightly different numbers for at-bats and hits: SABR (the Society for American Baseball Research) (seconded by John Thorn and Pete Palmer, among others), the Baseball Almanac, and ESPN credit Cobb with 4,189 hits in 11,434 at-bats. Retrosheet gives Cobb the same number of hits in five more at-bats (11,439), and Baseball Reference and the Baseball Hall of Fame add one more at-bat (11,440). \nMLB, however, does not insist on censoring even its own, allowing the 2016 publication of an article reporting the .366 figure and its revision by other bodies even on its own website, mlb.com.\nCareer totals.\nIn other statistics compiled during his career, Retrosheet indicates Cobb recorded 1 six-hit game, 13 five-hit games, and 82 four-hit games in his MLB career. \nCobb's career totals from Baseball Reference are as follows. Other sources may have slightly different figures. Caught Stealing is not shown comprehensively because the stat was not regularly recorded until 1920.\nCobb's career totals published by Major League Baseball Enterprises, Inc. are shown below:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBook sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was laid between Kerrera, Oban, Scotland, and Clarenville, Newfoundland. Two cables were laid between 1955 and 1956 with one cable for each direction. It was inaugurated on September 25, 1956. The cable was able to carry 35 simultaneous telephone calls. A 36th channel was used to carry up to 22 telegraph lines.\nHistory.\nThe first transatlantic telegraph cable had been laid in 1858 (see Cyrus West Field). It only operated for a month, but was replaced with a successful connection in 1866. A radio-based transatlantic telephone service was started in 1927, charging \u00a39 (about US$45, or roughly $550 in 2010 dollars) for three minutes and handling around 300,000 calls a year. Although a telephone cable was discussed at that time, it was not practical until a number of technological advances arrived in the 1940s.\nThe developments that made TAT-1 possible were coaxial cable, polyethylene insulation (replacing gutta-percha), very reliable vacuum tubes for the submerged repeaters, and a general improvement in carrier equipment. Transistors were not used, being a recent invention of unknown longevity.\nThe agreement to make the connection was announced by the Postmaster General on December 1, 1953. The project was a joint one between the General Post Office of the UK, the American Telephone and Telegraph company, and the Canadian Overseas Telecommunications Corporation. The share split in the scheme was 40% British, 50% American, and 10% Canadian. The total cost was about \u00a3120 million.\nThere were to be two main cables, one for each direction of transmission. Each cable was produced and laid in three sections, two shallow-water armored sections, and one continuous central section long. The electronic repeaters were designed by the Bell Telephone Laboratories of the United States and they were inserted into the cable at intervals \u2013 for a total of 51 repeaters in the central section. The armored cables were manufactured southeast of London, at a factory in Erith, Kent, owned by Submarine Cables Ltd. (owned jointly by Siemens Brothers &amp; Co, Ltd, and The Telegraph Construction &amp; Maintenance Company, Ltd).\nThe cables were laid over the summers of 1955 and 1956, with the majority of the work done by the cable ship HMTS \"Monarch\". At the land-end in Gallanach Bay near Oban, Scotland, the cable was connected to coaxial (and then 24-circuit carrier lines) carrying the transatlantic circuits via Glasgow and Inverness to the International Exchange at Faraday Building in London. At the cable landing point in Newfoundland the cable joined at Clarenville, then crossed the Cabot Strait by another submarine cable to Sydney Mines, Nova Scotia. From there the communications traffic was routed to the US border by a microwave radio relay link, and in Brunswick, Maine, the route joined the main US network and branched to Montreal to connect with the Canadian network.\nOpened on September 25, 1956, TAT-1 carried 588 London\u2013US calls and 119 London\u2013Canada calls in the first 24 hours of public service.\nThe original 36 channels were 4\u00a0kHz bandwidth. The increase to 48 channels was accomplished by narrowing the bandwidth to 3\u00a0kHz. Later, an additional three channels were added by use of C carrier equipment. Time-assignment speech interpolation (TASI) was implemented on the TAT-1 cable in June 1960 and effectively increased the cable's capacity from 37 (out of 51 available channels) to 72 speech circuits.\nTAT-1 carried the Moscow\u2013Washington hotline between the American and Soviet heads of state, although using a teleprinter rather than voice calls as written communications were regarded as less likely to be misinterpreted. The link became operational on 13 July 1963 and was principally motivated as a result of the Cuban Missile Crisis where it took the US, for example, nearly 12 hours to receive and decode the initial settlement message that contained approx. 3,000 words. By the time the message was decoded and interpreted, and an answer had been prepared, another, more aggressive message had been received.\nIn May 1957, TAT-1 was used to transmit a concert by the singer and civil rights activist Paul Robeson, performing in New York, to St Pancras Town Hall in London. Due to McCarthyism, Robeson's passport had been withdrawn by the United States authorities in 1950. Unable to accept numerous invitations to perform abroad, he stated, \"We have to learn the hard way that there is another way to sing.\" The 15 minute connection, which required a music-quality circuit, cost \u00a3300 (~\u00a36,500 as of 2015). Robeson performed this way again in October 1957 when he linked up to the Grand Pavilion, Porthcawl, Wales, fulfilling an invitation to the eisteddfod there. A 10-inch record featuring selections from the event, entitled \"Transatlantic Exchange\", was issued by South Wales area of the National Union of Mineworkers as a fundraiser and protest at Robeson's treatment.\nAfter the success of TAT-1, a number of other TAT cables were laid, and TAT-1 was retired in 1978.\nThe TAT-1 was named an IEEE milestone in 2006.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31591", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31591", "title": "Time travel", "text": "Hypothetical travel into the past or future\nTime travel is the hypothetical activity of traveling into the past or future. Time travel is a concept in philosophy and fiction, particularly science fiction. In fiction, time travel is typically achieved through the use of a device known as a time machine. The idea of a time machine was popularized by H. G. Wells's 1895 novel \"The Time Machine\".\nIt is uncertain whether time travel to the past would be physically possible. Such travel, if at all feasible, may give rise to questions of causality. Forward time travel, outside the usual sense of the perception of time, is an extensively observed phenomenon and is well understood within the framework of special relativity and general relativity. However, making one body advance or delay more than a few milliseconds compared to another body is not feasible with current technology. As for backward time travel, it is possible to find solutions in general relativity that allow for it, such as a rotating black hole. Traveling to an arbitrary point in spacetime has very limited support in theoretical physics, and is usually connected only with quantum mechanics or wormholes.\nHistory of the concept.\nIn religion.\nSome ancient stories feature characters who appear to leap forward in time. \"Vishnu Purana\", in Hindu mythology narrate the myth of Raivata Kakudmi, who visits the god Brahma in heaven and returns to Earth to find that many ages have passed. In the Buddhist P\u0101li Canon, the Payasi Sutta describes how the disciple Kumara Kassapa explains to a skeptic that time flows differently in the heavenly realms. The Japanese legend of \"Urashima Tar\u014d\", first recorded in the \"Manyoshu\", tells of a fisherman who visits an undersea palace for three days, only to return and find that centuries have passed and his world is gone.\nIn one tradition in Judaism, Moses is transported by God to the study hall of Rabbi Akiva, where he is confused by the future evolution of Jewish law. Another Talmudic story features Honi HaMe'agel, a 1st-century BCE miracle worker who sees a man planting a carob tree that will take 70 years to bear fruit. Honi falls asleep and awakens 70 years later to find the tree fully grown and its fruit being harvested by the man's grandson.\nIn Islam, the Quran narrates the story of the Seven Sleepers, a group of monotheistic young men who sought refuge in a cave to escape persecution. As they slept, Allah preserved them for centuries, and when they awoke, they discovered that the world around them had changed. This narrative, found in the Quranic Surah Al-Kahf, describes divine protection and time suspension.\nScience fiction.\nTime travel themes in science fiction and the media can be grouped into three categories: immutable timeline; mutable timeline; and alternate histories, as in the interacting-many-worlds interpretation. The non-scientific term 'timeline' is often used to refer to all physical events in history, so that where events are changed, the time traveler is described as creating a new timeline.\nEarly science fiction stories feature characters who sleep for years and awaken in a changed society, or are transported to the past through supernatural means. Among them \"L'An 2440, r\u00eave s'il en f\u00fbt jamais\" (\"The Year 2440: A Dream If Ever There Was One\", 1770) by Louis-S\u00e9bastien Mercier, \"Rip Van Winkle\" (1819) by Washington Irving, \"Looking Backward\" (1888) by Edward Bellamy, and \"When the Sleeper Awakes\" (1899) by H. G. Wells. Prolonged sleep is used as a means of time travel in these stories. \nThe date of the earliest work about backwards time travel is uncertain. The Chinese novel \"A Supplement to the Journey to the West\" (c.\u20091640) by Dong Yue features magical mirrors and jade gateways that connect various points in time. The protagonist Sun Wukong travels back in time to the \"World of the Ancients\" (Qin dynasty) to retrieve a magical bell and then travels forward to the \"World of the Future\" (Song dynasty) to find an emperor who has been exiled in time. However, the time travel is taking place inside an illusory dream world created by the villain to distract and entrap him. Samuel Madden's \"Memoirs of the Twentieth Century\" (1733) is a series of letters from British ambassadors in 1997 and 1998 to diplomats in the past, conveying the political and religious conditions of the future. Because the narrator receives these letters from his guardian angel, Paul Alkon suggests in his book \"Origins of Futuristic Fiction\" that \"the first time-traveler in English literature is a guardian angel\". Madden does not explain how the angel obtains these documents, but Alkon asserts that Madden \"deserves recognition as the first to toy with the rich idea of time-travel in the form of an artifact sent backward from the future to be discovered in the present\". In the science fiction anthology \"Far Boundaries\" (1951), editor August Derleth claims that an early short story about time travel is \"An Anachronism; or, Missing One's Coach\", written for the \"Dublin Literary Magazine\" by an anonymous author in the https://. While the narrator waits under a tree for a coach to take him out of Newcastle upon Tyne, he is transported back in time over a thousand years. He encounters the Venerable Bede in a monastery and explains to him the developments of the coming centuries. However, the story never makes it clear whether these events are real or a dream. Another early work about time travel is \"The Forebears of Kalimeros: Alexander, son of Philip of Macedon\" by Alexander Veltman published in 1836.\n Charles Dickens's \"A Christmas Carol\" (1843) has early depictions of mystical time travel in both directions, as the protagonist, Ebenezer Scrooge, is transported to Christmases past and future. Other stories employ the same template, where a character naturally goes to sleep, and upon waking up finds themself in a different time. A clearer example of backward time travel is found in the 1861 book \"Paris avant les hommes\" (\"Paris before Men\") by the French botanist and geologist Pierre Boitard, published posthumously. In this story, the protagonist is transported to the prehistoric past by the magic of a \"lame demon\" (a French pun on Boitard's name), where he encounters a Plesiosaur and an apelike ancestor and is able to interact with ancient creatures. Edward Everett Hale's \"Hands Off\" (1881) tells the story of an unnamed being, possibly the soul of a person who has recently died, who interferes with ancient Egyptian history by preventing Joseph's enslavement. This may have been the first story to feature an alternate history created as a result of time travel.\nEarly time machines.\nOne of the first stories to feature time travel by means of a machine is \"The Clock that Went Backward\" by Edward Page Mitchell, which appeared in the \"New York Sun\" in 1881. However, the mechanism borders on fantasy. An unusual clock, when wound, runs backwards and transports people nearby back in time. The author does not explain the origin or properties of the clock. Enrique Gaspar y Rimbau's \"El Anacron\u00f3pete\" (1887) may have been the first story to feature a vessel engineered to travel through time. Andrew Sawyer has commented that the story \"does seem to be the first literary description of a time machine noted so far\", adding that \"Edward Page Mitchell's story \"The Clock That Went Backward\" (1881) is usually described as the first time-machine story, but I'm not sure that a clock quite counts\". H. G. Wells' \"The Time Machine\" (1895) popularized the concept of time travel by mechanical means.\nTime travel in physics.\nSome solutions to Einstein's equations for general relativity suggest that suitable geometries of spacetime or specific types of motion in space might allow time travel into the past and future if these geometries or motions were possible. In technical papers, physicists discuss the possibility of closed timelike curves, which are world lines that form closed loops in spacetime, allowing objects to return to their own past. There are known to be solutions to the equations of general relativity that describe spacetimes which contain closed timelike curves, such as G\u00f6del spacetime, but the physical plausibility of these solutions is uncertain.\nAny theory that would allow backward time travel would introduce potential problems of causality. The classic example of a problem involving causality is the \"grandfather paradox,\" which postulates travelling to the past and intervening in the conception of one's ancestors (causing the death of an ancestor before conception being frequently cited). Some physicists, such as Novikov and Deutsch, suggested that these sorts of temporal paradoxes can be avoided through the Novikov self-consistency principle or a variation of the many-worlds interpretation with interacting worlds.\nGeneral relativity.\nTime travel to the past is theoretically possible in certain general relativity spacetime geometries that permit traveling faster than the speed of light, such as cosmic strings, traversable wormholes, and Alcubierre drives. The theory of general relativity does suggest a scientific basis for the possibility of backward time travel in certain unusual scenarios, although arguments from semiclassical gravity suggest that when quantum effects are incorporated into general relativity, these loopholes may be closed. These semiclassical arguments led Stephen Hawking to formulate the chronology protection conjecture, suggesting that the fundamental laws of nature prevent time travel, but physicists cannot come to a definitive judgment on the issue without a theory of quantum gravity to join quantum mechanics and general relativity into a completely unified theory.\nDifferent spacetime geometries.\nThe theory of general relativity describes the universe under a system of field equations that determine the metric, or distance function, of spacetime. There exist exact solutions to these equations that include closed time-like curves, which are world lines that intersect themselves; some point in the causal future of the world line is also in its causal past, a situation that can be described as time travel. Such a solution was first proposed by Kurt G\u00f6del, a solution known as the G\u00f6del metric, but his (and others') solution requires the universe to have physical characteristics that it does not appear to have, such as rotation and lack of Hubble expansion. Whether general relativity forbids closed time-like curves for all realistic conditions is still being researched.\nWormholes.\nWormholes are a hypothetical warped spacetime permitted by the Einstein field equations of general relativity. A proposed time-travel machine using a traversable wormhole would hypothetically work in the following way: One end of the wormhole is accelerated to some significant fraction of the speed of light, perhaps with some advanced propulsion system, and then brought back to the point of origin. Alternatively, another way is to take one entrance of the wormhole and move it to within the gravitational field of an object that has higher gravity than the other entrance, and then return it to a position near the other entrance. For both these methods, time dilation causes the end of the wormhole that has been moved to have aged less, or become \"younger\", than the stationary end as seen by an external observer; however, time connects differently \"through\" the wormhole than \"outside\" it, so that synchronized clocks at either end of the wormhole will always remain synchronized as seen by an observer passing through the wormhole, no matter how the two ends move around. This means that an observer entering the \"younger\" end would exit the \"older\" end at a time when it was the same age as the \"younger\" end, effectively going back in time as seen by an observer from the outside. One significant limitation of such a time machine is that it is only possible to go as far back in time as the initial creation of the machine; in essence, it is more of a path through time than it is a device that itself moves through time, and it would not allow the technology itself to be moved backward in time.\nAccording to current theories on the nature of wormholes, construction of a traversable wormhole would require the existence of a substance with negative energy, often referred to as \"exotic matter\". More technically, the wormhole spacetime requires a distribution of energy that violates various energy conditions, such as the null energy condition along with the weak, strong, and dominant energy conditions. However, it is known that quantum effects can lead to small measurable violations of the null energy condition, and many physicists believe that the required negative energy may actually be possible due to the Casimir effect in quantum physics. Although early calculations suggested that a very large amount of negative energy would be required, later calculations showed that the amount of negative energy can be made arbitrarily small.\nIn 1993, Matt Visser argued that the two mouths of a wormhole with such an induced clock difference could not be brought together without inducing quantum field and gravitational effects that would either make the wormhole collapse or the two mouths repel each other. Because of this, the two mouths could not be brought close enough for causality violation to take place. However, in a 1997 paper, Visser hypothesized that a complex \"Roman ring\" (named after Tom Roman) configuration of an N number of wormholes arranged in a symmetric polygon could still act as a time machine, although he concludes that this is more likely a flaw in classical quantum gravity theory rather than proof that causality violation is possible.\nOther approaches based on general relativity.\nAnother approach involves a dense spinning cylinder usually referred to as a Tipler cylinder, a GR solution discovered by Willem Jacob van Stockum in 1936 and Kornel Lanczos in 1924, but not recognized as allowing closed timelike curves until an analysis by Frank Tipler in 1974. If a cylinder is infinitely long and spins fast enough about its long axis, then a spaceship flying around the cylinder on a spiral path could travel back in time (or forward, depending on the direction of its spiral). However, the density and speed required is so great that ordinary matter is not strong enough to construct it. \nA more fundamental objection to time travel schemes based on rotating cylinders or cosmic strings has been put forward by Stephen Hawking, who proved a theorem showing that according to general relativity it is impossible to build a time machine of a special type (a \"time machine with the compactly generated Cauchy horizon\") in a region where the weak energy condition is satisfied, meaning that the region contains no matter with negative energy density (exotic matter). Solutions such as Tipler's assume cylinders of infinite length, which are easier to analyze mathematically, and although Tipler suggested that a finite cylinder might produce closed timelike curves if the rotation rate were fast enough, he did not prove this. But Hawking points out that because of his theorem, \"it can't be done with positive energy density everywhere! I can prove that to build a finite time machine, you need negative energy.\" This result comes from Hawking's 1992 paper on the chronology protection conjecture, which Hawking states as \"The laws of physics do not allow the appearance of closed timelike curves.\"\nQuantum physics.\nNo-communication theorem.\nWhen a signal is sent from one location and received at another location, then as long as the signal is moving at the speed of light or slower, the mathematics of simultaneity in the theory of relativity show that all reference frames agree that the transmission-event happened before the reception-event. When the signal travels faster than light, it is received \"before\" it is sent, in all reference frames. The signal could be said to have moved backward in time. This hypothetical scenario is sometimes referred to as a tachyonic antitelephone.\nQuantum-mechanical phenomena such as quantum teleportation, the EPR paradox, or quantum entanglement might appear to create a mechanism that allows for faster-than-light (FTL) communication or time travel, and in fact some interpretations of quantum mechanics such as the Bohm interpretation presume that some information is being exchanged between particles instantaneously in order to maintain correlations between particles. This effect was referred to as \"spooky action at a distance\" by Einstein.\nNevertheless, the fact that causality is preserved in quantum mechanics is a rigorous result in modern quantum field theories, and therefore modern theories do not allow for time travel or FTL communication. In any specific instance where FTL has been claimed, more detailed analysis has proven that to get a signal, some form of classical communication must also be used. The no-communication theorem also gives a general proof that quantum entanglement cannot be used to transmit information faster than classical signals.\nInteracting many-worlds interpretation.\nA variation of Hugh Everett's many-worlds interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics provides a resolution to the grandfather paradox that involves the time traveler arriving in a different universe than the one they came from; it's been argued that since the traveler arrives in a different universe's history and not their own history, this is not \"genuine\" time travel. The accepted many-worlds interpretation suggests that all possible quantum events can occur in mutually exclusive histories. However, some variations allow different universes to interact. This concept is most often used in science-fiction, but some physicists such as David Deutsch have suggested that a time traveler should end up in a different history than the one he started from. On the other hand, Stephen Hawking has argued that even if the MWI is correct, we should expect each time traveler to experience a single self-consistent history, so that time travelers remain within their own world rather than traveling to a different one. The physicist Allen Everett argued that Deutsch's approach \"involves modifying fundamental principles of quantum mechanics; it certainly goes beyond simply adopting the MWI\". Everett also argues that even if Deutsch's approach is correct, it would imply that any macroscopic object composed of multiple particles would be split apart when traveling back in time through a wormhole, with different particles emerging in different worlds.\nExperimental results.\nCertain experiments carried out give the impression of reversed causality, but fail to show it under closer examination.\nThe delayed-choice quantum eraser experiment performed by Marlan Scully involves pairs of entangled photons that are divided into \"signal photons\" and \"idler photons\", with the signal photons emerging from one of two locations and their position later measured as in the double-slit experiment. Depending on how the idler photon is measured, the experimenter can either learn which of the two locations the signal photon emerged from or \"erase\" that information. Even though the signal photons can be measured before the choice has been made about the idler photons, the choice seems to retroactively determine whether or not an interference pattern is observed when one correlates measurements of idler photons to the corresponding signal photons. However, since interference can be observed only after the idler photons are measured and they are correlated with the signal photons, there is no way for experimenters to tell what choice will be made in advance just by looking at the signal photons, only by gathering classical information from the entire system; thus causality is preserved.\nThe experiment of Lijun Wang might also show causality violation since it made it possible to send packages of waves through a bulb of caesium gas in such a way that the package appeared to exit the bulb 62 nanoseconds before its entry, but a wave package is not a single well-defined object but rather a sum of multiple waves of different frequencies (see Fourier analysis), and the package can appear to move faster than light or even backward in time even if none of the pure waves in the sum do so. This effect cannot be used to send any matter, energy, or information faster than light, so this experiment is understood not to violate causality either.\nThe physicists G\u00fcnter Nimtz and Alfons Stahlhofen, of the University of Koblenz, claim to have violated Einstein's theory of relativity by transmitting photons faster than the speed of light. They say they have conducted an experiment in which microwave photons traveled \"instantaneously\" between a pair of prisms that had been moved up to apart, using a phenomenon known as quantum tunneling. Nimtz told \"New Scientist\" magazine: \"For the time being, this is the only violation of special relativity that I know of.\" However, other physicists say that this phenomenon does not allow information to be transmitted faster than light. Aephraim M. Steinberg, a quantum optics expert at the University of Toronto, Canada, uses the analogy of a train traveling from Chicago to New York, but dropping off train cars at each station along the way, so that the center of the train moves forward at each stop; in this way, the speed of the center of the train exceeds the speed of any of the individual cars.\nShengwang Du claims in a peer-reviewed journal to have observed single photons' precursors, saying that they travel no faster than \"c\" in a vacuum. His experiment involved slow light as well as passing light through a vacuum. He generated two single photons, passing one through rubidium atoms that had been cooled with a laser (thus slowing the light) and passing one through a vacuum. Both times, apparently, the precursors preceded the photons' main bodies, and the precursor traveled at \"c\" in a vacuum. According to Du, this implies that there is no possibility of light traveling faster than \"c\" and, thus, no possibility of violating causality.\nAbsence of time travelers from the future.\nMany have argued that the absence of time travelers from the future demonstrates that such technology will never be developed, suggesting that it is impossible. This is analogous to the Fermi paradox related to the absence of evidence of extraterrestrial life. As the absence of extraterrestrial visitors does not categorically \"prove\" they do not exist, so the absence of time travelers fails to prove time travel is physically impossible; it might be that time travel is physically possible but is never developed or is cautiously used. Carl Sagan once suggested the possibility that time travelers could be here but are disguising their existence or are not recognized as time travelers. Some interpretations of general relativity propose that time travel could only occur within specific conditions such as regions of spacetime affected by extreme gravitational fields or other distortions. In such scenarios, time travelers would be limited to moving within the period after such a region came into existence, and could not travel to a time before it formed. Stephen Hawking stated that this would explain why the world has not already been overrun by \"tourists from the future\".\nSeveral experiments have been carried out to try to entice future humans, who might invent time travel technology, to come back and demonstrate it to people of the present time. Events such as Perth's Destination Day, MIT's Time Traveler Convention and Stephen Hawking's Reception For Time Travellers heavily publicized permanent \"advertisements\" of a meeting time and place for future time travelers to meet. In 1982, a group in Baltimore, Maryland, identifying itself as the Krononauts, hosted an event of this type welcoming visitors from the future.\nThese experiments only stood the possibility of generating a positive result demonstrating the existence of time travel, but have failed so far\u2014no time travelers are known to have attended either event. Some versions of the many-worlds interpretation can be used to suggest that future humans have traveled back in time, but have traveled back to the meeting time and place in a parallel universe.\nTime dilation.\nThere is a great deal of observable evidence for time dilation in special relativity and gravitational time dilation in general relativity, for example in the famous and easy-to-replicate observation of atmospheric muon decay. The theory of relativity states that the speed of light is invariant for all observers in any frame of reference; that is, it is always the same. Time dilation is a direct consequence of the invariance of the speed of light. Time dilation may be regarded in a limited sense as \"time travel into the future\": a person may use time dilation so that a small amount of proper time passes for them, while a large amount of proper time passes elsewhere. This can be achieved by traveling at relativistic speeds or through the effects of gravity.\nFor two identical clocks moving relative to each other without accelerating, each clock measures the other to be ticking slower. This is possible due to the relativity of simultaneity. However, the symmetry is broken if one clock accelerates, allowing for less proper time to pass for one clock than the other. The twin paradox describes this: one twin remains on Earth, while the other undergoes acceleration to relativistic speed as they travel into space, turn around, and travel back to Earth; the traveling twin ages less than the twin who stayed on Earth, because of the time dilation experienced during their acceleration. General relativity treats the effects of acceleration and the effects of gravity as equivalent, and shows that time dilation also occurs in gravity wells, with a clock deeper in the well ticking more slowly; this effect is taken into account when calibrating the clocks on the satellites of the Global Positioning System, and it could lead to significant differences in rates of aging for observers at different distances from a large gravity well such as a black hole.\nA time machine that utilizes this principle might be, for instance, a spherical shell with a diameter of five meters and the mass of Jupiter. A person at its center will travel forward in time at a rate four times slower than that of distant observers. Squeezing the mass of a large planet into such a small structure is not expected to be within humanity's technological capabilities in the near future. With current technologies, it is only possible to cause a human traveler to age less than companions on Earth by a few milliseconds after a few hundred days of space travel.\nPhilosophy.\nPhilosophers have discussed the philosophy of space and time since at least the time of ancient Greece; for example, Parmenides presented the view that time is an illusion. Centuries later, Isaac Newton supported the idea of absolute time, while his contemporary Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz maintained that time is only a relation between events and it cannot be expressed independently. The latter approach eventually gave rise to the spacetime of relativity.\nPresentism vs. eternalism.\nMany philosophers have argued that relativity implies eternalism, the idea that the past and future exist in a real sense, not only as changes that occurred or will occur to the present. Philosopher of science Dean Rickles disagrees with some qualifications, but notes that \"the consensus among philosophers seems to be that special and general relativity are incompatible with presentism\". Some philosophers view time as a dimension equal to spatial dimensions, that future events are \"already there\" in the same sense different places exist, and that there is no objective flow of time; however, this view is disputed.\nPresentism is a school of philosophy that holds that the future and the past exist only as changes that occurred or will occur to the present, and they have no real existence of their own. In this view, time travel is impossible because there is no future or past to travel to. Keller and Nelson have argued that even if past and future objects do not exist, there can still be definite truths about past and future events, and thus it is possible that a future truth about a time traveler deciding to travel back to the present date could explain the time traveler's actual appearance in the present; these views are contested by some authors.\nThe grandfather paradox.\nA common objection to the idea of traveling back in time is put forth in the grandfather paradox or the argument of auto-infanticide. If one were able to go back in time, inconsistencies and contradictions would ensue if the time traveler were to change anything; there is a contradiction if the past becomes different from the way it \"is\". The paradox is commonly described with a person who travels to the past and kills their own grandfather, prevents the existence of their father or mother, and therefore their own existence. Philosophers question whether these paradoxes prove time travel impossible. Some philosophers answer these paradoxes by arguing that it might be the case that backward time travel could be possible but that it would be impossible to actually \"change\" the past in any way, an idea similar to the proposed Novikov self-consistency principle in physics.\nOntological paradox.\nCompossibility.\nAccording to the philosophical theory of compossibility, what \"can\" happen, for example in the context of time travel, must be weighed against the context of everything relating to the situation. If the past \"is\" a certain way, it's not possible for it to be any other way. What \"can\" happen when a time traveler visits the past is limited to what \"did\" happen, in order to prevent logical contradictions.\nSelf-consistency principle.\nThe Novikov self-consistency principle, named after Igor Dmitrievich Novikov, states that any actions taken by a time traveler or by an object that travels back in time were part of history all along, and therefore it is impossible for the time traveler to \"change\" history in any way. The time traveler's actions may be the \"cause\" of events in their own past though, which leads to the potential for circular causation, sometimes called a predestination paradox, ontological paradox, or bootstrap paradox. The term bootstrap paradox was popularized by Robert A. Heinlein's story \"By His Bootstraps\". The Novikov self-consistency principle proposes that the local laws of physics in a region of spacetime containing time travelers cannot be any different from the local laws of physics in any other region of spacetime.\nThe philosopher Kelley L. Ross argues in \"Time Travel Paradoxes\" that in a scenario involving a physical object whose world-line or history forms a closed loop in time there can be a violation of the second law of thermodynamics. Ross uses the film \"Somewhere in Time\" as an example of such an ontological paradox, where a watch is given to a person, and 60 years later the same watch is brought back in time and given to the same character. Ross states that entropy of the watch will increase, and the watch carried back in time will be more worn with each repetition of its history. The second law of thermodynamics is understood by modern physicists to be a statistical law, so decreasing entropy and non-increasing entropy are not impossible, just improbable. Additionally, entropy statistically increases in systems which are isolated, so non-isolated systems, such as an object, that interact with the outside world, can become less worn and decrease in entropy, and it's possible for an object whose world-line forms a closed loop to be always in the same condition in the same point of its history.\nIn 2005, Daniel Greenberger and Karl Svozil proposed that quantum theory gives a model for time travel where the past must be self-consistent.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "31593", "revid": "49712780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31593", "title": "Tours", "text": "City in Centre-Val de Loire, France\nTours ( ; ) is the largest city in the region of Centre-Val de Loire, France. It is the prefecture of the department of Indre-et-Loire. The commune of Tours had 136,463 inhabitants as of 2018 while the population of the whole metropolitan area was 516,973.\nTours sits on the lower reaches of the Loire, between Orl\u00e9ans and the Atlantic coast. Formerly named Caesarodunum by its founder, Roman Emperor Augustus, it possesses one of the largest amphitheaters of the Roman Empire, the Tours Amphitheatre. Known for the Battle of Tours in 732 AD, it is a National Sanctuary with connections to the Merovingians and the Carolingians, with the Capetians making the kingdom's currency the Livre tournois. Saint Martin and Gregory of Tours were from Tours. Tours was once part of Touraine, a former province of France. Tours was the first city of the silk industry. It was taken by Louis XI, as the royal capital under the Valois Kings with its Loire castles and city of art with the School of Tours. The prefecture was partially destroyed during the French Wars of Religion in the late 16th century and again during the Second World War in June 1940.\nThe White and Blue city keeps a historical centre registered in the UNESCO, and is home to the Vieux-Tours, a patrimonial site. The garden city has a green heritage and its urban landscape has been strongly influenced by its natural space. The historic city is nicknamed \"Le Petit Paris\". The city is a university city with more than 30,000 students in 2019. Tours is a popular culinary city with specialties such as: rillettes, rillons, Touraine vineyards, AOC Sainte-Maure-de-Touraine cheeses and nougats. The city is also the end-point of the annual Paris\u2013Tours cycle race. The region, due to its history and culture, has always been a land of birth or host to many personalities and international sporting events.\nEtymology.\nA popular folk etymology of the word \"Tours\" is that it comes from \"Turonus\", the nephew of Brutus. Turonus died in a war between Corineus and the king of Aquitaine, Goffarius Pictus, provoked by Corineus hunting in the king's forests without permission. It is said that Turonus was buried in Tours and the city is founded around his grave.\nHistory.\nIn Gallic times, Tours was an important crossing point over the Loire. It became part of the Roman Empire during the 1st century AD, and the city was named \"\" (\"hill of Caesar\"). The name evolved in the 4th century when the original Gallic name, Turones, became \"Civitas Turonum\" and then \"Tours\". It was at this time that the Tours Amphitheatre was built.\nTours became a metropolis in the Roman province of Lugdunum towards 380\u2013388 AD, dominating Maine, Brittany, and the Loire Valley. One important figure in the city was Saint Martin of Tours, a bishop who shared his coat with a naked beggar in Amiens. The importance of Martin in the medieval Christian West made Tours, and its position on the route of pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, a major centre during the Middle Ages.\nMiddle Ages.\nIn the 6th century, Gregory of Tours, author of the \"Ten Books of History\", restored a cathedral destroyed by a fire in 561. Saint Martin's monastery benefited from its inception, at the very start of the 6th century from patronage and support from the Frankish king, Clovis I, which increased considerably the influence of the saint, the abbey and the city in Gaul. In the 9th century, Tours was at the heart of the Carolingian Renaissance, in particular because of Alcuin, of York in Northumbria, a renowned book collector and an abbot of Marmoutier Abbey.\nIn 732, Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi and an army of Muslim horsemen from Al-Andalus advanced deep into France, and were stopped at the Battle of Tours at Moussais-la-Bataille (between Ch\u00e2tellerault and Poitiers) by Charles Martel and his infantry. The Muslim army was defeated, preventing an Islamic conquest of France.\nIn 845, Tours repelled the first attack of the Viking chief Haesten. In 850, the Vikings settled at the mouths of the Seine and the Loire. Still led by Haesten, they went up the Loire again in 852 and sacked Angers, Tours and Marmoutier Abbey.\nDuring the Middle Ages, Tours consisted of two juxtaposed and competing centres. The \"City\" in the east, successor of the late Roman 'castrum', was composed of the cathedral and palace of the archbishops as well as the castle of Tours. The castle of Tours acted as a seat of the authority of the Counts of Tours (later Counts of Anjou) and the King of France. In the west, the \"new city\" structured around the Abbey of Saint Martin was freed from the control of the city during the 10th century (an enclosure was built towards 918) and became \"Ch\u00e2teauneuf\". This space, organized between Saint Martin and the Loire, became the economic centre of Tours. Between these two centres were Varennes, vineyards and fields, little occupied except for the Abbaye Saint-Julien established on the banks of the Loire. The two centres were linked during the 14th century.\nTours became the capital of the county of Tours or Touraine, a territory bitterly disputed between the counts of Blois and Anjou \u2013 the latter were victorious in the 11th century. It was the capital of France at the time of Louis XI, who had settled in the castle of Montils (today the castle of Plessis-les-Tours, at the junction of the Loire and the Indre rivers). Tours and Touraine remained a permanent residence of the kings and court until the 16th century. The Renaissance gave Tours and Touraine many private mansions and castles, joined to some extent under the generic name of the Ch\u00e2teaux of the Loire. It is also at the time of Louis XI that the silk industry was introduced \u2013 despite difficulties, the industry still survives to this day.\n16th\u201318th centuries.\nCharles IX passed through the city at the time of his royal tour of France between 1564 and 1566, accompanied by the Court and various noblemen: his brother the Duke of Anjou, Henri de Navarre, the cardinals of Bourbon and Lorraine. At this time, the Catholics returned to power in Angers: the attendant assumed the right to nominate the aldermen. The Massacre of Saint-Barthelemy was not repeated at Tours. The Protestants were imprisoned by the aldermen \u2013 a measure which prevented their extermination. The permanent return of the Court to Paris and then Versailles marked the beginning of a slow but permanent decline. Guillaume the Metayer (1763\u20131798), known as Rochambeau, the well-known counter-revolutionary chief of Mayenne, was shot in Tours.\n19th to 20th centuries.\nThe arrival of the railway in the 19th century saved the city by making it an important nodal point. The main railway station is known as Tours-Saint-Pierre-des-Corps. At that time, Tours was expanding towards the south into a district known as the Pr\u00e9bendes. The importance of the city as a centre of communications contributed to its revival and, as the 20th century progressed, Tours became a dynamic conurbation, economically oriented towards the service sector. The city was briefly the \"de facto\" capital of France during the Franco-Prussian War playing host to L\u00e9on Gambetta and representatives of the Government of National Defence who escaped the then ongoing Siege of Paris.\nFirst World War.\nThe city was greatly affected by the First World War. A force of 25,000 American soldiers arrived in 1917, setting up textile factories for the manufacture of uniforms, repair shops for military equipment, munitions dumps, an army post office and an American military hospital at Augustins. Because of this, Tours became a garrison town with a resident general staff. The American presence is remembered today by the Wilson Bridge over the Loire, which was officially opened in July 1918 and bears the name of the President of the United States from 1913 to 1921. Three American air force squadrons, including the 492nd, were based at the Par\u00e7ay-Meslay airfield, their personnel playing an active part in the life of the city. Americans paraded at funerals and award ceremonies for the Croix de Guerre. They also took part in festivals and their YMCA organised shows for the troops. Some men married women from Tours.\nInter-war years.\nIn 1920, the city hosted the Congress of Tours, which saw the creation of the French Communist Party. One future consequence of that congress was the presence of Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese nationalist, who became one of the first members of the party.\nSecond World War.\nTours was also marked by the Second World War, as the city suffered massive destruction in 1940. For four years it was a city of military camps and fortifications. From 10 to 13 June 1940, Tours was the temporary seat of the French government before its move to Bordeaux.\nGerman incendiary bombs caused a huge fire, which blazed out of control from 20 to 22 June and destroyed part of the city centre. Some architectural masterpieces of the 16th and 17th centuries were lost, as was the monumental entry to the city. The Wilson Bridge, which carried a water main that supplied the city, was dynamited to slow the progress of the German advance. With the water main severed, nobody could extinguish the inferno. That made inhabitants have no option but to flee to safety. More heavy air raids by Allied forces devastated the area around the railway station in 1944, causing several hundred deaths.\nPost-war developments.\nA plan for the rebuilding of the central area drawn up by the local architect Camille Lef\u00e8vre had been adopted even before the end of the war. The plan was for 20 small quadrangular blocks of housing to be arranged around the main road (la rue Nationale), which was widened. This regular layout attempted to echo but simplify the 18th-century architecture. Pierre Patout succeeded Lef\u00e8vre as the architect in charge of rebuilding in 1945. At one time, there was talk of demolishing the southern side of the rue Nationale to make it in keeping with the new development.\nThe recent history of Tours is marked by the personality of Jean Royer, who was mayor for 36 years and helped save the old town from demolition by establishing one of the first Conservation Areas. This example of conservation policy would later inspire the Malraux Law for the safeguarding of historic city centres. In the 1970s, Jean Royer also extended the city to the south by diverting the course of the Cher River to create the districts of Rives du Cher and des Fontaines. At the time, it was one of the largest urban developments in Europe. In 1970, the Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais University was founded and centred on the bank of the Loire in the downtown area, not, as was the current practice, in a campus in the suburbs. The latter solution was also chosen by the twin university of Orleans. Royer's long term as mayor was, however, not without controversy, as is exemplified by the construction of the practical but aesthetically unattractive motorway, which runs along the bed of a former canal just from the cathedral. Another bone of contention was the original Vinci Congress Centre by Jean Nouvel. The project incurred debts although it at least made Tours one of France's principal conference centres.\nJean Germain, a member of the Socialist Party, became mayor in 1995 and made debt reduction his priority. Ten years later, his economic management was regarded as much wiser than that of his predecessor because of the financial stability of the city returning. However, his achievements were criticised by the municipal opposition for a lack of ambition. There were no large building projects instituted under his two terms. That position is disputed by those in power, who affirm their policy of concentrating on the quality of life, as evidenced by urban restoration, the development of public transport and cultural activities.\nClimate.\nTours has an oceanic climate that is very mild for such a northern latitude. Summers are influenced by its inland position, resulting in frequent days of or warmer, whereas winters are kept mild by Atlantic air masses. The entire valley between Orlans and Angers is famous for the luminosity of its air and for its fabulous ch\u00e2teaux, most of them Renaissance (over 600 between Orlans and Angers).\nSights.\nCathedral.\nThe Cathedral of Tours, dedicated to Saint Gatien, its canonized first bishop, was begun about 1170 to replace the cathedral that was burnt out in 1166 during the dispute between Louis VII of France and Henry II of England. The lowermost stages of the western towers belong to the 12th century, but the rest of the west end is in the profusely detailed 15th-century Flamboyant Gothic, which were completed just as the Renaissance was affecting the patrons who planned the ch\u00e2teaux of Touraine. The towers were being constructed at the same time as, for example, the Ch\u00e2teau de Chenonceau.\nWhen the 15th-century illuminator Jean Fouquet was set the task of illuminating Josephus's \"Jewish Antiquities\", his depiction of Solomon's Temple was modelled on the nearly complete cathedral of Tours. The atmosphere of the Gothic cathedral close permeates Honor\u00e9 de Balzac's dark short novel of jealousy and provincial intrigues, \"Le Cur\u00e9 de Tours\" (\"The Curate of Tours\") and his medieval story \"Ma\u00eetre Corn\u00e9lius\" opens in the cathedral itself.\nLanguage.\nBefore the French Revolution, the inhabitants of Tours (\"Les Tourangeaux\") were known for speaking the \"purest\" form of French in the entire country. The pronunciation of Touraine was traditionally regarded as the most standard pronunciation of the French language, until the 19th century when the standard pronunciation of French shifted to that of the Parisian bourgeoisie. That is explained by the fact that the court of France lived in Touraine between 1430 and 1530. French, the language of the court, had become the official language of the entire kingdom.\nA Council of Tours in 813 decided that priests should preach sermons in different languages because the common people could no longer understand classical Latin. This was the first official recognition of an early French language distinct from Latin, and can be considered as the birth of French.\nThe Ordinance of Montils-l\u00e8s-Tours, promulgated by Charles VII in 1454, made it mandatory to write laws and oral customs in the native language of the area.\nAn ordinance of Charles VIII (born in Amboise, near Tours) in 1490 and one of Louis XII (born in Blois, near Tours) in 1510 broaden the scope of the ordinance of Charles VII.\nFinally, the Ordinance of Villers-Cotter\u00eats, signed into law by Francis I in 1539, called for the use of French in all legal acts, notarized contracts and official legislation to avoid any linguistic confusion.\nGregory of Tours wrote in the 6th century that some people in the area could still speak Gaulish.\nCity.\nThe city has a population of 140,000 and is called \"Le Jardin de la France\" (\"The Garden of France\"). There are several parks located within the city. Tours is located between two rivers, the Loire to the north and the Cher to the south. The buildings of Tours are white with blue slate (called \"Ardoise\") roofs; this style is common in the north of France, while most buildings in the south of France have terracotta roofs.\nTours is famous for its original medieval district, called \"le Vieux Tours\". Unique to the Old City are its preserved half-timbered buildings and \"la Place Plumereau\", a square with busy pubs and restaurants, whose open-air tables fill the centre of the square. The Boulevard Beranger crosses the Rue Nationale at the Place Jean-Jaures and is the location of weekly markets and fairs.\nTours is famous for its many bridges crossing the river Loire. One of them, Wilson Bridge, collapsed in 1978 but was rebuilt.\nIn the garden of the ancient Palais des Archev\u00eaques (now \"Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts\") is a huge cedar tree said to have been planted by Napoleon. The garden also has a stuffed elephant named Fritz. He escaped from the Barnum and Bailey circus during their stay in Tours in 1902. He went mad and had to be shot down, but the city paid to honor him, and he was taxidermied as a result.\nTours is home to University of Tours (formerly known as University Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais of Tours), the site of one of the most important choral competitions, called \"Floril\u00e8ge Vocal de Tours\" International Choir Competition, and is a member city of the European Grand Prix for Choral Singing.\nPopulation.\nThe population data in the table and graph below refer to the commune of Tours proper, in its geography at the given years. The commune of Tours absorbed the former commune of Saint-\u00c9tienne in 1845 and Sainte-Radegonde-en-Touraine and Saint-Symphorien in 1964.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTransportation.\nToday, with extensive rail (including TGV) and \"autoroute\" connections linking to the rest of the country, Tours is a jumping-off point for tourist visits to the Loire Valley and the royal ch\u00e2teaux.\nTours is on one of the main lines of the TGV. It is possible to travel to the west coast of Bordeaux in an hour and forty minutes. From there, the line follows the Mediterranean coast via Avignon, and then to Spain and Barcelona. There are also lines to Lyon, Strasbourg and Lille. It takes less than one hour by train to get from Tours to Paris by TGV and one and a half hours to get to Charles de Gaulle Airport. Tours has two main stations: Gare de Tours, the central station, and Gare de Saint-Pierre-des-Corps, used by trains that do not terminate in Tours.\nTours Loire Valley Airport connects the Loire Valley to European cities.\nHistorically, Tours was served by trams and trolleybuses, the trolleybus system lasting from 1949 to 1968. Tram service returned to the city in 2013, when a new tram system began operation. Twenty-one Alstom Citadis trams were ordered.\nThere is also a bus service, the main central stop being \"Jean Jaur\u00e8s\", next to the H\u00f4tel de Ville, and \"rue Nationale\", the high street of Tours. The tram and bus networks are operated by Fil Bleu and they share a ticketing system. A second tram line is scheduled for 2025.\nSport.\nThe city's premier football club, Tours FC, was dissolved in 2025, after 106 years of activity, due to years of financial struggles. They also have a second team, CCSP Tours. CCSP's home stadium is the Stade des Tourettes and they play in the Division d'Honneur Regionale de Centre, the seventh tier of the French football league system.\nTours has served as the finish location for Paris\u2013Tours, a one-day road cycling classic race held almost every October since 1896.\nTours also has a volleyball club named the Tours VB.\nCatholics from Tours.\nTours is a special place for Catholics who follow the devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus and the adoration of the Blessed Sacrament. In 1843, Sister Marie of St Peter of Tours reported a vision which started the devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus, in reparation for the many insults Christ suffered in His Passion. The \"Golden Arrow Prayer\" was first made public by her.\nThe Venerable Leo Dupont also known as The Holy Man of Tours lived in Tours at about the same time. In 1849 he started the nightly adoration of the Blessed Sacrament, which spread throughout France. Upon hearing of Sister Marie of St Peter's reported visions, he started to burn a vigil lamp continuously before a picture of the Holy Face of Jesus. The devotion was eventually approved by Pope Pius XII in 1958 and he formally declared the Feast of the Holy Face of Jesus as Shrove Tuesday (the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday) for all Roman Catholics. The Oratory of the Holy Face on Rue St. \u00c9tienne in Tours receives many pilgrims every year.\nTours was the site of the episcopal activity of St. Martin of Tours and has further Christian connotations in that the pivotal Battle of Tours in 732 is often considered the first decisive victory over the invading Islamic forces, turning the tide against them. The battle also helped lay the foundations of the Carolingian Empire.\nTwin towns \u2014 sister cities.\nTours is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Symptoms vary from mild to severe, and usually begin six to 30 days after exposure. Often there is a gradual onset of a high fever over several days. This is commonly accompanied by weakness, abdominal pain, constipation, headaches, and mild vomiting. Some people develop a skin rash with rose colored spots. In severe cases, people may experience confusion. Without treatment, symptoms may last weeks or months. Diarrhea may be severe, but is uncommon. Other people may carry it without being affected, but are still contagious. Typhoid fever is a type of enteric fever, along with paratyphoid fever. \"Salmonella enterica\" Typhi is believed to infect and replicate only within humans.\nTyphoid is caused by the bacterium \"Salmonella enterica\" subsp. \"enterica\" serovar Typhi growing in the intestines, Peyer's patches, mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, liver, gallbladder, bone marrow and blood. Typhoid is spread by eating or drinking food or water contaminated with the feces of an infected person. Risk factors include limited access to clean drinking water and poor sanitation. Those who have not yet been exposed to it and ingest contaminated drinking water or food are most at risk for developing symptoms. Only humans can be infected; there are no known animal reservoirs. Salmonella typhi which causes typhoid fever is different from the other \"Salmonella\" bacteria that usually cause salmonellosis, a common type of food poisoning.\nDiagnosis is performed by culturing and identifying \"S. typhi\" from patient samples or detecting an immune response to the pathogen from blood samples. Recently, new advances in large-scale data collection and analysis have allowed researchers to develop better diagnostics, such as detecting changing abundances of small molecules in the blood that may specifically indicate typhoid fever. Diagnostic tools in regions where typhoid is most prevalent are quite limited in their accuracy and specificity, and the time required for a proper diagnosis, the increasing spread of antibiotic resistance, and the cost of testing are also hardships for under-resourced healthcare systems.\nA typhoid vaccine can prevent about 40\u201390% of cases during the first two years. The vaccine may have some effect for up to seven years. For those at high risk or people traveling to areas where it is common, vaccination is recommended. Other efforts to prevent it include providing clean drinking water, good sanitation, and handwashing. Until an infection is confirmed as cleared, the infected person should not prepare food for others. Typhoid is treated with antibiotics such as azithromycin, fluoroquinolones, or third-generation cephalosporins. Resistance to these antibiotics has been developing, which has made treatment more difficult.\nIn 2015, 12.5 million new typhoid cases were reported. The disease is most common in India. Children are most commonly affected. Typhoid decreased in the developed world in the 1940s as a result of improved sanitation and the use of antibiotics. Every year about 400 cases are reported in the U.S. and an estimated 6,000 people have typhoid. In 2015, it resulted in about 149,000 deaths worldwide \u2013 down from 181,000 in 1990. Without treatment, the risk of death may be as high as 20%. With treatment, it is between 1% and 4%.\nTyphus is a different disease, caused by unrelated species of bacteria. Owing to their similar symptoms, they were not recognized as distinct diseases until the 1800s. \"Typhoid\" means \"resembling typhus\".\nSigns and symptoms.\nClassically, the progression of untreated typhoid fever has three distinct stages, each lasting about a week. Over the course of these stages, the patient becomes exhausted and emaciated.\nCauses.\nBacteria.\nThe Gram-negative bacterium that causes typhoid fever is \"Salmonella enterica\" subsp. enterica serovar Typhi. Based on the MLST subtyping scheme, the two main sequence types of the \"S.\" Typhi are ST1 and ST2, which are widespread globally. Global phylogeographical analysis showed dominance of a haplotype 58 (H58), which probably originated in India during the late 1980s and is now spreading through the world with multi-drug resistance. A more detailed genotyping scheme was reported in 2016 and is now widely used. This scheme reclassified the nomenclature of H58 to genotype 4.3.1.\nTransmission.\nUnlike other strains of \"Salmonella\", humans are the only known typhoid carriers. \"S. enterica\" subsp. enterica serovar Typhi is spread by the fecal-oral route from people who are infected and from asymptomatic carriers of the bacterium. An asymptomatic human carrier is someone who is still excreting typhoid bacteria in stool a year after the acute stage of the infection.\nDiagnosis.\nDiagnosis is made by any blood, bone marrow, or stool cultures and with the Widal test (demonstration of antibodies against \"Salmonella\" antigens O-somatic and H-flagellar). In epidemics and less wealthy countries, after excluding malaria, dysentery, or pneumonia, a therapeutic trial time with chloramphenicol is generally undertaken while awaiting the results of the Widal test and blood and stool cultures.\nWidal test.\nThe Widal test is used to identify specific antibodies in the serum of people with typhoid by using antigen-antibody interactions.\nIn this test, the serum is mixed with a dead bacterial suspension of \"Salmonella\" with specific antigens. If the patient's serum contains antibodies against those antigens, they get attached to them, forming clumps. If clumping does not occur, the test is negative. The Widal test is time-consuming and prone to significant false positives. It may also be falsely negative in recently infected people. But unlike the Typhidot test, the Widal test quantifies the specimen with titres.\nRapid diagnostic tests.\nRapid diagnostic tests such as Tubex, Typhidot, and Test-It have shown moderate diagnostic accuracy.\nTyphidot.\nTyphidot is based on the presence of specific IgM and IgG antibodies to a specific 50Kd OMP antigen. This test is carried out on a cellulose nitrate membrane where a specific \"S. typhi\" outer membrane protein is attached as fixed test lines. It separately identifies IgM and IgG antibodies. IgM shows recent infection; IgG signifies remote infection.\nThe sample pad of this kit contains colloidal gold-anti-human IgG or gold-anti-human IgM. If the sample contains IgG and IgM antibodies against those antigens, they will react and turn red. The typhidot test becomes positive within 2\u20133 days of infection.\nTwo colored bands indicate a positive test. A single control band indicates a negative test. A single first fixed line or no band at all indicates an invalid test. Typhidot's biggest limitation is that it is not quantitative, just positive or negative.\nTubex test.\nThe Tubex test contains two types of particles: brown magnetic particles coated with antigen and blue indicator particles coated with O9 antibody. During the test, if antibodies are present in the serum, they will attach to the brown magnetic particles and settle at the base, while the blue indicator particles remain in the solution, producing a blue color, which means the test is positive.\nIf the serum does not have an antibody in it, the blue particles attach to the brown particles and settle at the bottom, producing a colorless solution, which means the test is negative.\nPrevention.\nSanitation and hygiene are important to prevent typhoid. It can spread only in environments where human feces can come into contact with food or drinking water. Careful food preparation and washing of hands are crucial to prevent typhoid. Industrialization contributed greatly to the elimination of typhoid fever, as it eliminated the public health hazards associated with having horse manure in public streets, which led to a large number of flies, which are vectors of many pathogens, including \"Salmonella\" spp. According to statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the chlorination of drinking water has led to dramatic decreases in the transmission of typhoid fever.\nVaccination.\nTwo typhoid vaccines are licensed for use in the prevention of typhoid: the live, oral Ty21a vaccine (sold as Vivotif by Crucell Switzerland AG) and the injectable typhoid polysaccharide vaccine (sold as Typhim Vi by Sanofi Pasteur and Typherix by GlaxoSmithKline). Both are efficacious and recommended for travelers to areas where typhoid is endemic. Boosters are recommended every five years for the oral vaccine and every two years for the injectable form. An older, killed whole-cell vaccine is still used in countries where the newer preparations are not available, but this vaccine is no longer recommended for use because it has more side effects (mainly pain and inflammation at the site of the injection).\nTo help decrease rates of typhoid fever in developing nations, the World Health Organization (WHO) endorsed the use of a vaccination program starting in 1999. Vaccination has proven effective at controlling outbreaks in high-incidence areas and is also very cost-effective: prices are normally less than US$1 per dose. Because the price is low, poverty-stricken communities are more willing to take advantage of the vaccinations. Although vaccination programs for typhoid have proven effective, they alone cannot eliminate typhoid fever. Combining vaccines with public health efforts is the only proven way to control this disease.\nSince the 1990s, the WHO has recommended two typhoid fever vaccines. The ViPS vaccine is given by injection and the Ty21a by capsules. Only people over age two are recommended to be vaccinated with the ViPS vaccine, and it requires a revaccination after 2\u20133 years, with a 55\u201372% efficacy. The Ty21a vaccine is recommended for people five and older, lasting 5\u20137 years with 51\u201367% efficacy. The two vaccines have proved safe and effective for epidemic disease control in multiple regions.\nA version of the vaccine combined with a hepatitis A vaccine is also available.\nResults of a phase 3 trial of typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV) in December 2019 reported 81% fewer cases among children.\nTreatment.\nTreatment for typhoid fever is most effective if started early.\nOral rehydration therapy.\nThe rediscovery of oral rehydration therapy in the 1960s provided a simple way to prevent many of the deaths of diarrheal diseases in general.\nAntibiotics.\nWhere resistance is uncommon, the treatment of choice is a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin. Otherwise, a third-generation cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone or cefotaxime is the first choice. Cefixime is a suitable oral alternative.\nProperly treated, typhoid fever is not fatal in most cases. Antibiotics such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin, and ciprofloxacin have been commonly used to treat it. Treatment with antibiotics reduces the case-fatality rate to about 1%.\nWithout treatment, some patients develop sustained fever, bradycardia, hepatosplenomegaly, abdominal symptoms, and occasionally pneumonia. In white-skinned patients, pink spots, which fade on pressure, appear on the skin of the trunk in up to 20% of cases. In the third week, untreated cases may develop gastrointestinal and cerebral complications, which may prove fatal in 10\u201320% of cases. The highest case fatality rates are reported in children under 4. Around 2\u20135% of those who contract typhoid fever become chronic carriers, as bacteria persist in the biliary tract after symptoms have resolved.\nSurgery.\nSurgery is usually indicated if intestinal perforation occurs. One study found a 30-day mortality rate of 9% (8/88), and surgical site infections at 67% (59/88), with the disease burden borne predominantly by low-resource countries.\nFor surgical treatment, most surgeons prefer simple closure of the perforation with drainage of the peritoneum. Small bowel resection is indicated for patients with multiple perforations. If antibiotic treatment fails to eradicate the hepatobiliary carriage, the gallbladder should be resected. Cholecystectomy is sometimes successful, especially in patients with gallstones, but is not always successful in eradicating the carrier state because of persisting hepatic infection.\nResistance.\nAs resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and streptomycin is now common, these agents are no longer used as first-line treatment of typhoid fever. Typhoid resistant to these agents is known as multidrug-resistant typhoid.\nCiprofloxacin resistance is an increasing problem, especially in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. Many centres are shifting from ciprofloxacin to ceftriaxone as the first line for treating suspected typhoid originating in South America, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Thailand, or Vietnam. Also, it has been suggested that azithromycin is better at treating resistant typhoid than both fluoroquinolone drugs and ceftriaxone. Azithromycin can be taken by mouth and is less expensive than ceftriaxone, which is given by injection.\nA separate problem exists with laboratory testing for reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin; current recommendations are that isolates should be tested simultaneously against ciprofloxacin (CIP) and against nalidixic acid (NAL), that isolates sensitive to both CIP and NAL should be reported as \"sensitive to ciprofloxacin\", and that isolates sensitive to CIP but not to NAL should be reported as \"reduced sensitivity to ciprofloxacin\". But an analysis of 271 isolates found that around 18% of isolates with reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones, the class to which CIP belongs (MIC 0.125\u20131.0\u00a0mg/L), would not be detected by this method.\nEpidemiology.\nIn 2000, typhoid fever caused an estimated 21.7 million illnesses and 217,000 deaths. It occurs most often in children and young adults between 5 and 19 years old. In 2013, it resulted in about 161,000 deaths \u2013 down from 181,000 in 1990. Infants, children, and adolescents in south-central and Southeast Asia have the highest rates of typhoid. Outbreaks are also often reported in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. In 2000, more than 90% of morbidity and mortality due to typhoid fever occurred in Asia. In the U.S., about 400 cases occur each year, 75% of which are acquired while traveling internationally.\nBefore the antibiotic era, the case fatality rate of typhoid fever was 10\u201320%. Today, with prompt treatment, it is less than 1%, but 3\u20135% of people who are infected develop a chronic infection in the gall bladder. Since \"S. enterica\" subsp. enterica serovar Typhi is human-restricted, these chronic carriers become the crucial reservoir, which can persist for decades for further spread of the disease, further complicating its identification and treatment. Lately, the study of \"S. enterica\" subsp. enterica serovar Typhi associated with a large outbreak and a carrier at the genome level provides new insight into the pathogenesis of the pathogen.\nIn industrialized nations, water sanitation and food handling improvements have reduced the number of typhoid cases. Third world nations have the highest rates. People in these areas often lack access to clean water, proper sanitation systems, and proper healthcare facilities. In these areas, such access to basic public-health needs is not expected in the near future.\nIn 2004\u20132005, an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo resulted in more than 42,000 cases and 214 deaths. Since November 2016, Pakistan has had an outbreak of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) typhoid fever.\nIn Europe, a report based on data for 2017 retrieved from The European Surveillance System (TESSy) on the distribution of confirmed typhoid and paratyphoid fever cases found that 22 EU/EEA countries reported a total of 1,098 cases, 90.9% of which were travel-related, mainly acquired during travel to South Asia.\nHistory.\nEarly descriptions.\nThe plague of Athens, during the Peloponnesian War, was most likely an outbreak of typhoid fever. During the war, Athenians retreated into a walled-in city to escape attack from the Spartans. This massive influx of humans into a concentrated space overwhelmed the water supply and waste infrastructure, likely leading to unsanitary conditions as fresh water became harder to obtain and waste became more difficult to collect and remove beyond the city walls. In 2006, examining the remains of a mass burial site from Athens from around the time of the plague (~430 B.C.) revealed that fragments of DNA similar to that of modern-day \"S.\" Typhi were detected, whereas \"Yersinia pestis\" (plague), \"Rickettsia prowazekii\" (typhus), \"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\", cowpox virus, and \"Bartonella henselae\" were not detected in any of the remains tested.\nDefinition and evidence of transmission.\nThe French doctors Pierre-Fidele Bretonneau and Pierre-Charles-Alexandre Louis are credited with describing typhoid fever as a specific disease, unique from typhus. Both doctors performed autopsies on individuals who died in Paris due to fever \u2013 and indicated that many had lesions on the Peyer's patches which correlated with distinct symptoms before death. British medics were skeptical of the differentiation between typhoid and typhus because both were endemic to Britain at that time. However, in France, only typhoid was present circulating in the population. Pierre-Charlles-Alexandre Louis also performed case studies and statistical analysis to demonstrate that typhoid was contagious \u2013 and that persons who already had the disease seemed to be protected. Afterward, several American doctors confirmed these findings, and then Sir William Jenner convinced any remaining skeptics that typhoid is a specific disease recognizable by lesions in the Peyer's patches by examining sixty-six autopsies from fever patients and concluding that the symptoms of headaches, diarrhea, rash spots, and abdominal pain were present only in patients who were found to have intestinal lesions after death; these observations solidified the association of the disease with the intestinal tract and gave the first clue to the route of transmission.\nIn 1847, William Budd learned of an epidemic of typhoid fever in Clifton, and identified that all 13 of 34 residents who had contracted the disease drew their drinking water from the same well. Notably, this observation was two years before John Snow first published an early version of his theory that contaminated water was the central conduit for transmitting cholera. Budd later became health officer of Bristol ensured a clean water supply, and documented further evidence of typhoid as a water-borne illness throughout his career.\nCause.\nPolish scientist Tadeusz Browicz described a short bacillus in the organs and feces of typhoid victims in 1874. Browicz was able to isolate and grow the bacilli but did not go as far as to insinuate or prove that they caused the disease.\nIn April 1880, three months before Eberth's publication, Edwin Klebs described short and filamentous bacilli in the Peyer's patches in typhoid victims. The bacterium's role in disease was speculated but not confirmed.\nIn 1880, Karl Joseph Eberth described a bacillus that he suspected was the cause of typhoid. Eberth is given credit for discovering the bacterium definitively by successfully isolating the same bacterium from 18 of 40 typhoid victims and failing to discover the bacterium present in any \"control\" victims of other diseases. In 1884, pathologist Georg Theodor August Gaffky (1850\u20131918) confirmed Eberth's findings. Gaffky isolated the same bacterium as Eberth from the spleen of a typhoid victim, and was able to grow the bacterium on solid media. The organism was given names such as Eberth's bacillus, \"Eberthella\" Typhi, and Gaffky-Eberth bacillus. Today, the bacillus that causes typhoid fever goes by the scientific name \"Salmonella enterica\" serovar Typhi.\nChlorination of water.\nMost developed countries had declining rates of typhoid fever throughout the first half of the 20th century due to vaccinations and advances in public sanitation and hygiene. In 1893, attempts were made to chlorinate the water supply in Hamburg, Germany, and in 1897 Maidstone, England, was the first town to have its entire water supply chlorinated. In 1905, following an outbreak of typhoid fever, the City of Lincoln, England, instituted permanent water chlorination. The first permanent disinfection of drinking water in the US was made in 1908 to the Jersey City, New Jersey, water supply. Credit for the decision to build the chlorination system has been given to John L. Leal. The chlorination facility was designed by George W. Fuller.\nOutbreaks in traveling military groups led to the creation of the Lyster bag in 1915: a bag with a faucet that can be hung from a tree or pole, filled with water, and comes with a chlorination tablet to drop into the water. The Lyster bag was essential for the survival of American soldiers in the Vietnam War.\nDirect transmission and carriers.\nThere were several occurrences of milk delivery men spreading typhoid fever throughout the communities they served. Although typhoid is not spread through milk itself, there were several examples of milk distributors in many locations watering their milk down with contaminated water, or cleaning the glass bottles the milk was placed in with contaminated water. Boston had two such cases around the turn of the 20th century. In 1899, there were 24 cases of typhoid traced to a single milkman, whose wife had died of typhoid fever a week before the outbreak. In 1908, J.J. Fallon, who was also a milkman, died of typhoid fever. Following his death and confirmation of the typhoid fever diagnosis, the city conducted an investigation of typhoid symptoms and cases along his route and found evidence of a significant outbreak. A month after the outbreak was first reported, the \"Boston Globe\" published a short statement declaring the outbreak over, stating \"[a]t Jamaica Plain there is a slight increase, the total being 272 cases. Throughout the city, there is a total of 348 cases.\" There was at least one death reported during this outbreak: Mrs. Sophia S. Engstrom, aged 46. Typhoid continued to ravage the Jamaica Plain neighborhood in particular throughout 1908, and several more people were reported dead due to typhoid fever, although these cases were not explicitly linked to the outbreak. The Jamaica Plain neighborhood at that time was home to many working-class and poor immigrants, mostly from Ireland.\nThe most notorious carrier of typhoid fever, but by no means the most destructive, was Mary Mallon, known as Typhoid Mary. Although other cases of human-to-human spread of typhoid were known at the time, the concept of an asymptomatic carrier, who was able to transmit disease, had only been hypothesized and not yet identified or proven. Mary Mallon became the first known example of an asymptomatic carrier of an infectious disease, making typhoid fever the first known disease being transmissible through asymptomatic hosts. The cases and deaths caused by Mallon were mainly upper-class families in New York City. At the time of Mallon's tenure as a personal cook for upper-class families, New York City reported 3,000 to 4,500 cases of typhoid fever annually. In the summer of 1906, two daughters of a wealthy family and maids working in their home became ill with typhoid fever. After investigating their home water sources and ruling out water contamination, the family hired civil engineer George Soper to conduct an investigation of the possible source of typhoid fever in the home. Soper described himself as an \"epidemic fighter\". His investigation ruled out many sources of food, and led him to question if the cook the family hired just prior to their household outbreak, Mallon, was the source. Since she had already left and begun employment elsewhere, he proceeded to track her down in order to obtain a stool sample. When he was able to finally meet Mallon in person he described her by saying \"Mary had a good figure and might have been called athletic had she not been a little too heavy.\" In recounts of Soper's pursuit of Mallon, his only remorse appears to be that he was not given enough credit for his relentless pursuit and publication of her personal identifying information, stating that the media \"rob[s] me of whatever credit belongs to the discovery of the first typhoid fever carrier to be found in America.\" Ultimately, 51 cases and 3 deaths were suspected to be caused by Mallon.\nIn 1924, the city of Portland, Oregon, experienced an outbreak of typhoid fever, consisting of 26 cases and 5 deaths, all deaths due to intestinal hemorrhage. All cases were concluded to be due to a single milk farm worker, who was shedding large amounts of the typhoid pathogen in his urine. Misidentification of the disease, due to inaccurate Widal test results, delayed identification of the carrier and proper treatment. Ultimately, it took four samplings of different secretions from all of the dairy workers in order to successfully identify the carrier. Upon discovery, the dairy worker was forcibly quarantined for seven weeks, and regular samples were taken, most of the time the stool samples yielding no typhoid and often the urine yielding the pathogen. The carrier was reported as being 72 years old and appearing in excellent health with no symptoms. Pharmaceutical treatment decreased the amount of bacteria secreted, however, the infection was never fully cleared from the urine, and the carrier was released \"under orders never again to engage in the handling of foods for human consumption.\" At the time of release, the authors noted \"for more than fifty years he has earned his living chiefly by milking cows and knows little of other forms of labor, it must be expected that the closest surveillance will be necessary to make certain that he does not again engage in this occupation.\"\nOverall, in the early 20th century the medical profession began to identify disease carriers and evidence of transmission independent of water contamination. In a 1933 American Medical Association publication, physicians' treatment of asymptomatic carriers is best summarized by the opening line \"Carriers of typhoid bacilli are a menace\". Within the same publication, the first official estimate of typhoid carriers is given: 2\u20135% of all typhoid patients, and distinguished between temporary carriers and chronic carriers. The authors further estimate that there are four to five chronic female carriers to every one male carrier, although offered no data to explain this assertion of a gender difference in the rate of typhoid carriers. As far as treatment, the authors suggest: \"When recognized, carriers must be instructed as to the disposal of excreta as well as to the importance of personal cleanliness. They should be forbidden to handle food or drink intended for others, and their movements and whereabouts must be reported to the public health officers\".\nToday, typhoid carriers exist all over the world, but the highest incidence of asymptomatic infection is likely to occur in South/Southeast Asian and Sub-Saharan countries. The Los Angeles County department of public health tracks typhoid carriers and reports the number of carriers identified within the county yearly; between 2006 and 2016 0\u20134 new cases of typhoid carriers were identified per year. Cases of typhoid fever must be reported within one working day from identification. As of 2018, chronic typhoid carriers must sign a \"Carrier Agreement\" and are required to test for typhoid shedding twice yearly, ideally every 6 months. Carriers may be released from their agreements upon fulfilling \"release\" requirements, based on completion of a personalized treatment plan designed with medical professionals. Fecal or gallbladder carrier release requirements: 6 consecutive negative feces and urine specimens submitted at 1-month or greater intervals beginning at least 7 days after completion of therapy. Urinary or kidney carrier release requirements: 6 consecutive negative urine specimens submitted at 1-month or greater intervals beginning at least 7 days after completion of therapy.\nDue to the nature of asymptomatic cases, many questions remain about how individuals can tolerate infection for long periods, how to identify such cases, and efficient options for treatment. Researchers are working to understand asymptomatic infection with \"Salmonella\" species by studying infections in laboratory animals, which will ultimately lead to improved prevention and treatment options for typhoid carriers. In 2002, John Gunn described the ability of \"Salmonella\" sp. to form biofilms on gallstones in mice, providing a model for studying carriage in the gallbladder. Denise Monack and Stanley Falkow described a mouse model of asymptomatic intestinal and systemic infection in 2004, and Monack went on to demonstrate that a subpopulation of superspreaders are responsible for the majority of transmission to new hosts, following the 80/20 rule of disease transmission, and that the intestinal microbiota likely plays a role in transmission. Monack's mouse model allows long-term carriage of \"Salmonella\" in mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen and liver.\nVaccine development.\nBritish bacteriologist Almroth Edward Wright first developed an effective typhoid vaccine at the Army Medical School in Netley, Hampshire. It was introduced in 1896 and used successfully by the British during the Second Boer War in South Africa. At that time, typhoid often killed more soldiers at war than were lost due to enemy combat. Wright further developed his vaccine at a newly opened research department at St Mary's Hospital Medical School in London in 1902, where he established a method for measuring protective substances (opsonin) in human blood. Wright's version of the typhoid vaccine was produced by growing the bacterium at body temperature in broth, then heating the bacteria to 60\u00a0\u00b0C to \"heat inactivate\" the pathogen, killing it, while keeping the surface antigens intact. The heat-killed bacteria was then injected into a patient. To show evidence of the vaccine's efficacy, Wright then collected serum samples from patients several weeks post-vaccination, and tested their serum's ability to agglutinate live typhoid bacteria. A \"positive\" result was represented by clumping of bacteria, indicating that the body was producing anti-serum (now called antibodies) against the pathogen.\nCiting the example of the Second Boer War, during which many soldiers died from easily preventable diseases, Wright convinced the British Army that 10 million vaccine doses should be produced for the troops being sent to the Western Front, thereby saving up to half a million lives during World War I. The British Army was the only combatant at the outbreak of the war to have its troops fully immunized against the bacterium. For the first time, their casualties due to combat exceeded those from disease.\nIn 1909, Frederick F. Russell, a U.S. Army physician, adopted Wright's typhoid vaccine for use with the Army, and two years later, his vaccination program became the first in which an entire army was immunized. It eliminated typhoid as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. military. Typhoid vaccination for members of the American military became mandatory in 1911. Before the vaccine, the rate of typhoid fever in the military was 14,000 or greater per 100,000 soldiers. By World War I, the rate of typhoid in American soldiers was 37 per 100,000.\nDuring the Second World War, the United States Army authorized the use of a trivalent vaccine \u2013 containing heat-inactivated Typhoid, Paratyphi A and Paratyphi B pathogens.\nIn 1934, the discovery of the Vi capsular antigen by Arthur Felix and Miss S. R. Margaret Pitt enabled the development of the safer Vi Antigen vaccine \u2013 which is widely in use today. Arthur Felix and Margaret Pitt also isolated the strain Ty2, which became the parent strain of Ty21a, the strain used as a live-attenuated vaccine for typhoid fever today.\nAntibiotics and resistance.\nChloramphenicol was isolated from \"Streptomyces\" by David Gotlieb during the 1940s. In 1948, American army doctors tested its efficacy in treating typhoid patients in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Individuals who received a full course of treatment cleared the infection, whereas patients given a lower dose had a relapse. Asymptomatic carriers continued to shed bacilli despite chloramphenicol treatment \u2013 only ill patients were improved with chloramphenicol. Resistance to chloramphenicol became frequent in Southeast Asia by the 1950s, and today chloramphenicol is only used as a last resort due to the high prevalence of resistance.\nTerminology.\nThe disease has been referred to by various names, often associated with symptoms, such as gastric fever, enteric fever, abdominal typhus, infantile remittent fever, slow fever, nervous fever, phytogenic fever, drain fever, and low fever.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was published weekly for nearly a century. Starting in March 2020, it transitioned to every other week. It was first published in New York City on March 3, 1923, and for many years it was run by its influential co-founder, Henry Luce.\nA European edition (\"Time Europe\", formerly known as \"Time Atlantic\") is published in London and also covers the Middle East, Africa, and, since 2003, Latin America. An Asian edition (\"Time Asia\") is based in Hong Kong. The South Pacific edition, which covers Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific Islands, is based in Sydney.\nSince 2018, \"Time\" has been owned by Salesforce founder Marc Benioff, who acquired it from Meredith Corporation. Benioff currently publishes the magazine through the company Time USA, LLC.\nHistory.\n20th century.\n\"Time\" has been based in New York City since its first issue published on March 3, 1923, by Briton Hadden (1898\u20131929) and Henry Luce (1898\u20131967). It was the first weekly news magazine in the United States. The two had previously worked together as chairman and managing editor, respectively, of the \"Yale Daily News\". They first called the proposed magazine \"Facts\" to emphasize brevity so a busy man could read it in an hour. They changed the name to \"Time\" and used the slogan \"Take Time\u00a0\u2013 It's Brief\". Hadden was considered carefree and liked to tease Luce. He saw \"Time\" as important but also fun, which accounted for its heavy coverage of celebrities and politicians, the entertainment industry, and pop culture, criticizing it as too light for serious news.\n\"Time\" set out to tell the news through people, and until the late 1960s, the magazine's cover depicted a single person. More recently, \"Time\" has incorporated \"People of the Year\" issues, which have grown in popularity over the years. The first issue of \"Time\" featured Joseph G. Cannon, the retired Speaker of the House of Representatives, on its cover; a facsimile reprint of Issue No. 1, including all of the articles and advertisements contained in the original, was included with copies of the magazine's issue from February 28, 1938, in commemoration of its 15th anniversary. The cover price was 15\u00a2 (equivalent to $ in 2024).\nFollowing Hadden's death in 1929, Luce became the dominant man at \"Time\" and a significant figure in the history of 20th-century media. According to \"Time Inc.: The Intimate History of a Publishing Enterprise 1923\u20131941\" by Robert Elson, \"Roy Edward Larsen\u00a0... was to play a role second only to Luce's in the development of Time Inc\". In his book \"The March of Time, 1935\u20131951\", Raymond Fielding also noted that Larsen was \"originally circulation manager and then general manager of \"Time\", later publisher of \"Life\", for many years president of Time Inc., and in the long history of the corporation the most influential and important figure after Luce\".\nAround the time, they were raising $100,000 from wealthy Yale University alumni, including Henry P. Davison, partner of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., publicity man Martin Egan and J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. banker Dwight Morrow; Henry Luce and Briton Hadden hired Larsen in 1922. Larsen was a Harvard University graduate, and Luce and Hadden were Yale graduates. After Hadden died in 1929, Larsen purchased 550 shares of Time Inc., using money he obtained from selling RKO stock he had inherited from his father, who was the head of the Benjamin Franklin Keith theater chain in New England. However, after Briton Hadden's death, the largest Time, Inc. stockholder was Henry Luce, who ruled the media conglomerate in an autocratic fashion; \"at his right hand was Larsen\", Time Inc.'s second-largest stockholder, according to \"Time Inc.: The Intimate History of a Publishing Enterprise 1923\u20131941\". In 1929, Roy Larsen was also named a Time Inc. director and vice president. J. P. Morgan retained a certain control through two directorates and a share of stocks, both over \"Time\" and \"Fortune\". Other shareholders were Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co., and the New York Trust Company (Standard Oil).\nAfter \"Time\" began publishing weekly in March 1923, Roy Larsen increased its circulation by using U.S. radio and movie theaters worldwide. It often promoted both \"Time\" magazine and U.S. political and corporate interests. According to \"The March of Time\", as early as 1924, Larsen had brought \"Time\" into the infant radio business by broadcasting a 15-minute sustaining quiz show entitled \"Pop Question\" which survived until 1925. Then in 1928, Larsen \"undertook the weekly broadcast of a 10-minute programme series of brief news summaries, drawn from current issues of \"Time\" magazine\u00a0... which was originally broadcast over 33 stations throughout the United States\".\nLarsen next arranged for the 30-minute radio program \"The March of Time\" to be broadcast over CBS beginning on March 6, 1931. Each week, the program presented a dramatization of the week's news for its listeners; thus \"Time\" magazine itself was brought \"to the attention of millions previously unaware of its existence\", according to \"Time Inc.: The Intimate History of a Publishing Enterprise 1923\u20131941\", leading to increased circulation during the 1930s. Between 1931 and 1937, Larsen's \"The March of Time\" radio program was broadcast over CBS radio, and between 1937 and 1945, it was broadcast over NBC radio\u00a0\u2013 except between 1939 and 1941, when it was not aired. \"People\" magazine was based on \"Time\"'s \"People\" page.\nTime Inc. stock owned by Luce at the time of his death was worth about $109\u00a0million &amp;lpar;&amp;dollar;\u00a0in &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Tooltip/styles.css\" /&gt;), and it had been yielding him a yearly dividend of more than $2.4\u00a0million &amp;lpar;&amp;dollar;\u00a0in &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Tooltip/styles.css\" /&gt;), according to Curtis Prendergast's \"The World of Time Inc.: The Intimate History of a Changing Enterprise 1960\u20131980\". The Larsen family's Time Inc. stock was worth around $80\u00a0million during the 1960s. Roy Larsen was both a Time Inc. director and the chairman of its executive committee, later serving as Time Inc.'s board's vice chairman until the middle of 1979. On September 10, 1979, \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"Mr. Larsen was the only employee in the company's history given an exemption from its policy of mandatory retirement at age 65.\"\nIn 1987, Jason McManus succeeded Henry Grunwald as editor-in-chief, and oversaw the transition before Norman Pearlstine succeeded him in 1995.\nIn 1989, when Time, Inc. and Warner Communications merged, \"Time\" became part of Time Warner, along with Warner Bros.\n21st century.\nIn 2000, \"Time\" became part of AOL Time Warner, which reverted to the name Time Warner in 2003.\nIn 2007, \"Time\" moved from a Monday subscription/newsstand delivery to a schedule where the magazine goes on sale Fridays and is delivered to subscribers on Saturday. The magazine was published on Fridays when it began in 1923.\nIn early 2007, the year's first issue was delayed roughly a week due to \"editorial changes\", including the layoff of 49 employees.\nIn 2009, Time announced it was introducing \"Mine\", a personalized print magazine mixing content from various Time Warner publications based on the reader's preferences. The new magazine was met with a poor reception, with criticism that its focus needed to be more broad to be truly personal.\nThe magazine has an online archive with the unformatted text for every article published. The articles were indexed and converted from scanned images using optical character recognition technology. The minor errors in the text are remnants of the conversion to the digital format.\nIn January 2013, Time Inc. announced that it would cut nearly 500 jobs \u2013 roughly 6% of its 8,000 staff worldwide.\nAlthough \"Time\" magazine has maintained high sales, its ad pages have declined significantly.\nAlso in January 2013, Time Inc. named Martha Nelson as the first female editor-in-chief of its magazine division. In September 2013, Nancy Gibbs was named as the first female managing editor of \"Time\" magazine.\nIn November 2017, Meredith Corporation announced its acquisition of Time, Inc., backed by Koch Equity Development.\nIn 2017, editor and journalist Catherine Mayer, who also founded the Women's Equality Party in the UK, sued \"Time\" through attorney Ann Olivarius for sex and age discrimination. The suit was resolved in 2018.\nIn March 2018, only six weeks after the closure of the sale, Meredith announced that it would explore the sale of \"Time\" and sister magazines \"Fortune\", \"Money\" and \"Sports Illustrated\", since they did not align with the company's lifestyle brands.\nIn October 2018, Meredith Corporation sold \"Time\" to Marc Benioff and his wife Lynne for $190\u00a0million. Benioff is the chairman and co-CEO of Salesforce.com, \"Time\" is to remain separate from that company, with Benioff not involved in the magazine's daily operations.\nForbes COO Jessica Sibley was appointed CEO of Time in November 2022.\nIn late April 2023, \"Time\" announced the elimination of the website's paywall effective June 1, 2023.\nCirculation.\nAs of 2025[ [update]] circulation has been steadily declining.\nDuring the second half of 2009, the magazine had a 34.9% decline in newsstand sales. During the first half of 2010, there was another decline of 30%.\nIn 2012 it had a circulation of 3.3\u00a0million, making it the 11th-most circulated magazine in the United States, and the second-most circulated weekly behind \"People\". In July 2017, its circulation was 3,028,013. In October 2017, \"Time\" circulation dropped to two million. In early 2023 Time had 1.3\u00a0million print subscribers and 250,000 digital subscribers. Combined print and digital circulation was 1 million for the six months to 31 December 2024, down 7.1% year-on-year.\nStyle.\nWriting.\n\"Time\" initially possessed a distinctively \"acerbic, irreverent style\", largely created by Haddon and sometimes called \"Timestyle\". Timestyle made regular use of inverted sentences, as famously parodied in 1936 by Wolcott Gibbs in \"The New Yorker\": \"Backward ran sentences until reeled the mind\u00a0... Where it all will end, knows God!\" \"Time\" also coined or popularized many neologisms which became widespread, including \"socialite\", \"guesstimate\", \"televangelist\", \"pundit\", and \"tycoon\", and some less successful ones such as \"cinemactress\"&lt;ref name=\"time/6772848\" &gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and \"radiorator\". \"Time\" introduced the names \"World War I\" and \"World War II\" in 1939, as opposed to older forms like \"First World War\" and \"World War No. 2\". The false title construction was popularized by \"Time\" and indeed is sometimes called a \"\"Time\"-style adjective\".\nSections.\nMilestones.\nSince its first issue, \"Time\" has had a \"Milestones\" section about significant events in the lives of famous people, including births, marriages, divorces, and deaths. Until 1967, entries in Milestones were short and formulaic. A typical example from 1956:\nDied. Lieut, (j.g.) David Greig (\"Skippy\") Browning Jr., 24, star of the 1952 Olympics as the U.S.'s dazzling three-meter diving champion, national collegiate one-and three-meter diving champ (1951\u201352); in the crash of a North American FJ-3 Fury jet fighter while on a training flight; near Rantoul, Kans.\nA reader wrote a parody of the older form to announce the change:\nDied. Time's delightful but confusing habit of listing names, ages, claims to fame, and other interesting tidbits about the famous newly deceased in its Milestones notices; then the circumstances of, and places where, the deaths occurred; of apparent good sentence structure; in New York.\nListings.\nUntil the mid-1970s, \"Time\" had a weekly \"Listings\" section with capsule summaries or reviews of current significant films, plays, musicals, television programs, and literary bestsellers similar to \"The New Yorker\"'s \"Current Events\" section.\nCover.\n\"Time\" is also known for the red border on its cover, introduced in 1927. The iconic red border was homaged or satirized by Seattle's \"The Stranger\" newspaper in 2010. The border has only been changed eight times since 1927:\nFormer president Richard Nixon has been among the most frequently featured on the cover of \"Time\", having appeared 55 times from August 25, 1952, to May 2, 1994.\nIn October 2020, the magazine replaced its logo with the word \"Vote\", explaining that \"Few events will shape the world to come more than the result of the upcoming US presidential election\".\n2007 redesign.\nIn 2007, \"Time\" redesigned the magazine to update and modernize the format. Among other changes, the magazine reduced the red cover border to promote featured stories, enlarged column titles, reduced the number of featured stories, increased white space around articles, and accompanied opinion pieces with photographs of the writers. The changes were met with both criticism and praise.\nSpecial editions.\nPerson of the Year.\n\"Time\"'s most famous feature throughout its history has been the annual \"Person of the Year\" (formerly \"Man of the Year\") cover story, in which \"Time\" recognizes the individual or group of individuals who have had the biggest impact on news headlines over the past 12 months. The distinction is supposed to go to the person who, \"for good or ill\", has most affected the course of the year; it is, therefore, not necessarily an honor or a reward. In the past, such figures as Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin have been Man of the Year.\nIn 2006, Person of the Year was \"You\", and was met with split reviews. Some thought the concept was creative; others wanted an actual person of the year. Editors Pepper and Timmer reflected that, if it had been a mistake, \"we're only going to make it once\".\nIn 2017, \"Time\" named the \"Silence Breakers\", people who came forward with personal stories of sexual harassment, as Person of the Year.\n\"Time\" 100.\nIn recent years, \"Time\" has assembled an annual list of the 100 most influential people of the year. Originally, they had made a list of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century. These issues usually have the front cover filled with pictures of people from the list and devote a substantial amount of space within the magazine to the 100 articles about each person on the list. In some cases, over 100 people have been included, as when two people have made the list together, sharing one spot.\nThe magazine also compiled \"All-Time 100 best novels\" and \"All-Time 100 Movies\" lists in 2005, \"The 100 Best TV Shows of All-Time\" in 2007, and \"All-Time 100 Fashion Icons\" in 2012.\nIn February 2016, \"Time\" mistakenly included the male author Evelyn Waugh on its \"100 Most Read Female Writers in College Classes\" list (he was 97th on the list). The error created much media attention and concerns about the level of basic education among the magazine's staff. \"Time\" later issued a retraction. In a BBC interview with Justin Webb, Professor Valentine Cunningham of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, described the mistake as \"a piece of profound ignorance on the part of \"Time\" magazine\".\nX covers.\nDuring its history, on seven occasions, \"Time\" has released a special issue with a cover showing an X scrawled over the face of a man, a year, or a national symbol. The first \"Time\" magazine with an X cover was released on May 7, 1945, showing a red X over Adolf Hitler's face which was published the week following his death. The second X cover was released more than three months later on August 20, 1945, with a black X (to date, the magazine's only such use of a black X) covering the flag of Japan, representing the recent surrender of Japan and which signaled the end of World War II. Fifty-eight years later, on April 21, 2003, \"Time\" released another issue with a red X over Saddam Hussein's face, two weeks after the start of the Invasion of Iraq. A third red X issue was that of June 19, 2006, after Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was killed, and a fourth red X cover issue was published on May 20, 2011, after the death of Osama bin Laden. A fifth red X cover issue, that of Dec. 14, 2020, had a red X scrawled over the pandemic-hit year 2020 and the declaration \"the worst year ever\". As of 2024[ [update]], the most recent and seventh X cover issue of \"Time\", that of Nov. 11, 2024, features a red X over the face of Yahya Sinwar following his killing by the Israel Defense Forces.\nCover logo replaced by \"Vote\" logo.\nThe November 2, 2020, issue of the U.S. edition of the magazine, published the day before the 2020 United States presidential election, was the first time that the cover logo \"TIME\" was not used. The cover of that issue used the word \"VOTE\" as a replacement logo, along with artwork by Shepard Fairey of a voter wearing a pandemic face mask. The issue included information on how to vote safely during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The magazine's editor-in-chief and CEO Edward Felsenthal explained this decision for a one-time cover logo change as a \"rare moment, one that will separate history into before and after for generations\".\nSpin-offs.\n\"Time for Kids\".\n\"Time for Kids\" is a division magazine of \"Time\" that is specially published for children and is mainly distributed in classrooms. \"TFK\" contains some national news, a \"Cartoon of the Week\", and a variety of articles concerning popular culture. An annual issue concerning the environment is distributed near the end of the U.S. school term. The publication rarely exceeds ten pages front and back.\n\"Time\" Canada.\nFrom 1942 until 1979, \"Time\" had a Canadian edition that included an insert of five pages of locally produced content and occasional Canadian covers. Following changes in the tax status of Canadian editions of American magazines, \"Time\" closed Canadian bureaus, except for Ottawa, and published identical content to the US edition but with Canadian advertising.\nIn December 2008, \"Time\" discontinued publishing a Canadian edition.\nTime LightBox.\nTime LightBox is a photography blog created and curated by the magazine's photo department that was launched in 2011. In 2011, \"Life\" picked LightBox for its Photo Blog Awards.\nTimePieces NFTs.\nTimePieces is a Web3 community NFT initiative from \"Time\". It included works from over 40 artists from multiple disciplines.\nStaff.\nRichard Stengel was the managing editor from May 2006 to October 2013, when he joined the U.S. State Department. Nancy Gibbs was the managing editor from September 2013 until September 2017. She was succeeded by Edward Felsenthal, who had been \"Time\"'s digital editor.\nNotable contributors.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nWilliam Saroyan (1908\u20131981) lists the full \"Time\" editorial department in the 1940 play \"Love's Old Sweet Song\".\nCompetitors in the U.S..\nOther major American news magazines include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31605", "revid": "48181213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31605", "title": "Two-party system", "text": "Government system dominated by only two major political parties\nA two-party system is a political party system in which two major political parties consistently dominate the political landscape. At any point in time, one of the two parties typically holds a majority in the legislature and is usually referred to as the \"majority\" or \"governing party\" while the other is the \"minority\" or \"opposition party.\" Around the world, the term is used to refer to one of two kinds of party systems. Both result from Duverger's law, which demonstrates that \"winner-take-all\" or \"first-past-the-post\" elections produce two dominant parties over time.\nThe first type of \"two-party system\" is an arrangement in which all (or nearly all) elected officials belong to one of two major parties. In such systems, minor or third parties rarely win any seats in the legislature. Such systems exist, for example, in the United States, the Bahamas, Jamaica, and Zimbabwe. In such systems, while chances for third-party candidates winning election to major national office are remote, it is possible for factions within the larger parties to exert influence on one or even both of the two major parties.\n\"Two-party system\" also indicates an arrangement, common in parliamentary systems, in which two major parties dominate elections, but in which there are viable minor parties and/or independents regularly elected to the legislature. These successful minor parties are often regional parties. In these systems, the two major parties exert proportionately greater influence than their percentage of voters would suggest, and other parties may frequently win election to local or subnational office. Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia are examples of countries that have this kind of two-party system.\nAfrica.\nGhana.\nThe Republic of Ghana since its transition to democracy in 1992 have a strongly institutionalized two-party system led by New Patriotic Party and National Democratic Congress.\nZimbabwe.\nThe politics of Zimbabwe are effectively a two-party system between the Robert Mugabe founded Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front and the opposition coalition Movement for Democratic Change.\nAsia.\nLebanon.\nThe Parliament of Lebanon is mainly made up of two bipartisan alliances. Although both alliances are made up of several political parties on both ends of the political spectrum the two-way political situation has mainly arisen due to strong ideological differences in the electorate. Once again this can mainly be attributed to the winner takes all thesis.\nSouth Korea.\nSouth Korea has a multi-party system that has sometimes been described as having characteristics of a two-party system. Parties will have reconstructions based upon its leader, but the country continues to maintain two major parties. Currently these parties are the liberal Democratic Party of Korea and the conservative People Power Party.\nAustralia.\nHouse of Representatives.\nSince the 1920s, the Australian House of Representatives (and thus the federal government) has in effect been a two-party system.\nSince the end of World War II, Australia's House of Representatives has been dominated by two factions:\nThe Coalition has been in government about two-thirds of time, broken by four periods of Labor governments: 1972\u20131975, 1983\u20131996, 2007\u20132013, and since 2022.\nThe ALP is Australia's largest and oldest continuing political party, formed in 1891 from the Australian labour movement. The party has branches in every state and territory.\nThe Coalition refers to the alliance between the Liberal Party of Australia (Australia's 2nd largest party) and National Party of Australia (4th largest). It was formed after the 1922 Australian federal election, when the Nationalist Party (ancestor of today's Liberal Party) lost its absolute majority, and was only able to remain in government by allying with the Country Party (now called the National Party). Under the Coalition agreement, if the Coalition forms government then the Prime Minister will be the leader of the Liberals, and the Deputy Prime Minister will be the leader of the Nationals. In theory, disagreements between the Coalition's constituent parties would lead to the Coalition splitting apart. This has happened only a few times in Australia's modern political history, and has always resulted in the Coalition coming back together by the next election. The most recent split occurred in 2025, following Labor's landslide victory at that year's election.\nOne reason for Australia's two-party system is because the House of Representatives (which chooses the Prime Minister of Australia) is elected through the instant-runoff voting electoral system. Although voters can preference third parties and independents above the major parties, and the voting method has a reduced spoiler effect, there is still only one member per electoral division (ie: a winner-take-all system) and so major parties tend to win the vast majority of seats even if they need to rely on preferences to do so. For example, a Labor candidate may win a seat with 30% of the vote for Labor and 21% from Australian Greens voters who ranked Labor second.\nSenate.\nOn the other hand, the Australian Senate is effectively a multi-party system, and a Senate majority matching the House is very rare. It uses single transferable vote with multiple Senators for each state/territory. This results in rough proportional representation and as a result, third parties have much more influence and often hold the balance of power. Since 2004, the Australian Greens have been the third largest party in the country, with 8-13% of the national vote and an equivalent amount of Senators. Prior to this, the Australian Democrats was the third largest party. Other current and past parties include One Nation, the Liberal Democrats and Family First.\nSome Australian states have seen the rise of minor parties at either the state or federal level (eg: Centre Alliance in South Australia, Katter's Australian Party in northern Queensland, and the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party in western New South Wales), while some have seen long periods of dominance by one party. Some parties are absent entirely in parts of the country.\nEurope.\nMalta.\nMalta is somewhat unusual in that while the electoral system is single transferable vote (STV), a form with proportional representation traditionally associated with a multi-party system, minor parties have not had much success. Politics is dominated between the centre-left Labour Party and the centre-right Nationalist Party, with no third parties winning seats in Parliament between 1962 and 2017 and since 2022.\nSpain.\nA report in \"The Christian Science Monitor\" in 2008 suggested that Spain was moving toward a \"greater two-party system\" while acknowledging that Spain has many small parties. A 2015 article published by \"WashingtonPost.com\" written by academic Fernando Casal B\u00e9rtoa noted the decline in support for the two main parties, the People's Party (PP) and the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) in recent years, with these two parties winning only 52 percent of the votes in that year's regional and local elections. He explained this as being due to the Spanish economic crisis, a series of political corruption scandals and broken campaign promises. He argued that the emergence of the new Citizens and Podemos parties would mean the political system would evolve into a two-bloc system, with an alliance of the PP and Citizens on the right facing a leftist coalition of PSOE, Podemos and the United Left. Far-right Vox party became the third largest group in the Spanish parliament in the late 2010s.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn countries such as Britain, two major parties which have strong influence emerge and tend to elect most of the candidates, but a multitude of lesser parties exist with varying degrees of influence, and sometimes these lesser parties are able to elect officials who participate in the legislature. In political systems based on the Westminster system, which is a particular style of parliamentary democracy based on the British model and found in many Commonwealth countries, a majority party will form the government and the minority party will form the opposition, and coalitions of lesser parties are possible; in the rare circumstance in which neither party is the majority, a hung parliament arises. Sometimes these systems are described as \"two-party systems\", but they are usually referred to as \"multi-party\" systems or a \"two-party plus\" system. There is not always a sharp boundary between a two-party system and a multi-party system.\nThe Labour Party and the Conservative Party are the two largest parties in the United Kingdom since 1922.\nPoland.\nIn Poland, the two largest parties since the 2005 election have been Civic Platform and the Law and Justice party. These two parties have dominated the political landscape, with one typically forming the government while the other serves as the main opposition. However, several smaller parties exist and often play a significant role, especially in coalition-building or in the Senate, where electoral rules are different. Poland uses a proportional representation system for the Sejm, which allows for the representation of a wider range of political parties compared to majoritarian systems, and enables coalition governments.\nDespite the presence of multiple parties, the rivalry between Civic Platform and Law and Justice has defined Polish politics in the 21st century, leading many observers to describe the system as a de facto two-party system or a \"two-party plus\" system. The political scene is sometimes characterized by polarization between the two major camps, though shifts in public sentiment and political alliances occasionally give rise to third-party movements or temporary realignments.\nWhile the system has not always produced single-party majorities, Law and Justice managed to secure an outright majority in the 2015 election, an uncommon occurrence under Poland\u2019s proportional system. Civic Platform previously led coalition governments, most notably with the Polish People's Party. The political environment remains dynamic, with new parties emerging periodically, though none have yet succeeded in consistently challenging the dominance of the two leading parties.\nCurrent Poland's situation.\nSince 2023 Civic Coalition holds government in coalition with Third Way and New Left.\nIn 2025 Polish presidential election Law and Justice backed-up candidate Karol Nawrocki won against Civic Platform candidate Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski in run-off.\nLatin America.\nMost Latin American countries also have presidential systems very similar to the US often with winner takes all systems. Due to the common accumulation of power in the presidential office both the official party and the main opposition became important political protagonists causing historically two-party systems. Some of the first manifestations of this particularity was with the liberals and conservatives that often fought for power in all Latin America causing the first two-party systems in most Latin American countries which often lead to civil wars in places like Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Venezuela, the Central American Republic and Peru, with fights focusing specially on opposing/defending the privileges of the Catholic Church and the creole aristocracy. Other examples of primitive two-party systems included the Pelucones versus Pipiolos in Chile, Federalists versus Unitarians in Argentina, Colorados versus Liberals in Paraguay and Colorados versus Nationals in Uruguay.\nAs in other regions, the original rivalry between liberals and conservatives was overtaken by a rivalry between center-left (often social-democratic) parties versus center-right liberal conservative parties, focusing more in economic differences than in cultural and religious differences as it was common during the liberal versus conservative period. Examples of this include National Liberation Party versus Social Christian Unity Party in Costa Rica, the peronista Justicialist Party versus Radical Civic Union in Argentina, Democratic Action versus COPEI in Venezuela, the Colombian Liberal Party versus the Colombian Conservative Party in Colombia, Democratic Revolutionary Party versus Paname\u00f1ista Party in Panama and Liberal Party versus National Party in Honduras. After the democratization of Central America following the end of the Central American crisis in the 1990s former far-left guerrillas and former right-wing authoritarian parties, now in peace, make some similar two-party systems in countries like Nicaragua between the Sandinista National Liberation Front and the Liberals and in El Salvador between the Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front and the Nationalist Republican Alliance.\nThe traditional two-party dynamic started to break after a while, especially in the early 2000s; alternative parties won elections breaking the traditional two-party systems including Rafael Caldera's (National Convergence) victory in Venezuela in 1993, \u00c1lvaro Uribe (Colombia First) victory in 2002, Tabar\u00e9 V\u00e1zquez (Broad Front) victory in Uruguay in 2004, Fernando Lugo (Christian Democratic Party) victory in Paraguay in 2008, Ricardo Martinelli (Democratic Change) victory in 2009 in Panama, Luis Guillermo Sol\u00eds (Citizens' Action Party) victory in 2014 in Costa Rica, Mauricio Macri (Republican Proposal) victory in 2015 in Argentina, Nayib Bukele (Grand Alliance for National Unity) victory in 2019 in El Salvador, Gabriel Boric (Approve Dignity) victory in 2021 in Chile and Xiomara Castro (Liberty and Refoundation) victory in 2021 in Honduras, all of them from non-traditional third parties in their respective countries. In some countries like Argentina, Chile and Venezuela the political system is now split in two large multi-party alliances or blocs, one on the left and one on the right of the spectrum, such as Frente de Todos versus Juntos por el Cambio in Argentina, and the Unitary Platform versus Great Patriotic Pole in Venezuela.\nBrazil.\nDuring the imperial period, since 1840, two great parties with a national base alternated its dominance between legislatures: the Liberal and the Conservative. These parties were dissolved in 1889, after the republic was instituted in Brazil, in which the registration of party directories came under the jurisdiction of the states.\nBrazil also had a two-party system for most of its military dictatorship (1964\u20131985): on October 27, 1965, the Institutional Act 2 decree banned all existing parties and conditioned the creation of new parties to the quorum of 1/3 of the then-elected National Congress; resulting in the creation of two parties: a pro-government party, the National Renewal Alliance (ARENA) and an opposition party, the Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB). Despite officially having a bipartisan system, complex electoral mechanisms, nominally neutral, were created to guarantee the prevalence of the ARENA in the National Congress, making Brazil, in practice, a dominant-party system in that period. The two parties were dissolved in 1979, when the regime allowed other parties to form.\nNorth America.\nCanada.\nCanada has a multiparty system at the federal and provincial levels. Some provinces have effectively become two-party systems in which only two parties regularly get members elected, while smaller parties largely fail to secure electoral representation, and two of the three territories are run under a non-partisan consensus government model rather than through a political party system. The provincial legislative assembly of Alberta currently has only two parties; two-party representation has also historically been common in the legislative assemblies of British Columbia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, although all did elect some third-party members in their most recent provincial elections.\nThe Liberal Party of Canada and the Conservative Party of Canada are the two largest parties in Canada.\nCaribbean.\nThe Commonwealth Caribbean while inheriting their basic political and voting system from Great Britain have become two-party systems.

The politics of Barbados are between the Democratic Labour Party and the Barbados Labour Party.\nUnited States.\nThe United States has two dominant political parties; historically, there have been few instances in which third party candidates won an election. In the First Party System, only Alexander Hamilton's Federalist Party and Thomas Jefferson's Democratic-Republican Party were significant political parties. Toward the end of the First Party System, the Democratic-Republicans were dominant (primarily under the presidency of James Monroe).\nUnder the Second Party System, the Democratic-Republican Party split during the 1824 United States presidential election into Adams' Men and Jackson's Men. In the 1828 presidential election, the modern Democratic Party formed in support of Andrew Jackson. The National Republicans were formed in support of John Quincy Adams. After the National Republicans collapsed, the Whig Party and the Free Soil Party quickly formed and collapsed.\nIn 1854, the Third Party System began when the modern Republican Party formed from a loose coalition of former Whigs, Free Soilers and other anti-slavery activists. The Republicans quickly became the dominant party nationally, and Abraham Lincoln became the first Republican President in the 1860 presidential election. The Democrats held a strong, loyal coalition in the Solid South. This period saw the American Civil War where the South (which was mostly dominated by the Southern Democrats) attempted to secede as the Confederate States of America, in an attempt to preserve racial slavery. The South lost the war and were forced to end slavery, and during the following Reconstruction Era the Republicans remained the most popular party nationally while the Democrats remained dominant in the South.\nDuring the Fourth Party System from about 1896 to 1932, the Republicans remained the dominant presidential party, although Democrats Grover Cleveland and Woodrow Wilson were both elected to two terms (non-consecutively in the case of the former).\nThe 1932 United States elections saw the onset of the Fifth Party System and a long period of Democratic dominance due to the New Deal Coalition. Democrat President Franklin D. Roosevelt won landslides in four consecutive elections. Other than the two terms of Republican Dwight Eisenhower from 1953 to 1961, Democrats retained firm control of the presidency until the mid-1960s. In Congress, Democrats retained majorities in both houses for 60 years until the Republican Revolution, broken only by brief Republican majorities.\nThere was a significant change in U.S. politics in 1960, and this is seen by some as a transition to a sixth party system.\nSince the mid-1960s, despite a couple of landslides (such as Richard Nixon carrying 49 states and 61% of the popular vote over George McGovern in 1972; Ronald Reagan carrying 49 states and 58% of the popular vote over Walter Mondale in 1984), presidential elections have been competitive between the predominant Republican and Democratic parties and no one party has been able to hold the presidency for more than three consecutive terms.\nThroughout every American party system, no third party has won a presidential election or majorities in either house of Congress. Despite that, third parties and third party candidates have gained traction and support. In the election of 1912, Theodore Roosevelt won 27% of the popular vote and 88 electoral votes running as a Progressive. In the 1992 presidential election, Ross Perot won 19% of the popular vote but no electoral votes running as an Independent.\nModern American politics, in particular the electoral college system, has been described as duopolistic since the Republican and Democratic parties have dominated and framed policy debate as well as the public discourse on matters of national concern for about a century and a half. Third parties have encountered various blocks in getting onto ballots at different levels of government as well as other electoral obstacles, such as denial of access to general election debates. Since 1987, the Commission on Presidential Debates, established by the Republican and Democratic parties themselves, supplanted debates run since 1976 by the League of Women Voters. The League withdrew its support in protest in 1988 over objections of alleged stagecraft such as rules for camera placement, filling the audience with supporters, approved moderators, predetermined question selection, room temperature and others. The Commission maintains its own rules for admittance and has only admitted a single third-party candidate to a televised debate, Ross Perot, in 1992.\nSome parts of the US have had their own party systems, distinct from the rest of the country.\nComparison with other systems.\nTwo-party systems can be contrasted with:\nCauses.\nThere are several reasons why, in some systems, two major parties dominate the political landscape. There has been speculation that a two-party system arose in the United States from early political battling between the federalists and anti-federalists in the first few decades after the ratification of the Constitution, according to several views. In addition, there has been more speculation that the winner-takes-all electoral system as well as particular state and federal laws regarding voting procedures helped to cause a two-party system.\nPolitical scientists such as Maurice Duverger and William H. Riker claim that there are strong correlations between voting rules and type of party system. Jeffrey D. Sachs agreed that there was a link between voting arrangements and the effective number of parties. Sachs explained how the first-past-the-post voting arrangement tended to promote a two-party system:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The main reason for America's majoritarian character is the electoral system for Congress. Members of Congress are elected in single-member districts according to the \"first-past-the-post\" (FPTP) principle, meaning that the candidate with the plurality of votes is the winner of the congressional seat. The losing party or parties win no representation at all. The first-past-the-post election tends to produce a small number of major parties, perhaps just two, a principle known in political science as Duverger's Law. Smaller parties are trampled in first-past-the-post elections.\u2014\u200a\nConsider a system in which voters can vote for any candidate from any one of many parties. Suppose further that if a party gets 15% of votes, then that party will win 15% of the seats in the legislature. This is termed \"proportional representation\" or more accurately as \"party-proportional representation\". Political scientists speculate that proportional representation leads logically to multi-party systems, since it allows new parties to build a niche in the legislature:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Because even a minor party may still obtain at least a few seats in the legislature, smaller parties have a greater incentive to organize under such electoral systems than they do in the United States.\nIn contrast, a voting system that allows only a single winner for each possible legislative seat is sometimes termed a single-winner voting system and is usually described under the heading of a \"winner-takes-all\" arrangement in the case of a plurality voting system. Each voter can cast a single vote for any candidate within any given legislative district, but the candidate with the most votes wins the seat, although variants, such as requiring a majority, are sometimes used. What happens is that in a general election, a party that consistently comes in third in every district is unlikely to win any legislative seats even if there is a significant proportion of the electorate favoring its positions. This arrangement strongly favors large and well-organized political parties that are able to appeal to voters in many districts and hence win many seats, and discourages smaller or regional parties. Politically oriented people consider their only realistic way to capture political power is to run under the auspices of the two dominant parties, and legislators from both dominant parties have an incentive not to reform the system as it eliminates potential choices and multiple competing policy options, meaning that they do not necessarily need to adopt positions favorable to voters, but only need to be seen as marginally less unfavorable than the only other option to gain votes.\nIn the U.S., forty-eight states have a standard \"winner-takes-all\" electoral system for amassing presidential votes in the Electoral College system. The \"winner-takes-all\" principle applies in presidential elections, since if a presidential candidate gets the most votes in any particular state, \"all\" of the electoral votes from that state are awarded. In all but two states, Maine and Nebraska, the presidential candidate winning a plurality of votes wins all of the electoral votes, a practice called the unit rule.\nDuverger concluded that \"plurality election single-ballot procedures are likely to produce two-party systems, whereas proportional representation and runoff designs encourage multipartyism.\" He suggested there were two reasons why \"winner-takes-all\" systems leads to a two-party system. First, the weaker parties are pressured to form an alliance, sometimes called a \"fusion\", to try to become big enough to challenge a large dominant party and, in so doing, gain political clout in the legislature. Second, voters learn, over time, not to vote for candidates outside of one of the two large parties since their votes for third party candidates are usually ineffectual. As a result, weaker parties are eliminated by voters over time. Duverger pointed to statistics and tactics to suggest that voters tended to gravitate towards one of the two main parties, a phenomenon which he called \"polarization\", and tend to shun third parties. For example, some analysts suggest that the Electoral College system in the United States, by favoring a system of winner-takes-all in presidential elections, is a structural choice favoring only two major parties.\nGary Cox suggested that America's two-party system was highly related with economic prosperity in the country:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The bounty of the American economy, the fluidity of American society, the remarkable unity of the American people, and, most important, the success of the American experiment have all mitigated against the emergence of large dissenting groups that would seek satisfaction of their special needs through the formation of political parties.\nHowever, as of 2022, United States' Gini coefficient (which measures income inequality) ranks near the worst of OECD countries and in the bottom half of all countries, while the country ranks outside the top five countries in terms of GDP per capita.\nAn effort in 2012 by centrist groups to promote ballot access by third-party candidates called Americans Elect spent $15 million to get ballot access but failed to elect any candidates. The lack of choice in a two-party model in politics has often been compared to the variety of choices in the marketplace.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Politics has lagged our social and business evolution\u00a0... There are 30 brands of Pringles in our local grocery store. How is it that Americans have so much selection for potato chips and only two brands\u00a0\u2013 and not very good ones\u00a0\u2013 for political parties?\nThird parties.\nThird parties, meaning a party other than one of the two dominant parties, are possible in two-party systems, but they are often unlikely to exert much influence by gaining control of legislatures or by winning elections. While there are occasional opinions in the media expressed about the possibility of third parties emerging in the United States, for example, political insiders such as the 1980 presidential candidate John Anderson think the chances of one appearing in the early twenty-first century is remote. A report in \"The Guardian\" suggested that American politics has been \"stuck in a two-way fight between Republicans and Democrats\" since the Civil War, and that third-party runs had little meaningful success.\nThird parties in a two-party system can be:\nWhen third parties are built around an ideology which is at odds with the majority mindset, many members belong to such a party not for the purpose of expecting electoral success but rather for personal or psychological reasons. In the U.S., third parties include older ones such as the Libertarian Party and the Green Party and newer ones such as the Pirate Party. Many believe that third parties do not affect American politics by winning elections, but they can act as \"spoilers\" by taking votes from one of the two major parties. They act like barometers of change in the political mood since they push the major parties to consider their demands. An analysis in \"New York Magazine\" by Ryan Lizza in 2006 suggested that third parties arose from time to time in the nineteenth century around single-issue movements such as abolition, women's suffrage, and the direct election of senators, but were less prominent in the twentieth century. With a fusion nomination, a candidate can appear under two separate labels, allowing voters to show support for a candidate and a party.\nA so-called \"third party\" in the United Kingdom were historically the Liberal Democrats, prior to the Scottish National Party taking its place from the 2015 election until the 2024 election by number of the House of Common seats. In the 2010 election, the Liberal Democrats received 23% of the votes but only 9% of the seats in the House of Commons. While electoral results do not necessarily translate into legislative seats, the Liberal Democrats can exert influence if there is a situation such as a hung parliament. In this instance, neither of the two main parties (at present, the Conservative Party and the Labour Party) have sufficient authority to run the government. Accordingly, the Liberal Democrats can in theory exert tremendous influence in such a situation since they can ally with one of the two main parties to form a coalition. This happened in the coalition government of 2010. The two party system in the United Kingdom allows for other parties to exist, although the main two parties tend to dominate politics (for example, the aforementioned coalition government was the first multi-party government since the government of Winston Churchill in the early- to mid-1940s); in this arrangement, other parties are not excluded and can win seats in Parliament. In contrast, the two party system in the United States has been described as a duopoly or an enforced two-party system, such that politics is almost entirely dominated by either the Republicans or Democrats, and third parties rarely win seats in Congress, state legislatures, or even at the local level.\nAdvantages.\nSome historians have suggested that two-party systems promote centrism and encourage political parties to find common positions which appeal to wide swaths of the electorate. It can lead to political stability, which leads, in turn, to economic growth. Historian Patrick Allitt of the Teaching Company suggested that it is difficult to overestimate the long-term economic benefits of political stability. Sometimes two-party systems have been seen as preferable to multi-party systems because they are simpler to govern, with less fractiousness and greater harmony, since it discourages radical minor parties, while multi-party systems can sometimes lead to hung parliaments. Italy, with a multi-party system, has had years of divisive politics since 2000, although analyst Silvia Aloisi suggested in 2008 that the nation may be moving closer to a two-party arrangement, although this no longer seemed the case by the 2010s, which saw the rise of the Five Star Movement and Lega. The two-party system has generally been identified as simpler since there are fewer voting choices.\nDisadvantages.\nTwo-party systems have been criticized for downplaying alternative views, being less competitive, failing the median voter theorem, encouraging voter apathy since there is a perception of fewer choices, and putting a damper on debate within a nation. In a proportional representation system, lesser parties can moderate policy since they are not usually eliminated from government. One analyst suggested the two-party approach may not promote inter-party compromise but may encourage partisanship. In \"The Tyranny of the Two-party system\", Lisa Jane Disch criticizes two-party systems for failing to provide enough options since only two choices are permitted on the ballot. She wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Herein lies the central tension of the two\u2013party doctrine. It identifies popular sovereignty with choice, and then limits choice to one party or the other. If there is any truth to Schattschneider's analogy between elections and markets, America's faith in the two\u2013party system begs the following question: Why do voters accept as the ultimate in political freedom a binary option they would surely protest as consumers? ... This is the tyranny of the two\u2013party system, the construct that persuades United States citizens to accept two\u2013party contests as a \"condition\" of electoral democracy.\nThere have been arguments that the winner-take-all mechanism discourages independent or third-party candidates from running for office or promulgating their views. Ross Perot's former campaign manager wrote that the problem with having only two parties is that the nation loses \"the ability for things to bubble up from the body politic and give voice to things that aren't being voiced by the major parties.\" One analyst suggested that parliamentary systems, which typically are multi-party in nature, lead to a better \"centralization of policy expertise\" in government. Multi-party governments permit wider and more diverse viewpoints in government, and encourage dominant parties to make deals with weaker parties to form winning coalitions. Analyst Chris Weigant of \"the Huffington Post\" wrote that \"the parliamentary system is inherently much more open to minority parties getting much better representation than third parties do in the American system\". After an election in which the party changes, there can be a \"polar shift in policy-making\" when voters react to changes.\nPolitical analyst A. G. Roderick, writing in his book \"Two Tyrants\", argued that the two American parties (the Republican Party and the Democratic Party) were highly unpopular (as of 2015), are not part of the political framework of state governments, and do not represent the 47% of the electorate who identify themselves as \"independents\". He makes a case that the American president should be elected on a non-partisan basis, and asserts that both political parties are \"cut from the same cloth of corruption and corporate influence.\"\nOthers have accused two party systems of encouraging an environment which stifles individual thought processes and analysis. In a two party system, knowledge about political leaning facilitates assumptions to be made about an individual's opinions on a wide variety of topics (e.g. abortion, taxes, the space program, a viral pandemic, human sexuality, the environment, warfare, opinions on police, etc.) which are not necessarily connected.\nThe more destructive problem is the way this skews the discussion of the issues facing the nation. The media \u2013 meaning news sources from Fox News to \"The New York Times\" and everything in between \u2013 seem largely incapable of dealing with any issue outside of the liberal versus conservative paradigm. Whether it's dealing with ISIS, the debt ceiling, or climate change, the media frames every issue as a simple debate between the Democratic and the Republican positions. This creates the ludicrous idea that every public policy problem has two, and only two, approaches. That's nonsense. Certainly some problems have only two resolutions, some have only one, but most have a range of possible solutions. But the \"national\" debate presents every issue as a simplistic duality, which trivializes everything.\n \u2014Michael Coblenz, 2016\nHistory.\nBritish parties.\nThe two-party system, in the sense of the looser definition, where two parties dominate politics but in which third parties can elect members and gain some representation in the legislature, can be traced to the development of political parties in the United Kingdom. There was a division in English politics at the time of the Civil War and Glorious Revolution in the late 17th century. The Whigs supported Protestant constitutional monarchy against absolute rule and the Tories, originating in the Royalist (or \"Cavalier\") faction of the English Civil War, were conservative royalist supporters of a strong monarchy as a counterbalance to the republican tendencies of Parliament. In the following century, the Whig party's support base widened to include emerging industrial interests and wealthy merchants.\nThe basic matters of principle that defined the struggle between the two factions, were concerning the nature of constitutional monarchy, the desirability of a Catholic king, the extension of religious toleration to nonconformist Protestants, and other issues that had been put on the liberal agenda through the political concepts propounded by John Locke, Algernon Sidney and others.\nVigorous struggle between the two factions characterised the period from the Glorious Revolution to the 1715 Hanoverian succession, over the legacy of the overthrow of the Stuart dynasty and the nature of the new constitutional state. This proto two-party system fell into relative abeyance after the accession to the throne of George I and the consequent period of Whig supremacy under Robert Walpole, during which the Tories were systematically purged from high positions in government. Although the Tories were dismissed from office for 50 years, they retained a measure of party cohesion under William Wyndham and acted as a united, though unavailing, opposition to Whig corruption and scandals. At times they cooperated with the \"Opposition Whigs\", Whigs who were in opposition to the Whig government. The ideological gap between the Tories and the Opposition Whigs prevented them from coalescing as a single party.\nBritish emergence.\nThe old Whig leadership dissolved in the 1760s into a decade of factional chaos with distinct \"Grenvillite\", \"Bedfordite\", \"Rockinghamite\", and \"Chathamite\" factions successively in power, and all referring to themselves as \"Whigs\". Out of this chaos, the first distinctive parties emerged. The first such party was the Rockingham Whigs under the leadership of Charles Watson-Wentworth and the intellectual guidance of the political philosopher Edmund Burke. Burke laid out a philosophy that described the basic framework of the political party as \"a body of men united for promoting by their joint endeavours the national interest, upon some particular principle in which they are all agreed\". As opposed to the instability of the earlier factions, which were often tied to a particular leader and could disintegrate if removed from power, the two party system was centred on a set of core principles held by both sides and that allowed the party out of power to remain as the Loyal Opposition to the governing party.\nA genuine two-party system began to emerge, with the accession to power of William Pitt the Younger in 1783 leading the new Tories, against a reconstituted \"Whig\" party led by the radical politician Charles James Fox.\nThe two-party system matured in the early 19th century era of political reform, when the franchise was widened and politics entered into the basic divide between conservatism and liberalism that has fundamentally endured up to the present. The modern Conservative Party was created out of the \"Pittite\" Tories by Robert Peel, who issued the Tamworth Manifesto in 1834 which set out the basic principles of Conservatism \u2013 the necessity in specific cases of reform in order to survive, but an opposition to unnecessary change, that could lead to \"a perpetual vortex of agitation\". Meanwhile, the Whigs, along with free trade Tory followers of Robert Peel, and independent Radicals, formed the Liberal Party under Lord Palmerston in 1859, and transformed into a party of the growing urban middle-class, under the long leadership of William Ewart Gladstone. The two party system had come of age at the time of Gladstone and his Conservative rival Benjamin Disraeli after the Reform Act 1867.\nAmerican.\nAlthough the Founding Fathers of the United States did not originally intend for American politics to be partisan, early political controversies in the 1790s saw the emergence of a two-party political system, the Federalist Party and the Democratic-Republican Party, centred on the differing views on federal government powers of Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton and James Madison. A consensus on these issues ended party politics in 1816 for a decade, a period commonly known as the Era of Good Feelings.\nPartisan politics revived in 1829 with the split of the Democratic-Republican Party into the Jacksonian Democrats led by Andrew Jackson, and the Whig Party, led by Henry Clay. The former evolved into the modern Democratic Party and the latter was replaced with the Republican Party as one of the two main parties in the 1850s.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The war film postulates a fictional conflict between NATO and the Warsaw Pact over Germany that rapidly escalates into a full-scale nuclear exchange between the United States and the Soviet Union. The action itself focuses on the residents of Lawrence, Kansas, and Kansas City, Missouri, and several family farms near American missile silos. The cast includes JoBeth Williams, Steve Guttenberg, John Cullum, Jason Robards, and John Lithgow. The film was written by Edward Hume and produced by Robert Papazian.\nMore than 100\u00a0million people, in nearly 39\u00a0million households, watched the film when it first aired on November 20, 1983, on the ABC television network. With a 46 rating and a 62% share of the viewing audience during the initial broadcast, the film was the seventh-highest-rated non-sports show until then, and in a 2009 Nielsen TV Ratings list was one of the highest-rated television films in US history.\nThe film was broadcast on Soviet state television in 1987, during the negotiations on Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. The producers demanded that the Russian translation conform to the original script and that the broadcast not be interrupted by commentary.\nPlot.\nDr. Russell Oakes works at a hospital in Kansas City, Missouri, and spends time with family as his daughter Marilyn prepares to move away. In nearby Harrisonville, farmer Jim Dahlberg and family hold a wedding rehearsal for his eldest daughter Denise. Airman Billy McCoy, serving with the 351st Strategic Missile Wing, is stationed at a Minuteman launch site in nearby Sweetsage, one of 150 such silos in western Missouri. Next to the site, the Hendrys tend to their farm chores and mind their children. Background television and radio reports reveal information about a Soviet buildup on the East German border. East Germany blockades West Berlin, and the United States issues an ultimatum and places its forces on alert, recalling McCoy from his family at Whiteman Air Force Base.\nThe following day, NATO attempts to break through the blockade at Helmstedt-Marienborn. Warsaw Pact MiGs hit W\u00fcrzburg, West Germany. Moscow is evacuated. At the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas, near Kansas City, the word goes out that the Soviets have invaded West Germany. Soviet forces drive toward the Rhine in an armored thrust. Pre-med student Stephen Klein decides to hitchhike home to Joplin, Missouri, while Denise's fianc\u00e9 Bruce witnesses a crowd of shoppers frantically pulling items off the shelves as both sides attack naval targets in the Persian Gulf. Jim prepares his cellar. People start to flee Kansas City, and the Emergency Broadcast System is activated. NATO attempts to halt the advance by airbursting three nuclear warheads over Soviet troops, while a Soviet nuclear device destroys the NATO headquarters in Brussels. US Air Force personnel aboard the SAC Airborne Command Post receive notification of an incoming wave of 300 ICBMs, then activate their missile launch protocols, sending a wave of ICBMs towards Russia. While the film makes clear that NATO was the first to use nuclear weapons, it is left deliberately unclear who launched the first major attack.\nMcCoy flees his now-empty silo, telling his fellow airmen the war is effectively over. A high-altitude nuclear explosion's EMP disables vehicles and destroys the power grid. Nuclear missiles rain across the region on both military and civilian targets. Kansas City's last minutes are frantic. Bruce, Marilyn Oakes, the Hendrys, and McCoy's family are among the thousands of people incinerated, while the young Danny Dahlberg is flash-blinded by a nuclear detonation many miles away. Dr. Oakes, stranded on the highway, walks to University Hospital at Lawrence, takes charge, and begins treating patients. Klein finds the Dahlberg home and begs for refuge in the family's basement.\nOakes receives fallout reports by shortwave from KU professor Joe Huxley in the science building: travel outdoors is fatal. Patients continue to come and supplies dwindle. Delirious after days in the basement shelter, Denise runs outside; Klein retrieves her, but both are exposed to the thick radioactive dust. McCoy heads towards Sedalia until he learns of its destruction from passing refugees. He befriends a mute man and travels to the hospital, where he dies of radiation poisoning. Oakes bonds with Nurse Nancy Bauer, who later dies of meningitis, and a pregnant woman pleads with him to tell her she's wrong to be hopeless.\nIn a radio speech, the U.S. President announces a ceasefire, promises relief, and stresses no surrender and a reliance on American principles, set to shots of filthy, listless, or dead Americans among the ruins. Attempts at aid from the National Guard and infrastructural redevelopment prove fruitless, and summary executions become commonplace. Jim Dahlberg (and, it is implied, his remaining family) is eventually killed by squatters, while Denise, Klein, and Oakes are wasting away from radiation sickness. Returning to an irradiated Kansas City to see his old home one last time, Oakes witnesses National Guardsmen blindfolding and executing looters. He finds squatters in the ruins of his home and attempts to drive them off, but is instead offered food. Oakes collapses and weeps, and one of the squatters comforts him. The film ends with an overlying audio clip of Huxley's voice on the radio as the screen fades to black, asking if anybody can still hear him, only to be met with silence until the credits, as a Morse code signal transmits a single message to the viewer: M-A-D.\nMost versions of \"The Day After\" include a textual ending disclaimer just before the end credits, stating that the film is fictional and that the real-life outcome of a nuclear war would be much worse than the events portrayed onscreen.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProduction.\n\"The Day After\" was the idea of ABC Motion Picture Division President Brandon Stoddard, who, after watching \"The China Syndrome\", was so impressed that he envisioned creating a film exploring the effects of nuclear war on the United States. Stoddard asked his executive vice president of television movies and miniseries, Stu Samuels, to develop a script. Samuels created the title \"The Day After\" to emphasize that the story was about, not a nuclear war itself, but the aftermath. Samuels suggested several writers, and eventually, Stoddard commissioned the veteran television writer Edward Hume to write the script in 1981. ABC, which financed the production, was concerned about the graphic nature of the film and how to portray the subject appropriately on a family-oriented television channel. Hume undertook a massive amount of research on nuclear war and went through several drafts until ABC finally deemed the plot and characters acceptable.\nOriginally, the film was based more around and in Kansas City, Missouri. Kansas City was not bombed in the original script although Whiteman Air Force Base was, which made Kansas City suffer shock waves and the horde of survivors staggering into town. There was no Lawrence, Kansas in the story although there was a small Kansas town called \"Hampton.\" While Hume was writing the script, he and the producer Robert Papazian, who had great experience in on-location shooting, took several trips to Kansas City to scout locations and met with officials from the Kansas film commission and from the Kansas tourist offices to search for a suitable location for \"Hampton.\" It came down to a choice of either Warrensburg, Missouri, and Lawrence, Kansas, both college towns. Warrensburg was home of Central Missouri State University and was near Whiteman Air Force Base, and Lawrence was home of the University of Kansas and was near Kansas City. Hume and Papazian ended up selecting Lawrence because of the access to a number of good locations: a university, a hospital, football and basketball venues, farms, and a flat countryside. Lawrence was also agreed upon as being the \"geographic center\" of the United States. The Lawrence people were urging ABC to change the name \"Hampton\" to \"Lawrence\" in the script.\nBack in Los Angeles, the idea of making a TV movie showing the true effects of nuclear war on average American citizens was still stirring up controversy. ABC, Hume, and Papazian realized that for the scene depicting the nuclear blast, they would have to use state-of-the-art special effects and so took the first step by hiring some of the best special effects people in the business to draw up some storyboards for the complicated blast scene. ABC then hired Robert Butler to direct the project. For several months, the group worked on drawing up storyboards and revising the script again and again. Then, in early 1982, Butler was forced to leave \"The Day After\" because of other contractual commitments. ABC then offered the project to two other directors, who both turned it down. Finally, in May, ABC hired the feature film director Nicholas Meyer, who had just completed the blockbuster \"\". Meyer was apprehensive at first and doubted ABC would get away with making a television film on nuclear war without the censors diminishing its effect. However, after reading the script, Meyer agreed to direct \"The Day After\".\nMeyer wanted to make sure that he would film the script he was offered. He did not want the censors to censor the film or the film to be a regular Hollywood disaster movie from the start. Meyer figured the more \"The Day After\" resembled such a film, the less effective it would be, and he preferred to present the facts of nuclear war to viewers. He made it clear to ABC that no big TV or film stars should be in \"The Day After\". ABC agreed but wanted to have one star to help attract European audiences to the film when it would be shown theatrically there. Later, while flying to visit his parents in New York City, Meyer happened to be on the same plane with Jason Robards and asked him to join the cast.\nMeyer plunged into several months of nuclear research, which made him quite pessimistic about the future, to the point of becoming ill each evening when he came home from work. Meyer and Papazian also made trips to the ABC censors and to the United States Department of Defense during their research phase and experienced conflicts with both. Meyer had many heated arguments over elements in the script that the network censors wanted cut out of the film. The Department of Defense said that it would cooperate with ABC if the script clarified that the Soviets launched their missiles first, which Meyer and Papazian took pains not to do.\nMeyer, Papazian, Hume, and several casting directors spent most of July 1982 taking numerous trips to Kansas City. In between casting in Los Angeles, where they relied mostly on unknowns, they would fly to the Kansas City area to interview local actors and scout scenery. They were hoping to find some real Midwesterners for smaller roles. Hollywood casting directors strolled through shopping malls in Kansas City to look for local people to fill small and supporting roles, the daily newspaper in Lawrence ran an advertisement calling for local residents to sign up as extras, and a professor of theater and film at the University of Kansas was hired to head up local casting. Out of the eighty or so speaking parts, only fifteen were cast in Los Angeles. The remaining roles were filled in Kansas City and Lawrence.\nWhile in Kansas City, Meyer and Papazian toured the Federal Emergency Management Agency offices in Kansas City. When asked about its plans for surviving nuclear war, a FEMA official replied that it was experimenting with putting evacuation instructions in telephone books in New England. \"In about six years, everyone should have them.\" That meeting led Meyer to later refer to FEMA as \"a complete joke.\" It was during that time that the decision was made to change \"Hampton\" in the script to \"Lawrence.\" Meyer and Hume figured since Lawrence was a real town, it would be more believable, and besides, it was a perfect choice to play a representative of Middle America. The town boasted a \"socio-cultural mix,\" sat near the exact geographic center of the Continental U.S., and was a prime missile target according to Hume and Meyer's research because 150 Minuteman missile silos stood nearby. Lawrence had some great locations, and its people were more supportive of the project. Suddenly, less emphasis was put on Kansas City, the decision was made to have the city annihilated in the script, and Lawrence was made the primary location in the film.\nEditing.\nABC originally planned to air \"The Day After\" as a four-hour \"television event\" that would be spread over two nights with a total running time of 180 minutes without commercials. The director Nicholas Meyer felt the original script was padded, and suggested cutting out an hour of material to present the whole film in one night. The network stuck with its two-night broadcast plan, and Meyer filmed the entire three-hour script, as evidenced by a 172-minute workprint that has surfaced. Subsequently, the network found that it was difficult to find advertisers because of the subject matter . ABC relented and allowed Meyer to edit the film for a one-night broadcast version. Meyer's original single-night cut ran two hours and twenty minutes, which he presented to the network. After that screening, many executives were deeply moved, and some even cried, which led Meyer to believe they approved of his cut.\nNevertheless, a further six-month struggle ensued over the final shape of the film. Network censors had opinions about the inclusion of specific scenes, and ABC itself was eventually intent on \"trimming the film to the bone\" and made demands to cut out many scenes that Meyer strongly lobbied to keep. Finally, Meyer and his editor, Bill Dornisch, balked. Dornisch was fired, and Meyer walked away from the project. ABC brought in other editors, but the network ultimately was not happy with the results they produced. It finally brought Meyer back and reached a compromise, with Meyer paring down \"The Day After\" to a final running time of 120 minutes.\n\"The Day Before\" campaign.\nJosh Baran and Mark Graham were anti-nuclear activists who were secretly given a bootleg copy of the film by Nick Meyer prior to the ABC broadcast. They sent copies of the film to various peace groups, interviewed peace leaders about the film, and held screenings in homes, bars, and restaurants. There were post-screening discussion groups and town hall meetings. They held private screenings for the media, like \"Time\" magazine, the \"New York Times\", and the BBC. As word got out about the film, higher ups wanted to see it including members of the House of Commons, and even the Pope. Baran and Graham called it \"The Day Before\" project to hijack ABC's marketing of the film. One scholar said they \"pioneered the piggybacking of a public issue onto the release of a commercial media product\", and \"Variety\" called it \"the greatest PR campaign in history.\"\nThe consequences of Meyer's bootleg copy and subsequent \"The Day Before\" PR campaign was a groundswell of public interest and discussion before the film was ever broadcast. This made it difficult for ABC executives to kill the film, because there were rumors they wanted to quietly shelve it, including rumors that Ronald Reagan had hinted to studio executives he didn't want the film broadcast.\nBroadcast.\n\"The Day After\" was initially scheduled to premiere on ABC in May 1983, but the post-production work to reduce the film's length pushed back its initial airdate to November. Censors forced ABC to cut an entire scene of a child having a nightmare about nuclear holocaust and then sitting up screaming. A psychiatrist told ABC that it would disturb children. \"This strikes me as ludicrous,\" Meyer wrote in \"TV Guide\" at the time, \"not only in relation to the rest of the film, but also when contrasted with the huge doses of violence to be found on any average evening of TV viewing.\" More cuts were made, including to a scene in which Denise possesses a diaphragm. Another scene in which a hospital patient abruptly sits up screaming was excised from the original television broadcast but restored for home video releases. Meyer persuaded ABC to dedicate the film to the citizens of Lawrence and also to put a disclaimer at the end of the film after the credits to let the viewer know that \"The Day After\" downplayed the true effects of nuclear war so it could have a story. The disclaimer also included a list of books that provided more information on the subject.\n\"The Day After\" received a large promotional campaign prior to its broadcast. Commercials aired several months in advance, and ABC distributed half-a-million \"viewer's guides\" that discussed the dangers of nuclear war and prepared the viewer for the graphic scenes of mushroom clouds and radiation burn victims. Discussion groups were also formed nationwide.\nMusic.\nThe composer David Raksin wrote original music and adapted music from \"The River\", a documentary film score by the concert composer Virgil Thomson, by featuring an adaptation of the hymn \"How Firm a Foundation\". Although he recorded just under 30 minutes of music, much of it was edited out of the final cut. Music from the \"First Strike\" footage, conversely, was not edited out.\nDeleted and alternative scenes.\nThe film was shortened from the original three hours of running time to two, which caused the scrapping of several planned special-effects scenes although storyboards were made in anticipation of a possible \"expanded\" version. They included a \"bird's eye\" view of Kansas City at the moment of two nuclear detonations as seen from a Boeing 737 airliner approaching the city's airport, simulated newsreel footage of U.S. troops in West Germany taking up positions in preparation of advancing Soviet armored units, and the tactical nuclear exchange in Germany between NATO and the Warsaw Pact after the attacking Warsaw Pact force breaks through and overwhelms the NATO lines.\nABC censors severely toned down scenes to reduce the body count or severe burn victims. Meyer refused to remove key scenes, but reportedly, some eight and a half minutes of excised footage still exist, significantly more graphic. Some footage was reinstated for the film's release on home video. Additionally, the nuclear attack scene was longer and supposed to feature very graphic and very accurate shots of what happens to a human body during a nuclear blast. Examples included people being set on fire; their flesh carbonizing; being burned to the bone; eyes melting; faceless heads; skin hanging; deaths from flying glass and debris, limbs torn off, being crushed, and blown from buildings by the shockwave; and people in fallout shelters suffocating during the firestorm. Also cut were images of radiation sickness, as well as graphic post-attack violence from survivors such as food riots, looting, and general lawlessness as authorities attempted to restore order.\nOne cut scene showed surviving students battling over food. The two sides were to be athletes and the science students under the guidance of Professor Huxley. Another brief scene that was later cut related to a firing squad in which two U.S. soldiers are blindfolded and executed. In that scene, an officer reads the charges, verdict, and sentence as a bandaged chaplain reads the Last Rites. A similar sequence occurs in a 1965 British-produced faux documentary, \"The War Game\". In the initial 1983 broadcast of \"The Day After\", when the U.S. president addresses the nation, the voice was an imitation of President Reagan, who later stated that he watched the film and was deeply moved. In subsequent broadcasts, that voice was overdubbed by a stock actor.\nHome video releases in the U.S. and internationally come in at various running times, many listed at 126 or 127 minutes. Full screen (4:3 aspect ratio) seems to be more common than widescreen. RCA videodiscs of the early 1980s were limited to 2 hours per disc so that full screen release appears to be closest to what originally aired on ABC in the U.S. A 2001 U.S. VHS version (Anchor Bay Entertainment, Troy, Michigan) lists a running time of 122 minutes. A 1995 double laser disc \"director's cut\" version (Image Entertainment) runs 127 minutes, includes commentary by director Nicholas Meyer and is \"presented in its 1.75:1 European theatrical aspect ratio\" (according to the LD jacket).\nTwo different German DVD releases run at 122 and 115 minutes respectively; the edits reportedly downplay the Soviet Union's role. A two disc Blu-ray special edition was released in 2018 by the video specialty label Kino Lorber and present the film in high definition. The release contains the 122-minute television cut, presented in a 4:3 aspect ratio as broadcast, as well as the 127-minute theatrical cut, presented in a .\nReception.\nOn its original broadcast, on Sunday, November 20, 1983, John Cullum warned viewers before the film was premiered that the film would contain graphic and disturbing scenes and encouraged parents who had young children watching to watch together and discuss the issues of nuclear warfare. ABC and local TV affiliates opened 1-800 hotlines with counselors standing by. There were no commercial breaks after the nuclear attack scenes. ABC then aired a live debate on \"Viewpoint\", ABC's occasional discussion program hosted by \"Nightline\"'s Ted Koppel, featuring the scientist Carl Sagan, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Elie Wiesel, former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, General Brent Scowcroft, and the commentator William F. Buckley Jr. Sagan argued against nuclear proliferation, but Buckley promoted the concept of nuclear deterrence. Sagan described the arms race in the following terms: \"Imagine a room awash in gasoline, and there are two implacable enemies in that room. One of them has nine thousand matches, the other seven thousand matches. Each of them is concerned about who's ahead, who's stronger.\"\nThe film and its subject matter were prominently featured in the news media both before and after the broadcast, appearing on the covers of \"Time\", \"Newsweek\", \"U.S. News &amp; World Report,\" and \"TV Guide.\" Critics tended to claim the film was sensationalizing nuclear war or that it was too tame. The special effects and realistic portrayal of nuclear war received praise. The film received 12 Emmy nominations and won two Emmy awards. It was rated \"way above average\" in \"Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide\" until all reviews for films exclusive to television were removed from the publication.\nIn the United States, 38.5\u00a0million households, or an estimated 100\u00a0million people, watched \"The Day After\" on its first broadcast, a record audience for a made-for-TV movie. Producers Sales Organization released the film theatrically around the world, in the Eastern Bloc, China, North Korea and Cuba (this international version contained six minutes of footage not in the telecast edition). Since commercials are not sold in those markets, Producers Sales Organization failed to gain revenue to the tune of an undisclosed sum. Years later, the international version was released to tape by Embassy Home Entertainment.\nThe actor and former Nixon adviser Ben Stein, critical of the movie's message that the strategy of mutual assured destruction would lead to a war, wrote in the Los Angeles \"Herald-Examiner\" what life might be like in an America under Soviet occupation. Stein's idea was eventually dramatized in the miniseries \"Amerika\", also broadcast by ABC. The \"New York Post\" accused Meyer of being a traitor, writing, \"Why is Nicholas Meyer doing Yuri Andropov's work for him?\" Phyllis Schlafly declared that \"This film was made by people who want to disarm the country, and who are willing to make a $7 million contribution to that cause\". Richard Grenier in \"National Review\" accused \"The Day After\" of promoting \"unpatriotic\" and pro-Soviet attitudes. Much press comment focused on the unanswered question in the film of who started the war. The television critic Matt Zoller Seitz, in his 2016 book co-written with Alan Sepinwall, \"TV (The Book)\", named \"The Day After\" as the fourth-greatest American TV movie of all time: \"Very possibly the bleakest TV-movie ever broadcast, \"The Day After\" is an explicitly antiwar statement dedicated entirely to showing audiences what would happen if nuclear weapons were used on civilian populations in the United States.\"\nThe movie had a profound effect on Generation X. Many children in grade school and middle school at the time of its release were traumatized by viewing it and credit the film with instilling a sense of dread, nihilism, and despondency in many of their cohort. It is postulated that this singular event could be a major impetus for what became the Gen X hallmark of being a \"slacker generation\" that espoused \"whatever\" as a life concept, since it was hopeless to plan ahead under the constant threat of nuclear annihilation.\nEffects on policymakers.\nUS President Ronald Reagan watched the film more than a month before its screening on Columbus Day, October 10, 1983. He wrote in his diary that the film was \"very effective and left me greatly depressed\" and that it changed his mind on the prevailing policy on a \"nuclear war\". The film was also screened for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. A government advisor who attended the screening, a friend of Meyer, told him: \"If you wanted to draw blood, you did it. Those guys sat there like they were turned to stone.\" In 1987, Reagan and Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which resulted in the banning and reducing of their nuclear arsenal. In Reagan's memoirs, he drew a direct line from the film to the signing. Reagan supposedly later sent Meyer a telegram after the summit: \"Don't think your movie didn't have any part of this, because it did.\" During an interview in 2010, Meyer said that the telegram was a myth and that the sentiment stemmed from a friend's letter to Meyer. He suggested the story had origins in editing notes received from the White House during the production, which \"may have been a joke, but it wouldn't surprise me, him being an old Hollywood guy.\"\nThe film also had impact outside the United States. In 1987, during the era of Gorbachev's \"glasnost\" and \"perestroika\" reforms, the film was shown on Soviet television. Four years earlier, Georgia Representative Elliott Levitas and 91 co-sponsors introduced a resolution in the U.S. House of Representatives \"[expressing] the sense of the Congress that the American Broadcasting Company, the Department of State, and the U.S. Information Agency should work to have the television movie \"The Day After\" aired to the Soviet public\".\nAccolades.\n\"The Day After\" won two Emmy Awards and received 10 other Emmy nominations.\nEmmy Awards won:\nEmmy Award nominations:\nIt was released two weeks before \"The Day After\" aired.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A player wins when they mark all three spaces of a row, column, or diagonal of the grid, whereupon they traditionally draw a line through those three marks to indicate the win. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.\nNames.\nIn American English, the game is known as \"tic-tac-toe\". It may also be spelled \"tick-tack-toe\", \"tick-tat-toe\", or \"tit-tat-toe\".\nIn Commonwealth English (particularly British, South African, Indian, Australian, and New Zealand English), the game is known as \"noughts and crosses\", alternatively spelled \"naughts and crosses\". This name derives from the shape of the marks in the game (i.e the X and O); \"nought\" is another name for the number zero, while \"cross\" refers to the X shape.\nSometimes, tic-tac-toe (where players keep adding \"pieces\") and three men's morris (where pieces start to move after a certain number have been placed) are confused with each other.\nGameplay.\nTic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid.\nIn the following example, the first player (\"X\") wins the game in seven steps:\nThere is no universally agreed rule as to who plays first, but in this article the convention that X plays first is used.\nPlayers soon discover that the best play from both parties leads to a draw. Hence, tic-tac-toe is often played by young children who may not have discovered the optimal strategy.\nBecause of the simplicity of tic-tac-toe, it is often used as a pedagogical tool for teaching the concepts of good sportsmanship and the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the searching of game trees. It is straightforward to write a computer program to play tic-tac-toe perfectly or to enumerate the 765 essentially different positions (the state space complexity) or the 26,830 possible games up to rotations and reflections (the game tree complexity) on this space. If played optimally by both players, the game always ends in a draw, making tic-tac-toe a futile game.\nThe game can be generalized to an \"m\",\"n\",\"k\"-game, in which two players alternate placing stones of their own color on an \"m\"-by-\"n\" board with the goal of getting \"k\" of their own color in a row. Tic-tac-toe is the 3,3,3-game. Harary's generalized tic-tac-toe is an even broader generalization of tic-tac-toe. It can also be generalized as an \"n\"\"d\" game, specifically one in which \"n\" = 3 and \"d\" = 2. It can be generalised even further by playing on an arbitrary incidence structure, where rows are lines and cells are points. Tic-tac-toe's incidence structure consists of nine points, three horizontal lines, three vertical lines, and two diagonal lines, with each line consisting of at least three points.\nHistory.\nGames played on three-in-a-row boards can be traced back to ancient Egypt, where such game boards have been found on roofing tiles dating from around 1300 BC.\nAn early variation of tic-tac-toe was played in the Roman Empire, around the first century BC. It was called \"terni lapilli\" (\"three pebbles at a time\") and instead of having any number of pieces, each player had only three; thus, they had to move them around to empty spaces to keep playing. The game's grid markings have been found chalked all over Rome. Another closely related ancient game is three men's morris which is also played on a simple grid and requires three pieces in a row to finish, and Picaria, a game of the Puebloans.\nThe different names of the game are more recent. The first print reference to \"noughts and crosses\" (nought being an alternative word for 'zero'), the British name, appeared in 1858, in an issue of \"Notes and Queries\". The first print reference to a game called \"tick-tack-toe\" occurred in 1884, but referred to \"a children's game played on a slate, consisting of trying with the eyes shut to bring the pencil down on one of the numbers of a set, the number hit being scored\". \"Tic-tac-toe\" may also derive from \"tick-tack\", the name of an old version of backgammon first described in 1558. The US renaming of \"noughts and crosses\" to \"tic-tac-toe\" occurred in the 20th century.\nIn 1952, \"OXO\" (or \"Noughts and Crosses\"), developed by British computer scientist Sandy Douglas for the EDSAC computer at the University of Cambridge, became one of the first known video games. The computer player could play perfect games of tic-tac-toe against a human opponent.\nIn 1975, tic-tac-toe was also used by MIT students to demonstrate the computational power of Tinkertoy elements. The Tinkertoy computer, made out of (almost) only Tinkertoys, is able to play tic-tac-toe perfectly. It is currently on display at the Computer History Museum.\nCombinatorics.\nWhen considering only the state of the board, and after taking into account board symmetries (i.e. rotations and reflections), there are only 138 terminal board positions. A combinatorics study of the game shows that when \"X\" makes the first move every time, the game outcomes are as follows:\nStrategy.\nA player can play a perfect game of tic-tac-toe (to win or at least draw) if, each time it is their turn to play, they choose the first available move from the following list, as used in Newell and Simon's 1972 tic-tac-toe program.\nThe first player, who shall be designated \"X\", has three possible strategically distinct positions to mark during the first turn. Superficially, it might seem that there are nine possible positions, corresponding to the nine squares in the grid. However, by rotating the board, we will find that, in the first turn, every corner mark is strategically equivalent to every other corner mark. The same is true of every edge (side middle) mark. From a strategic point of view, there are therefore only three possible first marks: corner, edge, or center. Player X can win or force a draw from any of these starting marks; however, playing the corner gives the opponent the smallest choice of squares which must be played to avoid losing. This might suggest that the corner is the best opening move for X, however another study shows that if the players are not perfect, an opening move in the center is best for X.\nThe second player, who shall be designated \"O\", must respond to X's opening mark in such a way as to avoid the forced win. Player O must always respond to a corner opening with a center mark, and to a center opening with a corner mark. An edge opening must be answered either with a center mark, a corner mark next to the X, or an edge mark opposite the X. Any other responses will allow X to force the win. Once the opening is completed, O's task is to follow the above list of priorities in order to force the draw, or else to gain a win if X makes a weak play.\nMore detailed, to guarantee a draw, O should adopt the following strategies:\nWhen X plays corner first, and O is not a perfect player, the following may happen:\nFurther details.\nConsider a board with the nine positions numbered as follows:\nWhen X plays 1 as their opening move, then O should take 5. Then X takes 9 (in this situation, O should not take 3 or 7, O should take 2, 4, 6 or 8):\nor 6 (in this situation, O should not take 4 or 7, O should take 2, 3, 8 or 9. In fact, taking 9 is the best move, since a non-perfect player X may take 4, then O can take 7 to win).\nIn both of these situations (X takes 9 or 6 as the second move), X has a property to win.\nIf X is not a perfect player, X may take 2 or 3 as a second move. Then this game will be a draw, X cannot win.\nIf X plays 1 opening move, and O is not a perfect player, the following may happen:\nAlthough O takes the only good position (5) as the first move, O takes a bad position as the second move:\nAlthough O takes good positions in the first two moves, O takes a bad position in the third move:\nO takes a bad position as first move (except of 5, all other positions are bad):\nVariations.\nMany board games share the element of trying to be the first to get \"n\"-in-a-row, including three men's morris, nine men's morris, pente, gomoku, Qubic, Connect Four, Quarto, Gobblet, Order and Chaos, Toss Across, and Mojo. Tic-tac-toe is an instance of an m,n,k-game, where two players alternate taking turns on an \"m\"\u00d7\"n\" board until one of them gets \"k\" in a row. Harary's generalized tic-tac-toe is an even broader generalization. The game can be generalised even further by playing on an arbitrary hypergraph, where rows are hyperedges and cells are vertices.\nOther variations of tic-tac-toe include:\nOne can play on a board of 4x4 squares, winning in several ways. Winning can include: 4 in a straight line, 4 in a diagonal line, 4 in a diamond, or 4 to make a square.\nAnother variant, Qubic, is played on a 4\u00d74\u00d74 board; it was solved by Oren Patashnik in 1980 (the first player can force a win). Higher dimensional variations are also possible.\nIn popular culture.\nVarious game shows have been based on tic-tac-toe and its variants:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31611", "revid": "51020073", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31611", "title": "Tallinn Airport", "text": "Airport in Tallinn, Estonia\nTallinn Airport () is the largest international airport in Estonia. The airport is also officially called Lennart Meri Tallinn Airport (\"\") after the former president of Estonia Lennart Meri.\nThe airport is located southeast of the city centre of Estonian capital Tallinn, on the eastern shore of Lake \u00dclemiste. It was previously known until 2009 as Tallinn \u00dclemiste Airport. The airport has a single asphalt/concrete runway, 08/26, that is and large enough to handle wide-bodied aircraft such as the Boeing 747, six taxiways and seventeen terminal gates.\nHistory.\nEarly development.\nPrior to the establishment of the present airport in \u00dclemiste area, Lasnam\u00e4e Airfield was the primary airport of Tallinn, serving as a base for Aeronaut airline. After Aeronaut went bankrupt in 1928, air service was continued by Deruluft, which used Nehatu instead, from the centre of Tallinn. The first seaplane harbour on the shores of Lake \u00dclemiste was built 1928 to 1929 in order to serve Finnish seaplanes. The use of this harbour ended in World War II. On 26 March 1929 Riigikogu passed an expropriation act in order to establish a public airport. of land was expropriated from Dvigatel joint-stock company and another was expropriated from descendants of Vagner. 10 million sents were paid to land-owners as indemnity. Land leveling and renovation works took another 5 million sents.\nThe building of Tallinn Airport started on 16 November 1931, and the first test landing was commenced by captain Reissar piloting Estonian Air Force Avro 594 Avian, tail number 120. The airport was opened officially on 20 September 1936, although it had been operational a good while before the official opening - LOT Polish Airlines, which commenced its first passenger flight from Tallinn on 18 August 1932 with Fokker F.VIIb/3m from Lasnam\u00e4e Airfield, later relocated the flights to Tallinn Airport and in 1935 the airport had 6 arrivals and departures on average every day. In April 1935 a ramp for seaplanes was built on a shore of Lake \u00dclemiste, together with a small arch bridge and a customs office, which allowed seaplanes to be relocated from a sea port. The same year the airport administration building was erected, which also served initially as a waiting place for travellers. The total cost of the whole airport project, including the cost of building flight hangars, was 25 million sents.\nAs the very first runways had soft surface, it made them unavailable for takeoffs and landings during spring and autumn seasons. Therefore, only seaplanes stationed at Lake \u00dclemiste were able to carry out flights, and during winter months, it was possible to use the frozen surface of the lake as a runway for small airplanes. The concrete paved runways of the first stage, inaugurated together with the opening of the airport, were about wide and long. As they were arranged in a form of a triangle, they allowed takeoffs and landings in six directions. These were the first concrete-paved runway in Estonia, it was needed some of stone, of construction aggregate and of cement to construct them.\nIn addition, of pipeworks was laid for drainage purposes. Before World War II, Tallinn Airport had regular connections to abroad by at least Aerotransport (now part of the SAS Group), Deutsche Luft Hansa, LOT and the Finnish company Aero (now Finnair). On 5 April 1937 the Helsinki-Tallinn-Warsaw-Jerusalem route was inaugurated by Mr. Bobkowski, the assistant of the Polish Minister of Transport. The length of the route was and the journey time was 34 hours. Passengers and cargo numbers grew quickly, from 4,100 passengers and of cargo in 1933 to 11,892 passengers and of cargo in 1937. Preparation and design works for a new passenger terminal started in 1938. 14 various projects were submitted for the architectural contest of the new terminal building, with the one from the architect Artur J\u00fcrvetson winning the contest in February the same year. The construction costs were estimated at 300 thousand Estonian kroons. The first airplane of then the flag carrier of Estonia, AGO, arrived at Tallinn Airport on 5 October 1939, flying the route Dessau - K\u00f6nigsberg - Tallinn.\nAs Estonia was occupied by Soviet Union, on 22 July 1940 the order was made by Soviet occupation authorities to transfer the airport to Soviet Air Forces. All aircraft, which were at the airport at that time, including interned Polish Lockheed 14, two Junkers Ju 52 of AGO and PTO-4 trainer aircraft of Estonian Airclub, were relocated to Lasnam\u00e4e Airfield.\nDuring the German occupation, regular international connections were announced on 16 October and already restored on 15 November 1941, when Deutsche Lufthansa and Aero O/Y started the route Helsinki-Tallinn-Riga-K\u00f6nigsberg-Berlin. From 1942 to 1944 \"Sonderstaffel Buschmann\" was based at Tallinn Airport.\nSoviet period.\nBetween 1945 and 1989, Aeroflot was the only airline that served Tallinn Airport.\nThe construction of the new passenger terminal, which was put on hold due to war, resumed. The building, which was redesigned in accordance with the Stalinist architecture, was finished in 1954 and commissioned on 7 November 1955. Regular flights with jet aircraft began on 2 October 1962 with a maiden passenger flight from Moscow with a Tu-124, which was the latest Soviet airliner. As the terminal built in 1954 became obsolete and unable to cope with growing airport traffic, the construction of the current terminal building began in 1976 and the terminal was opened in 1980, prior to the 1980 Summer Olympics sailing event, which was held in the city. The architect of the new terminal was Mihhail Piskov, who took visual inspiration from traditional Estonian housebarns, and the interior designer was Maile Gr\u00fcnberg. The runway was also lengthened then. The first foreign airline since World War II to operate regular flights from Tallinn was SAS, whose first flight to the airport took place on 25 November 1989.\nModern development.\nThe construction works of the first cargo terminal (Cargo 1), located in the middle of future cargo area on the north side of the airport, were carried out from September 1997 until March 1998. The passenger terminal building was completely modernised in 1999, increasing its capacity to 1.4 million passengers per year, and after that greatly expanded in 2008. The growing demand for extra space for cargo operations, created a situation where there was a need for cargo terminal expansion, Cargo 2. In order to meet the growing demand for new cargo facilities at Tallinn Airport, the number of cargo terminals was later expanded to four. In the year 2012, a new aircraft maintenance hangar was opened and the number of passengers passed two million mark the first time in the history of the airport. On 11 January 2013, the airport was accepted into Airport Carbon Accreditation emission managing and reduction programme by ACI. The year 2013 saw the introduction of an automatic border control system and athestart of construction of a new business aviation hangar complex. \n2008 expansion.\nThe airport underwent a large expansion project between January 2006 and September 2008. The existing terminal was expanded by and the architects of the project were Jean Marie Bonnard, Pia Tasa and Inge Sirkel-Suviste. The terminal was expanded in three directions, resulting in 18 new gates, separate lounges for Schengen and non-Schengen passengers, 10 new check-in desks and a new restaurant and cafes. Due to the gallery that connects all the gates and was constructed in the middle of the terminal building the terminal became T-shaped. The projecting terminal section enables a two-level traffic for international passengers. The renewed terminal has nine passenger bridges. The extensions constructed at the ends of the terminal building became additional rooms for registering for the flights and for delivering arriving luggage. Outside the terminal, the apron was refurbished and expanded and a new taxiway was added. The new terminal allows the airport to handle twice as many passengers as it could handle before. The renovated terminal received the award \"Concrete Building of the Year 2008\" by the Estonian Concrete Association.\nRenaming.\nAfter the death of former president of Estonia Lennart Meri on 14 March 2006, journalist Argo Ideon from Eesti Ekspress proposed to honour the president's memory by naming Tallinn Airport after him\u00a0\u2013 \"\" (Lennart Meri International Airport), drawing parallels with John F. Kennedy International Airport, Charles de Gaulle Airport, Sabiha G\u00f6k\u00e7en International Airport etc. Ideon's article also mentioned the fact that Meri himself had shown concern for the condition of the then Soviet-era construction (in one memorable case Meri, having arrived from Japan, led the group of journalists that were expecting him, to the airport's toilets to do the interview there, in order to point out the shoddy condition of the facilities).\nThe name change was discussed at a board meeting on 29 March 2006, and on the opening of the new terminal on 19 September 2008, Prime Minister Andrus Ansip officially announced the renaming would take place in March 2009\nBaltic Sea cruise turnarounds.\nIn 2011 a new project of cruise turnarounds was launched in cooperation with Tallinn Passenger Port and Happy Cruises. More than 7,000 Spanish passengers travelled that year on charter flights to and from Tallinn Airport. As the airport is located only from the city center cruise quay, transfer time from airport to cruise ship is under an hour.\nIn 2012, Pullmantur Air started its charter operations from Madrid\u2013Barajas Airport with three Airbus A321s and two to three Boeing 747s. During the summer 2012 about 16,000 tourists were transferred. The company continued operations in 2013, transferring 25,000 tourists in five turnarounds, as well as there was one partial turnaround operation for the cruise ship MS Deutschland operated by Peter Deilmann Cruises.\nIn 2015, cruise tourists were attended to by four airlines \u2013 Iberia, Iberia Express, Wamos Air, and Vueling. Some 5,000 passengers were expected during three turnarounds for Pullmantur Cruises cruise line. Tallinn Airport served 9,369 cruise turnaround passengers in 2015. No cruise turnarounds are expected in summer 2016 due to construction works, but the airport plans to continue them in 2017.\nDemise of Estonian Air.\nOn 7 November 2015, Estonian Air was liquidated following an adverse decision by the European Commission. This meant a significant temporary loss of business for the airport, as Estonian Air had been the largest carrier, accounting for one third of all capacity in 2014.\nFuture expansion.\nAccording to Erik Sakkov, board member of Tallinn Airport, the future plans include expanding the runway by to serve regular long-haul flights, also building of a brand-new taxiway, new storage facilities, a new point-to-point terminal, and expansion of the existing passenger terminal, so it can serve arriving and departing passengers on two different levels. On 21 February 2013, the environmental impact assessment of the airport development project started. The project includes the runway lengthening by , installation of the ILS Category II equipment, also lengthening of the existing northern taxiway till the end of the expanded runway, constructing of a whole new taxiway and a new apron area on the southern side of the airport, installation of the new perimeter security systems and constructing of an engine test facility and dedicated snow storage and de-icing areas. Among other benefits the extension would enable planes to fly higher above the city of Tallinn by moving threshold of the runway further from Lake \u00dclemiste, thus reducing noise level.\nThe public discussion of the runway extension environmental effects evaluation report took place on 16 December 2013 and the construction work to extend the runway has begun on 1 May 2016. The length of the renovated runway is 3480 meters, the construction contract was concluded with Lemmink\u00e4inen Eesti. On 17 November 2016 the airport administration reported, that the runway expansion works are completed, thus the runway became the longest one in the Baltic states. The runway and the main taxiway were extended to the east and a new system of navigation lights was installed. In the summer and autumn of 2016 the construction work caused restrictions on nighttime flight operations but had no impact on scheduled operations. The soil of the safety area around the extended runway was enforced to reduce potential risks to aircraft in the event of runway overrun or excursion. In the course of the expansion work in 2016 some 45,000 tons of asphalt and 4,000 m3 of concrete were laid down, also 60 kilometers of new duct access was built and 100 kilometers of new cables and 400 new navigation lights installed, as well as 10 kilometers of new rainwater removal infrastructure built. The expansion of the airstrip increased the airport's safety area by 41 hectares and five kilometers of new service roads were built. The whole expansion works must be completed by the end of 2017.\nOn 12 June 2013 the City Administration of Tallinn approved a detailed planning for a 0.91 ha land plot, on which a new maintenance hangar is going to be built. Total five-year investment plan amounts of more than 100 million euros. The airport is investing \u20ac126 million during the 2015\u20132021 period. The most important project is the reconstruction of the runway infrastructure at cost of \u20ac75 million. Additional investment of \u20ac2.5 million would be made in flight terminal in order to change its layout and improve the terminal's security, capacity and VIP area. \u0410 multi-storey car park for 1,200 vehicles and 150 taxis would be built due to the consistently increasing need for parking spots around the airport. Work on the task and procurement conditions of the parking structure began in 2014. It will be located in front of the passenger terminal and should be completed in 2017 according to current plans. On 10 April 2019, Tallinn Airport announced plans to expand the airport terminal and build an airport city by 2035. The expanded terminal is planned to serve 6 to 8 million passengers per year with an expanded area of 85 000 m2 and 26 gates instead of 13.\nTallinn Airport aims for carbon neutrality by 2030. Solar farms at five locations are expected to generate 40% of its electricity needs this year. Plans are also in place to switch to green electricity from the grid by 2027 and to produce green hydrogen from surplus solar energy.\nPlanned Terminal 2.\nAs the airport's current facilities could not serve more than 2.5 million passengers per year and the number of passengers is rapidly growing (38.2% in year 2011), a new terminal dedicated to low-cost airlines is planned to be built. On 12 April 2012 Tallinn Airport announced, that it will build next year a new terminal with five stands for low-cost airlines, which will be easily removable and extendable. The new terminal would be intended for low-cost airlines such as Ryanair, Easyjet and Norwegian that do not want to pay that much to the airport and do not need many airport services. The new terminal is intended for the service of one million passengers and the space previously occupied by low-cost airlines would pass into the disposition of Nordica and other traditional airlines.\nFacilities.\nThere is one passenger terminal and four cargo terminals at the airport. These are located to the right of Runway 08's threshold, with Runway 26 being connected to the terminal segment by a parallel taxiway as long as the runway.\nTerminal building.\nEstonian EXPO Center year-round permanent exhibition is located near the Gate 3, acting as a live advertising space where promotion representatives introduce the companies taking part in the exhibition and help finding cooperation partners in particular fields of business. The center was opened on 22 July 2010. VKG has opened an oil shale themed exposition at Gate 4 on 9 January 2013, showing the history and development of Estonian oil shale industry. The Estonian Tourist Board has opened a brand new \"Visit Estonia\" themed exposition at Gate 5 on 2 October 2013. The gate is divided into three parts: a children's territory with a Lotte-themed playhouse, an interactive, informative waiting area decorated with Estonian national patterns and a bridge from the gate to the airplane that introduces travellers to Estonian nature.\nPassenger facilities.\nA lending library was opened on 9 May 2013 in a special area by Gate 1. All books were donated by public including Estonian president Toomas Hendrik Ilves and the First Lady of Estonia Evelin Ilves. The library has books in ten different languages, the majority being in Estonian, Russian and English. There will also be a selection of children's books. On 16 August 2013 Tallinn Airport unveiled a gallery and started exhibiting artists' work in the Passenger Terminal. The gallery of rotating exhibitions on the 1st floor of the Passenger Terminal is open to all arriving and departing passengers as well as those seeing them off or meeting them.\nOn 1 September 2013, the airport opened an automatic border control system, that was meant to accelerate procedures for passengers travelling out of the Schengen area. The fully automated border crossing system consists of two automated gates and six registering kiosks.\nThe Nordea Lounge services business class passengers of Air Baltic, Finnair, LOT Polish Airlines, Lufthansa and SAS, as well as Priority Pass and members of the Metropolis loyalty programme.\nAdditional Tallinn Airport GH check-in terminal is located at the Radisson Blu Hotel Tallinn. Travellers can check in online and print boarding cards directly from the lobby. The system allows to check in 24 hours before departure and choose own specific seat.\nAirport museum and activity centre.\nThe museum is located in a small building near the terminal, also a relatively large area nearby will be transformed into open-air exhibition. Two ancient cult stones, which it is necessary to move during the expansion of the runway, will be transferred to that exhibition. The whole museum plot will be separated from the airfield. The museum will have a direct access from E263 motorway (shares the same route with Estonian main road 2). Additionally, a platform with a view onto the runway will be constructed, giving good possibilities for aircraft spotting. The activity centre opened in 2016.\nBusiness aviation hangar complex.\nOn 20 March 2013 the airport authorities announced a public procurement for constructing a new hangar complex.\nThe cornerstone of the new complex was laid on 27 September 2013. It has a surface area of , is located right next to the existing General Aviation Terminal and will be servicing aircraft within a distance of up to 3,000 kilometers from Tallinn. The complex is intended for accommodating a total of nine planes, eight of them are mid-size business jets and one aircraft the size of a large corporate aircraft. It consists of five hangars: the Hangar 1 for the large aircraft (such as Boeing 737, Airbus A318 or Airbus A319), hangars 2 to 5 are intended for smaller business jets (Bombardier Challenger 605, Learjet 60). The whole complex was opened on 15 April 2014 and its operator is Panaviatic, which is going to expand its business jet operations from Tallinn Airport. Apart from providing hangarage for business jets, the new complex also offers MRO services by Panaviatic's subsidiary AS Panaviatic Maintenance. The total investment was close to 5 million euros and the whole complex is the largest in the Baltic states.\nAviation services.\nMagnetic MRO has its facilities and headquarters on the airport property. On 6 September 2012 the company opened a new column-free three-bay hangar for Base Maintenance works of narrow-body aircraft, such as Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. The company has in total three main Base Maintenance lines, and two additional lines for lighter checks and modification works. With the addition of the new hangar, the maximum annual line maintenance capacity of the company boosted to 72 aircraft from the present 24. Magnetic MRO said the new hangar will allow it carry out a planned doubling of its workforce. On 21 December 2015 Magnetic MRO announced a launch of the second painting hangar, which will be built in co-operation with Tallinn Airport, in response to growing demand for painting services. The new hangar with further expansion possibilities will be capable of housing aircraft in size up to Boeing 737 MAX 9 and Airbus A321neo, as well as regional aircraft, and according to the agreement, the hangar is planned to be finalized and ready for use by 1 June 2017.\nAir freight.\nTallinn Airport has 4 cargo terminals with total warehouse space of ca 11,600\u00a0m2. The size of warehouse in Cargo 1 is 3601\u00a0m2 and 2066\u00a0m2 are dedicated for the office area. Cargo terminal is operated by different operators (including integrators) and Tallinn Airport Ltd. only acts as a lessor. The size of Cargo 2 warehouse is 1255\u00a0m2 and 758\u00a0m2 are dedicated for office space. Cargo 2 is operated by TNT Express Worldwide. Other logistics operators include DHL, UPS and FedEx.\nAirlines and destinations.\nPassenger.\nThe following airlines operate scheduled year-round or seasonal routes at Tallinn Airport:\nStatistics.\nTotal passengers using the airport has increased on average by 14.2% annually since 1998. On 16 November 2012 Tallinn Airport has reached two million passenger landmark for the first time in its history. Passenger data reflects international and domestic flights combined, share of domestic flights compared to international flights was marginal. Passenger and cargo numbers exclude direct transit.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGround transportation.\nTram.\nThe best connection between downtown Tallinn and the airport is provided by tramline \"4\". The tram network extension to the airport terminal was opened on 1 September 2017. Trams mostly go with 6-minute intervals, the journey from downtown to the airport (and vice versa) takes 18\u201319 minutes. Trams run through the 150-metre long \u00dclemiste tram tunnel beneath the Tallinn-Narva railway. Like all public transportation in Tallinn, the tram is free to the city's residents.\nIn 2023, the tram service was suspended due to construction of Rail Baltica terminal. The service will be unavailable until June 2026.\nBus.\nThe line \"2\" offers a connection to Tallinn downtown and Tallinn Baltic Station, and, on the other way, M\u00f5igu subdistrict (located 1\u20132\u00a0km southeast from the airport) . The line \"2\" buses go mostly with 15-20 minute intervals.\nThe line \"15\" temporarily (until the reopening of tram service) provides connections to downtown and S\u00f5jam\u00e4e industrial area.\nThe line \"49\" provides connections to Viimsi Parish, as well as to Iru subdistrict, the village of Iru and Pirita and Lasnam\u00e4e districts.\nThe line \"65\" provides a connection to Lasnam\u00e4e district.\nIntercity buses of Tallinn - Tartu line operated by Lux Express make a stop at the airport on both directions.\nRail.\nThe nearest station is \u00dclemiste train station, which lies about 800 metres from the airport, near \u00dclemiste Keskus. It provides access to regional rail and commuter rail lines of Elron. The station and Tallinn Airport are connected through the bus lines \"49\" and \"65\" and the tram line \"4\".\n\u00dclemiste will be directly connected to the Rail Baltica when it eventually opens.\nHighway.\nThe airport is accessed by the E263 expressway (which shares the same route with the Estonian national road T2). The E20 expressway (which follows the T1) intersects with the E263 expressway away from the airport towards the city centre. The E67 expressway (Via Baltica, follows the Estonian national road T4) is easily accessible via the dual carriageway J\u00e4rvevana Road, which provides a direct connection with E263 at the intersection.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

{"id": "31620", "revid": "28481209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31620", "title": "Giant cell arteritis", "text": "Inflammatory disease of large blood vessels\nMedical condition&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nGiant cell arteritis (GCA), also called temporal arteritis, is an inflammatory autoimmune disease of large blood vessels. Symptoms may include headache, pain over the temples, flu-like symptoms, double vision, and difficulty opening the mouth. Complications can include blockage of the artery to the eye with resulting blindness, as well as aortic dissection, and aortic aneurysm. GCA is frequently associated with polymyalgia rheumatica. \nThe cause is unknown. The underlying mechanism involves inflammation of the small blood vessels that supply the walls of larger arteries. This mainly affects arteries around the head and neck, though some in the chest may also be affected. Diagnosis is suspected based on symptoms, blood tests, and medical imaging, and confirmed by biopsy of the temporal artery. However, in about 10% of people the temporal artery is normal.\nTreatment is typical with high doses of steroids such as prednisone or prednisolone. Once symptoms have resolved, the dose is decreased by about 15% per month. Once a low dose is reached, the taper is slowed further over the subsequent year. Other medications that may be recommended include bisphosphonates to prevent bone loss and a proton-pump inhibitor to prevent stomach problems.\nIt affects about 1 in 15,000 people over the age of 50 per year. The condition mostly occurs in those over the age of 50, being most common among those in their 70s. Females are more often affected than males. Those of northern European descent are more commonly affected. Life expectancy is typically normal. The first description of the condition occurred in 1890.\nSigns and symptoms.\nCommon symptoms of giant cell arteritis include:\nThe inflammation may affect blood supply to the eye; blurred vision or sudden blindness may occur. In 76% of cases involving the eye, the ophthalmic artery is involved, causing arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.\nGiant cell arteritis may present with atypical or overlapping features. Early and accurate diagnosis is important to prevent ischemic vision loss. Therefore, this condition is considered a medical emergency.\nWhile studies vary as to the exact relapse rate of giant cell arteritis, relapse of this condition can occur. It most often happens at low doses of prednisone (&lt;20\u00a0mg/day), during the first year of treatment, and the most common signs of relapse are headache and polymyalgia rheumatica.\nAssociated conditions.\nThe varicella-zoster virus (VZV) antigen was found in 74% of temporal artery biopsies that were GCA-positive, suggesting that the VZV infection may trigger the inflammatory cascade.\nThe disorder may co-exist (in about half of cases) with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), which is characterized by sudden onset of pain and stiffness in muscles (pelvis, shoulder) of the body and is seen in the elderly. GCA and PMR are so closely linked that they are often considered to be different manifestations of the same disease process. PMR usually lacks the cranial symptoms, including headache, pain in the jaw while chewing, and vision symptoms, that are present in GCA.\nGiant cell arteritis can affect the aorta and lead to aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection. Up to 67% of people with GCA having evidence of an inflamed aorta, which can increase the risk of aortic aneurysm and dissection. There are arguments for the routine screening of each person with GCA for this possible life-threatening complication by imaging the aorta. Screening should be done on a case-by-case basis based on the signs and symptoms of people with GCA.\nMechanism.\nThe pathological mechanism is the result of an inflammatory cascade that is triggered by an as of yet undetermined cause resulting in dendritic cells in the vessel wall recruiting T cells and macrophages to form granulomatous infiltrates. These infiltrates erode the middle and inner layers of the arterial tunica media leading to conditions such as aneurysm and dissection. Activation of T helper 17 (Th17) cells involved with interleukin (IL) 6, IL-17, IL-21 and IL-23 play a critical part; specifically, Th17 activation leads to further activation of Th17 through IL-6 in a continuous, cyclic fashion. This pathway is suppressed with glucocorticoids, and more recently it has been found that IL-6 inhibitors also play a suppressive role.\nDiagnosis.\nBiopsy.\nThe gold standard for diagnosing temporal arteritis is biopsy, which involves removing a small part of the vessel under local anesthesia and examining it microscopically for giant cells infiltrating the tissue. However, a negative result does not definitively rule out the diagnosis; since the blood vessels are involved in a patchy pattern, there may be unaffected areas on the vessel and the biopsy might have been taken from these parts. Unilateral biopsy of a 1.5\u20133\u00a0cm length is 85\u201390% sensitive (1\u00a0cm is the minimum). Characterised as intimal hyperplasia and medial granulomatous inflammation with elastic lamina fragmentation with a CD4+ predominant T cell infiltrate, currently biopsy is only considered confirmatory for the clinical diagnosis, or one of the diagnostic criteria.\nMedical imaging.\nRadiological examination of the temporal artery with ultrasound yields a halo sign. Contrast-enhanced brain MRI and CT are generally negative in this disorder. Recent studies have shown that 3T MRI using super high resolution imaging and contrast injection can non-invasively diagnose this disorder with high specificity and sensitivity. Temporal artery thickening on imaging has been demonstrated to have highest positive likelihood ratios for GCA when compared with other non invasive diagnostic tests.\nEarly recognition.\nWomen and men approximately 45 years old and who suffer from several complaints (at least 5 of the 16 symptoms) listed below could have giant cell arteritis.\nTreatment.\nGCA is considered a medical emergency due to the potential of irreversible vision loss. Corticosteroids, typically high-dose prednisone (1\u00a0mg/kg/day), should be started as soon as the diagnosis is suspected (even before the diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy) to prevent irreversible blindness secondary to ophthalmic artery occlusion. Steroids do not prevent the diagnosis from later being confirmed by biopsy, although certain changes in the histology may be observed towards the end of the first week of treatment and are more difficult to identify after a couple of months. The dose of corticosteroids is generally slowly tapered over 12\u201318 months. Oral steroids are at least as effective as intravenous steroids, except in the treatment of acute visual loss where intravenous steroids appear to offer significant benefit over oral steroids. Short-term side effects of prednisone are uncommon but can include mood changes, avascular necrosis, and an increased risk of infection. Some of the side effects associated with long-term use include weight gain, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, avascular necrosis, glaucoma, cataracts, cardiovascular disease, and an increased risk of infection. It is unclear whether adding a small amount of aspirin is beneficial or not as it has not been studied. Injections of tocilizumab may also be used. Tocilizumab is a humanized antibody that targets the interleukin-6 receptor, which is a key cytokine involved in the progression of GCA. Tocilizumab has been found to be effective at minimizing both recurrence, and flares of GCA when used both on its own and with corticosteroids. Long term use of tocilizumab requires further investigation. Tocilizumab may increase the risk of gastrointestinal perforation and infections, however it does not appear that there are more risks than using corticosteroids.\nEpidemiology.\nGiant cell arteritis typically only occurs in those over the age of 50; particularly those in their 70s. It affects about 1 in 15,000 people over the age of 50 per year. It is more common in women than in men, by a ratio of 2:1, and more common in those of Northern European descent, as well as in those residing further from the Equator. Roughly 1 in 5 people with polymyalgia rheumatica also have giant cell arteritis.\nDisease impact.\nGiant cell arteritis and its treatment impact on people's lives because of symptoms, adverse effects of GCs and disruption to normal life. People with GCA have previously ranked \"losing sight in both eyes permanently\", \"having intense or severe pain\" and \"feeling weak, tired or exhausted\" as important quality of life domains.\nTerminology.\nThe terms \"giant cell arteritis\" and \"temporal arteritis\" are sometimes used interchangeably, because of the frequent involvement of the temporal artery. However, other large vessels such as the aorta can be involved. Giant-cell arteritis is also known as \"cranial arteritis\" and \"Horton's disease\". The name (giant cell arteritis) reflects the type of inflammatory cell involved.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31621", "revid": "4076676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31621", "title": "Transient ischemic attack", "text": "Medical condition; minor form of stroke\nMedical condition&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nA transient ischemic attack (TIA), commonly known as a mini-stroke, is a temporary (transient) stroke with noticeable symptoms that end within 24 hours. A TIA causes the same symptoms associated with a stroke, such as weakness or numbness on one side of the body, sudden dimming or loss of vision, difficulty speaking or understanding language or slurred speech.\nAll forms of stroke, including a TIA, result from a disruption in blood flow to the central nervous system. A TIA is caused by a temporary disruption in blood flow to the brain, or cerebral blood flow (CBF). The primary difference between a major stroke and a TIA's minor stroke is how much tissue death (infarction) can be detected afterwards through medical imaging. While a TIA must by definition be associated with symptoms, strokes can also be asymptomatic or silent. In a silent stroke, also known as a \"silent cerebral infarct\" (SCI), there is permanent infarction detectable on imaging, but there are no immediately observable symptoms. The same person can have major strokes, minor strokes, and silent strokes, in any order.\nThe occurrence of a TIA is a risk factor for having a major stroke, and many people with TIA have a major stroke within 48 hours of the TIA. All forms of stroke are associated with increased risk of death or disability. Recognition that a TIA has occurred is an opportunity to start treatment, including medications and lifestyle changes, to prevent future strokes.\nSigns and symptoms.\nSigns and symptoms of TIA are widely variable and can mimic other neurologic conditions, making the clinical context and physical exam crucial in ruling in or out the diagnosis. The most common presenting symptoms of TIA are focal neurologic deficits, which can include, but are not limited to:\nNumbness or weakness generally occurs on the opposite side of the body from the affected hemisphere of the brain.\nA detailed neurologic exam, including a thorough cranial nerve exam, is important to identify these findings and to differentiate them from mimickers of TIA. Symptoms such as unilateral weakness, amaurosis fugax, and double vision have higher odds of representing TIA compared to memory loss, headache, and blurred vision. Below is a table of symptoms at presentation, and what percentage of the time they are seen in TIAs versus conditions that mimic TIA. In general, focal deficits make TIA more likely, but the absence of focal findings do not exclude the diagnosis, and further evaluation may be warranted if clinical suspicion for TIA is high (see \"Diagnosis\" section below).\nTIA vis-\u00e0-vis mimics.\nNon-focal symptoms such as amnesia, confusion, incoordination of limbs, unusual cortical visual symptoms (such as isolated bilateral blindness or bilateral positive visual phenomena), headaches and transient loss of consciousness are usually not associated with TIA, however patient assessment is still needed. Public awareness on the need to seek a medical assessment for these non-focal symptoms is also low, and can result in a delay by patients to seek treatment\nSymptoms of TIAs can last on the order of minutes to one\u2013two hours, but occasionally may last for a longer period of time. TIA is defined as ischemic events in the brain that last less than 24 hours. Given the variation in duration of symptoms, this definition holds less significance. A pooled study of 808 patients with TIAs from 10 hospitals showed that 60% lasted less than one hour, 71% lasted less than two hours, and 14% lasted greater than six hours. Importantly, patients with symptoms that last more than one hour are more likely to have permanent neurologic damage, making prompt diagnosis and treatment important to maximize recovery.\nCause.\nThe most common underlying pathology leading to TIA and stroke is a cardiac condition called atrial fibrillation, where poor coordination of heart contraction may lead to the formation of a clot in the atrial chamber that can become dislodged and travel to a cerebral artery. Unlike in stroke, the blood flow can become restored prior to infarction which leads to the resolution of neurologic symptoms. Another common culprit of TIA is an atherosclerotic plaque located in the common carotid artery, typically by the bifurcation between the internal and external carotids, that becomes an embolism to the brain vasculature similar to the clot in the prior example. A portion of the plaque can become dislodged and lead to embolic pathology in the cerebral vessels.\nIn-situ thrombosis, an obstruction that forms directly in the cerebral vasculature unlike the remote embolism previously mentioned, is another vascular occurrence with possible presentation as TIA. Also, carotid stenosis secondary to atherosclerosis narrowing the diameter of the lumen and thus limiting blood flow is another common cause of TIA. Individuals with carotid stenosis may present with TIA symptoms, thus labeled symptomatic, while others may not experience symptoms and be asymptomatic.\nRisk factors.\nRisk factors associated with TIA are categorized as modifiable or non-modifiable. Non-modifiable risk factors include age greater than 55, sex, family history, genetics, and race/ethnicity. Modifiable risk factors include cigarette smoking, hypertension (elevated blood pressure), diabetes, hyperlipidemia, level of carotid artery stenosis (asymptomatic or symptomatic) and activity level. The modifiable risk factors are commonly targeted in treatment options to attempt to minimize risk of TIA and stroke.\nPathogenesis.\nThere are three major mechanisms of ischemia in the brain: embolism traveling to the brain, in situ thrombotic occlusion in the intracranial vessels supplying the parenchyma of the brain, and stenosis of vessels leading to poor perfusion secondary to flow-limiting diameter. Globally, the vessel most commonly affected is the middle cerebral artery. Embolisms can originate from multiple parts of the body.\nCommon mechanisms of stroke and TIA:\nDiagnosis.\nThe initial clinical evaluation of a suspected TIA involves obtaining a history and physical exam (including a neurological exam). History taking includes defining the symptoms and looking for mimicking symptoms as described above. Bystanders can be very helpful in describing the symptoms and giving details about when they started and how long they lasted. The time course (onset, duration, and resolution), precipitating events, and risk factors are particularly important.\nThe definition, and therefore the diagnosis, has changed over time. TIA was classically based on duration of neurological symptoms. The current widely accepted definition is called \"tissue-based\" because it is based on imaging, not time. The American Heart Association and the American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) now define TIA as a brief episode of neurological dysfunction with a vascular cause, with clinical symptoms typically lasting less than one hour, and without evidence of significant infarction on imaging.\nLaboratory workup.\nLaboratory tests should focus on ruling out metabolic conditions that may mimic TIA (e.g., low blood sugar), in addition to further evaluating a patient's risk factors for ischemic events. All patients should receive a complete blood count with platelet count, blood glucose, basic metabolic panel, prothrombin time/international normalized ratio, and activated partial thromboplastin time as part of their initial workup. These tests help with screening for bleeding or hypercoagulable conditions. Other lab tests, such as a full hypercoagulable state workup or serum drug screening, should be considered based on the clinical situation and factors, such as the age of the patient and family history. A fasting lipid panel is also appropriate to thoroughly evaluate the patient's risk for atherosclerotic disease and ischemic events in the future. Other lab tests may be indicated based on the history and presentation; such as obtaining inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein) to evaluate for giant cell arteritis (which can mimic a TIA) in those presenting with headaches and monocular blindness.\nCardiac rhythm monitoring.\nAn electrocardiogram is necessary to rule out abnormal heart rhythms, such as atrial fibrillation, that can predispose patients to clot formation and embolic events. Hospitalized patients should be placed on heart rhythm telemetry, which is a continuous form of monitoring that can detect abnormal heart rhythms. Prolonged heart rhythm monitoring (such as with a Holter monitor or implantable heart monitoring) can be considered to rule out arrhythmias like paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that may lead to clot formation and TIAs, however this should be considered if other causes of TIA have not been found.\nImaging.\nAccording to guidelines from the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association Stroke Council, patients with TIA should have head imaging \"within 24 hours of symptom onset, preferably with magnetic resonance imaging, including diffusion sequences\". MRI is a better imaging modality for TIA than computed tomography (CT), as it is better able to pick up both new and old ischemic lesions than CT. CT, however, is more widely available and can be used particularly to rule out intracranial hemorrhage. Diffusion sequences can help further localize the area of ischemia and can serve as prognostic indicators. Presence of ischemic lesions on diffusion weighted imaging has been correlated with a higher risk of stroke after a TIA.\nVessels in the head and neck may also be evaluated to look for atherosclerotic lesions that may benefit from interventions, such as carotid endarterectomy. The vasculature can be evaluated through the following imaging modalities: magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), CT angiography (CTA), and carotid ultrasonography/transcranial doppler ultrasonography. Carotid ultrasonography is often used to screen for carotid artery stenosis, as it is more readily available, is noninvasive, and does not expose the person being evaluated to radiation. However, all of the above imaging methods have variable sensitivities and specificities, making it important to supplement one of the imaging methods with another to help confirm the diagnosis (for example: screen for the disease with ultrasonography, and confirm with CTA). Confirming a diagnosis of carotid artery stenosis is important because the treatment for this condition, carotid endarterectomy, can pose significant risk to the patient, including heart attacks and strokes after the procedure. For this reason, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) \"recommends against screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis in the general adult population\". This recommendation is for asymptomatic patients, so it does not necessarily apply to patients with TIAs as these may in fact be a symptom of underlying carotid artery disease (see \"Causes and Pathogenesis\" above). Therefore, patients who have had a TIA may opt to have a discussion with their clinician about the risks and benefits of screening for carotid artery stenosis, including the risks of surgical treatment of this condition.\nCardiac imaging can be performed if head and neck imaging do not reveal a vascular cause for the patient's TIA (such as atherosclerosis of the carotid artery or other major vessels of the head and neck). Echocardiography can be performed to identify patent foramen ovale (PFO), valvular stenosis, and atherosclerosis of the aortic arch that could be sources of clots causing TIAs, with transesophageal echocardiography being more sensitive than transthoracic echocardiography in identifying these lesions.\nPrevention.\nAlthough there is a lack of robust studies demonstrating the efficacy of lifestyle changes in preventing TIA, many medical professionals recommend them. These include:\nIn addition, it is important to control any underlying medical conditions that may increase the risk of stroke or TIA, including:\nTreatment.\nBy definition, TIAs are transient, self-resolving, and do not cause permanent impairment. However, they are associated with an increased risk of subsequent ischemic strokes, which can be permanently disabling. Therefore, management centers on the prevention of future ischemic strokes and addressing any modifiable risk factors. The optimal regimen depends on the underlying cause of the TIA.\nLifestyle modification.\nLifestyle changes have not been shown to reduce the risk of stroke after TIA. While no studies have looked at the optimal diet for secondary prevention of stroke, some observational studies have shown that a Mediterranean diet can reduce stroke risk in patients without cerebrovascular disease. A Mediterranean diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and limited in red meats and sweets. Vitamin supplementation is not useful in secondary stroke prevention.\nAntiplatelet medications.\nThe antiplatelet medications, aspirin and clopidogrel, are both recommended for secondary prevention of stroke after high-risk TIAs. The clopidogrel can generally be stopped after 10 to 21 days. An exception is TIAs due to blood clots originating from the heart, in which case anticoagulants are generally recommended. After TIA or minor stroke, aspirin therapy has been shown to reduce the short-term risk of recurrent stroke by 60\u201370%, and the long-term risk of stroke by 13%.\nThe typical therapy may include aspirin alone, a combination of aspirin plus extended-release dipyridamole, or clopidogrel alone. Clopidogrel and aspirin have similar efficacies and side effect profiles. Clopidogrel is more expensive and has a slightly decreased risk of GI bleed. Another antiplatelet, ticlopidine, is rarely used due to increased side effects.\nAnticoagulant medications.\nAnticoagulants may be started if the TIA is thought to be attributable to atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is an abnormal heart rhythm that may cause the formation of blood clots that can travel to the brain, resulting in TIAs or ischemic strokes. Atrial fibrillation increases stroke risk by five times, and is thought to cause 10-12% of all ischemic strokes in the US. Anticoagulant therapy can decrease the relative risk of ischemic stroke in those with atrial fibrillation by 67% Direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), such as apixaban, are as effective as warfarin while also conferring a lower risk of bleeding. Generally, anticoagulants and antiplatelets are not used in combination, as they result in increased bleeding risk without a decrease in stroke risk. However, combined antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy may be warranted if the patient has symptomatic coronary artery disease in addition to atrial fibrillation.\nSometimes, myocardial infarction (\"heart attack\") may lead to the formation of a blood clot in one of the chambers of the heart. If this is thought to be the cause of the TIA, people may be temporarily treated with warfarin or another anticoagulant to decrease the risk of future stroke.\nBlood pressure control.\nBlood pressure control may be indicated after a TIA to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke. About 70% of patients with recent ischemic stroke are found to have hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt; 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &gt; 90 mmHg. Until the first half of the 2010s, blood pressure goals have generally been SBP &lt; 140 mmHg and DBP &lt; 90 mmHg. However, newer studies suggest that a goal of SBP &lt;130 mmHg may confer even greater benefit. Blood pressure control is often achieved using diuretics or a combination of diuretics and angiotensin converter enzyme inhibitors, although the optimal treatment regimen depends on the individual.\nStudies that evaluated the application of blood pressure\u2010lowering drugs in people who had a TIA or stroke concluded that this type of medication helps to reduce the possibility of a recurrent stroke, a major vascular event, and dementia. The effects achieved in stroke recurrence were mainly obtained through the ingestion of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or a diuretic.\nCholesterol control.\nThere is inconsistent evidence regarding the effect of LDL-cholesterol levels on stroke risk after TIA. Elevated cholesterol may increase ischemic stroke risk while decreasing the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. While its role in stroke prevention is unclear, statin therapy has been shown to reduce all-cause mortality and may be recommended after TIA.\nDiabetes control.\nDiabetes mellitus increases the risk of ischemic stroke by 1.5\u20133.7 times, and may account for at least 8% of first ischemic strokes. While intensive glucose control can prevent certain complications of diabetes, such as kidney damage and retinal damage, there has previously been little evidence that it decreases the risk of stroke or death. However, data from 2017 suggests that metformin, pioglitazone and semaglutide may reduce stroke risk.\nSurgery.\nIf the TIA affects an area that is supplied by the carotid arteries, a carotid ultrasound scan may demonstrate stenosis, or narrowing, of the carotid artery. For people with extra-cranial carotid stenosis, if 70-99% of the carotid artery is clogged, carotid endarterectomy can decrease the five-year risk of ischemic stroke by approximately half. For those with extra-cranial stenosis between 50 and 69%, carotid endarterectomy decreases the 5-year risk of ischemic stroke by about 16%. For those with extra-cranial stenosis less than 50%, carotid endarterectomy does not reduce stroke risk and may, in some cases, increase it. The effectiveness of carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting in reducing stroke risk in people with intracranial carotid artery stenosis is unknown.\nIn carotid endarterectomy, a surgeon makes an incision in the neck, opens up the carotid artery, and removes the plaque occluding the blood vessel. The artery may then be repaired by adding a graft from another vessel in the body or a woven patch. In patients who undergo carotid endarterectomy after a TIA or minor stroke, the 30-day risk of death or stroke is 7%.\nCarotid artery stenting is a less invasive alternative to carotid endarterectomy for people with extra-cranial carotid artery stenosis. In this procedure, the surgeon makes a small cut in the groin and threads a small flexible tube, called a catheter, into the patient's carotid artery. A balloon is inflated at the site of stenosis, opening up the clogged artery to allow for increased blood flow to the brain. To keep the vessel open, a small wire mesh coil, called a stent, may be inflated along with the balloon. The stent remains in place, and the balloon is removed.\nFor people with symptomatic carotid stenosis, carotid endarterectomy is associated with fewer perioperative deaths or strokes than carotid artery stenting. Following the procedure, there is no difference in effectiveness if you compare carotid endarterectomy and carotid stenting procedures, however, endarterectomy is often the procedure of choice as it is a safer procedure and is often effective in the longer term for preventing recurrent stroke. For people with asymptomatic carotid stenosis, the increased risk of stroke or death during the stenting procedure compared to an endarterectomy is less certain.\nPeople who undergo carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting for stroke prevention are medically managed with antiplatelets, statins, and other interventions as well.\nPrognosis.\nWithout treatment, the risk of an ischemic stroke in the three months after a TIA is about 20% with the greatest risk occurring within two days of the TIA.\u00a0 Other sources cite that 10% of TIAs will develop into a stroke within 90 days, half of which will occur in the first two days following the TIA. Treatment and preventative measures after a TIA (for example treating elevated blood pressure) can reduce the subsequent risk of an ischemic stroke by about 80%. The risk of a stroke occurring after a TIA can be predicted using the ABCD\u00b2 score. One limitation of the ABCD\u00b2 score is that it does not reliably predict the level of carotid artery stenosis, which is a major cause of stroke in TIA patients. The patient's age is the most reliable risk factor in predicting any level of carotid stenosis in transient ischemic attack. The ABCD2 score is no longer recommended for triage (to decide between outpatient management versus hospital admission) of those with a suspected TIA due to these limitations.\nEpidemiology.\nWith the difficulty in diagnosing a TIA due to its nonspecific symptoms of neurologic dysfunction at presentation and a differential diagnosis including many mimics, the exact incidence of the disease is unclear. It was estimated to have an incidence of approximately 200,000 to 500,000 cases per year in the US in the early 2000s according to the American Heart Association. TIA incidence trends similarly to stroke, such that incidence varies with age, gender, and different race/ethnicity populations. Associated risk factors include age greater than or equal to 60, blood pressure greater than or equal to 140 systolic or 90 diastolic, and comorbid diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and atrial fibrillation. It is thought that approximately 15 to 30 percent of strokes have a preceding TIA episode associated.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The adjective \"transverse\" implies that the spinal inflammation (myelitis) extends horizontally throughout the cross section of the spinal cord; the terms \"partial transverse myelitis\" and \"partial myelitis\" are sometimes used to specify inflammation that affects only part of the width of the spinal cord. TM is characterized by weakness and numbness of the limbs, deficits in sensation and motor skills, dysfunctional urethral and anal sphincter activities, and dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system that can lead to episodes of high blood pressure. Signs and symptoms vary according to the affected level of the spinal cord. The underlying cause of TM is unknown. The spinal cord inflammation seen in TM has been associated with various infections, immune system disorders, or damage to nerve fibers, by loss of myelin. As opposed to leukomyelitis which affects only the white matter, it affects the entire cross-section of the spinal cord. Decreased electrical conductivity in the nervous system can result.\nSigns and symptoms.\nSymptoms include weakness and numbness of the limbs, deficits in sensation and motor skills, dysfunctional urethral and anal sphincter activities, and dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system that can lead to episodes of high blood pressure. Symptoms typically develop for hours to a few weeks. Sensory symptoms of TM may include a sensation of pins and needles traveling up from the feet. The degree and type of sensory loss will depend upon the extent of the involvement of the various sensory tracts, but there is often a \"sensory level\" at the spinal ganglion of the segmental spinal nerve, below which sensation of pain or light touch is impaired. Motor weakness occurs due to the involvement of the pyramidal tracts and mainly affects the muscles that flex the legs and extend the arms.\nDisturbances in sensory nerves and motor nerves and dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system at the level of the lesion or below, are noted. Therefore, the signs and symptoms depend on the area of the spine involved. Back pain can occur at the level of any inflamed segment of the spinal cord.\nIf the upper cervical segment of the spinal cord is involved, all four limbs may be affected and there is the risk of respiratory failure \u2013 the phrenic nerve which is formed by the cervical spinal nerves C3, C4, and C5 innervates the main muscle of respiration, the diaphragm.\nLesions of the lower cervical region (C5\u2013T1) will cause a combination of upper and lower motor neuron signs in the upper limbs, and exclusively upper motor neuron signs in the lower limbs. Cervical lesions account for about 20% of cases.\nA lesion of the thoracic segment (T1\u201312) will produce upper motor neuron signs in the lower limbs, presenting as a spastic paraparesis. This is the most common location of the lesion, and therefore most individuals will have weakness in the lower limbs.\nA lesion of the lumbar segment, the lower part of the spinal cord (L1\u2013S5) often produces a combination of upper and lower motor neuron signs in the lower limbs. Lumbar lesions account for about 10% of cases.\nCauses.\nTM is a heterogeneous condition, that is, there are several identified causes. Sometimes the term \"Transverse myelitis spectrum disorder\" is used. In 60% of patients the cause is idiopathic. In rare cases, it may be associated with meningococcal meningitis\nWhen it appears as a comorbid condition with neuromyelitis optica (NMO), it is considered to be caused by NMO-IgG autoimmunity, and when it appears in multiple sclerosis (MS) cases, it's misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis (MS) or seen as a type of MS. But NMO is a different condition.\nOther causes of TM include infections, immune system disorders, and demyelinating diseases. Viral infections known to be associated with TM include HIV, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr. Flavivirus infections such as Zika virus and West Nile virus have also been associated. Viral association of transverse myelitis could result from the infection itself or from the response to it. Bacterial causes associated with TM include \"Mycoplasma pneumoniae\", \"Bartonella henselae\", and the types of \"Borrelia\" that cause Lyme disease. Lyme disease gives rise to neuroborreliosis which is seen in a small percentage (4 to 5 per cent) of acute transverse myelitis cases. The diarrhea-causing bacteria \"Campylobacter jejuni\" is also a reported cause of transverse myelitis.\nOther associated causes include the helminth infection schistosomiasis, spinal cord injuries, vascular disorders that impede the blood flow through vessels of the spinal cord, and paraneoplastic syndrome. Another exceptionally rare cause is heroin associated transverse myelitis.\nPathophysiology.\nThis progressive loss of the fatty myelin sheath surrounding the nerves in the affected spinal cord occurs for unclear reasons following infections or due to multiple sclerosis. Infections may cause TM through direct tissue damage or by immune-mediated infection-triggered tissue damage. The lesions present are usually inflammatory. Spinal cord involvement is usually central, uniform, and symmetric in comparison to multiple sclerosis which typically affects the cord in a patchy way. The lesions in acute TM are mostly limited to the spinal cord with no involvement of other structures in the central nervous system.\nLongitudinally extensive transverse myelitis.\nA proposed special clinical presentation is the \"longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis\" (LETM), which is defined as a TM with a spinal cord lesion that extends over three or more vertebral segments. The causes of LETM are also heterogeneous and the presence of MOG auto-antibodies has been proposed as a diagnostic biomarker.\nDiagnosis.\nDiagnostic criteria.\nIn 2002, the Transverse Myelitis Consortium Working Group proposed the following diagnostic criteria for idiopathic acute transverse myelitis:\nInvestigations.\nIndividuals who develop TM are typically transferred to a neurologist who can urgently investigate the patient in a hospital. If breathing is affected, particularly in upper spinal cord lesions, methods of artificial ventilation must be on hand before and during the transfer procedure. The patient should also be catheterized to test for and, if necessary, drain an over-distended bladder. A lumbar puncture can be performed after the MRI or at the time of CT myelography. Corticosteroids are often given in high doses when symptoms begin with the hope that the degree of inflammation and swelling of the spinal cord will be lessened, but whether this is truly effective is still debated.\nDifferential diagnosis.\nThe differential diagnosis of acute TM includes demyelinating disorders, such as multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica, infections, such as herpes zoster and herpes simplex virus, and other types of inflammatory disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and neurosarcoidosis. It is important to also rule out an acute cause of compression on the spinal cord.\nTreatment.\nIf treated early, some people experience a complete or near complete recovery. Treatment options also vary according to the underlying cause. One treatment option includes plasmapheresis. Recovery from TM is variable between individuals and also depends on the underlying cause. Some patients begin to recover between weeks 2 and 12 following onset and may continue to improve for up to two years. Other patients may never show signs of recovery.\nPrognosis.\nThe prognosis for TM depends on whether there is improvement in 3 to 6 months. Complete recovery is unlikely if no improvement occurs within this time. Incomplete recovery can still occur; however, aggressive physical therapy and rehabilitation will be very important. One-third of people with TM experience full recovery, one-third experience fair recovery but have significant neurological deficits, such as spastic gait. The final third experience no recovery at all.\nEpidemiology.\nThe incidence of TM is 4.6 per 1 million per year, affecting men and women equally. TM can occur at any age, but there are peaks around age 10, age 20, and after age 40.\nHistory.\nThe earliest reports describing the signs and symptoms of transverse myelitis were published in 1882 and 1910 by the English neurologist Henry Bastian.\nIn 1928, Frank Ford noted that in mumps patients who developed acute myelitis, symptoms only emerged after the mumps infection and associated symptoms began to recede. In an article in The Lancet, Ford suggested that acute myelitis could be a post-infection syndrome in most cases (i.e. a result of the body's immune response attacking and damaging the spinal cord) rather than an infectious disease where a virus or some other infectious agent caused paralysis. His suggestion was consistent with reports in 1922 and 1923 of rare instances in which patients developed \"post-vaccinal encephalomyelitis\" subsequent to receiving the rabies vaccine which then was made from brain tissue carrying the virus. The pathological examination of those who had died from the disease revealed inflammatory cells and demyelination as opposed to the vascular lesions predicted by Bastian.\nFord's theory of an allergic response being at the root of the disease was later shown to be only partially correct, as some infectious agents such as mycoplasma, measles and rubella were isolated from the spinal fluid of some infected patients, suggesting that direct infection could contribute to the manifestation of acute myelitis in certain cases.\nIn 1948, Dr. Suchett-Kaye described a patient with rapidly progressing impairment of lower extremity motor function that developed as a complication of pneumonia. In his description, he coined the term transverse myelitis to reflect the band-like thoracic area of altered sensation that patients reported. The term 'acute transverse myelopathy' has since emerged as an acceptable synonym for 'transverse myelitis', and the two terms are currently used interchangeably in the literature.\nThe definition of transverse myelitis has also evolved over time. Bastian's initial description included few conclusive diagnostic criteria; by the 1980s, basic diagnostic criteria were established, including acutely developing paraparesis combined with bilateral spinal cord dysfunction for &lt;4 weeks and a well-defined upper sensory level, no evidence of spinal cord compression, and a stable, non-progressive course. Later definitions, were written to exclude patients with underlying systemic or neurological illnesses and to include only those who progressed to maximum deficit in fewer than 4 weeks.\nSociety and culture.\nIn 2016, former Slipknot drummer Joey Jordison revealed that he had been hospitalised by the disease in 2013 and that this was the reason for his controversial firing. As the first celebrity to publicly speak about having transverse myelitis, this helped to raise public awareness of the disease. Jordison died in his sleep on July 26, 2021, however it is not known whether the disease had any connection to his death.\nEtymology.\nThe term is from Neo-Latin: \"myelitis transversa\"; the disorder's name is derived from Greek {{transliteration|el|\"myel\u00f3s\"}}, \"marrow\", referring to the \"spinal cord\", and the suffix \"-itis\", which denotes inflammation."}

It is the sequel to his \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" (1865), in which many of the characters were anthropomorphic playing cards. In this second novel the theme is chess. As in the earlier book, the central figure, Alice, enters a fantastical world, this time by climbing through a large looking-glass (a mirror) into a world that she can see beyond it. There she finds that, just as in a reflection, things are reversed, including logic (for example, running helps one remain stationary, walking away from something brings one towards it, chessmen are alive and nursery-rhyme characters are real). \nAmong the characters Alice meets are the severe Red Queen, the gentle and flustered White Queen, the quarrelsome twins Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the rude and opinionated Humpty Dumpty, and the kindly but impractical White Knight. Eventually, as in the earlier book, after a succession of strange adventures, Alice wakes and realises she has been dreaming. As in \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\", the original illustrations are by John Tenniel.\nThe book contains several verse passages, including \"Jabberwocky\", \"The Walrus and the Carpenter\" and the White Knight's ballad, \"A-sitting On a Gate\". Like \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\", the book introduces phrases that have become common currency, including \"jam to-morrow and jam yesterday \u2013 but never jam to-day\", \"sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast\", \"un-birthday presents\", \"portmanteau words\" and \"as large as life and twice as natural\".\n\"Through the Looking Glass\" has been adapted for the stage and the screen and translated into many languages. Critical opinion of the book has generally been favourable and either ranked it on a par with its predecessor or else only just short of it.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBackground and first publication.\nAlthough by 1871 Lewis Carroll had published several books and papers under his real name \u2013 Charles Lutwidge Dodgson \u2013 they had all been scholarly works about mathematics, on which he lectured at the University of Oxford. Under his pseudonym he had published \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" (1865), the work for which he was known to the wider public. That book was greatly different from much Victorian literature for children, which was frequently didactic and moralistic, sometimes displaying religious fervour and emphasising human sinfulness. \"The Oxford Companion to English Literature\" describes Carroll's book as \"a landmark 'nonsense' text, liberating children from didactic fiction\". A reviewer at the time of publication commented that the book \"has no moral, and does not teach anything. It is without any of that bitter foundation which some people imagine ought to be at the bottom of all children's books\". Another wrote, \"If there be such a thing as perfection in children's tales, we should be tempted to say that Mr Carroll had reached it\". The book sold in large numbers, and within a year of its publication Carroll was contemplating a sequel.\n\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" had grown from stories Carroll improvised for Alice Liddell and her sisters, the daughters of his Oxford neighbours Henry and Lorina Liddell. The proposed sequel had fewer such sources to draw on and was planned from the outset for publication. When Lorina Liddell became pregnant again the three children were sent to stay with their maternal grandmother at her house, Hetton Lawn, in Charlton Kings, near Cheltenham, where Carroll visited them. Above the drawing-room fireplace there was an enormous looking-glass (in more modern terms, a mirror). Carroll's biographer Morton N. Cohen suggests that it may have inspired the idea of climbing up to the chimney-piece and going through to the other side of the looking-glass. This was not confirmed by Carroll and nor was an alternative account stating that the looking-glass theme was suggested by another Alice \u2013 Carroll's cousin Alice Raikes \u2013 who recalled being in his company as a child and standing in front of a long mirror, holding an orange in her right hand. Carroll asked her in which hand the little girl in the mirror held it, and she replied, \"The left hand\u00a0... but if I was on the other side of the glass, wouldn't the orange still be in my right?\"\nIn August 1866 Carroll wrote to his publisher, Alexander MacMillan, \"It will probably be some time before I again indulge in paper and print. I have, however, a floating idea of writing a sort of sequel to Alice\". He developed the idea, working slowly and intermittently; in February 1867 he told Macmillan, \"I am hoping before long to complete another book about Alice.\u00a0... You would not, I presume, object to publish the book, if it should ever reach completion\". In January 1869 he sent Macmillan the first completed chapter of the new book, tentatively titled \"Behind the Looking-Glass\", and then spent a further year finishing the rest. The title of the book caused him some difficulty. He considered calling it \"Looking-Glass World\", but Macmillan was unenthusiastic. At the suggestion of an Oxford colleague, Henry Liddon, Carroll adopted the title \"Through the Looking-Glass\".\nIllustrations.\nCarroll had great difficulty in finding an illustrator for the book. He first approached John Tenniel, whose drawings for \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" had been well received: \"The Pall Mall Gazette\" said, \"The illustrations by Mr Tenniel are beyond praise. His rabbit, his puppy, his mad hatter are things not to be forgotten\". The collaboration had not been smooth: Carroll was a perfectionist and insisted on minutely controlling all aspects of the production of his books. His publishers, Macmillan &amp; Co, arranged for printing and distribution (for a ten per cent commission), but Carroll paid all the costs \u2013 printing, illustration and advertising \u2013 and made all the decisions. Tenniel was not enthusiastic about working with Carroll again; he said he was too busy as chief cartoonist for \"Punch\" and declined the commission. He suggested one of his predecessors at \"Punch\", Richard Doyle, but Carroll thought him \"no longer good enough\". Other artists considered but rejected were Arthur Hughes and W. S. Gilbert. Macmillan suggested Noel Paton, who had drawn the frontispiece for \"The Water-Babies\", but he declined because of pressure of other work. Eventually Carroll made a second approach to Tenniel, who reluctantly agreed to provide the illustrations for the new book, but only at his own pace. Carroll noted in his diary, \"He thinks it possible (but not likely) that we might get it out by Christmas 1869\".\nThe Wasp in a Wig.\nWhile the book was at proof stage Carroll made a substantial cut of about 1,400 words. The omitted section introduced a wasp wearing a yellow wig and includes a complete five-stanza poem that Carroll did not reuse elsewhere. If included in the book it would have followed, or been included at the end of, Chapter Eight \u2013 the chapter featuring the encounter with the White Knight. Tenniel wrote to Carroll:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;Don't think me brutal, but I am bound to say that the 'wasp' chapter doesn't interest me in the least, &amp; I can't see my way to a picture. If you wish to shorten the book, I can't help thinking \u2013 with all submission \u2013 that \"there\" is your opportunity.\nThe author cut the section. The manuscript has never been found and scholars searched unsuccessfully for years for traces of the missing material. Doubts arose whether it had ever existed, but in 1974 the London auction house Sotheby's offered for sale a batch of galley proofs with handwritten revisions and a note directing the printer to take the section out of the book. The chapter was first published in 1977 in a 37-page book by the Carroll scholar Martin Gardner, issued in New York by the Lewis Carroll Society of North America and in London by Macmillan &amp; Co. It was reproduced in full by the British newspaper \"The Sunday Telegraph\" that September, with notes by Cohen. Although Tenniel had told Carroll that \"a wasp in a wig is altogether beyond the appliances of art\", the text printed by \"The Sunday Telegraph\" was accompanied by illustrations specially drawn or painted by Ralph Steadman, Sir Hugh Casson, Peter Blake and Patrick Procktor.\nPublication.\nOn 4 January 1871 Carroll finished the text, and later that month wrote that the second \"Alice\" book \"has cost me, I think, more trouble than the first, and ought to be equal to it in every way\". Tenniel had yet to produce nearly half the pictures. By the end of the year the book was ready for press. The title page carries the publication date 1872, but \"Through the Looking-Glass\" was on sale in time for Christmas 1871. Within weeks 15,000 copies had been sold. The first American edition was issued by Lee and Sheppard of Boston and New York in 1872.\nCharacters.\nAt the start of the book, Carroll includes a list of \"\"Dramatis Personae\" as arranged before commencement of game\". He then gives notes to the chess game the characters play out in the story.\nFor other characters, see List of minor characters in \"Through the Looking-Glass\".\nPlot.\nAlice progresses across a chessboard-like landscape in which the squares are separated by small brooks. Each time she steps across a brook to a new square in Chapters Three to Nine she finds herself meeting new characters in a self-contained story.\nChapter One. Looking-Glass House.\nOn a snowy November night Alice is sitting in an armchair before the fireplace, playing with a white kitten (\"Snowdrop\") and a black kitten (\"Kitty\"). She talks to Kitty about the game of chess and then speculates what the world is like on the other side of a mirror. Climbing up to the chimney piece, she touches the looking-glass above the fireplace and discovers, to her surprise, that she can step through it: \"In another moment Alice was through the glass, and had jumped lightly down into the Looking-glass room\". She finds herself in a reflected version of her own home and notices a book with looking-glass poetry, \"Jabberwocky\", whose reversed printing she can read only by holding it up to the mirror. In this room her chess pieces have come to life, although they remain small enough for her to pick up.\nChapter Two. The Garden of Live Flowers.\nOn leaving the house Alice enters a sunny spring garden where the flowers can speak. Some of them are quite rude to her. Elsewhere in the garden, she meets the Red Queen, who is now human-sized, and who impresses Alice with her ability to run at breathtaking speeds.\nThe Red Queen explains that the entire countryside is laid out in squares, like a gigantic chessboard, and says that Alice will be a queen if she can advance all the way to the eighth rank on the board. Because the White Queen's pawn, Lily, is too young to play, Alice is placed in the second rank in her stead. The Red Queen leaves her with the advice, \"Speak in French when you can't think of the English for a thing \u2013 turn out your toes when you walk \u2013 and remember who you are!\"\nChapter Three. Looking-Glass Insects.\nAlice finds herself as a passenger on a train that jumps over the third row directly into the fourth. She arrives in a forest where a gnat teaches her about looking glass insects such as the \"Bread-and-butterfly\" and \"Rocking-horsefly\". It then vanishes.\nAlice crosses the \"wood where things have no names\". There she cannot follow the Red Queen's advice \u2013 \"remember who you are\" \u2013 and forgets her own name. Together with a fawn, who has also forgotten who or what he is, she makes her way to the other side, where they both remember everything. The fawn bounds away.\nChapter Four. Tweedledum and Tweedledee.\nAlice follows a signpost pointing to the house of the twin brothers Tweedledum and Tweedledee, names familiar from the nursery rhyme, which she recites:\n&lt;poem&gt;\n Tweedledum and Tweedledee\n Agreed to have a battle;\n For Tweedledum said Tweedledee\n Had spoiled his nice new rattle.\n Just then flew down a monstrous crow,\n As black as a tar-barrel;\n Which frightened both the heroes so,\n They quite forgot their quarrel.&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe brothers insist that Tweedledee should now recite to her \u2013 and they choose the longest poem they know: \"The Walrus and the Carpenter\". Its eighteen stanzas include:\n&lt;poem&gt;\n \"The time has come,\" the Walrus said,\n \"To talk of many things:\n Of shoes, and ships, and sealing-wax \n Of cabbages, and kings \n And why the sea is boiling hot \n And whether pigs have wings\". &lt;/poem&gt;\nA noise that Alice mistakes for the roaring of a wild beast is heard. It is the snoring of the Red King \u2013 sleeping under a nearby tree. The brothers upset her by saying that she is merely an imaginary figure in the Red King's dreams and will vanish when he wakes. The brothers begin equipping themselves for their battle, but are frightened away by the monstrous crow.\nChapter Five. Wool and Water.\nAlice next meets the White Queen, who is absent-minded but can remember future events before they have happened: \"That's the effect of living backwards\u00a0... it always makes one a little giddy at first\". She advises Alice to practise believing impossibilities: \"Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast\".\nAlice and the White Queen advance into the chessboard's fifth rank by crossing over a brook together, but at the moment of the crossing, the Queen suddenly becomes a talking Sheep in a small shop. Alice soon finds herself on water, struggling to handle the oars of a small rowing boat; the Sheep annoys her by shouting about \"crabs\" and \"feathers\". After rowing back to the shop Alice finds trees growing in it, alongside a little brook \u2013 \"Well, this is the very queerest shop I ever saw!\"\nChapter Six. Humpty Dumpty.\nAfter crossing the brook into the sixth rank, Alice encounters the giant egg-shaped Humpty Dumpty, sitting on a wall. He is celebrating his un-birthday, which he explains is one of the 364 days of the year when one might get un-birthday presents. He is quite rude to Alice but provides her with translations of the strange terms in \"Jabberwocky\". In the process, he introduces her to the concept of portmanteau words: \"Well, then, 'mimsy' is 'flimsy and miserable' (there\u2019s another portmanteau for you)\". Just after she has parted company with him he has a great fall: \"a heavy crash shook the forest from end to end\".\nChapter Seven. The Lion and the Unicorn.\nAll the king's horses and all the king's men come to Humpty Dumpty's assistance, and are accompanied by the White King, along with the Lion and the Unicorn. The March Hare and the Hatter appear in the guise of messengers called \"Haigha\" and \"Hatta\", whom the White King employs \"to come and go. One to come, and one to go\".\nThe nursery rhyme about the Lion and the Unicorn ends: \"Some gave them plum-cake and drummed them out of town\". They are starting on the plum-cake when a deafening noise of drumming is heard.\nChapter Eight. \"It's My Own Invention\".\nAlarmed by the noise, Alice crosses another brook, reaching the seventh rank and the forested territory of the Red Knight, who seeks to capture her, but the White Knight comes to her rescue, though repeatedly falling off his horse. He is an inveterate inventor of useless things. Escorting Alice through the forest towards the final brook-crossing, he recites \"A-sitting on a Gate\", a poem of his own composition. Carroll writes in this chapter:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;Of all the strange things that Alice saw in her journey Through The Looking-Glass, this was the one that she always remembered most clearly. Years afterwards she could bring the whole scene back again, as if it had been only yesterday \u2013 the mild blue eyes and kindly smile of the Knight \u2013 the setting sun gleaming through his hair, and shining on his armour in a blaze of light that quite dazzled her \u2013 the horse quietly moving about, with the reins hanging loose on his neck, cropping the grass at her feet.\nChapter Nine. Queen Alice.\nBidding farewell to the White Knight, Alice steps across the last brook, and is automatically a queen; a golden crown materialises on her head. She is joined by the White and Red Queens, who invite each other to a party that will be hosted by Alice. The two fall asleep.\nAlice arrives at a doorway over which are the words \"Queen Alice\" in large letters. She goes in and finds her banquet already in progress. There are three chairs at the head of the table; the Red and White Queens are seated in two of them; the middle one is empty and Alice sits in it. She attempts a speech of thanks to her guests but the banquet becomes chaotic. Crying \"I can't stand this any longer!\" Alice jumps up and seizes the table-cloth, pulls it and plates, dishes, guests, and candles come crashing down in a heap. She blames the Red Queen for everything:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\"And as for you,\" she went on, turning fiercely upon the Red Queen, whom she considered as the cause of all the mischief \u2013 but the Queen was no longer at her side \u2013 she had suddenly dwindled down to the size of a little doll, and was now on the table, merrily running round and round after her own shawl, which was trailing behind her. At any other time, Alice would have felt surprised at this, but she was far too much excited to be surprised at anything now. \"As for you,\" she repeated, catching hold of the little creature in the very act of jumping over a bottle which had just lighted upon the table, \"I'll shake you into a kitten, that I will!\"\nChapter Ten. Shaking.\nAlice seizes the Red Queen and begins shaking her\u00a0...\nChapters Eleven. Waking; and Twelve. Which Dreamed It?\n...\u00a0and awakes in her armchair to find herself holding Kitty, who, she concludes, has been the Red Queen all along, Snowdrop having been the White Queen. Alice then recalls the\u00a0speculation of Tweedledum and Tweedledee that everything may have been a dream of the Red King. \"He was part of my dream, of course \u2013 but then I was part of his dream, too!\" Carroll leaves the reader with the question, \"Which do\" you\" think it was?\"\nThemes.\n\"Through the Looking-Glass\" builds on the first book's themes of language, linguistic puzzles and wordplay. The poet W. H. Auden commented that words in the \"Alice\" books \"have a life and a will of their own\". Carroll's linguistic games parody the incoherence of real-world institutions and social structures. Like its predecessor, the book has legalistic elements that convey how systems of order can appear structured but remain completely arbitrary. As in a symmetrical chess game, many aspects of the story are mirrored or inverted. Cause and effect are often reversed: for example, Alice can only reach the Red Queen by walking in reverse. \"Through the Looking Glass\" juxtaposes sense with nonsense and sanity with insanity. The more consistent rules of \"Through the Looking Glass\" cast Alice more clearly as a child intruding into an adult world, and capable of seeing through the arbitrary nature of the social structures. The book pays more attention to the passage of time and has moments of playful rebellion against the adult world along with melancholy for the coming end of Alice's childhood: the beginning and end both have themes of winter and death, linked with the end of childhood.\nChess.\nWhereas the first \"Alice\" novel has playing cards as a theme, \"Through the Looking-Glass\" uses chess; many of the main characters are represented by chess pieces, Alice being a pawn. The looking-glass world consists of square fields divided by brooks or streams, and the crossing of each brook signifies a change in scene, Alice advancing one square. \nAt the beginning of the book Carroll provides and explains a chess composition, corresponding to the events of the story. Although the moves follow the rules of chess, other basic rules are ignored: one player (White) makes several consecutive moves, and a late check is left undealt with. Carroll also explains that certain items listed in the composition do not have corresponding piece moves but simply refer to the story, e.g. the \"castling of the three Queens, which is merely a way of saying that they entered the palace\".\nParody, caricature and coinages.\n\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" contains several parodies of Victorian poetry, but in \"Through the Looking-Glass\" there is only one: the White Knight\u2019s ballad, described by the literary critic Harold Bloom as \"a superb and loving parody of Wordsworth's great crisis-poem 'Resolution and Independence'\". Beverly Lyon Clark, in a study of Carroll's verse, writes that the ballad also contains echoes of Wordsworth's \"The Thorn\" and Thomas Moore's \"My Heart and Lute\".\nWalter Scott's \"Bonny Dundee\" is clearly the basis for \"To the Looking-Glass World it was Alice that Said\", but Carroll simply uses its form and metre rather than parodying it. Although the rhyme scheme and metre of \"The Walrus and the Carpenter\" mirror those of Thomas Hood's ballad \"The Dream of Eugene Aram\", Carroll is not parodying the latter; he commented, \"The metre is a common one\", and said he had no particular poem in mind.\nAs in the earlier book, some of the characters incorporate elements of real people whom the Liddell sisters would have known. The Red Queen (described by the Rose as \"one of the kind that has nine spikes\") is based on their governess, Miss Prickett, known to them as \"Pricks\". The White Knight contains elements of Carroll himself and of a college friend, the chemist and inventor Augustus Vernon Harcourt, although Bloom also finds echoes of \"the kindly, heroic, and benignly mad Don Quixote\". In a 1933 essay Shane Leslie suggests that in \"Through the Looking Glass\" Carroll was satirising the controversial Oxford Movement, which sought to align the Church of England more closely with the Catholic Church, Tweedledum representing \"high church\" reformers and Tweedledee representing \"low church\" opponents of the movement. In Leslie's hypothesis there are other Oxonian and church references, the Sheep, the White Queen and the White King drawing, respectively, on Edward Pusey, J. H. Newman and Benjamin Jowett, the White and Red Knights representing Thomas Huxley and Samuel Wilberforce, and the Jabberwock the Papacy. The theologian and novelist Ronald Knox agreed that the Papacy was a target, maintaining that \"impenetrability\" \u2013 one of Humpty Dumpty's words \u2013 was a joke against the doctrine of papal infallibility.\nLike \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\", the book contains many phrases that became common currency. Here they include \"cabbages and kings\", \"jam to-morrow and jam yesterday \u2013 but never jam to-day\", \"sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast\", \"When I use a word it means just what I choose it to mean\", \"un-birthday presents\", \"portmanteau words\", \"Anglo-Saxon attitudes\" and \"as large as life and twice as natural\".\nAdaptations.\nStage and cinema.\nMost stage and screen adaptations of the Lewis Carroll novels concentrate on the more familiar \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\", although many of them import characters from \"Through the Looking-Glass\". \n\"Through the Looking Glass\" has been adapted at least three times for the theatre. George Grossmith Jr presented a version at the New Theatre in 1903. Nancy Price adapted and presented the piece at the Little Theatre in 1935, and revived it for the Christmas seasons of the next three years. The cast included Frith Banbury (Unicorn), Ernest Butcher (Tweedledee), Michael Martin Harvey (White Knight), Esm\u00e9 Percy (Humpty Dumpty) and Joyce Redman (Tiger Lily). In 1954 a stage adaptation by Felicity Douglas, \"Alice Through the Looking-Glass\", was presented at the Prince's Theatre with a cast including Michael Denison (Tweedledee and Humpty Dumpty), Binnie Hale (Red Queen), Griffith Jones (Tweedledum and Red Knight), Carol Marsh (Alice) and Margaret Rutherford (White Queen). \nA 2016 film titled \"Alice Through the Looking Glass\" uses some of the novel's characters, but the plot is unrelated to it.\nRadio.\nThe first full-cast sound radio version of the book was transmitted on BBC Radio in 1944, with a cast including Esm\u00e9 Percy, Leslie French and Eric Maturin. A further radio version was broadcast as a five-part serial in 1948, with Angela Glynne as Alice, Derek McCulloch as narrator and a cast including Vivienne Chatterton (White Queen), Mary O'Farrell (Red Queen), Carleton Hobbs (Tweedledum and Lion), Norman Shelley (Gnat), Marjorie Westbury (Fawn) and Richard Goolden (White Knight). \nA 1963 adaptation for BBC Network Three had a cast including Peter Sallis (Tweedledee), Peter Pratt (White King) and Geoffrey Bayldon (White Knight). A further five-part adaptation was broadcast on the Home Service in 1964 with Prunella Scales as Alice. BBC Radio 4 broadcast a new adaptation in December 2012, featuring Julian Rhind-Tutt as Carroll and Lauren Mote (Alice), Carole Boyd (Red Queen), Sally Phillips (White Queen), Nicholas Parsons (Humpty Dumpty), Alistair McGowan (Tweedledum and Tweedledee) and John Rowe (White Knight).\nTelevision.\nA musical adaptation for American television in 1966 had a book by Albert Simmons, music by Mark Charlap and lyrics by Elsie Simmons. The cast included Nanette Fabray (White Queen), Agnes Moorehead (Red Queen), Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n (White King), Robert Coote (Red King), Jimmy Durante (Humpty Dumpty), Jack Palance (the Jabberwock) and the Smothers Brothers (Tweedledum and Tweedledee). \nSome characters from \"Through the Looking Glass\" featured in a conflation of both books on BBC Television in 1960, but the first British television adaptation of \"Through the Looking Glass\" was in 1973, featuring Sarah Sutton (Alice), Brenda Bruce (White Queen), Richard Pearson (White King), Judy Parfitt (Red Queen), Geoffrey Bayldon (White Knight) and Freddie Jones (Humpty Dumpty). \nA 1998 television version featured Kate Beckinsale (Alice), Penelope Wilton (White Queen), Geoffrey Palmer (White King), Si\u00e2n Phillips (Red Queen) and Desmond Barrit (Humpty Dumpty).\nOther.\nA dramatised audio version, directed by Douglas Cleverdon, was released in 1959 by Argo Records. The book is narrated by Margaretta Scott, starring Jane Asher as Alice, along with Frank Duncan, Tony Church, Norman Shelley and Carleton Hobbs. The book has been the basis of musical compositions. Deems Taylor wrote an orchestral suite in 1919 with one of the novel's episodes represented in each of its five movements. Alfred Reynolds composed another orchestral suite based on the book in 1947.\nTranslations.\n\"Through the Looking Glass\" has been published in many languages, including Afrikaans, Bengali, Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese and Russian. In French, Tweedledee and Tweedledum have been rendered as \" and \" and Humpty Dumpty as \"\". The Rocking-horse-fly becomes . The opening lines of \"Jabberwocky\":\n&lt;poem&gt;\n 'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\n Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;\n All mimsy were the borogoves\n And the mome raths outgrabe.&lt;/poem&gt;\nbecome in French (present tense):\n&lt;poem&gt;\n \n &lt;/poem&gt;\nand in German, in the earliest of several translations:&lt;poem&gt;\n \n &lt;/poem&gt;\nReception and legacy.\nReception.\nCritical response was highly favourable. \"The Pall Mall Gazette\" singled out \"Jabberwocky\": \"what pleases us most is the stanza with which the ballad begins and ends. Anything more affecting than those lines we rarely meet in the poetry of our day. Once admitted to memory, they will for ever maintain a place there\". As to the book as a whole the paper judged it almost up to the standard of its predecessor \u2013 \"there is not much to choose between them\". Tenniel too was praised: \"Those who remember his picture of the grin of the Cheshire Cat (not the cat, but the grin) will find a similar exercise of his skill in the woodcut representing Alice as she fades through the looking-glass\".\n\"The Illustrated London News\" found the book \"quite as rich in humorous whims of fantasy, quite as laughable in its queer incidents, as lovable for its pleasant spirit and graceful manner\" as its predecessor:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;Humpty Dumpty and that inseparable pair of twins named Tweedledum and Tweedledee, are irresistibly comical, and so are the Lion and the Unicorn fighting for the Crown. Mr. Tenniel's designs, it need scarcely be said, are so good that the little volume would be worth buying for their sake alone.\n\"The Examiner\" found the sequel not quite as good as the original but \"quite good enough to delight every sensible reader of any age\", It praised the \"wit and humour that all children can appreciate, and grown folks ought as thoroughly to enjoy\". \"The Times\" said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;The nonsense almost equals that of its predecessor, and is far more charming than half the literature bought and sold as solid sense. The charm of it is that it answers to its name; there is literally no sense in it, no lurking moral, no covert satire, no meaning, so far as we read it, of any sort whatever; it is at once the lightest and the brightest, and the most utter nonsense.\" \nThe reviewer in a New York newspaper, \"The Independent\", wrote, \"we know no higher praise than to say it is the equal of that charming juvenile \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\"\u00a0... Lewis Carroll has succeeded in giving to his books a purity, a daintiness, and an absolute adaptation to child-wants which are remarkable. Tenniel's illustrations, too, are exquisitely drawn\".\nAmong more recent comments on the book, Daniel Hahn in \"The Oxford Companion to Children's Literature\" (2015) writes that sentimentality plays a larger part in \"Through the Looking Glass\" than in \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\". He instances Alice's encounter with the Fawn in the wood and the description of her picking scented rushes while in the Sheep's boat. In Hahn's view, Alice's farewell to the White Knight has emotional overtones often thought to represent Carroll's sundering from Alice Liddell as she grows up.\nHahn also comments on the levels of threatened violence in the book. \"Jabberwocky\" introduces a note of real horror; and there is a frequent threat of death or dissolution. The oysters in \"The Walrus and The Carpenter\" are all eaten \"despite (or perhaps because of) their childlike innocence\"; and Alice is made to fear that she will disappear if she is in the Red King's dream and he wakes up.\nLegacy.\nAlthough many later writers, including Jean Ingelow, Christina Rossetti, Charles E. Carryl and E. F. Benson, attempted to follow Carroll's lead, \"Through the Looking Glass\", as opposed to \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\", is rarely the identifiable influence. Lawrence Durrell draws on \"Jabberwocky\" in his collection of comic short stories (1966): \"You can damn well take a hundred lines, Dovebasket\u00a0... 'In future I must not be such a blasted Borogrove'\". Douglas Adams, in his \"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" series, borrows from the White Queen: \"If you\u2019ve done six impossible things this morning, why not round it off with breakfast at Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe?\" Adams's character Mr Prosser shares Alice's concern about being a mere figment of someone else's dream: \"He felt that his whole life was some kind of dream and he sometimes wondered whose it was and whether they were enjoying it\". A disembodied quiet voice talks to Adams's Zaphod Beeblebrox in much the same way as the gnat in \"Through the Looking Glass\" talks quietly in Alice's ear. \nAngus Wilson drew on \"Through the Looking Glass\" for the title of his 1956 novel \"Anglo-Saxon Attitudes\" but otherwise his book has nothing to do with Carroll's story. Another title drawn from Carroll's book is the Red Queen hypothesis \u2013 derived from her words to Alice \"It takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!\" \u2013 that to survive, a species must evolve rapidly enough to counter evolutionary changes in ecologically competing species. \"The Oxford Companion to Children's Literature\" cites the \"Alice\" books \u2013 not specifically the second \u2013 as important influences on L. Frank Baum's \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" (1900), and comments, \"\"The Phantom Tollbooth\" (1961) by Norton Juster recaptures the \"Alice\" style more naturally than do most other imitations (though according to Juster, he had never read \"Alice\" at the time he wrote it)\".\nNotes, references and sources.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

While this book contains some history of the Nephites, including the death of Nephi, it is mainly a record of Jacob's preaching to his people. Chapter 5 contains the Parable of the Olive Tree, a lengthy allegory of the scattering and gathering of Israel, comparing the Israelites and gentiles to tame and wild olive trees, respectively. Jacob is seven chapters long. \nAccording to Grant Hardy, professor of religious studies, Jacob 4-6 mirrors the structure of Nephi's teachings in Second Nephi. He begins with a testimony of Christ, quotes the Brass Plates, and interprets what he has shared. Jacob's focus, unlike Nephi's focus on Isaiah, is on Zenos.\nNarrative.\nThe book of Jacob can be divided into four parts:\nTransition to Jacob's leadership.\nThe prophet Nephi grows old and transfers record keeping responsibility to Jacob. He instructs Jacob to only record spiritually important events, and Jacob writes that the goal of his writing is to convince the people to \"come unto Christ.\" Nephi dies, and rulers succeeding him are called \"second\" and \"third\" Nephi respectively. Jacob explains that he uses the term \"Nephite\" to refer to anyone who is friendly to the people of Nephi.\nJacob's sermon in the temple.\nJacob offers a speech in the temple in his office of priest and teacher. He identifies three wicked practices among the Nephites: desiring polygamy, or multiple wives, searching out gold and silver, and being prideful. To combat these tendencies, Jacob counsels the people to free captive people and take care of the hungry, poor, and sick. He says that the practice of having multiple wives injures women. He compares the Nephites unfavorably with the Lamanites.\nJacob's prophetic knowledge and the allegory of the olive tree.\nJacob expounds on the purpose of the plates and his knowledge of Christ and the resurrection, and how the Jews will reject Christ. Then he tells the allegory of the olive tree, citing it from Zenos, an extra-Biblical prophet quoted by multiple writers in the Book of Mormon. The story describes the Gathering of Israel in the last days, where the house of Israel is a tame olive tree whose branches partially die. Throughout the allegory, the master of the vineyard tries to revive the olive tree by grafting in wild branches in order to preserve its fruit. For a time this plan succeeds, but the wild branches get into the tree's roots and the fruit becomes bad. Both wild and tame branches are grafted onto the tree, which saves it and its fruit. In a final harvest, the vineyard will be burned. After recounting the allegory, Jacob promises that it is true and calls his readers to repentance.\nAnti-Christ Sherem, Nephite militarization, and Jacob's farewell.\nThe final section in the book tells the story of an antichrist named Sherem, who preaches that there will be no Christ, tells Jacob that no one can know the future, and asks him for a sign. Jacob prays, and God smites Sherem, who later confesses that he was lying about Christ and then dies. Subsequently the Nephites become righteous again and attempt to convert the Lamanites to their religion. According to Jacob, the Lamanites hated the Nephites and liked killing them, and the Nephites learned how to defend themselves. When Jacob finishes writing on the plates, he bequeaths them to his son Enos.\nInterpretation and themes.\nNephite organization.\nJacob's narrative shows that Nephi's duties were divided as he passed them on. A man whose identity is not specified was named king and took up the name Nephi and Nephi's brothers, Jacob and Joseph, were consecrated as priests. Jacob was assigned the task of recording on the small plates. Jacob shares that they kept the Law of Moses and looked forward to Christ's coming. He also writes that they quickly gained prosperity.\nEquality and kinship.\nIn her chapter on kinship in the Book of Mormon published in Oxford press's \"Americanist Approaches\", Nancy Bentley, a professor of English at the University of Pennsylvania specializing in kinship in 19th-century America, analyzes Jacob's speech. Jacob writes that God forbids polygamy to the Nephites in order to prioritize family harmony over multiple wives. While this was part of a larger argument the Book of Mormon makes in favor of valuing kinship relationships over contractual ones, it also made God the arbiter of moral family relationships. Jacob also argues that the difference in skin color between Nephites and Lamanites is not a biological property, but an external marker of whether or not individuals follow the \"family-based spirituality\" of the Nephites.\nTo explain the need for his temple discourse, Jacob cites an issue with pride and inequality among the Nephites. He teaches them that to become like God, they must work towards divine principles such as equality, additionally suggesting the need to rid themselves of inaccurate views of themselves and others. To overcome negative human tendency, the people must turn to God. Christian theology professor Deidre Nicole Green theorizes on Jacob's emphasis to treat everyone as your neighbor, that it is vital to think of all others as equal in order to have charity towards them. Green proposes, \"Charity is not just tolerance.\"\nSexual fidelity.\nJacob, says Green, preaches on different points of pride for the Nephites since they claim superiority over the Lamanites. One of these issues he points out is that the Lamanite women appear to be more respected than Nephite women, also suggesting that Lamanite families are more righteous in their love for each other. While the Nephites have begun to follow David and Solomon's examples of having multiple women, according to Jacob, this practice has \"broken the hearts\" of their wives and lost them the confidence of their children. He insists they should follow the Lamanite example of sexual fidelity and have only one wife and no concubines. Jacob's firm condemnation of the Nephites taking up plural marriage is surprising to some readers given polygamy practices of the Latter-day Saint movement during the 1800s.\nThe second chapter of Jacob, in verse thirty, contains what many believers during the 1800s saw as the allowance for polygamy. It says that God can command periods of plural marriage as an exception to his law. Journalist and religious studies scholar Jana Reiss writes that Latter-day Saints believe the 1830s are an example of such a period, which ended in 1904 when the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced any members practicing polygamy would be excommunicated. Some churches which are part of the Latter-day Saint movement still take part in this practice.\nSherem.\nRiess contrasts Sherem with biblical instances of Ish Elohim, different anonymous \"men of God\" who appear to a leader and inform them of a needed change. The story often involves a sign of the Ish Elohim's prophetic status and revolves around God's punishment to those who take part in false worship. Sherem, according to Riess, is an \"upholder of the law\" and reproaches Jacob for leaving behind the established religion by preaching of a Christ. Despite this alignment with the \"man of God\" outline, Jacob includes more information about Sherem than is typically included in the anonymous Ish Elohim stories. Additionally, rather than revealing a sign of his prophetic calling, Sherem demands a sign and Jacob demonstrates his own calling.\nRiess also compares Sherem's story to Ren\u00e9 Girard's scapegoat theory. The Nephites, she writes, were upset over some of Jacob's teachings regarding their sins. Just as two brothers fighting over a toy unite again after insulting a common enemy, Sherem's story may have been vital to bring the Nephites onto common ground.\nComparative religion researcher Jacob Rennaker identifies that Sherem's smiting is never directly attributed to God in the text. The description that he was suffering for \"many days\" before dying may suggest inner turmoil and \"self-inflicted madness\".\nSignificant textual variants.\nThe book was titled \"Book of Jacob: Brother of Nephi\" in the first edition of the Book of Mormon.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It describes the Jaredites, descendants of Jared and his companions, who were led by God to the Americas shortly after the confusion of tongues and the destruction of the Tower of Babel. Ether consists of fifteen chapters.\nThe title refers to Ether, a Jaredite prophet who, according to the Book of Mormon, lived at the end of the period covered by the book, believed to be circa 2600 or 2100\u00a0BC through 600\u00a0BC or later, at least 1500 but possibly as long as 2500 years.\nNarrative.\nJared and his people were among the many scattered peoples from the destruction of the Tower of Babel. The brother of Jared is described as \"a large and mighty man ... highly favored of the Lord\", and seems to have been the spiritual leader of the group. He was given a vision of the history of the world, and inscribed prophecies, which were \"sealed up\" until the Lord decides to reveal them. The Lord told the brother of Jared to build unpowered submarines, termed \"barges\" or \"vessels\", to cross the ocean to the promised land. The barges could circulate fresh air because of openings in the top and bottom of the vessel. The hole in the top could be \"stopped up\" when the waves crashed over the vessel to prevent scuttling. The hole in the bottom is assumed to have been constructed as a sort of moon pool with the lip above the waterline so it would not flood the vessel. This would also allow wave action and the buoying of the vessel to pump fresh air in and out of the vessel when the upper opening was uncapped.\nBecause the vessels could not sustain fire or windows for light, the brother of Jared went to a mountain and prayed for help. God touched several molten stones and made them shine. Because of the brother of Jared's great faith, he saw the finger of God. He then saw and spoke with Jehovah. The people launched the vessels and traveled through great storms. After 344 days, they arrived at the Americas. Jared and his brother led the people to successfully establish a righteous nation.\nProvenance.\nAs the story is told in the Book of Mormon, what later was named the Book of Ether was taken from a set of twenty-four plates written by Ether and discovered by the people of Limhi during the time of King Mosiah (son of King Benjamin). Joseph Smith claimed the book was abridged by Moroni onto the golden plates, which Joseph Smith claimed to translate into English.\nHowever, according to Daniel H.

Tartu has a population of 97,759 (as of 2024). It is southeast of Tallinn and 245 kilometres (152 miles) northeast of Riga, Latvia. Tartu lies on the Emaj\u00f5gi river, which connects the two largest lakes in Estonia, Lake V\u00f5rtsj\u00e4rv and Lake Peipus. From the 13th century until the end of the 19th century, Tartu was known in most of the world by variants of its historical name Dorpat.\nTartu, the largest urban centre of southern Estonia, is home to the nation's oldest and most renowned university, the University of Tartu (founded in 1632). Tartu also houses the Supreme Court of Estonia, the Ministry of Education and Research, the Estonian National Museum, and the oldest Estonian-language theatre, Vanemuine. It is also the birthplace of the Estonian Song Festivals.\nTartu was designated as the European Capital of Culture in 2024.\nNames and etymology.\nIt is thought that the name derives from the word for aurochs, \"tarvas\". Since Estonia became an independent country in 1918, the Estonian-language \"Tartu\" (), alternative South Estonian spelling: \"Tarto\") has been the only name in official use but throughout its history there have also been various names for it in other languages. Most of them derive ultimately from the earliest attested form, the Estonian \"Tarbatu\". In German, Swedish and Polish the town has been known, and up until the 20th century was sometimes referred to, as , a variant of \"Tarbatu\". In Russian the city has been known as (\"Yur\u2032yev\", after Yuri, the baptismal name of grand prince Yaroslav I the Wise) and as (\"Derpt\", from the Low German variant of \"Dorpat\"). Similarly the city has been known as \"T\u0113rbata\" in Latvian, and Finnish speakers use the toponym \"Tartto\".\nTartu lies on the Emaj\u00f5gi River, whose name literally means 'mother river' in Estonian. In Latvian, the name of Emaj\u00f5gi river is M\u0113tra. Therefore, Tartu's historical unofficial name in Latvian is M\u0113traine. Historically, Tartu was the main center for Latvian academic education, which is the reason why the name of the city used to be Latvianized.\nHistory.\nBeginnings.\nArchaeological evidence of the first permanent settlement on the site of modern Tartu dates to as early as the 5th century AD. By the 7th century, local inhabitants had built a wooden fortification on the east side of Toome Hill (\"Toomem\u00e4gi\"). Over the next centuries the settlement grew, and around 9th\u201310th centuries became an inland trading center.\nThe first documented records of the area were made by later mediaeval chroniclers who described the events of early-11th-century Kievan Rus'. According to the \"Primary Chronicle\" (PVL) and \"Sofia First Chronicle\" (SPL), Yaroslav the Wise, Grand Prince of Kiev, invaded the region of Tartu in c. 1030, and after defeating the \"Chud'\", built his own fort there, and named it \"Yuryev\". Tartu may have remained under Kievan Rus' control until 1061, when, according to the SPL, the \"Yuryev\" fort was burned down by \"Sosols\" (probably Oeselians, Sackalians, or another Estonian tribe). Soon afterwards the fort was rebuilt by locals. In the 12th century, local Ungannians on one side and troops from the neighbouring Novgorod Republic on the other side repeatedly raided each other. In those campaigns, the invaders were reportedly able to capture Tartu in 1133 or 1134, and in the winter of 1191\u20131192, however these temporary captures are not known to have brought any lasting territorial changes.\nMedieval bishopric.\nDuring the period of Northern Crusades in the beginning of the 13th century the fort of \"Tarbatu\" (or \"Tharbata\") was captured by the crusading Teutonic knights \u2014 also known as the Brothers of the Sword \u2014 and recaptured by Estonians on several occasions. In 1224, after the princes of Novgorod and Pskov had sent additional troops led by prince Vyachko of Kukenois to aid the Estonian defenders of the fort, it was besieged and conquered for one last time by the Teutonic crusaders. Subsequently, known as Dorpat (Latin: \"Tarbatum\"), Tartu became a commercial centre of considerable importance during the later Middle Ages and the capital of the semi-independent Bishopric of Dorpat.\nIn 1262 the army of prince Dmitri of Pereslavl launched an assault on Dorpat, capturing and destroying the town. His troops did not manage to capture the bishop's fortress on Toome Hill. The event was recorded both in subsequent German and Old East Slavic chronicles, which also provided the first record of a settlement of German merchants and artisans which had arisen alongside the bishop's fortress.\nIn medieval times, after the Livonian Order was subsumed into the Teutonic Knights in 1236, the town became an important trading city. In the 1280s Dorpat joined the Hanseatic League. \nPolish-Lithuanian and Swedish rule.\nIn 1558, Tsar Ivan the Terrible of Russia invaded Tartu beginning the Livonian War. Forces under the command of Pyotr Shuiski encircled the town and began the heavy bombardment. In light of this and without any prospect of external help the town surrendered. The local bishop was imprisoned in Moscow, which effectively ended the period of local self-government. After the Truce of Jam Zapolski of 1582, Tartu and surrounding areas became part of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1598, it became the capital of the Dorpat Voivodeship of the Duchy of Livonia. A grammar school (\"Gymnasium Dorpatense\") was established in Tartu in 1583 by the Polish Jesuits. In addition, a translators' seminary was organized in Tartu and the city received its red and white flag from the Polish king Stephen B\u00e1thory.\nThe activities of both the grammar school and the seminary were stopped by the Polish\u2013Swedish War. Already in late 1600 the forces of Charles IX of Sweden besieged the city defended by three banners of reiters and the city's burghers. Despite repeated assaults, the Swedes could not enter the city. Finally in 1601 Capt. Hermann Wrangel switched sides, assaulted the castellan and opened the gates for the Swedish forces. The town was retaken by Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth on 13 April 1603 following a brief siege led by hetman Jan Karol Chodkiewicz; roughly 1000 Swedish soldiers surrendered and were escorted to Tallinn.\nAfter another Polish-Swedish War, in 1625 Tartu was once again captured by Sweden. In the effect of the 1629 Truce of Altmark the city became part of the Dominions of Sweden, which led to the foundation of the University of Tartu in 1632 by king Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden.\nImperial Russia.\nIn 1704, the town was taken by the army commanded by Tsar Peter I of Russia. As a result, around a quarter of the town and much of the fortifications were damaged. In 1708, the remainder of the fortifications and houses, including the remains of bishops castle, were blown up, all movable property was looted and all citizens were deported to Russia. With the Treaty of Nystad in 1721, the city became part of the Russian Empire and was known as \"Derpt\". Fires in the 18th century destroyed much of the medieval architecture, the Great Fire of Tartu in 1775 removed most of the buildings in the centre. The city was rebuilt along Late Baroque and Neoclassical lines including the Tartu Town Hall which was built between 1782 and 1789. In 1783 the city became the centre of Derpt uyezd within the Governorate of Livonia.\nDuring the second half of the 19th century, Tartu was the cultural centre for Estonians in the era of Romantic nationalism. The city hosted Estonia's first song festival in 1869. \"Vanemuine\", the first national theatre, was established in 1870. Tartu was also the setting for the foundation of the Society of Estonian Literati in 1872.\nTartu railway station was opened in 1876 when Tapa\u2013Tartu route was built. The station building was opened in 1877. In the history of tuberculosis, in 1891 The Veterinary College at Dorpat produced seminal research using the Tuberculin test on 1,000 cattle.\nIn 1893, the city was officially retitled to the ancient Russian name \"Yuryev\". The university was subsequently russified from 1895 on with the introduction of compulsory Russian in teaching. Much of the university property was relocated to Voronezh in 1918 and during the German occupation, the university worked under the name Landesuniversit\u00e4t Dorpat. During the Estonian War of Independence the university of Tartu was re-opened as an Estonian language university on 1 December 1919.\nIndependent Estonia (1918\u20131940).\nWith Estonian independence after World War I, the city officially became known by the Estonian name \"Tartu\". At the end of the 1918\u20131920 Estonian War of Independence following World War I, a peace treaty between the Bolshevik Russia and Estonia was signed on 2 February 1920 in Tartu (Treaty of Tartu). With the treaty, Soviet Russia renounced territorial claims to Estonia \"for all time\".\nIn 1920, the peace treaty between Soviet Russia and Finland was also signed in Tartu.\nDuring the interwar period T\u00e4htvere neighbourhood was built, former Raadi Manor buildings started to house Estonian National Museum (destroyed during Tartu Offensive in 1944) and art school Pallas was opened.\nGerman and Soviet occupations (1940\u20131991).\nDuring World War II, the Stalinist Soviet Union invaded and occupied Estonia and Tartu in June 1940. Large parts of the city as well as the historical \"Kivisild\" (\"Stone bridge\", built in 1776\u20131778) over the Emaj\u00f5gi river were destroyed by the retreating Soviet Army, partly in 1941 and almost completely in 1944 by the then retreating German Army. Already heavily damaged, Tartu was repeatedly bombed by the Soviet air forces on 27 January 1943, on 26 February 1944, on 7\u20138 March 1944, and on 25\u201326 March 1944. After the war ended, much of the city's historic centre was left in ruins. Even the less damaged buildings in entire city blocks were demolished by the Soviet occupation authorities and large swathes of previously residential areas were turned into parks and parking lots.\nAfter the war, the Soviet authorities declared Tartu a \"closed town for foreigners\", as an airbase for bombers was constructed on Raadi Airfield, in the northeast outskirts of the city. It was one of the largest military airbases in the former Eastern Bloc and housed strategic bombers carrying nuclear bombs. On one end of an older strip of the runway, the new building of Estonian National Museum was built.\nTartu Airport was opened in the south of the city in 1946. Besides the airport Estonian Aviation Academy was established in 1993. Privately owned Estonian Aviation Museum, which is 5\u00a0km to the East of the airport (7\u00a0km by car), was opened to the public in 2002.\nDuring the 1944\u20131991 Soviet occupation the population of Tartu almost doubled from 57,000 to above 100,000 \u2014 due to mass immigration from Russia and other areas of the former Soviet Union, in large part because of the military airbase. \nModern era.\nSince Estonia regained its independence in 1991, the old town centre has been renovated. Notably, St. John's Church, in ruins since World War II, has been restored. Many new commercial and business buildings have been erected (\"Tartu Kaubamaja\", \"Tasku\", \"Emaj\u00f5e kaubanduskeskus\", \"L\u00f5unakeskus\", \"Kvartal\", etc.). The highest residential building and local landmark \"Tigutorn\" was opened in 2008.\nThe AHHAA science centre relocated to a new building in 2011 and the Estonian National Museum's new main building opened in 2016.\nGeography.\nClimate.\nTartu lies within the temperate humid continental climate zone (Dfb). The climate is rather mild considering the high latitude, largely due to the proximity of the Baltic Sea and warm airflows from the Atlantic. Nevertheless, continental influence can be felt on hot summer days and cold spells in winter, when the temperature can occasionally (but rarely) drop below . Generally, summers are warm and winters are cold.\nThe Tartu weather station is located in T\u00f5ravere village, which is about 20 kilometers from the city, so the actual temperature in the city may be slightly warmer than the official average temperatures.\nEconomy.\nMostly known as a university town, Tartu is also a site of heavy industry. The food industry has traditionally been important for the town's economy and some bigger companies in the field include A. Le Coq, Tartu Mill and Salvest. Kroonpress is one of the leading printing press companies in the Baltics.\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, many ICT enterprises and other high-tech companies have taken a foothold in Tartu. Notable examples include Playtech Estonia, Nortal (formerly Webmedia Group), ZeroTurnaround, Tarkon, Reach-U and Raintree Estonia. Skype has an office in Tartu. The university is one of the largest employers, which explains the large proportion of highly skilled professionals \u2013 researchers, professors, doctors, and Tartu University Clinic has been considered the largest employer of Tartu.\nTransport.\nThe city is served by Tartu Airport. The distance to Estonia's \"summer holiday capital\", P\u00e4rnu (in the western Estonia) is and the fastest route there by road is through Viljandi and Kilingi-N\u00f5mme. Tartu is connected to Riga in Latvia as well as Tallinn and other Estonian towns by many bus and train routes.\nDemographics.\nTartu's historic population is presented in the following table, based on data from official censuses since 1881 and Estonian Statistical Office. Note that the data up to 2011 is not directly comparable to the most recent numbers, as the methodology of compiling population statistics has changed.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNeighbourhoods.\nTartu is officially divided into 17 neighbourhoods, which carry no administrative purposes. Their names and borders are defined.\nKesklinn\nAnnelinn\nKarlova\nIhaste\nRopka&lt;br&gt;t\u00f6\u00f6stusrajoon\nJaamam\u00f5isa\nRaadi-&lt;br&gt;Kruusam\u00e4e\n\u00dclej\u00f5e\nT\u00e4htvere\nRopka\nVeeriku\nTammelinn\nR\u00e4nilinn\nMaarja-&lt;br&gt;M\u00f5isa\nEducation and culture.\nTartu is often considered the \"intellectual capital city\" of the country, especially as it is home to the nation's oldest and most renowned university, the University of Tartu (founded in 1632). The university, formerly known as the University of Dorpat; ), was founded by King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden in 1632. Mainly for this reason, Tartu is also \u2013 tongue-in-cheek \u2013 known as \"Athens of the Emaj\u00f5gi\" or as \"Heidelberg of the North\".\nTartu is also the seat of the Estonian University of Life Sciences, the Baltic Defence College, Estonian Aviation Academy (formerly known as Tartu Aviation College), and the Estonian Ministry of Education and Research. Other notable institutions include the Supreme Court of Estonia (re-established in Tartu in autumn 1993), the Estonian Historical Archives, Estonian National Museum, Estonian Sports and Olympic Museum as well as the oldest and renowned theatre in the country, Vanemuine, where they have a well-respected ballet company as well as theatre, opera and musical productions.\nThe city is also home to Tartu school of composition.\nMost of the sculptures in Tartu are dedicated to historical figures. Among them, the most famous are the Barclay de Tolly monument on Barclay Square in downtown, the Kissing Students monument on the town hall square and Gustav II Adolf\u00b4s monument on King's Square ().\nScience.\nScholars hailing from Tartu include the pioneer of embryology Karl Ernst von Baer, a pioneer of animal behaviour studies Jakob von Uexk\u00fcll, and a cultural theorist and semiotician Juri Lotman. Johann Friedrich von Eschscholtz, a Baltic German physician, naturalist, and entomologist, was born in Tartu. He was one of the earliest scientific explorers of the Pacific region, making significant collections of flora and fauna in Alaska, California, and Hawaii. Nobel Chemistry Prize laureate Wilhelm Ostwald studied and worked in Tartu. The Tartu School is one of the leading scientific schools in semiotics.\nMain sights.\nThe architecture and city planning of historical Tartu mainly go back to the pre-independence period, with Germans forming the upper and middle classes of society, and therefore contributing many architects, professors and local politicians.\nMost notable are the old Lutheran St. John's Church (, ), the 18th-century town hall, the university building, ruins of the 13th-century cathedral, the botanical gardens, the main shopping street, many buildings around the town hall square and Barclay Square.\nParts of the medieval city wall are preserved in Lai Street and Vabaduse Street.\nThe historical slum area called Supilinn (\"Soup Town\") is located on the bank of river Emaj\u00f5gi, near the town centre and is regarded as one of the few surviving \"poor\" neighbourhoods of 19th-century Europe. At the moment Supilinn is being rapidly renovated, undergoing a slow transformation from the historic slum into a prestigious high-class neighborhood. The active community embodied by the Supilinn Society is committed to preserving the heritage.\nThe Second World War destroyed large parts of the city centre and during the Soviet occupation, many new buildings were erected \u2013 notably the new Vanemuine Theater. The effects of the war are still witnessed by the relative abundance of parks and greenery in the historic centre. Typical Soviet-style neighbourhoods of blocks of high-rise flats were built between World War II and the restoration of Estonian independence in 1991, the largest such district being Annelinn.\nPresently, Tartu is also known for several modern buildings of the \"steel, concrete and glass\" variation, but has managed to retain a mix of old and new buildings in the centre of town. Notable examples include the Tigutorn Tower and the Emaj\u00f5e Centre, both built during the current period of independence; Tartu's tallest and second tallest towers, respectively. Tartu's large student population means that it has a comparatively thriving nightlife, with many nightclubs, bars, and restaurants, including the world's highest-ceiling pub, in the historic Gunpowder Cellar of Tartu.\nAnnually, in the summer, Tartu hosts the Hanseatic Days festival () to celebrate its Hanseatic heritage. The festival includes events such as handicraft markets, historic workshops and jousting tournaments.\nSports.\nThe city hosts the Rally Estonia. It is the biggest motorsport event in the Baltic states. The rally was part of the European Rally Championship between 2014 and 2016. Since 2020 Rally Estonia is part of the World Rally Championship.\nTartu is the home for basketball club Tartu \u00dclikool/Rock, which participates in the Korvpalli Meistriliiga and the Latvian-Estonian Basketball League.\nFootball club JK Tammeka Tartu, one of the Meistriliiga clubs, is located in Tartu. Their home stadium is the Tamme Staadion, which has a capacity of 1600. The city is also home to the Tartu JK Welco and FC Santos Tartu clubs, which play in the Esiliiga, the second division.\nTartu has a professional volleyball club, Bigbank Tartu, as well as the handball team, the Tartu \u00dclikool/Glassdrive, which plays in the second division of Estonian handball.\nTartu is also the hometown of Clement \"Puppey\" Ivanov, captain of Team Secret, a professional Dota 2 team. He won the first International, and was runner-up two years in a row with Natus Vincere.\nThe 2017 World Orienteering Championships were held in Tartu.\nThe annual running event Tartu S\u00fcgisjooks takes place in Tartu.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nTartu is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; travel guide from Wikivoyage"}
{"id": "31628", "revid": "48048524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31628", "title": "The Chemical Brothers", "text": "British electronic music duo\nThe Chemical Brothers are an English electronic music duo formed by Ed Simons and Tom Rowlands in Manchester in 1992. They were pioneers in bringing the big beat genre to the forefront of pop culture.\nOriginally known as The Dust Brothers, they changed their name due to the existence of another band with the same name. Their first album \"Exit Planet Dust\" sold over one million copies and debuted at No. 9 on the UK Albums Chart. After attracting Virgin Records, the duo achieved further success with their second album \"Dig Your Own Hole\" (1997), which topped the UK chart. They have had six No. 1 albums and 13 top-20 singles in the UK, including two chart-toppers. They have won six Grammy Awards, including Best Rock Instrumental Performance, Best Dance Recording, and Best Dance/Electronic Album.\nHistory.\n1984\u20131995: Formation and early incarnations.\nEd Simons (born 9 June 1970) was born the son of a barrister mother and a father he described as \"absent\". After finishing at Dulwich College, an \"expensive\" public school with 11 O levels and three A levels, he studied history, at the University of Manchester.\nTom Rowlands (born 11 January 1971) was raised in Henley-on-Thames having attended Reading Blue Coat School in Sonning-On-Thames. He met Simons at the University of Manchester in 1989; they shared an interest in raves and club-going. Rowlands chose Manchester primarily to immerse himself in its music scene, particularly the Fac 51 Hacienda.\nRowlands was in a band called Ariel prior to meeting Simons. He formed Ariel in London with friends Brendan Melck and Mathew Berry. Their first single was \"Sea of Beats\", which was essentially a white label record. Before Philip Brown set up Echo Logik Records, their first promo was \"Bokadilo\". Other songs, released on 12-inch, included \"Mustn't Grumble\" and their best-known, \"Rollercoaster\". After a year on Echo Logik they signed to the record label deConstruction. They insisted on a female singer and they recruited former Xpansions frontwoman Sally Ann Marsh, and after some disappointing songs such as \"Let It Slide\" (Rowlands would later describe it as \"a stinker\"), the band fell apart. One of the last things Ariel did was the song \"T Baby\", which was remixed by the pair.\nRowlands and Simons started to DJ in 1992 at a club called Naked Under Leather, located in the back of a pub called the Swinging Sporran (later renamed Retro Bar and currently operated by the University of Manchester). There, they were known by the alias \"237 Turbo Nutters\", after the number of their house on Dickenson Road in Manchester and a reference to their Blackburn raving days. The pair would play hip hop, techno, and house. The two called themselves The Dust Brothers after the US production duo, famous for their work with the Beastie Boys. After a while, Rowlands and Simons began to run out of suitable instrumental hip hop tracks to use, so they started to make their own. Using a Hitachi hi-fi system, an Atari ST, a sampler, and a keyboard, they recorded \"Song to the Siren\", which sampled This Mortal Coil. \"Song to the Siren\" was released on their own record label, which they called Diamond Records (after Ed's nickname). At this point the Dust Brothers were the first-ever backroom DJs in the Sumptuous Locarno Lounge at The Job Club in Gossips night club in Dean Street, Soho from April 1992 till April 1993.\nIn October 1992, they pressed 500 white label copies and took them to dance-record shops around London, but all refused to play it, saying it was too slow (the track played at 111 BPM). They sent a copy to London DJ Andrew Weatherall, who made it a permanent fixture in his DJ sets. In May 1993 Steven Hall signed the duo and Junior Boy's Own released \"Song to the Siren\".\nAround June 1993, the Dust Brothers recorded their first remixes. The first was \"Packet of Peace\" for Justin Robertson's Lionrock group, followed by songs from Leftfield, Republica, and the Sandals. Later in 1993, Rowlands and Simons completed work on their \"Fourteenth Century Sky\" EP, released in January 1994. It contained the groundbreaking \"Chemical Beats\", which epitomised the duo's genre-defining big beat sound. The EP also contained \"One Too Many Mornings\", which for the first time showed their less intense, more chilled-out side. Both \"One Too Many Mornings\" and \"Chemical Beats\" would later appear on their debut album. \"Fourteenth Century Sky\" was followed later in 1994 by the \"My Mercury Mouth EP\". \"Chemical Beats\" was also part of the soundtrack for the first edition of the \"Wipeout\" video game series, having been featured in \"Wipeout\" for the PlayStation in 1995.\nIn October 1994, the Dust Brothers became resident DJs at the small but influential Heavenly Sunday Social Club at the Albany pub in London's Great Portland Street. Noel Gallagher, Paul Weller, James Dean Bradfield, and Tim Burgess were regular visitors. The Dust Brothers were subsequently asked to remix tracks by Manic Street Preachers and the Charlatans, plus Primal Scream's \"Jailbird\" and the Prodigy's \"Voodoo People\". These two remixes received television exposure, being playlisted by MTV Europe's \"The Party Zone\" in 1995.\nIn March 1995, the Dust Brothers began their first international tour, which included the United States \u2013 where they played with Orbital and Underworld \u2013 then a series of European festivals. Also around this time, objections were filed by the original Dust Brothers over the use of their name, and so Rowlands and Simons had to decide on a new name. They decided to call themselves the Chemical Brothers after \"Chemical Beats\".\nIn June 1995, they released their fourth single, the first under their new identity. \"Leave Home\" was released on Junior Boy's Own, as a preview of the imminent debut album and became the band's first chart hit, peaking at No. 17.\n1995\u20131998: \"Exit Planet Dust\" and \"Dig Your Own Hole\".\nIn July 1995, the Chemical Brothers released their debut album \"Exit Planet Dust\" (the title inspired by their name change) on Junior Boy's Own. It debuted on the UK chart at No. 9, and featured guest vocalist Beth Orton on the song \"Alive Alone\". It eventually went on to sell over a million copies worldwide, and was used on the soundtrack of the science fiction TV series pilot \"Virtuality\". Shortly after its release, the Chemical Brothers signed to Virgin Records, to which they took their own offshoot label, Freestyle Dust. For their next single, \"Life Is Sweet\", released in September 1995, they again used a guest vocalist, featuring their friend Tim Burgess, singer of the Charlatans. It reached No. 25 in the UK singles chart. The single was also \"Select\" magazine's \"Single of the Month\" for October. The release included a Daft Punk remix of \"Life Is Sweet\".\nIn October 1995, the duo returned to the Heavenly Sunday Social for a second and final run of DJ dates. They then became residents of Heavenly Social on Saturdays at Turnmills and also in Liquid Rooms in Tokyo. In November, the Chemical Brothers played the Astoria Theatre in London. The duo also supported The Prodigy in December on dates at Brixton Academy and in Blackpool.\nIn January 1996, \"Exit Planet Dust\" was certified gold. The Chemical Brothers released their first new material in six months on Virgin, the \"Loops of Fury\" EP. The four-track release was limited to 20,000 copies, but is now available for digital download. It entered the UK chart at No. 13. \"NME\" described the lead track as \"splashing waves of synths across hard-hitting beats\". The EP also contained a Dave Clarke remix of \"Chemical Beats\", and two other new tracks, \"Get Up on It Like This\" and \"(The Best Part Of) Breaking Up\".\nIn February 1996, \"Select\" magazine published a list of the 100 best albums of the 1990s thus far. \"Exit Planet Dust\" was listed at Number 39. In August 1996, the Chemical Brothers supported Oasis at Knebworth, where 125,000 people attended each of the two shows.\nDuring the 1995 Glastonbury Festival, Noel Gallagher had told them how much he liked \"Exit Planet Dust\", and asked if he could sing on a future track, similar to the way Tim Burgess had worked on \"Life Is Sweet\". They did not think much of the offer at the time, given how busy Gallagher would be with the release of Oasis' \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\", plus the complexities of dealing with each other's record companies. However, the duo later worked on a track they thought would benefit from a vocal. They sent Gallagher a tape of what they had done so far. He worked on it overnight, and left a message early next morning that he was ready to record it. The track was called \"Setting Sun\" and was finally released in October 1996. It entered the UK chart at the top, giving the duo their first ever No. 1 single. \"Setting Sun\" was backed by a longer instrumental version, and also a new track \"Buzz Tracks\", which was not much more than a DJ tool. The three remaining members of the Beatles' lawyers later wrote to the Chemical Brothers, mistakenly claiming they had sampled \"Tomorrow Never Knows\". Virgin Records hired a musicologist to prove they did not sample the song.\nIn 1996, \"Live at the Social Volume 1\" was released by Heavenly Records, which became the Chemical Brothers' first mix CD (excluding \"Xmas Dust Up\", a free album that came in a 1994 issue of \"NME\"). It was also the duo's first live album (excluding the EP \"Live 05\").\nIn March 1997, the Chemical Brothers released the second track from their forthcoming album. \"Block Rockin' Beats\" contained a Schoolly D vocal sample and re-working of the bass-line from 23 Skidoo's single \"Coup\". The \"NME\" named it \"Single of the Week\" and said: \"It throbs like your head might if you had just done a length underwater in a swimming pool full of amyl.\" It later won them a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.\nIn the US at this time, \"Setting Sun\" was sitting at Number 80 in the Billboard Hot 100, after selling around 80,000 copies. Sales from \"Exit Planet Dust\" were also around 150,000.\nOn 7 April 1997, the Chemical Brothers released their second album, \"Dig Your Own Hole\". It was recorded at the band's own south London studio, with the title taken from graffiti on the wall outside. The album was well received, with \"Mixmag\" rating it 10/10 and calling it \"mad enough to be thrilling, slick enough for not even remotely trendy coffee tables\".\nDuring the summer of 1997, the Chemical Brothers toured extensively, particularly in the United States. In August, the Chemical Brothers achieved a rapprochement with the US Dust Brothers, and asked them to remix the forthcoming single \"Elektrobank\". They themselves also became highly sought after for remixes for other artists. In September, the next single from \"Dig Your Own Hole\", \"Elektrobank\" was released. In November, the pair played at Dublin's Point Theatre, with support from Carl Cox. They also began a US tour in Detroit.\nAt the end of the year, \"Dig Your Own Hole\"'s final track, the nine-minute-long \"The Private Psychedelic Reel\", gave rise to a limited-edition mini-EP of the same name. The B-side consisted of a live version of \"Setting Sun\", recorded at the Lowlands Festival, Netherlands on 24 August 1997. Also in December, following four sold-out US shows, the Chemical Brothers toured the UK, concluding in a sold-out show at Brixton Academy, London.\nIn 1998, they concentrated more on DJing, although some remixes did see the light of day, including \"I Think I'm in Love\" from Spiritualized. Both a vocal remix and an instrumental remix were included in the single release. Each clocked in at over seven-and-a-half minutes. Another remix completed by the Chemical Brothers was \"Delta Sun Bottleneck Stomp\" by Mercury Rev. This was another extension in the association between the two bands, since Mercury Rev's Jonathon Donahue contributed to \"The Private Psychedelic Reel\" on \"Dig Your Own Hole\".\nIn September 1998, a second mix album, \"Brothers Gonna Work It Out\", was released. It contains some of their own tracks and remixes, as well as songs from artists who have influenced their sound, such as Renegade Soundwave, Meat Beat Manifesto, Carlos \"After Dark\" Berrios, and Kenny 'Dope' Gonzales.\n1999\u20132002: \"Surrender\" and \"Come with Us\".\nIn May 1999, the Chemical Brothers played three UK dates, their first since December 1997. Also that month, they released their first new original material in two years, a track called \"Hey Boy Hey Girl\". This was more house-influenced than big beat. In interviews at the time, Rowlands and Simons indicated that the track was inspired by nights out at Sheffield club Gatecrasher. The track was also one of their more commercially accessible tracks and went to number 3 in the UK chart.\nTheir third album, \"Surrender\", was released in June 1999. It featured vocals from Noel Gallagher, Mercury Rev's Jonathan Donahue, and Mazzy Star's Hope Sandoval. As \"Hey Boy Hey Girl\" had suggested, the album was more house-oriented than the previous two. On one of the album's stand out tracks, \"Out of Control\", New Order's Bernard Sumner supported by Primal Scream's Bobby Gillespie provided vocals. It reached No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart. The Michel Gondry-directed music video for \"Let Forever Be\", which utilised ground-breaking video and film effects in its depiction of a young woman's nightmares, also received a lot of attention.\nLater that summer, the Chemical Brothers performed at the Woodstock '99 concert on 24 July, with positive reception. They later headlined the Glastonbury dance tent on the Friday night, followed by a UK tour which ended in December and included Homelands Scotland on 4 September. In November, \"Out of Control\", featuring Sumner and Gillespie on vocals, was released as a single. The release also contained the Sasha remix. The final single from \"Surrender\", in February 2000, was the five track \"Music: Response\" EP, containing the title track and two remixes, plus Electronic Battle Weapon 4, named \"Freak of the Week\", and a track called \"Enjoyed\", which was essentially a remix of \"Out of Control\" by the Chemical Brothers themselves. A CD copy of \"Surrender\" was placed in the third \"Blue Peter\" time capsule, buried in January 2000. That same month, they appeared on Primal Scream's album \"Xtrmntr\" at track 11 with a remix.\nIn June 2000, they played the Pyramid stage at the Glastonbury Festival. In August 2000 they played to a large crowd at the main stage at Creamfields festival, Ireland. In December 2000, the Chemical Brothers aired one of their new tracks, \"It Began in Afrika\" at their New York DJ gigs, supporting U2.\nIn 2001, they were active with releases and live performances. Early in the year, they began working on a fourth album, provisionally titled \"Chemical Four\". The first track which fans got a taste of was \"It Began in Afrika\", as previously played in their DJ set in New York. The track would make its live debut in California in April 2001, at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. Another new track, \"Galaxy Bounce\", also got its public debut at Coachella. As had become customary for their releases and experiments, \"It Began in Afrika\" was first pressed as a promo, as part of the \"Electronic Battle Weapon\" series. It received much airplay on dance music radio shows in the UK, and became more and more popular in clubs over the course of the summer. It also became one of the \"anthems\" in Ibiza as the summer progressed. It was given a full commercial single release in September, reaching No. 8 in the UK singles chart, even though no promotional video was made for the track.\nRowlands and Simons also remixed a track from Fatboy Slim's \"Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars\", entitled \"Song for Shelter\". This remix was released as a single on 3 September 2001 (one week before \"It Began in Afrika\") as the CD2 single for \"Song for Shelter / Ya Mama\". It reached No. 30 in the UK singles chart (sales were combined with the CD1 single).\nThe Chemical Brothers finished work on another album, \"Come with Us\", in October 2001. It featured collaborations with Richard Ashcroft of the Verve (\"The Test\"), and long-time collaborator Beth Orton (\"The State We're In\"). The album was released in January 2002, preceded by a single, \"Star Guitar\", a melodic Balearic beat number, with a promotional video by Michel Gondry that featured passing scenery synchronised to the beat viewed through a train window. What would be the second track on the album, \"It Began in Afrika\", was released 10 September 2001 to be circulated around the clubbing scene where it was a popular hit. \"Star Guitar\" was also released as a DVD single, the pair's first. \"Come with Us\", was less well received than their previous albums, but nonetheless went straight to No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart in the first week of its release, selling 100,000 copies. In April, the title track from the album was released as a single with remixes by Fatboy Slim as part of a double A-sided release with \"The Test\".\nDuring the summer of 2002, the Chemical Brothers travelled the festival circuit to promote the album. Later in 2002, they released two EPs, one specifically aimed at Japan and the other the US (entitled \"AmericanEP\"). Both contained remixes, live versions and B-sides. Additionally, the band produced New Order's \"Here to Stay\", written for the film \"24 Hour Party People\" and released as a single to promote the soundtrack, and remixed the song as well. One of their other major songs from this album was \"Galaxy Bounce\", which was popular and featured as the main title music for the Xbox game \"Project Gotham Racing\". It was also included on the soundtrack for the movie \"\". \"Star Guitar\" was featured as a song on the PlayStation Portable's \"Lumines II\".\nTwo other songs, \"Come with Us (Introduction)\" and \"Star Guitar (Title Screen)\", were featured on a PlayStation 2 racing game titled \"WRC II: Extreme\". Both songs are instrumental. The song \"My Elastic Eye\" from the album \"Come with Us\" was played in the 2004 film \"The Butterfly Effect\" starring Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart.\n2003\u20132006: \"Push the Button\".\nEarly 2003 saw Rowlands and Simons back in the studio working on new material, including \"The Golden Path\", a collaboration with Wayne Coyne of the Flaming Lips. This was released in September 2003, at the same time as a \"best of\" album, entitled \"Singles 93\u201303\", marking ten years of the Chemical Brothers' releases. \"Singles 93\u201303\" included most, but not all, of their singles. A second new track, in addition to \"The Golden Path\", was included on the album, called \"Get Yourself High\". \"Singles 93\u201303\" was also released on DVD, with extra features including selected live performances and interviews with Rowlands, Simons, and many of their collaborators from throughout the period. \"Get Yourself High\", which featured Canadian rapper k-os on vocals, was released as a single in November 2003.\nIn late 2003 and 2004, the Chemical Brothers continued to work in the studio on new material and a remix of \"Slow\" by Kylie Minogue. After being released on rare white label vinyl, it was subsequently given a commercial release in March on CD (on her next single \"Red Blooded Woman\") and on 12-inch vinyl picture disc (containing two other Minogue remixes). In Summer 2004 they returned to the festival circuit, including appearances at the Glastonbury Festival, Tokyo, Scotland, and Ireland. They also visited South America for the second time (the first time being in 1999), arriving at Chile, Argentina, and Brazil. It was during these sets that they played new material, including \"Acid Children\", which proved to be one of the most popular new tracks.\nIn September 2004, the Chemical Brothers released the seventh \"Electronic Battle Weapon\". \"Electronic Battle Weapon 7\" was being released as a one-sided promo-only 12-inch, containing \"Acid Children\". A marked departure from the Chemical Brothers' previous musical endeavours, it featured a screeching 303 bassline and a distinctive vocal sample; a pitch-altered vocal sample proclaiming \"You Are All My Children Now!\", which is lifted from the horror film \"\". It was coupled with the projection of a sinister clown mouthing these same words at their live gigs.\nThe \"Electronic Battle Weapon\" series of promo releases have typically been newly recorded Chemical Brothers tracks, released on promo to allow DJs to test them in a club environment, and to gauge their popularity.\nIn 2004, the Chemical Brothers began work on \"Push the Button\", their fifth studio album, which features collaborations with Tim Burgess, Kele Okereke, and Anwar Superstar, amongst others. The album was released on 24 January 2005.\n\"Galvanize\", which features rapper Q-Tip on vocals, was the first single to be taken from \"Push the Button\", and premiered on iTunes. The single was released on 17 January 2005, and entered the UK chart at No. 3. The second single, \"Believe\" (featuring Kele Okereke from Bloc Party), failed to crack the top 10, but still made it into the top 20, peaking at No. 18. \"The Boxer\", featuring Tim Burgess, became the duo's first single to fail to crack the top 40.\nThe album and single \"Galvanize\" won a Grammy at the Grammy Awards of 2006. The track \"Surface to Air\" features a pulsing chord progression and bassline reminiscent of the intro to the Strokes song \"The Modern Age\".\nAn unofficial, remixed version of the album entitled \"Flip the Switch\" was released as a free download, along with the \"Believe\" EP, featuring six further remixes of \"Believe\".\nIn September 2006, the Chemical Brothers were revealed as the first musicians to be involved in Tate Tracks. Tate Modern invited various groups and songwriters to choose a work that inspired them from the gallery's collection of modern art and then write a track about it. The Chemical Brothers' submission, \"Rock Drill\", was inspired by the Jacob Epstein sculpture \"Torso in Metal from the Rock Drill\", and could be heard on headphones in front of the work in the gallery. From October 2006, it also became available to hear online at the Tate Tracks website.\n2007\u20132009: \"We Are the Night\".\nThe Brothers announced in June 2006 on their official web forum that the duo had been working on new material, specifically an album, code-named \"Chemical 6\". Simons also wrote that the band would be playing select venues in the Summer 2007 season, specifying Rome, and also Fabric in London. Simons was also quoted as saying that the duo were \"hoping to put a battle weapon out for the summer\", possibly referring to the Electronic Battle Weapon series, the somewhat experimental tracks the band occasionally released on white label record.\n\"Electronic Battle Weapon 8\" and \"9\" were debuted on Pete Tong's BBC Radio 1 show on 8 December 2006. The double-sided vinyl was finally released just before the Chemical Brothers' much anticipated New Year's Eve gig at the famous Turnmills in London. The vinyl had a limited edition release worldwide and was received well by fans, DJs, and critics alike. \"Electronic Battle Weapon 8\", at about six and a half minutes, was very distinct from the \"big acid\" style that the earlier \"Electronic Battle Weapons\" adhered to. It was characterised by 'thundering' drums with a rising synth line. A version of this track featured on the \"We Are the Night\" album and was entitled \"Saturate\". \"Electronic Battle Weapon 9\" was a typical Chemicals dancefloor track with their trademark vocoder vocals coupled with sirens and a basic 'tribal' melody.\nAt the same Turnmills gig, the Brothers also played a previously unreleased song at midnight to welcome 2007, which went down well with the crowd. This track eventually emerged as \"Burst Generator\", found on the forthcoming album \"We Are the Night\". Many were left wondering if the latest in the Electronic Battle Weapon series were simply one-off experiments or signalled a new direction they could take with the new album, perhaps swaying from their genre defining big beat albums of the past. The song was also the band's 100th released song.\nOn 21 March 2007, the Chemical Brothers officially announced their forthcoming album on Myspace. The new album, entitled \"We Are the Night\", was released on 2 July 2007 in the United Kingdom and 17 July 2007 in the United States. The Chemical Brothers cited a delay in the production of artwork for this delay. EMI subsequently released an online Chemical Brothers computer game as an apology. The track listing was released on the official mailing list on 10 April. Collaborations featured heavily on the album, including Klaxons (\"All Rights Reversed\"), Midlake (\"The Pills Won't Help You Now\"), Ali Love (\"Do It Again\"), and Willy Mason (\"Battle Scars\").\nOn 12 April 2007, \"Do It Again\" aired on Pete Tong's \"In New Music We Trust\" show on BBC Radio 1. The official release of the single was 4 June (digital download) and 14 June (12-inch, 7-inch and CD). The album went on general release in the UK on 2 July 2007.\nThe Chemical Brothers supplied a new track for the \"Heroes\" soundtrack, titled \"Keep My Composure\". An alternate version of this track was released on \"Brotherhood\", the duo's second singles compilation, which also featured the new single \"Midnight Madness\" and a second disc of every Electronic Battle Weapon released to date. The Chemical Brothers continued to tour into 2008 to promote the collection, including a landmark date at Olympia London.\n2010\u20132012: \"Further\", \"Hanna\" and \"Don't Think\".\nOn 30 March 2010, the band announced on their website that their seventh studio album, titled \"Further\", would be released on 22 June and would be \"the band's first to be released with corresponding films made specifically to match each of the 8 audio tracks.\" The films were made with long-time visuals collaborators Adam Smith and Marcus Lyall. Before the release of the album, the band played four shows in May at the London Roundhouse where they played the album and its accompanying films in their entirety. The films were released on a special edition DVD and on the iTunes LP edition.\nMost reviews were positive, with BBC Music declaring that \"...\u00a0synths are brutally manhandled and pushed to their limits across the eight tracks\". \"The Irish Times\" reported that \"This is a very impressive collection that is carried along with a stirring sense of velocity and momentum\". However, praise was not unanimous for the album, with the American rock magazine \"Spin\" giving it a rating of three out of five stars.\nAt the New York Comic Con, on 10 October 2010, film director Joe Wright announced that the Chemical Brothers would be scoring the soundtrack to his forthcoming film, \"Hanna\". Wright, who had worked with the Chemical Brothers in the past as a member of the visual company Vegetable Vision, stated that he was \"very excited to finally\u00a0... work with a more modern beat. There's a lot of bass, it's very loud.\" The soundtrack was released on iTunes on 15 March 2011 and on CD on 4 July 2011.\nThe duo also contributed a new version of the song \"Don't Think\" titled \"Nina Frequency\", as well as two new songs \"Electric Hands\" and \"Danka Jane\", to the soundtrack of the 2010 film \"Black Swan\" directed by Darren Aronofsky. All three songs have not been released.\nThe Chemical Brothers released their first concert film, \"Don't Think\", in 2012, documenting their performance at Fuji Rock Festival in Japan in 2011. The film debuted in February in theatres around the world, including a premiere in London where attendees\u00a0\u2013 including Matt Smith, Karen Gillan and Keira Knightley\u00a0\u2013 were seen dancing in aisles and seats, leading one reviewer to remark \"at times it was impossible to tell which 'hands in the air' were on screen and which were in the room.\" The film was the first concert film to be mixed in 7.1 surround sound, and was released on Blu-ray, DVD, and CD on 26 March 2012.\nOn 7 March 2012, it was announced that the Chemical Brothers would be scoring their second film soundtrack, for the bank heist film \"Now You See Me\", but the band had to pull out of the project in the early stages due to scheduling conflicts. In July 2012, the duo composed an official piece of music to soundtrack the cycling events at the 2012 Summer Olympics, titled 'Theme for Velodrome'.\n2012\u20132017: Rowlands' solo work and \"Born in the Echoes\".\nAfter \"Hanna\" and \"Don't Think\", Tom Rowlands worked on a number of solo projects. He remixed and produced music for Tinie Tempah, the Klaxons, I Break Horses, and New Order, scored the film \"Trespass Against Us\" starring Michael Fassbender and Brendan Gleeson and directed by longtime visual collaborator and film and television director Adam Smith, and the theatrical production of \"Life of Galileo\" directed by Joe Wright performed at the Young Vic, and released 12-inch single \"Through Me / Nothing but Pleasure\" on Erol Alkan's label Phantasy in May 2013.\nOn 21 October 2014, the Chemical Brothers released a single \", which was created for \", featuring Miguel and Lorde. In December 2014, they announced an appearance at the 2015 S\u00f3nar festival and a new album, scheduled for release in 2015.\nIn April 2015, videos containing animation and audio loops appeared on the official Chemical Brothers Facebook page and website, thechemicalbrothers.com, ahead of the imminent release of new music. On 23 April, their new song \"Sometimes I Feel so Deserted\" premiered on BBC Radio 1. On 17 July, the duo released \"Born in the Echoes\", their eighth album. Singles from this album included \"Go\"; an up-beat reunion with guest vocalist Q-Tip and director Michel Gondry and \"Wide Open\" in collaboration with Beck. St. Vincent, Ali Love, and Cate Le Bon also feature on the album.\nAlong with the new album announcement, it was revealed that Simons would \"take a break\" from touring to focus on unspecified academic work. Adam Smith filled in for him on stage during the 2015 tour. During the tour, Simons attended a few shows as an audience member, and both he and Rowlands expressed concern in interviews that this could mark a permanent retirement. The first concert without Simons was performed at Siemens Arena in Lithuania. Smith continued to fill in through the end of 2015, most notably at Glastonbury and the Apple Music Festival, and uniquely controlled both lights and music from the stage.\nSimons returned to live performances in 2016, performing at the Parklife Festival in Manchester, which included a new setlist and a cover of New Order's \"Temptation\" with Sumner's recorded vocals. In November 2016, the duo released the non-album single \"C-H-E-M-I-C-A-L\", which premiered on BBC Radio 1. The song originally debuted as a demo in 2012, created to open the duo's DJ sets from 2012 to 2015.\n2018\u20132021: \"No Geography\".\nOn 10 January 2018, the Chemical Brothers confirmed production of their ninth album, \"No Geography\", via Instagram and other social media platforms. They released their first song in three years on 28 September 2018, titled \"Free Yourself\", from the forthcoming album.\nOn 7 March 2019, Formula 1 announced a collaboration with the Chemical Brothers, which was released the next day in the form of the song \"We've Got To Try\".\nThe Chemical Brothers' ninth studio album, \"No Geography\", was released on 12 April 2019 to positive reviews. In 2020, the album won three Grammy Awards including Best Dance/Electronic Album, Best Dance Recording, and Best Music Video.\nIn 2019, \"We've Got to Try\" won the overall award and \"Best Director\" category at the Berlin Music Video Awards. The video for \"Eve of Destruction\", directed by Ollie Tong, took the 2nd place at the 2020 edition in the Best Art Director category.\n2021\u2013present: biography and \"For That Beautiful Feeling\".\nOn 22 April 2021, the Chemical Brothers released a then non-album single, \"The Darkness That You Fear\", with another song, \"Work Energy Principle\", being released as a B-side on 15 July.\nOn 17 March 2023, the Chemical Brothers released the second single, \"No Reason\". with the B-Side in form of \"All of a Sudden\" being released on 28 April alongside the Vinyl version of the single.\nOn 28 June, 2028, the Chemical Brothers released the third single, \"Live Again\" (featuring Halo Maud); they also announced that a biography, titled \"Paused in Cosmic Reflection\", would be coming out in late October.\nOn 21 August, 2023, the Chemical Brothers released the fourth single \"Skipping Like A Stone\", the second collaboration with Beck, after their 2015 single, \"Wide Open\".\nOn 5 September, 2023, the Chemical Brothers released the fifth, the titular single \"For That Beautiful Feeling\", alongside a short snipped of another album track \"Goodbye\", which was previously chosen by the community via the mailing list.\nOn September 8, 2023, their tenth album, \"For That Beautiful Feeling\", was released\nLive.\nThe Chemical Brothers have played at several major festivals, including Coachella, Glastonbury, Fuji Rock, Vive Latino, HFStival and the Reading and Leeds festivals. In addition to performing their own music, they also hold regular DJ nights where they mix other artists' tracks (in the style of \"Brothers Gonna Work It Out\").\nDiscography.\nStudio albums\nAwards and nominations.\nBerlin Music Video Awards\nThe Berlin Music Video Awards is an international festival that promotes the art of music videos\nBrit Awards\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Awards table/styles.css\" /&gt;\nChicago Film Critics Association\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Awards table/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGrammy Awards\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Awards table/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLos Angeles Film Critics Association\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Awards table/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMercury Prize\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Awards table/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMTV Europe Music Awards\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Awards table/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMTV Video Music Awards\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Awards table/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMTV Video Music Awards Japan\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Awards table/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMVPA Awards\nThe MVPA Awards are annually presented by a Los Angeles-based music trade organisation to honour the year's best music videos.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Awards table/styles.css\" /&gt;\nQ Awards\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Awards table/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUK Music Video Awards\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Awards table/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBerlin Music Video Awards\n\"For the Berlin music video award show, see\" Berlin Music Video Awards.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A dramatic account of the potential medical, economic, social, and environmental consequences of a nuclear war in Britain, it follows two families in Sheffield as a confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union erupts into war and a general nuclear exchange between NATO and the Warsaw Pact.\nAn international co-production between the BBC, Nine Network, and Western-World Television Inc., the film was shot on a budget of \u00a3400,000 (). It was the first of its kind to depict a nuclear winter and has been cited as the film \"which comes closest to representing the full horror of nuclear war and its aftermath, as well as the catastrophic impact that the event would have on human culture\". It has been compared to \"The War Game\" (1966) and \"The Day After\" (1983). It was nominated for seven BAFTA Awards in 1985 and won for Best Single Drama, Best Design, , and .\nPlot.\nIn the English city of Sheffield, young adults Ruth Beckett and Jimmy Kemp plan to marry after learning of Ruth's unplanned pregnancy. Meanwhile, an international crisis develops after the Soviet Union invades northern Iran in response to a United States-backed coup in the country. Daily life in Sheffield continues while an American ultimatum demanding joint withdrawal from Iran expires. After a limited nuclear exchange in Mashhad, armed conflict breaks out between America and the Soviet Union. As Britain prepares for the possibility of nuclear war, society gradually destabilises over the course of two days and violent suppression of anti-war protests takes place across the country. Inhabitants of Sheffield are spurred into panic buying and looting. Sheffield City Council officials take shelter in a makeshift bunker to command the area if central government should be destroyed. Ruth's family prepare to use their cellar as a shelter, while Jimmy's family construct a lean-to from mattresses and doors.\nJimmy is arguing with panic-buyers at the joinery with his friend Bob when civil defence sirens sound. Taking cover under a lorry, they see a mushroom cloud in the distance; a nuclear attack on a nearby airbase causes mass destruction to Sheffield, while attacks on other NATO targets across Britain kill and injure tens of millions of people. Jimmy attempts to reach Ruth, but is never seen again. His brother Michael is killed in the initial firestorm when their finch aviary collapses, while his mother suffers severe burns and his father falls ill from radiation poisoning in the following days. Ruth and her family fare better in their underground shelter, although Ruth's grandmother soon falls ill.\nAs the Sheffield council's efforts to maintain order fail, they slowly suffocate in their bunker, which is buried under the rubble of Sheffield Town Hall. Meanwhile, Ruth flees her shelter after her grandmother dies, discovering that society has collapsed over the course of nine days. Due to dangers posed by fallout, rescue efforts and attempts to control fires are halted; local authority has broken down, martial law has been implemented and survivors are left to fend for themselves. Ruth visits Jimmy's house, finding his mother's corpse. She takes Jimmy's bird-care book and searches for him at the hospital, which is under-equipped and overwhelmed by hundreds of wounded civilians. By the time she returns home, her parents have been killed by looters.\nWith food becoming scarce as a result of looting and fires, Ruth travels west to the countryside near Buxton. Food soon becomes the only form of currency as nuclear winter causes a severely diminished harvest and mass starvation. Ruth briefly reunites with Bob as the two reach Buxton, where local authorities unsuccessfully attempt to convince the residents to house refugees. She later gives birth to her daughter alone in an abandoned barn while a chained dog snarls at her outside. One year later, sunlight levels have mostly returned to normal, though damage to the ozone layer means that higher UV levels have increased the risks of cataracts and skin cancer.\nA decade later, Britain's surviving population has dropped to between 4\u201311 million people \u2013 similar to the Middle Ages \u2013 and the country remains devastated. Ruth and her daughter Jane work in the fields with other survivors, cultivating crops by hand. Due to the absence of organised schooling, fetal radiation exposure, and the elective mutism of many adult survivors, many children born after the war, including Jane, speak non-standard English. Ruth dies in bed, prematurely aged and blinded by cataracts. She is survived by Jane, who stands by her bed as she dies. Jane responds with apathy to her mother's death and takes the last of her possessions, leaving behind Jimmy's bird book, which Ruth had kept with her.\nThree years later, industry resumes via limited steam power, although the population still lives in squalor. Jane and two boys are caught stealing food. One of the boys is shot dead, while Jane and the other boy engage in a struggle for food that degenerates into sex. Jane gives birth months later in a makeshift hospital, where the nurse wraps the silent baby in a bloody sheet and gives it to Jane, who looks at it in horror.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProduction and themes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOur intention in making \"Threads\" was to step aside from the politics and \u2013 I hope convincingly \u2013 show the actual effects on either side should our best endeavours to prevent nuclear war fail.\n \n\"Threads\" was first commissioned (under the working title \"Beyond Armageddon\") by the Director-General of the BBC Alasdair Milne, after he watched the 1966 drama-documentary \"The War Game\", which had not been shown on the BBC when it was made, due to pressure from the Wilson government, although it had a limited release in cinemas. Mick Jackson was hired to direct the film, as he had previously worked in the area of nuclear apocalypse in 1982, producing the BBC \"Q.E.D.\" documentary \"A Guide to Armageddon\". This was considered a breakthrough at the time, considering the previous banning of \"The War Game\", which BBC staff believed would have resulted in mass suicides if aired. Jackson subsequently travelled around the UK and the US, consulting leading scientists, psychologists, doctors, defence specialists and strategic experts to create the most realistic depiction of nuclear war possible for his next film. Jackson consulted various sources in his research, including the 1983 \"Science\" article \"Nuclear Winter: Global Consequences of Multiple Nuclear Explosions\", penned by Carl Sagan and James B. Pollack. Details of a possible attack scenario and the extent of the damage were derived from \"Doomsday, Britain after Nuclear Attack\" (1983), while the ineffective post-war plans of the British government came from Duncan Campbell's 1982 expos\u00e9 \"War Plan UK\". In portraying the psychological damage suffered by survivors, Jackson took inspiration from the behaviour of the Hibakusha and Magnus Clarke's 1982 book \"Nuclear Destruction of Britain\". Sheffield was chosen as the main location partly because of its \"nuclear-free zone\" policy that made the council sympathetic to the local filming and partly because it seemed likely that the USSR would strike an industrial city in the centre of the country.\nJackson hired Barry Hines to write the script because of his political awareness. The relationship between the two was strained on several occasions, as Hines spent much of his time on set, and apparently disliked Jackson on account of his middle class upbringing. They also disagreed about Paul Vaughan's narration, which Hines felt was detrimental to the drama. As part of their research, the two spent a week at the Home Office training centre for \"official survivors\" in Easingwold which, according to Hines, showed just \"how disorganised [post-war reconstruction] would be\". A subsequent request by Jackson for the Home Office to provide him with a copy of the training notes was approved on the basis that refusal \"could cause offence and give the impression that [the Home Office] had something to hide\", with a similar logic underpinning the decision to give him the full and unredacted notes.\nAuditions were advertised in \"The Star\", and took place in the ballroom of Sheffield City Hall, where 1,100 candidates turned up. Extras were chosen on the basis of height and age, and were all told to look \"miserable\" and to wear ragged clothes; the majority were CND supporters. The makeup for extras playing third-degree-burn victims consisted of Rice Krispies and tomato ketchup, while the prop umbilical cord that Ruth bites through after giving birth to Jane was made from liquorice. The scenes taking place six weeks after the attack were shot at Curbar Edge in the Peak District National Park; because weather conditions were considered too fine to pass off as a nuclear winter, stage snow had to be spread around the rocks and heather, and cameramen installed light filters on their equipment to block out the sunlight. Although Jackson initially considered casting actors from Granada Television's \"Coronation Street\", he later decided to take a neorealist approach, and opted to cast relatively unknown actors to heighten the film's impact through the use of characters the audience could relate to. He also made an effort to leave some things (such as the exact state of Jane's baby) unseen, \"to let images and emotion happen in people's minds, or rather in the extensions of their imaginations\" and so enhance the horror effect.\nThe circumstances in which Jane's child is conceived towards the end of the film have been interpreted as rape. The screenplay states that \"their wrestling turns sexual, and we hear JANE exclaiming as they have crude intercourse.\"\nRelease history.\nBroadcast.\n\"Threads\" was a co-production of the BBC, Nine Network and Western-World Television, Inc. It was first broadcast on BBC Two on 23 September 1984 at 9:30\u00a0pm, and achieved the highest ratings on the channel (6.9\u00a0million) of the week. The cast and around six hundred extras from the Sheffield area were invited to a private screening at the Fiesta Nightclub ahead of the official broadcast. It was repeated on BBC One on 1 August 1985 as part of a week of programmes marking the fortieth anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which also saw the first television screening of \"The War Game\" (which had been deemed too disturbing for television in the 20 years since it had been made). \"Threads\" was not shown again on British screens until the digital channel BBC Four broadcast it in October 2003. It was also shown on UKTV Documentary in September 2004 and April 2005. In January 2018, nuclear history journalist Julie McDowall led a distributed viewing of the film, encouraging the audience to share their reactions on Twitter under the hashtag #threaddread, as part of a campaign to ask the BBC to show the film for the first time since 2003. A new BBC broadcast, again on BBC Four, eventually took place on 9 October 2024 to mark the film's fortieth anniversary.\n\"Threads\" was broadcast in the United States on cable network Superstation TBS on 13 January 1985, with Ted Turner presenting the introduction. This was followed the next day by a broadcast of an episode of BBC documentary series \"Natural World\", \"On the Eighth Day\", about nuclear winter, and a panel discussion on nuclear war. It was also shown in syndication to local commercial stations and, later, on many PBS stations. In Canada, \"Threads\" was broadcast on Citytv in Toronto, CKVU in Vancouver and CKND in Winnipeg, in New Zealand on TVNZ in September 1984, and in Australia it was shown on the Nine Network on 19 June 1985. Unusually for a commercial network, it broadcast the film without commercial breaks; many commercial outlets in the United States and Canada that broadcast the film also did so without commercial interruption, or interrupting only for disclaimers or promos.\nHome media.\n\"Threads\" was originally released by BBC Video (on VHS and, for a very short period, Betamax) in 1987 in the United Kingdom. The film was re-released on both VHS and DVD in 2000 on the Revelation label, followed by a new DVD edition in 2005. Due to licensing difficulties the 1987 release replaced Chuck Berry's recording of his song \"Johnny B. Goode\" with an alternative recording of the song. In all these cases, the original music over the opening narration was removed, again due to licensing problems; this was an extract from the Alpine Symphony by Richard Strauss, performed by the Dresden State Opera Orchestra, conducted by Rudolf Kempe (HMV ASD 3173).\nOn 13 February 2018, \"Threads\" was released by Severin Films on Blu-ray in the United States. The programme was scanned in 2K from a broadcast print for this release, including extras such as an audio commentary with Director Mick Jackson and interviews with actress Karen Meagher, Director Of Photography Andrew Dunn, Production Designer Christopher Robilliard and film writer Stephen Thrower. This is also the first home video release in which the extract from the Alpine Symphony remains intact.\nOn 9 April 2018, Simply Media released a Special Edition DVD in the UK, featuring a different 2K scan, restored and remastered from the original BBC 16mm CRI prints, which Severin did not have access to. This also featured all the original music, for the first time on home video in the UK. The Special Edition included commentaries and associated documentaries.\nReception and legacy.\nContemporary.\n\"Threads\" was not widely reviewed, but the critics who reviewed it gave generally positive reviews. John J. O'Connor of \"The New York Times\" wrote that the film \"is not a balanced discussion about the pros and cons of nuclear armaments. It is a candidly biased warning. And it is, as calculated, unsettlingly powerful.\" Rick Groen of \"The Globe and Mail\" wrote that \"[t]he British crew here, headed by writer Barry Hines and producer/director Mick Jackson, accomplish what would seem to be an impossible task: depicting the carnage without distancing the viewer, without once letting him retreat behind the safe wall of fictitious play. Formidable and foreboding, \"Threads\" leaves nothing to our imagination, and Nothingness to our conscience.\" In his movie guide, Leonard Maltin gave the film a rating of three stars (out of a possible four). He called \"Threads\" \"Britain's answer to \"The Day After\"\" and wrote that the film was \"unrelentingly graphic and grim, sobering, and shattering- as it should be\".\nJackson recalled that while BBC productions would usually be followed by congratulatory phone calls from friends and colleagues immediately after airing, no such calls came after the first screening of \"Threads\". Initially thinking that the film had been poorly received, he later realised that \"people had switched off their TVs and just sat quietly thinking, in some cases too troubled to go to sleep or maybe not wanting to risk bad dreams\". He stated that he had it on good authority that Ronald Reagan watched the film when it aired in the US. Neil Kinnock, then Labour Party leader, wrote a letter to Jackson and Hines in which he thanked them for their \"important and impressive work\" and told them not to be worried by the possibility of viewers becoming inured to a potential nuclear war since \"the dangers of complacency are much greater than any risks of knowledge\".\nRetrospective.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Threads\" works on the viewer with a peculiar power: one finds oneself horrified, fascinated, numbed, provoked, unsettled, made restless. Its power may be the effect of its oscillation between form and content being so heavily weighted toward the pole of content\u2014in this case, that threat of nuclear destruction which cannot help but feel 'real'--so that we are unable to relax into \"Threads\" as 'just' a movie.\nRetrospective reviews have been very positive. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 92 based on 5 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\", whilst it has a Rotten Tomatoes score of 100% based on 15 reviews (with an average score of 8.90/10). The critical consensus reads: \"An urgent warning against nuclear conflict, \"Threads\" is a chilling hypothetical that achieves visceral horror with its matter-of-fact presentation of an apocalypse\".\nPeter Bradshaw of \"The Guardian\" called the film a \"masterpiece\", writing: \"It wasn't until I saw \"Threads\" that I found that something on screen could make me break out in a cold, shivering sweat and keep me in that condition for 20 minutes, followed by weeks of depression and anxiety\". Sam Toy of \"Empire\" gave the film a perfect score, writing that \"this British work of (technically) science fiction teaches an unforgettable lesson in true horror\" and went on to praise its ability \"to create an almost impossible illusion on clearly paltry funds\". Jonathan Hatfull of \"SciFiNow\" gave a perfect score to the remastered DVD of the film. \"No one ever forgets the experience of watching \"Threads\". [...It] is arguably the most devastating piece of television ever produced. It's perfectly crafted, totally human and so completely harrowing you'll think that you'll probably never want to watch it again.\" He praised the pacing and Hines' \"impeccable\" screenplay and described its portrayal of the \"immediate effects\" of the bombing as \"jaw-dropping [...] watching the survivors in the days and weeks to come is heart-breaking\". Both \"Little White Lies\" and \"The A.V. Club\" have emphasized the film's contemporary relevance, especially in light of political events such as Brexit. According to the former, the film paints a \"nightmarish picture of a Britain woefully unprepared for what is coming, and reduced, when it does come, to isolation, collapse and medieval regression, with a failed health service, very little food being harvested, mass homelessness, and the pound and the penny losing all value\".\nMichael Beecroft was cast in the film as a traffic warden guarding an improvised detention camp. At the time, Beecroft was working as a traffic warden in real life. Even though he only appears for approximately thirty seconds in the finished film, still photography of his bandaged, rifle-wielding character was used to publicise the film's initial release (including a prominent appearance on the front cover of the 22\u201328 September 1984 issue of \"Radio Times\"), has regularly appeared in subsequent promotional material including the cover artwork on home video releases, and has endured in the popular memory to the point of an action figure being made and people dressing up as the character for Halloween and convention cosplays. Beecroft's identity was unknown until 2024, when he was found by BBC Radio Sheffield as a result of a social media campaign by Craig Ian Mann (who made the making-of documentary accompanying the United States Blu-Ray release) and his co-writer Robert Nevitt; during the subsequent conversation with Mann, Beecroft was \"gobsmacked\" and \"totally amazed\" by the popular reaction to his brief role.\nIn April 2025, it was announced that Warp Films, which had recently been involved with the critically and popularly successful miniseries \"Adolescence\", had acquired the option to develop a serialised adaptation of \"Threads\".\nAwards and nominations.\nThe film was nominated for seven BAFTA awards in 1985. It won for Best Single Drama, Best Design, and . Its other nominations were for Best Costume Design, Best Make-Up, and .\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Wikipedias in English and many other languages were powered by UseModWiki until switching to MediaWiki.\nHistory.\nAfter Ward Cunningham created the first wiki website WikiWikiWeb, there were various \"WikiWikiClones\" that implemented the functions and design of WikiWikiWeb's engine (\"WikiBase\"), mainly written in Perl. Peter Merel developed which was an early WikiWikiClone released partially under the GNU Lesser General Public License, and Markus Denker then developed which was released under the GNU General Public License and based on CVWiki.\nIn the 1990s, Clifford Adams initiated the Usenet Moderation project that would allow users to share rating, editing, and eventually summary/change information about Usenet postings. It was replaced by the concept of wikis in 1999, and the development of UseModWiki started on October 11 as a simplified fork of AtisWiki. From version 0.4 (\"WikiFour\") in November 1999, more functions and improvements were introduced to UseModWiki. In 2000, the second UseModWiki website MeatballWiki was launched and hosted in \"usemod.com\", along with the official website of UseModWiki.\nIn 2001, as Adams was both of the UseModWiki developer and a Wikipedian, he brought many improvements for the usages of an encyclopedia to v0.91 and v0.92, especially \"s\" that uses double square-brackets (e.g., codice_1) as an option for linking to another page, supplementing the older functionality of using camel case. In September 2003, after two years of development from the previous version, the release of version 1.0 introduced many new features including CSS, RSS, file uploads, UTF-8.\nThe development was then halted, and a cross-site scripting vulnerability (CVE-2004-1397) was discovered in December 2004. It was patched in July 2007 when Markus Lude took over the project of UseModWiki from Clifford Adams, with the release of version 1.0.1. Only bug fixing versions were released since that. The official domain was moved to \"usemod.org\" in late September 2023, and a minor update for that change was released later in November.\nUse by Wikipedia.\nThe wiki software for the English Wikipedia was UseModWiki (phase I, retroactively) since the establishment on January 15, 2001, and as of January 2002, Wikipedias in 22 languages were powered by UseModWiki. The English edition switched to \"\" (phase II) on January 25, 2002, a new wiki software based on UseModWiki but rewritten in PHP. On July 20, \"the PHP script\" was then replaced by its own rewritten wiki software (phase III), currently known as MediaWiki, for better performance and functionality.\nOther language editions gradually switched to MediaWiki afterwards, and as of late 2003, only a few active editions including Catalan Wikipedia were still powered by UseModWiki. In 2004, the last-remaining UseModWiki editions switched to MediaWiki.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It superseded the Articles of Confederation, the nation's first constitution, on March 4, 1789. Originally including seven articles, the Constitution defined the foundational structure of the federal government.\nThe drafting of the Constitution by many of the nation's Founding Fathers, often referred to as its framing, was completed at the Constitutional Convention, which assembled at Independence Hall in Philadelphia between May 25 and September 17, 1787. Influenced by English common law and the Enlightenment liberalism of philosophers like John Locke and Montesquieu, the Constitution's first three articles embody the doctrine of the separation of powers, in which the federal government is divided into the legislative, bicameral Congress; the executive, led by the president; and the judiciary, within which the Supreme Court has apex jurisdiction. Articles IV, V, and VI embody concepts of federalism, describing the rights and responsibilities of state governments, the states in relationship to the federal government, and the process of constitutional amendment. Article VII establishes the procedure used to ratify the constitution. \nSince the Constitution became operational in 1789, it has been amended 27 times. The first ten amendments, known collectively as the Bill of Rights, offer specific protections of individual liberty and justice and place restrictions on the powers of government within the U.S. states. Amendments 13\u201315 are known as the Reconstruction Amendments. The majority of the later amendments expand individual civil rights protections, with some addressing issues related to federal authority or modifying government processes and procedures. Amendments to the United States Constitution, unlike ones made to many constitutions worldwide, are appended to the document. \nThe Constitution of the United States is the oldest and longest-standing written and codified national constitution in force in the world. The first permanent constitution, it has been interpreted, supplemented, and implemented by a large body of federal constitutional law and has influenced the constitutions of other nations.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nFrom September 5, 1774, to March 1, 1781, the Second Continental Congress, convened in Philadelphia in what is now Independence Hall, functioned as the provisional government of the United States. Delegates to the First Continental Congress in 1774 and then the Second Continental Congress from 1775 to 1781 were chosen largely from the revolutionary committees of correspondence in various colonies rather than through the colonial governments of the Thirteen Colonies.\nThe Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union was the first constitution of the United States. The document was drafted by a committee appointed by the Second Continental Congress in mid-June 1777 and was adopted by the full Congress in mid-November of that year. Ratification by the 13 colonies took more than three years and was completed March 1, 1781. The Articles gave little power to the central government. While the Confederation Congress had some decision-making abilities, it lacked enforcement powers. The implementation of most decisions, including amendments to the Articles, required legislative approval by all 13 of the newly formed states.\nDespite these limitations, based on the Congressional authority granted in Article 9, the league of states was considered as as any similar republican confederation ever formed. The chief problem was, in the words of George Washington, \"no money\". The Confederated Congress could print money, but it was worthless, and while the Congress could borrow money, it could not pay it back. No state paid its share of taxes to support the government, and some paid nothing. A few states met the interest payments toward the national debt owed by their citizens, but nothing greater, and no interest was paid on debts owed to foreign governments. By 1786, the United States was facing default on its outstanding debts.\nUnder the Articles, the United States had little ability to defend its sovereignty. Most of the troops in the nation's 625-man army were deployed facing non-threatening British forts on American soil. Soldiers were not being paid, some were deserting, and others were threatening mutiny. Spain closed New Orleans to American commerce, despite the protests of U.S. officials. When Barbary pirates began seizing American ships of commerce, the Treasury had no funds to pay toward ransom. If a military crisis required action, the Congress had no credit or taxing power to finance a response.\nDomestically, the Articles of Confederation was failing to bring unity to the diverse sentiments and interests of the various states. Although the Treaty of Paris in 1783 was signed between Britain and the U.S., and named each of the American states, various states proceeded to violate it. New York and South Carolina repeatedly prosecuted Loyalists for wartime activity and redistributed their lands. Individual state legislatures independently laid embargoes, negotiated directly with foreign authorities, raised armies, and made war, all violating the letter and the spirit of the Articles.\nIn September 1786, during the inter\u2013state Annapolis convention to discuss and develop a consensus about reversing the protectionist trade barriers that each state had erected, James Madison questioned whether the Articles of Confederation was a binding compact or even a viable government. Connecticut paid nothing and \"positively refused\" to pay U.S. assessments for two years. A rumor at the time was that a seditious party of New York legislators had opened a conversation with the Viceroy of Canada. To the south, the British were said to be openly funding Creek Indian raids on Georgia, and the state was under martial law. Additionally, during Shays' Rebellion (August 1786\u00a0\u2013 June 1787) in Massachusetts, Congress could provide no money to support an endangered constituent state. General Benjamin Lincoln was obliged to raise funds from Boston merchants to pay for a volunteer army.\nCongress could do nothing significant without nine states, and some legislation required all 13. When a state produced only one member in attendance, its vote was not counted. If a state's delegation was evenly divided, its vote could not be counted towards the nine-count requirement. The Congress of the Confederation had \"virtually ceased trying to govern\". The vision of a respectable nation among nations seemed to be fading in the eyes of revolutionaries such as George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and Rufus King. Their dream of a republic, a nation without hereditary rulers, with power derived from the people in frequent elections, was in doubt.\nOn February 21, 1787, the Confederation Congress called a convention of state delegates in Philadelphia to propose revisions to the Articles. Unlike earlier attempts, the convention was not meant for new laws or piecemeal alterations, but for the \"sole and express purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation\". The convention was not limited to commerce but intended to \"render the federal constitution adequate to the exigencies of government and the preservation of the Union\".\n1787 drafting.\nOn the appointed day, May 14, 1787, only the Virginia and Pennsylvania delegations were present, and the convention's opening meeting was postponed for lack of a quorum. A quorum of seven states met on May 25, and deliberations began. Eventually 12 states were represented, with Rhode Island refusing to participate. Of the 74 delegates appointed by the states, 55 attended. The convention's initial mandate was limited to amending the Articles of Confederation, which had proven highly ineffective in meeting the young nation's needs. Almost immediately, however, the delegates began considering measures to replace the Articles of Confederation. \nTwo plans for structuring the federal government arose shortly after the convention's outset:\nOn May 31, the Convention devolved into the Committee of the Whole, charged with considering the Virginia Plan. On June 13, the Virginia resolutions in amended form were reported out of committee. The New Jersey Plan was put forward in response to the Virginia Plan.\nOn June 19, 1787, delegates rejected the New Jersey Plan with three states voting in favor, seven against, and one divided. The plan's defeat led to a series of compromises centering primarily on two issues: slavery and proportional representation.\nScope of judicial power.\nProposals by Madison (Virginia) and Wilson (Pennsylvania) called for a supreme court veto over national legislation. This proposal resembled the system in New York, where the Constitution of 1777 called for a \"Council of Revision\" by the governor and justices of the state supreme court, which council would review and veto any passed legislation. Madison's proposal was defeated three times and replaced by a presidential veto with congressional override.\nThe justification for judicial review is to be explicitly found in the open ratifications held in the states and reported in their newspapers. John Marshall in Virginia, James Wilson in Pennsylvania and Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut all argued for Supreme Court judicial review of acts of state legislature. In Federalist No. 78, Alexander Hamilton advocated the doctrine of a written document held as a superior enactment of the people. \"A limited constitution can be preserved in practice no other way\" than through courts which can declare void any legislation contrary to the Constitution. The preservation of the people's authority over legislatures rests \"particularly with judges.\"\nConnecticut and Three-Fifths Compromise.\nThe issue of proportional representation was of concern to less populous states, which under the Articles had the same power as larger states. From July 2 to 16, a Committee of Eleven, including one delegate from each state represented, met to work out a compromise on the issue of representation in the federal legislature. All agreed to a republican form of government grounded in representing the people in the states. For the legislature, two issues were to be decided: (i) how the votes were to be allocated among the states in the Congress, and (ii) how the representatives should be elected. In its report, now known as the Connecticut Compromise (or \"Great Compromise\"), the committee proposed proportional representation for seats in the House of Representatives based on population (with the people voting for representatives), equal representation for each state in the Senate (with each state's legislators generally choosing their respective senators), and that all money bills would originate in the House.\nThe Great Compromise ended the stalemate between patriots and nationalists, leading to numerous other compromises in a spirit of accommodation. The issue of slavery pitted Northern states, where slavery was slowly being abolished, against Southern states, whose agricultural economies depended on slave labor. To satisfy interests in the South, the delegates agreed to protect the slave trade for 20 years. Slavery was protected further by the Three-Fifths Compromise, which allowed states to count three-fifths of their slaves as part of their populations, for the purpose of representation in the federal government, and by requiring the return of escaped slaves to their owners, even if captured in states where slavery had been abolished. Further compromises were also made on presidential term, powers, and method of selection, as well as the jurisdiction of the federal judiciary.\nWhile these compromises held the Union together and aided the Constitution's ratification, slavery continued for six more decades, and less populous states continue to have disproportional representation in the U.S. Senate and Electoral College.\nDrafting and signature.\nOn July 24, a Committee of Detail, including John Rutledge (South Carolina), Edmund Randolph (Virginia), Nathaniel Gorham (Massachusetts), Oliver Ellsworth (Connecticut), and James Wilson (Pennsylvania), was elected to draft a detailed constitution reflective of the resolutions passed by the convention up to that point. The Convention recessed from July 26 to August 6 to await the report of this \"Committee of Detail\". Overall, the report of the committee conformed to the resolutions adopted by the convention, adding some elements. A twenty-three article (plus preamble) constitution was presented.\nFrom August 6 to September 10, the report of the committee of detail was discussed, section by section and clause by clause. Details were attended to, and further compromises were effected. Toward the close of these discussions, on September 8, a Committee of Style and Arrangement, including Alexander Hamilton from New York, William Samuel Johnson from Connecticut, Rufus King from Massachusetts, James Madison from Virginia, and Gouverneur Morris from Pennsylvania, was appointed to distill a final draft constitution from the 23 approved articles. The final draft, presented to the convention on September 12, contained seven articles, a preamble and a closing endorsement, of which Morris was the primary author. The committee also presented a proposed letter to accompany the constitution when delivered to Congress.\nThe original U.S. Constitution was handwritten on five pages of parchment by Jacob Shallus. The final document was taken up on Monday, September 17, at the convention's final session. Several of the delegates were disappointed in the result, a makeshift series of unfortunate compromises. Some delegates left before the ceremony and three others refused to sign. Of the thirty-nine signers, Benjamin Franklin summed up, addressing the convention: \"There are several parts of this Constitution which I do not at present approve, but I am not sure I shall never approve them.\" He would accept the Constitution, \"because I expect no better and because I am not sure that it is not the best\".\nThe advocates of the Constitution were anxious to obtain unanimous support of all twelve states represented in the convention. Their accepted formula for the closing endorsement was \"Done in Convention, by the unanimous consent of the States present\". At the end of the convention, the proposal was agreed to by eleven state delegations and the lone remaining delegate from New York, Alexander Hamilton.\nRatification by the states.\nWithin three days of its signing on September 17, 1787, the Constitution was submitted to the Congress of the Confederation, then sitting in New York City, the nation's temporary capital. The document, originally intended as a revision of the Articles of Confederation, instead introduced a completely new form of government. While members of Congress had the power to reject it, they voted unanimously on September 28 to forward the proposal to the thirteen states for their ratification. Under the process outlined in Article VII of the proposed Constitution, the state legislatures were tasked with organizing \"Federal Conventions\" to ratify the document. This process ignored the amendment provision of the Articles of Confederation which required unanimous approval of all the states. Instead, Article VII called for ratification by just nine of the 13 states\u2014a two-thirds majority.\nTwo factions soon emerged, one supporting the Constitution, the Federalists, and the other opposing it, the so-called Anti-Federalists. Over the ensuing months, the proposal was debated, criticized, and expounded upon clause by clause. In the state of New York, at the time a hotbed of anti-Federalism, three delegates from the Philadelphia Convention who were also members of the Congress\u2014Hamilton, Madison, and Jay\u2014published a series of commentaries, now known as \"The Federalist Papers\", in support of ratification.\nBefore year's end, three state legislatures voted in favor of ratification. Delaware was first, voting unanimously 30\u20130; Pennsylvania second, approving the measure 46\u201323; and New Jersey third, also recording a unanimous vote. As 1788 began, Connecticut and Georgia followed Delaware's lead with almost unanimous votes, but the outcome became less certain as leaders in key states such as Virginia, New York, and Massachusetts expressed concerns over the lack of protections for people's rights. Fearing the prospect of defeat, the Federalists relented, promising that if the Constitution was adopted, amendments would be added to secure individual liberties. With that, the anti-Federalists' position collapsed.\nOn June 21, 1788, New Hampshire became the ninth state to ratify. Three months later, on September 17, the Congress of the Confederation certified the ratification of eleven states, and passed resolutions setting dates for choosing the first senators and representatives, the first Wednesday of January (January 7, 1789); electing the first president, the first Wednesday of February (February 4); and officially starting the new government, the first Wednesday of March (March 4), when the first Congress would convene in New York City. As its final act, the Congress of Confederation agreed to acquire 100 square miles of land from Maryland and Virginia for establishing a permanent capital.\nNorth Carolina waited to ratify the Constitution until after the Bill of Rights was passed by the new Congress, and Rhode Island's ratification would only come after a threatened trade embargo.\nAftermath.\nFederal judiciary.\nThe Supreme Court was initially made up of jurists who had been intimately connected with the framing of the Constitution and the establishment of its government as law. John Jay (New York), a co-author of \"The Federalist Papers\", served as chief justice for the first six years. The second chief justice, John Rutledge (South Carolina), was appointed by Washington in 1795 as a recess appointment, but was not confirmed by the Senate. Resigning later that year, he was succeeded in 1796 by the third chief justice, Oliver Ellsworth (Connecticut). Both Rutledge and Ellsworth were delegates to the Constitutional Convention. John Marshall (Virginia), the fourth chief justice, had served in the Virginia Ratification Convention in 1788. His 34 years of service on the Court would see some of the most important rulings to help establish the nation the Constitution had begun. Other early members of the Supreme Court who had been delegates to the Constitutional Convention included James Wilson (Pennsylvania) for ten years, and John Blair Jr. (Virginia) for five years.\nSection 1, Article 3 provides that Congress can create lower courts. The Judiciary Act of 1789 saw Congress's first exercise of such power. Currently, Title 28 of the U.S. Code describes judicial powers and administration. As of the First Congress, the Supreme Court justices rode circuit to sit as panels to hear appeals from the district courts. In 1891, Congress enacted a new system, where district courts would have original jurisdiction; intermediate appellate circuit courts with exclusive jurisdiction heard regional appeals before consideration by the Supreme Court; and the Supreme Court holds discretionary jurisdiction.\nNo part of the Constitution expressly authorizes judicial review, but the framers did contemplate the idea, and precedent has since established that the courts could exercise judicial review over the actions of Congress or the executive branch. To establish a federal system of national law, considerable effort goes into developing a spirit of comity between federal government and states. By the doctrine of res judicata, federal courts give \"full faith and credit\" to State Courts. The Supreme Court will decide Constitutional issues of state law only on a case-by-case basis, and only by strict Constitutional necessity, independent of state legislators' motives, their policy outcomes or its national wisdom. Two conflicting federal laws are under \"pendent\" jurisdiction if one presents a strict constitutional issue. Federal court jurisdiction is rare when a state legislature enacts something as under federal jurisdiction.\nAmendments.\nClauses 4 and 9 of Article One, Section 9 were explicitly shielded from Constitutional amendment prior to 1808. On January 1, 1808, the first day it was permitted to do so, Congress approved legislation prohibiting the importation of slaves into the country. On February 3, 1913, with ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment, Congress gained the authority to levy an income tax without apportioning it among the states or basing it on the United States Census. \nInfluences.\nThe U.S. Constitution was a federal one and was greatly influenced by the study of Magna Carta and other federations, both ancient and extant. The Due Process Clause of the Constitution was partly based on common law and on Magna Carta (1215), which had become a foundation of English liberty against arbitrary power wielded by a ruler. The idea of Separation of Powers inherent in the Constitution was largely inspired by eighteenth-century Enlightenment philosophers, such as Montesquieu and John Locke.\nThe influence of Montesquieu, Locke, Edward Coke and William Blackstone were evident at the Constitutional Convention. Prior to and during the framing and signing of the Constitution, Blackstone, Hume, Locke and Montesquieu were among the political philosophers most frequently referred to. James Madison, for example made frequent reference to Blackstone, Locke, and Montesquieu, who were among the most prominent political theorists of the late eighteenth century. \nWhile the ideas of unalienable rights, the separation of powers and the structure of the Constitution were largely influenced by the European Enlightenment thinkers, like Montesquieu, John Locke and others, Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson still had reservations about the existing forms of government in Europe. In a speech at the Constitutional Convention Franklin stated, \"We have gone back to ancient history for models of Government, and examined different forms of those Republics\u00a0... And we have viewed modern States all round Europe but find none of their Constitutions suitable to our circumstances.\" Jefferson maintained, that most European governments were autocratic monarchies and not compatible with the egalitarian character of the American people. \nEnglish law.\nHistorian Jack P. Greene maintains that by 1776 the founders drew heavily upon Magna Carta and the later writings of \"Enlightenment rationalism\" and English common law. \nIn his \"Institutes of the Lawes of England\", Coke interpreted Magna Carta protections and rights to apply not just to nobles, but to all British subjects. In writing the Virginia Charter of 1606, he enabled the King in Parliament to give those to be born in the colonies all rights and liberties as though they were born in England. William Blackstone's \"Commentaries on the Laws of England\" are considered the most influential books on law in the new republic. \nThe English Bill of Rights (1689) was an inspiration for the American Bill of Rights. Both require jury trials, contain a right to keep and bear arms, prohibit excessive bail and forbid \"cruel and unusual punishments\". Many liberties protected by state constitutions and the Virginia Declaration of Rights were incorporated into the Bill of Rights. Upon the arrival of the American Revolution, many of the rights guaranteed by the Federal Bill of Rights were recognized as being inspired by English law. A substantial body of thought had been developed from the literature of republicanism in the United States, typically demonstrated by the works of John Adams, who often quoted Blackstone and Montesquieu verbatim, and applied to the creation of state constitutions.\nEnlightenment philosophy.\nHistorian Herbert W. Schneider held that the Scottish Enlightenment was \"probably the most potent single tradition in the American Enlightenment\" and the advancement of personal liberties. Historian Daniel Walker Howe notes that Benjamin Franklin greatly admired David Hume, an eighteenth-century Scottish philosopher, and had studied many of his works while at Edinburgh in 1760. Both embraced the idea that high-ranking public officials should receive no salary and that the lower class was a better judge of character when it came to choosing their representatives.\nFollowing the Glorious Revolution of 1688, British political philosopher John Locke was a major influence, expanding on the contract theory of government advanced by Thomas Hobbes, his contemporary. Locke advanced the principle of consent of the governed in his \"Two Treatises of Government\". Government's duty under a social contract among the sovereign people was to serve the people by protecting their rights. These basic rights were life, liberty, and property.\nMontesquieu's influence on the framers is evident in Madison's \"Federalist No. 47\" and Hamilton's \"Federalist No. 78\". Thomas Jefferson, Adams, and Mason were known to read Montesquieu. Montesquieu emphasized the need for balanced forces pushing against each other to prevent tyranny (reflecting the influence of Polybius's 2nd century BC treatise on the checks and balances of the Roman Republic). In his \"The Spirit of Law\", Montesquieu maintained that the separation of state powers should be by its service to the people's liberty: legislative, executive and judicial, while also emphasizing that the idea of separation had for its purpose the even distribution of authority among the several branches of government.\nSupreme Court Justices, the ultimate interpreters of the constitution, have also cited Montesquieu throughout the Court's history. (See, \"e.g.\", , 21 1, 1, 36 (). , 39 430, 438 (). , 272 52, 116 (). , 433 425, 442 (). , 136 1310, 1330 ().) \nIroquois.\nAmerican Indian history scholars Donald Grinde and Bruce Johansen claim there is \"overwhelming evidence\" that Iroquois Confederacy political concepts and ideas influenced the U.S. Constitution, and are considered to be the most outspoken supporters of the Iroquois thesis. The idea as to the extent of that influence on the founding, however, varies among historians and has been questioned or criticized by various historians, including Samuel Payne, William Starna, George Hamell, and historian and archaeologist Philip Levy, who claims the evidence is largely coincidental and circumstantial. The most outspoken critic, anthropologist Elisabeth Tooker, claimed the Iroquois influence thesis is largely the product of \"white interpretations of Indians\" and \"scholarly misapprehension\".\nJohn Napoleon Brinton Hewitt, who was born on the Tuscarora Indian Reservation, and was an ethnologist at the Smithsonian Institution's Bureau of Ethnology is often cited by historians of Iroquois history. Hewitt, however, rejected the idea that the Iroquois League had a major influence on the Albany Plan of Union, Benjamin Franklin's plan to create a unified government for the Thirteen Colonies, which was rejected.\nStructure.\nThe Constitution includes four sections: an introductory paragraph titled Preamble, a list of seven Articles that define the government's framework, an untitled closing endorsement with the signatures of 39 framers. 27 amendments have also been adopted under Article V.\nPreamble.\nThe Preamble, the Constitution's introductory paragraph, lays out the purposes of the new government:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.\nThe opening words, \"We the People\", represented a new thought: the idea that the people and not the states were the source of the government's legitimacy. Coined by Gouverneur Morris of Pennsylvania, who chaired the convention's Committee of Style, the phrase is considered an improvement on the section's original draft which followed the words \"We the People\" with a list of the 13 states. In place of the names of the states Morris substituted \"of the United States\" and then listed the Constitution's six goals, none of which were mentioned originally.\nClosing endorsement.\nThe signing of the United States Constitution occurred on September 17, 1787, when 39 delegates endorsed the constitution created during the convention. In addition to signatures, this closing endorsement, the Constitution's eschatocol, included a brief declaration that the delegates' work has been successfully completed and that those whose signatures appear on it subscribe to the final document. Included are a statement pronouncing the document's adoption by the states present, a formulaic dating of its adoption, and the delegates' signatures. Additionally, the convention's secretary, William Jackson, added a note to verify four amendments made by hand to the final document, and signed the note to authenticate its validity.\nThe language of the concluding endorsement, conceived by Gouverneur Morris and presented to the convention by Benjamin Franklin, was made intentionally ambiguous in hopes of winning over the votes of dissenting delegates. Advocates for the new frame of government, realizing the impending difficulty of obtaining the consent of the states needed to make it operational, were anxious to obtain the unanimous support of the delegations from each state. It was feared that many of the delegates would refuse to give their individual assent to the Constitution. Therefore, in order that the action of the convention would appear to be unanimous, the formula, \"Done in convention by the unanimous consent of the states present...\" was devised.\nArticles.\nThe Constitution's main provisions include seven articles that define the basic framework of the federal government. Articles that have been amended still include the original text, although provisions repealed by amendments under Article V are usually bracketed or italicized to indicate they no longer apply.\nArticle I \u2013 The Legislature.\nArticle I describes the Congress, the legislative branch of the federal government: Congress comprises both the Senate and House of Representatives; members of both houses are subject to age, citizenship, and state residency requirements; and are elected by the people of a state.\nSection 3, Clause 1 provides for equal representation of the states in the Senate. enumerates the powers delegated to the legislature and includes broad provisions such as the General Welfare Clause (also known as the Taxing and Spending Clause), Commerce Clause, and Necessary and Proper Clause. \n lists eight specific limits on congressional power. In \"McCulloch v. Maryland\" (1819), the Supreme Court read the Necessary and Proper Clause to permit the federal government to take action that would \"enable [it] to perform the high duties assigned to it [by the Constitution] in the manner most beneficial to the people,\" even if that action is not itself within the enumerated powers. Section 9, Clause1 prevents Congress from passing any law that would restrict the importation of slaves into the United States prior to 1808. Clause 4 holds that direct taxes must be apportioned according to state populations.\nArticle II \u2013 The Executive.\nArticle II describes the office, qualifications, and duties of the president of the United States and the vice president. The Article is modified by the 12th Amendment, which regulates presidential elections, and the 25th Amendment, relating to office succession.\nThe president is head of the executive branch of the federal government; the nation's head of state and head of government; and the Commander in Chief of the United States Armed Forces, as well as of state militias when they are mobilized. The president makes treaties of the Senate. To administer the federal government, the president commissions all the offices of the federal government as Congress directs; and may require the opinions of its principal officers and make \"recess appointments\" for vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate. The president ensures the laws are faithfully executed and may grant reprieves and pardons with the exception of Congressional impeachment. The president reports to Congress on the State of the Union, and by the Recommendation Clause, recommends \"necessary and expedient\" national measures. The president may convene and adjourn Congress under special circumstances.\nSection 4 provides for the removal of the president and other federal officers. The president is removed on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\nArticle III \u2013 The Judiciary.\nArticle III describes the court system, including the Supreme Court. Section 1 vests the judicial power of the United States in federal courts and, with it, the authority to interpret and apply the law to particular cases. Also included is the power to punish, sentence, and direct future action to resolve conflicts. Implied powers under Article III include the enforcement of judicial decisions through criminal contempt and civil contempt powers; injunctive relief and the habeas corpus remedy; and the ability to imprison for contumacy, bad-faith litigation, and failure to obey a writ of mandamus. \nClause1 of Section2, known as the Case or Controversy Clause, authorizes the federal courts to hear actual cases and controversies only. Their judicial power does not extend to cases that are hypothetical, or which are proscribed due to standing, mootness, or ripeness issues. Generally, a case or controversy requires the presence of adverse parties who have some interest genuinely at stake in the case. Section 2 also protects the right to trial by jury in all criminal cases. Section 3 bars Congress from changing or modifying Federal law on treason by simple majority. This section also defines treason as an overt act of making war or materially helping those at war with the United States. \nArticle IV \u2013 The States.\nArticle IV outlines the relations among the states and between each state and the federal government. It also provides for such matters as admitting new states, border changes between the states, and extradition between the states, as well as laying down a legal basis for freedom of movement and travel among the states. \nThe Full Faith and Credit Clause requires states to recognise the public acts, records, and court proceedings of the other states. Congress is permitted to regulate the manner in which proof of such acts may be admitted. The \"privileges and immunities\" clause prohibits state governments from discriminating against citizens of other states in favor of resident citizens. For instance, in criminal sentencing, a state may not increase a penalty on the grounds that the convicted person is a non-resident. The Territorial Clause gives Congress the power to make rules for disposing of federal property and governing non-state territories of the United States. Finally, the fourth section of Article Four requires the United States to guarantee to each state a republican form of government and to protect them from invasion and violence.\nArticle V \u2013 Amendment Process.\nArticle V outlines the process for amending the Constitution. The Articles of Confederation provided that amendments were to be proposed by Congress and ratified by the unanimous vote of all 13 state legislatures. This proved to be a major flaw in the Articles, as it created an insurmountable obstacle to constitutional reform. The amendment process crafted during the Philadelphia Constitutional Convention was, according to The Federalist No. 43, designed to establish a balance between pliancy and rigidity. Article Five ends by shielding certain clauses in the Constitution from being amended. \nArticle VI \u2013 Federal Powers.\nArticle VI establishes that the Constitution and all federal laws and treaties made in accordance with it have supremacy over state laws, and that \"the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, any thing in the laws or constitutions of any state notwithstanding\". It validates national debt created under the Articles of Confederation and requires that all federal and state legislators, officers, and judges take oaths or affirmations to support the Constitution. This means that the states' constitutions and laws should not conflict with the laws of the federal constitution and that in case of a conflict, state judges are legally bound to honor the federal laws and constitution over those of any state. Article Six also states \"no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States\".\nArticle VII \u2013 Ratification.\nArticle VII describes the process for establishing the proposed new frame of government. Anticipating that the influence of many state politicians would be Antifederalist, delegates to the Philadelphia Convention provided for ratification of the Constitution by popularly elected ratifying conventions in each state. The convention method also made it possible that judges, ministers and others ineligible to serve in state legislatures, could be elected to a convention. Suspecting that Rhode Island, at least, might not ratify, delegates decided that the Constitution would go into effect as soon as nine states (two-thirds rounded up) ratified. Each of the remaining four states could then join the newly formed union by ratifying.\nAmendments.\nThe procedure for amending the Constitution is outlined in Article V and is currently overseen by the archivist of the United States. Between 1949 and 1985, it was overseen by the administrator of General Services, and before that by the secretary of state.\nUnder Article V, a proposal for an amendment must be adopted either by two-thirds of both houses of Congress or by a national convention that had been requested by two-thirds of the state legislatures. Following this, Congress decides whether the proposed amendment is to be ratified by state legislatures or state ratifying conventions. The proposed amendment along with the method of ratification is sent to the Office of the Federal Register, which copies it in slip law format and submits it to the states. To date, the convention method of proposal has never been tried and the convention method of ratification has only been used once, for the Twenty-first Amendment.\nA proposed amendment becomes an operative part of the Constitution as soon as it is ratified by three-fourths of the States (currently 38 of the 50 states). No additional action by Congress or anyone else after ratification is required. When the Office of the Federal Register verifies that it has received the required number of authenticated ratification documents, it drafts a formal proclamation for the Archivist to certify that the amendment is valid. This certification is published in the \"Federal Register\" and \"United States Statutes at Large\" and serves as official notice to Congress and the nation that the ratification process has been completed.\nThe Constitution has twenty-seven amendments. Structurally, the Constitution's original text and all prior amendments remain untouched. The precedent for this practice was set in 1789, when Congress considered and proposed the first several Constitutional amendments. Among these, Amendments 1\u201310 are collectively known as the Bill of Rights, and Amendments 13\u201315 are known as the Reconstruction Amendments. Excluding the Twenty-seventh Amendment, which was pending before the states for , the longest pending amendment that was successfully ratified was the Twenty-second Amendment, which took . The Twenty-sixth Amendment was ratified in the shortest time, days. The average ratification time for the first twenty-six amendments was 1year, 252 days; for all twenty-seven, 9years, 48 days.\nThe first ten Amendments introduced were referred to as the Bill of Rights which consists of 10 amendments that were added to the Constitution in 1791, as supporters of the Constitution had promised critics during the debates of 1788.\nBill of Rights (1791).\nFirst Amendment.\nThe First Amendment prohibits Congress from obstructing the exercise of certain individual freedoms: freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, and right to petition. Its Free Exercise Clause guarantees a person's right to hold whatever religious beliefs they want, and to freely exercise that belief; its Establishment Clause prevents the federal government from creating an official national church or favoring one set of religious beliefs over another.\nSecond Amendment.\nThe Second Amendment protects the right of individuals to keep and bear arms. The Supreme Court has ruled that this right applies to individuals, not merely to collective militias. It has also held that the government may regulate or place some limits on the manufacture, ownership and sale of firearms or other weapons. \nRequested by several states during the constitutional ratification debates, the amendment followed the efforts of the British to confiscate the colonists' firearms at the outbreak of the Revolutionary War. Patrick Henry had rhetorically asked, if the States would be stronger \"when we are totally disarmed, and when a British Guard shall be stationed in every house?\"\nThird Amendment.\nThe Third Amendment prohibits the federal government from forcing individuals to provide lodging to soldiers in their homes during peacetime without their consent. Requested by several states during the Constitutional ratification debates, the amendment reflected the lingering resentment over the Quartering Acts passed by the British Parliament during the Revolutionary War, which had allowed British soldiers to take over private homes for their own use.\nFourth Amendment.\nThe Fourth Amendment protects people against unreasonable searches and seizures of either self or property by government officials. A search can mean everything from a frisking by a police officer or to a demand for a blood test to a search of an individual's home or car. A seizure occurs when the government takes control of an individual or something in the possession of the individual. Items that are seized often are used as evidence when the individual is charged with a crime. It also imposes certain limitations on police investigating a crime and prevents the use of illegally obtained evidence at trial.\nFifth Amendment.\nThe Fifth Amendment establishes the requirement that a trial for a major crime may commence only after an indictment has been handed down by a grand jury; protects individuals from double jeopardy; prohibits punishment without due process of law; and provides that an accused person may not be compelled to reveal to the police, prosecutor, judge, or jury any information that might incriminate or be used against him or her in a court of law. Additionally, the Fifth Amendment also prohibits government from taking private property for public use without \"just compensation\", the basis of eminent domain in the United States.\nSixth Amendment.\nThe Sixth Amendment provides several protections and rights to an individual accused of a crime. The accused has the right to a fair, speedy, and public trial by a local and impartial jury. This right also protects defendants from secret proceedings that might encourage abuse of the justice system, enshrines a right to legal counsel if accused of a crime, guarantees that the accused may require witnesses to attend the trial and testify in the presence of the accused, and guarantees the accused a right to know the charges against them. In 1966, the Supreme Court ruled that, with the Fifth Amendment, this amendment requires what has become known as the \"Miranda\" warning.\nSeventh Amendment.\nThe Seventh Amendment extends the right to a jury trial to federal civil cases, and inhibits courts from overturning a jury's findings of fact. Although the Seventh Amendment itself says that it is limited to \"suits at common law\", meaning cases that triggered the right to a jury under English law, the amendment has been found to apply in lawsuits that are similar to the old common law cases. For example, the right to a jury trial applies to cases brought under federal statutes that prohibit race or gender discrimination in housing or employment. This amendment guarantees the right to a jury trial only in federal court, not in state court.\nEighth Amendment.\nThe Eighth Amendment protects people from having bail or fines set at an amount so high that it would be impossible for all but the richest defendants to pay, and also protects people from being subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. Although this phrase originally was intended to outlaw certain gruesome methods of punishment, it has been broadened over the years to protect against punishments that are grossly disproportionate to or too harsh for the particular crime. This provision has also been used to challenge prison conditions such as extremely unsanitary cells, overcrowding, insufficient medical care and deliberate failure by officials to protect inmates from one another.\nNinth Amendment.\nThe Ninth Amendment declares that individuals have other fundamental rights, in addition to those stated in the Constitution. During the Constitutional ratification debates, Anti-Federalists argued that a Bill of Rights should be added. The Federalists opposed it on grounds that a list would necessarily be incomplete but would be taken as explicit and exhaustive, thus enlarging the power of the federal government by implication. The Anti-Federalists persisted, and several state ratification conventions refused to ratify the Constitution without a more specific list of protections, so the First Congress added what became the Ninth Amendment as a compromise. Because the rights protected by the Ninth Amendment are not specified, they are referred to as \"unenumerated\". The Supreme Court has found that unenumerated rights include such important rights as the right to travel, the right to vote, the right to privacy, and the right to make important decisions about one's health care or body.\nTenth Amendment.\nThe Tenth Amendment (1791) was included in the Bill of Rights to further define the balance of power between the federal government and the states. The amendment states that the federal government has only those powers specifically granted by the Constitution. These powers include the power to declare war, to collect taxes, to regulate interstate business activities and others that are listed in the articles or in subsequent constitutional amendments. Any power not listed is, says the Tenth Amendment, left to the states or the people. While there is no specific list of what these \"reserved powers\" may be, the Supreme Court has ruled that laws affecting family relations, commerce within a state's own borders, abortion, and local law enforcement activities, are among those specifically reserved to the states or the people.\nRemaining Amendments (1795 \u2013 Present).\nEleventh Amendment (1795).\nThe Eleventh Amendment specifically prohibits federal courts from hearing cases in which a state is sued by an individual from another state or another country, thus extending to the states sovereign immunity protection from certain types of legal liability. has been affected by this amendment, which also overturned the Supreme Court's decision in \"Chisholm v. Georgia\" (1793).\nTwelfth Amendment (1804).\nThe Twelfth Amendment modifies the way the Electoral College chooses the president and vice president. It stipulates that each elector must cast a distinct vote for president and vice president, instead of two votes for president. It also suggests that the president and vice president should not be from the same state. is superseded by this amendment, which also extends the to become president to the vice president.\nReconstruction Amendments (1865 \u2013 1870).\nThe Thirteenth Amendment (1865) abolished slavery and involuntary servitude, except as punishment for a crime, and authorized Congress to enforce abolition. Though millions of slaves had been declared free by the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation, their post-Civil War status was unclear, as was the status of other millions. Congress intended the Thirteenth Amendment to be a proclamation of freedom for all slaves throughout the nation and to take the question of emancipation away from politics. This amendment rendered inoperative or moot several of the original parts of the constitution.\nThe Fourteenth Amendment (1868) granted United States citizenship to former slaves and to all persons \"subject to U.S. jurisdiction\". It also contained three new limits on state power: a state shall not violate a citizen's privileges or immunities; shall not deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law; and must guarantee all persons equal protection of the laws. These limitations dramatically expanded the protections of the Constitution. This amendment, according to the Supreme Court's Doctrine of Incorporation, makes most provisions of the Bill of Rights applicable to state and local governments as well. It superseded the mode of apportionment of representatives delineated in Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3, and also overturned the Supreme Court's decision in \"Dred Scott v. Sandford\" (1857).\nThe Fifteenth Amendment (1870) prohibits the use of race, color, or previous condition of servitude in determining which citizens may vote. The last of three post Civil War Reconstruction Amendments, it sought to abolish one of the key vestiges of slavery and to advance the civil rights and liberties of former slaves.\nSixteenth Amendment (1913).\nThe Sixteenth Amendment removed existing Constitutional constraints that limited the power of Congress to lay and collect taxes on income. Specifically, the apportionment constraints delineated in Article 1, Section 9, Clause 4 have been removed by this amendment, which also overturned an 1895 Supreme Court decision, in \"Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co.\", that declared an unapportioned federal income tax on rents, dividends, and interest unconstitutional. This amendment has become the basis for all subsequent federal income tax legislation and has greatly expanded the scope of federal taxing and spending in the years since.\nSeventeenth Amendment (1913).\nThe Seventeenth Amendment modifies the way senators are elected. It stipulates that senators are to be elected by direct popular vote. The amendment supersedes , Clauses1 and 2, under which the two senators from each state were elected by the state legislature. It also allows state legislatures to permit their governors to make temporary appointments until a special election can be held.\nProhibition Amendments (1919 \u2013 1933).\nThe Eighteenth Amendment (1919) prohibited the making, transporting, and selling of alcoholic beverages nationwide. It also authorized Congress to enact legislation enforcing this prohibition. Adopted at the urging of a national temperance movement, proponents believed that the use of alcohol was reckless and destructive and that prohibition would reduce crime and corruption, solve social problems, decrease the need for welfare and prisons, and improve the health of all Americans. During prohibition, it is estimated that alcohol consumption and alcohol related deaths declined dramatically. But prohibition had other, more negative consequences. The amendment drove the lucrative alcohol business underground, giving rise to a large and pervasive black market. In addition, prohibition encouraged disrespect for the law and strengthened organized crime. Prohibition came to an end in 1933, when this amendment was repealed.\nThe Twenty-first Amendment (1933) repealed the Eighteenth Amendment and returned the regulation of alcohol to the states. Each state sets its own rules for the sale and importation of alcohol, including the drinking age. Because a federal law provides federal funds to states that prohibit the sale of alcohol to minors under the age of twenty-one, all fifty states have set their drinking age there. Rules about how alcohol is sold vary greatly from state to state.\nNineteenth Amendment (1920).\nThe Nineteenth Amendment prohibits the government from denying women the right to vote on the same terms as men. Prior to the amendment's adoption, only a few states permitted women to vote and to hold office.\nTwentieth Amendment (1933).\nThe Twentieth Amendment changes the date on which a new president, vice president and Congress take office, thus shortening the time between Election Day and the beginning of presidential, vice presidential and congressional terms. Originally, the Constitution provided that the annual meeting was to be on the first Monday in December unless otherwise provided by law. This meant that, when a new Congress was elected in November, it did not come into office until the following March, with a \"lame duck\" Congress convening in the interim. By moving the beginning of the president's new term from March 4 to January 20 (and in the case of Congress, to January 3), proponents hoped to put an end to lame duck sessions, while allowing for a speedier transition for the new administration and legislators.\nTwenty-second Amendment (1951).\nThe Twenty-second Amendment limits an elected president to two terms in office, a total of eight years. However, under some circumstances it is possible for an individual to serve more than eight years. Although nothing in the original frame of government limited how many presidential terms one could serve, the nation's first president, George Washington, declined to run for a third term, suggesting that two terms of four years were enough for any president. This precedent remained an unwritten rule of the presidency until broken by Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was elected to a third term as president 1940 and in 1944 to a fourth.\nTwenty-third Amendment (1961).\nThe Twenty-third Amendment extends the right to vote in presidential elections to citizens residing in the District of Columbia by granting the District electors in the Electoral College, as if it were a state. When first established as the nation's capital in 1800, the District of Columbia's five thousand residents had neither a local government, nor the right to vote in federal elections. By 1960 the population of the District had grown to over 760,000.\nTwenty-fourth Amendment (1964).\nThe Twenty-fourth Amendment prohibits a poll tax for voting. Although passage of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments helped remove many of the discriminatory laws left over from slavery, they did not eliminate all forms of discrimination. Along with literacy tests and durational residency requirements, poll taxes were used to keep low-income (primarily African American) citizens from participating in elections. The Supreme Court has since struck down these discriminatory measures.\nTwenty-fifth Amendment (1967).\nThe Twenty-fifth Amendment clarifies what happens upon the death, removal, or resignation of the president or vice president and how the presidency is temporarily filled if the president becomes disabled and cannot fulfill the responsibilities of the office. It supersedes the ambiguous succession rule established in . A concrete plan of succession has been needed on multiple occasions since 1789. However, for nearly 20% of U.S. history, there has been no vice president in office who could assume the presidency.\nTwenty-sixth Amendment (1971).\nThe Twenty-sixth Amendment prohibits the government from denying the right of United States citizens, eighteen years of age or older, to vote on account of age. The drive to lower the voting age was driven in large part by the broader student activism movement protesting the Vietnam War. It gained strength following the Supreme Court's decision in \"Oregon v. Mitchell\" (1970).\nTwenty-seventh Amendment (1992).\nThe Twenty-seventh Amendment (1992) prevents members of Congress from granting themselves pay raises during the current session. Rather, any raises that are adopted must take effect during the next session of Congress. Its proponents believed that Federal legislators would be more likely to be cautious about increasing congressional pay if they have no personal stake in the vote. has been affected by this amendment, which remained pending for over two centuries as it contained no time limit for ratification.\nUnratified amendments.\nCollectively, members of the House and Senate propose around 150 amendments during each two-year term of Congress. Most however, never get out of the Congressional committees in which they are proposed, and only a fraction of those approved in committee receive sufficient support to win Congressional approval and actually enter the constitutional ratification process.\nSix amendments approved by Congress and proposed to the states for consideration have not been ratified by the required number of states to become part of the Constitution. Four of these are technically still pending, as Congress did not set a time limit for their ratification. The other two are no longer pending, as both had a time limit attached and in both cases the time period set for their ratification expired.\nJudicial review.\nScope and theory.\nCourts established by the Constitution can regulate government under the Constitution, the supreme law of the land. First, they have jurisdiction over actions by an officer of government and state law. Second, federal courts may rule on whether coordinate branches of national government conform to the Constitution. Until the twentieth century, the Supreme Court of the United States may have been the only high tribunal in the world to use a court for constitutional interpretation of fundamental law, others generally depending on their national legislature.\nThe basic theory of American judicial review is summarized by constitutional legal scholars and historians as follows: the written Constitution is fundamental law within the states. It can change only by extraordinary legislative process of national proposal, then state ratification. The powers of all departments are limited to enumerated grants found in the Constitution. Courts are expected (a) to enforce provisions of the Constitution as the supreme law of the land, and (b) to refuse to enforce anything in conflict with it. Judicial review relies on the jurisdictional authority in Article III, and the Supremacy Clause.\nCase law.\nBarron v. Baltimore (1833).\nWhen John Marshall followed Oliver Ellsworth as chief justice of the Supreme Court in 1801, the federal judiciary had been established by the Judiciary Act, but there were few cases. Review of state legislation and appeals from state supreme courts was understood. But the Court's jurisdiction over state legislation was limited. The Marshall Court's landmark \"Barron v. Baltimore\" held that the Bill of Rights restricted only the federal government, and not the states.\nMarbury v. Madison (1803).\nIn the landmark \"Marbury v. Madison\" case, the Supreme Court asserted its authority of judicial review over Acts of Congress. Its findings were that Marbury and the others had a right to their commissions as judges in the District of Columbia. Marshall, writing the opinion for the majority, announced his discovered conflict between Section 13 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 and Article III. In this case, both the Constitution and the statutory law applied to the particulars at the same time. \"The very essence of judicial duty\" according to Marshall was to determine which of the two conflicting rules should govern. The Constitution enumerates powers of the judiciary to extend to cases arising \"under the Constitution\". Further, justices take a Constitutional oath to uphold it as \"Supreme law of the land.\" Therefore, since the United States government as created by the Constitution is a limited government, the federal courts were required to choose the Constitution over congressional law if there were deemed to be a conflict. \"This argument has been ratified by time and by practice...\" \nDred Scott (1857).\nThe Supreme Court did not declare another act of Congress unconstitutional until the controversial Dred Scott decision in 1857, held after the voided Missouri Compromise statute had already been repealed. In the eighty years following the Civil War to World War II, the Court voided congressional statutes in 77 cases, on average almost one a year.\nChase Court (1864 \u2013 1873).\nSalmon P. Chase was a Lincoln appointee, serving as chief justice from 1864 to 1873. In one of his first official acts, Chase admitted John Rock, the first African American to practice before the Supreme Court. The Chase Court is famous for \"Texas v. White\", which asserted a permanent Union of indestructible states. \"Veazie Bank v. Fenno\" upheld the Civil War tax on state banknotes. \"Hepburn v. Griswold\" found parts of the Legal Tender Acts unconstitutional, though it was reversed under a late Supreme Court majority.\nCivil Rights Cases (1883).\nThe \"Civil Rights Cases\", 109 U.S. 3 (1883), were a group of five landmark cases in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments did not empower Congress to outlaw racial discrimination by private individuals. The holding that the Thirteenth Amendment did not empower the federal government to punish racist acts done by private citizens would be overturned by the Supreme Court in the 1968 case \"Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.\"The Fourteenth Amendment not applying to private entities, however, is still valid precedent to this day. Although the Fourteenth Amendment-related decision has never been overturned, in the 1964 case of \"Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States\", the Supreme Court held that Congress could prohibit racial discrimination by private actors under the Commerce Clause.\nTaft Court (1921 \u2013 1930).\nAs chief justice, William Taft advocated for the Judiciary Act of 1925 that brought the Federal District Courts under the administrative jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. In 1925, the Taft Court issued a ruling overturning a Marshall Court ruling on the Bill of Rights. In \"Gitlow v. New York\", the Court established the doctrine of \"incorporation\", which applied the Bill of Rights to the states. Important cases included the \"Board of Trade of City of Chicago v. Olsen\", which upheld Congressional regulation of commerce; \"Olmstead v. United States\", which allowed exclusion of evidence obtained without a warrant based on application of the 14th Amendment proscription against unreasonable searches; and \"Wisconsin v. Illinois\", which ruled the equitable power of the United States can impose positive action on a state to prevent its inaction from damaging another state.\nNew Deal (1935 \u2013 1936).\nA crisis arose when, in 1935 and 1936, the Supreme Court handed down twelve decisions voiding acts of Congress relating to the New Deal. President Franklin D. Roosevelt then responded with his abortive \"court packing plan\". Other proposals have suggested a Court super-majority to overturn Congressional legislation, or a constitutional amendment to require that the justices retire at a specified age by law. To date, the Supreme Court's power of judicial review has persisted.\nWarren Court (1953 \u2013 1969).\nEarl Warren was an Eisenhower nominee, chief justice from 1953 to 1969. In 1954, the Warren Court overturned a landmark Fuller Court ruling on the Fourteenth Amendment interpreting racial segregation as permissible in government and commerce providing \"separate but equal\" services. Warren built a coalition of justices after 1962 that developed the idea of natural rights as guaranteed in the Constitution. \"Brown v. Board of Education\" banned segregation in public schools. \"Baker v. Carr\" and \"Reynolds v. Sims\" established Court ordered \"one-man-one-vote\". Bill of Rights Amendments were incorporated into the states. Due process was expanded in \"Gideon v. Wainwright\" and \"Miranda v. Arizona.\" First Amendment rights were addressed in \"Griswold v. Connecticut\" concerning privacy, and \"Engel v. Vitale\" relative to free speech.\nBurger Court (1969 \u2013 1986).\nWarren E Burger was appointed by Richard Nixon. Under his tenure, the Court decided the landmark cases of \"Roe v. Wade\" and \"Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education.\"\nRehnquist Court (1986 \u2013 2005).\nWilliam Rehnquist was a Reagan-appointed chief justice, serving from 1986 to 2005. While he would concur with overthrowing a state supreme court's decision, as in \"Bush v. Gore\", he built a coalition of Justices after 1994 that developed the idea of federalism as provided for in the Tenth Amendment. In the hands of the Supreme Court, the Constitution and its amendments were to restrain Congress, as in \"City of Boerne v. Flores\". Nevertheless, the Rehnquist Court was noted in the contemporary \"culture wars\" for overturning state laws relating to privacy, prohibiting late-term abortions in \"Stenberg v. Carhart\", prohibiting sodomy in \"Lawrence v. Texas\", or ruling so as to protect free speech in \"Texas v. Johnson\" or affirmative action in \"Grutter v. Bollinger\".\nRoberts Court (2005 \u2013 Present).\nJohn Roberts was appointed Chief Justice in 2005.\nPrinciples.\nJudicial restraint.\nThe Supreme Court has developed a system of doctrine and practice that limits its own power of judicial review. The Court controls almost all of its business by choosing what cases to consider, limiting decisions by defining what is a \"justiciable question\". The Court requires a personal interest, not one generally held, and a legally protected right must be immediately threatened by government action. Cases are not taken up if the litigant has no standing to sue. The Court also generally refuses to make any advisory opinions in advance of actual cases. Further, friendly suits between those of the same legal interest are not considered. \nThe procedural ways by which the Court dismisses cases have led critics to charge that the Supreme Court delays decisions by unduly insisting on technicalities in their \"standards of litigability\". They say cases are left unconsidered which are in the public interest, with genuine controversy, and resulting from good faith action.\nSeparation of powers.\nThe Supreme Court balances several pressures to maintain its roles in national government. It seeks to be a co-equal branch of government, but its decrees must be enforceable. The Court seeks to minimize situations where it asserts itself superior to either president or Congress, but federal officers must be held accountable. The Supreme Court assumes power to declare acts of Congress as unconstitutional but it self-limits its passing on constitutional questions. But the Court's guidance on basic problems of life and governance in a democracy is most effective when American political life reinforces its rulings.\nJustice Brandeis summarized four general guidelines that the Supreme Court uses to avoid constitutional decisions relating to Congress: The Court will not anticipate a question of constitutional law nor decide open questions unless a case decision requires it. If it does, a rule of constitutional law is formulated only as the precise facts in the case require. The Court will choose statutes or general law for the basis of its decision if it can without constitutional grounds. If it does, the Court will choose a constitutional construction of an act of Congress, even if its constitutionality is seriously in doubt.\nLikewise with the executive department, Edwin Corwin observed that the Court does sometimes rebuff presidential pretensions, but it more often tries to rationalize them. Against Congress, an act is merely \"disallowed\". In the executive case, exercising judicial review produces \"some change in the external world\" beyond the ordinary judicial sphere. The \"political question\" doctrine especially applies to questions which present a difficult enforcement issue. Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes addressed the Court's limitation when political process allowed future policy change, but a judicial ruling would \"attribute finality\". Political questions lack \"satisfactory criteria for a judicial determination.\"\nJohn Marshall recognized that the president holds \"important political powers\" which as executive privilege allows great discretion. This doctrine was applied in Court rulings on President Grant's duty to enforce the law during Reconstruction. It extends to the sphere of foreign affairs. Justice Robert Jackson explained, foreign affairs are inherently political, \"wholly confided by our Constitution to the political departments of the government\u00a0... [and] not subject to judicial intrusion or inquiry\".\nCritics of the Court object in two principal ways to self-restraint in judicial review, deferring as it does as a matter of doctrine to acts of Congress and presidential actions. Its inaction is said to allow \"a flood of legislative appropriations\" which permanently create an imbalance between the states and federal government. It has also been argued that the Supreme Court's deference to Congress and the executive compromises American protection of civil rights, political minority groups and aliens.\nIn anthropology and sociology.\nThere is a viewpoint that some Americans have come to see the documents of the Constitution, along with the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights, as being a cornerstone of a type of civil religion. Some commentators depict the multi-ethnic, multi-sectarian United States as held together by political orthodoxy, in contrast with a nation-state of people having more \"natural\" ties.\nWorldwide influence.\nThe United States Constitution has been a notable model for governance worldwide, especially through the 1970s. Its international influence is found in similarities in phrasing and borrowed passages in other constitutions, as well as in the principles of the rule of law, separation of powers, and recognition of individual rights.\nThe American experience of fundamental law with amendments and judicial review has motivated constitutionalists at times when they were considering the possibilities for their nation's future. It informed Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War, his contemporary and ally Benito Ju\u00e1rez of Mexico, and the second generation of 19th-century constitutional nationalists, Jos\u00e9 Rizal of the Philippines and Sun Yat-sen of China. The framers of the Australian constitution integrated federal ideas from the U.S. and other constitutions.\nSince the 1980s, the influence of the United States Constitution has been waning as other countries have created new constitutions or updated older constitutions, a process which Sanford Levinson believes to be more difficult in the United States than in any other country.\nCriticism.\nThe United States Constitution has faced various criticisms since its inception in 1787.\nThe Constitution did not originally define who was eligible to vote, allowing each state to determine who was eligible. In the early history of the U.S., most states allowed only white male adult property owners to vote; the notable exception was New Jersey, where women were able to vote on the same basis as men. Until the Reconstruction Amendments were adopted between 1865 and 1870, the five years immediately following the American Civil War, the Constitution did not abolish slavery, nor give citizenship and voting rights to former slaves. These amendments did not include a specific prohibition on discrimination in voting on the basis of sex; it took another amendment\u2014the Nineteenth, ratified in 1920\u2014for the Constitution to prohibit any United States citizen from being denied the right to vote on the basis of sex.\nAccording to a 2012 study by David Law and Mila Versteeg published in the \"New York University Law Review\", the U.S. Constitution guarantees relatively few rights compared to the constitutions of other countries and contains fewer than half (26 of 60) of the provisions listed in the average bill of rights. It is also one of the few in the world today that still features the right to keep and bear arms; the other two being the constitutions of Guatemala and Mexico.\nSanford Levinson wrote in 2006 that it has been the most difficult constitution in the world to amend since the fall of Yugoslavia. Levitsky and Ziblatt argue that the US Constitution is the most difficult in the world to amend, and that this helps explain why the US still has so many undemocratic institutions that most or all other democracies have reformed, directly allowing significant democratic backsliding in the United States.\nCommemorations.\nIn 1937, the U.S. Post Office, at the prompting of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, an avid stamp collector himself, released a commemorative postage stamp celebrating the 150th anniversary of the signing of the U.S. Constitution. The engraving on this issue is after an by Junius Brutus Stearns of Washington and shows delegates signing the Constitution at the 1787 Convention. The following year another commemorative stamp was issued celebrating the 150th anniversary of the ratification of the Constitution. In 1987 the U.S. Government minted a 1987 silver dollar in celebration of the 200th anniversary of the signing of the Constitution.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nRelated documents.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "31646", "revid": "49584795", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31646", "title": "Article One of the United States Constitution", "text": "Portions of the US Constitution regarding Congress' structure and powers\nArticle One of the Constitution of the United States establishes the legislative branch of the federal government, the United States Congress. Under Article One, Congress is a bicameral legislature consisting of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Article One grants Congress enumerated powers and the ability to pass laws \"necessary and proper\" to carry out those powers. Article One also establishes the procedures for passing a bill and places limits on the powers of Congress and the states from abusing their powers.\nArticle One's Vesting Clause grants all federal legislative power to Congress and establishes that Congress consists of the House of Representatives and the Senate. In combination with the vesting clauses of Article Two and Article Three, the Vesting Clause of Article One establishes the separation of powers among the three branches of the federal government. Section 2 of Article One addresses the House of Representatives, establishing that members of the House are elected every two years, with congressional seats apportioned to the states on the basis of population. Section 2 includes rules for the House of Representatives, including a provision stating that individuals qualified to vote in elections for the largest chamber of their state's legislature have the right to vote in elections for the House of Representatives. Section 3 addresses the Senate, establishing that the Senate consists of two senators from each state, with each senator serving a six-year term. Section 3 originally required that the state legislatures elect the members of the Senate, but the Seventeenth Amendment, ratified in 1913, provides for the direct election of senators. Section 3 lays out other rules for the Senate, including a provision that establishes the vice president of the United States as the president of the Senate.\nSection 4 of Article One grants the states the power to regulate the congressional election process, but establishes that Congress can alter those regulations or make its own regulations. Section 4 also requires Congress to assemble at least once per year. Section 5 lays out rules for both houses of Congress and grants the House of Representatives and the Senate the power to judge their own elections, determine the qualifications of their own members, and punish or expel their own members. Section 6 establishes the compensation, privileges, and restrictions of those holding congressional office. Section 7 lays out the procedures for passing a bill, requiring both houses of Congress to pass a bill for it to become law, subject to the veto power of the president of the United States. Under Section 7, the president can veto a bill, but Congress can override the president's veto with a two-thirds vote of both chambers.\nSection 8 lays out the powers of Congress. It includes several enumerated powers, including the power to lay and collect \"taxes, duties, imposts, and excises\" (provided duties, imposts, and excises are uniform throughout the United States), \"to provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States\", the power to regulate interstate and international commerce, the power to set naturalization laws, the power to coin and regulate money, the power to borrow money on the credit of the United States, the power to establish post offices and post roads, the power to establish federal courts inferior to the Supreme Court, the power to raise and support an army and a navy, the power to call forth the militia \"to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions\" and to provide for the militia's \"organizing, arming, disciplining\u00a0... and governing\" and granting Congress the power to declare war. Section 8 also provides Congress with the power to establish a federal district to serve as the national capital and gives Congress the exclusive power to administer that district. In addition to its enumerated powers, Section 8 grants Congress the power to make laws necessary and proper to carry out its enumerated powers and other powers vested in it. Section 9 places limits on the power of Congress, banning bills of attainder and other practices. Section 10 places limits on the states, prohibiting them from entering into alliances with foreign powers, impairing contracts, taxing imports or exports above the minimum level necessary for inspection, keeping armies, or engaging in war without the consent of Congress.\nSection 1: Legislative power vested in Congress.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.\nSection 1 is a vesting clause that bestows federal legislative power to Congress. Similar clauses are found in Article II, which confers executive power upon the president, and Article III, which grants judicial power to the federal judiciary. These three articles create a separation of powers among the three branches of the federal government. This separation of powers, interpreted by the federal courts as permitting each branch to exercise its own constitutional powers and no others, is fundamental to the idea of a limited government accountable to the people.\nThe separation of powers principle is particularly significant for Congress. The Constitution declares that Congress may exercise only those legislative powers \"herein granted\" within Article I (as later limited by the Tenth Amendment). It also, by implied extension, had been interpreted as prohibiting Congress from delegating its legislative authority to either of the other branches of government, a rule known as the nondelegation doctrine. However, the Supreme Court has ruled that Congress does have the latitude to delegate regulatory powers to executive agencies as long as it provides an \"intelligible principle\" which governs the agency's exercise of the delegated regulatory authority. That the power assigned to each branch must remain with that branch, and may be expressed only by that branch, is central to the theory. The nondelegation doctrine is primarily used as a way of interpreting a congressional delegation of authority narrowly, in that the courts presume Congress intended only to delegate that which it certainly could have, unless it clearly demonstrates it intended to \"test the waters\" of what the courts would allow it to do.\nAlthough not mentioned in the Constitution, Congress has also long asserted the power to investigate and the power to compel cooperation with an investigation. The Supreme Court has affirmed these powers as an implication of Congress's power to legislate. Since the power to investigate is asserted to be an aspect of Congress's power to legislate, it has been ruled to be as broad as Congress's powers to legislate. However, it has also been limited to inquiries that are \"in aid of the legislative function\";The Supreme Court has stated that Congress may not \"expose for the sake of exposure\". It is uncontroversial that a proper subject of Congress's investigation power is the operations of the federal government, but Congress's ability to compel the submission of documents or testimony from the president or his subordinates is often-discussed and sometimes controversial (see executive privilege), although not often litigated. As a practical matter, the limitation of Congress's ability to investigate only for a proper purpose (\"in aid of\" its legislative powers) functions as a limit on Congress's ability to investigate the private affairs of individual citizens; the Supreme Court has ruled that matters which the courts determine simply demand action by another branch of government, without implicating an issue of public policy necessitating legislation by Congress, must be left to those branches, due to the doctrine of separation of powers. The courts have been highly deferential to Congress's exercise of its investigation powers, however. Congress has the power to investigate that which it could regulate, and the courts have interpreted Congress's regulatory powers broadly since the Great Depression.\nSection 2: House of Representatives.\nClause 1: Composition and election of Members.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States, and the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature.\nElection districts in each state have recently been required to be structured so that each elected representative represents substantially equal populations, based on court interpretations of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, finding that, \"construed in its historical context, the command of Art. I, \u00a7 2, that Representatives be chosen 'by the People of the several States' means that as nearly as is practicable one man's vote in a congressional election is to be worth as much as another's.\" Court involvement in this issue developed slowly from an initial practice of electing representatives at-large, until in the late 1940s and the early 1950s the Court used the \"political question\" doctrine in \"Baker v. Carr\" to decline to adjudicate districting and apportionment suits. The Supreme Court has held in \"Rucho v. Common Cause\" that there was no \"constitutional directive\" nor any \"legal standards to guide\" the Court in claims of unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering, and such claims today are considered nonjusticiable.\nAt the time of its creation, the Constitution did not explicitly give citizens an inherent right to vote. However, by stipulating that those qualified to vote in elections for the largest chamber of a state's legislature could vote in congressional (House of Representatives) elections the Framers expressed a rather explicit intent that the House was to be directly elected. Since the Civil War, several constitutional amendments have been enacted that have curbed the states' broad powers to set voter qualification standards. Though never enforced, clause 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that \"when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for president and vice president of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.\" The Fifteenth Amendment prohibits the denial of the right to vote based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude. The Nineteenth Amendment prohibits the denial of the right to vote based on sex. The Twenty-fourth Amendment prohibits the revocation of voting rights due to the non-payment of a poll tax. The Twenty-sixth Amendment prohibits the denial of the right of US citizens, eighteen years of age or older, to vote on account of age.\nMoreover, since the Supreme Court has recognized voting as a fundamental right, the Equal Protection Clause places very tight limitations (albeit with uncertain limits) on the states' ability to define voter qualifications; it is fair to say that qualifications beyond citizenship, residency, and age are usually questionable.\nIn the 1960s, the Supreme Court started to view voting as a fundamental right covered by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In a dissenting opinion of a 1964 Supreme Court case involving reapportionment in the Alabama state legislature, Associate Justice John Marshall Harlan II included \"Minor v. Happersett\" (an 1875 case which allowed states to deny women the right to vote) in a list of past decisions about voting and apportionment which were no longer being followed.\nIn \"Oregon v. Mitchell\" (1970), the Supreme Court held that the Qualifications clause did not prevent Congress from overriding state-imposed minimum age restrictions for voters in Congressional elections.\nSince provides that members of the House of Representatives are apportioned state-by-state and that each state is guaranteed at least one representative, exact population equality between all districts is not guaranteed and, in fact, is currently impossible, because while the size of the House of Representatives is fixed at 435, several states had less than 1/435 of the national population at the time of the last reapportionment in 2020. However, the Supreme Court has interpreted the provision of Clause One that representatives shall be elected \"by the People\" to mean that, in those states with more than one member of the House of Representatives, each congressional election district within the state must have nearly identical populations.\nClause 2: Qualifications of Members.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;No Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the Age of twenty five Years, and been seven Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen.\nThe Constitution provides three requirements for representatives: A representative must be at least 25 years old, must be an inhabitant of the state in which he or she is elected, and must have been a citizen of the United States for the previous seven years. There is no requirement that a representative reside within the district in which he or she represents, as there is no constitutional requirement on how representatives are elected. Although representatives usually live in the district that they represent, there have been occasional exceptions.\nThe Supreme Court has interpreted the Qualifications Clause as an \"exclusive\" list of qualifications that cannot be supplemented by a house of Congress exercising its authority to \"judge...the...qualifications of its own members\" or by a state in its exercise of its authority to prescribe the \"times, places and manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives.\" The Supreme Court, as well as other federal courts, have repeatedly barred states from additional restrictions, such as imposing term limits on members of Congress, allowing members of Congress to be subject to recall elections, or requiring that representatives live in the congressional district in which they represent. A 2002 Congressional Research Service report also found that no state could implement a qualification that a representative not be a convicted felon or incarcerated.\nHowever, the United States Supreme Court has ruled that certain ballot access requirements, such as filing fees and submitting a certain number of valid petition signatures do not constitute additional qualifications and thus few Constitutional restrictions exist as to how harsh ballot access laws can be.\nFinally, although the U.S. Constitution places no restrictions on state or local office-holders simultaneously holding federal office, most state constitutions today effectively ban state and local office holders from also holding federal office at the same time by prohibiting federal office holders from also holding state and local office. Unlike other state-mandated restrictions, these sorts of prohibitions are constitutional as long they are enforced purely at the state level (i.e. against active federal office holders seeking to obtain or hold a state or local office).\nClause 3: Apportionment of Representatives and taxes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons. The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct. The number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty Thousand, but each State shall have at Least one Representative; and until such enumeration shall be made, the State of New Hampshire shall be entitled to chuse [\"sic\"] three, Massachusetts eight, Rhode-Island and Providence Plantations one, Connecticut five, New-York six, New Jersey four, Pennsylvania eight, Delaware one, Maryland six, Virginia ten, North Carolina five, South Carolina five, and Georgia three.\nAfter much debate, the framers of the Constitution decided to make population the basis of apportioning the seats in the House of Representatives and the tax liability among the states. To facilitate this, the Constitution mandates that a census be conducted every ten years to determine the population of each state and of the nation as a whole and establishes a rule for who shall be counted or excluded from the count. As the new form of government would become operational prior to the completion of a national census, the Constitution also provides for a temporary apportionment of seats.\nOriginally, the population of each state and of the nation as a whole was ascertained by adding to the whole number of free persons, three-fifths the number of all other persons (i.e. slaves), but excluding non-taxed Native Americans. This Constitutional rule, known as the three-fifths compromise, was a compromise between Southern and Northern states in which three-fifths of the population of slaves would be counted for enumeration purposes and for the apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives and of taxes among the states. It was, according to Supreme Court justice Joseph Story (writing in 1833), a \"matter of compromise and concession, confessedly unequal in its operation, but a necessary sacrifice to that spirit of conciliation, which was indispensable to the union of states having a great diversity of interests, and physical condition, and political institutions\". Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment (1868) later superseded Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3 and explicitly repealed the compromise.\nFollowing the completion of each census, Congress is empowered to use the aggregate population in all the states (according to the prevailing constitutional rule for determining population) to determine the relative population of each state to the population of the whole, and, based on its calculations, to establish the appropriate size of the House and to allocate a particular number of representatives to each state according to its share of the national population.\nSince enactment of the Reapportionment Act of 1929, a constant 435 House seats have been apportioned among the states according to each census, and determining the size of the House is not presently part of the apportionment process. With one exception, the apportionment of 1842, the House of Representatives had been enlarged by various degrees from sixty-five members in 1788 to 435 members by 1913. The determination of size was made based on the aggregate national population, so long as the size of the House did not exceed 1 member for every 30,000 of the country's total population nor the size of any state's delegation exceed 1 for every 30,000 of that state's population. With the size of the House still fixed at 435, the current ratio, as of the 2020 United States census, is around 1 representative per 760,000 persons.\nHowever, after the 1920 census, Congress failed to apportion the House, with the House using the allocations of the Apportionment Act of 1911 until after the 1932 elections, which was the date determined by Congress after it passed and the president signed the Reapportionment Act of 1929. This resulted in the representation within the House to remain frozen for twenty years. Reapportionment of the House required Congress to pass a bill and the president to sign into law an act to reapportion the House from since the ratification of the constitution up until 1941, which is when a self-executing statute was enacted, thus making reapportionment an automatic process.\nAlthough the first sentence in this clause originally concerned apportionment of both House seats and taxes among the several states, the Fourteenth Amendment sentence that replaced it in 1868 mentioned only the apportionment of House seats. Even so, the constraint placed upon Congress's taxation power remained, as the restriction was reiterated in Article 1 Section 9 Clause 4. The amount of direct taxes that could be collected by the federal government from the people in any State would still be tied directly to that state's share of the national population.\nDue to this restriction, application of the income tax to income derived from real estate and specifically income in the form of dividends from personal property ownership such as stock shares was found to be unconstitutional because it was not apportioned among the states; that is to say, there was no guarantee that a State with 10% of the country's population paid 10% of those income taxes collected, because Congress had not fixed an amount of money to be raised and apportioned it between the States according to their respective shares of the national population. To permit the levying of such an income tax, Congress proposed and the states ratified the Sixteenth Amendment, which removed the restriction by specifically providing that Congress could levy a tax on income \"from whatever source derived\" without it being apportioned among the States or otherwise based on a State's share of the national population.\nClause 4: Vacancies.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When vacancies happen in the Representation from any State, the Executive Authority thereof shall issue Writs of Election to fill such Vacancies.\nGenerally states and territories fill vacancies within the House of Representatives according to their own laws, however when vacancies within the House exceed 100 members, the speaker of the House will announce \"extraordinary circumstances\" have occurred, which obligates the executive authority of all states with vacancies to hold a special election within 49 days of the announcement. This election is initiated via a writ of election from the governor (\u00a0https://).\nClause 5: Speaker and other officers; Impeachment.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The House of Representatives shall chuse [\"sic\"] their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.\nSection Two further provides that the House of Representatives \"shall\" choose its speaker and its other officers. Though the Constitution does not mandate it, every speaker has been a member of the House of Representatives. The Speaker rarely presides over routine House sessions, choosing instead to deputize a junior member to accomplish the task.\nFinally, Section Two grants to the House of Representatives the sole power of impeachment. Although the Supreme Court has not had an occasion to interpret this specific provision, the Court has suggested that the grant to the House of the \"sole\" power of impeachment makes the House the exclusive interpreter of what constitutes an impeachable offense.\nThis power, which is analogous to the bringing of criminal charges by a grand jury, has been used only rarely. The House has begun impeachment proceedings 62 times since 1789, and twenty-one federal officials have been formally impeached as a result, including: three presidents (Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump, twice), two Cabinet secretaries (William W. Belknap and Alejandro Mayorkas), one senator (William Blount), one Supreme Court associate justice (Samuel Chase), and fourteen federal judges. Also, notably, impeachment proceedings compelled the resignation of President Richard Nixon.\nThe Constitution does not specify how impeachment proceedings are to be initiated. Until the early 20th century, a House member could rise and propose an impeachment, which would then be assigned to a committee for investigation upon a formal resolution vote of the judicial committee. Presently, it is the House Judiciary Committee that initiates the process and then, after investigating the allegations, prepares recommendations for the whole House's consideration. If the House votes to adopt an impeachment resolution, \"managers\" are appointed by the House to serve as the prosecution team in the impeachment trial in the Senate (see Section 3, Clause 6 below).\nSection 3: Senate.\nClause 1: Composition and election of senators.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, chosen by the Legislature thereof, for six Years; and each Senator shall have one Vote.\nThe first Clause of Section Three provides that each state is entitled to have two senators, who would be \"elected by its state legislature\" (now by the people of each state), serve for staggered six-year terms, and have one vote each. Through these provisions, adopted following the Connecticut Compromise, the Framers sought to protect the sovereignty and interests of states. This clause has been superseded by the Seventeenth Amendment, ratified in 1913, which, in part, provides \"as amended\", that\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, elected by the people thereof, for six years; and each Senator shall have one vote.\nArticle Five specifies the means by which the Constitution of the United States can be amended. It ends by shielding three Article I clauses from being amended. The clause guaranteeing equal representation is among them. (The others are first and fourth clauses in Section 9, which were amendable after 1808.) Article Five provides that \"no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate.\" Thus, no individual state may have its individual representation in the Senate adjusted without its consent. That is to say, an amendment that directly changed this clause to provide that all states would get only one senator (or three senators, or any other number) could become valid as part of the Constitution if ratified by three-fourths of the states; however, one that provided for some basis of representation other than strict numerical equality (for example, population, wealth, or land area), would require the unanimous consent of all the states.\nDenying the states their intended role as joint partners in the federal government by abolishing their equality in the Senate would, according to Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase (in \"Texas v. White\"), destroy the grounding of the Union. This Article V provision has been employed by those opposed to contemplated constitutional amendments that would grant the District of Columbia full representation in Congress without also granting it statehood. Their argument is that an amendment that would allow a non-state district to have two senators would deprive the states of their equal suffrage in the Senate and would therefore require unanimous ratification by all the states. Those in favor of the amendment have argued that the states are merely entitled to equal suffrage amongst one another, and that granting the federal district Senate representation does not violate that right. Whether unanimous consent of the 50 states would be required for such an amendment to become operative remains an unanswered political question.\nClause 2: Classification of senators; Vacancies.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Immediately after they shall be assembled in Consequence of the first Election, they shall be divided as equally as may be into three Classes. The Seats of the Senators of the first Class shall be vacated at the Expiration of the second Year, of the second Class at the Expiration of the fourth Year, and of the third Class at the Expiration of the sixth Year, so that one third may be chosen every second Year; and if Vacancies happen by Resignation, or otherwise, during the Recess of the Legislature of any State, the Executive thereof may make temporary Appointments until the next Meeting of the Legislature, which shall then fill such Vacancies.\nAfter the first group of senators was elected to the First Congress (1789\u20131791), the senators were divided into three \"classes\" as nearly equal in size as possible, as required by this section. This was done in May 1789 by lot. It was also decided that each state's senators would be assigned to two different classes. Those senators grouped in the first class had their term expire after only two years; those senators in the second class had their term expire after only four years, instead of six. After this, all senators from those states have been elected to six-year terms, and as new states have joined the Union, their Senate seats have been assigned to two of the three classes, maintaining each grouping as nearly equal in size as possible. In this way, election is staggered; approximately one-third of the Senate is up for re-election every two years, but the entire body is never up for re-election in the same year (as contrasted with the House, where its entire membership is up for re-election every 2 years).\nAs originally established, senators were elected by the Legislature of the State they represented in the Senate. If a senator died, resigned, or was expelled, the legislature of the state would appoint a replacement to serve out the remainder of the senator's term. If the state legislature was not in session, its governor could appoint a temporary replacement to serve until the legislature could elect a permanent replacement. This was superseded by the Seventeenth Amendment, which provided for the popular election of senators, instead of their appointment by the state legislature. In a nod to the less populist nature of the Senate, the amendment tracks the vacancy procedures for the House of Representatives in requiring that the governor call a special election to fill the vacancy, but (unlike in the House) it vests in the state legislature the authority to allow the governor to appoint a temporary replacement until the special election is held. Note, however, that under the original Constitution, the governors of the states were expressly allowed by the Constitution to make temporary appointments. The current system, under the Seventeenth Amendment, allows governors to appoint a replacement only if their state legislature has previously decided to allow the governor to do so; otherwise, the seat must remain vacant until the special election is held to fill the seat, as in the case of a vacancy in the House.\nClause 3: Qualifications of senators.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;No Person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty Years, and been nine Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State for which he shall be chosen.\nA senator must be at least 30 years of age, must have been a citizen of the United States for at least nine years before being elected, and must reside in the State they will represent at the time of the election. The Supreme Court has interpreted the Qualifications Clause as an exclusive list of qualifications that cannot be supplemented by a House of Congress exercising its authority to \"Judge\u00a0... the\u00a0... Qualifications of its own Members\", or by a state in its exercise of its authority to prescribe the \"Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives\".\nClause 4: Vice president as president of Senate.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate, but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally divided.\nSection Three provides that the vice president is the president of the Senate. Excepting the duty to receive the tally of electoral votes for president, this is the only regular responsibility assigned to the office of the vice president by the Constitution. When serving in this capacity, the vice president may cast tie-breaking votes. Early in the nation's history, vice presidents frequently presided over the Senate. In modern times, the vice president usually does so only during ceremonial occasions or when a tie in the voting is anticipated. As of \u00a0, 2022[ [update]], there have been 294 tie-breaking votes cast by vice presidents.\nClause 5: President pro tempore and other officers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Senate shall chuse [\"sic\"] their other Officers, and also a President pro tempore, in the Absence of the Vice President, or when he shall exercise the Office of the President of the United States.\nClause five provides for a president pro tempore of the Senate, who is elected to the post by the Senate, to preside over the body when the vice president is either absent or exercising the powers and duties of the president.\nAlthough the constitutional text seems to suggest to the contrary, the Senate's current practice is to elect a full-time president pro tempore at the beginning of each Congress, as opposed to making it a temporary office only existing during the vice president's absence. Historically, a member of the majority party has filled this position. The Constitution does not require that the president pro tempore be a senator, but by convention, a senator is always chosen. The same goes for the speaker of the House, who is not required to be a U.S. representative, but always has been.\nClause 6: Trial of impeachment.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.\nClause Six grants to the Senate the sole power to try impeachments and spells out the basic procedures for impeachment trials. The Supreme Court has interpreted this clause to mean that the Senate has exclusive and unreviewable authority to determine what constitutes an adequate impeachment trial. Of the twenty federal officials formally impeached (Donald Trump was impeached twice) by the House of Representatives, four resigned (so that proceedings were dismissed), eight were acquitted (Trump was acquitted twice), and eight (all judges) were convicted by the Senate. On another occasion, the Senate declined to proceed with the impeachment of Senator William Blount in 1797, asserting that the House had no jurisdiction over members of the Senate; in any case, Blount had already been expelled from the Senate.\nOn May 29, 1787, Virginia Constitutional Convention Delegate Edmund Randolph introduced fifteen resolutions to the Convention (following a plan formulated by fellow Virginia delegate James Madison) that included a proposal to have a national judiciary conduct impeachments of national officials and to replace the Congress of the Confederation with a bicameral legislature where members of the lower house directly elected by the public would select members of the upper house. On June 7, the Convention passed a resolution moving that senators would be chosen by their respective state legislatures rather than by popular vote. On September 4, a Committee of Eleven formed on August 31 submitted a resolution to the Convention that proposed that the Senate should have the power to try all impeachments.\nOn September 8, the convention approved the Senate impeachment trial jury resolution, and also approved a resolution introduced by Virginia delegate George Mason to expand the scope of impeachments to include \"other high crimes and misdemeanors\" instead of only treason and bribery. After the approval of the resolution, James Madison spoke in opposition to having the Senate serve as the impeachment trial jury rather than the Supreme Court and introduced a failed resolution to remove the power from the Senate, while Pennsylvania delegate Gouverneur Morris argued against having the Court conduct impeachments because the Court would be too small in number.\nAfter six states had ratified the Constitution, New York delegate Alexander Hamilton argued in \"Federalist No. 65\" on March 7, 1788, that because of the inherently political nature of impeachment\u2014as the process relates primarily to injuries to the body politic caused by the misconduct of public officials in violation of their public trust\u2014prosecuting such charges would typically divide the public into factions in defense of or in opposition to the accused, that such factions would often overlap with and reinforce existing partisan factions, and that this risked the decisions in impeachment trials not being based upon actual demonstrations of innocence or guilt but instead by the comparative strength of the factions. Thus, Hamilton concluded that \"A well-established court for the trial of impeachments is an object not more to be desired than difficult to be obtained in a government wholly elective.\"\nNoting that the model approved by the convention was modeled after the impeachment process in Great Britain and that the British model had been adopted by multiple state constitutions, Hamilton argued that the Senate, composed of members chosen by state legislatures rather than popularly elected by the public, was sufficiently independent to serve as an impartial trial jury of impeachments for accusations brought by the House of Representatives, composed of members directly elected by the public. By contrast, Hamilton doubted that impeachment trials conducted by the Supreme Court, composed of unelected lifetime appointees, would have the requisite legitimacy to adjudicate the indefinite and inexhaustible range of impeachable charges brought by the House of Representatives. Instead, Hamilton argued that because a court of impeachment renders verdicts on charges \"[that] can never be tied down by\u00a0... strict rules\u00a0... in the delineation of the offense by the prosecutors\" and that are leveled against the \"most distinguished characters of the community\", the inherently political nature of impeachment trials necessitated a numerous court and \"[forbade] the commitment of the trust to a small number of persons.\"\nAdditionally, Hamilton argued that because conviction in an impeachment trial did not preclude further criminal prosecution\u2014since impeachment would not require the accused to have committed an indictable offense and its punishment would be limited to removal and disqualification from holding public office\u2014having the Supreme Court conduct impeachment trials could subject impeached officials to double jeopardy, arguing \"Would it be proper that the persons who had disposed [impeached officials of their] fame\u00a0... in one trial, should, in another trial, for the same offense, be also the disposers of [their] life and\u00a0... fortune? Would there not be the greatest reason to apprehend, that error, in the first sentence, would be the parent of error in the second sentence? ... [By] making the same persons judges in both cases, [impeached officials] would\u00a0... be deprived of the double security intended them by a double trial.\"\nThere are three constitutionally mandated requirements for impeachment trials. The provision that senators must sit on oath or affirmation was designed to impress upon them the extreme seriousness of the occasion. The stipulation that the chief justice is to preside over presidential impeachment trials underscores the solemnity of the occasion, and aims to avoid the conflict of interest of a vice president's presiding over the proceeding for the removal of the one official standing between them and the presidency. The latter consideration was regarded to be quite important in the eighteenth century \u2013 political parties had not yet formed when the Constitution was adopted, and with the original method of electing the president and vice president it was presumed that the two people elected to those offices would frequently be political rivals. The specification that a two-thirds super-majority vote of those senators present in order to convict was also thought necessary to facilitate serious deliberation and to make removal possible only through a consensus that cuts across factional divisions.\nClause 7: Judgment in cases of impeachment; Punishment on conviction.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.\nIf any officer or the president or the vice president is convicted on impeachment, that person is immediately removed from office and may be barred from holding any appointed federal executive office in the future. This is purely a political remedy which \"touches neither his person, nor his property; but simply divests him of his political capacity,\" however the convicted person remains liable to trial and punishment in the courts for civil and criminal charges. The President cannot reinstate an impeached officer with his Article II appointment power if such officers have been disqualified to hold any future federal office as part of their conviction.\nSection 4: Congressional elections and sessions.\nClause 1: Time, place, and manner of holding elections.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing [\"sic\"] Senators.\nThe purpose of this clause is twofold. First, it makes clear the division of responsibility with respect to the conduct of the election of federal senators and representatives. That responsibility lies primarily with the states and secondarily with Congress. Second, the clause lodges the power to regulate elections in the respective legislative branches of the states and the federal government. As authorized by this clause, Congress has set a uniform date for federal elections: the Tuesday following the first Monday in November.\nPresently, as there are no on-point federal regulations, the states retain the authority to regulate the dates on which other aspects of the election process are held (registration, primary elections, etc.) and where elections will be held. As for regulating the \"manner\" of elections, the Supreme Court has interpreted this to mean \"matters like notices, registration, supervision of voting, protection of voters, prevention of fraud and corrupt practices, counting of votes, duties of inspectors and canvassers, and making and publication of election returns.\" The Supreme Court has held that States may \"not\" exercise their power to determine the \"manner\" of holding elections to impose term limits on their congressional delegation.\nOne of the most significant ways that each state regulates the \"manner\" of elections is through their power to draw electoral districts. Although in theory Congress could draw the district map for each State, it has not exercised this level of oversight. Congress has, however, required the States to conform to certain practices when drawing districts. States are currently required to use a single-member district scheme, whereby the State is divided into as many election districts for representatives in the House of Representatives as the size of its representation in that body (that is to say, representatives cannot be elected at-large from the whole state unless the state has only one representative in the House, nor can districts elect more than one representative). The Supreme Court has interpreted \"by the Legislature thereof\" to include the state governor's veto, and the initiative process, in those states whose constitutions provide it. This conclusion has been challenged, however, by the independent state legislature theory, which was rejected by the Supreme Court in their 2023 decision in \"Moore v. Harper\".\nCongress first exercised its power to regulate elections nationwide in 1842, when the 27th Congress passed a law requiring the election of representatives by districts. In subsequent years, Congress expanded on the requirements, successively adding contiguity, compactness, and substantial equality of population to the districting requirements. These standards were later not included in the Reapportionment Act of 1929, but the Supreme Court has re-imposed the population requirement on the States under the Equal Protection Clause and is suspicious of districts that do not meet the other \"traditional\" districting criteria of compactness and contiguity. The single member district requirement was reinforced in the Uniform Congressional District Act passed by Congress in 1967.\nIn 1865, Congress legislated a remedy for a situation under which deadlocks in state legislatures over the election of senators were creating vacancies in the office. The act required the two houses of each legislature to meet in joint session on a specified day and to meet every day thereafter until a senator was selected. The first comprehensive federal statute dealing with elections was adopted in 1870 as a means of enforcing the Fifteenth Amendment's guarantee against racial discrimination in granting suffrage rights. Under the Enforcement Act of 1870, and subsequent laws, false registration, bribery, voting without legal right, making false returns of votes cast, interference in any manner with officers of election, and the neglect by any such officer of any duty required by state or federal law were made federal offenses. Provision was made for the appointment by federal judges of persons to attend at places of registration and at elections with authority to challenge any person proposing to register or vote unlawfully, to witness the counting of votes, and to identify by their signatures the registration of voters and election tally sheets.\nBeginning with the Tillman Act of 1907, Congress has imposed a growing number of restrictions on elections and campaign financing. The most significant piece of legislation has been the 1971 Federal Election Campaign Act. It was this legislation that was at issue in the Supreme Court's seminal decision, \"Buckley v. Valeo\" (1976), which, in the face of a First Amendment challenge, set the ground rules for campaign finance legislation, generally disallowing restrictions on expenditures by candidates, but permitting restrictions on contributions by individuals and corporations.\nIn addition to statutory constraints, Congress and the states have altered the electoral process through amending the Constitution (first in the above mentioned Fifteenth Amendment). The Seventeenth Amendment altered the manner of conducting the elections of senators; establishing that they are to be elected by the people of the states. Also, the Nineteenth Amendment prohibits any U.S. citizen from being denied the right to vote on the basis of sex; the Twenty-fourth Amendment prohibits both Congress and the states from conditioning the right to vote in federal elections on payment of a poll tax or other types of tax; and the Twenty-sixth Amendment prohibits the states and the federal government from using age as a reason for denying the right to vote to U.S. citizens who are at least eighteen years old.\nClause 2: Sessions of Congress.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Congress shall assemble at least once in every Year, and such Meeting shall be on the first Monday in December, unless they shall by Law appoint a different Day.\nClause 2 fixes an annual date upon which Congress must meet. By doing so, the Constitution empowers Congress to meet, whether or not the president called it into session. does grant the president limited authority to convene and adjourn both Houses (or either of them) and mandates that it will meet at least once in a year to enact legislation on behalf of the people. Some delegates to the 1787 constitutional convention believed yearly meetings were not necessary, for there would not be enough legislative business for Congress to deal with annually. Nathaniel Gorham of Massachusetts argued that the time should be fixed to prevent disputes from arising within the legislature, and to allow the states to adjust their elections to correspond with the fixed date. A fixed date also corresponded to the tradition in the states of having annual meetings. Finally, Gorham concluded that the legislative branch should be required to meet at least once a year to act as a check upon the executive department.\nAlthough this clause provides that the annual meeting was to be on the first Monday in December, the government established by the 1787 Constitution did not begin operations until March 4, 1789. As the 1st Congress held its initial meeting on March 4, that became the date on which new representatives and senators took office in subsequent years. Therefore, every other year, although a new Congress was elected in November, it did not come into office until the following March, with a \"lame duck\" session convening in the interim. This practice was altered in 1933 following ratification of the Twentieth Amendment, which states (in Section 2) that, \"The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year, and such meeting shall begin at noon on the third day of January, unless they shall by law appoint a different day\". This change virtually eliminated the necessity of there being a lame duck session of Congress.\nSection 5: Procedure.\nClause 1: Electoral judgement; quorum.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members, and a Majority of each shall constitute a Quorum to do Business; but a smaller Number may adjourn from day to day, and may be authorized to compel the Attendance of absent Members, in such Manner, and under such Penalties as each House may provide.\nSection Five states that a majority of each House constitutes a quorum to do business; a smaller number may adjourn the House or compel the attendance of absent members. In practice, the quorum requirement is not followed, as a quorum is assumed to be present unless a quorum call, requested by a member, proves otherwise. Rarely do members ask for quorum calls to demonstrate the absence of a quorum; more often, they use the quorum call as a delaying tactic. This clause also states that each House is the judge of the elections, returns and the qualifications of its own members. This power means that the Senate or House can conduct an investigation of an election when the losing candidate present a petition, and have the power to exclude the member if the Senate or House has judged that the election had irregularities. An example of this power being used was in 1974 when the Senate voted to declare the New Hampshire Senate seat vacant due to alleged irregularities during the 1974 United States Senate election in New Hampshire. However, the power to disqualify duly elected members is not absolute. The Supreme Court ruled in the case \"Powell v. McCormack\" (1969) that the House of Representatives can only exclude duly elected members for only reasons in the Qualification of Members Clause. \nSometimes, unqualified individuals have been admitted to Congress. For instance, the Senate once admitted John Henry Eaton, a twenty-eight-year-old, in 1818 (the admission was inadvertent, as Eaton's birth date was unclear at the time). In 1934, a twenty-nine-year-old, Rush Holt, was elected to the Senate; he agreed to wait six months, until his thirtieth birthday, to take the oath. The Senate ruled in that case that the age requirement applied as of the date of the taking of the oath, not the date of election.\nClause 2: Rules.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behavior, and, with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a member.\nEach house can determine its own rules (assuming a quorum is present), and may punish any of its members. A two-thirds vote is necessary to expel a member. Section 5, Clause 2 does not provide specific guidance to each House regarding when and how each House may change its rules, leaving details to the respective chambers.\nClause 3: Record of proceedings.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Each House shall keep a Journal of its Proceedings, and from time to time publish the same, excepting such Parts as may in their Judgment require Secrecy; and the Yeas and Nays of the Members of either House on any question shall, at the desire of one fifth of those present, be entered on the Journal.\nEach house must keep and publish a journal, though it may choose to keep any part of the Journal secret. The proceedings of the House are recorded in the journal; if one-fifth of those present (assuming a quorum is present) request it, the votes of the members on a particular question must also be entered.\nClause 4: Adjournment.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Neither House, during the Session of Congress, shall, without the Consent of the other, adjourn for three or more days, nor to any other Place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting.\nNeither house may adjourn, without the consent of the other, for more than three days. Often, a house will hold \"pro forma\" sessions every three days; such sessions are merely held to fulfill the constitutional requirement, and not to conduct business. Furthermore, neither house may meet in any place other than that designated for both houses (the Capitol), without the consent of the other house.\nSection 6: Compensation, privileges, and restrictions on holding civil office.\nClause 1: Compensation and legal protection.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States. They shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place.\nSenators and representatives set their own compensation. Under the Twenty-seventh Amendment, any change in their compensation will not take effect until after the next congressional election. Paying senators and representatives out of the federal treasury was a departure from the practice under the Articles of Confederation, where they were paid by the state in which they were elected.\nMembers of both houses have certain privileges, based on those enjoyed by the members of the British Parliament. Members attending, going to or returning from either house are privileged from arrest, except for treason, felony or breach of the peace. One may not sue a senator or representative for slander occurring during congressional debate, nor may a speech by a member of Congress during a congressional session be the basis for criminal prosecution. The latter was affirmed when Mike Gravel published over 4,000 pages of the \"Pentagon Papers\" in the \"Congressional Record\", which might have otherwise been a criminal offense. This clause has also been interpreted in \"Gravel v. United States\", 408 U.S. 606 (1972) to provide protection to aides and staff of sitting members of Congress, so long as their activities relate to legislative matters.\nClause 2: Independence from the executive.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time; and no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office.\nSenators and representatives may not simultaneously serve in Congress and hold a position in the executive branch. This restriction is meant to protect legislative independence by preventing the president from using patronage to buy votes in Congress. It is a major difference from the Westminster political system in the British Parliament as well as those of some other nations using the parliamentary system, where cabinet ministers are required to be members of parliament.\nFurthermore, senators and representatives cannot resign to take newly created or higher-paying political positions; rather, they must wait until the conclusion of the term for which they were elected. If Congress increases the salary of a particular officer, it may later reduce that salary to permit an individual to resign from Congress and take that position (known as the Saxbe fix). The effects of the clause were discussed in 1937, when Senator Hugo Black was appointed an associate justice of the Supreme Court with some time left in his Senate term. Just prior to the appointment, Congress had increased the pension available to Justices retiring at the age of seventy. It was therefore suggested by some that the office's emolument had been increased during Black's senatorial term, and that therefore Black could not take office as a justice. The response, however, was that Black was fifty-one years old, and would not receive the increased pension until at least 19 years later, long after his Senate term had expired.\nSection 7: Bills.\nClause 1: Bills of revenue.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.\nThis establishes the method for making acts of Congress that involve taxation. Accordingly, any bill may originate in either house of Congress, except for a revenue bill, which may originate only in the House of Representatives. In practice, the Senate sometimes circumvents this requirement by substituting the text of a revenue bill previously passed by the House with a substitute text. Either House may amend any bill, including revenue and appropriation bills.\nThis clause of the U.S. Constitution stemmed from an English parliamentary practice that all money bills must have their first reading in the House of Commons. This practice was intended to ensure that the power of the purse is possessed by the legislative body most responsive to the people, although the English practice was modified in America by allowing the Senate to amend these bills. The clause was part of the Great Compromise between small and large states; the large states were unhappy with the lopsided power of small states in the Senate, and so the clause theoretically offsets the unrepresentative nature of the Senate, and compensates the large states for allowing equal voting rights to senators from small states.\nClause 2: From bill to law.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be presented to the President of the United States; If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law. But in all such Cases the Votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and Nays, and the Names of the Persons voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each House respectively. If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law.\nThis clause is known as the Presentment Clause. Before a bill becomes law, it must be presented to the president, who has ten days (excluding Sundays) to act upon it. If the president signs the bill, it becomes law. However, to propose a constitutional amendment, two-thirds of both houses may submit it to the states for the ratification, without any consideration by the president, as prescribed in Article V. If he disapproves of the bill, he must return it to the House in which it originated together with his objections. This procedure has become known as the veto, although that particular word does not appear in the text of Article One. The bill does not then become law unless both Houses, by two-thirds votes, override the veto. In overriding a veto, the votes of both houses must be done by yeas and nays, and the names of the persons voting for and against the bill must be recorded. If the president neither signs nor returns the bill within the ten-day limit, the bill becomes law, unless Congress has adjourned in the meantime, thereby preventing the president from returning the bill to the House in which it originated. In the latter case, the president, by taking no action on the bill towards the end of a session, exercises a \"pocket veto\", which Congress may not override. In the former case, where the president allows a bill to become law unsigned, there is no common name for the practice, but recent scholarship has termed it a \"default enactment.\"\nWhat exactly constitutes an adjournment for the purposes of the pocket veto has been unclear. In the \"Pocket Veto Case\" (1929), the Supreme Court held that \"the determinative question in reference to an 'adjournment' is not whether it is a final adjournment of Congress or an interim adjournment, such as an adjournment of the first session, but whether it is one that 'prevents' the president from returning the bill to the House in which it originated within the time allowed.\" Since neither House of Congress was in session, the president could not return the bill to one of them, thereby permitting the use of the pocket veto. In \"Wright v. United States\" (1938), however, the Court ruled that adjournments of one House only did not constitute an adjournment of Congress required for a pocket veto. In such cases, the Secretary or Clerk of the House in question was ruled competent to receive the bill.\nSome presidents have made very extensive use of the veto, while others have not used it at all. Grover Cleveland, for instance, vetoed over four hundred bills during his first term in office; Congress overrode only two of those vetoes. Meanwhile, seven presidents have never used the veto power. There have been 2,560 vetoes, including pocket vetoes.\nIn 1996, Congress passed the Line Item Veto Act, which permitted the president, at the time of the signing of the bill, to rescind certain expenditures. Congress could disapprove the cancellation and reinstate the funds. The president could veto the disapproval, but Congress, by a two-thirds vote in each house, could override the veto. In the case \"Clinton v. City of New York\", the Supreme Court found the Line Item Veto Act unconstitutional because it violated the Presentment Clause. First, the procedure delegated legislative powers to the president, thereby violating the nondelegation doctrine. Second, the procedure violated the terms of Section Seven, which state, \"if he approve [the bill] he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it.\" Thus, the president may sign the bill, veto it, or do nothing, but he may not amend the bill and then sign it.\nClause 3: Resolutions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United States; and before the Same shall take Effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed in the Case of a Bill.\nEvery order, resolution, or vote that must be passed by both houses, except on a question of adjournment, must also be presented to the president before taking effect, just as with bills that become law.\nSection 8: Powers of Congress.\nEnumerated powers.\nCongress's legislative powers are enumerated in Section Eight. Its 18 clauses are, in order:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMany powers of Congress have been granted under a broad interpretation of Article 1, section 8. Most notably, Clauses 1 (the General Welfare or Taxing and Spending clause), 3 (the Commerce clause), and 18 (The Necessary and Proper clause) have been deemed to grant expansive powers to Congress. These three clauses have been interpreted so broadly that the federal government of the United States exercises many powers that are not expressly delegated to it by the states under the Constitution. Some point to the various social programs of the American welfare state as a prime example, and not all agree with this broad interpretation. James Madison, who wrote much of the Constitution, asserted that Congress could not exercise powers unless they were expressly granted in the Constitution. While he was president of the United States, Madison vetoed the Federal Public Works Bill of 1817, calling it unconstitutional, since in his view the federal government did not have the authority to build infrastructure.\nClause 1: the General Welfare Clause.\nThis clause is also referred to as the Spending Clause and the Taxing and Spending Clause. It states that Congress may lay and collect taxes for the \"common defense\" or \"general welfare\" of the United States. The U.S. Supreme Court has not often defined \"general welfare\", leaving the political question to Congress. In \"United States v. Butler\" (1936), the Court for the first time construed the clause. The dispute centered on a tax collected from processors of agricultural products such as meat; the funds raised by the tax were not paid into the general funds of the treasury, but were rather specially earmarked for farmers. The Court struck down the tax, ruling that the general welfare language in the Taxing and Spending Clause related only to \"matters of national, as distinguished from local, welfare\". Congress continues to make expansive use of the Taxing and Spending Clause; for instance, the social security program is authorized under the Taxing and Spending Clause.\nClause 2: Borrowing Power.\nCongress has the power to borrow money on the credit of the United States. In 1871, when deciding \"Knox v. Lee,\" the Court ruled that this clause permitted Congress to emit bills and make them legal tender in satisfaction of debts. Whenever Congress borrows money, it is obligated to repay the sum as stipulated in the original agreement. However, such agreements are only \"binding on the conscience of the sovereign\", as the doctrine of sovereign immunity prevents a creditor from suing in court if the government reneges on its commitment.\nClause 3: Commerce Clause.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Congress shall have Power [...] To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes;\nThe Supreme Court has seldom restrained the use of the \"commerce clause\" for widely varying purposes. The first important decision related to the commerce clause was \"Gibbons v. Ogden\", decided by a unanimous Court in 1824. The case involved conflicting federal and state laws: Thomas Gibbons had a federal permit to navigate steamboats in the Hudson River, while the other, Aaron Ogden, had a monopoly to do the same granted by the state of New York. Ogden contended that \"commerce\" included only buying and selling of goods and not their transportation. Chief Justice John Marshall rejected this notion. Marshall suggested that \"commerce\" included navigation of goods, and that it \"must have been contemplated\" by the Framers. Marshall added that Congress's power over commerce \"is complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations other than are prescribed in the Constitution\".\nThe expansive interpretation of the Commerce Clause was restrained during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when a \"laissez-faire\" attitude dominated the Court. In \"United States v. E. C. Knight Company\" (1895), the Supreme Court limited the newly enacted Sherman Antitrust Act, which had sought to break up the monopolies dominating the nation's economy. The Court ruled that Congress could not regulate the manufacture of goods, even if they were later shipped to other states. Chief Justice Melville Fuller wrote, \"commerce succeeds to manufacture, and is not a part of it\".\nThe U.S. Supreme Court sometimes ruled New Deal programs unconstitutional because they stretched the meaning of the commerce clause. In \"Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States\" (1935), the Court unanimously struck down industrial codes regulating the slaughter of poultry, declaring that Congress could not regulate commerce relating to the poultry, which had \"come to a permanent rest within the State\". As Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes put it, \"so far as the poultry here in question is concerned, the flow of interstate commerce has ceased.\" Judicial rulings against attempted use of Congress's Commerce Clause powers continued during the 1930s.\nIn 1937, the Supreme Court began moving away from its laissez-faire attitude concerning Congressional legislation and the Commerce Clause, when it ruled in \"National Labor Relations Board v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Company\", that the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 (commonly known as the Wagner Act) was constitutional. The legislation under scrutiny prevented employers from engaging in \"unfair labor practices\" such as firing workers for joining unions. In sustaining this act, the Court signaled its return to the philosophy espoused by John Marshall, that Congress could pass laws regulating actions that even indirectly influenced interstate commerce.\nThis new attitude became firmly set into place in 1942. In \"Wickard v. Filburn\", the Court ruled that production quotas under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 were constitutionally applied to agricultural production (in this instance, home-grown wheat for private consumption) that was consumed purely intrastate, because its effect upon interstate commerce placed it within the power of Congress to regulate under the Commerce Clause. This decision marked the beginning of the Court's total deference to Congress's claims of Commerce Clause powers, which lasted into the 1990s.\n\"United States v. Lopez\" (1995) was the first decision in six decades to invalidate a federal statute on the grounds that it exceeded the power of Congress under the Commerce Clause. The Court held that while Congress had broad lawmaking authority under the Commerce Clause, the power was limited, and did not extend so far from \"commerce\" as to authorize the regulation of the carrying of handguns, especially when there was no evidence that carrying them affected the economy on a massive scale. In a later case, \"United States v. Morrison\" (2000), the justices ruled that Congress could not make such laws even when there was evidence of aggregate effect.\nIn contrast to these rulings, the Supreme Court also continues to follow the precedent set by \"Wickard v. Filburn\". In \"Gonzales v. Raich\" it ruled that the Commerce Clause granted Congress the authority to criminalize the production and use of home-grown cannabis even where states approve its use for medicinal purposes. The court held that, as with the agricultural production in the earlier case, home-grown cannabis is a legitimate subject of federal regulation because it competes with marijuana that moves in interstate commerce.\nOther powers of Congress.\nCongress may establish uniform laws relating to naturalization and bankruptcy. It may also coin money, regulate the value of American or foreign currency and punish counterfeiters. Congress may fix the standards of weights and measures. Furthermore, Congress may establish post offices and post roads (the roads, however, need not be exclusively for the conveyance of mail). Congress may promote the progress of science and useful arts by granting copyrights and patents of limited duration. Section eight, clause eight of Article One, known as the Copyright Clause, is the only instance of the word \"right\" used in the original constitution (though the word does appear in several Amendments). Though perpetual copyrights and patents are prohibited, the Supreme Court has ruled in \"Eldred v. Ashcroft\" (2003) that repeated extensions to the term of copyright do not constitute perpetual copyright; this is the only power granted where the means to accomplish its stated purpose is specifically provided for. Courts inferior to the Supreme Court may be established by Congress.\nCongress has several powers related to war and the armed forces. Under the War Powers Clause, only Congress may declare war, but in several cases it has, without declaring war, granted the president the authority to engage in military conflicts. Five wars have been declared in United States' history: the War of 1812, the Mexican\u2013American War, the Spanish\u2013American War, World War I and World War II. Some historians argue that the legal doctrines and legislation passed during the operations against Pancho Villa constitute a sixth declaration of war. Congress may grant letters of marque and reprisal. Congress may establish and support the armed forces, but no appropriation made for the support of the army may be used for more than two years. This provision was inserted because the Framers feared the establishment of a standing army, beyond civilian control, during peacetime. Congress may regulate or call forth the state militias, but the states retain the authority to appoint officers and train personnel. Congress also has exclusive power to make rules and regulations governing the land and naval forces. Although the executive branch and the Pentagon have asserted an ever-increasing measure of involvement in this process, the U.S. Supreme Court has often reaffirmed Congress's exclusive hold on this power (e.g. Burns v. Wilson, 346 U.S. 137 (1953)). Congress used this power twice soon after World War II with the enactment of two statutes: the Uniform Code of Military Justice to improve the quality and fairness of courts martial and military justice, and the Federal Tort Claims Act which among other rights had allowed military service persons to sue for damages until the U.S. Supreme Court repealed that section of the statute in a divisive series of cases, known collectively as the Feres Doctrine.\nCongress has the exclusive right to legislate \"in all cases whatsoever\" for the nation's capital, the District of Columbia. Congress chooses to devolve some of such authority to the elected mayor and council of District of Columbia. Nevertheless, Congress remains free to enact any legislation for the District so long as constitutionally permissible, to overturn any legislation by the city government, and technically to revoke the city government at any time. Congress may also exercise such jurisdiction over land purchased from the states for the erection of forts and other buildings.\nClause 10: Offenses Against the Law of Nations Clause.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Congress shall have Power ... To define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas, and Offences against the Law of Nations;\u00a0...\nThe \"Offenses Clause\" was developed to address the national government's inability to conduct foreign affairs effectively under the Articles of Confederation, which left it up to states to \"provide expeditious, exemplary and adequate punishment\u00a0... for the infractions of the immunities of ambassadors and other public ministers\". Edmund Randolph, a delegate to the Constitutional Convention, cited this arrangement as one of the major \"defects\" of the Articles, since it left no consistent or uniform recourse for foreign dignitaries and merchants.\nAt the time clause was drafted, piracy was the only universal crime that was well defined by the law of nations, and Congress soon addressed it through a federal statute in 1790. Felonies committed in international waters had to be specifically defined by Congress pursuant to the U.S. Supreme Court decision in \"United States v. Furlong\" (1820). However, determining the grounds on which Congress can define offenses against the law of nations has been more difficult, due largely to uncertainty about the meaning of the term \"law of nations\" and its scope.\nClause 18: Implied Powers of Congress (Necessary and Proper).\nRegarding the implied powers of Congress, the Constitution specifically states all implied or additional powers permitted to the Congress are limited exclusively to the \"Powers vested\", to the Congress, \"by this Constitution\" (not \"the Powers vested in it\"); meaning, whatever is not expressly written or obviously implied within the Constitution cannot be inferred as being part of, nor permitted by, the Constitution. In other words, Congress cannot create additional powers for itself to wield. Any powers deemed \"necessary and proper\" are limited and restricted to carrying out the functions of government as prescribed within the Constitution and ensuring those functions continued operations. E.g., the Constitution states Congress shall manage the government purse through the creation of a Treasury, thus there must be a Department of the Treasury with a sub-division which accounts for every penny coming and going, pays government debts, &amp;c.; whereas nowhere in the Constitution can it be inferred that the Second Amendment right to bear arms necessitates a Department of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATFE). The Department of the Treasury, along with many of its sub-divisions, is entirely Constitutional; but the Secret Service was not created until July 5, 1865 (four months after President Abraham Lincoln's assassination) specifically to combat counterfeiting, which is a task delegated to the Department of the Treasury by Congress. Congress constitutionally expanded the Secret Service's duties to include Presidential protection only after President William McKinley was assassinated in 1901. The Internal Revenue Service falls under the jurisdiction of the Federal Reserve and the Department of the Treasury is not part of the Federal Reserve, nor is the Federal Reserve part of the Department of the Treasury.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Congress shall have Power [...] To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.\nFinally, Congress has the power to do whatever is \"necessary and proper\" to carry out its enumerated powers and, crucially, all others vested in it. This has been interpreted to authorize criminal prosecution of those whose actions have a \"substantial effect\" on interstate commerce in \"Wickard v. Filburn\"; however, Thomas Jefferson, in the Kentucky Resolutions, supported by James Madison, maintained that a penal power could not be inferred from a power to regulate, and that the only penal powers were for treason, counterfeiting, piracy and felony on the high seas, and offenses against the law of nations.\nThe Necessary and Proper Clause has been interpreted extremely broadly, thereby giving Congress wide latitude in legislation. The first landmark case involving the clause was \"McCulloch v. Maryland\" (1819), which involved the establishment of a national bank. Alexander Hamilton, in advocating the creation of the bank, argued that there was \"a more or less direct\" relationship between the bank and \"the powers of collecting taxes, borrowing money, regulating trade between the states, and raising and maintaining fleets and navies\". Thomas Jefferson countered that Congress's powers \"can all be carried into execution without a national bank. A bank therefore is not necessary, and consequently not authorized by this phrase\". Chief Justice John Marshall agreed with the former interpretation. Marshall wrote that a Constitution listing \"all\" of Congress's powers \"would partake of a prolixity of a legal code and could scarcely be embraced by the human mind\". Since the Constitution could not possibly enumerate the \"minor ingredients\" of the powers of Congress, Marshall \"deduced\" that Congress had the authority to establish a bank from the \"great outlines\" of the general welfare, commerce and other clauses. Under this doctrine of the necessary and proper clause, Congress has sweepingly broad powers (known as implied powers) not explicitly enumerated in the Constitution. However, the Congress cannot enact laws solely on the implied powers, any action must be necessary and proper in the execution of the enumerated powers.\nSection 9: Powers denied Congress.\nThe ninth section of Article One places limits on Congressional powers, as well as stating related restrictions on other branches.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Migration or Importation of such Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the Year one thousand eight hundred and eight, but a Tax or duty may be imposed on such Importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each Person.\nThe Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\nNo Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed.\nNo Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken.\nNo Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State.\nNo Preference shall be given by any Regulation of Commerce or Revenue to the Ports of one State over those of another: nor shall Vessels bound to, or from, one State, be obliged to enter, clear, or pay Duties in another.\nNo Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time.\nNo Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.\nClause 1: Slave trade.\nThe first clause in this section prevented Congress from passing any law that would restrict the importation of slaves into the United States prior to 1808. Congress could, however, levy a \"per capita\" duty of up to ten Spanish milled dollars for each slave imported into the country. This clause was further entrenched into the Constitution by Article V, where it was explicitly shielded from constitutional amendment prior to 1808. On March 2, 1807, Congress approved legislation prohibiting the importation of slaves into the United States, which went into effect on January 1, 1808, the first day of the prohibition permitted by the Constitution. This clause did see brief life outside of the slavery context in the late 1790s when the Virginia General Assembly cited it in arguing the Alien Enemies Act was unconstitutional, the federal act being used by the Adams administration to deport French immigrants the Commonwealth had itself seen proper to admit.\nClauses 2 and 3: Civil and legal protections.\nA writ of \"habeas corpus\" is a legal action against unlawful detainment that commands a law enforcement agency or other body that has a person in custody to have a court inquire into the legality of the detention. The court may order the person released if the reason for detention is deemed insufficient or unjustifiable. The Constitution further provides that the privilege of the writ of \"habeas corpus\" may not be suspended \"unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it\". In \"Ex parte Milligan\" (1866), the Supreme Court ruled that the suspension of \"habeas corpus\" in a time of war was lawful, but military tribunals did not apply to citizens in states that had upheld the authority of the Constitution and where civilian courts were still operating.\nFor these stipulations, clauses 2 and 3 are also known as the Suspension Clause.\nA bill of attainder is a legislative bill or act that legally declares a person guilty of a crime, regardless of whether a trial has been held. An \"ex post facto\" law is a law which applies retroactively, punishing someone for an act that was only made criminal after it was done. The \"ex post facto\" clause does not apply to civil matters.\nClause 4: Apportionment of direct taxes.\nSection Nine reiterates the provision from that direct taxes must be apportioned by state populations. This clause was also explicitly shielded from constitutional amendment prior to 1808 by Article V. In 1913, the 16th Amendment exempted all income taxes from this clause. This overcame the ruling in \"Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co.\" that the income tax could only be applied to regular income and could not be applied to dividends and capital gains.\nClauses 5 and 6: Restrictions on trade-related legislation.\nFurthermore, no tax may be imposed on exports from any state. Congress may not, by revenue or commerce legislation, give preference to ports of one state over those of another; neither may it require ships from one state to pay duties in another.\nClause 7: Appropriations and public statements of expenditures.\nAll funds belonging to the Treasury may not be withdrawn except according to law. Modern practice is that Congress annually passes a number of appropriations bills authorizing the expenditure of public money. The Constitution requires that a regular statement of such expenditures be published.\nClause 8: Titles of nobility.\nThe Title of Nobility Clause prohibits Congress from granting any title of nobility. In addition, it specifies that no civil officer may accept, without the consent of Congress, any gift, payment, office or title from a foreign ruler or state. Emoluments were a profound concern of the Founders. However, a U.S. citizen may receive foreign office before or after their period of public service.\nSection 10: Limits on the States.\nClause 1: Contract Clause.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility.\nStates may not exercise certain powers reserved for the federal government: they may not enter into treaties, alliances or confederations, grant letters of marque or reprisal, coin money or issue bills of credit (such as currency). Furthermore, no state may make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts, which expressly forbids any state government (but not the federal government) from \"making a tender\" (i.e., authorizing something that may be offered in payment) of any type or form of money to meet any financial obligation, unless that form of money is coins made of gold or silver (or a medium of exchange backed by and redeemable in gold or silver coins, as noted in \"Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank v. Federal Reserve Bank\"). Much of this clause is devoted to preventing the States from using or creating any currency other than that created by Congress. In \"Federalist\" no. 44, Madison explains that \"it may be observed that the same reasons which shew the necessity of denying to the States the power of regulating coin, prove with equal force that they ought not to be at liberty to substitute a paper medium in the place of coin. Had every State a right to regulate the value of its coin, there might be as many different currencies as States; and thus the intercourse among them would be impeded\". Moreover, the states may not pass bills of attainder, enact \"ex post facto\" laws, impair the obligation of contracts, or grant titles of nobility.\nThe Contract Clause was the subject of much contentious litigation in the 19th century. It was first interpreted by the Supreme Court in 1810, when \"Fletcher v. Peck\" was decided. The case involved the Yazoo land scandal, in which the Georgia legislature authorized the sale of land to speculators at low prices. The bribery involved in the passage of the authorizing legislation was so blatant that a Georgia mob attempted to lynch the corrupt members of the legislature. Following elections, the legislature passed a law that rescinded the contracts granted by corrupt legislators. The validity of the annulment of the sale was questioned in the Supreme Court. In writing for a unanimous court, Chief Justice John Marshall asked, \"What is a contract?\" His answer was: \"a compact between two or more parties\". Marshall argued that the sale of land by the Georgia legislature, though fraught with corruption, was a valid \"contract\". He added that the state had no right to annul the purchase of the land since doing so would impair the obligations of the contract.\nThe definition of a contract propounded by Chief Justice Marshall was not as simple as it may seem. In 1819, the Court considered whether a corporate charter could be construed as a contract. The case of \"Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward\" involved Dartmouth College, which had been established under a royal charter granted by King George III. The Charter created a board of twelve trustees for the governance of the College. In 1815, however, New Hampshire passed a law increasing the board's membership to twenty-one with the aim that public control could be exercised over the College. The Court, including Marshall, ruled that New Hampshire could not amend the charter, which was ruled to be a contract since it conferred \"vested rights\" on the trustees.\nThe Marshall Court determined another dispute in \"Sturges v. Crowninshield\". The case involved a debt that was contracted in early 1811. Later in that year, the state of New York passed a bankruptcy law, under which the debt was later discharged. The Supreme Court ruled that a retroactively applied state bankruptcy law impaired the obligation to pay the debt, and therefore violated the Constitution. In \"Ogden v. Saunders\" (1827), however, the court decided that state bankruptcy laws \"could\" apply to debts contracted after the passage of the law. State legislation on the issue of bankruptcy and debtor relief has not been much of an issue since the adoption of a comprehensive federal bankruptcy law in 1898.\nClause 2: Import-Export Clause.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;No State shall, without the Consent of the Congress, lay any Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing it's [\"sic\"] inspection Laws: and the net Produce of all Duties and Imposts, laid by any State on Imports or Exports, shall be for the Use of the Treasury of the United States; and all such Laws shall be subject to the Revision and Controul [\"sic\"] of the Congress.\nStill more powers are prohibited of the states. States may not, without the consent of Congress, tax imports or exports except for the fulfillment of state inspection laws (which may be revised by Congress). The net revenue of the tax is paid not to the state, but to the federal Treasury.\nClause 3: Compact Clause.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;No State shall, without the Consent of Congress, lay any Duty of Tonnage, keep Troops, or Ships of War in time of Peace, enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power, or engage in War, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.\nUnder the Compact Clause, states may not, without the consent of Congress, keep troops or armies during times of peace, or enter into agreements with other states or with foreign governments. Furthermore, states may not engage in war unless invaded. States may, however, organize and arm a militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress. The National Guard, whose members are also members of the militia as defined by \u00a0https://, fulfill this function, as do persons serving in a state defense force with federal oversight under \u00a0https://.\nThe idea of allowing Congress to have say over agreements between states traces back to the numerous controversies that arose between various colonies. Eventually compromises would be created between the two colonies and these compromises would be submitted to the Crown for approval. After the American Revolutionary War, the Articles of Confederation allowed states to appeal to Congress to settle disputes between the states over boundaries or \"any cause whatever\". The Articles of Confederation also required congressional approval for \"any treaty or alliance\" in which a state was one of the parties.\nA number of Supreme Court cases have concerned what constitutes valid Congressional consent to an interstate compact. In \"Virginia v. Tennessee\", 148 U.S. https:// (1893), the Court found that some agreements among states stand even when lacking the explicit consent of Congress. One example the court gave was a state moving some goods from a distant state to itself, for which it would not require Congressional approval to contract with another state to use its canals for transport. According to the Court, the Compact Clause requires Congressional consent only if the agreement among the states is \"directed to the formation of any combination tending to the increase of political power in the States, which may encroach upon or interfere with the just supremacy of the United States\".\nThe congressional consent issue is at the center of the debate over the constitutionality of the proposed National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (NPVIC). As of \u00a02024[ [update]], seventeen states plus the District of Columbia have joined the NPVIC.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31647", "revid": "50964715", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31647", "title": "Article Two of the United States Constitution", "text": "Portion of the U.S. Constitution regarding the executive branch and impeachment\nArticle Two of the United States Constitution establishes the executive branch of the federal government, which carries out and enforces federal laws. Article Two vests the power of the executive branch in the office of the president of the United States, lays out the procedures for electing and removing the president, and establishes the president's powers and responsibilities.\nSection 1 of Article Two establishes the positions of the president and the vice president, and sets the term of both offices at four years. Section 1's Vesting Clause declares that the executive power of the federal government is vested in the president and, along with the Vesting Clauses of Article One and Article Three, establishes the separation of powers among the three branches of government. Section 1 also establishes the Electoral College, the body charged with electing the president and the vice president. Section 1 provides that each state chooses members of the Electoral College in a manner directed by each state's respective legislature, with the states granted electors equal to their combined representation in both houses of Congress. Section 1 lays out the procedures of the Electoral College and requires the House of Representatives to hold a contingent election to select the president if no individual wins a majority of the electoral vote. Section 1 also sets forth the eligibility requirements for the office of the president, provides procedures in case of a presidential vacancy, and requires the president to take an oath of office.\nSection 2 of Article Two lays out the powers of the presidency, establishing that the president serves as the commander-in-chief of the military. This section gives the president the power to grant pardons. Section 2 also requires the \"principal officer\" of any executive department to tender advice.\nThough not required by Article Two, President George Washington organized the principal officers of the executive departments into the Cabinet, a practice that subsequent presidents have followed. The Treaty Clause grants the president the power to enter into treaties with the approval of two-thirds of the Senate. The Appointments Clause grants the president the power to appoint judges and public officials subject to the advice and consent of the Senate, which in practice, has meant that Presidential appointees must be confirmed by a majority vote in the Senate. The Appointments Clause also establishes that Congress can, by law, allow the president, the courts, or the heads of departments to appoint \"inferior officers\" without requiring the advice and consent of the Senate. The final clause of Section 2 grants the president the power to make recess appointments to fill vacancies that occur when the Senate is in recess.\nSection 3 of Article Two lays out the responsibilities of the president, granting the president the power to convene both Houses of Congress, receive foreign representatives, and commission all federal officers. Section 3 requires the president to inform Congress of the \"state of the union\"; since 1913, this has taken the form of a speech referred to as the State of the Union. The Recommendation Clause requires the president to recommend measures deemed \"necessary and expedient.\" The Take Care Clause requires the president to obey and enforce all laws, though the president retains some discretion in interpreting the laws and determining how to enforce them.\nSection 4 of Article Two gives directives on impeachment. The directive states, \"The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States shall be removed from office on Impeachment for, and conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\"\nSection 1: President and vice president.\nClause 1: Executive power and term of office.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America. He shall hold his Office during the Term of four Years, and, together with the Vice President, chosen for the same Term, be elected, as follows:\nSection 1 begins with a vesting clause that confers federal executive power upon the president. Similar clauses are found in Article I and Article III; the former bestows federal legislative power exclusively to Congress, and the latter grants judicial power solely to the Supreme Court, and other federal courts established by law. These three articles together secure a separation of powers among the three branches of the federal government, and individually, each one entrenches checks and balances on the operation and power of the other two branches.\nArticle I grants to Congress, and the Vesting Clause does not reassign those powers to the president. In fact, because those actions require legislation passed by Congress which must be signed by the president to take effect, those powers are not strictly executive powers granted to or retained by Congress per se. Nor were they retained by the U.S. Congress as leftovers from the Articles of Confederation. The Articles of Confederation, Continental Congress and its powers were abolished at the time the new U.S. Congress was seated and the new federal government formally and officially replaced its interim predecessor.\nThe President may order military action in defense of the United States pursuant to \"a national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces\". The President must notify Congress within 48 hours after the beginning of military operations, giving the source of his authority for the action. Once legal notification is given to Congress, military action can continue for up to 60 days without further authorization from Congress, or up to 90 days if the President \"determines and certifies to the Congress in writing that unavoidable military necessity respecting the safety of United States Armed Forces requires the continued use of such armed forces in the course of bringing about a prompt removal of such forces.\"\nTreaties are official agreements with foreign governments. Treaties must be approved by a two-thirds majority in the Senate in order to enter into force into U.S. law. While the President does not make treaties, the President shapes and determines U.S. foreign policy initiatives, can enter into discussions and give conditional approval to agreements reached with foreign governments subject to Senate approval.\nIn their capacity as head of state and individual representative of the United States, the president has the authority to withdraw the United States from treaties when it is in the best interests and well being of the U.S.\nPresidential appointments are approved by advice and consent of the Senate. Senate consent occurs when a majority of senators votes to approve a nominee.\nThe head of the executive branch is the president. The Constitution states that the president and vice president are to be elected at the same time, for the same term, and by the same constituency. It is believed the framers wanted to preserve the independence of the executive branch should the vice president assume the presidency.\nClause 2: Method of choosing electors.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.\nUnder the U.S. Constitution, the president and vice president are chosen by electors, under a constitutional grant of authority delegated to the legislatures of the several states. The Constitution reserves the choice of the precise manner for selecting electors to the will of the state legislatures. It does not define or delimit what process a state legislature may use to create its \"state\" college of electors. In practice, the state legislatures have generally chosen to select electors through an indirect popular vote, since the 1820s. Most states use a \"winner-take-all\" system in which all the state's electors are awarded to the candidate gaining the most popular votes. Maine and Nebraska allow individual congressional districts to each elect one elector.\nIn an indirect popular vote, it is the names of the candidates who are on the ballot to be elected. Most states do not put the names of the electors on the ballot. It is generally understood by the voters and the electors themselves that they are the representative \"stand-ins\" for the candidates and are expected to cast their electoral college ballots for the president and vice president who appeared on the ballot. The actual electors being voted for are usually selected by the candidate's party. There have been a few cases where some electors have refused to vote for the designated candidate, termed a faithless elector. Many states have mandated in law that electors \"shall\" cast their electoral college ballot for the designated presidential candidate. The constitutionality of such mandates was established by the Supreme Court of the United States in \"Chiafalo v. Washington\" (2020).\nEach state chooses as many electors as it has representatives and senators representing it in Congress. Under the 23rd Amendment, the District of Columbia may choose no more electors than the state with the lowest number of electoral votes (in effect, three electors), although since that amendment's ratification the District's population has never reached the threshold that would otherwise entitle it to choose four or more electors. U.S. Senators, Representatives and federal government officials are barred from becoming electors; in practice, the two major federal parties frequently select senior state party and government officials (up to and including governors) to serve as electors.\nAll states other than Maine (including the District of Columbia) use a first past the post system in their presidential elections. In 2020, Maine switched from first past the post to ranked choice.\nIn \"McPherson v. Blacker\" (1892), the Supreme Court affirmed the ability of a state to appoint its electors based on electoral districts rather than a statewide popular vote, describing the power of state legislatures to determine the method of appointment of electors as \"plenary\", and suggesting that it was not limited even by state constitutions. In \"Bush v. Palm Beach County Canvassing Board\" (2000), the Supreme Court remanded to the Supreme Court of Florida the question of \"the extent to which the Florida Supreme Court saw the Florida Constitution as circumscribing the legislature's authority under Art. II, \u00a7 1, cl. 2\". In \"Williams v. Rhodes\" (1968), the Court struck down as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause an Ohio law which placed heavy burdens on minor parties seeking to be placed on the ballot for presidential electors.\nThe Supreme Court upheld the power of Congress to regulate political contributions intended to influence the appointment of electors in \"Burroughs v. United States\" (1934).\nClause 3: Electoral College.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote by Ballot for two Persons, of whom one at least shall not be an Inhabitant of the same State with themselves. And they shall make a List of all the Persons voted for, and of the Number of Votes for each; which List they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the Seat of the Government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate. The President of the Senate shall, in the Presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the Certificates, and the Votes shall then be counted. The Person having the greatest Number of Votes shall be the President, if such Number be a Majority of the whole Number of Electors appointed; and if there be more than one who have such Majority, and have an equal Number of Votes, then the House of Representatives shall immediately chuse [\"sic\"] by Ballot one of them for President; and if no Person have a Majority, then from the five highest on the List the said House shall in like Manner chuse [\"sic\"] the President. But in chusing [\"sic\"] the President, the Votes shall be taken by States, the Representation from each State having one Vote; A quorum for this Purpose shall consist of a Member or Members from two thirds of the States, and a Majority of all the States shall be necessary to a Choice. In every Case, after the Choice of the President, the Person having the greatest Number of Votes of the Electors shall be the Vice President. But if there should remain two or more who have equal Votes, the Senate shall chuse [\"sic\"] from them by Ballot the Vice President.\n\"(Note: This procedure was changed by the 12th Amendment in 1804.)\"\nIn modern practice, parties nominate their electors through various methods &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;. Then, each state chooses its electors in popular elections. In most states, the party with the plurality of the popular vote gets all of its electors chosen. Once chosen, the electors meet in their respective states to cast ballots for the president and vice president. Originally, each elector cast two votes for president; at least one of the individuals voted for had to be from a state different from the elector's. The individual with the majority of votes became president, and the runner-up became vice president. In case of a tie between candidates who received votes from a majority of electors, the House of Representatives would choose one of the tied candidates; if no person received a majority, then the House could again choose one of the five with the greatest number of votes. When the House voted, each state delegation cast one vote, and the vote of a majority of states was necessary to choose a president. If second-place candidates were tied, then the Senate broke the tie. A quorum in the House consisted of at least one member from two-thirds of the state delegations; there was no special quorum for the Senate. This procedure was followed in 1801 after the electoral vote produced a tie, and nearly resulted in a deadlock in the House.\nThe 12th Amendment introduced a number of important changes to the procedure. Now, electors do not cast two votes for president; rather, they cast one vote for president and another for vice president. In case no presidential candidate receives a majority, the House chooses from the top three (not five, as before the 12th Amendment). The Amendment also requires the Senate to choose the vice president from those with the two highest figures if no vice presidential candidate receives a majority of electoral votes (rather than only if there's a tie for second for president). It also stipulates that to be the vice president, a person must be qualified to be the president.\nClause 4: Election day.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Congress may determine the Time of chusing [\"sic\"] the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States.\nCongress sets a national Election Day. Currently, electors are chosen on the Tuesday following the first Monday in November (the first Tuesday after November 1), in the year before the president's term is to expire. The electors cast their votes on the Monday following the second Wednesday in December (the first Monday after December 12) of that year. Thereafter, the votes are opened by the president of the Senate, and then counted by Congress in a joint session.\nClause 5: Qualifications for office.\nSection 1 of Article Two of the United States Constitution sets forth the eligibility requirements for serving as president of the United States:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.\nAt the time of taking office, the President must be:\nA person who meets the above qualifications, however, may still be constitutionally barred from holding the office of president under any of the following conditions:\nClause 6: Vacancy and disability.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his Death, Resignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said Office, the Same shall devolve on the Vice President, and the Congress may by Law provide for the Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the President and Vice President, declaring what Officer shall then act as President, and such Officer shall act accordingly, until the Disability be removed, or a President shall be elected.\n\"(Note: This clause was partially superseded by the 25th Amendment in 1967.)\"\nThe wording of this clause caused much controversy at the time it was first used. When William Henry Harrison died in office, a debate arose over whether the vice president would become president, or if he would just inherit the powers, thus becoming an acting president. Harrison's vice president, John Tyler, believed that he had the right to become president. However, many senators argued that he only had the right to assume the powers of the presidency long enough to call for a new election. Because the wording of the clause is so vague, it was impossible for either side to prove its point. Tyler took the Oath of Office as president, setting a precedent that made it possible for later vice presidents to ascend to the presidency unchallenged following the president's death. The \"Tyler Precedent\" established that if the president dies, resigns or is removed from office, the vice president becomes president.\nThe Congress may provide for a line of succession beyond the vice president. The current Presidential Succession Act establishes the order as the speaker of the House of Representatives, the president \"pro tempore\" of the Senate and then the fifteen Cabinet secretaries in order of each department's establishment. There are concerns regarding the constitutionality of having members of Congress in the line of succession, however, as this clause specifies that only an \"officer of the United States\" may be designated as a presidential successor. Constitutional scholars from James Madison to the present day have argued that the term \"officer\" excludes members of Congress.\nThe 25th Amendment explicitly states that if the president dies, resigns or is removed from office, the vice president becomes president, and also establishes a procedure for filling a vacancy in the office of the vice president. The Amendment further provides that the president, or the vice president and Cabinet, can declare the president unable to discharge his or her duties, in which case the vice president becomes Acting president. If the declaration is done by the vice president and Cabinet, the Amendment permits the president to take control back, unless the vice president and Cabinet challenge the president and two-thirds of both Houses vote to sustain the findings of the vice president and Cabinet. If the declaration is done by the president, the president may take control back without risk of being overridden by the Congress.\nClause 7: Salary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The President shall, at stated Times, receive for his Services, a Compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the Period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them.\nThe president's salary, currently $400,000 a year, must remain constant throughout the president's term. The president may not receive other compensation from either the federal or any state government.\nClause 8: Oath or affirmation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Before he enter on the Execution of his Office, he shall take the following Oath or Affirmation:\u2014\"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\"\nAccording to the Joint Congressional Committee on Presidential Inaugurations, George Washington added the words \"So help me God\" during his first inaugural, though this has been disputed. There are no contemporaneous sources for this fact, and no eyewitness sources to Washington's first inaugural mention the phrase at all\u2014including those that transcribed what he said for his oath.\nAlso, the president-elect's name is typically added after the \"I\", for example, \"I, George Washington, do...\" Normally, the chief justice of the United States administers the oath. It is sometimes asserted that the oath bestows upon the president the power to do whatever is necessary to \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\". Andrew Jackson, while vetoing an Act for the renewal of the charter of the national bank, implied that the president could refuse to execute statutes that he felt were unconstitutional. In suspending the privilege of the writ of \"habeas corpus\", President Abraham Lincoln claimed that he acted according to the oath. His action was challenged in court and overturned by the U.S. Circuit Court in Maryland (led by Chief Justice Roger B. Taney) in \"Ex parte Merryman\", 17 F. Cas. 144 (C.C.D. Md. 1861). Lincoln ignored Taney's order. Finally, Andrew Johnson's counsel referred to the theory during his impeachment trial. Otherwise, few have seriously asserted that the oath augments the president's powers.\nThe vice president also has an oath of office, but it is taken under the Oath or Affirmation Clause of Article VI that provides that \"all\u00a0... Officers\u00a0... of the United States\u00a0... shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution\". Pursuant to Article VI, the 1st United States Congress passed the Oath Administration Act (that remains in effect) which provides that \"...the oath or affirmation required by the sixth article of the Constitution of the United States\u00a0... shall be administered to [the President of the Senate]\". Currently, the vice presidential oath is the same as that for members of Congress and members of the Cabinet, which is as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.\nSection 2: Presidential powers.\nIn the landmark decision \"Nixon v. General Services Administration\" (1977), Justice William Rehnquist, afterwards the chief justice, declared in his dissent \"It would require far more of a discourse than could profitably be included in an opinion such as this to fully describe the preeminent position that the president of the United States occupies with respect to our Republic. Suffice it to say that the president is made the sole repository of the executive powers of the United States, and the powers entrusted to him as well as the duties imposed upon him are awesome indeed.\"\nUnlike the modern constitutions of many other countries, which specify when and how a state of emergency may be declared and which rights may be suspended, the U.S. Constitution itself includes no comprehensive separate regime for emergencies. However, according to \"The Atlantic\", some legal scholars believe that the Constitution gives the president inherent emergency powers by making him commander in chief of the armed forces, or by vesting in him a broad, undefined \"executive Power\". Congress has delegated at least 136 distinct statutory emergency powers to the President, each available upon the declaration of an emergency. Only 13 of these require a declaration from Congress; the remaining 123 are assumed by an executive declaration with no further congressional input. Congressionally-authorized emergency presidential powers are sweeping and dramatic and range from seizing control of the Internet to declaring martial law. This led the magazine \"The Atlantic\" to observe that \"the misuse of emergency powers is a standard gambit among leaders attempting to consolidate power\", because, in the words of Justice Robert H. Jackson's dissent in \"Korematsu v. United States\" (1944), the decision that upheld the internment of Japanese Americans, each emergency power \"lies about like a loaded weapon, ready for the hand of any authority that can bring forward a plausible claim of an urgent need.\"\nClause 1: Command of military; Opinions of cabinet secretaries; Pardons.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States; he may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices, and he shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.\nThe Constitution vests the president with executive power. The Supreme Court has interpreted that power as reaching its zenith when wielded to protect national security, and ruled that federal courts in the United States must show deference to the executive in assessing threats to the country. The president is the military's commander-in-chief; however, Article One's War Powers Clause gives Congress, and not the president, the exclusive right to declare war. Nevertheless, the power of the president to initiate hostilities has been subject to question. According to historian Thomas Woods, \"Ever since the Korean War, Article II, Section 2 [...] has been interpreted 'The president has the power to initiate hostilities without consulting Congress' [...] But what the framers actually meant by that clause was that once war has been declared, it was the president's responsibility as commander-in-chief to direct the war. Alexander Hamilton spoke in such terms when he said that the president, although lacking the power to declare war, would have 'the direction of war when authorized or begun.' The president acting alone was authorized only to repel sudden attacks (hence the decision to withhold from him only the power to 'declare' war, not to 'make' war, which was thought to be a necessary emergency power in case of foreign attack).\" Since World War II, major U.S. military engagements, including the Korean War and the Vietnam War, have commenced as \"military operations\" or under the framework of United Nations \"police action\". These campaigns or efforts have been justified through Congressional authorizations, such as the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution and the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq, as well as through United Nations resolutions, providing a basis for their legal legitimacy.\nThe president may require the \"principal officer\" of any executive department to tender their advice in writing. While the Constitution nowhere requires a formal Cabinet, it does authorize the president to seek advice from the principal officers of the various departments as they perform their official duties. George Washington found it prudent to organize his principal officers into a Cabinet, and it has been part of the executive branch structure ever since. Presidents have used Cabinet meetings of selected principal officers to widely differing extents and for different purposes. Secretary of State William H. Seward advocated the use of a parliamentary-style Cabinet government to President Abraham Lincoln, but was rebuffed. Later, Woodrow Wilson advocated use of a parliamentary-style Cabinet while he was a professor, but as president he would have none of it in his administration. In recent administrations, cabinets have grown to include key White House staff in addition to department and agency heads. President Ronald Reagan formed seven subcabinet councils to review many policy issues, and subsequent presidents have followed that practice.\nPardons and reprieves may be granted by the president, except in cases of impeachment. There is currently no universally accepted interpretation of the impeachment exception. Some argue that the president simply cannot use a pardon to stop an officeholder from being impeached, while others suggest that crimes underlying an impeachment cannot be pardoned by the president.\nAs ruled by the Supreme Court in \"United States v. Wilson\" (1833), the pardon could be rejected by the convict. Then, in \"Burdick v. United States\" (1915), the court specifically said, \"Circumstances may be made to bring innocence under the penalties of the law. If so brought, escape by confession of guilt implied in the acceptance of a pardon may be rejected, preferring to be the victim of the law rather than its acknowledged transgressor, preferring death even to such certain infamy.\"\nCommutations (reduction in prison sentence), unlike pardons (restoration of civil rights after prison sentence had been served) may not be refused. In \"Biddle v. Perovich\" 274 U.S. https:// (1927), the subject of the commutation did not want to accept life in prison but wanted the death penalty restored. The Supreme Court said, \"[a] pardon in our days is not a private act of grace from an individual happening to possess power. It is a part of the Constitutional scheme. When granted it is the determination of the ultimate authority that the public welfare will be better served by inflicting less than what the judgment fixed.\"\nClause 2: Advice and Consent Clause.\nThe president exercises the powers in the Advice and Consent Clause with the advice and consent of the Senate.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.\nTreaties.\nThe president shall have the power to make treaties, with approval of two-thirds of the Senate. In Article II however, the Constitution is not explicit about the termination of treaties. The first abrogation of a treaty occurred in 1798, when Congress passed a law terminating the Treaty of Alliance (1778). In 1854, however, President Franklin Pierce terminated a treaty with Denmark with the consent of the Senate. A Senate committee ruled that it was correct procedure for the president to terminate treaties after being authorized by the Senate. President Pierce's successors, however, returned to the former procedure of obtaining authorization from both Houses. Some Presidents have claimed to themselves the exclusive power of terminating treaties. The first unambiguous case of a President terminating a treaty without authorization, granted prior to or after the termination, occurred when Jimmy Carter terminated a treaty with the Republic of China. For the first time, judicial determination was sought, but the effort proved futile: the Supreme Court could not find a majority agreeing on any particular principle, and therefore instructed the trial court to dismiss the case.\nAppointments.\nThe president may also appoint federal judges, U.S. ambassadors, consuls, ministers, and other officers of the United States with the advice and consent of the Senate. However, Congress may instead legislate for the appointment of particular inferior officials by the president, heads of executive departments, or the courts.\nThe Senate has a long-standing practice of permitting motions to reconsider previous decisions. In 1931, the Senate granted advice and consent to the president on the appointment of a member of the Federal Power Commission. The officer in question was sworn in, but the Senate, under the guise of a motion to reconsider, rescinded the advice and consent. In the \"quo warranto\" proceedings that followed, the Supreme Court ruled that the Senate was not permitted to rescind advice and consent after the officer had been installed.\nAfter the Senate grants advice and consent, however, the Supreme Court has ruled that the president is under no compulsion to commission the officer. It has not been settled whether the president has the prerogative to withhold a commission after having signed it. This issue played a large part in the seminal court case \"Marbury v. Madison\".\nAt times, the president has asserted the power to remove individuals from office. Congress has often explicitly limited the president's power to remove; during the Reconstruction era, Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act, proscribing, without the advice and consent of the Senate, presidential removal of anyone appointed with the advice and consent of the Senate. President Andrew Johnson ignored the Act, and was later impeached and acquitted. The constitutionality of the Act was not immediately settled. In \"Myers v. United States\", the Supreme Court held that Congress could not limit the president's power to remove an executive officer (the Postmaster General), but in \"Humphrey's Executor v. United States\", it upheld Congress's authority to restrict the president's power to remove officers of the Federal Trade Commission, an \"administrative body [that] cannot in any proper sense be characterized as an arm or an eye of the executive.\"\nCongress may repeal the legislation that authorizes the appointment of an executive officer. But according to the Supreme Court, it \"cannot reserve for itself the power of an officer charged with the execution of the laws except by impeachment.\"\nClause 3: Recess appointments.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.\nThe president may fill critical federal executive and judicial branch vacancies unilaterally but temporarily when the Senate is in recess, and thus unavailable to provide advice and consent. Such appointments expire at the end of the next Senate session. To continue to serve thereafter, the appointee must be formally nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.\nSection 3: Presidential responsibilities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient; he may, on extraordinary Occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them, and in Case of Disagreement between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment, he may adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper; he shall receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers; he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed, and shall Commission all the Officers of the United States.\nClause 1: State of the Union.\nThe president must give the Congress information on the \"State of the Union\" \"from time to time\". This is called the State of the Union Clause. Originally, presidents personally delivered annual addresses to Congress. Thomas Jefferson, who felt that the procedure resembled the speech from the throne delivered by British monarchs, chose instead to send written messages to Congress for reading by clerks. Jefferson's procedure was followed by future presidents until Woodrow Wilson reverted to the former procedure of personally addressing Congress, which has continued to this day[ [update]].\nKesavan and Sidak explain the purpose of the State of the Union clause:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The State of the Union Clause imposes an executive duty on the president. That duty must be discharged periodically. The president's assessment of the State of the Union must be publicized to Congress, and thus to the nation. The publication of the president's assessment conveys information to Congress\u2014information uniquely gleaned from the president's perspective in his various roles as commander-in-chief, chief law enforcer, negotiator with foreign powers, and the like\u2014that shall aid the legislature in public deliberation on matters that may justify the enactment of legislation because of their national importance.\nClause 2: Making recommendations to Congress.\nThe president has the power and duty to recommend, for the consideration of Congress, such measures which the president deems as \"necessary and expedient\". At his inauguration George Washington declared in his : \"By the article establishing the executive department it is made the duty of the president 'to recommend to your consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.'\" This is the Recommendation Clause.\nKesavan and Sidak explain the purpose of the Recommendation Clause:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSidak explained that there is a connection between the Recommendation Clause and the Petition Clause of the 1st Amendment: \"Through his performance of the duty to recommend measures to Congress, the president functions as the agent of a diffuse electorate who seek the redress of grievances. To muzzle the president, therefore, is to diminish the effectiveness of this right expressly reserved to the people under the first amendment.\" Kesavan and Sidak also cited a Professor Bybee who stated in this context: \"The Recommendation Clause empowers the president to represent the people before Congress, by recommending measures for the reform of government, for the general welfare, or for the redress of grievances. The Right of Petition Clause prevents Congress from abridging the right of the people to petition for a redress of grievances.\"\nThe Recommendation clause imposes a duty, but its performance rests solely with the president. Congress possesses no power to compel the president to recommend, as he alone is the \"judge\" of what is \"necessary and expedient\". Unlike the Necessary and Proper Clause of Article I, which limits Congress's discretion to carrying out only its delegated powers, the phrase \"necessary and expedient\" implies a wider range of discretion for the president. Because this is a political question, there has been little judicial involvement with the president's actions under the clause as long as presidents have not tried to extend their legislative powers. In \"Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer\" (1952), the Supreme Court noted that the Recommendations Clause serves as a reminder that the president cannot make law by himself: \"The power to recommend legislation, granted to the president, serves only to emphasize that it is his function to recommend and that it is the function of the Congress to legislate.\" The Court made a similar point in striking down the line-item veto in \"Clinton v. City of New York\" (1998). When President Bill Clinton attempted to shield the records of the President's Task Force on Health Care Reform as essential to his functions under the Recommendations Clause, a federal circuit court rejected the argument and noted in \"Association of American Physicians &amp; Surgeons v. Clinton\" (1993): \"[T]he Recommendation Clause is less an obligation than a right. The president has the undisputed authority to recommend legislation, but he need not exercise that authority with respect to any particular subject or, for that matter, any subject.\"\nClause 3: Extraordinary sessions and prorogation of Congress.\nTo allow the government to act quickly in case of a major domestic or international crisis arising when Congress is not in session, the president is empowered to call a special session of one or both houses of Congress. Since John Adams first did so in 1797, the president has called the full Congress to convene for a special session on 27 occasions. Harry Truman was the most recent to do so in July 1948 (the so called \"Turnip Day Session\"). Additionally, prior to ratification of the Twentieth Amendment (which brought forward the date on which Congress convenes from March to January) in 1933, newly inaugurated presidents would routinely call the Senate to meet to confirm nominations or ratify treaties. Clause 3 also authorizes the president to prorogue Congress if the House and Senate cannot agree on the time of adjournment; no president has ever had to exercise this administrative power. In 2020, President Donald Trump threatened to use this clause as a justification to prorogue both houses of Congress in order to make recess appointments during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, the President does not have the authority to do so unless either the Senate or the House of Representatives were to alter their scheduled adjournment dates.\nClause 4: Receiving foreign representatives.\nThe president receives all foreign ambassadors. This clause of the Constitution, known as the Reception Clause, has been interpreted to imply that the president possesses broad power over matters of foreign policy, and to provide support for the president's exclusive authority to grant recognition to a foreign government.\nClause 5: Caring for the faithful execution of the law.\nThe president must \"take care that the laws be faithfully executed\". This clause in the Constitution imposes a duty on the president to enforce the laws of the United States and is called the Take Care Clause, also known as the Faithful Execution Clause or Faithfully Executed Clause. This clause is meant to ensure that a law is faithfully executed by the president even if he disagrees with the purpose of that law. Addressing the North Carolina ratifying convention, William Maclaine declared that the Faithful Execution Clause was \"one of the [Constitution's] best provisions\". If the president \"takes care to see the laws faithfully executed, it will be more than is done in any government on the continent; for I will venture to say that our government, and those of the other states, are, with respect to the execution of the laws, in many respects mere ciphers.\" President George Washington interpreted this clause as imposing on him a unique duty to ensure the execution of federal law. Discussing a tax rebellion, Washington observed, \"it is my duty to see the Laws executed: to permit them to be trampled upon with impunity would be repugnant to [that duty].\"\nAccording to former United States assistant attorney general Walter E. Dellinger III, the Supreme Court and the attorneys general have long interpreted the Take Care Clause to mean that the president has no inherent constitutional authority to suspend the enforcement of the laws, particularly of statutes. The Take Care Clause demands that the president obey the law, the Supreme Court said in \"Humphrey's Executor v. United States\", and repudiates any notion that he may dispense with the law's execution. In \"Printz v. United States\", the Supreme Court explained how the president executes the law: \"The Constitution does not leave to speculation who is to administer the laws enacted by Congress; the president, it says, 'shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,' Art. II, \u00a73, personally and through officers whom he appoints (save for such inferior officers as Congress may authorize to be appointed by the 'Courts of Law' or by 'the Heads of Departments' with other presidential appointees), Art. II, \u00a72.\"\nThe president may not prevent a member of the executive branch from performing a ministerial duty lawfully imposed upon him by Congress. (See \"Marbury v. Madison\" (1803); and \"Kendall v. United States ex rel. Stokes\" (1838).) Nor may the president take an action not authorized either by the Constitution or by a lawful statute. (See \"Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer\" (1952).) Finally, the president may not refuse to enforce a constitutional law, or \"cancel\" certain appropriations, for that would amount to an extra-constitutional veto or suspension power.\nSome presidents have claimed the authority under this clause to impound money appropriated by Congress. President Jefferson, for example, delayed the expenditure of money appropriated for the purchase of gunboats for over a year. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his successors sometimes refused outright to expend appropriated money. The Supreme Court, however, has held that impoundments without Congressional authorization are unconstitutional.\nIt has been asserted that the president's responsibility in the \"faithful\" execution of the laws entitles him to suspend the privilege of the writ of \"habeas corpus\". Article One provides that the privilege may not be suspended save during times of rebellion or invasion, but it does not specify who may suspend the privilege. The Supreme Court ruled that Congress may suspend the privilege if it deems it necessary. During the American Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln suspended the privilege, but, owing to the vehement opposition he faced, obtained congressional authorization for the same. Since then, the privilege of the writ has only been suspended upon the express authorization of Congress, except in the case of Mary Surratt, whose writ was suspended by President Andrew Johnson regarding her alleged involvement in the assassination of President Lincoln.\nIn \"Mississippi v. Johnson\", 71 U.S. https:// (1867), the Supreme Court ruled that the judiciary may not restrain the president in the execution of the laws. In that case the Supreme Court refused to entertain a request for an injunction preventing President Andrew Johnson from executing the Reconstruction Acts, which were claimed to be unconstitutional. The Court found that \"[t]he Congress is the legislative department of the government; the president is the executive department. Neither can be restrained in its action by the judicial department; though the acts of both, when performed, are, in proper cases, subject to its cognizance.\" Thus, the courts cannot bar the passage of a law by Congress, though it may later strike down such a law as unconstitutional. A similar construction applies to the executive branch.\nClause 6: Officers' commissions.\nThe president commissions \"all the Officers of the United States\". These include officers in both military and foreign service. (Under Article I, Section 8, the States have authority for \"the Appointment of the Officers\u00a0... of the [State] Militia\u00a0...\")\nThe presidential authority to commission officers had a large impact on the 1803 case \"Marbury v. Madison\", where outgoing Federalist president John Adams feverishly signed many commissions to the judiciary on his final day in office, hoping to, as incoming Democratic-Republican president Thomas Jefferson put it, \"[retire] into the judiciary as a stronghold\". However, in his haste, Adams' secretary of State neglected to have all the commissions delivered. Incoming President Jefferson was enraged with Adams, and ordered his secretary of State, James Madison, to refrain from delivering the remaining commissions. William Marbury took the matter to the Supreme Court, where it held that the commissions were valid, and the courts generally had the power to order them delivered and should have done so (a ruling that established the principle of judicial review in the United States), but refused to issue the orders itself on the grounds that the law giving it original jurisdiction over such cases was unconstitutional.\nSection 4: Impeachment and removal from office of federal officials.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\nThe Constitution also allows for involuntary removal from office of the president, vice president, Cabinet secretaries, and other executive officers, as well as judges, who may be impeached by the House of Representatives and tried in the Senate.\nAny official convicted by the Senate is immediately removed from office, and to prevent the president's Article II appointment power from being used as a de facto pardon the Senate may also vote by a simple majority that the removed official be forever disqualified from holding any future office under the United States. Constitutional law expert Senator Matthew Carpenter reported that without the permanent disqualification clause impeachment would have no effect, because the President could simply reinstate his impeached officers \"the next morning\".\nWhile no other punishments may be inflicted pursuant to the impeachment proceeding, the convicted party remains liable to trial and punishment in the courts for civil and criminal charges.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31648", "revid": "19295592", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31648", "title": "Article Three of the United States Constitution", "text": "Portion of the US Constitution regarding the judicial branch\nArticle Three of the United States Constitution establishes the judicial branch of the U.S. federal government. Under Article Three, the judicial branch consists of the Supreme Court of the United States, as well as lower courts created by Congress. Article Three empowers the courts to handle cases or controversies arising under federal law, as well as other enumerated areas. Article Three also defines treason.\nSection 1 of Article Three vests the judicial power of the United States in \"one supreme Court\", as well as \"inferior courts\" established by Congress. Section 1 authorizes the creation of inferior courts, but does not require it; the first inferior federal courts were established shortly after the ratification of the Constitution with the Judiciary Act of 1789. Section 1 also establishes that federal judges do not face term limits, and that an individual judge's salary may not be decreased. Article Three does not set the size of the Supreme Court or establish specific positions on the court, but Article One establishes the position of chief justice. Along with the Vesting Clauses of Article One and Article Two, Article Three's Vesting Clause establishes the separation of powers among the three branches of government. \nSection 2 of Article Three delineates federal judicial power. The Case or Controversy Clause restricts the judiciary's power to actual cases and controversies, meaning that federal judicial power does not extend to cases which are hypothetical, or which are proscribed due to standing, mootness, or ripeness issues. Section 2 states that the federal judiciary's power extends to cases arising under the Constitution, federal laws, federal treaties, controversies involving multiple states or foreign powers, and other enumerated areas. Section 2 gives the Supreme Court original jurisdiction when ambassadors, public officials, or the states are a party in the case, leaving the Supreme Court with appellate jurisdiction in all other areas to which the federal judiciary's jurisdiction extends. Section 2 also gives Congress the power to strip the Supreme Court of appellate jurisdiction, and establishes that all federal crimes must be tried before a jury. Section 2 does not expressly grant the federal judiciary the power of judicial review, but the courts have exercised this power since the 1803 case of \"Marbury v. Madison\".\nSection 3 of Article Three defines treason and empowers Congress to punish treason. Section 3 requires that at least two witnesses testify to the treasonous act, or that the individual accused of treason confess in open court. It also limits the ways in which Congress can punish those convicted of treason.\nBackground.\nUnlike the Articles of Confederation, the US Constitution separated the legislative, executive and judicial powers. Article III separates and places the judicial power in the judiciary. This idea is most often attributed to Montesquieu. Although not the progenitor, Montesquieu's writing on the separation of power in \"The Spirit of Laws\" was immensely influential on the U.S. Constitution.\nSection 1: Federal courts.\nSection 1 is one of the three vesting clauses of the United States Constitution, which vests the judicial power of the United States in federal courts, requires the supreme court, allows inferior courts, requires good behavior tenure for judges, and prohibits decreasing the salaries of judges.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services a Compensation which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.\nThe Committee of Detail report reads slightly differently:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Judicial Power of the United States shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such Inferior Courts as shall, when necessary, from time to time, be constituted by the Legislature of the United States.\nClause 1: Vesting of judicial power and number of courts.\nArticle III authorizes one Supreme Court, but does not set the number of justices that must be appointed to it. refers to a \"chief justice\" (who shall preside over the impeachment trial of the president of the United States). After the Judiciary Act of 1869, the number of justices has been fixed at nine: one chief justice, and eight associate justices.\nProposals have been made at various times for organizing the Supreme Court into separate panels; none garnered wide support, and thus the constitutionality of such a division is unknown. In a 1937 letter to Senator Burton Wheeler during the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill debate, Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes wrote, \"the Constitution does not appear to authorize two or more Supreme Courts functioning in effect as separate courts.\"\nThe Supreme Court is the only federal court that is explicitly established by the Constitution. During the Constitutional Convention, a proposal was made for the Supreme Court to be the only federal court, having both original jurisdiction and appellate jurisdiction. This proposal was rejected in favor of the provision that exists today. The Supreme Court has interpreted this provision as enabling Congress to create inferior (i.e., lower) courts under both Article III, Section 1, and Article I, Section 8. The Article III courts, which are also known as \"constitutional courts\", were first created by the Judiciary Act of 1789, and are the only courts with judicial power. Article I courts, which are also known as \"legislative courts\", consist of regulatory agencies, such as the United States Tax Court.\nIn certain types of cases, Article III courts may exercise appellate jurisdiction over Article I courts. In \"Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land &amp; Improvement Co.\" (59 U.S. (18 How.) https:// (1856)), the Court held that \"there are legal matters, involving public rights, which may be presented in such form that the judicial power is capable of acting on them\", and which are susceptible to review by an Article III court. Later, in \"Ex parte Bakelite Corp.\" (279 U.S. https:// (1929)), the Court declared that Article I courts \"may be created as special tribunals to examine and determine various matters, arising between the government and others, which from their nature do not require judicial determination and yet are susceptible of it.\" Other cases, such as bankruptcy cases, have been held not to involve judicial determination, and may therefore go before Article I courts. Similarly, several courts in the District of Columbia, which is under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Congress, are Article I courts rather than Article III courts. This article was expressly extended to the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico by the U.S. Congress through Federal Law 89-571, 80 Stat. 764, signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1966. This transformed the article IV United States territorial court in Puerto Rico, created in 1900, to an Article III federal judicial district court.\nThe Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937, frequently called the court-packing plan, was a legislative initiative to add more justices to the Supreme Court proposed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt shortly after his victory in the 1936 presidential election. Although the bill aimed generally to overhaul and modernize the entire federal court system, its central and most controversial provision would have granted the President power to appoint an additional justice to the Supreme Court for every incumbent justice over the age of 70, up to a maximum of six.\nThe Constitution is silent when it comes to judges of courts which have been abolished. The Judiciary Act of 1801 increased the number of courts to permit Federalist president John Adams to appoint a number of Federalist judges before Thomas Jefferson took office. When Jefferson became president, the Congress abolished several of these courts and made no provision for the judges of those courts. The Judicial Code of 1911 abolished circuit riding and transferred the circuit courts authority and jurisdiction to the district courts.\nClause 2: Tenure.\nThe Constitution provides that judges \"shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour\". The term \"good behaviour\" is interpreted to mean that judges may serve for the remainder of their lives, although they may resign or retire voluntarily. A judge may also be removed by impeachment and conviction by congressional vote (hence the term \"good\" behavior); this has occurred fourteen times. Three other judges \u2013 Mark W. Delahay, George W. English, and Samuel B. Kent \u2013 chose to resign rather than go through the impeachment process.\nClause 3: Salaries.\nThe compensation of judges may be increased, but not decreased, during their continuance in office. However, Congress may alter a promised future increase before it becomes effective. Thus, in \"United States v. Will\", the court held that Congress could repeal or modify a statutorily defined formula for annual cost-of-living increases to the compensation of federal judges, but Congress must act with respect to any particular increase before the increase takes effect.\nSection 2: Judicial power, jurisdiction, and trial by jury.\nSection 2 delineates federal judicial power, and brings that power into execution by conferring original jurisdiction and also appellate jurisdiction upon the Supreme Court. Additionally, this section requires trial by jury in all criminal cases, except impeachment cases.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority;\u2014to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls;\u2014to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction;\u2014to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party;\u2014to Controversies between two or more States;\u2014between a State and Citizens of another State;\u2014between Citizens of different States;\u2014between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects.\nIn all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party, the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction. In all the other Cases before mentioned, the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.\nTrial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed.\nClause 1: Cases and controversies.\nClause 1 of Section 2 authorizes the federal courts to hear actual cases and controversies only. Their judicial power does not extend to cases which are hypothetical, or which are proscribed due to standing, mootness, or ripeness issues. Generally, a case or controversy requires the presence of adverse parties who have a genuine interest at stake in the case. In \"Muskrat v. United States\", 219 U.S. https:// (1911), the Supreme Court denied jurisdiction to cases brought under a statute permitting certain Native Americans to bring suit against the United States to determine the constitutionality of a law allocating tribal lands. Counsel for both sides were to be paid from the federal Treasury. The Supreme Court held that, though the United States was a defendant, the case in question was not an actual controversy; rather, the statute was merely devised to test the constitutionality of a certain type of legislation. Thus the Court's ruling would be nothing more than an advisory opinion; therefore, the court dismissed the suit for failing to present a \"case or controversy.\"\nA significant omission is that although Clause 1 provides that federal judicial power shall extend to \"the laws of the United States,\" it does not also provide that it shall extend to the laws of the \"several\" or individual states. In turn, the Judiciary Act of 1789 and subsequent acts never granted the U.S. Supreme Court the power to review decisions of state supreme courts on pure issues of state law. It is this silence which tacitly made state supreme courts the final expositors of the common law in their respective states. They were free to diverge from English precedents and from each other on the vast majority of legal issues which had never been made part of federal law by the Constitution, and the U.S. Supreme Court could do nothing, as it would ultimately concede in \"Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins\" (1938). By way of contrast, other English-speaking federations like Australia and Canada never adopted the \"Erie\" doctrine. That is, their highest courts have always possessed plenary power to impose a uniform nationwide common law upon all lower courts and never adopted the strong American distinction between federal and state common law.\nEleventh Amendment and state sovereign immunity.\nIn \"Chisholm v. Georgia\", 2 U.S. https:// (1793), the Supreme Court ruled that Article III, Section 2 abrogated the states' sovereign immunity and authorized federal courts to hear disputes between private citizens and States. This decision was overturned by the Eleventh Amendment, which was passed by the Congress on March 4, 1794, 1\u00a0Stat.\u00a0https:// and ratified by the states on February 7, 1795. It prohibits the federal courts from hearing \"any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State\".\nClause 2: Original and appellate jurisdiction.\nClause 2 of Section 2 provides that the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in cases affecting ambassadors, ministers and consuls, and also in those controversies which are subject to federal judicial power because at least one state is a party; the Court has held that the latter requirement is met if the United States has a controversy with a state. In other cases, the Supreme Court has only appellate jurisdiction, which may be regulated by the Congress. The Congress may not, however, amend the Court's original jurisdiction, as was found in \"Marbury v. Madison\", 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) https:// (1803) (the same decision which established the principle of judicial review). \"Marbury\" held that Congress can neither expand nor restrict the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. However, the appellate jurisdiction of the Court is different. The Court's appellate jurisdiction is given \"with such exceptions, and under such regulations as the Congress shall make.\" By this clause, the Supreme Court upheld in 1869 that a former Confederate soldier could not appeal his suit for a writ of \"habeas corpus\" to that Court, because Congress had exempted such suits from its appellate jurisdiction, in \"Ex parte McCardle\".\nOften a court will assert a modest degree of power over a case for the threshold purpose of determining whether it has jurisdiction, and so the word \"power\" is not necessarily synonymous with the word \"jurisdiction\".\nJudicial review.\nThe power of the federal judiciary to review the constitutionality of a statute or treaty, or to review an administrative regulation for consistency with either a statute, a treaty, or the Constitution itself, is an implied power derived in part from Clause 2 of Section 2.\nThough the Constitution does not expressly provide that the federal judiciary has the power of judicial review, many of the Constitution's Framers viewed such a power as an appropriate power for the federal judiciary to possess. In \"Federalist No. 78\", Alexander Hamilton wrote,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHamilton goes on to counterbalance the tone of \"judicial supremacists,\" those demanding that both Congress and the executive are compelled by the Constitution to enforce all court decisions, including those that, in their eyes, or those of the People, violate fundamental American principles:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Marbury v. Madison\" involved a highly partisan set of circumstances. Though congressional elections were held in November 1800, the newly elected officers did not take power until March. The Federalist Party had lost the elections. In the words of President Thomas Jefferson, the Federalists \"retired into the judiciary as a stronghold\". In the four months following the elections, the outgoing Congress created several new judgeships, which were filled by President John Adams. In the last-minute rush, however, Federalist secretary of state John Marshall had neglected to deliver 17 of the commissions to their respective appointees. When James Madison took office as Secretary of State, several commissions remained undelivered. Bringing their claims under the Judiciary Act of 1789, the appointees, including William Marbury, petitioned the Supreme Court for the issue of a writ of mandamus, which in English law had been used to force public officials to fulfill their ministerial duties. Here, Madison would be required to deliver the commissions.\n\"Marbury\" posed a difficult problem for the court, which was then led by Chief Justice John Marshall, the same person who had neglected to deliver the commissions when he was the Secretary of State. If Marshall's court commanded James Madison to deliver the commissions, Madison might ignore the order, thereby indicating the weakness of the court. Similarly, if the court denied William Marbury's request, the court would be seen as weak. Marshall held that appointee Marbury was indeed entitled to his commission. However, Justice Marshall contended that the Judiciary Act of 1789 was unconstitutional, since it purported to grant original jurisdiction to the Supreme Court in cases not involving the States or ambassadors. The ruling thereby established that the federal courts could exercise judicial review over the actions of Congress or the executive branch.\nHowever, Alexander Hamilton, in \"Federalist No. 78\", expressed the view that the Courts hold only the power of words, and not the power of compulsion upon those other two branches of government, upon which the Supreme Court is itself dependent. Then in 1820, Thomas Jefferson expressed his deep reservations about the doctrine of judicial review:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nClause 3: Federal trials.\nClause 3 of Section 2 provides that federal crimes, except impeachment cases, must be tried before a jury, unless the defendant waives their right. Also, the trial must be held in the state where the crime was committed. If the crime was not committed in any particular state, then the trial is held in such a place as set forth by the Congress. The United States Senate has the sole power to try impeachment cases.\nTwo of the constitutional amendments that comprise the Bill of Rights contain related provisions. The Sixth Amendment enumerates the rights of individuals when facing criminal prosecution and the Seventh Amendment establishes an individual's right to a jury trial in certain civil cases. It also inhibits courts from overturning a jury's findings of fact. The Supreme Court has extended the right to a jury in the Sixth Amendment to individuals facing trial in state courts through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, but has refused to do so with the Seventh.\nSection 3: Treason.\nSection 3 defines treason and limits its punishment.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.\nThe Congress shall have Power to declare the Punishment of Treason, but no Attainder of Treason shall work Corruption of Blood, or Forfeiture except during the Life of the Person attainted.\nThe Constitution defines treason as specific acts, namely \"levying War against [the United States], or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort.\" A contrast is therefore maintained with the English law, whereby crimes including conspiring to kill the king or \"violating\" the queen, were punishable as treason. In \"Ex Parte Bollman\", 8 U.S. https:// (1807), the Supreme Court ruled that \"there must be an actual assembling of men, for the treasonable purpose, to constitute a levying of war.\"\nUnder English law effective during the ratification of the U.S. Constitution, there were several species of treason. Of these, the Constitution adopted only two: levying war and adhering to enemies. Omitted were species of treason involving encompassing (or imagining) the death of the king, certain types of counterfeiting, and finally fornication with women in the royal family of the sort which could call into question the parentage of royal successors. James Wilson wrote the original draft of this section, and he was involved as a defense attorney for some accused of treason against the Patriot cause. The two forms of treason adopted were both derived from the English Treason Act 1351. Joseph Story wrote in his \"Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States\" of the authors of the Constitution that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;they have adopted the very words of the Statute of Treason of Edward the Third; and thus by implication, in order to cut off at once all chances of arbitrary constructions, they have recognized the well-settled interpretation of these phrases in the administration of criminal law, which has prevailed for ages.\nIn \"Federalist\" No. 43 James Madison wrote regarding the Treason Clause:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As treason may be committed against the United States, the authority of the United States ought to be enabled to punish it. But as new-fangled and artificial treasons have been the great engines by which violent factions, the natural offspring of free government, have usually wreaked their alternate malignity on each other, the convention have, with great judgment, opposed a barrier to this peculiar danger, by inserting a constitutional definition of the crime, fixing the proof necessary for conviction of it, and restraining the Congress, even in punishing it, from extending the consequences of guilt beyond the person of its author.\nBased on the above quotation, it was noted by the lawyer William J. Olson in an \"amicus curiae\" in the case \"Hedges v. Obama\" that the Treason Clause was one of the enumerated powers of the federal government. He also stated that by defining treason in the U.S. Constitution and placing it in Article III \"the founders intended the power to be checked by the judiciary, ruling out trials by military commissions. As James Madison noted, the Treason Clause also was designed to limit the power of the federal government to punish its citizens for 'adhering to [the] enemies [of the United States by], giving them aid and comfort.'\"\nSection 3 also requires the testimony of two different witnesses on the same overt act, or a confession by the accused in open court, to convict for treason. This rule was derived from another English statute, the Treason Act 1695. The English law did not require both witnesses to have witnessed the same overt act; this requirement, supported by Benjamin Franklin, was added to the draft Constitution by a vote of 8 states to 3.\nIn \"Cramer v. United States\", 325 U.S. https:// (1945), the Supreme Court ruled that \"[e]very act, movement, deed, and word of the defendant charged to constitute treason must be supported by the testimony of two witnesses.\" In \"Haupt v. United States\", 330 U.S. https:// (1947), however, the Supreme Court found that two witnesses are not required to prove intent, nor are two witnesses required to prove that an overt act is treasonable. The two witnesses, according to the decision, are required to prove only that the overt act occurred (eyewitnesses and federal agents investigating the crime, for example).\nPunishment for treason may not \"work Corruption of Blood, or Forfeiture except during the Life of the Person\" so convicted. The descendants of someone convicted for treason could not, as they were under English law, be considered \"tainted\" by the treason of their ancestor.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It also empowers Congress to admit new states and administer the territories and other federal lands.\nThe Full Faith and Credit Clause requires states to extend \"full faith and credit\" to the public acts, records, and court proceedings of other states. The Supreme Court has held that this clause prevents states from reopening cases that have been conclusively decided by the courts of another state. The Privileges and Immunities Clause requires interstate protection of \"privileges and immunities,\" preventing each state from treating citizens of other states in a discriminatory manner. The Extradition Clause requires that fugitives from justice be extradited on the demand of executive authority of the state from which they flee. Since the 1987 case of \"Puerto Rico v. Branstad\", federal courts may also use the Extradition Clause to require the extradition of fugitives. The Fugitive Slave Clause requires the return of fugitive slaves; this clause was rendered moot by the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished involuntary servitude, except in the prison system.\nThe Admissions Clause grants Congress the authority to admit new states but forbids the creation of new states from parts of existing states without the consent of the affected states. While the Admissions Clause does not expressly include the requirement that all states to be admitted on an equal footing, the Supreme Court has held that it is a constitutional requirement. The Property Clause grants Congress the power to make laws for the territories and other federal lands. The Guarantee Clause mandates that the United States guarantee that all states have a \"republican form of government,\" though it does not define this term. Article Four also requires the United States to protect each state from invasion, and, at the request of a state, from \"domestic violence.\"\nSection 1: Full faith and credit.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State.

Congress may regulate the manner in which proof of such acts, records, or proceedings may be admitted.\nIn \"Mills v. Duryee\", 1t1 U.S. (7 Cranch) https:// (1813), the United States Supreme Court ruled that the merits of a case, as settled by courts of one state, must be recognized by the courts of other states; state courts may not reopen cases which have been conclusively decided by the courts of another state. Later, Chief Justice John Marshall suggested that the judgment of one state court must be recognized by other states' courts as final. In \"McElmoyle v. Cohen\", 38 U.S. (13 Pet.) https:// (1839), the court heard a case where one party obtained a judgment in South Carolina and sought to enforce it in Georgia, which had a statute of limitations that barred actions on judgments after a certain amount of time had passed since the judgment was entered. The court upheld Georgia's refusal to enforce the South Carolina judgment. The court found that out-of-state judgments are subject to the procedural law of the states where they are enforced, notwithstanding any priority accorded in the states in which they are issued.\nSection 2: Rights of state citizens; rights of extradition.\nClause 1: Privileges and Immunities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.\nClause One of Section 2 requires interstate protection of \"privileges and immunities\". The seeming ambiguity of the clause has given rise to a number of different interpretations. Some contend that the clause requires Congress to treat all citizens equally. Others suggest that citizens of states carry the rights accorded by their home states while traveling in other states.\nNeither of these theories has been endorsed by the Supreme Court, which has held that the clause means that a state may not discriminate against citizens of other states in favor of its own citizens. In \"Corfield v. Coryell\", 6 F. Cas. 546 (C.C.E.D. Pa. 1823), the federal circuit court held that privileges and immunities in respect of which discrimination is barred include \nprotection by the Government; the enjoyment of life and liberty ... the right of a citizen of one State to pass through, or to reside in any other State, for purposes of trade, agriculture, professional pursuits, or otherwise; to claim the benefits of the writ of habeas corpus; to institute and maintain actions of any kind in the courts of the State; to take, hold and dispose of property, either real or personal; and an exemption from higher taxes or impositions than are paid by the other citizens of the State.\nMost other benefits were held not to be protected privileges and immunities. In \"Corfield,\" the circuit court sustained a New Jersey law giving state residents the exclusive right to gather clams and oysters.\nClause 2: Extradition of fugitives.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A Person charged in any State with Treason, Felony, or other Crime, who shall flee from Justice, and be found in another State, shall on demand of the executive Authority of the State from which he fled, be delivered up, to be removed to the State having Jurisdiction of the Crime.\nClause Two requires that fugitives from justice may be extradited on the demand of executive authority of the state from which they fled. The Supreme Court has held that it is not compulsory for the fugitive to have fled after an indictment was issued, but only that the fugitive fled after having committed the crime. The Constitution provides for the extradition of fugitives who have committed \"treason, felony or other crime.\" That phrase incorporates all acts prohibited by the laws of a state, including misdemeanors and small, or petty, offenses.\nIn \"Kentucky v. Dennison\" (1860), the Supreme Court held that the federal courts may not compel state governors to surrender fugitives through the issue of writs of mandamus. The \"Dennison\" decision was overruled by \"Puerto Rico v. Branstad\" (1987); now, the federal courts may require the extradition of fugitives. Alleged fugitives generally may not challenge extradition proceedings.\nThe motives of the governor demanding the extradition may not be questioned. The accused cannot defend himself against the charges in the extraditing state; the fugitive must do so in the state receiving him. However, the accused may prevent extradition by offering clear evidence that he was not in the state he allegedly fled from at the time of the crime. There is no constitutional requirement that extradited fugitives be tried only for the crimes named in the extradition proceedings.\nFugitives brought to states by means other than extradition may be tried, even though the means of the conveyance was unlawful; the Supreme Court so ruled in \"Mahon v. Justice\", 127 U.S. https:// (1888). In \"Mahon\" a body of armed men from Kentucky forcibly took, without a warrant, a man in West Virginia to bring him back to Kentucky for formal arrest and trial.\nClause 3: Fugitive Slave Clause.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;No Person held to Service or Labour in one State, under the Laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in Consequence of any Law or Regulation therein, be discharged from such Service or Labour, but shall be delivered up on Claim of the Party to whom such Service or Labour may be due.\nPierce Butler and Charles Pinckney, both from South Carolina, submitted this clause to the Constitutional Convention. James Wilson of Pennsylvania objected, stating it would require that state governments enforce slavery at taxpayers' expense. Butler withdrew the clause. The next day the clause was reinstated and adopted by the Convention without objection. This clause was added to the clause that provided extradition for fugitives from justice.\nWhen first adopted, this clause applied to fugitive slaves and required that they be extradited upon the claims of their masters, but it provided no means for doing so. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 created the mechanism for recovering a fugitive slave, overruled any state laws giving sanctuary, made it a federal crime to assist an escaped slave, and allowed slave-catchers into every U.S. state and territory. As free states sought to undermine the federal law, the even more severe Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 was enacted.\nIn 1864, during the Civil War, an effort to repeal this clause of the Constitution failed. The vote in the House was 69 for repeal and 38 against, which was short of the two-to-one vote required to amend the Constitution. This clause was rendered mostly moot when the Thirteenth Amendment abolished involuntary servitude.\nSection 3: New states and federal property.\nClause 1: Admission of new states.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;New States may be admitted by the Congress into this Union; but no new States shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any other State; nor any State be formed by the Junction of two or more States, or parts of States, without the Consent of the Legislatures of the States concerned as well as of the Congress.\nThe First Clause of Section Three, also known as the \"Admissions Clause\", grants to Congress the authority to admit new states into the Union. Since the establishment of the United States in 1776, the number of states has expanded from the original 13 to 50. It also forbids the creation of new states from parts of existing states without the consent of the affected states legislature and Congress. This latter provision was designed to give Eastern states that still had claims to Western lands (e.g., Virginia and North Carolina) to have a veto over whether their western counties (which eventually became Kentucky and Tennessee) could become states. It would later be applied with regard to the formation of Maine (from Massachusetts) and West Virginia (from Virginia).\nAt the 1787 Constitutional Convention, a proposal to include the phrase, \"new States shall be admitted on the same terms with the original States\", was defeated. It was feared that the political power of future new western states would eventually overwhelm that of the established eastern states. Once the new Constitution went into effect, however, Congress admitted Vermont and Kentucky on equal terms and thereafter formalized the condition in its acts of admission for subsequent states, declaring that the new state enters \"on an equal footing with the original States in all respects whatever.\" Thus the Congress, utilizing the discretion allowed by the framers, adopted a policy of equal status for all newly admitted states. With the growth of states' rights advocacy during the antebellum period, the Supreme Court ruled, in \"Lessee of Pollard v. Hagan\" (1845), that the Constitution mandated admission of new states on the basis of equality.\nCongressional restrictions on the equality of states, even when those limitations have been found in the acts of admission, have been held void by the Supreme Court. For instance the Supreme Court struck down a provision which limited the jurisdiction of the state of Alabama over navigable waters within the state. The Court held, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Alabama is, therefore, entitled to the sovereignty and jurisdiction over all the territory within her limits ... to maintain any other doctrine, is to deny that Alabama has been admitted into the union on an equal footing with the original states ... to Alabama belong the navigable waters and soils under them. The doctrine can also be applied to the detriment of states, as occurred with Texas. Before admission to the Union, Texas, as an independent nation, controlled water within three miles of the coast, the normal limit for nations. Under the equal footing doctrine, Texas was found not to have control over the three-mile belt after admission into the Union, because the original states did not at the time of joining the union control such waters. Instead, by entering the Union, Texas was found to have surrendered control over the water and the soil under it to Congress. Under the Submerged Lands Act of 1953, Congress returned maritime territory to some states, but not to others; the Act was sustained by the Supreme Court.\nThe constitution does not state whether a state may unilaterally leave, or secede from, the Union. However, the Supreme Court, in \"Texas v. White\" (1869), held that a state cannot unilaterally do so.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When, therefore, Texas became one of the United States, she entered into an indissoluble relation. All the obligations of perpetual union, and all the guaranties of republican government in the Union, attached at once to the State. The act which consummated her admission into the Union was something more than a compact; it was the incorporation of a new member into the political body. And it was final. The union between Texas and the other States was as complete, as perpetual, and as indissoluble as the union between the original States. There was no place for reconsideration, or revocation, except through revolution, or through consent of the States.\nClause 2: Property Clause.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to Prejudice any Claims of the United States, or of any particular State.\nThis clause, commonly known as the \"Property Clause\" or \"Territorial Clause\", grants Congress the constitutional authority for the management and control of all territories or other property owned by the United States. The clause also proclaims that nothing contained within the Constitution may be interpreted to harm (prejudice) any claim of the United States, or of any particular State. The exact scope of this clause has long been a matter of debate.\nThe federal government owns about twenty-eight percent of the land in the United States. These holdings include national parks, national forests, recreation areas, wildlife refuges, vast tracts of range and public lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management, reservations held in trust for Native American tribes, military bases, and ordinary federal buildings and installations. Federal property can be found in every state, and the largest concentrations are in the Western United States, where, for example, the federal government owns over eighty percent of the land within Nevada.\nPursuant to a parallel clause in , the Supreme Court has held that states may not tax such federal property. In another case, \"Kleppe v. New Mexico\", the Court ruled that the federal Wild Horse and Burro Act was a constitutional exercise of congressional power under the Property Clause\u00a0\u2013 at least insofar as it was applied to a finding of trespass. The case prohibited the entering upon the public lands of the United States and removing wild burros under the New Mexico Estray Law.\nA major issue early in the 20th century was whether the whole Constitution applied to the territories called insular areas by Congress. In a series of opinions by the Supreme Court of the United States, referred to as the Insular Cases, the Court ruled that the territories belonged to, but were not part of the United States. Therefore, under the Territorial clause, Congress had the power to determine which parts of the Constitution applied to the territories. These rulings have helped shape public opinion among Puerto Ricans during the ongoing debate over the commonwealth's political status.\nSection 4: Obligations of the United States.\nClause 1: Republican government.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government, [...]\nThis clause, sometimes referred to as the Guarantee Clause, has long been at the forefront of the debate about the rights of citizens vis-\u00e0-vis the government. The Guarantee Clause mandates that all U.S. states must be grounded in republican principles such as the consent of the governed. By ensuring that all states must have the same basic republican philosophy, the Guarantee Clause is one of several portions of the Constitution which mandates symmetric federalism between the states.\nThe Constitution does not explain what exactly constitutes a republican form of government. There are, however, several places within it where the principles behind the concept are articulated. Article Seven, the last and shortest of the Constitution's original articles, stipulated that the Constitution, before it could become established as the \"Law of the Land\", must obtain the consent of the people by being ratified by popular conventions within the several states. Additionally, as it required the ratification of nine states in order to become established, rather than the unanimous consent required by the Articles of Confederation, the Constitution was more republican, as it protected the majority from effectively being ruled or held captive by the minority.\n\"The Federalist Papers\" also gives some insight as to the intent of the Founders. A republican form of government is distinguished from a direct democracy, which the Founding Fathers had no intentions of entering. As James Madison wrote in Federalist No. 10, \"Hence it is that such democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths.\"\nA political crisis in 1840s Rhode Island, the Dorr Rebellion, forced the Supreme Court to rule on the meaning of this clause. At the time, the Rhode Island constitution was the old royal charter established in the 17th century. By the 1840s, 40% of the state's free white males were enfranchised. An attempt to hold a popular convention to write a new constitution was declared insurrection by the charter government, and the convention leaders were arrested. One of them brought suit in federal court, arguing that Rhode Island's government was not \"republican\" in character, and that his arrest (along with all of the government's other acts) was invalid. In \"Luther v. Borden\", the Court held that the determination of whether a state government is a legitimate republican form as guaranteed by the Constitution is a political question to be resolved by the Congress. In effect, the court held the clause to be nonjusticiable.\nThe \"Luther v. Borden\" ruling left the responsibility to establish guidelines for the republican nature of state governments in the hands of the Congress. This power became an important part of Reconstruction after the American Civil War. The Radical Republican majority used this clause as the basis for taking control of the ex-Confederate states and for promoting civil rights for freedmen, plus the limiting of political and voting rights for ex-Confederates, abolishing the ex-Confederate state governments, setting guidelines for the readmission of the rebellious states into the Union.\nIn 1912, \"Luther\" was reaffirmed in \"Pacific States Telephone and Telegraph Co. v. Oregon\". In \"Pacific States\", a utility company challenged an Oregon tax law passed by a referendum, as opposed to the ordinary legislative process. The utility company claimed that the use of referendums, as a form of direct democracy, violated the republican form of government clause, which permits only a representative democracy. The court rejected the challenge, finding the challenge to have presented a nonjusticiable political question that only Congress can resolve. \nThe doctrine was later limited in \"Baker v. Carr\" (1962), which held that the lack of state legislative redistricting to be justiciable. \nThe Supreme Court's holding in \"Luther v. Borden\" still holds today. The Court, by looking to the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (adopted 19 years after \"Luther v. Borden\" was decided), has developed new criteria for determining which questions are political in nature and which are justiciable.\nClause 2: Protection from invasion and domestic violence.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[...] and [the United States] shall protect each of them [the States] against Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened) against domestic Violence.\nSection Four requires the United States to protect each state from invasion, and, upon the application of the state legislature (or executive, if the legislature cannot be convened), from domestic violence. This provision was invoked by Colorado governor Elias M. Ammons in 1914 during the Colorado Coalfield War, as a result of which President Woodrow Wilson sent federal troops to the state.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31650", "revid": "473822", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31650", "title": "Article Five of the United States Constitution", "text": "Description of amendment procedure\nArticle Five of the United States Constitution describes the procedure for altering the Constitution. Under Article Five, the process to alter the Constitution consists of proposing an amendment or amendments, and subsequent ratification.\nAmendments may be proposed either by the Congress with a two-thirds vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate; or by a convention to propose amendments called by Congress at the request of two-thirds of the state legislatures. To become part of the Constitution, an amendment must then be ratified by either\u2014as determined by Congress\u2014the legislatures of three-quarters of the states or by ratifying conventions conducted in three-quarters of the states, a process utilized only once thus far in American history with the 1933 ratification of the Twenty-First Amendment. The vote of each state (to either ratify or reject a proposed amendment) carries equal weight, regardless of a state's population or length of time in the Union. Article Five is silent regarding deadlines for the ratification of proposed amendments, but most amendments proposed since 1917 have included a deadline for ratification. Legal scholars generally agree that the amending process of Article Five can itself be amended by the procedures laid out in Article Five, but there is some disagreement over whether Article Five is the exclusive means of amending the Constitution.\nIn addition to defining the procedures for altering the Constitution, Article Five also shields three clauses in Article One from ordinary amendment by attaching stipulations. Regarding two of the clauses\u2014one concerning importation of slaves and the other apportionment of direct taxes\u2014the prohibition on amendment was absolute but of limited duration, expiring in 1808; the third was without an expiration date but less absolute: \"no state, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate.\" Scholars disagree as to whether this shielding clause can itself be amended by the procedures laid out in Article Five.\nText.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress; Provided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first and fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first Article; and that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate.\nProcedures for amending the Constitution.\nThirty-three amendments to the United States Constitution have been approved by the Congress and sent to the states for ratification. Twenty-seven of these amendments have been ratified and are now part of the Constitution. The first ten amendments were adopted and ratified simultaneously and are known collectively as the Bill of Rights. Six amendments adopted by Congress and sent to the states have not been ratified by the required number of states and are not part of the Constitution. Four of these amendments are still technically open and pending, one is closed and has failed by its own terms, and one is closed and has failed by the terms of the resolution proposing it. All totaled, more than 10,000 measures to amend the Constitution have been proposed in Congress.\nProposing amendments.\nArticle V provides two methods for amending the nation's frame of government. The first method authorizes Congress, \"whenever two-thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary,\" to propose constitutional amendments. The second method requires Congress, \"on the application of the legislatures of two-thirds of the several states\" (34 as of 1959[ [update]]), to \"call a convention for proposing amendments\".\nThis duality in Article V is the result of compromises made during the 1787 Constitutional Convention between two groups, one maintaining that the national legislature should have no role in the constitutional amendment process and another contending that proposals to amend the constitution should originate in the national legislature and their ratification should be decided by state legislatures or state conventions. Regarding the consensus amendment process crafted during the convention, James Madison (writing in The Federalist No. 43) declared: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEach time the Article V process has been initiated since 1789, the first method for crafting and proposing amendments has been used. All 33 amendments submitted to the states for ratification originated in Congress. The second method, the convention option, a political tool that Alexander Hamilton (writing in the Federalist No. 85) argued would enable state legislatures to \"erect barriers against the encroachments of the national authority,\" has yet to be invoked.\nWhen the 1st Congress considered a series of constitutional amendments, it was suggested that the two houses first adopt a resolution indicating that they deemed amendments necessary. This procedure was not used. Instead, both the House and the Senate proceeded directly to consideration of a joint resolution, thereby implying that both bodies deemed amendments to be necessary. Also, when initially proposed by James Madison, the amendments were designed to be interwoven into the relevant sections of the original document. Instead, they were approved by Congress and sent to the states for ratification as supplemental additions (codicils) appended to it. Both these precedents have been followed ever since.\nOnce approved by Congress, the joint resolution proposing a constitutional amendment does not require presidential approval before it goes out to the states. While Article I Section 7 provides that all federal legislation must, before becoming Law, be presented to the president for his or her signature or veto, Article V provides no such requirement for constitutional amendments approved by Congress or by a federal convention. Thus, the president has no official function in the process. In \"Hollingsworth v. Virginia\" (1798), the Supreme Court affirmed that it is not necessary to place constitutional amendments before the president for approval or veto.\nThree times in the 20th century, concerted efforts were undertaken by proponents of particular amendments to secure the number of applications necessary to summon an Article V Convention. These included conventions to consider amendments to (1) provide for the popular election of U.S. Senators; (2) permit the states to include factors other than equality of population in drawing state legislative district boundaries; and (3) to propose an amendment requiring the U.S. budget to be balanced under most circumstances. The campaign for a popularly elected Senate is frequently credited with \"prodding\" the Senate to join the House of Representatives in proposing what became the Seventeenth Amendment to the states in 1912, while the latter two campaigns came very close to meeting the two-thirds threshold in the 1960s and 1980s, respectively.\nRatification of amendments.\nAfter being officially proposed, either by Congress or a national convention of the states, a constitutional amendment must then be ratified by three-fourths (38 out of 50) of the states. Congress is authorized to choose whether a proposed amendment is sent to the state legislatures or to state ratifying conventions for ratification. Amendments ratified by the states under either procedure are indistinguishable and have equal validity as part of the Constitution. Of the 33 amendments submitted to the states for ratification, the state convention method has been used for only one, the Twenty-first Amendment. In \"United States v. Sprague\" (1931), the Supreme Court affirmed the authority of Congress to decide which mode of ratification will be used for each individual constitutional amendment. The Court had earlier, in \"Hawke v. Smith\" (1920), upheld the Ohio General Assembly's ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment\u2014which Congress had sent to the state legislatures for ratification\u2014after Ohio voters successfully vetoed that approval through a popular referendum, ruling that a provision in the Ohio Constitution reserving to the state's voters the right to challenge and overturn its legislature's ratification of federal constitutional amendments was unconstitutional.\nAn amendment becomes an operative part of the Constitution when it is ratified by the necessary number of states, rather than on the later date when its ratification is certified. No further action by Congress or anyone is required. On three occasions, Congress has, after being informed that an amendment has reached the ratification threshold, adopted a resolution declaring the process successfully completed. Such actions, while perhaps important for political reasons, are, constitutionally speaking, unnecessary.\nThe archivist of the United States is charged with responsibility for administering the ratification process under the provisions of 1 U.S. Code https://. The archivist officially notifies the states, by a registered letter to each state's Governor, that an amendment has been proposed. Each Governor then formally submits the amendment to their state's legislature (or ratifying convention). When a state ratifies a proposed amendment, it sends the archivist an original or certified copy of the state's action. Upon receiving the necessary number of state ratifications, it is the duty of the archivist to issue a certificate proclaiming a particular amendment duly ratified and part of the Constitution. The amendment and its certificate of ratification are then published in the \"Federal Register\" and \"United States Statutes at Large\". This serves as official notice to Congress and to the nation that the ratification process has been successfully completed.\nThis process, argues Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, means the U.S. Constitution is the most difficult in the world to amend \"by a lot\".\nRatification deadline and extension.\nThe Constitution is silent on the issue of whether or not Congress may limit the length of time that the states have to ratify constitutional amendments sent for their consideration. It is also silent on the issue of whether or not Congress, once it has sent an amendment that includes a ratification deadline to the states for their consideration, can extend that deadline.\nDeadlines.\nThe practice of limiting the time available to the states to ratify proposed amendments began in 1917 with the Eighteenth Amendment. All amendments proposed since then, with the exception of the Nineteenth Amendment and the (still pending) Child Labor Amendment, have included a deadline, either in the body of the proposed amendment, or in the joint resolution transmitting it to the states. The ratification deadline \"clock\" begins running on the day final action is completed in Congress. An amendment may be ratified at any time after final congressional action, even if the states have not yet been officially notified.\nIn \"Dillon v. Gloss\" (1921), the Supreme Court upheld Congress's power to prescribe time limitations for state ratifications and intimated that clearly out of date proposals were no longer open for ratification. Granting that it found nothing express in Article V relating to time constraints, the Court yet allowed that it found\u2014intimated in the amending process\u2014a \"strongly suggest[ive]\" argument that proposed amendments are not open to ratification for all time or by States acting at widely separate times. The court subsequently, in \"Coleman v. Miller\" (1939), modified its opinion considerably. In that case, related to the proposed Child Labor Amendment, it held that the question of timeliness of ratification is a political and non-justiciable one, leaving the issue to Congress's discretion. It would appear that the length of time elapsing between proposal and ratification is irrelevant to the validity of the amendment. Based upon this precedent, the Archivist of the United States, on May 7, 1992, proclaimed the Twenty-seventh Amendment as having been ratified when it surpassed the \"three fourths of the several states\" plateau for becoming a part of the Constitution. It had been submitted to the states for ratification\u2014without a ratification deadline\u2014on September 25, 1789, an unprecedented time period of .\nExtensions.\nWhether once it has prescribed a ratification period Congress may extend the period without necessitating action by already-ratified States embroiled Congress, the states, and the courts in argument with respect to the proposed Equal Rights Amendment (Sent to the states on March 22, 1972, with a seven-year ratification time limit attached). In 1978 Congress, by simple majority vote in both houses, extended the original deadline by (through June 30, 1982).\nThe amendment's proponents argued that the fixing of a time limit and the extending of it were powers committed exclusively to Congress under the political question doctrine and that in any event Congress had power to extend. It was argued that inasmuch as the fixing of a reasonable time was within Congress' power and that Congress could fix the time either in advance or at some later point, based upon its evaluation of the social and other bases of the necessities of the amendment, Congress did not violate the Constitution when, once having fixed the time, it subsequently extended the time. Proponents recognized that if the time limit was fixed in the text of the amendment Congress could not alter it because the time limit as well as the substantive provisions of the proposal had been subject to ratification by a number of States, making it unalterable by Congress except through the amending process again. Opponents argued that Congress, having by a two-thirds vote sent the amendment and its authorizing resolution to the states, had put the matter beyond changing by passage of a simple resolution, that states had either acted upon the entire package or at least that they had or could have acted affirmatively upon the promise of Congress that if the amendment had not been ratified within the prescribed period it would expire and their assent would not be compelled for longer than they had intended.\nIn 1981, the United States District Court for the District of Idaho, however, found that Congress did not have the authority to extend the deadline, even when only contained within the proposing joint resolution's resolving clause. The Supreme Court had decided to take up the case, bypassing the Court of Appeals, but before they could hear the case, the extended period granted by Congress had been exhausted without the necessary number of states, thus rendering the case moot.\nConstitutional clauses shielded from amendment.\nArticle V also contains two statements that prohibit amending three clauses in Article I.\nDesigned to seal two compromises reached at the Constitutional Convention after contentious debates, these are the only entrenched provisions of the Constitution.\nThe guarantee of equal suffrage in the Senate is arguably subject to being amended through the procedures outlined within the article. Law professor George Mader holds that the shielding provision can be amended because it is not \"self-entrenched,\" meaning that it does not contain a provision preventing its own amendment. Thus, under Mader's argument, a two-step amendment process could repeal the provision that prevents the equal suffrage provision from being amended and then repeal the equal suffrage provision itself. Mader contrasts the provision preventing the modification of the equal suffrage clause with the unratified Corwin Amendment, which contains a self-entrenching, unamendable provision. Law professor Richard Albert agrees, contrasting the U.S. Constitution with other constitutions in which the provision that protects certain provisions from ever being amended also protects itself. Another legal scholar, Akhil Reed Amar, argues that such a two-step process is a \"sly scheme.\"\nExclusive means for amending the Constitution.\nAccording to constitutional theorist and scholar Lawrence G. Sager, there is debate among commentators about whether Article\u00a0V is the exclusive means of amending the Constitution, or whether there are routes to amendment, including some routes in which the Constitution could be unconsciously or unwittingly amended in a period of sustained political activity on the part of a mobilized national constituency. For example, Akhil Amar rejects the notion that Article V excludes other modes of constitutional change, arguing instead that the procedure provided for in Article V is simply the exclusive method the government may use to amend the Constitution. He asserts that Article V nowhere prevents the People themselves, acting apart from ordinary Government, from exercising their legal right to alter or abolish Government via the proper legal procedures.\nOther scholars disagree. Some argue that the Constitution itself provides no mechanism for the American people to adopt constitutional amendments independently of Article\u00a0V. Darren Patrick Guerra has argued that Article\u00a0V is a vital part of the American constitutional tradition and he defends it against modern critiques that Article V is either too difficult, too undemocratic, or too formal. Instead he argues that Article\u00a0V provides a clear and stable way of amending the document that is explicit, authentic, and the exclusive means of amendment; it promotes wisdom and justice through enhancing deliberation and prudence; and its process complements federalism and separation of powers that are key features of the Constitution. He argues that Article\u00a0V remains the most clear and powerful way to register the sovereign desires of the American public with regard to alterations of their fundamental law. In the end, Article\u00a0V is an essential bulwark to maintaining a written Constitution that secures the rights of the people against both elites and themselves.\nThe view that the Article\u00a0V amendment process is the only legitimate vehicle for bringing about constitutional change is, as pointed out by constitutional law scholar Joel K. Goldstein, \"challenged by numerous widely-accepted judicial decisions that have introduced new meaning into constitutional language by departing from original intentions, expectations, or meaning\". He also points out how constitutional institutions have, independent of both judicial activity and alterations effected though the Article\u00a0V process, evolved \"to take forms inconsistent with what the Founders imagined or the language they wrote suggested\".\nIn his farewell address, President George Washington said:\nIf in the opinion of the People the distribution or modification of the Constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution designates. But let there be no change by usurpation; for though this, in one instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the customary weapon by which free governments are destroyed. The precedent must always greatly overbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient benefit which the use can at any time yield.\nThis statement by Washington has become controversial, and scholars disagree about whether it still describes the proper constitutional order in the United States.
