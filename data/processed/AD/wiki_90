Developed during live performances before recording began, it was conceived as a concept album that would focus on the pressures faced by the band during their arduous lifestyle, and also deal with the mental health problems of the former band member Syd Barrett, who had departed the group in 1968. New material was recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in London.\nThe record builds on ideas explored in Pink Floyd's earlier recordings and performances, while omitting the extended instrumentals that characterised the band's earlier work. The group employed multitrack recording, tape loops, and analogue synthesisers, including experimentation with the EMS VCS 3 and a Synthi A. The engineer Alan Parsons was responsible for many aspects of the recording, and for the recruitment of the session singer Clare Torry, who appears on \"The Great Gig in the Sky\".\n\"The Dark Side of the Moon\" explores themes such as conflict, greed, time, death, and mental illness. Snippets from interviews with the band's road crew and others are featured alongside philosophical quotations. The sleeve, which depicts a prismatic spectrum, was designed by Storm Thorgerson in response to the keyboardist Richard Wright's request for a \"simple and bold\" design which would represent the band's lighting and the album's themes. The album was promoted with two singles: \"Money\" and \"Us and Them\".\n\"The Dark Side of the Moon\" received acclaim and is often featured in publication listings of the greatest albums of all time. It brought international fame and wealth to all four band members. A blockbuster release of the album era, it also propelled record sales throughout the music industry during the 1970s. \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" is certified 14\u00d7 platinum in the United Kingdom, and topped the US \"Billboard\" Top LPs &amp; Tape chart, where it has charted for 991 weeks. By 2013, \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" had sold over 45 million copies worldwide, making it the band's best-selling release, the best-selling album of the 1970s, and the fourth-best-selling album in history. In 2012, the album was selected for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". It was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999.\nBackground.\nFollowing \"Meddle\" in 1971, Pink Floyd assembled for a tour of Britain, Japan and the United States that December. In a band meeting at the home of the drummer, Nick Mason, in North London, the bassist, Roger Waters, proposed that a new album could form part of the tour. Waters conceived an album that dealt with things that \"make people mad\", focusing on the pressures associated with the band's arduous lifestyle, and dealing with the mental health problems suffered by the former band member Syd Barrett. The band had explored a similar idea with the 1969 concert suite \"The Man\" \"and\" \"The Journey\". In an interview for \"Rolling Stone\", the guitarist, David Gilmour, said: \"I think we all thought\u00a0\u2013 and Roger definitely thought\u00a0\u2013 that a lot of the lyrics that we had been using were a little too indirect. There was definitely a feeling that the words were going to be very clear and specific.\"\nThe band approved of Waters' concept for an album unified by a single theme, and all the members participated in writing and producing material. Waters created demo tracks in a small studio in a garden shed at his home in Islington. Parts of the album were taken from previously unused material; the opening line of \"Breathe\" came from an earlier work by Waters and Ron Geesin, written for the soundtrack of \"The Body\", and the basic structure of \"Us and Them\" was borrowed from an original composition, \"The Violent Sequence\", by the keyboardist, Richard Wright, for \"Zabriskie Point\". The band rehearsed at a warehouse in London owned by the Rolling Stones and at the Rainbow Theatre in Finsbury Park, London. They also purchased extra equipment, which included new speakers, a PA system, a 28-track mixing desk with a four channel quadraphonic output, and a custom-built lighting rig. Nine tonnes of kit was transported in three lorries. This would be the first time the band had taken an entire album on tour. The album had been given the provisional title of \"Dark Side of the Moon\" (an allusion to lunacy, rather than astronomy). After discovering that title had already been used by another band, Medicine Head, it was temporarily changed to \"Eclipse\". The new material was premiered at The Dome in Brighton, on 20 January 1972, and after the commercial failure of Medicine Head's album the title was changed back to the band's original preference.\n\"Dark Side of the Moon: A Piece for Assorted Lunatics\", as it was then known, was performed for an assembled press on 17 February 1972 at the Rainbow Theatre, more than a year before its release, and was critically acclaimed. Michael Wale of \"The Times\" described the piece as \"bringing tears to the eyes. It was so completely understanding and musically questioning.\" Derek Jewell of \"The Sunday Times\" wrote \"The ambition of the Floyd's artistic intention is now vast.\" \"Melody Maker\" was less enthusiastic: \"Musically, there were some great ideas, but the sound effects often left me wondering if I was in a bird-cage at London Zoo.\" The following tour was praised by the public. The new material was performed in the same order in which it was eventually sequenced on the album. Differences included the lack of synthesisers in tracks such as \"On the Run\", and Clare Torry's vocals on \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" replaced by readings from the Bible.\nPink Floyd's lengthy tour through Europe and North America gave them the opportunity to make improvements to the scale and quality of their performances. Work on the album was interrupted in late February when the band travelled to France and recorded music for the French director Barbet Schroeder's film \"La Vall\u00e9e\". They performed in Japan, returned to France in March to complete work on the film, played more shows in North America, then flew to London and resumed recording in May and June. After more concerts in Europe and North America, the band returned to London on 9 January 1973 to complete the album.\nConcept.\n\"The Dark Side of the Moon\" was built upon experiments Pink Floyd had attempted in their previous live shows and recordings, although it lacked the extended instrumental excursions which, according to the critic David Fricke, had become characteristic of the band following the departure of the founding member Syd Barrett in 1968. Gilmour, Barrett's replacement, later referred to those instrumentals as \"that psychedelic noodling stuff\". He and Waters cited 1971's \"Meddle\" as a turning point towards what would later be realised on the album. \"The Dark Side of the Moon\"'s lyrical themes include conflict, greed, the passage of time, death and insanity, the last inspired in part by Barrett's deteriorating mental state. The album contains musique concr\u00e8te on several tracks.\nEach side of the vinyl album is a continuous piece of music. The five tracks on each side reflect various stages of human life, beginning and ending with a heartbeat, exploring the nature of the human experience and, according to Waters, \"empathy\". \"Speak to Me\" and \"Breathe\" together highlight the mundane and futile elements of life that accompany the ever-present threat of madness, and the importance of living one's own life\u00a0\u2013 \"Don't be afraid to care\". By shifting the scene to an airport, the synthesiser-driven instrumental \"On the Run\" evokes the stress and anxiety of modern travel, in particular Wright's fear of flying. \"Time\" examines the manner in which its passage can control one's life and offers a stark warning to those who remain focused on mundane pursuits; it is concluded with a retreat into solitude and withdrawal in the reprise of \"Breathe\". The first side of the album ends with Wright and Clare Torry's soulful metaphor for death, \"The Great Gig in the Sky\".\n\"Money\", the first track on side two, opens with the sound of cash registers and rhythmically jingling coins. The song mocks greed and consumerism with sarcastic lyrics and cash-related sound effects. \"Money\" became the band's most commercially successful track and was covered by other artists. \"Us and Them\" addresses the isolation of the depressed with the symbolism of conflict and the use of simple dichotomies to describe personal relationships. \"Any Colour You Like\" tackles the illusion of choice one has in society. \"Brain Damage\" looks at mental illness resulting from the elevation of fame and success above the needs of the self; in particular, the line \"and if the band you're in starts playing different tunes\" reflects the mental breakdown of Syd Barrett. The album ends with \"Eclipse\", which espouses the concepts of otherness and unity while encouraging the listener to recognise the common traits shared by humanity.\nRecording.\n\"The Dark Side of the Moon\" was recorded at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in approximately 60 days between 31 May 1972 and 9 February 1973. Pink Floyd were assigned the staff engineer Alan Parsons, who had worked as the assistant tape operator on their fifth album, \"Atom Heart Mother\" (1970), and had gained experience as a recording engineer on the Beatles albums \"Abbey Road\" and \"Let It Be\". The \"Dark Side of the Moon\" sessions made use of advanced studio techniques, especially the Studer A80 16-track recorders, an appreciable advantage over the eight- or four-track recordings they'd previously made, although the band often used so many tracks that second-generation copies were still needed to make more space available on the tape. The mix supervisor Chris Thomas recalled later, \"There were only two or three tracks of drums when we came to mixing it. Depending on the song, there would be one or two tracks of guitar, and these would include the solo and the rhythm guitar parts. One track for keyboard, one track for bass, and one or two sound effects tracks. They had been very, very efficient in the way they'd worked.\"\nThe first track recorded was \"Us and Them\" on 31 May, followed seven days later by \"Money\". For \"Money\", Waters had created effects loops in an unusual time signature from recordings of money-related objects, including coins thrown into a mixing bowl in his wife's pottery studio. These were re-recorded to take advantage of the band's decision to create a quadraphonic mix of the album, although Parsons later expressed dissatisfaction with the result of this mix, which he attributed to a lack of time and a shortage of multitrack tape recorders.\n\"Time\" and \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" were recorded next, followed by a two-month break, during which the band spent time with their families and prepared for a tour of the United States. The recording sessions were frequently interrupted: Waters, a supporter of Arsenal F.C., would break to see his team compete, and the band would occasionally stop to watch \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" on television while Parsons worked on the tracks. Gilmour recalled, \"...but when we were on a roll, we would get on.\"\nAfter returning from the US in January 1973, they recorded \"Brain Damage\", \"Eclipse\", \"Any Colour You Like\" and \"On the Run\", and fine-tuned work from previous sessions. Four female vocalists were assembled to sing on \"Brain Damage\", \"Eclipse\" and \"Time\", and the saxophonist Dick Parry was booked to play on \"Us and Them\" and \"Money\". With the director Adrian Maben, the band also filmed studio footage for \"\". The album was completed and signed off at Abbey Road on 9 February 1973. Gilmour recalled the band listening to the finished album for the first time as \"a moment of great joy and of satisfaction and the feeling of achievement that we'd really gone that extra mile\".\nInstrumentation.\nThe album features metronomic sound effects during \"Speak to Me\" and tape loops for the opening of \"Money\". Mason created a rough version of \"Speak to Me\" at his home before completing it in the studio. The track serves as an overture and contains cross-fades of elements from other pieces on the album. A piano chord, replayed backwards, serves to augment the build-up of effects, which are immediately followed by the opening of \"Breathe\". Mason received a rare solo composing credit for \"Speak to Me\".\nThe sound effects on \"Money\" were created by splicing together Waters' recordings of clinking coins, tearing paper, a ringing cash register, and a clicking adding machine, which were used to create a 7-beat effects loop. This was later adapted to four tracks to create a \"walk around the room\" effect in quadraphonic presentations of the album. At times, the degree of sonic experimentation on the album required the studio engineers and all four band members to operate the mixing console's faders simultaneously, in order to mix down the intricately assembled multitrack recordings of several of the songs, particularly \"On the Run\".\nAlong with conventional rock band instrumentation, Pink Floyd introduced prominent synthesisers to their sound. The band experimented with an EMS VCS 3 on \"Brain Damage\" and \"Any Colour You Like\", and a Synthi A on \"Time\" and \"On the Run\". They also devised and recorded unconventional sounds, such as assistant engineer Peter James running around the studio's echo chamber during \"On the Run\", and a specially treated bass drum made to simulate a human heartbeat during \"Speak to Me\", \"On the Run\", \"Time\" and \"Eclipse\". This heartbeat is most prominent in the intro and the outro to the album, but it can also be heard sporadically on \"Time\" and \"On the Run\". \"Time\" features assorted clocks ticking, then chiming simultaneously at the start of the song, accompanied by a series of Rototoms. The recordings were initially created as a quadraphonic test by Parsons, who recorded each timepiece at an antique clock shop. Although these recordings had not been created specifically for the album, elements of this material were eventually used in the track.\nVoices.\nSeveral tracks, including \"Us and Them\" and \"Time\", demonstrated Wright's and Gilmour's ability to harmonise their similar-sounding voices, and the engineer Alan Parsons used techniques such as double tracking vocals and guitars, which allowed Gilmour to harmonise with himself. Prominent use was also made of flanging and phase-shifting on vocals and instruments, odd trickery with reverb, and the panning of sounds between channels, most notably in the quadraphonic mix of \"On the Run\", where the sound of the Hammond B3 organ played through a Leslie speaker swirls around the listener.\nWright's \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" features Clare Torry, a session singer and songwriter and a regular at Abbey Road. Parsons liked her voice, and when the band decided to use a female vocalist he suggested that she could sing on the track. The band explained the album concept to her, but they were unable to tell her exactly what she should do, and Gilmour, who was in charge of the session, asked her to try to express emotions rather than sing words. In a few takes on a Sunday night, Torry improvised a wordless melody to accompany Wright's emotive piano solo. She was initially embarrassed by her exuberance in the recording booth and wanted to apologise to the band, who were impressed with her performance but did not tell her so. Her takes were edited to produce the version used on the track. She left the studio under the impression that her vocals would not make the final cut, and she only became aware that she had been included in the final mix when she picked up the album at a local record store and saw her name in the credits. For her contribution she was paid her standard session fee of \u00a330, equivalent to about \u00a3 in 2023.\nIn 2004, Torry sued EMI and Pink Floyd for 50% of the songwriting royalties, arguing that her contribution to \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" was substantial enough to be considered co-authorship. The case was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum, with all post-2005 pressings crediting Wright and Torry jointly.\nIn the final week of recording, Waters asked staff and others at Abbey Road to respond to questions printed on flashcards and some of their replies were edited into the final mix. The interviewees were placed in front of a microphone in a darkened Studio 3 and shown such questions as \"What's your favourite colour?\" and \"What's your favourite food?\", before moving on to themes central to the album, including those of madness, violence, and death. Questions such as \"When was the last time you were violent?\", followed immediately by \"Were you in the right?\", were answered in the order they were presented.\nRoadie Roger \"The Hat\" Manifold was recorded in a conventional sit-down interview. Waters asked him about a violent encounter he had had with a motorist, and Manifold replied \"...\u00a0give 'em a quick, short, sharp shock\u00a0...\" Asked about death, he responded, \"Live for today, gone tomorrow, that's me\u00a0...\" Another roadie, Chris Adamson, recorded the words that open the album: \"I've been mad for fucking years. Absolutely years. Over the edge... It's working with bands that does it.\"\nThe band's road manager Peter Watts (father of the actress Naomi Watts) contributed the repeated laughter during \"Brain Damage\" and \"Speak to Me\", as well as the line \"I can't think of anything to say\". His second wife, Patricia \"Puddie\" Watts (now Patricia Gleason), was responsible for the line about the \"geezer\" who was \"cruisin' for a bruisin'\", used in the segue between \"Money\" and \"Us and Them\", and the words \"I never said I was frightened of dying\" halfway through \"The Great Gig in the Sky\".\nSeveral of the responses \u2013 \"I am not frightened of dying. Any time will do, I don't mind. Why should I be frightened of dying? There's no reason for it\u00a0 ... you've got to go sometime\"; \"I know I've been mad, I've always been mad, like most of us have\"; and the closing \"There is no dark side in the moon really. Matter of fact, it's all dark\" \u2013 came from the studios' Irish doorman, Gerry O'Driscoll. \"The bit you don't hear,\" said Parsons, \"is that, after that, he said, 'The only thing that makes it look alight is the sun.' The band were too overjoyed with his first line, and it would have been an anticlimax to continue.\"\nPaul and Linda McCartney were interviewed, but their answers \u2013 judged to be \"trying too hard to be funny\" \u2013 were not used. The McCartneys' Wings bandmate Henry McCullough contributed the line, \"I don't know, I was really drunk at the time.\"\nCompletion.\nWhen the flashcard sessions were finished, producer Chris Thomas was hired to provide \"a fresh pair of ears\" for the final mix. Thomas's background was in music rather than engineering; he had worked with Beatles producer George Martin and was an acquaintance of Pink Floyd's manager, Steve O'Rourke. The members of the band were said to have disagreed over the mix, with Waters and Mason preferring a \"dry\" and \"clean\" mix that made more use of the non-musical elements and Gilmour and Wright preferring a subtler and more \"echoey\" mix. Thomas said later, \"There was no difference in opinion between them, I don't remember Roger once saying that he wanted less echo. In fact, there were never any hints that they were later going to fall out. It was a very creative atmosphere. A lot of fun.\"\nThomas's intervention resulted in a compromise between Waters and Gilmour, who were both satisfied with the result. Thomas was responsible for significant changes, including the perfect timing of the echo used on \"Us and Them\". He was also present for the recording of \"The Great Gig in the Sky\". Waters said in an interview in 2006, when asked if he felt his goals had been accomplished in the studio:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When the record was finished I took a reel-to-reel copy home with me and I remember playing it for my wife then, and I remember her bursting into tears when it was finished. And I thought, \"This has obviously struck a chord somewhere\", and I was kinda pleased by that. You know when you've done something, certainly if you create a piece of music, you then hear it with fresh ears when you play it for somebody else. And at that point I thought to myself, \"Wow, this is a pretty complete piece of work\", and I had every confidence that people would respond to it.\nPackaging.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIt felt like the whole band were working together. It was a creative time. We were all very open.\n\u2013 Richard Wright\nThe album was originally released in a gatefold LP sleeve designed by Hipgnosis and George Hardie. Hipgnosis had designed several of the band's previous albums, with controversial results; EMI had reacted with confusion when faced with the cover designs for \"Atom Heart Mother\" and \"Obscured by Clouds\", as they had expected to see traditional designs which included lettering and words. Designers Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell were able to ignore such criticism, as they were employed by the band. For \"The Dark Side of the Moon\", Wright suggested something \"smarter, neater\u00a0\u2013 more classy\", and simple, \"like the artwork of a Black Magic chocolate box\".\nThe design was inspired by a photograph of a prism with a beam of white light projected through it and emerging in the colours of the visible spectrum that Thorgerson had found in a 1963 physics textbook, as well as by an illustration by Alex Steinweiss, the inventor of album cover art, for the New York Philharmonic's 1942 performance of Ludwig van Beethoven's Emperor Concerto. The artwork was created by an associate of Hipgnosis, George Hardie. Hipgnosis offered a choice of seven designs for the sleeve, but all four members of the band agreed that the prism was the best. \"There were no arguments,\" said Roger Waters. \"We all pointed to the prism and said 'That's the one'.\"\nThe design depicts a glass prism dispersing white light into colours and represents three elements: the band's stage lighting, the album lyrics, and Wright's request for a \"simple and bold\" design. At Waters' suggestion, the spectrum of light continues through to the gatefold. Added shortly afterwards, the gatefold design also includes a visual representation of the heartbeat sound used throughout the album, and the back of the album cover contains Thorgerson's suggestion of another prism recombining the spectrum of light, to make possible interesting layouts of the sleeve in record shops. The light band emanating from the prism on the album cover has six colours, missing indigo, compared with the usual division of the visible spectrum into red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Inside the sleeve were two posters and two pyramid-themed stickers. One poster bore pictures of the band in concert, overlaid with scattered letters to form PINK FLOYD, and the other an infrared photograph of the Great Pyramids of Giza, created by Powell and Thorgerson.\nThe band were so confident of the quality of Waters' lyrics that, for the first time, they printed them on the album's sleeve.\nRelease.\nAs the quadraphonic mix of the album was not then complete, the band (with the exception of Wright) boycotted the press reception held at the London Planetarium on 27 February. The guests were, instead, presented with a quartet of life-sized cardboard cut-outs of the band, and the stereo mix of the album was played over a poor-quality public address system. Generally, however, the press were enthusiastic; \"Melody Maker\"'s Roy Hollingworth described Side One as \"so utterly confused with itself it was difficult to follow\", but praised Side Two, writing: \"The songs, the sounds, the rhythms were solid and sound, Saxophone hit the air, the band rocked and rolled, and then gushed and tripped away into the night.\" Steve Peacock of \"Sounds\" wrote: \"I don't care if you've never heard a note of the Pink Floyd's music in your life, I'd unreservedly recommend everyone to \"The Dark Side of the Moon\"\". In his 1973 review for \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, Loyd Grossman declared \"Dark Side\" \"a fine album with a textural and conceptual richness that not only invites, but demands involvement\". In \"\" (1981), Robert Christgau found its lyrical ideas clich\u00e9d and its music pretentious, but called it a \"kitsch masterpiece\" that can be charming with highlights such as taped speech fragments, Parry's saxophone, and studio effects which enhance Gilmour's guitar solos.\n\"The Dark Side of the Moon\" was released first in the US on 1 March 1973, and then in the UK on 16 March. It became an instant chart success in Britain and throughout Western Europe; by the following month, it had gained a gold certification in the US. Throughout March 1973 the band played the album as part of their US tour, including a midnight performance at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on 17 March before an audience of 6,000. The album reached the \"Billboard\" Top LPs &amp; Tape chart's number one spot on 28 April 1973, and was so successful that the band returned two months later for another tour. In Canada, it was in the top three for 22 weeks between May 5 and September 29, 1973.\nLabel.\nMuch of the album's early American success is attributed to the efforts of Pink Floyd's US record company, Capitol Records. Newly appointed chairman Bhaskar Menon set about trying to reverse the relatively poor sales of the band's 1971 studio album \"Meddle\". Meanwhile, disenchanted with Capitol, the band and manager O'Rourke had been quietly negotiating a new contract with CBS president Clive Davis, on Columbia Records. \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" was the last album that Pink Floyd were obliged to release before formally signing a new contract. Menon's enthusiasm for the new album was such that he began a huge promotional advertising campaign, which included radio-friendly truncated versions of \"Us and Them\" and \"Time\".\nIn some countries\u00a0\u2013 notably the UK\u00a0\u2013 Pink Floyd had not released a single since 1968's \"Point Me at the Sky\", and unusually \"Money\" was released as a single on 7 May, with \"Any Colour You Like\" on the B-side. It reached number\u00a013 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in July 1973. A two-sided white label promotional version of the single, with mono and stereo mixes, was sent to radio stations. The mono side had the word \"bullshit\" removed from the song\u00a0\u2013 leaving \"bull\" in its place\u00a0\u2013 however, the stereo side retained the uncensored version. This was subsequently withdrawn; the replacement was sent to radio stations with a note advising disc jockeys to dispose of the first uncensored copy. On 4 February 1974, a double A-side single was released with \"Time\" on one side, and \"Us and Them\" on the opposite side. Menon's efforts to secure a contract renewal with Pink Floyd were in vain however; at the beginning of 1974, the band signed for Columbia with a reported advance fee of $1M (in Britain and Europe they continued to be represented by Harvest Records).\nSales.\n\"The Dark Side of the Moon\" became one of the best-selling albums of all time and is in the top\u00a025 of a list of best-selling albums in the United States. Although it held the number one spot in the US for only a week, it remained in the \"Billboard\" 200 albums chart for 736\u00a0nonconsecutive weeks (from 17 March 1973 to 16 July 1988). Of those first 736 charted weeks, the album had two notable consecutive runs in the \"Billboard\" 200 chart: 84 weeks (from 17 March 1973 to 19 October 1974) and 593 weeks (from 18 December 1976 to 23 April 1988). It made its final appearance in the \"Billboard\" 200 albums chart during its initial run on the week ending 8 October 1988, in its 741st charted week. It re-appeared on the \"Billboard\" charts with the introduction of the Top Pop Catalog Albums chart in the issue dated 25 May 1991, and was still a perennial feature ten years later. It reached number one on the Pop Catalog chart when the 2003 hybrid CD/SACD edition was released and sold 800,000\u00a0copies in the US. On the week of 5 May 2006 \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" achieved a combined total of 1,716\u00a0weeks on the \"Billboard\"\u00a0200 and Pop Catalog charts.\nAfter a change in chart methodology in 2009, which allowed catalogue titles to be included in the \"Billboard\" 200, \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" returned to the chart at number 189 on 12 December of that year for its 742nd charting week. It has continued to sporadically appear on the \"Billboard 200\" since then, with the total at 991 weeks on the chart as of October 2025. \"On a slow week\" between 8,000 and 9,000\u00a0copies are sold. As of April 2013, the album had sold 9,502,000 copies in the US since 1991 when Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales for \"Billboard\". In 2007, one in every fourteen people in the US under the age of\u00a050 was estimated to have owned a copy.\n\"The Dark Side of the Moon\" was released before the introduction of platinum certification in 1976 by Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and therefore held only a gold certification until 16 February 1990, when it was certified 11 times platinum. On 4 June 1998, the RIAA certified the album 15\u00d7 platinum, denoting sales of fifteen million in the United States. This makes it Pink Floyd's biggest-selling work there; \"The Wall\" is 23 times platinum, but as a double album this signifies sales of 11.5\u00a0million. \"Money\" has sold well as a single, and as with \"Time\", remains a radio favourite; in the US, for the year ending 20 April 2005, \"Time\" was played on 13,723\u00a0occasions, and \"Money\" on 13,731\u00a0occasions. In 2017, \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" was the seventh-bestselling album of all time in the UK and the highest-selling album never to reach number one. As one of the blockbuster LPs of the album era (1960s\u20132000s), \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" also led to an increase in record sales overall into the late 1970s. In 2013, industry sources suggested that worldwide sales of \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" totalled about 45\u00a0million.In 1993, Gilmour attributed the album's success to the combination of music, lyrics and cover art: \"All the music before had not had any great lyrical point to it. And this one was clear and concise.\" Mason said that, when they finished the album, Pink Floyd felt confident it was their best work to date, but were surprised by its commercial success. He said it was \"not only about being a good album but also about being in the right place at the right time\".\nReissues and remasters.\nIn 1979, \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" was released as a remastered LP by Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab, and in April 1988 on their \"Ultradisc\" gold CD format. It was released by EMI and Harvest on CD in Japan in June 1983 and in the US and Europe in August 1984. In 1992, it was rereleased as a remastered CD in the box set \"Shine On\". This version was re-released as a 20th-anniversary box set edition with postcards the following year, with a cover design by Thorgerson. On some pressings, an orchestral version of the Beatles' \"Ticket to Ride\" is faintly audible after \"Eclipse\" over the closing heartbeats.\n30th-anniversary 5.1 surround sound mix.\nA quadraphonic mix, created by Alan Parsons, was commissioned by EMI but never endorsed by Pink Floyd, as Parsons was disappointed with his mix. For the album's 30th anniversary, an updated surround version was released in 2003. The band elected not to use Parsons' quadraphonic mix, and instead had the engineer James Guthrie create a new 5.1\u00a0channel surround sound mix on the SACD format. Guthrie had worked with Pink Floyd since their eleventh album, \"The Wall\", and had previously worked on surround versions of \"The Wall\" for DVD-Video and Waters' \"In the Flesh\" for SACD. In 2003, Parsons expressed disappointment with Guthrie's SACD mix, suggesting he was \"possibly a little too true to the original mix\", but was generally complimentary. The 30th-anniversary edition won four Surround Music Awards in 2003, and sold more than 800,000\u00a0copies.\nThe cover image of the 30th-anniversary edition was created by a team of designers including Thorgerson. The image is a photograph of a custom-made stained glass window, built to match the dimensions and proportions of the original prism design. Transparent glass, held in place by strips of lead, was used in place of the opaque colours of the original. The idea is derived from the \"sense of purity in the sound quality, being 5.1 surround sound\u00a0...\" The image was created out of a desire to be \"the same but different, such that the design was clearly DSotM, still the recognisable prism design, but was different and hence new\".\nLater reissues.\n\"The Dark Side of the Moon\" was rereleased in 2003 on 180-gram virgin vinyl and mastered by Kevin Gray at AcousTech Mastering. It included slightly different versions of the posters and stickers that came with the original vinyl release, along with a new 30th-anniversary poster. In 2007, the album was included in \"Oh, by the Way\", a box set celebrating the 40th anniversary of Pink Floyd, and a DRM-free version was released on the iTunes Store. In 2011, it was reissued featuring a remastered version with various other material.\nIn 2023, Pink Floyd released the \"Dark Side of the Moon 50th Anniversary\" box set, including a newly remastered edition of the album, surround sound mixes (including the 5.1 mix and a new Dolby Atmos mix), a photo book, and \"The Dark Side of the Moon Live at Wembley 1974\", on vinyl. In 2024, the 50th Anniversary LP edition was rereleased in two clear vinyl LPs; only one side of each LP is playable to allow the UV artwork to be printed on the non-groove side.\nLegacy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIt's changed me in many ways, because it's brought in a lot of money, and one feels very secure when you can sell an album for two years. But it hasn't changed my attitude to music. Even though it was so successful, it was made in the same way as all our other albums, and the only criterion we have about releasing music is whether we like it or not. It was not a deliberate attempt to make a commercial album. It just happened that way. We knew it had a lot more melody than previous Floyd albums, and there was a concept that ran all through it. The music was easier to absorb and having girls singing away added a commercial touch that none of our records had.\n\u2013 Richard Wright\nThe success of the album brought wealth to all four members of the band; Richard Wright and Roger Waters bought large country houses, and Nick Mason became a collector of upmarket cars. The group were fans of the British comedy troupe Monty Python, and as such, some of the profits were invested in the production of \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\". Parsons received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Engineered Recording, Non-Classical for \"The Dark Side of the Moon\", and he went on to have a successful career as a recording artist with the Alan Parsons Project. Although Waters and Gilmour have on occasion downplayed his contribution to the success, Mason praised his role. In 2003, Parsons reflected: \"I think they all felt that I managed to hang the rest of my career on \"Dark Side of the Moon\", which has an element of truth to it. But I still wake up occasionally, frustrated about the fact that they made untold millions and a lot of the people involved in the record didn't.\"\nPart of the legacy of \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" is its influence on modern music and on the musicians who have performed cover versions of its songs. It is often seen as a pivotal point in the history of rock music, and comparisons are sometimes made with Radiohead's 1997 album \"OK Computer\", including a premise explored by Ben Schleifer in \"'Speak to Me': The Legacy of Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon\" (2006) that the two albums share a theme that \"the creative individual loses the ability to function in the [modern] world\".\nIn a 2018 book about classic rock, Steven Hyden recalls concluding, in his teens, that \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" and \"Led Zeppelin IV\" were the two greatest albums of the genre, vision quests \"encompass[ing] the twin poles of teenage desire\". They had similarities, in that both albums' cover and internal artwork eschew pictures of the bands in favour of \"inscrutable iconography without any tangible meaning (which always seemed to give the music packaged inside \"more\" meaning)\". But whereas Led Zeppelin had looked outward, toward \"conquering the world\" and were known at the time for their outrageous sexual antics on tour, Pink Floyd looked inward, toward \"overcoming your own hang-ups\". In 2013, \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nRankings.\n\"The Dark Side of the Moon\" frequently appears on professional rankings of the greatest albums. In 1987, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked it the 35th best album of the preceding 20 years. \"Rolling Stone\" ranked it number 43 on its 2003 and 2012 lists of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" and number 55 in its 2020 list, Pink Floyd's highest placement. Both \"Rolling Stone\" and \"Q\" have listed \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" as the best progressive rock album.\nIn 2006, Australian Broadcasting Corporation viewers voted \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" their favourite album. \"NME\" readers voted it the eighth-best album in a 2006 poll, and in 2009, Planet Rock listeners voted it the greatest of all time. The album is also number two on the \"Definitive 200\" list of albums, made by the National Association of Recording Merchandisers \"in celebration of the art form of the record album\". It ranked 29th in \"The Observer\"'s 2006 list of \"The 50 Albums That Changed Music\", and 37th in \"The Guardian\"'s 1997 list of the \"100 Best Albums Ever\", as voted for by a panel of artists and music critics. In 2014, readers of \"Rhythm\" voted it the seventh most influential progressive drumming album. It was voted number 9 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition (2000). In 2007, VH1 named \"Dark Side of the Moon\" the fourth-greatest album cover.\nCovers, tributes and samples.\n\"Return to the Dark Side of the Moon: A Tribute to Pink Floyd\", released in 2006, is a cover album of \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" featuring artists such as Adrian Belew, Tommy Shaw, Dweezil Zappa, and Rick Wakeman. In 2000, The Squirrels released \"The Not So Bright Side of the Moon\", which features a cover of the entire album. The New York dub collective Easy Star All-Stars released \"Dub Side of the Moon\" in 2003 and \"Dubber Side of the Moon\" in 2010. The group Voices on the Dark Side released the album \"Dark Side of the Moon a Cappella\", a complete a cappella version of the album. The bluegrass band Poor Man's Whiskey frequently play the album in bluegrass style, calling the suite \"Dark Side of the Moonshine\". A string quartet version of the album was released in 2003. In 2009, the Flaming Lips released a track-by-track remake of the album in collaboration with Stardeath and White Dwarfs, and featuring Henry Rollins and Peaches as guest musicians.\nSeveral notable acts have covered the album live in its entirety, and a range of performers have used samples from \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" in their own material. Jam-rock band Phish performed a semi-improvised version of the entire album as part of their show on 2 November 1998 in West Valley City, Utah. Progressive metal band Dream Theater have twice covered the album in their live shows, and in May 2011 Mary Fahl released \"From the Dark Side of the Moon\", a song-by-song \"re-imagining\" of the album. Milli Vanilli used the tape loops from Pink Floyd's \"Money\" to open their track \"Money\", followed by Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch on \"Music for the People\".\n\"The Wizard of Oz\".\nIn the 1990s, it was discovered that playing \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" alongside the 1939 film \"The Wizard of Oz\" produced moments of apparent synchronicity, and it was suggested that this was intentional. Such moments include Dorothy beginning to jog at the lyric \"no one told you when to run\" during \"Time\", balancing on a fence, tightrope-style, during the line \"balanced on the biggest wave\" in \"Breathe\", and putting her ear to the Tin Man's chest as the album's closing heartbeats are heard. Parsons and members of Pink Floyd denied any connection, with Parsons calling it \"a complete load of eyewash ... If you play any record with the sound turned down on the TV, you will find things that work.\"\n\"The Dark Side of the Moon Redux\".\nFor the 50th anniversary of \"The Dark Side of the Moon\", Waters recorded a new version, \"The Dark Side of the Moon Redux\", released in October 2023. It was recorded with no other members of Pink Floyd, and features spoken word sections and more downbeat arrangements, with no guitar solos. Waters said he wanted to \"bring out the heart and soul of the album musically and spiritually\". He also said it is intended to be taken from the perspective of an older man, as \"not enough people recognised what it's about, what it was I was saying then\".\nTrack listing.\nAll lyrics are written by Roger Waters.\nNote\nPersonnel.\nPink Floyd\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCharts.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nInformational notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "42635", "revid": "44106950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42635", "title": "Charles Manson", "text": "American criminal and cult leader (1934\u20132017)\nCharles Milles Manson (n\u00e9\u00a0Maddox; November 12, 1934 \u2013 November 19, 2017) was an American criminal, cult leader, and musician who led the Manson Family, a cult based in California in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Some cult members committed a series of at least nine murders at four locations in July and August 1969. In 1971, Manson was convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of seven people, including the film actress Sharon Tate. The prosecution contended that, while Manson never directly ordered the murders, his ideology constituted an overt act of conspiracy.\nBefore the murders, Manson had spent more than half of his life in correctional institutions. While gathering his cult following, he was a singer-songwriter on the fringe of the Los Angeles music industry, chiefly through a chance association with Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys, who introduced Manson to record producer Terry Melcher. In 1968, the Beach Boys recorded Manson's song \"Cease to Exist\", renamed \"Never Learn Not to Love\" as a single B-side, but Manson was uncredited. Afterward, he attempted to secure a record contract through Melcher, but was unsuccessful. \nManson would often talk about the Beatles, including their eponymous 1968 album. According to Los Angeles County District Attorney Vincent Bugliosi, Manson felt guided by his interpretation of the Beatles' lyrics and adopted the term \"Helter Skelter\" to describe an impending apocalyptic race war. During his trial, Bugliosi argued that Manson had intended to start a race war, although Manson and others disputed this. Contemporary interviews and trial witness testimony insisted that the Tate\u2013LaBianca murders were copycat crimes intended to exonerate Manson's friend Bobby Beausoleil. Manson denied having ordered any murders. He served his time in prison and died from complications from colon cancer in 2017.\n1934\u20131967: Early life.\nChildhood.\nCharles Milles Maddox was born on November 12, 1934, to 16-year-old Ada Kathleen Maddox of Ashland, Kentucky, in Cincinnati General Hospital, now the University of Cincinnati Academic Health Center, in Cincinnati, Ohio. Manson's Ohio birth certificate simply lists his name as \"Manson.\" His biological father appears to have been Colonel Walker Henderson Scott Sr. of Catlettsburg, Kentucky, against whom Maddox filed a paternity suit that resulted in an agreed judgment in 1937. Scott worked intermittently in local mills, and had a local reputation as a con artist. He allowed Maddox to believe that he was an army colonel, although \"Colonel\" was merely his given name. When Maddox told Scott that she was pregnant, he informed her that he had been called away on army business. After several months, she realized he had no intention of returning. Manson never knew his biological father.\nIn August 1934, before Manson's birth, Maddox married William Eugene Manson (1909\u20131961), a laborer at a dry cleaning business. Maddox often went on drinking sprees with her brother Luther Elbert Maddox (1916\u20131950), leaving Charles with babysitters. On April 30, 1937, Maddox and her husband divorced, after William alleged \"gross neglect of duty\" by Maddox. Charles retained William's last name of Manson. On August 1, 1939, Kathleen and Luther were arrested for assault and robbery, and sentenced to five and ten years of imprisonment, respectively.\nManson was placed in the home of an aunt and uncle in McMechen, West Virginia. His mother was paroled in 1942. Manson later characterized the first weeks after she returned from prison as the happiest time in his life. Weeks after her release, Manson's family moved to Charleston, West Virginia, where he continually played truant and his mother spent her evenings drinking. She was arrested for grand larceny, but not convicted. The family later moved to Indianapolis, where Maddox met alcoholic Lewis Woodson Cavender Jr. (1916\u20131979) through Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and married him in August 1943.\nFirst offenses.\nIn an interview with Diane Sawyer, Manson stated that when he was aged 9, he set his school on fire. He also got repeatedly in trouble for truancy and petty theft. In 1947, although there was a lack of foster home placements, at age 13, Manson was placed in the Gibault School for Boys in Terre Haute, Indiana, a school for male delinquents run by Catholic priests. Gibault was a strict school, where punishment for even the smallest infraction included beatings with either a wooden paddle or a leather strap. Manson ran away from Gibault and slept in the woods, under bridges and wherever else he could find shelter.\nManson fled home to his mother and spent Christmas 1947 at his aunt and uncle's house in West Virginia. His mother returned him to Gibault. Ten months later, he ran away to Indianapolis. It was there, in 1948, Manson committed his first documented crime by robbing a grocery store, at first to simply find something to eat. Manson found a cigar box containing just over a hundred dollars, which he used to rent a room on Indianapolis's Skid Row and to buy food.\nFor a time, Manson had a job delivering messages for Western Union in an attempt to live honestly. He quickly began to supplement his wages through theft. He was eventually caught, and in 1949 a sympathetic judge sent him to Boys Town, a juvenile facility in Omaha, Nebraska. After four days at Boys Town, he and fellow student Blackie Nielson obtained a gun and stole a car. They used it to commit two armed robberies on their way to the home of Nielson's uncle in Peoria, Illinois. Nielson's uncle was a professional thief, and when the boys arrived he allegedly took them on as apprentices. Manson was arrested two weeks later during a nighttime raid on a Peoria store. In the investigation that followed, he was linked to his two earlier armed robberies. He was sent to the Indiana Boys School, a strict reform school outside of Plainfield, Indiana.\nAt the Indiana Boys School, other students allegedly raped Manson with the encouragement of a staff member, and he was repeatedly beaten. He ran away from the school eighteen times. Manson developed a self-defense technique he later called the \"insane game\", in which he would screech, grimace and wave his arms to convince stronger aggressors that he was insane. In February 1951, after a number of failed attempts, he escaped with two other boys. The three escapees robbed filling stations while attempting to drive to California in stolen cars, until they were arrested in Utah. For the federal crime of driving a stolen car across state lines, Manson was sent to Washington, D.C.'s National Training School for Boys. On arrival he was given aptitude tests which determined that he was illiterate, but had an above-average IQ of 109. His case worker deemed him aggressively antisocial.\nFirst imprisonment.\nIn October 1951, on a psychiatrist's recommendation, Manson was transferred to Natural Bridge Honor Camp, a minimum security institution in Virginia. His aunt visited him and told administrators she would let him stay at her house and help him find work. Manson had a parole hearing scheduled for February 1952. In January, he was caught raping a boy at knifepoint. Manson was transferred to the Federal Reformatory in Petersburg, Virginia, where he committed a further \"eight serious disciplinary offenses, three involving homosexual acts\". He was then moved to a maximum security reformatory at Chillicothe, Ohio, where he was expected to remain until his release on his 21st birthday in November 1955. Good behavior led to an early release in May 1954, to live with his aunt and uncle in West Virginia.\nIn January 1955, Manson married a hospital waitress named Rosalie \"Rosie\" Jean Willis (January 28, 1939 \u2013 August 21, 2009). Around October, about three months after he and his pregnant wife arrived in Los Angeles in a car he had stolen in Ohio, Manson was again charged with a federal crime for taking the vehicle across state lines. After a psychiatric evaluation, he was given five years' probation. Manson's failure to appear at a Los Angeles hearing on an identical charge filed in Florida resulted in his March 1956 arrest in Indianapolis. His probation was revoked, and he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment at Terminal Island in Los Angeles.\nWhile Manson was in prison, Rosalie gave birth to their son, Charles Manson Jr. (April 10, 1956 \u2013 June 29, 1993). During his first year at Terminal Island, Manson received visits from Rosalie and his mother, who were now living together in Los Angeles. In March 1957, when the visits from his wife ceased, his mother informed him Rosalie was living with another man. Less than two weeks before a scheduled parole hearing, Manson tried to escape by stealing a car. He was given five years' probation and his parole was denied.\nSecond imprisonment.\nIn September 1958, Manson received five years' parole, the same year in which Rosalie received a decree of divorce. By November, he was pimping a 16-year-old girl and receiving additional support from a girl with wealthy parents. In September 1959, he pleaded guilty to a charge of attempting to cash a forged U.S. Treasury check, which he claimed to have stolen from a mailbox; the latter charge was later dropped. He received a ten-year suspended sentence and probation after a young woman named Leona Rae \"Candy\" Stevens, who had an arrest record for prostitution, made a \"tearful plea\" before the court that she and Manson were \"deeply in love\u00a0... and would marry if Charlie were freed\". Before the year's end, Stevens married Manson. Vincent Bugliosi, the prosecutor who later secured Manson's murder conviction, believed the marriage may have been so she could not be required to testify against Manson.\nManson took Leona and another woman to New Mexico for purposes of prostitution, resulting in him being held and questioned for violating the Mann Act. Though he was released, Manson correctly suspected that the investigation had not ended. When he disappeared in violation of his probation, a bench warrant was issued. In April 1960, an indictment for violation of the Mann Act followed. Following the arrest of one of the women for prostitution, Manson was arrested in June in Laredo, Texas, and was returned to Los Angeles. For violating his probation on the check-cashing charge, he was ordered to serve his ten-year sentence.\nManson spent a year trying unsuccessfully to appeal the revocation of his probation. In July 1961, he was transferred from the Los Angeles County Jail to the United States Penitentiary at McNeil Island, Washington. There, he took guitar lessons from Barker\u2013Karpis gang leader Alvin \"Creepy\" Karpis, and obtained from another inmate the contact information of Phil Kaufman, a producer at Universal Studios in Hollywood. Among Manson's fellow prisoners during this time was future actor Danny Trejo; the two participated in several hypnosis sessions together. Manson's mother moved to Washington State to be closer to him during his McNeil Island incarceration, working nearby as a waitress.&lt;ref name=\"Rule/Guinn\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nAlthough the Mann Act charge had been dropped, the attempt to cash the Treasury check was still a federal offense. Manson's September 1961 annual review noted he had a \"tremendous drive to call attention to himself\", an observation echoed in September 1964. In 1963, Leona was granted a divorce. During the process, she alleged that she and Manson had a son, Charles Luther Manson. According to a popular urban legend, Manson auditioned unsuccessfully for the Monkees in late 1965. This is refuted by the fact that Manson was still incarcerated at McNeil Island at the time.\nIn June 1966, Manson was sent for the second time to Terminal Island in preparation for early release. By the time of his release day on March 21, 1967, he had spent more than half of his thirty-two years in prisons and other institutions. This was mainly because he had broken federal laws. Federal sentences were, and remain, much more severe than state sentences for many of the same offenses. Telling the authorities that prison had become his home, he requested permission to stay.\n1967\u20131968: San Francisco and cult formation.\nParolee and patient.\nLess than a month after his 1967 release, Manson moved to Berkeley from Los Angeles, which could have been a probation violation. Instead, after calling the San Francisco probation office upon his arrival, he was transferred to the supervision of criminology doctoral researcher and federal probation officer Roger Smith. Until the spring of 1968, Smith worked at the Haight Ashbury Free Medical Clinic (HAFMC), which Manson and his family came to frequent. Roger Smith, as well as the HAFMC's founder David Smith, received funding from the National Institutes of Health, and reportedly the CIA, to study the effects of drugs like LSD and methamphetamine on the counterculture movement in San Francisco's Haight\u2013Ashbury District. The patients at the HAFMC became subjects of their research, including Manson and his expanding group of mostly female followers, who came to see Roger Smith regularly.\nManson received permission from Roger Smith to move from Berkeley to the Haight-Ashbury District. He first took LSD and would use it frequently during his time there. David Smith, who had studied the effects of LSD and amphetamines in rodents, wrote that the change in Manson's personality during this time \"was the most abrupt Roger Smith had observed in his entire professional career.\" Manson also read the book \"Stranger in a Strange Land\", a science fiction novel by Robert Heinlein. \nInspired by the burgeoning free love philosophy in Haight\u2013Ashbury during the Summer of Love, Manson began preaching his own philosophy based on a mixture of \"Stranger in a Strange Land\", the Bible, Scientology, Dale Carnegie and the Beatles, which quickly earned him a following. He may have also borrowed some of his philosophy from the Process Church of the Final Judgment, whose members believed Satan would become reconciled to Jesus and they would come together at the end of the world to judge humanity.\nInvolvement with Scientology.\nManson began studying Scientology while incarcerated with the help of fellow inmate Lanier Rayner, and in July 1961 listed Scientology as his religion. A September 1961 prison report argues that Manson \"appears to have developed a certain amount of insight into his problems through his study of this discipline\". Another prison report in August 1966 stated that Manson was no longer an advocate of Scientology. Upon his release in 1967, Manson traveled to Los Angeles where he reportedly \"met local Scientologists and attended several parties for movie stars\". Manson completed 150 hours of auditing. His \"right hand man\", Bruce Davis, worked at the Church of Scientology headquarters in London from November 1968 to April 1969.\nSan Francisco followers.\nShortly after relocating to San Francisco, Manson became acquainted with Mary Brunner, a 23-year-old graduate of University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. Brunner was working as a library assistant at the University of California, Berkeley, and Manson, until that point making his living by panhandling, moved in with her. Manson then met teenaged runaway Lynette Fromme, later nicknamed \"Squeaky\", and convinced her to live with him and Brunner. According to a second-hand account, Manson overcame Brunner's initial resistance to him bringing other women in to live with them. Before long, they were sharing Brunner's residence with eighteen other women. Manson targeted individuals for manipulation who were emotionally insecure and social outcasts.\nManson established himself as a guru in Haight-Ashbury which, during the Summer of Love, was emerging as the signature hippie locale. Manson soon had the first of his groups of followers, most of them female. They were later dubbed as the \"Manson Family\" by Los Angeles prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi and the media. Manson allegedly taught his followers that they were the reincarnation of the original Christians, and that The Establishment could be characterized as the Romans.\nSometime around 1967, Manson began using the alias \"Charles Willis Manson\". Before the end of summer, he and some of his followers began traveling in an old school bus they had adapted, putting colored rugs and pillows in place of the many seats they had removed. They eventually settled in the Los Angeles areas of Topanga Canyon, Malibu and Venice along the coast. \nIn 1967, Brunner became pregnant by Manson. On April 15, 1968, she gave birth to their son, whom she named Valentine Michael, in a condemned house where they were living in Topanga Canyon. She was assisted by several of the young women from the fledgling Family. Brunner, like most members of the group, acquired a number of aliases and nicknames, including: \"Marioche\", \"Och\", \"Mother Mary\", \"Mary Manson\", \"Linda Dee Manson\" and \"Christine Marie Euchts\".\nIn his book \"Love Needs Care\" about his time at the HAFMC, David Smith claimed that Manson attempted to reprogram his followers' minds to \"submit totally to his will\" through the use of \"LSD and\u00a0... unconventional sexual practices\" that would turn his followers into \"empty vessels that would accept anything he poured\". Manson Family member Paul Watkins testified that Manson would encourage group LSD trips and take lower doses himself to \"keep his wits about him\". Watkins stated that \"Charlie's trip was to program us all to submit.\" By the end of his stay in the Haight in April 1968, Manson had attracted twenty or so followers, all under the supervision of Roger Smith and many of the staff at the HAFMC. The core members of Manson's following eventually included: Brunner; Charles \"Tex\" Watson, a musician and former actor; Bobby Beausoleil, a former musician and pornographic actor; Susan Atkins; Patricia Krenwinkel; and Leslie Van Houten.\nSubsequent arrests.\nSupervised by his ostensible parole officer Roger Smith, Manson grew his family through drug use and prostitution without interference from the authorities. Manson was arrested on July 31, 1967, for attempting to prevent the arrest of one of his followers, Ruth Ann Moorehouse. Instead of Manson being sent back to prison, the charge was reduced to a misdemeanor and Manson was given three additional years of probation. He avoided prosecution again in July 1968, when he and the family were arrested while moving to Los Angeles, after his bus crashed into a ditch. Manson and members of his family, including Brunner and Manson's newborn baby, were found sleeping naked by police. Afterwards, he was again arrested and released only a few days later, this time on a drug charge.\nInvolvement with the Beach Boys.\nOn April 6, 1968, Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys was driving through Malibu when he noticed two female hitchhikers, Krenwinkel and Ella Jo Bailey. He picked them up and dropped them off at their destination. On April 11, Wilson noticed the same two girls hitchhiking again and this time took them to his home at 14400 Sunset Boulevard. Wilson later recalled that he \"told [the girls] about our involvement with the Maharishi and they told me they too had a guru, a guy named Charlie [Manson] who'd recently come out of jail after twelve years.\" \nWilson then went to a recording session. When he returned later that night, he was met in his driveway by Manson, and when Wilson walked into his home, about a dozen people were occupying the premises, most of them young women. By Manson's own account, he had met Wilson on at least one prior occasion: at a friend's San Francisco house where Manson had gone to obtain marijuana. Manson claimed that Wilson invited him to visit his home when Manson came to Los Angeles.\nWilson was initially fascinated by Manson and his followers, referring to him as \"the Wizard\" in a \"Rave\" magazine article at the time. The two struck a friendship, and over the next few months members of the Manson Family \u2013 mostly women who were treated as servants \u2013 were housed in Wilson's residence. This arrangement persisted for about six months.\nWilson introduced Manson to a few friends in the music business, including the Byrds' producer Terry Melcher. Manson recorded numerous songs at Brian Wilson's home studio, although the recordings remain unheard by the public. Band engineer Stephen Desper said that the Manson sessions were done \"for Dennis [Wilson] and Terry Melcher\". In September 1968, Wilson recorded a Manson song for the Beach Boys, originally titled \"Cease to Exist\", but reworked as \"Never Learn Not to Love\", as a single B-side released the following December. The writing was credited solely to Wilson. When asked why Manson was not credited, Wilson explained that Manson relinquished his publishing rights in favor of \"about a hundred thousand dollars' worth of stuff\". Around this time, the Family destroyed two of Wilson's luxury cars.\nWilson eventually distanced himself from Manson and moved out of the Sunset Boulevard house, leaving the Family there, and took residence at a basement apartment in Santa Monica. Virtually all of Wilson's household possessions were stolen by the Family. The members were evicted from his home three weeks before the lease was scheduled to expire. When Manson sought further contact, he left a bullet with Wilson's housekeeper to be delivered with a threatening message.\nBand manager Nick Grillo recalled that Wilson became concerned after Manson had got \"into a much heavier drug situation ... taking a tremendous amount of acid and Dennis wouldn't tolerate it and asked him to leave. It was difficult for Dennis because he was afraid of Charlie.\" Writing in his , Mike Love recalled Wilson saying he had witnessed Manson shooting a black man \"in half\" with an M16 rifle and hiding the body inside a well. Melcher said that Wilson had been aware that the Family \"were killing people\" and had been \"so freaked out he just didn't want to live anymore. He was afraid, and he thought he should have gone to the authorities, but he didn't, and the rest of it happened.\"\nSpahn Ranch.\nManson established a base for the Family at the Spahn Ranch in August 1968, after their eviction from Wilson's residence. The ranch had been a television and movie set for Westerns, but the buildings had deteriorated by the late-1960s. The ranch then derived revenue primarily from selling horseback rides. Female Family members did chores around the ranch and, occasionally, had sex on Manson's orders with the nearly blind 80-year-old owner, George Spahn; the women also acted as guides for him. In exchange, Spahn allowed Manson and his group to live at the ranch for free.\nDoomsday beliefs.\nThe Manson Family evolved into a doomsday cult when Manson became fixated on the idea of an imminent apocalyptic race war between America's Black minority and the larger White population. A white supremacist, Manson told some of the Family that Black people would rise up and kill the entire White population except for Manson and his followers, but they were not intelligent enough to survive on their own. They needed a white man to lead them, and so they would serve Manson as their \"master\". In late-1968, Manson adopted the term \"Helter Skelter\", taken from a song on the Beatles' recently released \"White Album\", to refer to this upcoming war.\nTate encounter.\nOn March 23, 1969, Manson entered the grounds of 10050 Cielo Drive, which he had known as Melcher's residence. He was not invited. As he approached the main house, Manson was met by Shahrokh Hatami, an Iranian photographer who had befriended film director Roman Polanski and his wife Sharon Tate during the making of the documentary \"Mia and Roman\". Hatami was there to photograph Tate before she departed for Rome the following day. Seeing Manson approach, Hatami went onto the front porch to ask him what he wanted. \nManson said that he was looking for Melcher, whose name Hatami did not recognize. Hatami told him the place was the Polanski residence and then advised him to try the path to the guest house beyond the main house. Tate appeared behind Hatami in the house's front door and asked him who was calling. Hatami and Tate maintained their positions while Manson went back to the guest house without a word, returned to the front a minute or two later and left.\nThat evening, Manson returned to the property and again went to the guest house. He entered the enclosed porch and spoke with Altobelli, the owner, who had just come out of the shower. Manson asked for Melcher, but Altobelli felt that Manson was instead looking for him. It was later discovered that Manson had apparently been to the property on earlier occasions after Melcher left. Altobelli told Manson through the screen door that Melcher had moved to Malibu and said that he did not know his new address, although he did.\nAltobelli told Manson he was leaving the country the next day, and Manson said he would like to speak with him upon his return. Altobelli said that he would be gone for more than a year. Manson said that he had been directed to the guest house by the persons in the main house; Altobelli asked Manson not to disturb his tenants. Altobelli and Tate flew together to Rome the next day. Tate asked him whether \"that creepy-looking guy\" had gone to see him at the guest house the day before.\n1969\u20131971: Crimes and trial.\nCrowe shooting.\nTex Watson became involved in drug dealing and robbed a 22-year-old rival named Bernard \"Lotsapoppa\" Crowe. Crowe allegedly responded with a threat to kill everyone at Spahn Ranch. In response, Manson shot Crowe on July 1, 1969, at Manson's Hollywood apartment. Manson's belief that he had killed Crowe was seemingly confirmed by a news report of the discovery of the dumped body of a Black Panther in Los Angeles.\nAlthough Crowe was not a member of the Black Panthers, Manson concluded he had been and expected retaliation from the Panthers. He turned Spahn Ranch into a defensive camp, establishing night patrols by armed guards. Watson would later write, \"Blackie was trying to get at the chosen ones.\" Manson brought in members of the Straight Satans Motorcycle Club to act as security.\nHinman murder.\n34-year-old Gary Alan Hinman, a music teacher and graduate student at UCLA, had previously befriended members of the Family and allowed some to occasionally stay at his home in Topanga Canyon. According to Atkins, Manson believed Hinman was wealthy and sent her, Brunner, and Beausoleil to Hinman's home to convince him to join the Family and turn over the assets Manson thought Hinman had inherited. The three held Hinman hostage for two days in late July 1969, as he denied having any money. During this time, Manson arrived with a sword and slashed his face and ear. After that, Beausoleil stabbed Hinman to death, allegedly on Manson's instruction. Before leaving the residence, Beausoleil or one of the women used Hinman's blood to write \"political piggy\" on the wall and to draw a panther paw, a Black Panther symbol.\nAccording to Beausoleil, he came to Hinman's house to recover money paid to Hinman for mescaline provided to the Straight Satans, that had supposedly been bad. Beausoleil added that Brunner and Atkins, unaware of his intent, went along to visit Hinman. Atkins, in her 1977 autobiography, wrote that Manson directed Beausoleil, Brunner and her to go to Hinman's and get the supposed inheritance of $21,000. She said that two days earlier Manson had told her privately that, if she wanted to \"do something important\", she could kill Hinman and get his money. Beausoleil was arrested on August 6, 1969, after he was caught driving Hinman's car. Police found the murder weapon in the tire well.\nTate murders.\nOn the night of August 8, 1969, Watson took Atkins, Krenwinkel and Linda Kasabian to 10050 Cielo Drive. Watson later claimed that Manson had instructed him to go to the house and \"totally destroy\" everyone in it, and to do it \"as gruesome as you can\". Manson told the women to do as Watson instructed them.\nThe occupants of the Cielo Drive house that evening were Tate, aged 26, who was 8&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 months pregnant; her friend and former lover 35-year-old Jay Sebring, a noted celebrity hairstylist; Polanski's friend 32-year-old Wojciech Frykowski; and Frykowski's 25-year-old girlfriend Abigail Anne Folger, heiress to the Folgers coffee fortune and daughter of Peter Folger. Also present on the property were 19-year-old caretaker William Garretson and his friend, 18-year-old Steven Earl Parent. Polanski was in Europe working on a film. Music producer Quincy Jones was a friend of Sebring who had planned to join him that evening before changing his mind.\nWatson and the three women arrived at Cielo Drive just past midnight on August 9. Watson climbed a telephone pole near the entrance gate and cut the phone line to the house. The group then backed their car to the bottom of the hill that led to the estate before walking back up to the house. Thinking that the gate might be electrified or equipped with an alarm, they climbed a brushy embankment to the right of the gate and entered the grounds. \nHeadlights approached the group from within the property, and Watson ordered the women to lie in the bushes. He stepped out and ordered the approaching driver, Parent, to halt. Watson leveled a .22 caliber revolver at Parent, who begged him not to hurt him, claiming that he would not say anything. Watson lunged at Parent with a knife, giving him a defensive slash wound on the palm of his hand that severed tendons and tore the boy's watch off his wrist, then shot him four times in the chest and abdomen, killing him in the front seat of his white 1965 AMC Ambassador coupe. Watson ordered the women to help push the car up the driveway.\nWatson next cut the screen of a window, then told Kasabian to keep watch down by the gate; she walked over to Parent's car and waited. Watson removed the screen, entered through the window and let Atkins and Krenwinkel in through the front door. He whispered to Atkins and awoke Frykowski, who was sleeping on the living room couch. Watson kicked him in the head, and Frykowski asked him who he was and what he was doing there. Watson replied, \"I'm the devil, and I'm here to do the devil's business.\"\nOn Watson's direction, Atkins found the house's three other occupants with Krenwinkel's help and forced them to the living room. Watson began to tie Tate and Sebring together by their necks with a long nylon rope which he had brought, then slung it over one of the living room's ceiling beams. Sebring protested the rough treatment of the pregnant Tate, so Watson shot him. Folger was taken momentarily back to her bedroom for her purse, and she gave the murderers $70. Watson then stabbed Sebring seven times. Frykowski's hands had been bound with a towel, but he freed himself and began struggling with Atkins, who stabbed at his legs with a knife. He fought his way out the front door and onto the porch, but Watson caught up with him, struck him over the head with the gun multiple times, stabbed him repeatedly and shot him twice.\nKasabian had heard \"horrifying sounds\" and moved toward the house from her position in the driveway. She told Atkins that someone was coming in an attempt to stop the murders. Inside the house, Folger escaped from Krenwinkel and fled out a bedroom door to the pool area. Krenwinkel pursued her and caught her on the front lawn, where she stabbed her and tackled her to the ground. Watson then helped kill her; her assailants stabbed her a total of twenty-eight times. Frykowski struggled across the lawn, but Watson continued to stab him, killing him. Frykowski suffered fifty-one stab wounds, and had also been struck thirteen times in the head with the butt of Watson's gun, that bent the barrel and broke off one side of the gun grip, which was recovered at the scene.\nIn the house, Tate pleaded to be allowed to live long enough to give birth and offered herself as a hostage in an attempt to save the life of her unborn child. Instead both Atkins and Watson stabbed Tate sixteen times, killing her. The coroner's inquest found that Tate was still alive when she was hanged with the nylon rope, although the cause of her death was determined as a \"massive hemorrhage\", while in Sebring's murder it was found that he was hanged lifeless.\nAccording to Watson, Manson had told the women to \"leave a sign\u2014something witchy\". Atkins wrote \"pig\" on the front door in Tate's blood. Atkins claims she did this to copycat the Hinman murder scene in order to get Beausoleil out of jail, who was in custody for that murder.\nLaBianca murders.\nThe four murderers plus Manson, Leslie Van Houten and Clem Grogan went for a drive the following night. Manson was allegedly displeased with the previous night's murders, so he told Kasabian to drive to a house at 3301 Waverly Drive in the Los Feliz section of Los Angeles. Located next door to a home where Manson and Family members had attended a party the previous year, it belonged to 44-year-old supermarket executive Leno LaBianca and his 43-year-old wife, Rosemary LaBianca, co-owner of a dress shop.\nAccording to Atkins and Kasabian, Manson disappeared up the driveway and returned to say that he had tied up the house's occupants. Watson, Krenwinkel and Van Houten entered the property. Watson claims in his autobiography that Manson went up alone, then returned to take him up to the house with him. Manson pointed out a sleeping man through a window, and the two entered through the unlocked back door. Watson claims Manson roused the sleeping Leno LaBianca from the couch at gunpoint and had Watson bind his hands with a leather thong. Rosemary was brought into the living room from the bedroom, and Watson covered the couple's heads with pillowcases which he bound in place with lamp cords. Manson left, and Krenwinkel and Van Houten entered the house.\nWatson had complained to Manson earlier of the inadequacy of the previous night's weapons. Watson sent the women from the kitchen to the bedroom, where Rosemary LaBianca had been returned, while he went to the living room and began stabbing Leno LaBianca with a chrome-plated bayonet. The first thrust went into his throat. Watson heard a scuffle in the bedroom and went in there to discover Rosemary LaBianca keeping the women at bay by swinging the lamp tied to her neck. He stabbed her several times with the bayonet, then returned to the living room and resumed attacking Leno, whom he stabbed a total of twelve times. He then carved the word \"WAR\" into his abdomen.\nWatson returned to the bedroom and found Krenwinkel stabbing Rosemary with a knife from the kitchen. Van Houten stabbed her approximately sixteen times in the back and the exposed buttocks. Van Houten claimed at trial that Rosemary LaBianca was already dead during the stabbing. Evidence showed that many of the forty-one stab wounds had, in fact, been inflicted post-mortem. Watson then cleaned off the bayonet and showered, while Krenwinkel wrote \"Rise\" and \"Death to pigs\" on the walls and \"Healter [sic] Skelter\" on the refrigerator door, all in LaBianca's blood. She gave Leno LaBianca fourteen puncture wounds with an ivory-handled, two-tined carving fork, which she left jutting out of his stomach. She also planted a steak knife in his throat.\nMeanwhile, Manson drove the other three Family members who had departed Spahn with him that evening to the Venice home of the Lebanese actor Saladin Nader. Manson left them there and drove back to Spahn Ranch, leaving them and the LaBianca killers to hitchhike home. According to Kasabian, Manson wanted his followers to murder Nader in his apartment, but Kasabian claims she thwarted this murder by deliberately knocking on the wrong apartment door and waking a stranger. The group abandoned the murder plan and left, but Atkins defecated in the stairwell on the way out.\nShea murder.\n35-year-old Hollywood stuntman Donald Jerome \"Shorty\" Shea was murdered on August 26, 1969, more than two weeks after the Tate\u2013LaBianca murders, when Manson told Shea, Bruce Davis, Tex Watson, and Steve Grogan to go on a ride to a nearby car parts yard on the Spahn Ranch. According to Davis, he sat in the back seat with Grogan, who then hit Shea with a pipe wrench and Watson stabbed him. They brought Shea down a hill behind the ranch and stabbed and brutally tortured him to death. Bruce Davis recalled at his parole hearings:\nIn December 1977, Shea's skeletal remains were discovered on an undistinguished hillside near Santa Susana Road next to Spahn Ranch after Grogan, one of those convicted of the murder, agreed to aid authorities in the recovery of Shea's body by drawing a map to its location. According to the autopsy report, his body suffered multiple stab and chopping wounds to the chest, and blunt force trauma to the head.\nSuspected murders.\nIn total, Manson and his followers were convicted of nine counts of first-degree murder. However, the LAPD believes that the Family could have claimed up to twelve more victims. Cliff Shepard, a former LAPD Robbery-Homicide Division detective, said that Manson \"repeatedly\" claimed to have killed many others. Prosecutor Stephen Kay supported this assertion: \"I know that Manson one time told one of his cellmates that he was responsible for 35 murders.\" Tate's younger sister, Debra Tate, has also claimed that investigators are \"just scraping the surface\" when it comes to the number of Manson's victims and has further elaborated on how Manson sent her a taunting map of the Panamint Range, with crosses on it that she believed were meant to represent buried bodies. This has resulted in several excavations that have been undertaken at Manson's Barker Ranch, but they have not resulted in any bodies being found. \nInvestigation.\nThe Tate murders became national news on August 9, 1969, after the Polanskis' housekeeper, Winifred Chapman, arrived for work that morning. On August 10, detectives of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, which had jurisdiction in the Hinman case, informed Los Angeles Police Department detectives assigned to the Tate case of the bloody writing at the Hinman house. According to Vincent Bugliosi, because detectives believed the Tate murders were a consequence of a drug transaction, the Tate team initially ignored this and other evidence of similarities between the crimes.\nDuring the Tate autopsies, detectives working on the Hinman case noticed similarities in the weapons used, the stab wounds, and the writing in blood on the walls. They brought the information to detectives working on the Tate murders. According to Detective Charlie Guenther, \"Vince [Bugliosi] didn't want anything to do with the Hinman case. Hinman was a nothing case. Vince didn't want to prosecute it.\"\nHeld briefly as a Tate suspect, Garretson told police he had neither seen nor heard anything on the murder night. He was released on August 11, 1969, after undergoing a polygraph examination that indicated he had not been involved in the crimes. The LaBianca crime scene was discovered at 10:30\u00a0p.m. on August 10, approximately nineteen hours after the murders were committed, when 15-year-old Frank Struthers, Rosemary's son from a prior marriage and Leno's stepson, returned from a camping trip.\nOn August 12, 1969, the LAPD told the press it had ruled out any connection between the Tate and LaBianca homicides. On August 16, the sheriff's office raided Spahn Ranch and arrested Manson and twenty-five others, as \"suspects in a major auto theft ring\" that had been stealing Volkswagen Beetles and converting them into dune buggies. Weapons were seized, but because the search warrant had been misdated, the group was released a few days later. In a report at the end of August, the LaBianca detectives noted a possible connection between the bloody writings at the LaBianca house and \"the singing group the Beatles' most recent album.\"\nStill working separately from the Tate team, the LaBianca team checked with the sheriff's office in mid-October about possible similar crimes. They learned of the Hinman case and also learned that the Hinman detectives had spoken with Beausoleil's girlfriend, Kitty Lutesinger. She had been arrested a few days earlier with members of the Manson Family.\nThe arrests, for car thefts, had taken place at the desert ranches to which the Family had moved. A joint force of National Park Service Rangers and officers from the California Highway Patrol and the Inyo County Sheriff's Office: federal, state, and county personnel, had raided both the Myers and Barker ranches after following evidence left when Family members had burned an earthmover owned by Death Valley National Monument. The raiders had found stolen dune buggies and other vehicles, and arrested two dozen people, including Manson. A Highway Patrol officer found Manson hiding in a cabinet beneath Barker's bathroom sink.\nFollowing up leads a month after they had spoken with Lutesinger, LaBianca detectives contacted members of a motorcycle gang Manson tried to recruit as bodyguards while the Family was at Spahn Ranch. Meanwhile, a dormitory mate of Susan Atkins informed LAPD of the Family's involvement in the crimes. Atkins was booked for the Hinman murder after she told sheriff's detectives that she had been involved in it. Transferred to Sybil Brand Institute, a detention center in Monterey Park, California, she had begun talking to bunkmates Ronnie Howard and Virginia Graham, to whom she gave accounts of the events in which she had been involved.\nApprehension.\nOn December 1, 1969, the LAPD announced warrants for the arrest of Watson, Krenwinkel, and Kasabian in the Tate case; the suspects' involvement in the LaBianca murders was noted. Manson and Atkins, already in custody, were not mentioned. The connection between the LaBianca case and Van Houten, who was also among those arrested near Death Valley, had not yet been recognized. Watson and Krenwinkel were already under arrest, with authorities in McKinney, Texas, and Mobile, Alabama, having picked them up on notice from LAPD. Informed that a warrant was out for her arrest, Kasabian voluntarily surrendered to authorities in Concord, New Hampshire on December 2.\nPhysical evidence such as Krenwinkel's and Watson's fingerprints, which had been collected by LAPD at Cielo Drive, was augmented by evidence recovered by the public. On September 1, 1969, the distinctive .22-caliber Hi Standard \"Buntline Special\" revolver Watson used on Parent, Sebring, and Frykowski had been found and given to the police by Steven Weiss, a 10-year-old who lived near the Tate residence. In mid-December, when the \"Los Angeles Times\" published a crime account based on information Susan Atkins had given her attorney, Weiss's father made several phone calls which finally prompted LAPD to locate the gun in its evidence file and connect it with the murders via ballistics tests.\nActing on that same newspaper account, a local ABC television crew quickly located and recovered the bloody clothing discarded by the Tate killers. The knives discarded en route from the Tate residence were never recovered, despite a search by some of the same crewmen and by LAPD. A knife found behind the cushion of a chair in the Tate living room was apparently that of Susan Atkins, who lost her knife in the course of the attack.\nThe trial began on June 15, 1970. The prosecution's main witness was Kasabian, who, along with Manson, Atkins, and Krenwinkel, had been charged with seven counts of murder and one of conspiracy. Since Kasabian, by all accounts, had not participated in the killings, she was granted immunity in exchange for testimony that detailed the nights of the crimes. Originally, a deal had been made with Atkins in which the prosecution agreed not to seek the death penalty against her in exchange for her grand jury testimony on which the indictments were secured; once Atkins repudiated that testimony, the deal was withdrawn. Because Van Houten had participated only in the LaBianca killings, she was charged with two counts of murder and one of conspiracy.\nOriginally, Judge William Keene had reluctantly granted Manson permission to act as his own attorney. Due to Manson's conduct, including violations of a gag order and submission of \"outlandish\" and \"nonsensical\" pretrial motions, the permission was withdrawn before the trial's start. Manson filed an affidavit of prejudice against Keene, who was replaced by Judge Charles Older. On Friday, July 24, the first day of testimony, Manson appeared in court with an X carved into his forehead. He issued a statement that he was \"considered inadequate and incompetent to speak or defend [him]self\"\u2014and had \"X'd [him]self from [the establishment's] world.\" Over the following weekend, the female defendants duplicated the mark on their own foreheads, as did most Family members within another day or so.\nThe prosecution argued the triggering of \"Helter Skelter\" was Manson's main motive. The crime scene's bloody White Album reference, \"helter skelter\" and the writing of \"pigs\" was correlated with testimony about Manson predictions that the murders Black people would commit at the outset of Helter Skelter would involve the writing of \"pigs\" on walls in victims' blood. The defendants testified that the writing in blood on the walls was to copy that of the Hinman murder scene, not an apocalyptic race war. According to Bugliosi, Manson directed Kasabian to hide a wallet taken from the scene in the women's restroom of a service station near a Black neighborhood. However, as co-prosecutor Stephen Kay later pointed out the wallet was left about twenty miles away in a predominantly White neighborhood, Sylmar.\nOngoing disruptions.\nDuring the trial, Family members loitered near the entrances and corridors of the courthouse. To keep them out of the courtroom proper, the prosecution subpoenaed them as prospective witnesses, who would not be able to enter while others were testifying. When the group established itself in vigil on the sidewalk, some members wore sheathed hunting knives that, although in plain view, were carried legally. Each of them was also identifiable by the X on their forehead.\nSome Family members attempted to dissuade witnesses from testifying. Prosecution witnesses Paul Watkins and Juan Flynn were both threatened; Watkins was badly burned in a suspicious fire in his van. Former Family member Barbara Hoyt, who had overheard Susan Atkins describing the Tate murders to Family member Ruth Ann Moorehouse, agreed to accompany the latter to Hawaii. There, Moorehouse allegedly gave her a hamburger spiked with several doses of LSD. Found sprawled on a Honolulu curb in a drugged semi-stupor, Hoyt was taken to the hospital, where she did her best to identify herself as a witness in the Tate\u2013LaBianca murder trial. Before the incident, Hoyt had been a reluctant witness. After the attempt to silence her, her reticence disappeared.\nOn August 4, despite precautions taken by the court, Manson flashed the jury a \"Los Angeles Times\" front page whose headline was \"Manson Guilty, Nixon Declares\". This was a reference to a statement made the previous day when U.S. President Richard Nixon had decried what he saw as the media's glamorization of Manson. Voir dired by Judge Charles Older, the jurors contended that the headline had not influenced them. The next day, the female defendants stood up and said in unison that, in light of Nixon's remark, there was no point in going on with the trial.\nOn October 5, Manson was denied the court's permission to question a prosecution witness whom defense attorneys had declined to cross-examine. Leaping over the defense table, Manson attempted to attack the judge. Wrestled to the ground by bailiffs, he was removed from the courtroom with the female defendants, who had subsequently risen and begun chanting in Latin. Thereafter, Older allegedly began wearing a revolver under his robes.\nDefense rests.\nOn November 16, the prosecution rested its case. Three days later, after arguing standard dismissal motions, the defense stunned the court by resting as well, without calling a single witness. Shouting their disapproval, Atkins, Krenwinkel, and Van Houten demanded their right to testify.\nIn chambers, the women's lawyers told the judge their clients wanted to testify that they had planned and committed the crimes and that Manson had not been involved. By resting their case, the defense lawyers had tried to stop this. Van Houten's attorney, Ronald Hughes, vehemently stated that he would not \"push a client out the window\". In the prosecutor's view, it was Manson who was advising the women to testify in this way as a means of saving himself. Speaking about the trial in a 1987 documentary, Krenwinkel said, \"The entire proceedings were scripted\u2014by Charlie.\"\nThe next day, Manson testified. The jury was removed from the courtroom. According to Vincent Bugliosi it was to make sure Manson's address did not violate the California Supreme Court's decision in \"People v. Aranda\" by making statements implicating his co-defendants. However, Bugliosi argued Manson would use his hypnotic powers to unfairly influence the jury. Speaking for more than an hour, Manson said, among other things, that \"the music is telling the youth to rise up against the establishment.\" He said, \"Why blame it on me? I didn't write the music.\" \"To be honest with you,\" Manson also stated, \"I don't recall ever saying 'Get a knife and a change of clothes and go do what Tex says.'\"\nAs the body of the trial concluded and with the closing arguments impending, defense attorney Hughes disappeared during a weekend trip. When Maxwell Keith was appointed to represent Van Houten in Hughes' absence, a delay of more than two weeks was required to permit Keith to familiarize himself with the voluminous trial transcripts. No sooner had the trial resumed, just before Christmas, than disruptions of the prosecution's closing argument by the defendants led Older to ban the four defendants from the courtroom for the remainder of the guilt phase. This may have occurred because the defendants were acting in collusion with each other and were simply putting on a performance, which Older said was becoming obvious.\nConviction and penalty phase.\nOn January 25, 1971, the jury returned guilty verdicts against the four defendants on each of the twenty-seven separate counts against them. Not far into the trial's penalty phase, the jurors saw the defense that Manson\u2014in the prosecution's view\u2014had planned to present. Atkins, Krenwinkel, and Van Houten testified the murders had been conceived as \"copycat\" versions of the Hinman murder, for which Atkins now took credit. The killings, they said, were intended to draw suspicion away from Bobby Beausoleil by resembling the crime for which he had been jailed. This plan had supposedly been the work of, and carried out under the guidance of, not Manson, but someone allegedly in love with Beausoleil\u2014Linda Kasabian. Among the narrative's weak points was the inability of Atkins to explain why, as she was maintaining, she had written \"political piggy\" at the Hinman house in the first place.\nMidway through the penalty phase, Manson shaved his head and trimmed his beard to a fork; he told the press, \"I am the Devil, and the Devil always has a bald head.\" In what the prosecution regarded as belated recognition on their part that imitation of Manson only proved his domination, the female defendants refrained from shaving their heads until the jurors retired to weigh the state's request for the death penalty. The effort to exonerate Manson via the \"copycat\" scenario failed. On March 29, 1971, the jury returned verdicts of death against all four defendants on all counts. On April 19, 1971, Judge Older sentenced the four to death.\n1971\u20132017: Third imprisonment.\n1970s\u20131980s.\nManson was admitted to state prison from Los Angeles County on April 22, 1971, for seven counts of first-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of Abigail Ann Folger, Wojciech Frykowski, Steven Earl Parent, Sharon Tate Polanski, Jay Sebring, and Leno and Rosemary LaBianca. In 1972, the California Supreme Court ruled that the state's death penalty statutes was unconstitutional, and subsequently Manson was re-sentenced to life with the possibility of parole. His initial death sentence was modified to life on February\u00a02, 1977.\nOn December 13, 1971, Manson was convicted of first-degree murder in Los Angeles County Court for the July 25, 1969, death of musician Gary Hinman. He was also convicted of first-degree murder for the August 1969 death of Donald Shea. Following the 1972 decision of \"California v. Anderson\", California's death sentences were ruled unconstitutional and that \"any prisoner now under a sentence of death ... may file a petition for writ of \"habeas corpus\" in the superior court inviting that court to modify its judgment to provide for the appropriate alternative punishment of life imprisonment or life imprisonment without possibility of parole specified by statute for the crime for which he was sentenced to death.\" Manson was thus eligible to apply for parole after seven years' incarceration. His first parole hearing took place on November 16, 1978, at California Medical Facility in Vacaville, where his petition was rejected.\nGerald Ford assassination attempt.\nOn September 5, 1975, the Family returned to national attention when Squeaky Fromme attempted to assassinate U.S. President Gerald Ford. The attempt took place in Sacramento, to which she and fellow Manson follower Sandra Good had moved so that they could be near Manson while he was incarcerated at Folsom State Prison. A subsequent search of the apartment shared by Fromme, Good, and another Family recruit turned up evidence that, coupled with later actions on the part of Good, resulted in Good's conviction for conspiring to send threatening communications through the United States mail service and for transmitting death threats by way of interstate commerce. The threats involved corporate executives and U.S. government officials vis-\u00e0-vis supposed environmental dereliction on their part.\nFromme was sentenced to 15 years to life, becoming the first person sentenced under United States Code Title 18, chapter 84 (1965), which made it a federal crime to attempt to assassinate the President of the United States. In December 1987, Fromme, serving a life sentence for the assassination attempt, escaped briefly from Federal Prison Camp, Alderson in West Virginia. She was trying to reach Manson because she heard that he had testicular cancer; she was apprehended within days. She was released on parole from Federal Medical Center, Carswell on August 14, 2009.\n1980s\u20131990s.\nIn the 1980s, Manson gave four interviews to the mainstream media. The first, recorded at California Medical Facility and aired on June 13, 1981, was by Tom Snyder for NBC's \"The Tomorrow Show\". The second, recorded at San Quentin State Prison and aired on March 7, 1986, was by Charlie Rose for \"CBS News Nightwatch\", and it won the national news Emmy Award for Best Interview in 1987. The third, with Geraldo Rivera in 1988, was part of the journalist's prime-time special on Satanism. At least as early as the Snyder interview, Manson's forehead bore a swastika in the spot where the X carved during his trial had been. Nikolas Schreck conducted an interview with Manson for his documentary \"Charles Manson Superstar\". Schreck concluded Manson was not insane, but merely acting that way out of frustration.\nOn September 25, 1984, Manson was imprisoned in the California Medical Facility at Vacaville when inmate Jan Holmstrom poured paint thinner on him and set him on fire, causing second and third degree burns on over 20\u00a0percent of his body. Holmstrom explained that Manson had objected to his Hare Krishna chants and verbally threatened him. After 1989, Manson was housed in the Protective Housing Unit at California State Prison, Corcoran, in Kings County. The unit housed inmates whose safety would be endangered by general-population housing. He had also been housed at San Quentin State Prison, California Medical Facility in Vacaville, Folsom State Prison and Pelican Bay State Prison.\nIn June 1997, a prison disciplinary committee found that Manson had been trafficking drugs. He was moved from Corcoran State Prison to Pelican Bay State Prison a month later.\n2000s\u20132017.\nOn September 5, 2007, MSNBC aired \"The Mind of Manson\", a complete version of a 1987 interview at California's San Quentin State Prison. The footage of the \"unshackled, unapologetic, and unruly\" Manson had been considered \"so unbelievable\" that only seven minutes of it had originally been broadcast on \"Today\", for which it had been recorded.\nIn 2009, Los Angeles disc jockey Matthew Roberts released correspondence and other evidence indicating that he might be Manson's biological son. Roberts' biological mother claims that she was a member of the Manson Family who left in mid-1967 after being raped by Manson. She returned to her parents' home to complete the pregnancy, gave birth on March 22, 1968, and put Roberts up for adoption. CNN conducted a DNA test between Matthew Roberts and Manson's known biological grandson Jason Freeman in 2012, showing that Roberts and Freeman did not share DNA. Roberts subsequently attempted to establish that Manson was his father through a direct DNA test which proved definitively that Roberts and Manson were not related.\nIn 2010, the \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that Manson was caught with a cell phone in 2009 and had contacted people in California, New Jersey, Florida and British Columbia. A spokesperson for the California Department of Corrections stated that it was not known if Manson had used the phone for criminal purposes. Manson also recorded an album of acoustic pop songs with additional production by Henry Rollins, titled \"Completion\". Only five copies were pressed: two belong to Rollins, while the other three are presumed to have been with Manson. The album remains unreleased.\nIn 2013, Manson stated that he was bisexual, saying \"Sex to me is like going to the toilet. Whether it's a girl or not. It doesn't matter. I don't play that girl-guy shit. I'm not hung up in that game.\" In 2014, the imprisoned Manson became engaged to 26-year-old Afton Elaine Burton and obtained a marriage license on November 7. Manson gave Burton the nickname \"Star\". She had been visiting him in prison for at least nine years and maintained several websites that proclaimed his innocence. The wedding license expired on February 5, 2015, without a marriage ceremony taking place. \nJournalist Daniel Simone reported that the wedding was canceled after Manson discovered that Burton wanted to marry him only so that she and friend Craig Hammond could use his corpse as a tourist attraction after his death. According to Simone, Manson believed that he would never die and may simply have used the possibility of marriage as a way to encourage Burton and Hammond to continue visiting him and bringing him gifts. Burton said on her website that the reason that the marriage did not take place was merely logistical. Manson had an infection and had been in a prison medical facility for two months and could not receive visitors. She said that she still hoped that the marriage license would be renewed and the marriage would take place.\nPsychology.\nOn April 11, 2012, Manson was denied release at his twelfth parole hearing, which he did not attend. After his March 27, 1997, parole hearing, Manson refused to attend any of his later hearings. The panel at that hearing noted that Manson had a \"history of controlling behavior\" and \"mental health issues\" including schizophrenia and paranoid delusional disorder, and was too great a danger to be released. The panel noted that Manson had received 108 rules violation reports, had no indication of remorse, no insight into the causative factors of the crimes, lacked understanding of the magnitude of the crimes, had an exceptional, callous disregard for human suffering and had no parole plans. \nAt the April 11, 2012, parole hearing, it was determined that Manson would not be reconsidered for parole for another fifteen years, not before 2027, at which time he would have been 92. In a 2023 re-analysis of Manson's psychological state, researchers suggest that he may have been misdiagnosed with schizophrenia. They propose that Manson had bipolar disorder and psychopathy.\nIllness and death.\nOn January 1, 2017, Manson was being held at Corcoran Prison, when he was rushed to Mercy Hospital in downtown Bakersfield, because he had gastrointestinal bleeding. A source told the \"Los Angeles Times\" that Manson was very ill, and TMZ reported that his doctors considered him \"too weak\" for surgery that normally would be performed in cases such as his. He was returned to prison on January 6, and the nature of his treatment was not disclosed. On November 15, 2017, an unauthorized source said that Manson had returned to a hospital in Bakersfield, but the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation did not confirm this in conformity with state and federal medical privacy laws. He died from cardiac arrest resulting from respiratory failure, brought on by colon cancer, at the hospital on November 19.\nThree people stated their intention to claim Manson's estate and body. Manson's grandson Jason Freeman stated his intent to take possession of Manson's remains and personal effects. Manson's pen-pal Michael Channels claimed to have a Manson will dated February 14, 2002, which left Manson's entire estate and Manson's body to Channels. Manson's friend Ben Gurecki claimed to have a Manson will dated January 2017 which gives the estate and Manson's body to Matthew Roberts, another alleged son of Manson. \nIn 2012, CNN ran a DNA match to see if Freeman and Roberts were related to each other and found that they were not. According to CNN, two prior attempts to DNA-match Roberts with genetic material from Manson failed, but the results were reportedly contaminated. On March 12, 2018, the Kern County Superior Court in California decided in favor of Freeman in regard to Manson's body. A funeral service was held for Manson on March 17, 2018, after which Freeman had his remains cremated and scattered on a California hillside.\nLegacy.\nCultural impact.\nIn June 1970, \"Rolling Stone\" made Manson their cover story. Bernardine Dohrn of the Weather Underground reportedly said of the Tate murders: \"Dig it, first they killed those pigs, then they ate dinner in the same room with them, then they even shoved a fork into the pig Tate's stomach! Wild!\" Manson fanatic James Mason claimed to be acting on a suggestion from Charles Manson based on his interpretation of something Manson said in a televised interview, when Mason founded the Universal Order, a neo-Nazi group that has influenced other movements such as the terrorist group the Atomwaffen Division. Bugliosi quoted a BBC employee's assertion that a \"neo-Manson cult\" existed in Europe, represented by approximately 70 rock bands playing songs by Manson and \"songs in support of him\".\nThe names of the \"Star Wars\" characters Luke Skywalker and his father Anakin Skywalker were influenced by Manson's reputation. Written between January 1973 and March 1976, screenplays for \"Star Wars\" (1977) had used the names Luke and Annikin Starkiller, but after production of the movie began, George Lucas changed the surname to Skywalker. In 2007, Lucas explained \"[he] felt a lot of people [on set] were confusing him with someone like Charles Manson. It had very unpleasant connotations.\" \u2014 Starkiller could be misconstrued as \"celebrity killer\" in a time when coverage on Manson was renewed following Fromme's attempted assassination of Gerald Ford, and Hollywood productions incorporated increased themes of sexual violence and gore following the sensationalizing of the Tate\u2013LaBianca murders.\nMusic.\nManson was a struggling pop musician, seeking to make it big in Hollywood between 1967 and 1969. The Beach Boys recorded one of his songs. Other songs were publicly released only after the trial for the Tate murders started. On March 6, 1970, \"\", an album of Manson music, was released. This included \"Cease to Exist\", a Manson song the Beach Boys had recorded with modified lyrics and the title \"Never Learn Not to Love\". Over the next couple of months only about 300 of the album's 2,000 copies sold.\nThere have been several other releases of Manson recordings \u2013 both musical and spoken. One of these, \"The Family Jams\", includes two compact discs of Manson's songs recorded by the Family in 1970, after Manson and the others had been arrested. Guitar and lead vocals are supplied by Steve Grogan; additional vocals are supplied by Lynette Fromme, Sandra Good, Catherine Share, and others. \"One Mind\", an album of music, poetry, and spoken word, new at the time of its release, in April 2005, was put out under a Creative Commons license.\nAmerican rock band Guns N' Roses recorded Manson's \"Look at Your Game, Girl\", included as an unlisted 13th track on their 1993 album \"The Spaghetti Incident?\". \"My Monkey\", which appears on \"Portrait of an American Family\" by the American rock band Marilyn Manson, includes the lyrics \"I had a little monkey / I sent him to the country and I fed him on gingerbread / Along came a choo-choo / Knocked my monkey cuckoo / And now my monkey's dead.\" These lyrics are from Manson's \"Mechanical Man\", which is heard on \"\". Crispin Glover covered \"Never Say 'Never' to Always\" on his album \"The Big Problem \u2260 The Solution. The Solution=Let It Be\" released in 1989.\nMusical performers such as Kasabian, Spahn Ranch, and Marilyn Manson derived their names from Manson and his lore.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nLegal documents\nNews articles"}
{"id": "42636", "revid": "37371155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42636", "title": "Hubert Humphrey", "text": "Vice President of the United States from 1965 to 1969\nHubert Horatio Humphrey Jr. (May 27, 1911 \u2013 January 13, 1978) was the 38th vice president of the United States, serving from 1965 to 1969 under President Lyndon B. Johnson. A member of the Democratic Party, he twice served in the United States Senate, representing Minnesota from 1949 to 1964 and from 1971 to 1978. As a senator, he was a major leader of modern liberalism in the United States, while as vice president, he supported the controversial Vietnam War. An intensely divided Democratic Party nominated him in the 1968 presidential election, which he lost to Republican nominee Richard Nixon.\nBorn in Wallace, South Dakota, Humphrey attended the University of Minnesota. In 1943, he became a professor of political science at Macalester College and ran a failed campaign for mayor of Minneapolis. He helped found the Minnesota Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor Party (DFL) in 1944; the next year he was elected mayor of Minneapolis, serving until 1948 and co-founding the left-wing non-communist group Americans for Democratic Action in 1947. In 1948, he was elected to the U.S. Senate and successfully advocated for the inclusion of a proposal to end racial segregation in the 1948 Democratic National Convention's party platform.\nHumphrey served three terms in the Senate from 1949 to 1964, and was the Senate Majority Whip for the last four years of his tenure. During this time, he was the lead author of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, introduced the first initiative to create the Peace Corps, and chaired the Select Committee on Disarmament. He unsuccessfully sought his party's presidential nomination in 1952 and 1960. After Lyndon B. Johnson acceded to the presidency, he chose Humphrey as his running mate, and the Democratic ticket won a landslide victory in the 1964 election.\nIn March 1968, Johnson made his surprise announcement that he would not seek reelection, and Humphrey launched his campaign for the presidency. Loyal to the Johnson administration's policies on the Vietnam War, he received opposition from many within his own party and avoided the primaries to focus on winning the delegates of non-primary states at the Democratic National Convention. His delegate strategy succeeded in clinching the nomination, and he chose Senator Edmund Muskie as his running mate. In the general election, he nearly matched Nixon's tally in the popular vote but lost the electoral vote by a wide margin. After the defeat, he returned to the Senate and served from 1971 until his death in 1978. He ran again in the 1972 Democratic primaries but lost to George McGovern and declined to be McGovern's running mate. From 1977 to 1978, he served as Deputy President pro tempore of the United States Senate.\nEarly life and education.\nHumphrey was born in a room over his father's drugstore in Wallace, South Dakota. He was the son of Ragnild Kristine Sannes (1883\u20131973), a Norwegian immigrant, and Hubert Horatio Humphrey Sr. (1882\u20131949). His paternal ancestors migrated from England to the Massachusetts Bay Colony around 1648. Humphrey spent most of his youth in Doland, South Dakota, on the Dakota prairie; the town's population was about 600. His father was a licensed pharmacist and merchant who served as mayor and a town council member. The father also served briefly in the South Dakota state legislature and was a South Dakota delegate to the 1944 and 1948 Democratic National Conventions. In the late 1920s, a severe economic downturn hit Doland; both banks in the town closed and Humphrey's father struggled to keep his store open.\nAfter his son graduated from Doland's high school, Hubert Sr. left Doland and opened a new drugstore in the larger town of Huron, South Dakota (population 11,000), where he hoped to improve his fortunes. Because of the family's financial struggles, Humphrey had to leave the University of Minnesota after just one year. He earned a pharmacist's license from the Capitol College of Pharmacy in Denver, Colorado (completing a two-year licensure program in just six months), and helped his father run his store from 1931 to 1937. Both father and son were innovative in finding ways to attract customers: \"to supplement their business, the Humphreys had become manufacturers ... of patent medicines for both hogs and humans. A sign featuring a wooden pig was hung over the drugstore to tell the public about this unusual service. Farmers got the message, and it was Humphrey's that became known as the farmer's drugstore.\" One biographer noted, \"while Hubert Jr. minded the store and stirred the concoctions in the basement, Hubert Sr. went on the road selling 'Humphrey's BTV' (Body Tone Veterinary), a mineral supplement and dewormer for hogs, and 'Humphrey's Chest Oil' and 'Humphrey's Sniffles' for two-legged sufferers.\" Humphrey later wrote, \"we made 'Humphrey's Sniffles', a substitute for Vick's Nose Drops. I felt ours were better. Vick's used mineral oil, which is not absorbent, and we used a vegetable-oil base, which was. I added benzocaine, a local anesthetic, so that even if the sniffles didn't get better, you felt it less.\" The various \"Humphrey cures ... worked well enough and constituted an important part of the family income ... the farmers that bought the medicines were good customers.\" Over time Humphrey's Drug Store became a profitable enterprise and the family again prospered. While living in Huron, Humphrey regularly attended Huron's largest Methodist church and became scoutmaster of the church's Boy Scout Troop 6. He \"started basketball games in the church basement ... although his scouts had no money for camp in 1931, Hubert found a way in the worst of that summer's dust-storm grit, grasshoppers, and depression to lead an overnight [outing].\"\nHumphrey did not enjoy working as a pharmacist, and his dream remained to earn a doctorate in political science and become a college professor. His unhappiness was manifested in \"stomach pains and fainting spells\", though doctors could find nothing wrong with him. In August 1937, he told his father that he wanted to return to the University of Minnesota. Hubert Sr. tried to convince his son not to leave by offering him a full partnership in the store, but Hubert Jr. refused and told his father \"how depressed I was, almost physically ill from the work, the dust storms, the conflict between my desire to do something and be somebody and my loyalty to him ... he replied 'Hubert, if you aren't happy, then you ought to do something about it'.\" Humphrey returned to the University of Minnesota in 1937 and earned a Bachelor of Arts in 1939. He was a member of Phi Delta Chi, a pharmacy fraternity. He also earned a master's degree from Louisiana State University in 1940, serving as an assistant instructor of political science there. One of his classmates was Russell B. Long, a future U.S. Senator from Louisiana.\nHe then became an instructor and doctoral student at the University of Minnesota from 1940 to 1941 (joining the American Federation of Teachers), and was a supervisor for the Works Progress Administration (WPA). Humphrey was a star on the university's debate team; one of his teammates was future Minnesota Governor and US Secretary of Agriculture Orville Freeman. In the 1940 presidential campaign Humphrey and future University of Minnesota president Malcolm Moos debated the merits of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Democratic nominee, and Wendell Willkie, the Republican nominee, on a Minneapolis radio station. Humphrey supported Roosevelt. Humphrey soon became active in Minneapolis politics, and as a result never finished his PhD.\nMarriage and early career.\nIn 1934, Humphrey began dating Muriel Buck, a bookkeeper and graduate of local Huron College. They were married from 1936 until Humphrey's death nearly 42 years later. They had four children: Nancy Faye, Skip Humphrey, Robert Andrew, and Douglas Sannes. Money was an issue that plagued the Humphreys consistently. One biographer noted, \"For much of his life he was short of money to live on, and his relentless drive to attain the White House seemed at times like one long, losing struggle to raise enough campaign funds to get there.\" To help boost his salary, Humphrey frequently took paid outside speaking engagements. Through most of his years as a U.S. senator and vice president, he lived in a middle-class suburban housing development in Chevy Chase, Maryland. In 1958, the Humphreys used their savings and his speaking fees to build a lakefront home in Waverly, Minnesota, about 40 miles west of Minneapolis.\nDuring World War II, Humphrey tried three times to join the armed forces but failed. His first two attempts were to join the Navy, first as a commissioned officer and then as an enlisted man. He was rejected both times for color blindness. He then tried to enlist in the Army in December 1944 but failed the physical exam because of a double hernia, color blindness, and calcification of the lungs. Despite his attempts to join the military, one biographer would note that \"all through his political life, Humphrey was dogged by the charge that he was a draft dodger\" during the war.\nHumphrey led various wartime government agencies and worked as a college instructor. In 1942, he was the state director of new production training and reemployment and chief of the Minnesota war service program. In 1943 he was the assistant director of the War Manpower Commission. From 1943 to 1944, Humphrey was a professor of political science at Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minnesota, where he headed the university's recently created international debate department, which focused on the international politics of World War II and the creation of the United Nations. After leaving Macalester in the spring of 1944, Humphrey worked as a news commentator for a Minneapolis radio station until 1945.\nIn 1943, Humphrey made his first run for elective office, for mayor of Minneapolis. He lost, but his poorly funded campaign still captured over 47% of the vote. In 1944, Humphrey was one of the key players in the merger of the Democratic and Farmer-Labor parties of Minnesota to form the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL). He also worked on President Roosevelt's 1944 reelection campaign. When Minnesota Communists tried to seize control of the new party in 1945, Humphrey became an engaged anticommunist and led the successful fight to oust the Communists from the DFL.\nMayor of Minneapolis (1945\u20131948).\nAfter the war, Humphrey again ran for mayor of Minneapolis; this time, he won the June 1945 general election with 61% of the vote. As mayor, he helped ensure the appointment of a friend and previous neighbor, Edwin Ryan, as head of the police department, as he needed a \"police chief whose integrity and loyalty would be above reproach.\" Though they had differing views of labor unions, Ryan and Humphrey worked together to crack down on crime in Minneapolis. Humphrey told Ryan, \"I want this town cleaned up and I mean I want it cleaned up now, not a year from now or a month from now, right now\", and \"You take care of the law enforcement. I'll take care of the politics.\" Humphrey served as mayor from 1945 to 1948, winning reelection in 1947 by the largest margin in the city's history to that time. Humphrey gained national fame by becoming one of the founders of the liberal anticommunist Americans for Democratic Action (ADA), and he served as chairman from 1949 to 1950. He also reformed the Minneapolis police force. The city had been named the \"anti-Semitism capital\" of the country, and its small African-American population also faced discrimination. Humphrey's mayoralty is noted for his efforts to fight all forms of bigotry. He formed the Council on Human Relations and established a municipal version of the Fair Employment Practice Committee, making Minneapolis one of only a few cities in the United States to prohibit racial discrimination in the workforce. Humphrey and his publicists were proud that the Council on Human Relations brought together individuals of varying ideologies. In 1960, Humphrey told journalist Theodore H. White, \"I was mayor once, in Minneapolis ... a mayor is a fine job, it's the best job there is between being a governor and being the President.\"\nA 1993 survey of historians, political scientists and urban experts by Melvin G. Holli of the University of Illinois at Chicago ranked Humphrey as the 28th-best American big-city mayor to have served between 1820 and 1993.\n1948 Democratic National Convention.\nThe Democratic Party of 1948 was split between those, mainly Northerners, who thought the federal government should actively protect civil rights for racial minorities, and those, mainly Southerners, who believed that states should be able to enforce racial segregation within their borders.\nAt the 1948 Democratic National Convention, the party platform reflected the division by containing only platitudes supporting civil rights. The incumbent president, Harry S. Truman, had shelved most of his 1946 Commission on Civil Rights's recommendations to avoid angering Southern Democrats. But Humphrey had written in \"The Progressive\" magazine, \"The Democratic Party must lead the fight for every principle in the report. It is all or nothing.\"\nA diverse coalition opposed the convention's tepid civil rights platform, including anticommunist liberals like Humphrey, Paul Douglas and John F. Shelley, all of whom would later become known as leading progressives in the Democratic Party. They proposed adding a \"minority plank\" to the party platform that would commit the Democratic Party to more aggressive opposition to racial segregation. The minority plank called for federal legislation against lynching, an end to legalized school segregation in the South, and ending job discrimination based on skin color. Also strongly backing the minority plank were Democratic urban bosses like Ed Flynn of the Bronx, who promised the votes of northeastern delegates to Humphrey's platform, Jacob Arvey of Chicago, and David Lawrence of Pittsburgh. Although seen as conservatives, the urban bosses believed that Northern Democrats could gain many black votes by supporting civil rights, with only comparatively small losses from Southern Democrats. Although many scholars have suggested that labor unions were leading figures in this coalition, no significant labor leaders attended the convention, except for the heads of the Congress of Industrial Organizations Political Action Committee (CIO-PAC), Jack Kroll and A.F. Whitney.\nDespite Truman's aides' aggressive pressure to avoid forcing the issue on the Convention floor, Humphrey spoke for the minority plank. In a renowned speech, Humphrey passionately told the convention, \"To those who say, my friends, to those who say that we are rushing this issue of civil rights, I say to them we are 172\u00a0years (too) late! To those who say this civil rights program is an infringement on states' rights, I say this: the time has arrived in America for the Democratic Party to get out of the shadow of states' rights and walk forthrightly into the bright sunshine of human rights!\" Humphrey and his allies succeeded: the convention adopted the pro-civil-rights plank by a vote of &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;651+1\u20442 to &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;582+1\u20442.\nAfter the convention's vote, the Mississippi delegation and half of the Alabama delegation walked out of the hall. Many Southern Democrats were so enraged at this affront to their \"way of life\" that they formed the Dixiecrat party and nominated their own presidential candidate, Governor Strom Thurmond of South Carolina. The Dixiecrats' goal was to take Southern states away from Truman and thus cause his defeat. They reasoned that after such a defeat, the national Democratic Party would never again aggressively pursue a pro-civil rights agenda. The move backfired: although the civil rights plank cost Truman the Dixiecrats' support, a significant number of black voters switched their support from Henry A. Wallace to him. As a result, Truman won an upset victory over his Republican opponent, Thomas E. Dewey. The result demonstrated that the Democratic Party could win presidential elections without the \"Solid South\" and weakened Southern Democrats. Pulitzer Prize-winning historian David McCullough has written that Humphrey probably did more to get Truman elected in 1948 than anyone other than Truman himself.\nUnited States Senate (1949\u20131964).\nHumphrey was elected to the United States Senate in 1948 on the DFL ticket, defeating James M. Shields in the DFL primary with 89% of the vote, and unseating incumbent Republican Joseph H. Ball in the general election with 60% of the vote. He took office on January 3, 1949, becoming the first Democrat elected senator from Minnesota since before the Civil War. Humphrey wrote that the victory heightened his sense of self, as he had beaten the odds of defeating a Republican with statewide support. Humphrey's father died that year, and Humphrey stopped using the \"Jr.\" suffix on his name. He was reelected in 1954 and 1960. His colleagues selected him as majority whip in 1961, a position he held until he left the Senate on December 29, 1964, to assume the vice presidency. Humphrey served from the 81st to the 87th sessions of Congress, and in a portion of the 88th Congress.\nInitially, Humphrey's support of civil rights led to his being ostracized by Southern Democrats, who dominated Senate leadership positions and wanted to punish him for proposing the civil rights platform at the 1948 Convention. Senator Richard Russell Jr. of Georgia, a leader of Southern Democrats, once remarked to other senators as Humphrey walked by, \"Can you imagine the people of Minnesota sending that damn fool down here to represent them?\" Humphrey was reportedly \"crushed\", so hurt by the remark that he broke into tears while driving home. But he refused to be intimidated and stood his ground; his integrity, passion and eloquence eventually earned him the respect of even most of the Southerners. The Southerners were also more inclined to accept Humphrey after he became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas. Humphrey became known for his advocacy of liberal causes (such as civil rights, arms control, a nuclear test ban, food stamps, and humanitarian foreign aid), and for his long and witty speeches.\nHumphrey was a liberal leader who fought to uphold Truman's veto of the McCarran Act of 1950. The bill was designed to suppress the American Communist Party. With a small group of liberals he supported the Kilgore substitute that would allow the president to lock up subversives, without trial, in a time of national emergency. The model was the internment of West Coast Japanese in 1942. The goal was to split the McCarran coalition. For years critics charged that Humphrey supported concentration camps. The ploy failed to stop the new law; the Senate voted 57 to 10 to overturn Truman's veto. In 1954 he proposed to make membership in the Communist Party a felony. It was another ploy to derail a bill that would hurt labor unions. Humphrey's proposal did not pass.\nHumphrey was the author of the first humane slaughter bill introduced in the U.S. Congress and chief Senate sponsor of the Humane Slaughter Act of 1958.\nHumphrey chaired the Select Committee on Disarmament (84th and 85th Congresses). In February 1960 he introduced a bill to establish a National Peace Agency. With another former pharmacist, Representative Carl Durham, Humphrey cosponsored the Durham-Humphrey Amendment, which amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, defining two specific categories for medications, legend (prescription) and over-the-counter (OTC).\nAs Democratic whip in the Senate in 1964, Humphrey was instrumental in the passage of the Civil Rights Act that year. He was a lead author of its text, alongside Senate Republican Minority Leader Everett Dirksen of Illinois. Humphrey's consistently cheerful and upbeat demeanor, and his forceful advocacy of liberal causes, led him to be nicknamed \"The Happy Warrior\" by many of his Senate colleagues and political journalists.\nWhile President John F. Kennedy is often credited for creating the Peace Corps, Humphrey introduced the first bill to create the Peace Corps in 1957\u2014three years before Kennedy's University of Michigan speech. A trio of journalists wrote of Humphrey in 1969 that \"few men in American politics have achieved so much of lasting significance. It was Humphrey, not Senator [Everett] Dirksen, who played the crucial part in the complex parliamentary games that were needed to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It was Humphrey, not John Kennedy, who first proposed the Peace Corps. The Food for Peace program was Humphrey's idea, and so was Medicare, passed sixteen years after he first proposed it. He worked for Federal aid to education from 1949, and for a nuclear-test ban treaty from 1956. These are the solid monuments of twenty years of effective work for liberal causes in the Senate.\" President Johnson once said that \"Most Senators are minnows ... Hubert Humphrey is among the whales.\"\nIn his autobiography, \"The Education of a Public Man\", Humphrey wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There were three bills of particular emotional importance to me: the Peace Corps, a disarmament agency, and the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. The President, knowing how I felt, asked me to introduce legislation for all three. I introduced the first Peace Corps bill in 1957. It did not meet with much enthusiasm. Some traditional diplomats quaked at the thought of thousands of young Americans scattered across their world. Many senators, including liberal ones, thought the idea was silly and unworkable. Now, with a young president urging its passage, it became possible and we pushed it rapidly through the Senate. It is fashionable now to suggest that Peace Corps Volunteers gained as much or more, from their experience as the countries they worked. That may be true, but it ought not demean their work. They touched many lives and made them better.\nOn April 9, 1950, Humphrey predicted that President Truman would sign a $4\u00a0billion housing bill and charge Republicans with having removed the bill's main middle-income benefits during Truman's tours of the Midwest and Northwest the following month.\nOn January 7, 1951, Humphrey joined Senator Paul Douglas in calling for an $80\u00a0billion federal budget to combat Communist aggression along with a stiff tax increase to prevent borrowing.\nIn a January 1951 letter to President Truman, Humphrey wrote of the necessity of a commission akin to the Fair Employment Practices Commission that would be used to end discrimination in defense industries and predicted that establishing such a commission by executive order would be met with high approval by Americans.\nOn June 18, 1953, Humphrey introduced a resolution calling for the US to urge free elections in East Germany in response to the recent anti-communist uprising there.\nIn December 1958, after receiving a message from Nikita Khrushchev during a visit to the Soviet Union, Humphrey returned insisting that the message was not negative toward America. In February 1959, Humphrey said American newspapers should have ignored Khrushchev's comments calling him a purveyor of fairy tales. In a September address to the National Stationery and Office Equipment Association, Humphrey called for further inspection of Khrushchev's \"live and let live\" doctrine and maintained the Cold War could be won by using American \"weapons of peace\".\nIn June 1963, Humphrey accompanied his longtime friend labor leader Walter Reuther on a trip to Harpsund, the Swedish Prime Minister's summer country retreat, to meet with European socialist leaders for an exchange of ideas. Among the European leaders who met with Humphrey and Reuther were the prime ministers of Britain, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, as well as future German chancellor Willy Brandt.\nPresidential and vice-presidential ambitions (1952\u20131964).\nHumphrey ran for the Democratic presidential nomination twice before his election to the vice presidency in 1964. The first time was as Minnesota's favorite son in 1952; he received only 26 votes on the first ballot. The second time was in 1960. In between these two bids, Humphrey was part of the free-for-all for the vice-presidential nomination at the 1956 Democratic National Convention, where he received 134.5 votes on the first ballot and 74.5 on the second.\nIn 1960, Humphrey ran for the nomination against fellow Senator John F. Kennedy in the primaries. Their first meeting was in the Wisconsin primary, where Kennedy's well-organized and well-funded campaign overcame Humphrey's energetic but poorly funded effort. Humphrey believed defeating Kennedy in Wisconsin would weaken and slow the momentum of the latter's campaign. Kennedy's attractive brothers, sisters, and wife Jacqueline combed the state for votes. At one point Humphrey memorably complained that he \"felt like an independent merchant competing against a chain store\". Humphrey later wrote in his memoirs that \"Muriel and I and our 'plain folks' entourage were no match for the glamour of Jackie Kennedy and the other Kennedy women, for Peter Lawford ... and Frank Sinatra singing their commercial 'High Hopes'. Jack Kennedy brought family and Hollywood to Wisconsin. The people loved it, and the press ate it up.\" Kennedy won the Wisconsin primary, but by a smaller margin than anticipated. Some commentators argued that Kennedy's victory margin had come almost entirely from areas with large Roman Catholic populations, and that Protestants had supported Humphrey. As a result, Humphrey refused to quit the race and decided to run against Kennedy again in the West Virginia primary. According to one biographer, \"Humphrey thought his chances were good in West Virginia, one of the few states that had backed him in his losing race for vice-president four years earlier ... West Virginia was more rural than urban, [which] seemed to invite Humphrey's folksy stump style. The state, moreover, was a citadel of labor. It was depressed; unemployment had hit hard; and coal miners' families were hungry. Humphrey felt he could talk to such people, who were 95% Protestant (Humphrey was a Congregationalist) and deep-dyed Bible-belters besides.\"\nKennedy chose to meet the religion issue head-on. In radio broadcasts, he carefully redefined the issue from Catholic versus Protestant to tolerance versus intolerance. Kennedy's appeal placed Humphrey, who had championed tolerance his entire career, on the defensive, and Kennedy attacked him with a vengeance. Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr., the son of the former president, stumped for Kennedy in West Virginia and raised the issue of Humphrey's failure to serve in the armed forces in World War II. Roosevelt told audiences, \"I don't know where he [Humphrey] was in World War Two,\" and handed out flyers charging that Humphrey was a draft dodger. Historian Robert Dallek has written that Robert F. Kennedy, who was serving as his brother's campaign manager, came into \"possession of information that Humphrey may have sought military deferments during World War Two ... he pressed Roosevelt to use this.\" Humphrey believed Roosevelt's draft-dodger claim \"had been approved by Bobby [Kennedy], if not Jack\". The claims that Humphrey was a draft dodger were inaccurate, because during the war Humphrey had \"tried and failed to get into the [military] service because of physical disabilities\". After the West Virginia primary, Roosevelt sent Humphrey a written apology and retraction. According to historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., Roosevelt \"felt that he had been used, blaming [the draft-dodger charge] on Robert Kennedy's determination to win at any cost ... Roosevelt said later that it was the biggest political mistake of his career.\"\nShort on funds, Humphrey could not match the well-financed Kennedy operation. He traveled around the state in a rented bus while Kennedy and his staff flew in a large, family-owned airplane. According to his biographer Carl Solberg, Humphrey spent only $23,000 on the West Virginia primary while Kennedy's campaign privately spent $1.5\u00a0million, well over their official estimate of $100,000. Unproven accusations claimed that the Kennedys had bought the West Virginia primary by bribing county sheriffs and other local officials to give Kennedy the vote. Humphrey later wrote, \"as a professional politician I was able to accept and indeed respect the efficacy of the Kennedy campaign. But underneath the beautiful exterior, there was an element of ruthlessness and toughness that I had trouble either accepting or forgetting.\" Kennedy defeated Humphrey soundly in West Virginia with 60.8% of the vote. That evening, Humphrey announced that he was leaving the race. By winning West Virginia, Kennedy overcame the belief that Protestant voters would not elect a Catholic to the presidency and thus sewed up the Democratic nomination.\nHumphrey won the South Dakota and District of Columbia primaries, which Kennedy did not enter. At the 1960 Democratic National Convention, he received 41 votes even though he was no longer a candidate.\nVice presidential campaign.\nHumphrey's defeat in 1960 had a profound influence on his thinking; after the primaries he told friends that, as a relatively poor man in politics, he was unlikely to ever become president unless he served as vice president first. Humphrey believed that only in this way could he attain the funds, nationwide organization, and visibility he would need to win the Democratic nomination. So as the 1964 presidential campaign began, Humphrey made clear his interest in becoming Lyndon Johnson's running mate. At the 1964 Democratic National Convention, Johnson kept the three likely vice-presidential candidates, Connecticut Senator Thomas Dodd, fellow Minnesota Senator Eugene McCarthy, and Humphrey, as well as the rest of the nation, in suspense before announcing his choice of Humphrey with much fanfare, praising his qualifications at considerable length before announcing his name.\nThe following day Humphrey's acceptance speech overshadowed Johnson's own acceptance address:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Hubert warmed up with a long tribute to the President, then hit his stride as he began a rhythmic jabbing and chopping at Barry Goldwater. \"Most Democrats and Republicans in the Senate voted for an $11.5\u00a0billion tax cut for American citizens and American business,\" he cried, \"but not Senator Goldwater. Most Democrats and Republicans in the Senate \u2013 in fact four-fifths of the members of his own party \u2013 voted for the Civil Rights Act, but not Senator Goldwater.\"\nTime after time, he capped his indictments with the drumbeat cry: \"But not Senator Goldwater!\" The delegates caught the cadence and took up the chant. A quizzical smile spread across Humphrey's face, then turned to a laugh of triumph. Hubert was in fine form. He knew it. The delegates knew it. And no one could deny that Hubert Humphrey would be a formidable political antagonist in the weeks ahead.\nIn an address before labor leaders in Youngstown, Ohio, on September 7, 1964, Humphrey said the labor movement had \"more at stake in this election than almost any other segment of society\". In Jamesburg, New Jersey, on September 10, Humphrey remarked that Goldwater had a \"record of retreat and reaction\" when it came to issues of urban housing. During a September 12 Denver Democratic rally, Humphrey charged Goldwater with having rejected programs that most Americans and members of his own party supported. At a Santa Fe September 13 rally, Humphrey said the Goldwater-led Republican Party was seeking \"to divide America so that they may conquer\" and that Goldwater would pinch individuals in his reduction of government. On September 16, Humphrey said the Americans for Democratic Action supported the Johnson administration's economic sanctions against Cuba, and that the organization wanted to see a free Cuban government. The following day in San Antonio, Texas, Humphrey said Goldwater opposed programs favored by most Texans and Americans. During a September 27 appearance in Cleveland, Ohio, Humphrey said the Kennedy administration had led America in a prosperous direction and called for voters to issue a referendum with their vote against \"those who seek to replace the Statue of Liberty with an iron-padlocked gate.\" At an October 1 rally in Tacoma, Washington, Humphrey attacked Goldwater as a radical who opposed the 1960 GOP platform and true conservatism, which in Humphrey's opinion meant a balance of tradition and progress.\nAt Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, California, on October 2, Humphrey said the general election would give voters a choice between his running mate and a candidate \"who curses the darkness and never lights a candle\". During an October 9 Jersey City, New Jersey, appearance, Humphrey responded to critics of the administration, who he called \"sick and tired Americans\", by touting the accomplishments of both Kennedy's and Johnson's presidencies. In Tampa, Florida, on October 18, a week after the resignation of Walter Jenkins amid a scandal, Humphrey said he was unaware of any potential security leaks relating to the case. In Minneapolis on October 24, Humphrey listed the censure vote toward Senator Joseph McCarthy, the civil rights bill, and the nuclear test ban treaty as \"three great issues of conscience to come before the United States Senate in the past decade\" that Goldwater had voted incorrectly on as a Senator. In an October 26 speech in Chicago, Humphrey called Goldwater \"neither a Republican nor a Democrat\" and \"a radical\".\nThe Johnson-Humphrey ticket won the election overwhelmingly, with 486 electoral votes out of 538. Only five Southern states and Goldwater's home state of Arizona supported the Republican ticket. In October Humphrey had predicted that the ticket would win by a large margin but not carry every state.\nVice President-elect of the United States.\nSoon after winning the election, Humphrey and Johnson went to LBJ ranch near Stonewall, Texas. On November 6, 1964, Humphrey traveled to the Virgin Islands for a two-week vacation. News stations aired taped remarks in which Humphrey stated that he had not discussed with Johnson what his role would be as vice president and that national campaigns should be reduced by four weeks. In a November 20 interview, Humphrey announced he would resign his Senate seat midway through the next month so that Walter Mondale could assume the position.\nOn December 10, 1964, Humphrey met with Johnson in the Oval Office, the latter charging the vice president-elect with \"developing a publicity machine extraordinaire and of always wanting to get his name in the paper.\" Johnson showed Humphrey a George Reed memo with the allegation that the president would die within six months from an already acquired fatal heart disease. The same day, during a speech in Washington, Johnson announced Humphrey would have the position of giving assistance to governmental civil rights programs.\nOn January 19, 1965, the day before the inauguration, Humphrey told the Democratic National Committee that the party had unified because of the national consensus established by the presidential election.\nVice presidency (1965\u20131969).\nHumphrey took office on January 20, 1965, ending the 14-month vacancy of the vice president of the United States, which had remained empty when then-Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson assumed the presidency after the assassination of John F. Kennedy in November 1963. He was an early skeptic of the then growing Vietnam War. Following a successful Viet Cong hit-and-run attack on a U.S. military installation at Pleiku on February 7, 1965 (where 7 Americans were killed and 109 wounded), Humphrey returned from Georgia to Washington D.C., to attempt to prevent further escalation. He told President Johnson that bombing North Vietnam was not a solution to the problems in South Vietnam, but that bombing would require the injection of US ground forces into South Vietnam to protect the airbases. Presciently, he noted that a military solution in Vietnam would take several years, well beyond the next election cycle. In response to this advice, President Johnson punished Humphrey by treating him coldly and restricting him from his inner circle for a number of months, until Humphrey decided to \"get back on the team\" and fully support the war effort.\nAs vice president, Humphrey was criticized for his complete and vocal loyalty to Johnson and the policies of the Johnson administration, even as many of his liberal admirers opposed the president's policies with increasing fervor regarding the Vietnam War. Many of Humphrey's liberal friends and allies abandoned him because of his refusal to publicly criticize Johnson's Vietnam War policies. Humphrey's critics later learned that Johnson had threatened Humphrey \u2013 Johnson told Humphrey that if he publicly criticized his policies, he would destroy Humphrey's chances to become president by opposing his nomination at the next Democratic Convention. However, Humphrey's critics were vocal and persistent: even his nickname, \"the Happy Warrior\", was used against him. The nickname referred not to his military hawkishness, but rather to his crusading for social welfare and civil rights programs. After his narrow defeat in the 1968 presidential election, Humphrey wrote that \"After four years as Vice-President ... I had lost some of my personal identity and personal forcefulness. ... I ought not to have let a man [Johnson] who was going to be a former President dictate my future.\"\nWhile he was vice president, Hubert Humphrey was the subject of a satirical song by songwriter/musician Tom Lehrer entitled \"Whatever Became of Hubert?\" The song addressed how some liberals and progressives felt let down by Humphrey, who had become a much more mute figure as vice president than he had been as a senator. The song goes \"\"Whatever became of Hubert? Has anyone heard a thing? Once he shone on his own, now he sits home alone and waits for the phone to ring. Once a fiery liberal spirit, ah, but now when he speaks he must clear it. ...\" \"\nDuring these years Humphrey was a repeated and favorite guest of Johnny Carson on \"The Tonight Show\". He also struck up a friendship with Frank Sinatra, who supported his campaign for president in 1968 before his conversion to the Republican party in the early 1970s, and was perhaps most on notice in the fall of 1977 when Sinatra was the star attraction and host of a tribute to a then-ailing Humphrey. He also appeared on \"The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast\" in 1973.\nOn April 15, 1965, Humphrey delivered an address to the American Society of Newspaper Editors, pledging the incumbent session of Congress would \"do more for the lasting long-term health of this nation\" since the initial session in office at the time of Franklin D. Roosevelt assuming the presidency in 1933 and predicting 13 major measures of President Johnson's administration would be passed ahead of the session's conclusion. In mid-May 1965, Humphrey traveled to Dallas, Texas for an off-the-record discussion with donors of President Johnson's campaign. During the visit, Humphrey was imposed tight security as a result of the JFK assassination a year and a half prior and the mother of Lee Harvey Oswald was placed under surveillance by Police Chief Cato Hightower.\nDuring a May 31, 1966, appearance at Huron College, Humphrey said the U.S. should not expect \"either friendship or gratitude\" in helping poorer countries. At a September 22, 1966 Jamesburg, New Jersey Democratic Party fundraiser, Humphrey said the Vietnam War would be shortened if the US stayed firm and hastened the return of troops: \"We are making a decision not only to defend Vietnam, we are defending the United States of America.\"\nDuring a May 1967 news conference, Humphrey said American anger toward Vietnam was losing traction and that he could see a growth in popularity for President Johnson since a low point five months prior. During an August 2, 1967, appearance in Detroit, Humphrey proposed each state consider forming peacekeeping councils focused on preventing violence, gaining community cooperation, and listening to \"the voices of those who have gone unheard.\"\nOn November 4, 1967, Humphrey cited Malaysia as an example of what Vietnam could resemble post a Viet Cong defeat while in Jakarta, Indonesia.\nThe following day, Vice President Humphrey requested Indonesia attempt mediation in the Vietnam War during a meeting with Suharto at Merdeka palace. On December 7, Vice President Humphrey said in an interview that the Viet Cong could potentially be the factor in creating a political compromise with the government of Saigon.\nCivil rights.\nIn February 1965, President Johnson appointed Humphrey to the chairmanship of the President's Council on Equal Opportunity. The position and board had been proposed by Humphrey, who told Johnson that the board should consist of members of the Cabinet and federal agency leaders and serve multiple roles: assisting agency cooperation, creating federal program consistency, using advanced planning to avoid potential racial unrest, creating public policy, and meeting with local and state level leaders. During his tenure, he appointed Wiley A Branton as executive director. During the first meeting of the group on March 3, Humphrey stated the budget was US$289,000 and pledged to ensure vigorous work by the small staff. Following the Watts riots in August of that year, Johnson downsized Humphrey's role as the administration's expert on civil rights. Dallek wrote the shift in role was in line with the change in policy the Johnson administration underwent in response to \"the changing political mood in the country on aid to African Americans.\" In a private meeting with Joseph Califano on September 18, 1965, President Johnson stated his intent to remove Humphrey from the post of \"point man\" on civil rights within the administration, believing the vice president was tasked with enough work. Days later, Humphrey met with Johnson, Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach, and White House Counsel Lee C. White. Johnson told Humphrey he would shorten his role within the administration's civil rights policies and pass a portion to Katzenbach, Califano writing that Humphrey agreed to go along with the plan reluctantly.\nIn an August 1967 speech at a county officials national convention in Detroit, Humphrey called for the establishment of a Marshall Plan that would curb poverty in the United States as well as address racial violence, and advocated for the creation of civil peace councils that would counter rioting. He said the councils should include representation from all minority groups and religions, state governments, the National Guard, and law enforcement agencies and that the United States would see itself out of trouble only when law and order was reestablished.\nForeign trips.\nDecember 1965 saw the beginning of Humphrey's tour of eastern countries, saying he hoped to have \"cordial and frank discussions\" ahead of the trip beginning when asked about the content of the talks. During a December 29 meeting with Prime Minister of Japan Eisaku Sat\u014d, Humphrey asked the latter for support on achieving peace in the Vietnam War and said it was a showing of strength that the United States wanted a peaceful ending rather than a display of weakness.\nHumphrey began a European tour in late-March 1967 to mend frazzled relations and indicated that he was \"ready to explain and ready to listen.\" On April 2, 1967, Vice President Humphrey met with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Harold Wilson. Ahead of the meeting, Humphrey said they would discuss multiple topics including the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, European events, Atlantic alliance strengthening, and \"the situation in the Far East\". White House Press Secretary George Christian said five days later that he had received reports from Vice President Humphrey indicating his tour of the European countries was \"very constructive\" and said President Johnson was interested in the report as well. While Humphrey was in Florence, Italy on April 1, 1967, 23-year-old Giulio Stocchi threw eggs at the Vice President and missed. He was seized by American bodyguards who turned him in to Italian officers. In Brussels, Belgium on April 9, demonstrators led by communists threw rotten eggs and fruits at Vice President Humphrey's car, also hitting several of his bodyguards. In late-December 1967, Vice President Humphrey began touring Africa.\n1968 presidential campaign.\nAs 1968 began, it looked as if President Johnson, despite the rapidly decreasing approval rating of his Vietnam War policies, would easily win the Democratic nomination for a second time. Humphrey was widely expected to remain as Johnson's running mate for reelection in 1968. Johnson was challenged by Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota, who ran on an anti-Vietnam War platform. With the backing of out-of-state anti-war college students and activists while campaigning in the New Hampshire primary, McCarthy, who was not expected to be a serious contender for the Democratic nomination, nearly defeated Johnson, finishing with a surprising 42% of the vote to Johnson's 49%. A few days after the New Hampshire primary, after months of contemplation and originally intending to support Johnson's bid for reelection, Senator Robert F. Kennedy of New York also entered the race on an anti-war platform. On March 31, a week before the Wisconsin primary, where polls showed a strong standing for McCarthy, Johnson stunned the nation by withdrawing from his race for a second full term.\nHumphrey announced his presidential candidacy on April 27. Declaring his candidacy in a speech in Washington, D.C. alongside Senators Fred Harris of Oklahoma and Walter Mondale of Minnesota (who both served as the co-chairs to his campaign), Humphrey stated:\nHere we are, just as we ought to be, here we are, the people, here we are the spirit of dedication, here we are the way politics ought to be in America, the politics of happiness, politics of purpose, politics of joy; and that's the way it's going to be, all the way, too, from here on out. We seek an America able to preserve and nurture all the basic rights of free expression, yet able to reach across the divisions that too often separate race from race, region from region, young from old, worker from scholar, rich from poor. We seek an America able to do this in the higher knowledge that our goals and ideals are worthy of conciliation and personal sacrifice.\nAlso in his speech, Humphrey supported Johnson's Vietnam initiative, which Johnson had proposed during his address to the nation four weeks earlier; partially halting the bombings in North Vietnam, while sending an additional 13,500 troops and increasing the Department of Defense's budget by 4% over the next fiscal year. Later in the campaign, Humphrey opposed a proposal by Senators McCarthy and George McGovern of South Dakota to the Democratic Convention's Policy Committee, calling for an immediate end to the bombings in Vietnam, an early withdrawal of troops and setting talks for a coalition government with the Viet Cong.\nMany people saw Humphrey as Johnson's stand-in; he won major backing from the nation's labor unions and other Democratic groups troubled by young antiwar protesters and the social unrest around the nation. A group of British journalists wrote that Humphrey, despite his liberal record on civil rights and support for a nuclear test-ban treaty, \"had turned into an arch-apologist for the war, who was given to trotting around Vietnam looking more than a little silly in olive-drab fatigues and a forage cap. The man whose name had been a by-word in the South for softness toward Negroes had taken to lecturing black groups ... the wild-eyed reformer had become the natural champion of every conservative element in the Democratic Party.\" Humphrey entered the race too late to participate in the Democratic primaries and concentrated on winning delegates in non-primary states by gaining the support of Democratic officeholders who were elected delegates to the Democratic Convention. By June, McCarthy won in Oregon and Pennsylvania, while Kennedy had won in Indiana and Nebraska, though Humphrey was the front runner as he led the delegate count. The California primary was crucial for Kennedy's campaign, as a McCarthy victory would have prevented Kennedy from reaching the number of delegates required to secure the nomination. On June 4, Kennedy defeated McCarthy by less than 4% in the winner-take-all California primary. But the nation was shocked yet again when Senator Kennedy was assassinated after his victory speech at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. After the assassination of Kennedy, Humphrey suspended his campaign for two weeks.\nChicago riots and party fallout.\nHumphrey did not enter any of the 13 state primary elections, but won the Democratic nomination at the party convention in Chicago, even though 80 percent of the primary voters had been for antiwar candidates. The delegates defeated the peace plank by &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1,567+3\u20444 to &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1,041+1\u20444. Humphrey selected as his running mate U.S. Senator Ed Muskie of Maine. Unfortunately for Humphrey and his campaign, in Grant Park, just five miles south of International Amphitheatre convention hall, and at other sites near downtown Chicago, there were gatherings and protests by thousands of antiwar demonstrators, many of whom favored McCarthy, George McGovern, or other antiwar candidates. Mayor Richard J. Daley's Chicago police attacked and beat these protesters, most of them young college students, which amplified the growing feelings of unrest among the public.\nHumphrey's inaction during these incidents, Johnson's and Daley's behind-the-scenes maneuvers, public backlash against Humphrey's winning the nomination without entering a single primary, and Humphrey's refusal to meet McCarthy halfway on his demands, resulting in McCarthy's refusal to fully endorse him, highlighted turmoil in the Democratic Party's base that proved to be too much for Humphrey to overcome in time for the general election. The combination of Johnson's unpopularity, the Chicago demonstrations, and the discouragement of liberals and African-Americans after the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. that year, all contributed to his loss to former Vice President Nixon. Nevertheless, as American Independent Party candidate George Wallace lost support among white union members, Humphrey regained strength and the final polls showed a close race. Humphrey reversed his Vietnam policy, called for peace talks, and won back some of the antiwar Democrats.\nNixon won the electoral college and the election. Humphrey lost the popular vote by less than one percent, with 43.4% for Nixon (31,783,783 votes) to 42.7% (31,271,839) for Humphrey, and 13.5% (9,901,118) for George Wallace. Humphrey carried just 13 states and the District of Columbia with 191 electoral college votes, Nixon carried 32 states and 301 electoral votes, and Wallace carried five states and 46 electoral votes. In his concession speech, Humphrey said, \"I have done my best. I have lost; Mr. Nixon has won. The democratic process has worked its will.\"\nPost-vice presidency (1969\u20131978).\nTeaching and return to the Senate.\nAfter leaving the vice presidency, Humphrey taught at Macalester College and the University of Minnesota, and served as chairman of the board of consultants at the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Educational Corporation.\nOn February 11, 1969, Humphrey met privately with Mayor Richard J. Daley and denied ever being \"at war\" with Daley during a press conference later in the day. In March, Humphrey declined to answer questions on the Johnson administration being either involved or privy to the cessation of bombing of North Vietnam during an interview on \"Issues and Answers\". At a press conference on June 2, 1969, Humphrey backed Nixon's peace efforts, dismissing the notion that he was not seeking an end to the war. In early July, Humphrey traveled to Finland for a private visit. Later that month, Humphrey returned to Washington after visiting Europe, a week after McCarthy declared he would not seek reelection, Humphrey declining to comment amid speculation he intended to return to the Senate. During the fall, Humphrey arranged to meet with President Nixon through United States National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger, Humphrey saying the day after the meeting that Nixon had \"expressed his appreciation on my attitude to his effort on Vietnam.\" On August 3, Humphrey said that Russia was buying time to develop ballistic missile warheads to catch up with the United States and that security was the \"overriding concern\" of the Soviet Union. Days later, Humphrey repudiated efforts against Nixon's anti-ballistic missile system: \"I have a feeling that they [opponents of the ABM] were off chasing rabbits when a tiger is loose.\" During October, Humphrey spoke before the AFL-CIO convention delegates, charging Nixon's economic policies with \"putting Americans out of work without slowing inflation.\" On October 10, Humphrey stated his support for Nixon's policies in Vietnam and that he believed \"the worst thing that we can do is to try to undermine the efforts of the President.\" At a December 21 press conference, Humphrey said Nixon was a participant in the \"politics of polarization\" and could not seek unity on one hand but have divisive agents on the other. On December 26, Humphrey responded to a claim from former President Johnson that Humphrey had been cost the election by his own call for a stop to the bombing in North Vietnam, saying he did what he \"thought was right and responsible at Salt Lake City.\"\nOn January 4, 1970, Humphrey said the United States should cease tests of nuclear weapons during the continued conversations for potential strategic arms limitations between the United States and the Soviet Union while speaking to the National Retail Furniture Association. In February, Humphrey predicted Nixon would withdraw 75,000 or more troops prior to the year's midterm elections and the main issue would be the economy during an interview: \"The issue of 1970 is the economy. Some of my fellow Democrats don't believe this. But this is a fact.\" On February 23, Humphrey disclosed his recommendation that Larry O'Brien return as Chair of the Democratic National Committee, a Humphrey spokesman reporting that he wanted the issue of the DNC chairmanship settled quickly. Solberg wrote that Nixon's April 1970 Cambodian Campaign quashed Humphrey's hopes that the war be taken out of political context. In May, Humphrey pledged to do all he could to provide additional war planes to Israel and stress the issue to American leaders. Amid an August 11 address to an American Bar Association luncheon meeting, Humphrey called for liberals to cease defending campus radicals and militants and align with law and order.\nHumphrey had not planned to return to political life, but an unexpected opportunity changed his mind. McCarthy, who was up for reelection in 1970, realized that he had only a slim chance of winning even re-nomination for the Minnesota seat because he had angered his party by opposing Johnson and Humphrey for the 1968 presidential nomination, and declined to run. Humphrey won the nomination, defeated Republican Congressman Clark MacGregor, and returned to the U.S. Senate on January 3, 1971. Ahead of resuming his duties, Humphrey had a November 16, 1970, White House meeting with Nixon as part of a group of newly elected senators. He was reelected in 1976, and remained in office until his death. In a rarity in politics, Humphrey held both Senate seats from his state (Class I and Class II) at different times. During his return to the Senate he served in the 92nd, 93rd, 94th, and a portion of the 95th Congress. He served as chairman of the Joint Economic Committee in the 94th Congress.\nFourth Senate term.\nL. Edward Purcell wrote that upon returning to the Senate, Humphrey found himself \"again a lowly junior senator with no seniority\" and that he resolved to create credibility in the eyes of liberals. On May 3, 1971, after the Americans for Democratic Action adopted a resolution demanding Nixon's impeachment, Humphrey said they were acting \"more out of emotion and passion than reason and prudent judgment\" and that the request was irresponsible. On May 21, Humphrey said ending hunger and malnutrition in the U.S. was \"a moral obligation\" during a speech to International Food Service Manufacturers Association members. In June, Humphrey delivered the commencement address at the University of Bridgeport and days later said that he believed Nixon was interested in seeing a peaceful end to the Vietnam War \"as badly as any senator or anybody else.\" On July 14, testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Arms Control, Humphrey proposed amending the defense procurement bill to place in escrow all funds for creation and usage of multiple\u2010missile warheads in the midst of continued arms limitations talks. Humphrey said members of the Nixon administration needed to remember \"when they talk of a tough negotiating position, they are going to get a tough response.\" On September 6, Humphrey rebuked the Nixon administration's wage price freeze, saying it was based on trickle-down policies and advocating \"percolate up\" as a replacement, while speaking at a United Rubber Workers gathering. On October 26, Humphrey stated his support for removing barriers to voting registration and authorizing students to establish voting residences in their college communities, rebuking the refusal of United States Attorney General John N. Mitchell the previous month to take a role in shaping voter registration laws as applicable to new voters. On December 24, 1971, Humphrey accused the Nixon administration of turning its back on the impoverished in the rural U.S., citing few implementations of the relief recommendations of the 1967 National Advisory Commission; in another statement he said only three of the 150 recommendations had been implemented. On December 27, responding to antiwar protesters in Philadelphia, Humphrey said the Nixon administration was responsible for an escalation of the Southeast Asia war and requested complete cessation of North Vietnam bombing.\nIn January 1972, Humphrey said the U.S. would have been out of Vietnam by that point had he been elected president, saying Nixon was taking longer to withdraw American troops from the country than it took to defeat Adolf Hitler. On May 20, Humphrey said Nixon's proposal to limit schoolchildren busing was \"insufficient in the amount of aid needed for our children, deceptive to the American people, and insensitive to the laws and the Constitution of this nation\", in a reversal of his prior stance, while in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. During a May 30 appearance in Burbank, California, Humphrey stated his support for an immediate withdrawal of American forces from South Vietnam despite an invasion by North Vietnam.\nIn January 1973, Humphrey said the Nixon administration was plotting to eliminate a school milk program in the upcoming fiscal year budget during a telephone interview. On February 18, 1973, Humphrey said the Middle East could possibly usher in peace following the Vietnam War ending along with American troops withdrawing from Indochina during an appearance at the New York Hilton. In August 1973, Humphrey called on Nixon to schedule a meeting with nations exporting and importing foods as part of an effort to both create a worldwide policy on food and do away with food hoarding. After Nixon's dismissal of Archibald Cox, Humphrey said he found \"the whole situation entirely depressing.\" Three days after Cox's dismissal, during a speech to the AFL-CIO convention on October 23, Humphrey declined to say whether he believed Nixon should be impeached, saying that his congressional position would likely cause him to play a role in determining Nixon's fate. On December 21, Humphrey disclosed his request of federal tax deductions of $199,153 for the donation of his vice-presidential papers to the Minnesota State Historical Society.\nIn early January 1974, Humphrey checked into the Bethesda Naval Hospital for tests regarding a minute tumor of the bladder. His physician Edgar Berman said the next day that Humphrey \"looks fine and feels fine\" and was expected to leave early the following week. In an interview conducted on March 29, 1974, Humphrey concurred with Senator Mike Mansfield's assessment from the prior day that the House of Representatives had enough votes to impeach Nixon. Humphrey was reportedly pleased by Nixon's resignation.\nIn an April 1975 news conference at the spring education conference of the United Federation of Teachers, Humphrey cited the need for a national department of education, a national education trust fund, and a federal government provision for a third of America's educational expenses. He said the Ford administration had no educational policy and noted the United States was the only industrialized country without a separate national education department. In May, Humphrey testified at the trial of his former campaign manager Jack L. Chestnut, admitting that as a candidate he sought the support of Associated Milk Producers, Inc., but saying he was not privy to the illegal contributions Chestnut was accused of taking from the organization. Later that month, Humphrey was one of 19 senators to originate a letter stating the expectation of 75 senators that Ford would submit a foreign aid request to Congress meeting the \"urgent military and economic needs\" of Israel. In August, after the United States Court of Appeals ruled that Ford had no authority to continue levying fees of $2 a barrel on imported oil, Humphrey hailed the decision as \"the best news we've heard on the inflation front in a long time\" and urged Ford to accept the decision because the price reduction on oil and oil\u2010related products would benefit the national economy. In October, after Sara Jane Moore attempted to assassinate Ford, Humphrey joined former presidential candidates Barry Goldwater, Edmund Muskie, and George McGovern in urging Ford and other presidential candidates to restrain their campaigning the following year to prevent future attempts on their lives.\nIn October 1976, Humphrey was admitted to a hospital for the removal of a cancerous bladder, predicted his victory in his reelection bid, and advocated for members of his party to launch efforts to increase voter turnout upon his release.\n1972 presidential campaign.\nOn November 4, 1970, shortly after being reelected to the Senate, Humphrey stated his intention to take on the role of a \"harmonizer\" within the Democratic Party to minimize the possibility of potential presidential candidates within the party lambasting each other prior to deciding to run in the then-upcoming election, dismissing that he was an active candidate at that time. In December 1971, Humphrey made his second trip to New Jersey in under a month, talking with a plurality of county leaders at the Robert Treat Hotel: \"I told them I wanted their support. I said I'd rather work with them than against them.\"\nIn 1972, Humphrey once again ran for the Democratic nomination for president, announcing his candidacy on January 10, 1972, during a twenty-minute speech in Philadelphia. At the time of the announcement, Humphrey said he was running on a platform of the removal of troops from Vietnam and a revitalization of the United States economy. He drew upon continuing support from organized labor and the African-American and Jewish communities, but remained unpopular with college students because of his association with the Vietnam War, even though he had altered his position in the years since his 1968 defeat. Humphrey initially planned to skip the primaries, as he had in 1968. Even after he revised this strategy he still stayed out of New Hampshire, a decision that allowed McGovern to emerge as the leading challenger to Muskie in that state. Humphrey did win some primaries, including those in Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania, but was defeated by McGovern in several others, including the crucial California primary. Humphrey also was out-organized by McGovern in caucus states and was trailing in delegates at the 1972 Democratic National Convention in Miami Beach, Florida. His hopes rested on challenges to the credentials of some of the McGovern delegates. For example, the Humphrey forces argued that the winner-take-all rule for the California primary violated procedural reforms intended to produce a better reflection of the popular vote, the reason that the Illinois delegation was bounced. The effort failed, as several votes on delegate credentials went McGovern's way, guaranteeing his victory. After his primary win, McGovern asked Humphrey to be his running mate, but Humphrey declined. After the election, Humphrey called Nixon and the two had an amicable conversation in which Humphrey implied that he preferred Nixon to McGovern, and had tried to keep McGovern from winning.\n1976 presidential election activities.\nOn April 22, 1974, Humphrey said that he would not enter the upcoming Democratic presidential primary for the 1976 presidential election. Humphrey said at the time that he was urging fellow Senator and Minnesotan Walter Mondale to run, despite believing that Ted Kennedy would enter the race as well. Leading up to the election cycle, Humphrey also said, \"Here's a time in my life when I appear to have more support than at any other time in my life. But it's too financially, politically, and physically debilitating \u2013 and I'm just not going to do it.\" In December 1975, a Gallup poll was released showing Humphrey and Ronald Reagan as the leading Democratic and Republican candidates for the following year's presidential election.\nOn April 12, 1976, Chairman of the New Jersey Democratic Party State Senator James P. Dugan said the selection of a majority of uncommitted delegates could be interpreted as a victory for Humphrey, who had indicated his availability as a presidential candidate for the convention. Humphrey announced his choice to not enter the New Jersey primary nor authorize any committees to work to support him during an April 29, 1976, appearance in the Senate Caucus Room. Even after Jimmy Carter had won enough delegates to clinch the nomination, many still wanted Humphrey to announce his availability for a draft. However, he did not do so, and Carter easily secured the nomination on the first round of balloting. Humphrey had learned that he had terminal cancer, prompting him to sit the race out.\nHumphrey attended the November 17, 1976, meeting between President-elect Carter and Democratic congressional leaders in which Carter sought out support for a proposal to have the president's power to reorganize the government reinstated with potential to be vetoed by Congress.\nFifth Senate term.\nHumphrey attended the May 3, 1977, White House meeting on legislative priorities. Humphrey told President Carter that the U.S. would enter a period of high unemployment without an economic stimulus and noted that in \"every period in our history, a rise in unemployment has been accompanied by a rise in inflation\". Humphrey stated a preventative health care program would be the only way for the Carter administration to not have to fund soaring health costs. In July 1977, after the Senate began debating approval for funding of the neutron bomb, Humphrey stated that the White House had agreed to release the impact statement, a requirement for congressional funding of a new weapon.\nDeputy President pro tempore of the Senate (1977\u20131978).\nIn 1974, along with Rep. Augustus Hawkins of California, Humphrey authored the Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act, the first attempt at full employment legislation. The original bill proposed to guarantee full employment to all citizens over 16 and set up a permanent system of public jobs to meet that goal. A watered-down version called the \"Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act\" passed the House and Senate in 1978. It set the goal of 4 percent unemployment and 3 percent inflation and instructed the Federal Reserve Board to try to produce those goals when making policy decisions.\nHumphrey ran for Majority Leader after the 1976 election but lost to Robert Byrd of West Virginia. The Senate honored Humphrey by creating the post of Deputy President pro tempore of the Senate for him. On August 16, 1977, Humphrey revealed he was suffering from terminal bladder cancer. On October 25 of that year, he addressed the Senate, and on November 3, Humphrey became the first person other than a member of the House or the President of the United States to address the House of Representatives in session. President Carter honored him by giving him command of Air Force One for his final trip to Washington on October 23. One of Humphrey's final speeches contained the lines \"It was once said that the moral test of Government is how that Government treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are in the shadows of life, the sick, the needy and the handicapped\", which is sometimes described as the \"liberals' mantra\".\nDeath and funeral.\nHumphrey spent his last weeks calling old political acquaintances. One call was to Richard Nixon, inviting him to his upcoming funeral, which Nixon accepted. Staying in the hospital, Humphrey went from room to room, cheering up other patients by telling them jokes and listening to them. On January 13, 1978, he died of bladder cancer at his home in Waverly, Minnesota, at the age of 66.\nHumphrey's body lay in state in the rotundas of the U.S. Capitol and the Minnesota State Capitol before being interred at Lakewood Cemetery in Minneapolis. His death overshadowed the death of his colleague from Montana, Senator Lee Metcalf, who had died the day before Humphrey. Old friends and opponents of Humphrey, from Gerald Ford and Richard Nixon to President Carter and Vice President Walter Mondale, paid their final respects. \"He taught us how to live, and finally he taught us how to die\", said Mondale.\nHumphrey's wife Muriel was appointed by Minnesota governor Rudy Perpich to serve in the U.S. Senate until a special election to fill the term was held; she did not seek election to finish her husband's term in office. In 1981, she married Max Brown and took the name Muriel Humphrey Brown. Upon her death in 1998 she was interred next to Humphrey at Lakewood Cemetery.\nThe epitaph on Humphrey's gravestone reads: \"I have enjoyed my life, its disappointments outweighed by its pleasures. I have loved my country in a way that some people consider sentimental and out of style. I still do, and I remain an optimist, with joy, without apology, about this country and about the American experiment in democracy.\"\nHonors and legacy.\nIn 1965, Humphrey was made an \"Honorary Life Member\" of Alpha Phi Alpha, a historically African American fraternity.\nIn 1978, Humphrey received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.\nHe was awarded posthumously the Congressional Gold Medal on June 13, 1979, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1980.\nHe was honored by the United States Postal Service with a 52\u00a2 Great Americans series (1980\u20132000) postage stamp.\nThere is a statue of him in front of the Minneapolis City Hall.\nHumphrey's legacy is bolstered by his early leadership in civil rights, and undermined by his long support of the Vietnam War. His leading biographer Arnold A. Offner says he was \"the most successful legislator in the nation's history and a powerful voice for equal justice for all.\" Offner writes that Humphrey was:\nA major force for nearly every important liberal policy initiative...putting civil rights on his party's and the nation's agenda [in 1948] for decades to come. As senator he proposed legislation to effect national health insurance, for aid to poor nations, immigration and income tax reform, a Job Corps, the Peace Corps, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, and the path breaking 1963 Limited Test Ban Treaty...[He provided] masterful stewardship of the historic 1964 Civil Rights Act through the Senate.\nWhile acknowledging his accomplishments, some historians emphasize that Humphrey was \"a flawed, and not entirely likeable, figure who talked too much and neglected his family while pursuing a politics of compromise that owed as much to his vaunting personal ambition as to political pragmatism.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "42640", "revid": "50539926", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42640", "title": "Sandra Day O'Connor", "text": "American lawyer, politician and judge (1930\u20132023)\nSandra Day O'Connor (March 26, 1930 \u2013 December 1, 2023) was an American attorney, politician, and jurist who served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1981 to 2006. Nominated by President Ronald Reagan, O'Connor was the first woman to serve as a U.S. Supreme Court justice. A moderate conservative, she was considered a swing vote. Before O'Connor's tenure on the Court, she was an Arizona state judge and earlier an elected legislator in Arizona, serving as the first female majority leader of a state senate as the Republican leader in the Arizona Senate. Upon her nomination to the Court, O'Connor was confirmed unanimously by the United States Senate.\nO'Connor usually sided with the Court's conservative bloc but on occasion sided with the Court's liberal members. She often wrote concurring opinions that sought to limit the reach of the majority holding. Her majority opinions in landmark cases include \"Grutter v. Bollinger\" and \"Hamdi v. Rumsfeld\". In 2000, she wrote in part the \"per curiam\" majority opinion in \"Bush v. Gore\" and in 1992 was one of three co-authors of the lead opinion in \"Planned Parenthood v. Casey\" that preserved legal access to abortion in the United States. On July 1, 2005, O'Connor announced her retirement, effective upon the confirmation of a successor. At the time of her death, O'Connor was the last living member of the Burger Court. Samuel Alito was nominated to take her seat in October 2005, and joined the Supreme Court on January 31, 2006.\nDuring her term on the Court, O'Connor was regarded as among the most powerful women in the world. After retiring, she succeeded Henry Kissinger as the chancellor of the College of William &amp; Mary. In 2009, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.\nEarly life and education.\nSandra Day was born on March 26, 1930, in El Paso, Texas, the daughter of Harry Alfred Day, a rancher, and Ada Mae (Wilkey). She grew up on a 198,000-acre family cattle ranch near Duncan, Arizona and in El Paso, where she attended school. Her home was nine miles from the nearest paved road. It lacked running water or electricity until Sandra was seven years old. As a cowgirl she owned a .22-caliber rifle and would shoot coyotes and jackrabbits. She began driving as soon as she could see over the dashboard and had to learn to change flat tires herself. Sandra had two younger siblings, a sister and a brother, respectively eight and ten years her junior. Her sister Ann Day was a member of the Arizona Legislature from 1990 to 2000. Her brother was H. Alan Day, a lifelong rancher, with whom she wrote \"Lazy B: Growing up on a Cattle Ranch in the American Southwest\" (2002), about their childhood experiences on the ranch. For most of her early schooling, Day lived in El Paso with her maternal grandmother. She went to the Radford School for Girls, a private school, because the family ranch was far from schools. Day was able to return to the ranch for holidays and the summer. Day did spend her eighth-grade year living at the ranch and riding a bus 32 miles to school. She graduated sixth in her class at Austin High School in El Paso in 1946.\nAccepted into Stanford University at age 16, O'Connor earned a B.A. in economics in 1950, graduating \"magna cum laude\". Inspired by Professor Harry Rathbun, she pursued a law degree at Stanford Law School, graduating near the top of her class in 1952. While attending, she served on the \"Stanford Law Review\" whose then presiding editor-in-chief was future Supreme Court chief justice William Rehnquist. Day achieved the Order of the Coif, indicating she was in the top 10 percent of her class.\nEarly career and marriage.\nWhile in her final year at Stanford Law School, Day began dating John Jay O'Connor III, who was one class year behind her. On December 20, 1952, six months after her graduation, O'Connor and Day married at her family's ranch.\nUpon graduation from law school in 1952, O'Connor had difficulty finding a paying job as an attorney in a law firm because of her gender. O'Connor found employment as a deputy county attorney in San Mateo, California, after she offered to work for no salary and without an office, sharing space with a secretary. After a few months, she began drawing a small salary as she performed legal research and wrote memos. She worked with San Mateo County District Attorney Louis Dematteis and deputy district attorney Keith Sorensen.\nWhen her husband was drafted, O'Connor decided to go with him to work in Germany as a civilian attorney for the Army's Quartermaster Corps. They remained there for three years before returning to the States where they settled in Maricopa County, Arizona, and she started a law firm. They had three sons: Scott (born 1958), Brian (born 1960), and Jay (born 1962). Following Brian's birth, O'Connor took a five-year hiatus from the practice of law.\nShe volunteered in various political organizations, such as the Maricopa County Young Republicans, and served on Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater's presidential campaign in 1964.\nO'Connor served as assistant Attorney General of Arizona from 1965 to 1969. In 1969, the governor of Arizona appointed O'Connor to fill a vacancy in the Arizona Senate. She ran for and won the election for the seat the following year. By 1973, she became the first woman to serve as Arizona's or any state's majority leader. She developed a reputation as a skilled negotiator and a moderate. After serving two full terms, O'Connor decided to leave the Senate.\nIn 1974, O'Connor was appointed to the Maricopa County Superior Court, serving from 1975 to 1979 when she was elevated to the Arizona Court of Appeals.\nIn late 1977 and early 1978, she presided over an aggravated assault case against Clarence Dixon, a 22-year-old Arizona State University student who had attacked a 15-year-old girl with a metal pipe. O'Connor would find Dixon not guilty by reason of insanity and have him remanded to a state hospital. In the four-day period between O'Connor's ruling and Dixon's remanding to hospital, Dixon would rape and murder one of his seniors, 21-year-old Deana Lynne Bowdoin; he would not be arrested until 2001 when DNA evidence identified him, and he was executed for Bowdoin's murder in 2022.\nShe served on the Court of Appeals-Division One until 1981 when she was appointed to the Supreme Court by President Ronald Reagan.\nSupreme Court career.\nNomination and confirmation.\nOn July 7, 1981, Reagan\u00a0\u2013 who had pledged during his 1980 presidential campaign to appoint the first woman to the Court\u00a0\u2013 announced he would nominate O'Connor as an associate justice of the Supreme Court to replace the retiring Potter Stewart. O'Connor received notification from President Reagan of her nomination on the day prior to the announcement and did not know that she was a finalist for the position.\nReagan wrote in his diary on July 6, 1981: \"Called Judge O'Connor and told her she was my nominee for supreme court. Already the flak is starting and from my own supporters. Right to Life people say she is pro abortion. She declares abortion is personally repugnant to her. I think she'll make a good justice.\" O'Connor told Reagan she did not remember whether she had supported repealing Arizona's law banning abortion. However, she had cast a preliminary vote in the Arizona State Senate in 1970 in favor of a bill to repeal the state's criminal-abortion statute. In 1974, O'Connor had opined against a measure to prohibit abortions in some Arizona hospitals. Anti-abortion and religious groups opposed O'Connor's nomination because they suspected, correctly, she would not be willing to overturn \"Roe v. Wade.\" U.S. Senate Republicans, including Don Nickles of Oklahoma, Steve Symms of Idaho, and Jesse Helms of North Carolina called the White House to express their discontent over the nomination; Nickles said he and \"other profamily Republican senators would not support O'Connor\". Helms, Nickles, and Symms nevertheless reluctantly voted for confirmation.\nReagan formally nominated O'Connor on August 19, 1981. Conservative activists such as the Reverend Jerry Falwell, Howard Phillips, and Peter Gemma also spoke out against the nomination. Gemma called the nomination \"a direct contradiction of the Republican platform to everything that candidate Reagan said and even President Reagan has said in regard to social issues.\" Gemma, the executive director of the National Pro-Life Political Action Committee, had sought to delay O'Connor's confirmation by challenging her record, including support for the Equal Rights Amendment.\nO'Connor's confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee began on September 9, 1981. It was the first televised confirmation hearing for a Supreme Court justice. The confirmation hearing lasted three days and largely focused on the issue of abortion. When asked, O'Connor refused to telegraph her views on abortion, and she was careful not to leave the impression that she supported abortion rights. The Judiciary Committee approved O'Connor with seventeen votes in favor and one vote of present.\nOn September 21, O'Connor was confirmed by the U.S. Senate with a vote of 99\u20130. Only Senator Max Baucus of Montana was absent from the vote. He sent O'Connor a copy of \"A River Runs Through It\" by way of apology. In her first year on the Court, she received over 60,000 letters from the public, more than any other justice in history.\nTenure.\nO'Connor said she felt a responsibility to demonstrate women could do the job of justice. She faced some practical concerns, including the lack of a women's restroom near the Courtroom.\nTwo years after O'Connor joined the Court, \"The New York Times\" published an editorial that mentioned the \"nine men\" of the \"SCOTUS\", or Supreme Court of the United States. O'Connor responded with a letter to the editor reminding the \"Times\" that the Court was no longer composed of nine men and referred to herself as FWOTSC (First Woman on the Supreme Court).\nO'Connor was a proponent of collegiality among justices on the court, often insisting that the justices eat lunch together.\nIn 1993, Ruth Bader Ginsburg became the second female Supreme Court justice. O'Connor said that she felt relief from the media clamor when she no longer was the only woman on the Court. In May 2010, O'Connor warned female Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan about the \"unpleasant\" process of confirmation hearings.\nSupreme Court jurisprudence.\nInitially, O'Connor's voting record aligned closely with the conservative William Rehnquist (voting with him 87% of the time during her first three years at the Court). From that time until 1998, O'Connor's alignment with Rehnquist ranged from 93.4% to 63.2%, hitting above 90% in three of those years. In nine of her first 16 years on the Court, O'Connor voted with Rehnquist more than with any other justice.\nLater on, as the Court's make-up became more conservative (e.g., Anthony Kennedy replacing Lewis Powell, and Clarence Thomas replacing Thurgood Marshall), O'Connor often became the swing vote on the Court. However, she usually disappointed the Court's more liberal bloc in contentious 5\u20134 decisions: from 1994 to 2004, she joined the traditional conservative bloc of Rehnquist, Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, and Thomas 82 times; she joined the liberal bloc of John Paul Stevens, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer only 28 times.\nO'Connor's relatively small shift away from conservatives on the Court seems to have been due at least in part to Thomas' views. When Thomas and O'Connor were voting on the same side, she would typically write a separate opinion of her own, refusing to join his. In the 1992 term, O'Connor did not join a single one of Thomas's dissents.\nSome notable cases in which O'Connor joined the majority in a 5\u20134 decision were:\nO'Connor played an important role in other notable cases, such as:\nOn February 22, 2005, with Rehnquist and Stevens (who were senior to her) absent, she became the senior justice presiding over oral arguments in the case of \"Kelo v. City of New London\", becoming the first woman to do so before the Court.\nFirst Amendment.\nO'Connor was unpredictable in many of her court decisions, especially those regarding First Amendment Establishment Clause issues. Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said, \"O'Connor was a conservative, but she saw the complexity of church-state issues and tried to choose a course that respected the country's religious diversity\" (Hudson 2005). O'Connor voted in favor of religious institutions, such as in \"Rosenberger v. University of Virginia\" (1995), \"Mitchell v. Helms\" (2000), and \"Zelman v. Simmons-Harris\" (2002). Conversely, in \"Lee v. Weisman\" she was part of the majority in the case that saw religious prayer and pressure to stand in silence at a graduation ceremony as part of a religious act that coerced people to support or participate in religion, which the Establishment Clause strictly prohibits. This is consistent with a similar case, \"Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe\", involving prayer at a school football game. In this case, O'Connor joined the majority opinion that stated prayer at school football games violates the Establishment Clause. O'Connor was the first justice to articulate the \"no endorsement\" standard for the Establishment Clause. In \"Lynch v. Donnelly\", O'Connor signed onto a five-justice majority opinion holding that a nativity scene in a public Christmas display did not violate the First Amendment. She penned a concurrence in that case, opining that the cr\u00e8che did not violate the Establishment Clause because it did not express an endorsement or disapproval of any religion. In \"Board of County Commissioners, Wabaunsee County, Kansas v Umbehr\" (1996) she upheld the application of first amendment free speech rights to independent contractors working for public bodies, being unpersuaded \"that there is a 'difference of constitutional magnitude' ... between independent contractors and employees\" in circumstances where a contractor has been critical of a governing body.\nFourth Amendment.\nAccording to law professor Jeffrey Rosen, \"O'Connor was an eloquent opponent of intrusive group searches that threatened privacy without increasing security. In a 1983 opinion upholding searches by drug-sniffing dogs, she recognized that a search is most likely to be considered constitutionally reasonable if it is very effective at discovering contraband without revealing \"innocent but embarrassing\" information.\" Washington College of Law professor Andrew Taslitz, referencing O'Connor's dissent in a 2001 case, said of her Fourth Amendment jurisprudence: \"O'Connor recognizes that needless humiliation of an individual is an important factor in determining Fourth Amendment reasonableness.\" O'Connor once quoted the social contract theory of John Locke as influencing her views on the reasonableness and constitutionality of government action.\nCases involving race.\nIn \"McCleskey v. Kemp\" (1987), O'Connor joined a 5\u20134 majority that voted to uphold the death penalty for an African American man, Warren McCleskey, convicted of killing a white police officer, despite statistical evidence that Black defendants were more likely to receive the death penalty than others both in Georgia and in the U.S. as a whole.\nIn the 1990 and 1995 \"Missouri v. Jenkins\" rulings, O'Connor voted with the majority that Federal district courts had no authority to require the state of Missouri to increase school funding to counteract racial inequality. In the 1991 case \"Freeman v. Pitts\", O'Connor joined a concurring opinion in a plurality, agreeing that a school district that had formerly been under judicial review for racial segregation could be freed of this review, even though not all desegregation targets had been met. Law professor Herman Schwartz criticized these rulings, writing that in both cases \"both the fact and effects of segregation were still present\".\nIn 1996's \"Shaw v. Hunt\" and \"Shaw v. Reno\", O'Connor joined a Rehnquist opinion, following an earlier precedent from an opinion she authored in 1993, in which the Court struck down an electoral districting plan designed to facilitate the election of two Black representatives out of 12 from North Carolina, a state that had not had any Black representative since Reconstruction, despite being approximately 20% Black\u00a0\u2013 the Court held that the districts were unacceptably gerrymandered and O'Connor called the odd shape of the district in question, North Carolina's 12th, \"bizarre\".\nLaw professor Herman Schwartz called O'Connor \"the Court's leader in its assault on racially oriented affirmative action\", although she joined with the Court in upholding the constitutionality of limited race-based admissions to universities.\nIn 2003, O'Connor authored a majority Supreme Court opinion (\"Grutter v. Bollinger\") saying racial affirmative action should not be constitutional permanently, but long enough to correct past discrimination\u00a0\u2013 with an approximate limit of around 25 years.\nAbortion.\nThe Christian right element in the Reagan coalition strongly supported him in 1980, in the belief that he would appoint Supreme Court justices to overturn \"Roe v. Wade\". They were astonished and dismayed when his first appointment was O'Connor, who they feared would tolerate abortion. They worked hard to defeat her confirmation but failed. In her confirmation hearings and early days on the Court, O'Connor was carefully ambiguous on the issue of abortion, as some conservatives questioned her anti-abortion credentials based on some of her votes in the Arizona legislature. O'Connor generally dissented from 1980s opinions which took an expansive view of \"Roe v. Wade\"; she criticized that decision's \"trimester approach\" sharply in her dissent in \"City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health\" (1983). She criticized \"Roe\" in \"Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\" (1986): \"I dispute not only the wisdom but also the legitimacy of the Court's attempt to discredit and pre-empt state abortion regulation regardless of the interests it serves and the impact it has.\" In 1989, O'Connor stated during the deliberations over the \"Webster\" case that she would not overrule \"Roe\". While on the Court, O'Connor did not vote to strike down any restrictions on abortion until \"Hodgson v. Minnesota\" in 1990.\nO'Connor allowed certain limits to be placed on access to abortion, but supported the right to abortion established by \"Roe\". In the landmark ruling \"Planned Parenthood v. Casey\" (1992), O'Connor used a test she had originally developed in \"City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health\" to limit the holding of \"Roe v. Wade\", opening up a legislative portal where a State could enact measures so long as they did not place an \"undue burden\" on a woman's right to an abortion. \"Casey\" revised downward the standard of scrutiny federal courts would apply to state abortion restrictions, a major departure from \"Roe\". However, it preserved \"Roe\"'s core constitutional precept: that the Fourteenth Amendment implies and protects a woman's fundamental right to control the outcomes of her reproductive actions. Writing the plurality opinion for the Court, O'Connor, along with Kennedy and Souter, famously declared: \"At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. Beliefs about these matters could not define the attributes of personhood were they formed under compulsion of the State.\"\nCommentary and analysis.\nO'Connor's case-by-case approach routinely placed her in the center of the Court and drew both criticism and praise. \"Washington Post\" columnist Charles Krauthammer, for example, described her as lacking a judicial philosophy and instead displaying \"political positioning embedded in a social agenda.\" Conservative commentator Ramesh Ponnuru wrote that, even though O'Connor \"has voted reasonably well\", her tendency to issue very case-specific rulings \"undermines the predictability of the law and aggrandizes the judicial role.\"\nLaw clerks serving the Court in 2000 speculated that the decision she reached in \"Bush v. Gore\" was based on a desire to appear fair, rather than on any legal rationale, pointing to a memo she sent out the night before the decision was issued that used entirely different logic to reach the same result. They also characterized her approach to cases as deciding on \"gut feelings\".\nOther activities while serving on the Court.\nIn 2003, she wrote a book titled \"The Majesty of the Law: Reflections of a Supreme Court Justice\" (). In 2005, she wrote a children's book, \"Chico: A True Story from the Childhood of the First Woman Supreme Court Justice\", named for her favorite horse, which offered an autobiographical depiction of her childhood.\nRetirement.\nOn December 12, 2000, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that O'Connor was reluctant to retire with a Democrat in the presidency: \"At an Election Night party at the Washington, D.C., home of Mary Ann Stoessel, widow of former Ambassador Walter Stoessel, the justice's husband, John O'Connor, mentioned to others her desire to step down, according to three witnesses. But Mr. O'Connor said his wife would be reluctant to retire if a Democrat were in the White House and would choose her replacement. Justice O'Connor declined to comment.\"\nBy 2005, the composition of the Court had been unchanged for eleven years, the second-longest period in American history without any such change. Rehnquist was widely expected to be the first justice to retire during Bush's term, owing to his age and his battle with cancer, although rumors of O'Connor's possible retirement circulated as well.\nOn July 1, 2005, O'Connor announced her intention to retire. In her letter to Bush, she stated that her retirement from active service would take effect upon the confirmation of her successor. Her letter did not provide a reason for her departure; however, a Supreme Court spokeswoman confirmed O'Connor was leaving to spend time with her husband.\nOn July 19, Bush nominated D.C. Circuit Judge John Roberts to succeed O'Connor. O'Connor heard the news over the car radio on the way back from a fishing trip. She described Roberts soon after the nomination as \"good in every way, except he's not a woman\".\nO'Connor had expected to leave the Court before the next term started on October 3, 2005. However, Rehnquist died on September 3, creating an immediate vacancy on the Court. Two days later, Bush withdrew Roberts as his nominee for her seat and instead appointed him to fill the vacant office of Chief Justice. O'Connor agreed to stay on the Court until her replacement was named and confirmed. She spoke at the late chief justice's funeral. On October 3, Bush nominated White House Counsel Harriet Miers to replace O'Connor. After much criticism and controversy over her nomination, on October 27, Miers asked Bush to withdraw her nomination. Bush accepted, reopening the search for O'Connor's successor.\nThe continued delays in confirming a successor further extended O'Connor's time on the Court. She continued to hear oral argument on cases, including cases dealing with controversial issues such as physician-assisted suicide and abortion. O'Connor's last Court opinion, \"Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of New England\", written for a unanimous court, was a procedural decision that involved a challenge to a New Hampshire abortion law.\nOn October 31, Bush nominated Third Circuit Judge Samuel Alito to replace O'Connor; Alito was confirmed by a 58\u201342 vote and was sworn in on January 31, 2006. After retiring, she continued to hear cases and rendered over a dozen opinions in federal appellate courts across the country, filling in as a substitute judge when vacations or vacancies left their three-member panels understaffed. On Alito's nomination, O'Connor said, \"I've often said, it's wonderful to be the first to do something but I didn't want to be the last. If I didn't do a good job, it might've been the last and indeed when I retired, I was not replaced, then, by a woman which gives one pause to think 'Oh, what did I do wrong that led to this.'\"\nPost-Supreme Court career.\nIn her retirement, O'Connor continued to speak and organize conferences on the issue of judicial independence. During a March 2006 speech at Georgetown University, O'Connor said some political attacks on the independence of the courts pose a direct threat to the constitutional freedoms of Americans. She said, \"Any reform of the system is debatable as long as it is not motivated by retaliation for decisions that political leaders disagree with.\" She also noting that she was \"against judicial reforms driven by nakedly partisan reasoning\". \"Courts interpret the law as it was written, not as the congressmen might have wished it was written\", and \"it takes a lot of degeneration before a country falls into dictatorship, but we should avoid these ends by avoiding these beginnings.\"\nOn November 19, 2008, O'Connor published an introductory essay on a themed judicial accountability issue in the \"Denver University Law Review\". She called for a better public understanding of judicial accountability. On November 7, 2007, at a conference on her landmark opinion in \"Strickland v. Washington\" (1984) sponsored by the Constitution Project, O'Connor highlighted the lack of proper legal representation for many of the poorest defendants. O'Connor also urged the creation of a system for \"merit selection for judges\", a cause for which she had frequently advocated.\nOn August 7, 2008, O'Connor and Abdurrahman Wahid, former President of Indonesia, wrote an editorial in the \"Financial Times\" stating concerns about the threatened imprisonment of Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim.\nIn October 2008, O'Connor spoke on racial equality in education at a conference hosted by the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice at Harvard Law School. Later in the conference, she was awarded the Charles Hamilton Houston Justice Award alongside Desmond Tutu and Dolores Huerta.\nFollowing the Court's \"Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission\" decision on corporate political spending, O'Connor offered measured criticism of the decision, telling Georgetown law students and lawyers, \"that the Court has created an unwelcome new path for wealthy interests to exert influence on judicial elections.\"\nO'Connor argued in favor of President Barack Obama naming the replacement for Antonin Scalia in February 2016, mere days after Scalia's death, opposing Republican arguments that the next president should get to fill the vacancy. She said, \"I think we need somebody there to do the job now and let's get on with it. ... You just have to pick the best person you can under the circumstances, as the appointing authority must do. It's an important position and one that we care about as a nation and as a people. And I wish the president well as he makes choices and goes down that line. It's hard.\"\nJudge William H. Pryor Jr., a conservative jurist, has criticized O'Connor's speeches and op-eds for hyperbole and factual inaccuracy, based in part on O'Connor's opinions as to whether judges face a rougher time in the public eye today than in the past.\nO'Connor reflected on her time on the Supreme Court by saying that she regretted the Court hearing the \"Bush v. Gore\" case in 2000 because it \"stirred up the public\" and \"gave the Court a less-than-perfect reputation\". She told the \"Chicago Tribune\" that \"maybe the Court should have said, 'We're not going to take it, goodbye,' ... It turned out the election authorities in Florida hadn't done a real good job there and kind of messed it up. And probably the Supreme Court added to the problem at the end of the day\".\nActivities and memberships.\nAs a retired Supreme Court justice, O'Connor continued to receive a full salary, maintained a staffed office with at least one law clerk, and heard cases on a part-time basis in federal district courts and courts of appeals as a visiting judge. By 2008, O'Connor had sat for cases with the 2nd, 8th, and 9th Circuits. O'Connor heard an Arizona voting rights case which the Supreme Court later reviewed. In \"Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona\", a 7\u20132 majority affirmed O'Connor and the rest of 9th Circuit panel, and struck down a provision of Arizona's voting registration law. O'Connor hired a law clerk for the October 2015 term, but did not hire a law clerk for the subsequent term.\nO'Connor was elected as an honorary fellow of the National Academy of Public Administration in 2005. In October that year, O'Connor accepted the largely ceremonial role of becoming the 23rd Chancellor of the College of William &amp; Mary. O'Connor continued in the role until 2012. O'Connor was a member of the 2006 Iraq Study Group, appointed by the U.S. Congress. From 2006, she was a trustee on the board of the Rockefeller Foundation. O'Connor chaired the Jamestown 2007 celebration, commemorating the 400th anniversary of the founding of the colony at Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. The Sandra Day O'Connor Project on the State of the Judiciary, named for O'Connor, held annual conferences from 2006 through 2008 on the independence of the judiciary. O'Connor was a member of both the American Philosophical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\nTeaching.\nIn 2006, O'Connor taught a course on the Supreme Court at the University of Arizona's James E. Rogers College of Law as a distinguished jurist in residence. On April 5, 2006, Arizona State University named its law school the Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law in her honor.\nPublishing.\nO'Connor wrote the 2013 book \"Out of Order: Stories from the History of the Supreme Court\".\nPublic speaking engagements.\nOn May 15, 2006, O'Connor gave the commencement address at the William &amp; Mary School of Law, where she said that judicial independence is \"under serious attack at both the state and national level\". In 2008, O'Connor was named an inaugural Harry Rathbun Visiting Fellow by the Office for Religious Life at Stanford University. On April 22, 2008, she gave \"Harry's Last Lecture on a Meaningful Life\" in honor of the former Stanford Law professor who shaped her undergraduate and law careers. On September 17, 2014, O'Connor appeared on the television show \"Jeopardy!\" and provided a couple of video answers to the category 'Supreme Court' which appeared on the show. On the same day in Concord, New Hampshire, she gave a talk alongside her former colleague Justice David Souter about the importance of meaningful civics education in the United States.\nNon-profits and philanthropic activity.\nIn February 2009, O'Connor launched Our Courts, a website she created to offer interactive civics lessons to students and teachers because she was concerned about the lack of knowledge among most young Americans about how their government works. She also served as a co-chair with Lee H. Hamilton for the Campaign for the Civic Mission of Schools. On March 3, 2009, O'Connor appeared on the satirical television program \"The Daily Show\" with Jon Stewart to promote the website. In August 2009, the website added two online interactive games. The initiative expanded, becoming iCivics in May 2010 offering free lesson plans, games, and interactive videogames for middle and high school educators. By 2015, the iCivics games had 72,000 teachers as registered users and its games had been played 30 million times.\nO'Connor served on the board of trustees of the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, a museum dedicated to the U.S. Constitution. By November 2015, O'Connor had transitioned to being a trustee emeritus for the center. In April 2013, the board of directors of Justice at Stake, a national judicial reform advocacy organization, announced that O'Connor would be joining the organization as honorary chair.\nIn 2009, O'Connor founded the 501(c)(3) non-profit organization now known as the Sandra Day O'Connor Institute. Its programs are dedicated to promoting civil discourse, civic engagement, and civics education. In 2019, her former adobe residence in Arizona, curated by the O'Connor Institute, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2022, the Institute launched Civics for Life, its multigenerational digital platform.\nO'Connor was a member and president of the Junior League of Phoenix.\nO'Connor was a founding co-chair of the National Advisory Board at the National Institute for Civil Discourse (NICD). The institute was created at the University of Arizona after the 2011 shooting of former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords that killed six people and wounded 13 others.\nPersonal life, illness and death.\nUpon her appointment to the Supreme Court, O'Connor and her husband moved to the Kalorama area of Washington, D.C. The O'Connors became active in the Washington, D.C. social scene. O'Connor played tennis and golf in her spare time. She was a baptized member of the Episcopal Church.\nO'Connor was successfully treated for breast cancer in 1988, and she also had her appendix removed that year. That same year, John O'Connor left the Washington, D.C., law firm of Miller &amp; Chevalier for a practice that required him to split his time between Washington, D.C. and Phoenix.\nHer husband suffered from Alzheimer's disease for nearly 20 years, until his death in 2009, and she became involved in raising awareness of the disease. After retiring from the Court, O'Connor moved back to Phoenix, Arizona.\nAround 2013, O'Connor's friends and colleagues noticed that she was becoming more forgetful and less talkative. By 2017, back problems led to her needing to use a wheelchair, and to her moving to an assisted living facility. In October 2018, O'Connor announced her effective retirement from public life after disclosing that she had been diagnosed with the early stages of dementia.\nOn May 7, 2016, her younger sister, Ann Day, was killed in a car accident in Tucson, Arizona, as a result of a collision with a drunk driver.\nOn December 1, 2023, O'Connor died in Phoenix, at the age of 93, due to complications related to advanced dementia and a respiratory illness. After her death, Chief Justice John Roberts called her \"an eloquent advocate for civil education\" and a \"fiercely independent defender of the rule of law\" in a public statement. President Joe Biden said she was an \"American icon\", dedicated to public service and the \"bedrock American principle of an independent judiciary\". iCivics board chairman Larry Kramer said that O'Connor was \"kind and generous\" and relayed that iCivics was her \"brainchild\".\nO'Connor lay in repose in the Great Hall of the Supreme Court on December 18, 2023. She was memorialized the following day in a funeral service held at the Washington National Cathedral.\nLegacy and awards.\nO'Connor was particularly remembered for being the first woman on the Court, and for functioning as the swing vote in the 5\u20134 decision in \"Bush v. Gore\", which handed the presidency to George W. Bush.\nOverall, she began her tenure on the court as a Reaganite but would later attempt to steer the court toward decisions that better aligned with public opinion. Some argue that O'Connor's jurisprudential legacy was largely undone by the appointment of Samuel Alito as her successor.\nIn March 2019, historian and journalist Evan Thomas published a memoir detailing O'Connor's life, pulling from interviews and her archives, and becoming a \"New York Times\" Bestseller and finalist for the \"Los Angeles Times\" Book Prize.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "42645", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42645", "title": "The Grapes of Wrath", "text": "1939 novel by John Steinbeck\nThe Grapes of Wrath is an American realist novel written by John Steinbeck and published in 1939. The book won the National Book Award\nand Pulitzer Prize for fiction, and it was cited prominently when Steinbeck was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1962.\nSet during the Great Depression, the novel focuses on the Joads, a poor family of tenant farmers driven from their Oklahoma home by drought, economic hardship, agricultural industry changes, and bank foreclosures forcing tenant farmers out of work. Due to their nearly hopeless situation, and in part because they are trapped in the Dust Bowl, the Joads set out for California on the \"mother road\", along with thousands of other \"Okies\" seeking jobs, land, dignity, and a future.\n\"The Grapes of Wrath\" is frequently read in American high school and college literature classes due to its historical context and enduring legacy. A Hollywood film version, starring Henry Fonda and directed by John Ford, was released in 1940.\nPlot.\nThe narrative begins just after Tom Joad is paroled from McAlester prison, where he had been incarcerated after being convicted of homicide in self-defense. While hitchhiking to his home near Sallisaw, Oklahoma, Tom meets former preacher Jim Casy, whom he remembers from childhood, and the two travel together. Arriving at Tom's childhood farm home, they find it deserted. Disconcerted and confused, Tom and Casy meet an old neighbor, Muley Graves, who says the family is at Uncle John Joad's home nearby. Graves says the banks have evicted all the farmers. They have moved away, but Muley refuses to leave the area.\nThe next morning, Tom and Casy go to Uncle John's. Tom's family is loading their remaining possessions into a Hudson sedan converted into a truck; with the crops destroyed by the Dust Bowl, the family has defaulted on their bank loans and their farm has been repossessed. The family sees no option but to seek work in California, which has been described in handbills as fruitful and offering high pay. The Joads put everything they have into making the journey. Although leaving Oklahoma violates his parole, Tom takes the risk, and invites Casy to join the family.\nTraveling west on Route 66, the Joads find the road crowded with other migrants. In makeshift camps, they hear many stories from others, some returning from California. The group worries that California may not be as rewarding as suggested. The family dwindles on the way: Grampa dies and they bury him in a field; Granma dies close to the California state line; and both Noah (the eldest Joad son) and Connie Rivers (the husband of the pregnant Joad daughter, Rose of Sharon) leave the family. Led by Ma, the remaining members continue on, as nothing is left for them in Oklahoma.\nReaching California, they find the state oversupplied with labor; wages are low, and workers are exploited to the point of starvation. The big corporate farmers are in collusion and smaller farmers suffer from collapsing prices. All police and state law enforcement authorities are allied with the growers. At the first migrant Hooverville camp the Joads stop at, Casy is arrested for knocking down a deputy sheriff who is about to shoot a fleeing worker for alerting others that the labor recruiter, travelling with the officer, will not pay the wages he is promising. Weedpatch Camp, one of the clean, utility-supplied camps operated by the Resettlement Administration, a New Deal agency, offers better conditions but does not have enough resources to care for all the needy families, and it does not provide work or food. Nonetheless, as a federal facility, the camp protects the migrants from harassment by local deputies.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHow can you frighten a man whose hunger is not only in his own cramped stomach but in the wretched bellies of his children? You can't scare him \u2013 he has known a fear beyond every other.\n\u2014Chapter 19\nIn response to the exploitation, Casy becomes a labor organizer and tries to recruit for a labor union. The Joads find work as strikebreakers in a peach orchard. After picking for most of the day, they are only paid enough to buy food for that night's supper and some for the next day. The next morning the peach plantation announces that the pay rate for the picked fruit has been reduced by half. Casy is involved in a strike that turns violent. When Tom witnesses Casy being struck and killed with a pickaxe, he kills the attacker and takes flight. The Joads quietly leave the orchard to work at a cotton farm while Tom hides in the nearby woods, still risking being arrested, and possibly lynched, for the homicide.\nAfter Ruthie taunts that her brother has killed two men, Tom, knowing he must leave to avoid capture, bids his mother farewell and vows to work for the oppressed. The family continues to pick cotton and pool their daily wages to buy food. Upon its birth, Rose of Sharon's baby is stillborn. Ma Joad remains steadfast and forces the family through the bereavement. With the winter rains, the Joads' dwelling is flooded and the car disabled, and they move to higher ground. In the final chapter of the book, the family takes shelter from the flood in an old barn. Inside they find a young boy and his father, who is dying of starvation. Ma realizes there is only one way to save the man. She looks at Rose of Sharon and a silent understanding passes between them. Rose of Sharon, left alone with the man, goes to him and has him drink her breast milk.\nInterchapters.\nThroughout the novel, short vignettes or \"interchapters\" describe the wider setting of the story. In one of these, a land turtle attempts to cross a dusty road. The turtle is not directly related to the overall story of the Joad family, but is generally symbolic of the slow persistence of the Joads and the Okies and others during the Dust Bowl and Great Depression years.\nIt is in one of the interchapters that the novel's title is used in the text.\nReligious interpretation.\nMany scholars have noted Steinbeck's use of Christian imagery within \"The Grapes of Wrath\". The largest implications lie with Tom Joad and Jim Casy, who are both interpreted as Christ-like figures at certain intervals within the novel. These two are often interpreted together, with Casy representing Jesus Christ in the early days of his ministry, up until his death, which is interpreted as representing the death of Christ. From there, Tom takes over, rising in Casy's place as the Christ figure risen from the dead.\nHowever, the religious imagery is not limited to these two characters. Scholars have regularly inspected other characters and plot points within the novel, including Ma Joad, Rose of Sharon, her stillborn child, and Uncle John. In an article first published in 2009, Ken Eckert even compared the migrants' movement west as a reversed version of the slaves' escape from Egypt in Exodus. Many of these extreme interpretations are brought on by Steinbeck's own documented beliefs, which Eckert himself refers to as \"unorthodox\".\nTo expand upon previous remarks in a journal, Leonard A. Slade lays out the chapters and how they represent each part of the slaves escaping from Egypt. Slade states \u201cChapters 1 through 10 correspond to bondage in Egypt (where the bank and land companies fulfill the role of Pharaoh), and the plagues (drought and erosion); chapters 11 through 18 to the Exodus and journey through the wilderness (during which the old people die off); and chapter 19 through 30 to the settlement in the Promised Land-California, whose inhabitants are hostile\u2026 formulate ethical codes (in the government camps)\u201d. \nAnother religious interpretation that Slade brings up in his writings is the title itself, stating \u201cThe title of the novel, of course refers to the line: He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored in Julia Ward Howe\u2019s famous Battle Hymn of the Republic. Apparently, then the title suggests, moreover, 'that story exists in Christian context, indicating that we should expect to find some Christian meaning'.\" These two interpretations by Slade and other scholars show how many religious aspects can be interpreted from the book. Along with Slade, other scholars find interpretations in the characters of Rose of Sharon and her stillborn child.\nDevelopment.\n\"The Grapes of Wrath\" developed from \"The Harvest Gypsies\", a series of seven articles that ran in the \"San Francisco News\", from October 5 to 12, 1936. The newspaper commissioned that work on migrant workers from the Midwest in California's agriculture industry. (It was later compiled and published separately.)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This is the beginning\u2014from \"I\" to \"we\". If you who own the things people must have could understand this, you might preserve yourself. If you could separate causes from results, if you could know that Paine, Marx, Jefferson, Lenin were results, not causes, you might survive. But that you cannot know. For the quality of owning freezes you forever into \"I\", and cuts you off forever from the \"we\".\u2014\u200a\nSteinbeck was known to have borrowed from field notes taken during 1938 by Farm Security Administration worker and author Sanora Babb. While she collected personal stories about the lives of the displaced migrants for a novel she was developing, her supervisor, Tom Collins, shared her reports with Steinbeck, who at the time was working for the \"San Francisco News\". Babb's own novel, \"Whose Names Are Unknown\", was eclipsed in 1939 by the success of \"The Grapes of Wrath\" and was shelved until it was finally published in 2004, a year before Babb's death.\nIn mid-January 1939, three months before the publication of \"The Grapes of Wrath\", Steinbeck wrote a long letter to Pascal Covici, his editor at Viking Press. He wanted Covici, in particular, to understand this book, to appreciate what he was up to. And so he concluded with a statement that might serve as preface in and of itself: \"Throughout I've tried to make the reader participate in the actuality, what he takes from it will be scaled on his own depth and shallowness. There are five layers in this book, a reader will find as many as he can and he won't find more than he has in himself.\"\nTitle.\nWhile writing the novel at his home, 16250 Greenwood Lane, in what is now Monte Sereno, California, Steinbeck had unusual difficulty devising a title. \"The Grapes of Wrath\", suggested by his wife Carol Steinbeck, was deemed more suitable than anything by the author. The title is a reference to lyrics from \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\", by Julia Ward Howe (emphasis added):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThese lyrics refer, in turn, to the biblical passage Revelation 14:19\u201320, an apocalyptic appeal to divine justice and deliverance from oppression in the final judgment. This and other biblical passages had inspired a long tradition of imagery of Christ in the winepress, in various media. The passage reads:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God. And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs.\nThe phrase also appears at the end of Chapter 25 in Steinbeck's book, which describes the purposeful destruction of food to keep the price high:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[A]nd in the eyes of the hungry there is a growing wrath. In the souls of the people the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy, growing heavy for the vintage.\nThe image invoked by the title serves as a crucial symbol in the development of both the plot and the novel's greater thematic concerns: from the terrible winepress of Dust Bowl oppression will come terrible wrath but also the deliverance of workers through their cooperation. This is suggested but not realized within the novel.\nAuthor's note.\nWhen preparing to write the novel, Steinbeck wrote: \"I want to put a tag of shame on the greedy bastards who are responsible for this [the Great Depression and its effects].\" He famously said, \"I've done my damnedest to rip a reader's nerves to rags.\" His work won a large following among the working class, due to his sympathy for the migrants and workers' movement, and his accessible prose style.\nCritical reception.\nSteinbeck scholar John Timmerman sums up the book's influence: \"\"The Grapes of Wrath\" may well be the most thoroughly discussed novel \u2013 in criticism, reviews, and college classrooms \u2013 of 20th century American literature.\" \"The Grapes of Wrath\" is referred to as a Great American Novel.\nAt the time of publication, Steinbeck's novel \"was a phenomenon on the scale of a national event. It was publicly banned and burned by citizens, it was debated on national radio; but above all, it was read\". According to \"The New York Times\", it was the best-selling book of 1939 and 430,000 copies had been printed by February 1940. In that same month, it won the National Book Award, favorite fiction book of 1939, voted by members of the American Booksellers Association. Soon, it won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, and its Armed Services Edition went through two printings.\nThe book was noted for Steinbeck's passionate depiction of the plight of the poor, and many of his contemporaries attacked his social and political views. Bryan Cordyack wrote: \"Steinbeck was attacked as a propagandist and a socialist from both the left and the right of the political spectrum. The most fervent of these attacks came from the Associated Farmers of California; they were displeased with the book's depiction of California farmers' attitudes and conduct toward the migrants. They denounced the book as a 'pack of lies' and labeled it 'communist propaganda'\". Some argued that his novel was filled with inaccuracies. In his book \"The Art of Fiction\" (1984), John Gardner criticized Steinbeck for not knowing anything about the California ranchers: \"Witness Steinbeck's failure in \"The Grapes of Wrath\". It should have been one of America's great books...[S]teinbeck wrote not a great and firm novel but a disappointing melodrama in which complex good is pitted against unmitigated, unbelievable evil.\" Others accused Steinbeck of exaggerating camp conditions to make a political point. He had visited the camps well before publication of the novel and argued their inhumane nature destroyed the settlers' spirit.\nIn 1962, the Nobel Prize committee cited \"The Grapes of Wrath\" as a \"great work\" and as one of the committee's main reasons for granting Steinbeck the Nobel Prize for Literature.\nIn 1999, French newspaper \"Le Monde\" of Paris ranked \"The Grapes of Wrath\" as seventh on its list of the 100 best books of the 20th century. In the UK, it was listed at number 29 among the \"nation's best loved novels\" on the BBC's 2003 survey The Big Read. In 2005, \"Time\" magazine included the novel in its \"100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005\". In 2009, \"The Daily Telegraph\" of the United Kingdom included the novel in its \"100 novels everyone should read\". \n\"The Grapes of Wrath\" has faced a great amount of controversy since publication, including book bans and other challenges on a variety of political and religious grounds in the United States and other countries. The early attempts to suppress and censor the book directly inspired the promulgation of the Library Bill of Rights by the American Library Association.\nSimilarities to \"Whose Names Are Unknown\".\nSanora Babb's \"Whose Names Are Unknown\" was written in the 1930s and published in 2004. Some scholars noted strong parallels between that work \u2014 the notes for which Steinbeck is widely believed to have examined \u2014 and \"The Grapes of Wrath\".\nWriting in \"The Steinbeck Review\", Michael J. Meyer noted numerous \"obvious similarities\" between the two novels \"that even a cursory reading will reveal\", such as Babb's account of two still-born babies, mirrored in Steinbeck's description of Rose of Sharon's baby. Among other scenes and themes repeated in both books: the villainy of banks, corporations, and company stores that charge exorbitant prices; the rejection of religion and the embrace of music as a means of preserving hope; descriptions of the fecundity of nature and agriculture, and the contrast with the impoverishment of the migrants; and the disparity between those willing to extend assistance to the migrants and others who view \"Okies\" as subhuman. Meyer, a Steinbeck bibliographer, stops short of labeling these parallels as plagiarism but concludes that \"Steinbeck scholars would do well to read Babb \u2014 if only to see for themselves the echoes of \"Grapes\" that abound in her prose.\"\nSteinbeck scholar David M. Wrobel wrote that \"the John Steinbeck/Sanora Babb story sounds like a classic smash-and-grab: celebrated California author steals the material of unknown Oklahoma writer, resulting in his financial success and her failure to get her work published ... Steinbeck absorbed field information from many sources, primarily Tom Collins and Eric H. Thomsen, regional director of the federal migrant camp program in California, who accompanied Steinbeck on missions of mercy...if Steinbeck read Babb\u2019s extensive notes as carefully as he did the reports of Collins, he would certainly have found them useful. His interaction with Collins and Thomsen \u2014 and their influence on the writing of \"The Grapes of Wrath\" \u2014 is documented because Steinbeck acknowledged both. Sanora Babb went unmentioned.\"\nWriting in \"Broad Street\" (magazine), Carla Dominguez described Babb as \"devastated and bitter\" that Random House cancelled publication of her own novel after \"The Grapes of Wrath\" was released in 1939. It is clear, she wrote, that \"Babb's retellings, interactions, and reflections were secretly read over and appropriated by Steinbeck. Babb met Steinbeck briefly and by chance at a lunch counter, but she never thought that he had been reading her notes because he did not mention it.\" When Babb's novel was finally published in 2004, she declared that she was a better writer than Steinbeck. \"His book\", Babb said, \"is not as realistic as mine.\"\nAdaptations.\nIn film.\nThe book was quickly made into a famed 1940 Hollywood movie of the same name directed by John Ford and starring Henry Fonda as Tom Joad. The first part of the film version follows the book fairly accurately. However, the second half and the ending, in particular, differ significantly from the book.

The band's first album \"Cracker\" was released in 1992 on Virgin Records; it included the single \"Teen Angst (What the World Needs Now)\", which went to No. 1 on the U.S. Modern Rock chart. The band's follow-up, the 1993 album \"Kerosene Hat\" included the hit songs \"Low,\" \"Get Off This\" and \"Euro-Trash Girl\". Cracker has released nine studio albums and several compilations, collaborations, solo projects and live albums. The band mix influences and sounds from rock, punk, grunge, psychedelia, country, blues and folk.\nHistory.\n1990s.\nShortly after Lowery's former group Camper Van Beethoven disbanded in 1990, he began demoing material along with boyhood friend guitarist Johnny Hickman. After moving from Redlands, California to Richmond, Virginia, Lowery and Hickman recorded a demo tape, later nicknamed \"Big Dirty Yellow Demos\" by the group's fans, which included early versions of songs that appeared on later albums. They eventually chose the name Cracker and teamed up with fellow Redlands bass guitarist Davey Faragher. A brief tour with Virginia drummer Go Weatherford followed.\nBy 1991, the newly formed band had signed a recording contract with Virgin Records and enlisted the help of several drummers/percussionists (Jim Keltner, Michael Urbano and Phil Jones), issuing its first album, \"Cracker\", in 1992. From the album came radio hit \"Teen Angst (What the World Needs Now)\", which peaked at No.\u00a01 on Modern Rock Tracks, and a second single entitled \"Happy Birthday to Me.\" The album went on to sell more than 200,000 copies.\nA year later, Cracker issued its best-selling album, \"Kerosene Hat\". The album included hit singles \"Low\" and \"Get Off This\" (both with official music videos directed by Carlos Grasso), as well as a cover of the Grateful Dead's \"Loser.\" The album sold almost half a million copies that year and eventually almost reached platinum status. Urbano performed on \"Kerosene Hat\" and toured with Cracker before leaving the band, along with Faragher. After a short spell with Bruce Hughes, Lowery and Hickman added Bob Rupe, formerly of The Silos, as bass guitarist and Charlie Quintana (Bob Dylan, The JuJu Hounds) on drums. In 1993, Cracker contributed the song \"Good Times Bad Times\" to the \"\" album. Initially, the band had recorded a rendition of \"When the Levee Breaks\" but it was deemed \"too weird.\"\nThree years later, \"The Golden Age\" was released, with \"I Hate My Generation\" as the lead single. However, the music scene was shifting away from guitar-driven alternative rock, and although critically acclaimed, the album sold only moderately. Following the long-term additions of drummer Frank Funaro and keyboard player Kenny Margolis, the band returned in 1998 with \"Gentleman's Blues,\" with \"The Good Life\" as the lead single. Although the album received only a lukewarm critical response, it solidified an ever-growing and devout following both in the United States and Europe who referred to themselves as \"Crumbs.\"\nIn 1995 the song \"Whole Lotta Trouble,\" co-written by Hickman and Chris LeRoy, was used in the film \"Empire Records\". The same year, Cracker's cover of the Flamin' Groovies song, \"Shake Some Action,\" was used in the teen romantic-comedy \"Clueless\".\nCamper Van Beethoven unexpectedly re-formed in 1999, and in 2004 released the critically acclaimed \"New Roman Times\". During this time, Hickman released a first solo recording, \"Palmhenge\", which received \"Voices Choice\" accolades in \"The Village Voice\" by the rock critic Robert Christgau and a positive review in \"Blender\" magazine. Since then, Lowery has performed in both Cracker and Camper Van Beethoven.\n2000s.\nA compilation album called \"Garage D'Or\" was released in 2000, with one disc composed of greatest hits and three new songs, and another of out-takes, soundtrack contributions, demos and other obscurities. Rupe departed in January 2000 and was replaced by bass guitarist Brandy Wood. In 2002, the band released its next studio album, \"Forever\" which, once again, met with limited commercial success.\nThe group left Virgin in 2003 with the independent release \"Countrysides\", composed of eight country and western covers and one new original song. A collaboration with the bluegrass band Leftover Salmon, \"Oh Cracker, Where Art Thou?\" (2003), contained bluegrass versions of many Lowery and Hickman compositions. In 2005, Cracker and Camper Van Beethoven started an annual three-night \"Campout\" at Pappy and Harriet's Pioneertown Palace in Pioneertown, California, close to where Lowery and Hickman met, in which they and several other bands perform, including sets by Cracker and Camper band members performing their own music. Previous years' guests have included Roger Clyne, John Doe, Neko Case, Ike Reilly, Ryan Bingham, Vermillion Lies, Jason Molina and Magnolia Electric Co, Built To Spill, Brant Bjork and the Bros, Clem Snide, Gram Rabbit and The Bellrays.\nWith Camper Van Beethoven bass guitarist Victor Krummenacher replacing Wood, the band released the studio album \"Greenland\" on June 6, 2006, and continued to tour extensively. After the departures of Margolis and Krummenacher, the band's lineup stabilized in 2007 around Hickman, Lowery, Funaro and new bass guitarist Sal Maida, who had played with Roxy Music.\nCracker released a new studio album entitled \"Sunrise in the Land of Milk and Honey\" to positive reviews on May 5, 2009. It was the band's first chart on the \"Billboard\" 200 in more than a decade, after having sold more than 3,000 copies in a week. This was in part due to the Triple A chart success of the album's lead single, \"Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out With Me,\" which was used in the television show \"Californication\".\n2010s.\nIn January 2011, Lowery released his first solo album, \"The Palace Guards\", on 429 Records. In March, Cracker announced Campout East, the east coast counterpart to their Campout festival, to be held in Crozet, Virginia. The first Campout East was held at Misty Mountain Camp Resort and was co-hosted by Sons of Bill. The second Campout East took place in Buena Vista, Virginia at Glen Maury Park on June 1\u20132, 2012.\nJohnny Hickman released a second solo album, \"Tilting\", in July 2012, while Cracker's song \"Low\" appeared in the 2012 film \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\" and again in \"The Wolverine\" and an episode of \"Hindsight\".\nDrummer Frank Funaro was unable to tour due to an injury to his arm that sidelined him for all of 2014.\nIn July 2014, a revival of the \"Kerosene Hat\" era lineup toured China. Lowery and Hickman were joined on the tour by original bassist Davey Faragher and former drummer Michael Urbano. Faragher and Urbano also joined the band in recording roughly half of the double album \"Berkeley to Bakersfield\". The other half was recorded with an entirely new lineup that also became the current touring lineup. The album was released on December 9, 2014, with \"Waited My Whole Life\" released as a single.\nIn December 2015, Lowery (along with Camper Van Beethoven) filed a class action lawsuit against music streaming service Spotify, alleging that Spotify knowingly and unlawfully reproduced and distributed copyrighted recordings without obtaining proper music licenses. On 12 March 2018, drummer Charlie Quintana died from a heart attack. In February 2025, bass guitarist Sal Maida died. On 3 March 2025, Bob Rupe died aged 68.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "42648", "revid": "764861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42648", "title": "Cracker (British TV series)", "text": "British television crime drama series (1993\u20132006)\nCracker is a British crime drama series produced by Granada Television for ITV, created and principally written by Jimmy McGovern. Set in Manchester, the series follows a criminal psychologist (or \"cracker\"), Dr Edward \"Fitz\" Fitzgerald, played by Robbie Coltrane, who works with the Greater Manchester Police (GMP) to help them solve crimes.\nThe show consists of three series, originally broadcast from 1993 to 1995. A 100-minute special set in Hong Kong followed in 1996 and another two-hour story in 2006. The show won the British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series in 1995 and 1996, and Coltrane received the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor in three consecutive years (1994 to 1996).\nOverview.\nFitz is Scottish of Irish origin, alcoholic, a chain smoker, obese, sedentary, addicted to gambling, manic, foul-mouthed and sarcastic, yet cerebral and brilliant. He is a genius in his speciality: criminal psychology. As Fitz confesses in \"Brotherly Love\": \"I drink too much, I smoke too much, I gamble too much. I \"am\" too much.\"\nEach case spanned several episodes and cliffhangers were quite often used, but it was not until the end of the second series that a cliffhanger was employed to tie off the series. Some of the plotlines in the cases took as their starting point real events such as the Hillsborough disaster, whilst others were purely fictional with only tangential ties to actual events.\nSeveral different psychotic types were explored during the run of the show with increasingly complex psychological motivations that, as the series entered the middle of the second series, began to expand beyond the criminals being investigated to the regular cast members. As the series moved forward, the storylines became as much about the interactions of the regulars as they were about the crimes. In many later episodes the crimes often became background to intense, provocative explorations of the police officers' reactions to the crimes they investigated.\nTo emphasise how fine a line the police (and Fitz) walk in their close association with criminals, all three series featured several stories in which the police become victims of crime or themselves commit criminal acts such as murder, rape, obstruction of justice and assault and battery.\nProduction.\nThe first two series were written by Jimmy McGovern, excepting the fifth serial, \"The Big Crunch\", which was contributed by Ted Whitehead. Claiming that he had \"nothing more to write about\u201d, McGovern originally planned to leave after the second series but was allowed to write the controversial rape storyline, \"Men Should Weep\", when he agreed to contribute a three-part story to the third series. Two of McGovern's stories, \"To Say I Love You\" and \"Brotherly Love\" (from the first and third series respectively), received Edgar Awards from the Mystery Writers of America. Each serial had a different director, with the exceptions of \"To Be a Somebody\" and \"True Romance\", both directed by Tim Fywell.\nPaul Abbott, who had produced the second series, wrote the remainder of the episodes (including the feature-length special \"White Ghost\"). Abbott later went on to create several high-profile dramas, including \"Touching Evil\" (1997), \"State of Play\" (2003) and \"Shameless\" (2004). Another crew member, Nicola Shindler, who worked as script editor on the programme, later went on to found Red Production Company.\nOf the regular cast, only Coltrane and Tomlinson featured in \"White Ghost\" (retitled \"Lucky White Ghost\" for some overseas markets), which was set in Hong Kong. Although the series was still drawing large audiences after \"White Ghost\", Coltrane declined to return as Fitz unless McGovern returned to write the series.\n\"Cracker\" returned a decade after \"White Ghost\" in the 2006 special episode, \"Nine Eleven\", written by McGovern and directed by Antonia Bird. Coltrane, Flynn and O'Brien were the only actors to return in their previous roles. The new roles of DCI Walters, DS Saleh and DS McAllister were played by Richard Coyle, Nisha Nayar and Rafe Spall respectively. The story involved Fitz returning to Manchester after several years of living in Australia with Judith and his son James (who had been born during the third series) to attend his daughter Katy's wedding. The murder of an American nightclub comedian sends the police to ask Fitz for his help.\nLocations.\nThe series was principally filmed in south Manchester, at locations including Didsbury (where Fitz lived at the fictitious address of \"15 Charlotte Road\") and the police station at Longsight. The internals for the police station were filmed in the old \"Daily Mirror\" offices in central Manchester, now The Printworks retail complex. Other Manchester locations included Victoria Railway Station, St Peter's Square, Old Trafford, the Arndale Centre, UMIST, University of Salford, the Ramada Hotel, The Star and Garter (interior and exterior for the \"Best Boys\" episode) and the Safeway supermarket (now Morrisons) in Chorlton-cum-Hardy. The Hulme Crescents were also used for filming in the first two episodes of series one and the first episode of series two; during which time they were being demolished. The first episode involved several railway scenes which were filmed on the East Lancashire Railway in Bury (north Manchester) both on the trackside and inside the Carriage &amp; Wagon Works, where working volunteers from the railway used crowbars to push the carriage springs up and down to suggest a moving train, while water was poured on the windows to suggest rain between black polythene sheets and the window to indicate darkness.\nInfluences.\n\"Cracker\" storylines often begin by showing the crime being committed, a format popularised by \"Columbo\". Both series feature a lead character who solves crimes while masking an intelligent, perceptive nature behind a slobbish exterior, a debt acknowledged by \"Cracker\" creator Jimmy McGovern; Fitz delivers his summing-up in \"To Say I Love You\" while doing a Peter Falk impression.\nThe series' conception was also partly a reaction against the police procedural approach of fellow Granada crime serial \"Prime Suspect\", placing more emphasis on emotional and psychological truth than on correct police procedure. In an interview with the \"NME\", McGovern dismissed \"Prime Suspect\", noting that \"Good TV writing has narrative simplicity and emotional complexity,\" and characterising the series as \"A narratively complex story going up its own arse.\" Gub Neal, who produced the first series of \"Cracker\", is quoted as saying, \"That we had adopted the right approach was confirmed for me when Jacky Malton, the senior woman police officer who advised on \"Prime Suspect\", said that although the way things happened in \"Cracker\" was sometimes highly improbable, the relationships between the police were in many ways much more credible than they had been in \"Prime Suspect\".\"\nHome media.\nIn the United States, all three series of \"Cracker\" were released through HBO Home Video between 2003 and 2004, with the \"White Ghost/Lucky White Ghost\" special being included with series three. \"A New Terror\" and a complete series set were made available from Acorn DVD in 2007 and 2009, respectively.\nIn the United Kingdom, the series was never made available in the complete individual series forms, but rather in their separate story arcs from each series. All stories that make up the three series and the \"White Ghost\" special were released from Cinema Club in 2003. All the episodes were re-released, as well as a new release for \"A New Terror\" (known simply as \"Cracker\" for the DVD release) and a complete collection set, were made available in 2006 from ITV DVD. The complete series set was re-issued from ITV DVD in 2008.\nIn Australia, the series was initially released by Shock Records in 2007, who released series one, two and three individually, as well as a set comprising the two specials. The original complete series boxset from Shock contained all series, but excluded the specials, while a re-release of the boxset contained every episode, made available in 2008. Roadshow Entertainment re-released all three series and the two specials individually in 2012. Madman Entertainment acquired distribution rights to the series, and released a complete series boxset in 2024.\nOther versions.\nIn 1997, a short spoof episode, \"Prime Cracker\", was produced for the BBC's biennial Red Nose Day charity telethon in aid of Comic Relief. A crossover with ITV stablemate crime drama \"Prime Suspect\", the spoof starred Coltrane and \"Prime Suspect\" lead Helen Mirren as their characters from the respective series, sending up both shows.\nIn 1997, a 16-episode U.S. version of \"Cracker\" \u2014 directed by Stephen Cragg and Michael Fields \u2014 was made, starring Robert Pastorelli in Coltrane's role. The original UK story lines were transferred to Los Angeles. The series finished after the first season. It was broadcast in the UK, retitled \"Fitz\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "42649", "revid": "4850051", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42649", "title": "Max Ernst", "text": "German artist (1891\u20131976)\nMax Ernst (; 2 April 1891 \u2013 1 April 1976) was a German-born painter, sculptor, printmaker, graphic artist, and poet. A prolific artist, Ernst was a primary pioneer of the Dada movement and surrealism in Europe. He had no formal artistic training, but his experimental attitude toward the making of art resulted in his invention of frottage\u2014a technique that uses pencil rubbings of textured objects and relief surfaces to create images\u2014and grattage, an analogous technique in which paint is scraped across canvas to reveal the imprints of the objects placed beneath. Ernst is noted for his unconventional drawing methods as well as for creating novels and pamphlets using the method of collages. He served as a soldier for four years during World War I, and this experience left him shocked, traumatised and critical of the modern world. During World War II he was designated an \"undesirable foreigner\" while living in France.\nErnst was born in Br\u00fchl. He began painting in 1909 while studying at the University of Bonn, and later joined the Die Rheinischen Expressionisten group of artists. Ernst's work often featured ironic juxtapositions of grotesque elements with cubist and expressionist motifs. He had a fascination with birds, often including his alter ego, Loplop, a bird, in his work. He eventually settled in France and achieved financial success in the 1950s. He died in Paris on 1 April 1976.\nEarly life.\nMax Ernst was born in Br\u00fchl, south of Cologne, the third of nine children of a middle-class Catholic family. His father Philipp was a teacher of the deaf and an amateur painter, a devout Christian and a strict disciplinarian. He inspired in Max a penchant for defying authority, while his interest in painting and sketching in nature influenced Max to take up painting. \nIn 1909, Max Ernst enrolled in the University of Bonn, to read philosophy, art history, literature, psychology, and psychiatry. He visited asylums and became fascinated with the art work of the mentally ill patients; he also began painting that year, producing sketches in the garden of the Br\u00fchl castle, and portraits of his sister and himself. In 1911, Max befriended August Macke and joined his \"Die Rheinischen Expressionisten\" group of artists, deciding to become an artist.\nIn 1912, Max Ernst visited the Sonderbund exhibition in Cologne, where works by Pablo Picasso and post-Impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin profoundly influenced him. His work was exhibited that year together with that of the Das Junge Rheinland group, at Galerie Feldman in Cologne, and then in several group exhibitions in 1913. In his paintings of this period, Ernst adopted an ironic style that juxtaposed grotesque elements alongside Cubist and Expressionist motifs.\nIn 1914, Ernst met Hans Arp in Cologne. The two became friends and their relationship lasted for fifty years. After Ernst completed his studies in the summer, his life was interrupted by World War I. Ernst was drafted and served both on the Western and the Eastern Fronts. The effect of the war on Ernst was devastating; in his autobiography, he wrote of his time in the army thus: \"On the first of August 1914 M[ax].E[rnst]. died. He was resurrected on the eleventh of November 1918\". For a brief period on the Western Front, Ernst was assigned to chart maps, which allowed him to continue painting. Several German Expressionist painters died in action during the war, among them August Macke and Franz Marc.\nDada and surrealism.\nIn 1918, Ernst was demobilised and returned to Cologne. He soon married art history student Luise Straus, of Jewish ancestry, whom he had met in 1914. In 1919, he visited Paul Klee in Munich and studied paintings by Giorgio de Chirico. In the same year, inspired by de Chirico and mail-order catalogues, teaching-aide manuals and similar sources, he produced his first collages (notably \"Fiat modes\", a portfolio of lithographs), a technique which later dominated his artistic pursuits. Also in 1919, Ernst, social activist Johannes Theodor Baargeld and several colleagues founded the Cologne Dada group. In 1919\u201320, Ernst and Baargeld published various short-lived magazines such as \"Der Strom\", \"die Schammade\" and organised Dada exhibitions.\nErnst and Luise's son Ulrich 'Jimmy' Ernst was born on 24 June 1920; he later would also become a painter. Ernst's marriage to Luise was short-lived. In 1921, he met Paul \u00c9luard, who became a lifelong friend. \u00c9luard bought two of Ernst's paintings (\"Celebes\" and \"Oedipus Rex\") and selected six collages to illustrate his poetry collection \"R\u00e9p\u00e9titions\". A year later the two collaborated on \"Les malheurs des immortels\" and then with Andr\u00e9 Breton, whom Ernst met in 1921, on the magazine \"Litt\u00e9rature\". In 1922, unable to secure the necessary papers, Ernst entered France illegally and settled into a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois with \u00c9luard and his wife Gala in the Paris suburb of Saint-Brice, leaving behind his wife and son. During his first two years in Paris, Ernst took various odd jobs to make a living and continued to paint. In 1923, the \u00c9luards moved to a new home in Eaubonne north of Paris, where Ernst painted numerous murals. The same year his works were exhibited at \"Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants\".\nAlthough apparently accepting the m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois, \u00c9luard eventually became more concerned about the affair. In 1924, he abruptly left, first for Monaco and then for Saigon, Vietnam. He soon asked his wife and Max Ernst to join him; both had to sell paintings to finance the trip. Ernst went to D\u00fcsseldorf and sold a large number of his works to a long-time friend, Johanna Ey, owner of gallery \"Das Junge Rheinland\". After a brief time together in Saigon, the trio decided that Gala would remain with Paul. The \u00c9luards returned to Eaubonne in early September, while Ernst followed them some months later, after exploring more of southeast Asia. He returned to Paris in late 1924 and soon signed a contract with Jacques Viot which allowed him to paint full-time. In 1925, Ernst established a studio at 22, rue Tourlaque.\nIn 1925, Ernst invented a graphic art technique called frottage (see surrealist techniques), which uses pencil rubbings of objects as a source of images. He also created the 'grattage' technique, in which paint is scraped across canvas to reveal the imprints of the objects placed beneath. He used this technique in his famous painting \"Forest and Dove\" (as shown at the Tate Modern). The next year he collaborated with Joan Mir\u00f3 on designs for Sergei Diaghilev. With Mir\u00f3's help, Ernst developed grattage, in which he trowelled pigment from his canvases. He also explored with the technique of decalcomania, which involves pressing paint between two surfaces. Ernst was also active, along with fellow surrealists, at the Atelier 17.\nErnst developed a fascination with birds which was prevalent in his work. His alter ego in paintings, which he called Loplop, was a bird. He suggested that this alter-ego was an extension of himself stemming from an early confusion of birds and humans. He said that one night when he was young, he woke up and found that his beloved bird had died; a few minutes later, his father announced that his sister was born. Loplop often appeared in collages of other artists' work, such as \"Loplop presents Andr\u00e9 Breton\". Ernst drew a great deal of controversy with his 1926 painting \"The Virgin Chastises the infant Jesus before Three Witnesses: Andr\u00e9 Breton, Paul \u00c9luard, and the Painter\". In 1927, he married Marie-Berthe Aurenche and it is thought his relationship with her may have inspired the erotic subject matter of \"The Kiss\" and other works of that year. He appeared in the 1930 film \"L'\u00c2ge d'Or\", directed by the surrealist Luis Bu\u00f1uel. Ernst began to sculpt in 1934 and spent time with Alberto Giacometti. In 1938, the American heiress and artistic patron Peggy Guggenheim acquired a number of Max Ernst's works, which she displayed in her new gallery in London. Ernst and Guggenheim were married from 1942 to 1946.\nWorld War II and later life.\nIn September 1939, the outbreak of World War II caused Ernst, being German, to be interned as an \"undesirable foreigner\" in Camp des Milles, near Aix-en-Provence, along with fellow surrealist, Hans Bellmer, who had recently emigrated to Paris. He had been living with his lover and fellow surrealist painter, Leonora Carrington who, not knowing whether he would return, saw no option but to sell their house in Saint-Martin-d'Ard\u00e8che to repay their debts and leave for Spain. Thanks to the intercession of Paul \u00c9luard and other friends, including the journalist Varian Fry, he was released a few weeks later. Soon after the German occupation of France, he was arrested again, this time by the Gestapo, but managed to escape to America with the help of Fry and Peggy Guggenheim, a member of a wealthy American art collecting family. Ernst and Peggy Guggenheim arrived in the United States in 1941 and were married at the end of the year. Along with other artists and friends (Marcel Duchamp and Marc Chagall) who had fled from the war and lived in New York City, Ernst helped inspire the development of abstract expressionism.\nHis marriage to Guggenheim did not last. In October 1946 he married American surrealist painter Dorothea Tanning in a double ceremony with Man Ray and Juliet P. Browner in Beverly Hills, California. The couple made their home in Sedona, Arizona from 1946 to 1953, where the high desert landscapes inspired them and recalled Ernst's earlier imagery. Although Sedona was remote and populated by fewer than 400 ranchers, orchard workers, merchants and small Native American communities, their presence helped begin what would become an American artists' colony. Among the monumental red rocks, Ernst built a small cottage with his own hands on Brewer Road and he and Tanning hosted intellectuals and European artists such as Henri Cartier-Bresson and Yves Tanguy. Sedona proved an inspiration for the artists and for Ernst, who compiled his book \"Beyond Painting\" and completed his sculptural masterpiece \"Capricorn\" while living in Sedona. As a result of the book and its publicity, Ernst began to achieve financial success. From the 1950s he lived mainly in France. In 1954 he was awarded the Grand Prize for painting at the Venice Biennale. He died at the age of 84 on 1 April 1976 in Paris and was interred at P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery.\nLegacy.\nErnst's son Jimmy Ernst, a well-known German/American abstract expressionist painter, who lived on the south shore of Long Island, New York died in 1984. His memoirs, \"A Not-So-Still Life\", were published shortly before his death. Max Ernst's grandson Eric and his granddaughter Amy are both artists and writers.\nMax Ernst's life and career are examined in Peter Schamoni's 1991 documentary \"Max Ernst\". Dedicated to the art historian Werner Spies, it was assembled from interviews with Ernst, stills of his paintings and sculptures, and the memoirs of his wife Dorothea Tanning and son Jimmy. The 101-minute German film was released on DVD with English subtitles by Image Entertainment.\nThe Max Ernst Museum opened in 2005 in his home town Br\u00fchl, Germany. It is housed in a late-classicist 1844 building integrated with a modern glass pavilion. The historic ballroom was once a popular social venue visited by Ernst in his youth. The collection spans 70 years of his career including paintings, drawings, frottages, collages, nearly the entire lithographic works, over 70 bronze sculptures. and more than 700 documents and photographs by Man Ray, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Lee Miller, and others. The core of the collection dates back to 1969 with works donated to the City of Br\u00fchl by the artist. Thirty-six paintings, gifts from the artist to his fourth wife Dorothea Tanning, are on permanent loan from the Kreissparkasse K\u00f6ln. Some noteworthy works include the sculptures \"The King playing with the Queen\" (1944) and \"Teaching Staff for a School of Murderers\" (1967). The museum also host temporary exhibitions by other artist.\nThe Menil Collection, in Houston houses a significant collection of surrealist art including well over 100 pieces by Max Ernst. Notable paintings include \"In Praise of Freedom\" (1926), \"Loplop Presents Loplop\" (1930), \"Day and Night\" (1941\u20131942), \"Surrealism and Painting\" (1942), \"Euclid\" (1945), \"A Swarm of Bees in the Palais de Justice\" (1960), \"The Marriage of Heaven and Earth\" (1964). Ernst's work in the Menil Collection is typically exhibited a few pieces at a time along with other surrealist art in the collection on a rotating basis.\nExhibitions, retrospectives, and honors.\nDocumentary images\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "42650", "revid": "50840755", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42650", "title": "Marcel Duchamp", "text": "French painter, sculptor, and chess player (1887\u20131968)\nHenri-Robert-Marcel Duchamp (, ; ; 28 July 1887 \u2013 2 October 1968) was a French American artist, chess player, and inventor who played a key role in the development of the avant-garde in the United States and in New York City, where he spent the last 25 years of his life.\nDuchamp was the first artist to elevate a toilet to the status of an art form. By the time of World War I, he had rejected the work of many of his fellow artists (such as Henri Matisse) as \"retinal,\" intended only to please the eye. Instead, he wanted to use art to serve the mind. He is commonly regarded, along with Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, as one of the three artists who helped to establish the post-industrial perspective in art history, and he is considered the progenitor of Conceptual art.\nEarly life and education.\nEugene and Lucie Duchamp had seven children, one of whom died as an infant and four of whom became successful artists: Jacques Villon (1875\u20131963), painter, printmaker, Raymond Duchamp-Villon (1876\u20131918), sculptor and Suzanne Duchamp-Crotti (1889\u20131963), painter, have been the subject of exhibitions alongside Marcel Duchamp. Duchamp was close to his sister Suzanne. At eight years old, Duchamp began schooling at the Lyc\u00e9e Pierre-Corneille, in Rouen. Two other students in his class also became well-known artists and lasting friends: Robert Antoine Pinchon and Pierre Dumont. He studied art at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian from 1904 to 1905, but preferred playing billiards to attending classes, and the Acad\u00e9mie Julian was one of several \"independent\" academies that sprang up in reaction to the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. In 1905, Duchamp began his compulsory military service with the 39th Infantry Regiment, working for a printer in Rouen. There he learned typography and printing processes\u2014skills he would use in his later work.\nEarly work.\nOwing to his eldest brother Jacques' membership in the prestigious Acad\u00e9mie royale de peinture et de sculpture Duchamp's work was exhibited in the 1908 Salon d'Automne, and the following year in the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants. Fauves and Paul C\u00e9zanne's proto-Cubism influenced his paintings, although the critic Guillaume Apollinaire\u2014who was eventually to become a friend\u2014criticized what he called \"Duchamp's very ugly nudes\" (\"les nus tr\u00e8s vilains de Duchamp\"), he also prophesized that Duchamp could reconcile art and the people. \nDuring this period, Duchamp's fascination with transition, change, movement, and distance became manifest, and as many artists of the time, he was intrigued with the concept of depicting the fourth dimension in art. His painting \"Sad Young Man on a Train\" embodies this concern:\nFirst, there's the idea of the movement of the train, and then that of the sad young man who is in a corridor and who is moving about; thus there are two parallel movements corresponding to each other. Then, there is the distortion of the young man\u2014I had called this \"elementary parallelism\". It was a formal decomposition; that is, linear elements following each other like parallels and distorting the object. The object is completely stretched out, as if elastic. The lines follow each other in parallels, while changing subtly to form the movement, or the form of the young man in question. I also used this procedure in the \"Nude Descending a Staircase\".\nWorks from this time also included his first \"machine\" painting, \"Coffee Mill (Moulin \u00e0 caf\u00e9)\" (1911), which he gave to his brother Raymond Duchamp-Villon. The later more figurative machine painting of 1914, \"Chocolate Grinder\" (\"Broyeuse de chocolat\"), prefigures the mechanism incorporated into the \"Large Glass\" on which he began work in New York the following year.\n\"Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2\".\nDuchamp's first work to provoke significant controversy was \"Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2\" \"(Nu descendant un escalier n\u00b0 2)\" (1912). The painting depicts the mechanistic motion of a nude, with superimposed facets, similar to motion pictures. It shows elements of the fragmentation and synthesis of the \"Cubists\", as well as the movement and dynamism of the Futurists.\nHe first submitted the piece to appear at the Cubist Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants, but Albert Gleizes (according to Duchamp in an interview with Pierre Cabanne, p. 31) asked Duchamp's brothers to have him voluntarily withdraw the painting, or to paint over the title that he had painted on the work and rename it something else. Duchamp's brothers did approach him with Gleizes' request, but Duchamp quietly refused. However, there was no jury at the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants and Gleizes was in no position to reject the painting. The controversy, according to art historian Peter Brooke, was not whether the work should be hung or not, but whether it should be hung with the Cubist group.\nOf the incident Duchamp later recalled, \"I said nothing to my brothers. But I went immediately to the show and took my painting home in a taxi. It was really a turning point in my life, I can assure you. I saw that I would not be very much interested in groups after that.\" Yet Duchamp did appear in the illustrations to \"Du \"Cubisme\"\", he participated in the \"La Maison Cubiste (Cubist House)\", organized by the designer Andr\u00e9 Mare for the Salon d'Automne of 1912 (a few months after the Ind\u00e9pendants); he signed the Section d'Or invitation and participated in the Section d'Or exhibition during the fall of 1912. The impression is, Brooke writes, \"it was precisely because he wished to remain part of the group that he withdrew the painting; and that, far from being ill treated by the group, he was given a rather privileged position, probably through the patronage of Picabia\".\nThe painting was exhibited for the first time at Galeries Dalmau, \"Exposici\u00f3 d'Art Cubista\", Barcelona, 1912, the first exhibition of Cubism in Spain. Duchamp later submitted the painting to the 1913 \"Armory Show\" in New York City. In addition to displaying works of American artists, this show was the first major exhibition of modern trends coming out of Paris, encompassing experimental styles of the European avant-garde, including Fauvism, Cubism, and Futurism. American show-goers, accustomed to realistic art, were scandalized, and the \"Nude\" was at the center of much of the controversy.\nLeaving \"retinal art\" behind.\nAt about this time, Duchamp read Max Stirner's philosophical tract, \"The Ego and Its Own\", the study which he considered another turning point in his artistic and intellectual development. He called it \"a remarkable book ... which advances no formal theories, but just keeps saying that the ego is always there in everything.\"\nWhile in Munich in 1912, he painted the last of his Cubist-like paintings. He started \"The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even\" image, and began making plans for \"The Large Glass\" \u2013 scribbling short notes to himself, sometimes with hurried sketches. It would be more than ten years before this piece was completed. Not much else is known about the two-month stay in Munich except that the friend he visited was intent on showing him the sights and the nightlife, and that he was influenced by the works of the sixteenth century German painter Lucas Cranach the Elder in Munich's famed Alte Pinakothek, known for its Old Master paintings. Duchamp recalled that he took the short walk to visit this museum daily. Duchamp scholars have long recognized in Cranach the subdued ochre and brown color range Duchamp later employed.\nThe same year, Duchamp also attended a performance of a stage adaptation of Raymond Roussel's 1910 novel, \"Impressions d'Afrique,\" which featured plots that turned in on themselves, word play, surrealistic sets and humanoid machines. He credited the drama with having radically changed his approach to art, and having inspired him to begin the creation of his \"The Bride Stripped Bare By Her Bachelors, Even\", also known as \"The Large Glass\". Work on \"The Large Glass\" continued into 1913, with his invention of a repertoire of forms. He made notes, sketches and painted studies, and even drew some of his ideas on the wall of his apartment.\nToward the end of 1912, he traveled with Picabia, Apollinaire and Gabrielle Buffet-Picabia through the Jura mountains, an adventure that Buffet-Picabia described as one of their \"forays of demoralization, which were also forays of witticism and clownery ... the disintegration of the concept of art\". Duchamp's notes from the trip avoid logic and sense, and have a surrealistic, mythical connotation.\nDuchamp painted few canvases after 1912, and in those he did, he attempted to remove \"painterly\" effects, and to use a technical drawing approach instead.\nHis broad interests led him to an exhibition of aviation technology during this period, after which Duchamp said to his friend Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i, \"Painting is washed up. Who will ever do anything better than that propeller? Tell me, can you do that?\". Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i later sculpted bird forms. U.S. Customs officials mistook them for aviation parts and attempted to collect import duties on them.\nIn 1913, Duchamp withdrew from painting circles and began working as a librarian in the Biblioth\u00e8que Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve to be able to earn a living wage while concentrating on scholarly realms and working on his \"Large Glass\". He studied math and physics \u2013 areas where exciting new discoveries were taking place. The theoretical writings of Henri Poincar\u00e9 particularly intrigued and inspired Duchamp. Poincar\u00e9 postulated that the laws believed to govern matter were created solely by the minds that \"understood\" them and that no theory could be considered \"true\". \"The things themselves are not what science can reach..., but only the relations between things. Outside of these relations there is no knowable reality\", Poincar\u00e9 wrote in 1902. Reflecting the influence of Poincar\u00e9's writings, Duchamp tolerated any interpretation of his art by regarding it as the creation of the person who formulated it, not as truth.\nDuchamp's own art-science experiments began during his tenure at the library. To make one of his favorite pieces, \"3 Standard Stoppages\" (\"3 stoppages \u00e9talon\"), he dropped three 1-meter lengths of thread onto prepared canvases, one at a time, from a height of 1 meter. The threads landed in three random undulating positions. He varnished them into place on the blue-black canvas strips and attached them to glass. He then cut three wood slats into the shapes of the curved strings, and put all the pieces into a croquet box. Three small leather signs with the title printed in gold were glued to the \"stoppage\" backgrounds. The piece appears to literally follow Poincar\u00e9's \"School of the Thread\", part of a book on classical mechanics.\nIn his studio he mounted a bicycle wheel upside down onto a stool, spinning it occasionally just to watch it. Although it is often assumed that the \"Bicycle Wheel\" represents the first of Duchamp's \"Readymades\", this particular installation was never submitted for any art exhibition, and it was eventually lost. However, initially, the wheel was simply placed in the studio to create atmosphere: \"I enjoyed looking at it just as I enjoy looking at the flames dancing in a fireplace.\"\nAfter World War I started in August 1914, with his brothers and many friends in military service and himself exempted (due to a heart murmur), Duchamp felt uncomfortable in Paris. Meanwhile, \"Nude Descending a Staircase No. 2\" had scandalized Americans at the Armory Show, and helped secure the sale of all four of his paintings in the exhibition. Thus, being able to finance the trip, Duchamp decided to emigrate to the United States in 1915. To his surprise, he found he was a celebrity when he arrived in New York in 1915, where he quickly befriended art patron Katherine Dreier and artist Man Ray. Duchamp's circle included art patrons Louise and Walter Conrad Arensberg, actress and artist Beatrice Wood and Francis Picabia, as well as other avant-garde figures. Though he spoke little English, in the course of supporting himself by giving French lessons, and through some library work, he quickly learned the language. Duchamp became part of an artist colony in Ridgefield, New Jersey, across the Hudson River from New York City.\nFor two years the Arensbergs, who would remain his friends and patrons for 42 years, were the landlords of his studio. In lieu of rent, they agreed that his payment would be \"The Large Glass\". An art gallery offered Duchamp $10,000 per year in exchange for all of his yearly production, but he declined the offer, preferring to continue his work on \"The Large Glass\".\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme.\nDuchamp created the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme in 1920, along with Katherine Dreier and Man Ray, as an experimental exhibition context that predates the Museum of Modern Art as the first modern art collection in the US. \nDada.\nDada or Dadaism was an art movement of the European avant-garde in the early 20th century. It began in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland, in 1916, and spread to Berlin shortly thereafter. To quote Dona Budd's \"The Language of Art Knowledge\",\nDada was born out of negative reaction to the horrors of World War I. This international movement was begun by a group of artists and poets associated with the Cabaret Voltaire in Z\u00fcrich. Dada rejected reason and logic, prizing nonsense, irrationality, and intuition. The origin of the name Dada is unclear; some believe that it is a nonsense word. Others maintain that it originates from the Romanian artists Tristan Tzara and Marcel Janco's frequent use of the words da, da, meaning yes, yes in the Romanian language. Another theory says that the name \"Dada\" came during a meeting of the group when a paper knife stuck into a French-German dictionary happened to point to \"dada\", a French word for \"hobbyhorse\".\nThe movement primarily involved visual arts, literature, poetry, art manifestoes, art theory, theatre, and graphic design, and concentrated its anti-war politics through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through anti-art cultural works. In addition to being anti-war, Dada was also anti-bourgeois and had political affinities with the radical left.\nDada activities included public gatherings, demonstrations, and publication of art/literary journals; passionate coverage of art, politics, and culture were topics often discussed in a variety of media. Key figures in the movement, apart from Duchamp, included: Hugo Ball, Emmy Hennings, Hans Arp, Raoul Hausmann, Hannah H\u00f6ch, Johannes Baader, Tristan Tzara, Francis Picabia, Richard Huelsenbeck, Georg Grosz, John Heartfield, Beatrice Wood, Kurt Schwitters, and Hans Richter, among others. The movement influenced later styles, such as the avant-garde and downtown music movements, and groups including surrealism, Nouveau r\u00e9alisme, pop art, and Fluxus.\nDada is the groundwork to abstract art and sound poetry, a starting point for performance art, a prelude to postmodernism, an influence on pop art, a celebration of antiart to be later embraced for anarcho-political uses in the 1960s and the movement that lay the foundation for Surrealism.\nNew York Dada had a less serious tone than that of European Dadaism, and was not a particularly organized venture. Duchamp's friend Francis Picabia connected with the Dada group in Z\u00fcrich, bringing to New York the Dadaist ideas of absurdity and \"anti-art\". Duchamp and Picabia first met in September 1911 at the Salon d'Automne in Paris, where they were both exhibiting. Duchamp showed a larger version of his \"Young Man and Girl in Spring\" 1911, a work that had an Edenic theme and a thinly veiled sexuality also found in Picabia's contemporaneous \"Adam and Eve\" 1911. According to Duchamp, \"our friendship began right there\". A group met almost nightly at the Arensberg home, or caroused in Greenwich Village. Together with Man Ray, Duchamp contributed his ideas and humor to the New York activities, many of which ran concurrent with the development of his Readymades and \"The Large Glass\".\nThe most prominent example of Duchamp's association with Dada was his submission of \"Fountain\", a urinal, to the Society of Independent Artists exhibit in 1917. Artworks in the Independent Artists shows were not selected by jury, and all pieces submitted were displayed. However, the show committee insisted that \"Fountain\" was not art, and rejected it from the show. This caused an uproar among the Dadaists, and led Duchamp to resign from the board of the Independent Artists.\nAlong with Henri-Pierre Roch\u00e9 and Beatrice Wood, Duchamp published multiple Dada magazines in New York\u2014including \"The Blind Man\" and \"Rongwrong\"\u2014which included art, literature, humor and commentary.\nWhen he returned to Paris after World War I, Duchamp did not participate in the Dada group.\nReadymades.\n\"Readymades\" were found objects which Duchamp chose and presented as art. In 1913, Duchamp installed a \"Bicycle Wheel\" in his studio. The Bicycle Wheel was an idea of Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven. However, the idea of \"Readymades\" did not fully develop until 1915. The idea was to question the very notion of Art, and the adoration of art, which Duchamp found \"unnecessary\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;My idea was to choose an object that wouldn't attract me, either by its beauty or by its ugliness. To find a point of indifference in my looking at it, you see.\n\"Bottle Rack\" (1914), a bottle-drying rack signed by Duchamp, is considered to be the first \"pure\" readymade. \"In Advance of the Broken Arm\" (1915), a snow shovel, also called \"Prelude to a Broken Arm\", followed soon after. His \"Fountain\", a urinal signed with the pseudonym \"R. Mutt\", shocked the art world in 1917. \"Fountain\" was selected in 2004 as \"the most influential artwork of the 20th century\" by 500 renowned artists and historians.\nIn 1919, Duchamp made a parody of the \"Mona Lisa\" by adorning a cheap reproduction of the painting with a mustache and goatee. To this he added the inscription \"L.H.O.O.Q.\", a phonetic game which, when read out loud in French quickly sounds like \"Elle a chaud au cul\". This can be translated as \"She has a hot ass\", implying that the woman in the painting is in a state of sexual excitement and availability. It may also have been intended as a Freudian joke, referring to Leonardo da Vinci's alleged homosexuality. Duchamp gave a \"loose\" translation of L.H.O.O.Q. as \"there is fire down below\" in a late interview with Arturo Schwarz. According to Rhonda Roland Shearer, the apparent \"Mona Lisa\" reproduction is in fact a copy modeled partly on Duchamp's own face. Research published by Shearer also speculates that Duchamp himself may have created some of the objects which he claimed to be \"found objects\".\nAntecedent.\nIn 2017\u20132018, the French expert Johann Naldi found and identified seventeen unpublished works in a private collection, classified as a national treasure on May 7, 2021 by the French Ministry of Culture, including \"Des souteneurs encore dans la force de l'\u00e2ge et le ventre dans l'herbe\" by Alphonse Allais\",\" consisting of a green carriage curtain suspended from a wooden cylinder. This work was certainly exhibited at the Incoherents exhibitions in Paris between 1883 and 1893. According to Johann Naldi, this work is the oldest known readymade and was a source of inspiration for Marcel Duchamp.\n\"The Large Glass\".\nDuchamp worked on his complex Futurism-inspired piece \"The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even (The Large Glass)\" from 1915 to 1923, except for periods in Buenos Aires and Paris in 1918\u20131920. He executed the work on two panes of glass with materials such as lead foil, fuse wire, and dust. It combines chance procedures, plotted perspective studies, and laborious craftsmanship. He published notes for the piece, \"The Green Box\", intended to complement the visual experience. They reflect the creation of unique rules of physics, and a mythology which describes the work. He stated that his \"hilarious picture\" is intended to depict the erotic encounter between a bride and her nine bachelors.\nA performance of the stage adaptation of Raymond Roussel's novel \"Impressions d'Afrique\", which Duchamp attended in 1912, inspired the piece. Notes, sketches and plans for the work were drawn on his studio walls as early as 1913. To concentrate on the work free from material obligations, Duchamp found work as a librarian while living in France. After immigrating to the United States in 1915, he began work on the piece, financed by the support of the Arensbergs.\nThe piece is partly constructed as a retrospective of Duchamp's works, including a three-dimensional reproduction of his earlier paintings \"Bride\" (1912), \"Chocolate Grinder\" (1914) and \"Glider containing a water mill in neighboring metals\" (1913\u20131915), which has led to numerous interpretations. The work was formally declared \"Unfinished\" in 1923. Returning from its first public exhibition in a shipping crate, the glass suffered a large crack. Duchamp repaired it, but left the smaller cracks in the glass intact, accepting the chance element as a part of the piece.\nJoseph Nechvatal has cast a considerable light on \"The Large Glass\" by noting the autoerotic implications of both bachelorhood and the repetitive, frenetic machine; he then discerns a larger constellation of themes by insinuating that autoeroticsm \u2013 and with the machine as omnipresent partner and practitioner \u2013 opens out into a subversive pan-sexuality as expressed elsewhere in Duchamp's work and career, in that a trance-inducing pleasure becomes the operative principle as opposed to the dictates of the traditional male-female coupling; and he as well documents the existence of this theme cluster throughout modernism, starting with Rodin's controversial Monument to Balzac, and culminating in a Duchampian vision of a techno-universe in which one and all can find themselves welcomed.\nUntil 1969 when the Philadelphia Museum of Art revealed Duchamp's \"\u00c9tant donn\u00e9s\" tableau, \"The Large Glass\" was thought to have been his last major work.\nKinetic works.\nDuchamp's interest in kinetic art works can be discerned as early as the notes for \"The Large Glass\" and the \"Bicycle Wheel\" readymade, and despite losing interest in \"retinal art\", he retained interest in visual phenomena. In 1920, with help from Man Ray, Duchamp built a motorized sculpture, \"Rotative plaques verre, optique de pr\u00e9cision\" (\"Rotary Glass Plates, Precision Optics\"). The piece, which he did not consider to be art, involved a motor to spin pieces of rectangular glass on which were painted segments of a circle. When the apparatus spins, an optical illusion occurs, where the segments appear to be closed concentric circles. Man Ray set up equipment to photograph the initial experiment, but when they turned the machine for the second time, a drive belt broke and caught a piece of the glass, which after glancing off Man Ray's head, shattered into bits.\nAfter moving back to Paris in 1923, at Andr\u00e9 Breton's urging, with financing by Jacques Doucet, Duchamp built another optical device based on the first one, \"Rotative Demisph\u00e8re, optique de pr\u00e9cision\" (Rotary Demisphere, Precision Optics). This time the optical element was a globe cut in half, with black concentric circles painted on it. When it spins, the circles appear to move backward and forward in space. Duchamp asked that Doucet not exhibit the apparatus as art.\n\"Rotoreliefs\" were the next phase of Duchamp's spinning works. To make the optical \"play toys\", he painted designs on flat cardboard circles and spun them on a phonographic turntable. When spinning, the flat disks appeared three-dimensional. He had a printer produce 500 sets of six of the designs, and set up a booth at a 1935 Paris inventors' show to sell them. The venture was a financial disaster, but some optical scientists thought they might be of use in restoring three-dimensional stereoscopic sight to people who have lost vision in one eye. In collaboration with Man Ray and Marc All\u00e9gret, Duchamp filmed early versions of the \"Rotoreliefs\", and they named the film \"An\u00e9mic Cin\u00e9ma\" (1926). Later, in Alexander Calder's studio in 1931, while looking at the sculptor's kinetic works, Duchamp suggested that these should be called \"mobiles\". Calder agreed to use this novel term in his upcoming show. To this day, sculptures of this type are called \"mobiles\".\nMusical ideas.\nBetween 1912 and 1915, Duchamp worked with various musical ideas. At least three pieces have survived: two compositions and a note for a musical happening. The two compositions are based on chance operations. \"Erratum Musical\", written for three voices, was published in 1934. \"La Mari\u00e9e mise \u00e0 nu par ses c\u00e9libataires m\u00eame. Erratum Musical\" is unfinished and was never published or exhibited during Duchamp's lifetime. According to the manuscript, the piece was intended for a mechanical instrument \"in which the virtuoso intermediary is suppressed\". The manuscript also contains a description for \"An apparatus automatically recording fragmented musical periods,\" consisting of a funnel, several open-end cars and a set of numbered balls. These pieces predate John Cage's \"Music of Changes\" (1951), which is often considered the first modern piece to be conceived largely through random procedures.\nIn 1968, Duchamp and John Cage appeared together at a concert entitled \"Reunion\", playing a game of chess and composing Aleatoric music by triggering a series of photoelectric cells underneath the chessboard.\nRrose S\u00e9lavy.\n\"Rrose S\u00e9lavy\", also spelled Rose S\u00e9lavy, was one of Duchamp's pseudonyms. The name, a pun, sounds like the French phrase , which may be translated as \"Eros, such is life.\" It has also been read as (\"to make a toast to life\"). S\u00e9lavy emerged in 1921 in a series of photographs by Man Ray showing Duchamp dressed as a woman. Through the 1920s Man Ray and Duchamp collaborated on more photos of S\u00e9lavy. Duchamp later used the name as the byline on written material and signed several creations with it.\nDuchamp used the name in the title of at least one sculpture, \"Why Not Sneeze Rose S\u00e9lavy?\" (1921). The sculpture, a type of readymade called an assemblage, consists of an oral thermometer, a couple of dozen small cubes of marble resembling sugar cubes and a cuttlefish bone inside a birdcage. S\u00e9lavy also appears on the label of \"Belle Haleine, Eau de Voilette\" (1921), a readymade that is a perfume bottle in the original box. Duchamp also signed his film \"An\u00e9mic Cin\u00e9ma\" (1926) with the S\u00e9lavy name.\nThe inspiration for the name Rrose S\u00e9lavy has been thought to be Belle da Costa Greene, J. P. Morgan's librarian at The Morgan Library &amp; Museum (formerly The Pierpont Morgan Library) who, following his death, became the Library's director, working there for a total of forty-three years.

Morgan, and then by his son Jack, Greene built the collection buying and selling rare manuscripts, books and art.\nRrose S\u00e9lavy, and the other pseudonyms Duchamp used, may be read as a comment on the fallacy of romanticizing the conscious individuality or subjectivity of the artist, a theme that is also a prominent subtext of the readymades. Duchamp said in an interview, \"You think you're doing something entirely your own, and a year later you look at it and you see actually the roots of where your art comes from without your knowing it at all.\" The P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami, in Florida, holds the piece \"Bo\u00eete-en-valise (De ou par Marcel Duchamp ou Rrose S\u00e9lavy),\" or in English, \"Box in a Valise (From or by Marcel Duchamp or Rrose S\u00e9lavy)\" created from 1941\u201361, in the museum's collection. \nFrom 1922, the name Rrose S\u00e9lavy also started appearing in a series of aphorisms, puns, and spoonerisms by the French surrealist poet Robert Desnos. Desnos tried to portray Rrose S\u00e9lavy as a long-lost aristocrat and rightful queen of France. Aphorism 13 paid homage to Marcel Duchamp: \u2012 in English: \"Rrose S\u00e9lavy knows the merchant of salt well\"; in French the final words sound like Mar-champ Du-cel. Note that the \"salt seller\" aphorism \u2013 \"mar-chand-du-sel\" \u2013 is a phonetic anagram of the artist's name: \"mar-cel-du-champ\". (Duchamp's compiled notes are entitled, \"Salt Seller\".) In 1939 a collection of these aphorisms was published under the name of Rrose S\u00e9lavy, entitled, .\nTransition from art to chess.\nIn 1918, Duchamp took leave of the New York art scene, interrupting his work on the \"Large Glass\", and went to Buenos Aires, where he remained for nine months and often played chess. He carved his own chess set from wood with help from a local craftsman who made the knights. He moved to Paris in 1919, and then back to the United States in 1920. Upon his return to Paris in 1923, Duchamp was, in essence, no longer a practicing artist. Instead, his main interest was chess, which he studied for the rest of his life to the exclusion of most other activities.\nDuchamp is seen, briefly, playing chess with Man Ray in the short film \"Entr'acte\" (1924) by Ren\u00e9 Clair. He designed the 1925 poster for the Third French Chess Championship, and as a competitor in the event, finished at fifty percent (3\u20133, with two draws), earning the title of chess master. During this period his fascination with chess so distressed his first wife that she glued his pieces to the chessboard. Duchamp continued to play in the French Championships and in the Chess Olympiads from 1928 to 1933, favoring hypermodern openings such as the Nimzo-Indian.\nSometime in the early 1930s, Duchamp reached the height of his ability, but realized that he had little chance of winning recognition in top-level chess. In the following years, his participation in chess tournaments declined, but he discovered correspondence chess and became a chess journalist, writing weekly newspaper columns. While his contemporaries were achieving spectacular success in the art world by selling their works to high-society collectors, Duchamp observed, \"I am still a victim of chess. It has all the beauty of art\u2014and much more. It cannot be commercialized. Chess is much purer than art in its social position.\" On another occasion, Duchamp elaborated, \"The chess pieces are the block alphabet which shapes thoughts; and these thoughts, although making a visual design on the chess-board, express their beauty abstractly, like a poem. ... I have come to the personal conclusion that while all artists are not chess players, all chess players are artists.\"\nIn 1932, Duchamp teamed with chess theorist Vitaly Halberstadt to publish \"L'opposition et cases conjugu\u00e9es sont r\u00e9concili\u00e9es\" (Opposition and Sister Squares are Reconciled), known as corresponding squares. This treatise describes the Lasker-Reichhelm position, an extremely rare type of position that can arise in the endgame. Using enneagram-like charts that fold upon themselves, the authors demonstrated that in this position, the most Black can hope for is a draw.\nThe theme of the \"endgame\" is important to an understanding of Duchamp's complex attitude toward his artistic career. Irish playwright Samuel Beckett was an associate of Duchamp, and used the theme as the narrative device for the 1957 play of the same name, \"Endgame\". In 1968, Duchamp played an artistically important chess match with avant-garde composer John Cage, at a concert entitled \"Reunion\". Music was produced by a series of photoelectric cells underneath the chessboard, triggered sporadically by normal game play.\nOn choosing a career in chess, Duchamp said, \"If Bobby Fischer came to me for advice, I certainly would not discourage him\u2014as if anyone could\u2014but I would try to make it positively clear that he will never have any money from chess, live a monk-like existence and know more rejection than any artist ever has, struggling to be known and accepted.\"\nDuchamp left a legacy to chess in the form of an enigmatic endgame problem he composed in 1943. The problem was included in the announcement for Julian Levi's gallery exhibition \"Through the Big End of the Opera Glass\", printed on translucent paper with the faint inscription: \"White to play and win\". Grandmasters and endgame specialists have since grappled with the problem, with most concluding that there is no solution.\nLater artistic involvement.\nAlthough Duchamp was no longer considered to be an active artist, he continued to consult with artists, art dealers and collectors. From 1925 he often traveled between France and the United States, and made New York's Greenwich Village his home in 1942. He also occasionally worked on artistic projects such as the short film \"An\u00e9mic Cin\u00e9ma\" (1926), \"Box in a Valise\" (1935\u20131941), \"Self Portrait in Profile\" (1958) and the larger work \"\u00c9tant Donn\u00e9s\" (1946\u20131966). In 1943, he participated with Maya Deren in her unfinished film \"The Witch's Cradle\", filmed in Peggy Guggenheim's Art of This Century gallery, in which his hands manipulate the string game, Cat's Cradle, while his body is enmeshed in stop-motion-animated twine.\nFrom the mid-1930s onward he collaborated with the Surrealists; however, he did not join the movement, despite the coaxing of Andr\u00e9 Breton. From then until 1944, together with Max Ernst, Eugenio Granell, and Breton, Duchamp edited the Surrealist periodical \"VVV\", and served as an advisory editor for the magazine \"View\", which featured him in its March 1945 edition, thus introducing him to a broader American audience.\nDuchamp's influence on the art world remained behind the scenes until the late 1950s, when he was \"discovered\" by young artists such as Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, who were eager to escape the dominance of Abstract Expressionism. In 1959, the publication in both French and English of Robert Lebel's catalogue raisonn\u00e9 made his work more widely accessible. He was a co-founder of the international literary group Oulipo in 1960. Interest in Duchamp was reignited in the 1960s, and he gained international public recognition. In 1963, curator Walter Hopps organized Duchamp's first retrospective exhibition at the Pasadena Art Museum, and there he appeared in an iconic photograph playing chess opposite nude model Eve Babitz, photographed by Julian Wasser. The photograph was later described by the Smithsonian Archives of American Art as being \"among the key documentary images of American modern art\".\nArtist and collaborator Richard Hamilton (artist) organized a retrospective at The Tate Gallery in 1966. Other major institutions, including the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art, New York, followed with a retrospective of Duchamp's work in 1973. He was invited to lecture on art and to participate in formal discussions, as well as sitting for interviews with major publications. As the last surviving member of the Duchamp family of artists, in 1967 Duchamp helped to organize an exhibition in Rouen, France, called \"Les Duchamp: Jacques Villon, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Marcel Duchamp, Suzanne Duchamp\". Parts of this family exhibition were later shown again at the Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne in Paris.\nExhibition design and installation art.\nDuchamp participated in the design of the 1938 Exposition Internationale du Surr\u00e9alisme, held at the Galerie des Beaux-arts, Paris. The show was organised by Andr\u00e9 Breton and Paul \u00c9luard, and featured \"Two hundred and twenty-nine artworks by sixty exhibitors from fourteen countries... at this multimedia exhibition.\" The Surrealists wanted to create an exhibition which in itself would be a creative act, thus working collaboratively in its staging. Marcel Duchamp was named as \"Generateur-arbitre\", Salvador Dal\u00ed and Max Ernst were listed as technical directors, Man Ray was chief lighting technician and Wolfgang Paalen responsible for \"water and foliage\".\n\"Plus belles rues de Paris\" (The most beautiful streets of Paris) filled one side of the lobby with mannequins dressed by various Surrealists. The main hall, or the \"Salle de Superstition\" (Room of Superstition), was \"a cave-like Gesamtkunstwerk\" notably including Duchamp's installation, \"Twelve Hundred Coal Bags Suspended from the Ceiling over a Stove\", which was literally 1,200 stuffed coal bags suspended from the ceiling. The floor was covered by Paalen with dead leaves and mud from the Montparnasse Cemetery. In the middle of the grand hall underneath Duchamp's coal sacks, Paalen installed an artificial water-filled pond with real water lilies and reeds, which he called \"Avant La Mare\". A single light bulb provided the only illumination, so patrons were given flashlights with which to view the art (an idea of Man Ray), while the aroma of roasting coffee filled the air. Around midnight, the visitors witnessed the dancing shimmer of a scantily dressed girl who suddenly arose from the reeds, jumped on a bed, shrieked hysterically, then disappeared just as quickly. Much to the Surrealists' satisfaction, the exhibition scandalized many of the guests.\nIn 1942, for the \"First Papers of Surrealism\" show in New York, surrealists called on Duchamp to design the exhibition. He created an installation, \"His Twine\", commonly known as the \"mile of string\", it was a three-dimensional web of string throughout the rooms of the space, in some cases making it almost impossible to see the works. Duchamp made a secret arrangement with an associate's son to bring young friends to the opening of the show. When the formally-dressed patrons arrived, they found a dozen children in athletic clothes kicking and passing balls, and skipping rope. When questioned, the children were told to say \"Mr. Duchamp told us we could play here\". Duchamp's design of the catalog for the show included \"found\", rather than posed, photographs of the artists.\nBreton with Duchamp organized the exhibition \"Le surr\u00e9alisme en 1947\" in the Galerie Maeght in Paris after the war and named set designer Frederick Kiesler as architect.\n\"\u00c9tant donn\u00e9s\".\nDuchamp's final major art work surprised the art world, which believed he had given up art for chess 25 years earlier. Entitled \"\u00c9tant donn\u00e9s: 1\u00b0 la chute d'eau / 2\u00b0 le gaz d'\u00e9clairage\" (\"Given: 1. The Waterfall, 2. The Illuminating Gas\"), it is a tableau, visible only through a peep hole in a wooden door. A nude woman may be seen lying on her back with her face hidden, legs spread, and one hand holding a gas lamp in the air against a landscape backdrop. Duchamp had worked secretly on the piece from 1946 to 1966 in his Greenwich Village studio while even his closest friends thought he had abandoned art. The torso of the nude figure is based on Duchamp's lover, the Brazilian sculptor Maria Martins, with whom he had an affair from 1946 to 1951.\nPersonal life.\nThroughout his adult life, Duchamp was a passionate smoker of Habana cigars.\nDuchamp became a United States citizen in 1955.\nIn June 1927, Duchamp married Lydie Sarazin-Levassor; however, they divorced six months later. It was rumored that Duchamp had chosen a marriage of convenience, because Sarazin-Levassor was the daughter of a wealthy automobile manufacturer. Early in January 1928, Duchamp said that he could no longer bear the responsibility and confinement of marriage, and they were soon divorced.\nBetween 1946 and 1951 Maria Martins was his mistress.\nIn 1954, he and Alexina \"Teeny\" Sattler married. They remained together until his death.\nDuchamp was an atheist.\nDeath and burial.\nDuchamp died suddenly and peacefully in the early morning of 2 October 1968 at his home in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France. After an evening dining at home with his friends Man Ray and Robert Lebel, Duchamp retired at 1:05\u00a0am, collapsed in his studio, and died of heart failure.\nHe is buried in the Rouen Cemetery, in Rouen, France, with the epitaph, \"D'ailleurs, c'est toujours les autres qui meurent\" (\"Besides, it's always the others who die\").\nLegacy.\nMany critics consider Duchamp to be one of the most important artists of the 20th century, and his output influenced the development of post\u2013World War I Western art. He advised modern art collectors, such as Peggy Guggenheim and other prominent figures, thereby helping to shape the tastes of Western art during this period. He challenged conventional thought about artistic processes and rejected the emerging art market, through subversive anti-art. He famously dubbed a urinal art and named it \"Fountain\". Duchamp produced relatively few artworks and remained mostly aloof of the avant-garde circles of his time. He went on to pretend to abandon art and devote the rest of his life to chess, while secretly continuing to make art. In 1958 Duchamp said of creativity,\nThe creative act is not performed by the artist alone; the spectator brings the work in contact with the external world by deciphering and interpreting its inner qualifications and thus adds his contribution to the creative act.\nDuchamp in his later life explicitly expressed negativity toward art. In a BBC interview with Duchamp conducted by Joan Bakewell in 1968 he compared art with religion, saying that he wished to do away with art the same way many have done away with religion. Duchamp goes on to explain to the interviewer that \"the word art etymologically means to do\", that art means activity of any kind, and that it is our society that creates \"purely artificial\" distinctions of being an artist.\nA quotation erroneously attributed to Duchamp suggests a negative attitude toward later trends in 20th century art:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This Neo-Dada, which they call New Realism, Pop Art, Assemblage, etc., is an easy way out, and lives on what Dada did. When I discovered the ready-mades I sought to discourage aesthetics. In Neo-Dada they have taken my readymades and found aesthetic beauty in them, I threw the bottle-rack and the urinal into their faces as a challenge and now they admire them for their aesthetic beauty.\nHowever, this was written in 1961 by fellow Dadaist Hans Richter, in the second person, i.e. \"You threw the bottle-rack...\". Although a marginal note in the letter suggests that Duchamp generally approved of the statement, Richter did not make the distinction clear until many years later.\nDuchamp's attitude was more favorable, however, as evidenced by another statement made in 1964:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Pop Art is a return to \"conceptual\" painting, virtually abandoned, except by the Surrealists, since [Gustave] Courbet, in favor of retinal painting... If you take a Campbell soup can and repeat it 50 times, you are not interested in the retinal image. What interests you is the concept that wants to put 50 Campbell soup cans on a canvas.\nThe Prix Marcel Duchamp (Marcel Duchamp Prize), established in 2000, is an annual award given to a young artist by the Centre Georges Pompidou. In 2004, as a testimony to the legacy of Duchamp's work to the art world, a panel of prominent artists and art historians voted \"Fountain\" \"the most influential artwork of the 20th century\". In his 2025 art history book \"Shock Factory: The Visual Culture of Industrial Music\", Nicolas Ballet points out Duchamp's explicit influence on Industrial Music.\nAn open\u2011access, interdisciplinary online journal dedicated to the study of Marcel Duchamp and his circle, called Tout\u2011Fait: The Marcel Duchamp Studies Online Journal (stylized \"Tout\u2011Fait\") was launched in 1999 and is published by CyberBOOK+ Publications, the digital publishing arm of the New York\u2013based nonprofit Art Science Research Laboratory (ASRL). The journal, which is free-of-charge, publishes peer-reviewed research articles, news features, interviews, notes, and multimedia related to Duchamp's work and influence, often emphasizing connections between art, science, and media studies.\nArt market.\nOn 17 November 1999, a version of \"Fountain\" (owned by the critic and gallerist Arturo Schwarz) was sold at Sotheby's, New York, for $1,762,500 to Dimitris Daskalopoulos, who declared that \"Fountain\" represented the origin of contemporary art. The price set a world record, at the time, for a work by Marcel Duchamp at public auction. The record has since been surpassed by a work sold at Christie's Paris, titled \"Belle Haleine, Eau de Voilette\" (1921). The readymade of a perfume bottle in its box sold for a record $11.5\u00a0million (\u20ac8.9\u00a0million).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nDuchamp works\nEssays by Duchamp\nGeneral resources\nAudio and video\nChess"}

It administers the nation's 154 national forests and 20 national grasslands covering of land. The major divisions of the agency are the Chief's Office, National Forest System, State and Private Forestry, Business Operations, as well as Research and Development. The agency manages about 25% of federal lands and is the sole major national land management agency not part of the U.S. Department of the Interior (which manages the National Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Land Management).\nHistory.\nIn 1876, Congress formed the office of Special Agent in the Department of Agriculture to assess the quality and conditions of forests in the United States. Franklin B. Hough was appointed the head of the office. In 1881, the office was expanded into the newly formed Division of Forestry. The Forest Reserve Act of 1891 authorized withdrawing land from the public domain as forest reserves managed by the Department of the Interior. In 1901, the Division of Forestry was renamed the Bureau of Forestry.\nThe Transfer Act of 1905 transferred the management of forest reserves from the United States General Land Office of the Interior Department to the Bureau of Forestry, henceforth known as the United States Forest Service. Gifford Pinchot was the first United States Chief Forester in the Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt.\nA historical note to include is that the National Park Service was created in 1916 to manage Yellowstone and several other parks; in 1956, the Fish and Wildlife Service became the manager of lands reserved for wildlife. The Grazing Service and the United States General Land Office were combined to create the Bureau of Land Management in 1946. Also of note was that it was not until 1976 that the Federal Land Policy and Management Act became the national policy for retaining public land for federal ownership.\nSignificant federal legislation affecting the Forest Service includes the Weeks Act of 1911, the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934, P.L. 73-482; the Multiple Use \u2013 Sustained Yield Act of 1960, P.L. 86-517; the Wilderness Act, P.L. 88-577; the National Forest Management Act, P.L. 94-588; the National Environmental Policy Act, P.L. 91\u2013190; the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act, P.L. 95-313; and the Forest and Rangelands Renewable Resources Planning Act, P.L. 95-307.\nFrom the early 1900s to the present, there has been a fierce rivalry over control of forests between the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior. Their roles overlap but numerous proposals to combine the two have failed. Most recently, in 2009, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) evaluated whether the Forest Service should be moved from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of the Interior, which already manages some of public land through the National Park Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Land Management. GAO ultimately did not offer a recommendation upon the conclusion of its performance audit. The Forest Service remains a part of the USDA.\nOrganization.\nOverview.\nAs of 2019, FY 2020 Forest Service total budget authority is $5.14\u00a0billion, a decrease of $815\u00a0million from 2019. The budget includes $2.4\u00a0billion for Wildland Fire Management, a decrease of $530\u00a0million from the 2019 Annualized Continuing Resolution because the \"fire fix\" cap adjustment becomes available in FY 2020, while the FY 2019 Annualized Continuing Resolution includes $500\u00a0million above the base as bridge to the first year of the fire fix.\nThe Forest Service, headquartered in Washington, D.C., has 27,062 permanent, full-time employees as of Sept. 20, 2018, including 541 in the headquarters office and 26,521 in regional and field office.\nThe USDA Forest Service's mission is to sustain the health, diversity, and productivity of the Nation's forests and grasslands to meet the needs of present and future generations. Its motto is \"Caring for the land and serving people.\"\nAs the lead federal agency in natural resource conservation, the Forest Service provides leadership in the protection, management, and use of the nation's forest, rangeland, and aquatic ecosystems. The agency's ecosystem approach to management integrates ecological, economic, and social factors to maintain and enhance the quality of the environment to meet current and future needs. Through implementation of land and resource management plans, the agency ensures sustainable ecosystems by restoring and maintaining species diversity and ecological productivity that helps provide recreation, water, timber, minerals, fish, wildlife, wilderness, and aesthetic values for current and future generations of people.\nThe everyday work of the Forest Service balances resource extraction, resource protection, and providing recreation. The work includes managing of national forest and grasslands, including of roadless areas; 14,077 recreation sites; of trails; of roads; and the harvesting of 1.5\u00a0billion trees per year. Further, the Forest Service fought fires on of land in 2007.\nThe Forest Service organization includes ranger districts, national forests, regions, research stations and research work units and the Northeastern Area Office for State and Private Forestry. Each level has responsibility for a variety of functions.\nNational Places.\nThe Chief of the Forest Service is a career federal employee who oversees the agency. The Chief reports to the Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, an appointee of the President confirmed by the Senate. The Chief's staff provides broad policy and direction for the agency, works with the Administration to develop a budget to submit to Congress, provides information to Congress on accomplishments, and monitors activities of the agency. There are five deputy chiefs for the following areas: National Forest System, State and Private Forestry, Research and Development, Business Operations, and Finance.\nResearch stations and research work units.\nThe Forest Service Research and Development deputy area includes five research stations, the Forest Products Laboratory, and the International Institute of Tropical Forestry, in Puerto Rico. Station directors, like regional foresters, report to the Chief. Research stations include Northern, Pacific Northwest, Pacific Southwest, Rocky Mountain, and Southern. There are 92 research work units located at 67 sites throughout the United States. there are 80 Experimental Forests and Ranges that have been established progressively since 1908; many sites are more than 50 years old. The system provides places for long-term science and management studies in major vegetation types of the of public land administered by the Forest Service. Individual sites range from 47 to 22,500\u00a0ha in size.\nOperations of Experimental Forests and Ranges are directed by local research teams for the individual sites, by Research Stations for the regions in which they are located, and at the level of the Forest Service.\nMajor themes in research at the Experimental Forests and Ranges includes:\ndevelop of systems for managing and restoring forests, range lands, and watersheds; investigate the workings of forest and stream ecosystems; characterize plant and animal communities; observe and interpret long-term environmental change and many other themes.\nRegions.\nThere are nine regions in the Forest Service; numbered 1 through 10 (Region 7 was eliminated\nin 1965 when the current Eastern Region was created from the former Eastern and\nNorth Central regions.\n). Each encompasses a broad geographic area and is headed by a regional forester who reports directly to the Chief. The regional forester has broad responsibility for coordinating activities among the various forests within the region, for providing overall leadership for regional natural resource and social programs, and for coordinated regional land use planning.\nNational Forest or Grassland.\nThe Forest Service oversees 155 national forests, 20 grasslands, and one tall-grass prairie. Each administrative unit typically comprises several ranger districts, under the overall direction of a forest supervisor. Within the supervisor's office, the staff coordinates activities among districts, allocates the budget, and provides technical support to each district. Forest supervisors are line officers and report to regional foresters.\nRanger District.\nThe administration of individual National Forests is subdivided into Ranger Districts. The Forest Service has over 600 ranger districts. Each district has a staff of 10 to 300 people under the direction of a district ranger, a line officer who reports to a forest supervisor. The districts vary in size from to more than . Most on-the-ground activities occur on ranger districts, including trail construction and maintenance, operation of campgrounds, oversight of a wide variety of special use permitted activities, management of vegetation and wildlife habitat, and cultural resource management.\nMajor divisions.\nNational Forest System.\nThe of public land that are managed as national forests and grasslands are collectively known as the National Forest System. These lands are located in 44 states, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands and comprise about 9% of the total land area in the United States. The lands are organized into 155 national forests and 20 national grasslands. The mission of the National Forest System is to protect and manage the forest lands so they best demonstrate the sustainable multiple-use management concept, using an ecological approach, to meet the diverse needs of people.\nWildfire management and suppression is a significant subdivision of the National Forest System. Wildfire suppression and prevention programs comprise nearly 50% of the Forest Service\u2019s overall budget and, during the peak fire season, it employs approximately 10,000-15,000 wildland firefighters. Wildland firefighters are often deployed on an interagency basis alongside firefighters from other federal and state land management agencies often with support from local and county structure fire departments. Additionally, Forest Service employees who are not normally full time firefighters are regularly called upon to respond to wildfire incidents in administrative, support, security, and even direct firefighting roles. For both primary fire and supplementary employees, fire assignments usually last 2\u20133 weeks at a time for each individual employee during which they typically work 16 hours on and eight hours off while sleeping in tents. After an assignment ends, the employee is granted three days of R&amp;R before either returning to their day job or going on another assignment.\nLaw Enforcement &amp; Investigations.\nU.S. Forest Service Law Enforcement &amp; Investigations (LEI), headquartered in Washington, D.C., is a federal law enforcement agency of the U.S. government. It is responsible for enforcement of federal laws and regulations governing national forest lands and resources. All law enforcement officers and special agents receive their training through Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC).\nOperations are divided into two major functional areas:\nUniformed Law Enforcement Officers (LEOs) enforce federal laws and regulations governing national forest lands and resources. LEOs also enforce some or all state laws on National Forest Lands. As part of that mission, LEOs carry firearms, defensive equipment, make arrests, execute search warrants, complete reports, and testify in court. They establish a regular and recurring presence on a vast amount of public lands, roads, and recreation sites. The primary focus of their jobs is the protection of natural resources, protection of Forest Service employees and the protection of visitors. To cover the vast and varied terrain under their jurisdiction, they use modified 4x4 pickup trucks, Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptors, special service SUVs, horses, K-9 units, helicopters, snowmobiles, ATVs, ROVs, dirt bikes, and boats.\nSpecial Agents are criminal investigators who plan and conduct investigations concerning possible violations of criminal and administrative provisions of the Forest Service and other statutes under the United States Code. Special agents are normally plainclothes officers who carry concealed firearms, and other defensive equipment, make arrests, carry out complex criminal investigations, present cases for prosecution to U.S. Attorneys, and prepare investigative reports. All field agents are required to travel a great deal and usually maintain a case load of ten to fifteen ongoing criminal investigations at one time. Criminal investigators also conduct internal and civil claim investigations. An example of the latter would be large scale wildfire liability cases in which the government is seeking civil restitution for major damage to National Forest Lands.\nAs of 2025, 8 special agents and 1 K9 of the LEI have been killed in the line of duty.\nLEI is also responsible for the oversight, training, and administration of the Forest Protection Officer (FPO) program. FPOs are unarmed, non-law enforcement, field going employees who have been granted the authority to enforce class B misdemeanors within Title 36, Part 261 of the Code of Federal Regulations (the day to day laws primarily governing the use of forests by the public). They do this by writing citations and mandatory federal court appearances. They must volunteer to become FPOs, pass an additional background check performed by LEI, and attend an initial training plus yearly recertification to maintain their authority. FPO is a \u201ccollateral duty\u201d one performs in addition to their primary job; because of this, the majority of FPOs are Recreation Technicians, Wilderness Rangers, or Fire Prevention Patrol Technicians, but the program is open to any field going employee who meets the requirements. Since they are unarmed and not LEOs, FPOs do not engage in enforcement contacts in situations that have a high probability for violence including those involving excessive alcohol intoxication, illegal substances, domestic disputes, assault, gang activity, etc instead disengaging and calling law enforcement immediately in such situations. \nState, Private and Tribal Forestry.\nThe goal of the State and Private Forestry program is to assist with financial and technical assistance to private landowners, state agencies, tribes, and community resource managers. It provides assistance by helping sustain the United States' urban and rural forests and their associated communities from wildland fires, insects, disease, and invasive organisms. Approximately 537 staff are employed in the program and is administered through National Forest System regions and the Northeastern Area of the United States.\nResearch and development.\nThe research and development (R&amp;D) arm of the Forest Service works to improve the health and use of the United States' forests and grasslands. Research has been part of the Forest Service mission since the agency's inception in 1905. Today, Forest Service researchers work in a range of biological, physical, and social science fields to promote sustainable management of United States' diverse forests and rangelands. Research employs about 550 scientists and several hundred technical and support staff, located at 67 sites throughout the United States and in Puerto Rico. Discovery and technology development and transfer is carried out through seven research stations.\nResearch focuses on informing policy and land management decisions and includes addressing invasive insects, degraded river ecosystems, or sustainable ways to harvest forest products. The researchers work independently and with a range of partners (formerly through a National Partnership Office), including other agencies, academia, nonprofit groups, and industry. The information and technology produced through basic and applied science programs is available to the public for its benefit and use.\nIn addition to the Research Stations, the USFS R&amp;D branch also leads several National Centers such as the National Genomics Center for Wildlife and Fish Conservation.\nInternational programs.\nThe Forest Service plays a key role in formulating policy and coordinating U.S. support for the protection and sound management of the world's forest resources. It works closely with other agencies such as USAID, the State Department, and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as with nonprofit development organizations, wildlife organizations, universities, and international assistance organizations. The Forest Service's international work serves to link people and communities striving to protect and manage forests throughout the world. The program also promotes sustainable land management overseas and brings important technologies and innovations back to the United States. The program focuses on conserving key natural resource in cooperation with countries across the world.\nResponses to environmental challenges.\nAlthough a large volume of timber is logged every year, not all National Forests are entirely forested. There are tidewater glaciers in the Tongass National Forest in Alaska and ski areas such as Alta, Utah in the Wasatch-Cache National Forest. In addition, the Forest Service is responsible for managing National Grasslands in the midwest. Furthermore, areas designated as wilderness by acts of Congress, prohibit logging, mining, road and building construction and land leases for purposes of farming and or livestock grazing.\nSince 1978, several Presidents have directed the USFS to administer National Monuments inside of preexisting National Forests.\nThe Forest Service also manages Grey Towers National Historic Site in Milford, Pennsylvania, the home and estate of its first Chief, Gifford Pinchot.\nFighting fires.\nBy 1935, the U.S. Forest Service's fire management policy stipulated that all wildfires were to be suppressed by 10 am the morning after they were first spotted.\nIn August 1944, to reduce the number of forest fires, the Forest Service and the Wartime Advertising Council began distributing fire education posters featuring a black bear. The poster campaign was a success; the black bear would later be named Smokey Bear, and would, for decades, be the \"spokesbear\" for the Forest Service. Smokey Bear has appeared in innumerable TV commercials; his popular catch phrase, \"Only YOU can prevent forest fires\"\u2014later changed to wildfires\u2014is one of the most widely recognized slogans in the United States. According to the Advertising Council, Smokey Bear is the most recognized icons in advertising history and has appeared almost everywhere via Public Service Announcements in print, radio, television. Smokey Bear, an icon protected by law, is jointly owned by the Forest Service, the Ad Council and the National Association of State Foresters.\nIn 1965, at the request of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Forest Service was commissioned by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) to research the use of forest fire as a military weapon. A report was published in June 1970 and declassified in May 1983.\nIn September 2000, the Departments of Agriculture and the Interior developed a plan to respond to the fires of 2000, to reduce the impacts of these wildland fires on rural communities, and to ensure sufficient firefighting resources in the future. The report is entitled \"Managing the Impacts of Wildfire on Communities and the Environment: A Report to the President In Response to the Wildfires of 2000\"\u2014The National Fire Plan for short. The National Fire Plan continues to be an integral part of the Forest Service today. The following are important operational features of the National Fire Plan:\nIn August 2014, Tom Vilsack, the Secretary of Agriculture, announced that the agency would have to put $400 to $500\u00a0million in wildfire prevention projects on hold because funding for firefighting was running low as the fiscal year ended. The decision was meant to preserve resources for fighting active fires burning in California, Oregon, Washington and Idaho. Politicians of both parties indicated they believed the then-current funding structure was broken, but did not agree on steps to fix the funding allocation.\nDuring the 2019\u20132020 bushfires in Australia, the US Forest Services sent a contingent of firefighters. They worked alongside firefighters from other American fire departments.\nClimate adaptation.\nIn April 2023, the U.S. Forest Service published a proposed rulemaking in response to climate change on the topic of improving climate resilience on the public lands that it manages. The agency introduced the need for such rulemaking as:\nClimate change and related stressors, such as wildfire, drought, insects and disease, extreme weather events, and chronic stress on ecosystems are resulting in increasing impacts with rapid and variable rates of change on national forests and grasslands. These impacts can be compounded by fire suppression, development in the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI), and non-climate informed timber harvest and reforestation practices.\nThe foundational question pertained to climate adaptation: \"How should the Forest Service adapt current policies and develop new policies and actions to conserve and manage the national forests and grasslands for climate resilience, so that the Agency can provide for ecological integrity and support social and economic sustainability over time?\" Ancillary questions pertained to both \"adaptation planning\" and \"adaptation practices\".\nThe background section of the proposed rulemaking includes a short history of how agency responsibilities have grown and evolved over its 118-year history in accordance with \"what the American people desire from their natural resources at any given point in time.\"\nCarbon capture and storage.\nIn the spring of 2023, the USDA proposed a change to its regulations to allow for the \"responsible deployment of\" carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration on National Forests lands.\nBudget.\nAlthough it is part of the Department of Agriculture, the Forest Service receives its budget through the Subcommittee on Appropriations\u2014Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies.\nPopular culture.\nThe Forest Service achieved widespread awareness during the 1960s, as it became the setting for the long running classic TV show \"Lassie\", with storylines focusing on Lassie's adventures with various forest rangers.\nThe iconic collie's association with the Forest Service led to Lassie receiving numerous awards and citations from the U.S. Senate and the Department of Agriculture, and was partly responsible for a bill regarding soil and water pollution that was signed into law in early 1968 by President Lyndon Johnson, which was dubbed by some as \"The Lassie Program\".\nIn the 2019 family comedy movie \"Playing With Fire\", John Cena plays a U.S. Forest Service firefighter who (along with his crew) watches over a group of rambunctious children while searching for their parents after rescuing them from a fire in the wilderness during a family vacation.\nControversies.\nThe history of the Forest Service has been fraught with controversy, as various interests and national values have grappled with the appropriate management of the many resources within the forests. These values and resources include grazing, timber, mining, recreation, wildlife habitat, and wilderness. Because of continuing development elsewhere, the large size of National Forests have made them \"de facto\" wildlife reserves for a number of rare and common species. In recent decades, the importance of mature forest for the spotted owl and a number of other species led to great changes in timber harvest levels.\nIn 1910, the first Chief of the Forest Service, Gifford Pinchot, was dismissed by President Taft as a result of the Pinchot-Ballinger controversy.\nIn the 1990s, the agency was involved in a scandal when it illegally provided surplus military aircraft to private contractors for use as airtankers in 1980s.\nThe policy on road building within the National Forests is another controversial issue. In 1999, President Clinton ordered a temporary moratorium on new road construction in the National Forests to \"assess their ecological, economic, and social values and to evaluate long-term options for their management.\" The Bush administration replaced this &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;5+1\u20442 years later, with a system where each state could petition the Forest Service to open forests in their territory to road building.\nIn 1997, the agency reported it was losing money on its timber sales.\nA 2017 draft report describing the legal basis which provides federal land managers a scope of decision making authority exceeding that of state fish and game departments has proven unexpectedly controversial.\nIn 2018, the Forest Service was reprimanded by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The Service had issued permits for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline to build through parts of the George Washington and Monongahela National Forests and a right of way across the Appalachian Trail \u2013 in violation of both the National Forest Management Act of 1976 and the National Environmental Policy Act.\nIn 2020, Melody Starya Mobley, the first black female forester hired by the Forest Service, claimed she had been sexually assaulted by a colleague in the late 70s, citing misogyny and racism within the institution as reasons why she did not speak up at the time. She also stated that though there was a witness present, her assault was largely ignored when she disclosed it to the agency and the perpetrator was never punished.\nA wave of mass layoffs by the Trump administration in early 2025\u2014following shortly after the extreme Southern California wildfires of January\u2014failed to account for the need to prepare workers for the fire season ahead; in dismissing probationary employees, not only did the administration disregard the fact that many affected staff actually had valuable years of experience with the agency (and were simply in current positions new to them), it severely weakened the efficiency of seasonal workflows necessary to mitigate the destructive potential of upcoming wildfires.\nNotable members.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "42653", "revid": "44217690", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42653", "title": "National forest (United States)", "text": "Classification of federal lands in the United States\nIn the United States, national forest is a classification of protected and managed federal lands that are largely forest and woodland areas. They are owned collectively by the American people through the federal government and managed by the United States Forest Service, a division of the United States Department of Agriculture. The U.S. Forest Service is also a forestry research organization that provides financial assistance to the state and local forestry industry. There are 154 national forests in the United States.\nHistory.\nThe Land Revision Act of 1891, enacted during the presidency of Benjamin Harrison, allowed the president to set aside forest reserves on public lands. Harrison established 15 forest reserves containing more than 13\u00a0million acres of land. The bill was the result of concerted action by Los Angeles-area businessmen and property owners who were concerned by the harm being done to the watershed of the San Gabriel Mountains by ranchers and miners. Abbot Kinney and forester Theodore Lukens were key spokesmen for the effort.\nTimeline of legislation.\nThere have been multiple legislative acts to expand the scope of the national forest system, as well as shrinking it. In 2020, the Trump administration encouraged more forest products to be harvested to support a struggling economy. There was a plan to develop around 190\u00a0million acres of protected National Forests to increase logging, grazing, and energy resources. This would be facilitated through shrinking the rules and regulations required to get permits to conduct such business. In October 2020, the Trump administration proclaimed its goal of \"strengthening markets for wood products and incentivizing innovative manufacturing techniques\" and reported \"The Department of Agriculture\u2019s Forest Service sold 3.3 billion board feet of timber from national forests in fiscal year 2019 \u2014 the highest output since 1997\". Furthermore, President Trump signed an executive order to \"establish the United States One Trillion Trees Interagency Council\" in order to further the Federal Government's participation in this effort and repeal the current $30\u00a0million annual funding cap for the Reforestation Trust Fund.\nGeography.\nThe United States national forest comprises about 132 million acres. There are 154 national forests and 20 national grasslands containing 193\u00a0million acres (297,000\u00a0mi2/769\u00a0000\u00a0km2) of land. These lands comprise 8.5 percent of the total land area of the United States, an area about the size of Texas. About 87 percent of national forest land lies in the Western United States, mostly in mountain ranges. Alaska has 12 percent of all national forest lands.\nWithin the national forest system, there are 1,200 sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places and 23 are National Historic Landmarks. The National Historic Preservation Act requires the Forest Service to identify, investigate, and protect cultural resources on lands it manages.\nThe U.S. Forest Service also manages all of the United States national grasslands and nearly 50% of the United States national recreation areas.\nManagement.\nLand management of these areas focuses on conservation, timber harvesting, livestock grazing, watershed protection, wildlife, and recreation. Unlike national parks and other federal lands managed by the National Park Service, extraction of natural resources from national forests is permitted, and in many cases encouraged. Forest products are the resources removed and harvested from national forests. They may be for\u00a0commercial or personal use such as \u201clumber, paper, and firewood as well as 'special forest products' such as medicinal herbs, fungi, edible fruits and nuts, and other natural products\u201d. However, the first-designated wilderness areas, and some of the largest, are on national forest lands.\nThere are management decision conflicts between conservationists and environmentalists and natural resource extraction companies and lobbies (e.g. logging &amp; mining) over the protection and/or use of national forest lands. These conflicts center on endangered species protection, logging of old-growth forests, intensive clear cut logging, undervalued stumpage fees, mining operations and mining claim laws, and logging/mining access roadbuilding within national forests. Additional conflicts arise from concerns that the grasslands, shrublands, and forest understory are grazed by sheep, cattle, and more recently, rising numbers of elk and mule deer due to loss of predators.\nMany ski resorts and summer resorts operate on leased land in national forests.\nNational forests include 14 national monuments where resource extraction is restricted.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

There are three main games in the series: ' (1997), ' (1998), and \"\" (2001). \"The Fallen Lords\" was developed by Bungie, and published by Bungie in North America and Eidos Interactive in Europe. \"Soulblighter\" was also developed by Bungie, and was published by Bungie in North America and GT Interactive in Europe. \"The Wolf Age\" was developed by MumboJumbo, and co-published by Take-Two Interactive and Gathering of Developers for Windows and by Take-Two and MacSoft for Mac.\nAll three games received generally positive reviews. \"The Fallen Lords\" was especially lauded, and is credited as a defining title in the fledgling real-time tactics genre. Reviewers praised its plot, graphics, gameplay, level design, online multiplayer mode, and differentiation from traditional real-time strategy games. It went on to win multiple awards from publications such as \"PC Gamer\", \"Computer Gaming World\", \"Computer Games Strategy Plus\", and \"Macworld\". It was also a commercial success, selling over 350,000 units worldwide. \"Soulblighter\" was praised for improving on virtually every aspect of \"The Fallen Lords\", with critics citing more detailed graphics, enhanced sound effects, more varied gameplay, better AI, and a more intricate level design. It also sold very well, considerably outselling the original. \"The Wolf Age\" was seen as inferior to the two previous games, although it still garnered positive reviews. Reviewers praised the storyline, graphics, and general gameplay. Major points of criticism included the many bugs in the Windows version, and a poorly implemented online multiplayer mode. Some critics felt the game was rushed to release, with several speculating the development team had not been given enough time to complete it satisfactorily.\nThe \"Myth\" series as a whole, and \"Soulblighter\" in particular, supported an active online community for over a decade after the official servers went offline. The first formally organized group of volunteer-programmers was MythDevelopers, who initially formed with the purpose of fixing the bug-ridden Windows version of \"The Wolf Age\". MythDevelopers were given access to the source code of both the first games by Bungie and \"The Wolf Age\" by Take-Two. The most recently active \"Myth\" development group is Project Magma, an offshoot of MythDevelopers. These groups have worked to provide ongoing technical support for the games, update them to newer operating systems, fix bugs, release unofficial patches, create mods, and maintain online servers for multiplayer gaming. As of 2017, the IP is owned by Take-Two Interactive (which owned 20% of Bungie before Microsoft's acquisition), but the trademark registration expired in 2021.\nGameplay.\nAll three \"Myth\" games are real-time tactics games. Unlike in real-time strategy gameplay, the player does not engage in resource micromanagement or economic macromanagement, does not construct a base or buildings, and does not gradually build up their army by acquiring resources and researching new technologies. Instead, each level begins with the player's army already assembled and ready for combat. During the game, the player controls forces of various sizes made up of different units, each possessing their own strengths and weaknesses. In single-player mode, only Light units are playable, but in online multiplayer mode, the player can control both Light and Dark units.\nBasic gameplay in all three games consists of the player selecting and commanding units. The player clicks a unit to select it. A selected unit is marked by a surrounding yellow rectangle, beside which is a health meter, which diminishes as the unit takes damage. In \"Soulblighter\" and \"The Wolf Age\", units capable of using magic also have a mana meter, which diminishes through magic use and slowly regenerates over time. Units do not regenerate health, and there is no way to construct new units (although in some single-player missions, reinforcements are automatically received at predetermined points). When the player double-clicks on any unit, all nearby units of the same type are also selected. To select multiple units of different types, the player can either \"shift click\" (hold down the shift key while clicking individual units) or use \"band-selection\" (click and drag the cursor across the screen, selecting all units within the inscribed rectangle). All units on screen, irrespective of type, can be selected by pressing the enter key. The player can also assign manually selected groups of units to a specific key on the keyboard; pressing that key then instantly selects the units in the desired group. In \"The Wolf Age\", the HUD also includes a \"Unit Grouping Bar\" which allows the player to select their group by clicking on the corresponding number rather than using the keyboard.\nOnce one or more units have been selected, the player can click on the ground to make them walk to the selected spot, or click on an enemy to make them attack. Units with projectile weapons, such as archers and dwarves can also be ordered to attack a specific spot on the ground, rather than an enemy. It is also important that the player have their units facing in the correct direction. In \"The Fallen Lords\", this is accomplished by \"gesture clicking\": using the mouse to indicate which way the units will face when they reach their destination. In \"Soulblighter\" and \"The Wolf Age\", it can be accomplished by either gesture clicking, or by pressing the left or right arrow key as the units move to the selected location. Facing the correct direction is especially relevant when using formations. After selecting a group of units, the player must press the corresponding formation button on the keyboard, and then click on the ground where they want the units to form. The player can also order all selected units to scatter and to retreat. In \"Soulblighter\" and \"The Wolf Age\", all formations\u2014as well as commands such as stopping, guarding, scattering, retreating, and reversing direction\u2014are also available via a single click in the Control Bar at the bottom of the screen.\nWhen a single unit is selected, information about that unit appears in the \"Status Bar\" at the top of the HUD: the unit's name, biography, number of kills, number of battles survived, and (if he is capable of carrying items) inventory. When multiple units are selected, only the names, types, and quantity of units appear. The HUD also features a transparent overhead mini-map, which displays information about the current battlefield\u2014the player's field of vision is indicated by a yellow trapezoid, enemy units appear as red dots, friendly non-playable units as blue dots, and the player's army as green dots. The player can click anywhere on the mini-map to instantly jump to that location. However, the mini-map does not initially display the entire battlefield; the player must explore the area for it to become fully mapped. In \"Soulblighter\", the player can also order troops to move to any location on the mapped area of the battlefield by right-clicking on that area in the mini-map.\nThe player has full control over the camera throughout the game, and can move, orbit, pan, and zoom the camera via the keyboard. In \"The Fallen Lords\", the mouse can be used to move the camera forwards, backwards, left, and right by moving the cursor to the top, bottom, left, or right of the screen, respectively. In \"Soulblighter\" and \"The Wolf Age\", the player can also select preferences to enable rotation and orbiting via the mouse by moving the cursor to the top and bottom corners of the screen, respectively.\nSelecting and commanding units only forms the basic interactions of the \"Myth\" games. Battles are more complex than simply commanding units to attack the enemy\u2014strategy, battlefield conditions, and even weather all play important roles. For example, due to the game's physics engine, objects collide with each another and the terrain. This can manifest itself simply in a severed head bouncing off one of the player's units and changing direction, but it can also have more serious consequences, such as friendly fire. For instance, archers firing at enemies engaged in melee combat risk hitting allied units, causing the same amount of damage. Also, projectiles are not guaranteed to hit; they are merely propelled in the direction instructed by the physics engine. Thus, for example, a dwarf could throw a molotov cocktail at an enemy on a hillside and miss, with the projectile rolling back down the hill towards the player's own units. Arrows may miss their intended target due to a small degree of simulated aiming error that becomes more significant at long range, or the target may move out of the way or behind cover.\nWeather also influences gameplay. Rain or snow can extinguish explosive-based attacks, and in \"The Wolf Age\", strong wind can cause problems for archers in hitting their targets. It is also much easier for projectile units to hit enemies below them rather than above them, and as such, positioning of the player's units is an important aspect of the game.\nSingle-player.\nIn each of the three games' single-player campaigns, the player starts each mission with a group of soldiers and must use that group to accomplish a specific goal or set of goals. These goals can involve killing a certain number of enemies, defending a location, reaching a certain point on the map, escorting a unit safely to a certain area, or destroying a specific object or enemy. The focus of the single-player campaign is on a smaller force defeating a much larger enemy force; in every mission, the Light units are outnumbered by enemies, often vastly, and so the player must use the terrain, employ the specific skills of their individual units, and gradually decrease the enemy force, or attempt to avoid it altogether. Units in the single-player campaign acquire experience with each kill. Experience increases attack rate, accuracy, and defence, and any unit that survives a battle will carry over to the next battle with their accumulated experience (assuming the next battle features units of that type). In the single-player campaign in \"The Wolf Age\", players can avail of a \"morale boost\" for normal units when fighting alongside \"Champion\" units; any normal unit engaged in combat whilst in close proximity to a Champion unit will gain experience at a faster rate than normal.\nMultiplayer.\nUpon release, \"The Fallen Lords\" and \"Soulblighter\" could be used for multiplayer gaming on Bungie.net, or via a LAN on PC or AppleTalk on Mac, whilst \"The Wolf Age\" could be played on GameSpy, or via a LAN on PC or AppleTalk on Mac. In multiplayer, the player starts with an army, and can customize it by trading units with other players, using point values that approximate the value of the units being traded.\nAll three games have similar, but not identical, multiplayer modes. The following modes are common to each of the three games:\nUnique to \"Soulblighter\" and \"The Wolf Age\" are the following modes:\nUnique to \"Soulblighter\" is \"Choke the Chicken\" (identical to Assassin, except the target unit assigned to each team is a non-playable chicken). Unique to \"The Wolf Age\" is \"Assault\" (teams alternative defending a flag from their opponent; the attacking team scores a point if they touch the flag, the defending team score a point if they prevent the flag being touched. The winner is the team with the most points after both teams have attacked and defended).\nHistory.\nDevelopment.\n\"The Fallen Lords\".\n\"\" was originally conceived by Jason Jones as Bungie was nearing the end of development of \"Marathon Infinity\" in late 1995. They had planned to do another first-person shooter as their next game. However, when Jones saw the first screenshots from id Software's \"Quake\", he became concerned that Bungie's new game would be too similar. As such, he approached his colleagues with the question: \"What do you think about having this world with 100 guys fighting 100 other guys in 3D?\" His idea was to bring Bungie's experience in 3D action games to a real-time strategy (RTS) game. The team agreed their new shooter was developing along lines too similar to \"Quake\", and, as such, they abandoned the project, and switched focus to what ultimately became \"Myth\".\nDubbed \"The Giant Bloody War Game\", initial inspirations were films such as Mel Gibson's \"Braveheart\" and literature such as Glen Cook's \"The Black Company\". Doug Zartman, Bungie's director of public relations and one of the game's writers, explained: \"We wanted to capture the feeling that you get watching large groups of people clashing on the open field\". He was also eager to differentiate the game from standard RTS games:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We tried real hard to come up with a term that was different from \"real-time\". We're calling it a \"multimetric tactical game\". \"Multimetric\" - I made that word up - because it's not an isometric game in the conventional sense. There are many angles a player can have and many views the camera can take. And we're calling it \"tactical\" because there are no elements of the game that focus on resources or management. It's strictly a tactical game.\nOnce they had decided on the basic game mechanics, which ultimately became known as \"real-time tactics\", they drew up a list of elements they wanted to avoid (RTS clich\u00e9s, references to Middle-earth, allusions to the Arthurian legend, any narrative involving \"little boys coming of age and saving the world\") and those they wanted to incorporate (\"any ideas that contributed to the visual realism of the game\", such as a 3D landscape, polygonal buildings, particle-based weather, and battlefields littered with body parts). They were also determined to include a robust online multiplayer mode as a key gameplay feature.\nWork on the game began in January 1996, with a major early decision being to develop and release the game simultaneously for both Mac OS and Microsoft Windows. At the time, Bungie's only Windows game had been a port of \"\", with which they had been unhappy, and they were determined \"The Fallen Lords\" be a genuine cross-platform release. As such, 90% of the game's source code was platform-independent, with 5% written for Windows subroutines and 5% for Mac-specific functionality. All of the game's data was stored in platform-independent data files called \"tags\", which were automatically byte-swapped when necessary and accessed via a cross-platform file manager.\nAlthough \"The Fallen Lords\" employs a fully 3D terrain, with 3D polygonal buildings, the characters are 2D sprites. To bring the 3D environment and the 2D characters together, the team developed four separate programming tools: \"Tag Editor\" (edited the constants in the cross-platform data files), \"Extractor\" (handled the 2D sprites and the sequencing of their animations), \"Loathing\" (the map editor), and \"Fear\" (dealt with the 3D polygonal models such as houses, pillars, and walls). Of the four programs, Jones explained:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Tag Editor lets you edit everything from the physics of the game, to the color of the units, how they move, and how they attack. There's another tool that we use to import graphics called the Extractor, and there's a third tool called Loathing. Loathing is basically the map editor for \"Myth\". You import your map into it, you change the heights, and you place your units on the map in Loathing. The fourth tool that complements Loathing is called Fear. Fear takes care of all the models; it is used to import the 3D rendered models.\nBy November 1996, Bungie had a demo with rudimentary gameplay in place. In an effort to create media buzz, they took the demo to several gaming magazines. Speaking in 2000, Doug Zartman explained the physics engine was a major factor in the game even at this early stage:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There wasn't much gameplay in what we showed them - two small groups on opposite sides of a small map rushing at each other, becoming a bloody knot at the middle where they all collided and blew each other up. And the AI was crude. But the reviewers could see that it had strategic combat on real 3D terrain - something no other game at the time had, something that radically changed how the game was played; an archer could fire farther from the top of the hill than from in the valley. It was easy to demonstrate to the press that an archer on high ground was going to defeat an archer down in the valley.\n\"The Fallen Lords\" originally supported both software rendering and 3dfx's Glide hardware acceleration. Soon after it was released, Bungie released a v1.1 upgrade patch, which added support for Rendition's Redline, and 3dfx's Voodoo Rush.\n\"Soulblighter\".\n\"\" went into development immediately after \"The Fallen Lords\" proved a commercial success. One of Bungie's main goals with the sequel was to include gameplay aspects and game mechanics which they had wanted to feature in \"The Fallen Lords\", but had been unable to implement due to time constraints. Of the initial planning for \"Soulblighter\", Alex Seropian, Bungie's co-founder, said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We had a lot of specific design goals for \"Myth II\". Part of those things are enhancements to the engine as well as the gameplay. There were some things in the gameplay and artificial intelligence that made the original annoyingly difficult, and those were some of the things we wanted to enhance. In addition to that, we decided to touch basically every facet of the game. We wanted to make the music and sound better, the graphics - so we basically retouched every area of the \"Myth\" gaming experience.\nNew to \"Soulblighter\" were moving 3D models within the gaming world, something none of Bungie staff had ever created before. For example, the opening level features a fully functional windmill, and a later level features a drawbridge that closes as the level begins, and which the player must then lower so their army can gain access to a castle. Although the original game featured the same kind of 3D polygonal models, none of them moved, and implementing this feature proved to be one of the biggest challenges the team encountered in making the game. Another challenge also involved something not seen in the first game: a level set indoors. For this level, which is set in a large castle, the AI had to be rewritten as two enemy units could be right beside one another but not be able to see each other because of a wall between them. Previously, two units standing beside one another would automatically attack. Writing this new code into the AI scripting language proved especially difficult for the programmers.\nIn terms of the game's graphics, as with \"The Fallen Lords\", each level in \"Soulblighter\" is constructed on a polygonal mesh. However, the mesh used in the sequel is four times finer than in the original, and hence the graphics are more detailed and smoother. Like the first game, although the game world itself is fully 3D, the characters populating each level are 2D sprites. The sprites in \"Soulblighter\" have many more frames of animation than those in \"The Fallen Lords\", and so move more smoothly. Explaining why the team stuck with the concept of using 2D sprites in a 3D terrain, producer Tuncer Deniz stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It's a performance issue. The reason we went with sprites for the characters is because in \"Myth\" you can have one hundred units on the screen at the same time, and if they were all polygonal models, even those with the fastest home computers wouldn't be able to play the game.\n\"Soulblighter\" originally supported software rendering, all 3dfx and Rendition GPUs, and any graphics cards that supported Direct3D for Windows and QuickDraw 3D for Mac. The game also supported 3D audio, specifically Aureal Semiconductor's A3D and Creative Labs' EAX.\nWhen \"Soulblighter\" was released, Bungie included the \"Fear\" and \"Loathing\" programming tools, which allowed players to create new units and maps. Bungie themselves strongly encouraged the creativity of their fan base in using these tools. For example, in April 1999, they issued a press release regarding the World War II total conversion, \"Myth II: Recon\", saying: \"This kind of plug-in was exactly what the \"Myth II\" tools were intended to inspire, and is an excellent sign that \"Myth\" mapmakers are taking this game world in fascinating new directions.\"\n\"The Wolf Age\".\nIn 1999, Bungie sold 19.9% of their shares to Take-Two Interactive. In June 2000, Bungie was purchased outright by Microsoft, with Take-Two acquiring the \"Oni\" and \"Myth\" intellectual properties. \"\" was announced by Take-Two subsidiary Gathering of Developers in January 2001, when they revealed MumboJumbo were developing the game for Windows and Mac OS. \"The Wolf Age\" would be MumboJumbo's first game.\nAddressing the issue of remaining faithful to the two previous games whilst still introducing new elements to the franchise, MumboJumbo president Mark Dochtermann explained the developers did not intend to reinvent the series' basic gameplay, although they were keen to try out new things: \"There's a lot left to explore in the \"Myth\" franchise even before we go in a somewhat different route. Although, we are taking a [new] route in terms of adding 3D acceleration, 3D models, and doing stuff with the terrain engine and physics that are still way beyond what the other RTS games are doing right now.\" Similarly, producer and lead designer Scott Campbell stated: \"We intend to pay respect to \"Myth\" and its fans. We don't care to change the whole appeal of the game just so we can call it ours.\" With this in mind, MumboJumbo hired three members of \"Soulblighter\"'s modding community to work on the game. Although initially hired to work on technical aspects, they became invaluable to MumboJumbo in terms of writing the storyline. Executive producer Mike Donges explained that \"they're our \"Myth\" lore experts, so if we try to put in something new, they have the ability to [reject it]\".\nAlthough \"The Wolf Age\" was built using \"Soulblighter\"'s source code, the developers made significant changes, the single biggest of which was that everything in \"The Wolf Age\" is rendered in OpenGL 3D, including the characters and all environmental objects. \"The Wolf Age\" was the first \"Myth\" game to feature fully 3D characters, rather than 2D sprites in a 3D environment. Of the move to full 3D, Dochtermann points out that the 3D engine allows for things not possible in the previous games: \"There's some very cool kinematics stuff. So when you have explosions, and when your units move through the world, the trees will respond. And not just blowing them up. You'll see the shock waves from explosions, and you're affecting the environment a lot more. It's a lot more realistic.\" The new game engine also supported real-time shadows and dynamic lighting, as well as being capable of blending six to seven different texture layers, depending on how close the camera is to the action.\nRegarding the programming tools used to create the game, MumboJumbo initially began by using Bungie's \"Fear\" and \"Loathing\". However, they never intended to use them for very long, with the plan always being to develop their own tool. Speaking a few months into development, Campbell stated: \"We are planning on doing a merger of the tools later on [...] we're actually making tools right now that we will be using for \"Myth III\" that are not only cross-platform compatible, but will also allow you to do all the neat new things, use all the new scripting commands and the new models and 3D units and stuff that we're using in this game.\" The new tool was eventually called \"Vengeance\". At the E3 event in May 2001, MumboJumbo promised that Vengeance would ship with the game.\n\"The Wolf Age\" went gold on October 17, 2001, completing a development cycle of only ten months, a relatively fast time to develop a major video game. Soon before the game's release, \"PC Gamer\"'s Jim Preston wrote he was skeptical as to whether the developer had been given enough time to satisfactorily complete the game.\nOn November 16, lead programmer Andrew Meggs posted on Mythvillage.org that the entire \"Myth III\" PC team had been laid off by MumboJumbo the same day the game had been released, November 2. In a post titled \"Some ugly, but honest truths\", Meggs wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The basic reason was that there was no next project lined up and funded, nor was there expected to be in the near future, it's expensive to keep a team of salaried people around doing nothing, and MumboJumbo was not a huge business with infinitely deep pockets. There's a tangled web between the MumboJumbo Irvine project team, its parent company United Developers and the game's publisher Take-Two. I wouldn't blame anyone specifically for the collapse - call it everybody's fault if you're the angry sort or nobody's fault if you're charitable.\nMeggs explained the team knew there were problems with the Windows version of the game that needed addressing, but, as they had been fired, they were unable to do so. He stated they had been working on a patch to fix many of these problems when they were let go, and he was unsure if this patch would be released. He also acknowledged that many of the criticisms regarding bugs in the game would be addressed by the patch. The same day Meggs made his post, November 16, MumboJumbo closed their offices in Irvine, California, with a view to consolidate their resources in their Dallas headquarters.\nThree days later, MumboJumbo denied the \"Myth III\" team had been laid off, saying all staff members had been invited to work in the Dallas office. They also announced the patch Meggs had spoken of would be released within the week. On December 19, Mark Dochtermann promised the patch would be released before Christmas, along with Vengeance, which had not been shipped with the game. The patch was never officially released by MumboJumbo.\nEnd-of-support.\nAfter Bungie released the \"Total Codex\" bundle in 1999, which contained \"The Fallen Lords\" v1.3, \"Soulblighter\" v1.3, and the \"Soulblighter\" expansion pack, \"Myth II: Chimera\", they ceased working to develop the game's source code, as Microsoft wanted them to concentrate on \"\". The official Bungie \"Myth\" servers were closed in February 2002.\nCommunity-driven development.\nDespite the official end-of-life, the \"Myth\" series continued to have an active online fanbase, particularly \"Soulblighter\". The first organised group of programmers, artists, and coders from the game's community was known as MythDevelopers, who requested and were granted access to the source code so as to continue its development. With the permission of Take-Two, Bungie released their entire archive of \"Myth\"-related materials to MythDevelopers, including the source code, artwork, all creative files (such as maps, 3D models, scripts, etc.), and documentation, over 80 gigabytes of material. MythDevelopers was also granted access to the source code for \"The Wolf Age\". Bungie also open-sourced their \"Myth\" metaserver source code in 2002.\nMythDevelopers used this material to improve and further develop the games. Although their initial focus was on the bug-ridden release version of \"The Wolf Age\", they also worked to update the first two games to newer operating systems on both Mac and PC, fix bugs, and create unofficial patches to enhance both the games themselves and the mapmaking tools. They also developed their own library, dubbed the Myth Core Library, which provided networking, input routines, and other low-level functions. This enabled MythDevelopers to avoid the necessity of licensing any external libraries, and instead allowed them to develop everything in-house. This was part of their deal with Take-Two, as they couldn't incorporate anything into the games which they would be unable to give Take-Two the rights to should the company ever ask for the source code back; all modifications remained the intellectual property of Take-Two, who were free to use them in a future commercial version of \"Myth\", if they ever wanted to re-release an upgraded version of one or more of the games, or incorporate the modifications into the development of a new \"Myth\" game.\nIn April 2003, MythDevelopers released a v1.1 patch for \"The Wolf Age\" for both Windows and Mac. Fixing over forty gameplay and stability issues, and addressing numerous bugs, the patch also included new multiplayer maps and gameplay modes. MythDevelopers disbanded in December 2003, with Project Magma becoming the main development group for \"The Fallen Lords\" and \"Soulblighter\", and FlyingFlip Studios for \"The Wolf Age\". Magma's final patch for \"The Fallen Lords\" was v1.5, released in 2005, which added support for OpenGL 1.3 for both PC and Mac. FlyingFlip's final patch for \"The Wolf Age\" was v1.3, released in 2004, which introduced multiple gameplay and stability improvements, as well as bug fixes, and performance enhancements. FlyingFlip disbanded in 2007.\n\"Soulblighter\" received considerably more attention from the modding community than either \"The Fallen Lords\" or \"The Wolf Age\". Between 2003 and 2013, Project Magma released multiple major patches, each of which included fixes for bugs, graphical problems, gameplay problems, and interface issues, as well as improve the Fear and Loathing tools and the online multiplayer mode. However, each patch also tended to feature one or more \"major\" enhancement. For example, v1.3.2, developed in association with MythDevelopers in 2003, allowed \"Soulblighter\" to run natively under OS X. Also developed in association with MythDevelopers in 2003 was v1.4, which introduced OpenGL support for the OS X version and allowed the player to play \"Soulblighter\" with \"Fallen Lords\" style gameplay (dubbed v\"TFL\"). In 2004, Magma released their first standalone patch, v1.5, which was originally intended as a minor clean-up patch for some of the problems introduced in v1.4. For example, v1.4 broke a number of fan-developed plug-ins. Additionally, as the developers did not have access to \"The Fallen Lords\" source code when designing v\"TFL\", the feature was unreliable. Magma's plan with v1.5 was to get the gameplay and plug-in compatibility back to the standard of Bungie's last official version of the game, but retain the v1.4 features that worked. During development of v1.5, they also gained access to \"The Fallen Lords\" source code, and so completely rewrote the v\"TFL\" option. Magma's final patch, v1.8, was released in 2013, and added several new game modes to multiplayer gaming, improved the usage of CPU resources, added a new texture decompression code which loads sprite frames twice as fast as before, enhanced both the texture mapping and the pixel shader, and included (for the first time in a Magma patch) Linux-specific improvements.\nIn May 2023, an archive said to be the largest historic collection of Myth items was placed on the Internet Archive. At well over 1,200 Myth maps, the source centers on 3rd party versions of solo, network, and scenario entries between the initial November 1997 Myth release through early 2023.\nCommunity servers.\nPrior to disbanding, MythDevelopers created and operated PlayMyth.net, the most popular online \"Myth\" server after the official servers were taken offline. Although built using the \"Soulblighter\" server, PlayMyth could also run both \"The Fallen Lords\" and \"The Wolf Age\", which was developed by MumboJumbo using a network gameplay system designed to run on GameSpy rather than Bungie. PlayMyth went offline in October 2007 after it was repeatedly hacked, with the most popular servers becoming MariusNet.com and GateofStorms.net.\nMariusNet had been online since just prior to Bungie's \"Myth\" servers going offline, and was officially approved by Bungie. The original impetus behind the project was as a temporary replacement for \"Myth\" players in case the original servers were shut down, which had been rumored for some time. The Bungie servers had not supported \"The Fallen Lords\" since November 2001, and the community believed the servers would soon close for \"Soulblighter\" as well. When \"The Fallen Lords\" servers closed in November, the only way to play a multiplayer game was via a LAN or AppleTalk, and MariusNet was created as a Bungie \"emulator\", which, like PlayMyth, supported all three \"Myth\" games, and thus gave players a way to play \"The Fallen Lords\" online. At the time, Bungie had not open-sourced the metaserver source code, so creating a network for \"The Fallen Lords\" was accomplished via reverse engineering. Dave Carlile, the main programmer of the server, explained:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We started with some information about the \"Myth 2\" network protocol, and hoped \"Myth\" was the same or very similar. [Todd Snyder] then used a packet sniffer to look at the data being sent back and forth between the \"Myth 2\" client and the server in order to learn more. We initially made a partial \"Myth 2\" server to get the basics down, then spent hundreds of hours figuring out the differences in packet structure in \"Myth\". For a few of the more difficult pieces we used a disassembler to take apart the client code, and also a debugger to trace through the code.\nMariusNet closed in 2014 when the server company shut down, and the hardware was damaged whilst being moved to its new location. GateofStorms, which was created by Project Magma and only supports \"Soulblighter\" v1.8 (released by Magma in 2013), remains active, and continues to host individual games and tournaments.\nReception.\nAll three main games in the \"Myth\" series received positive reviews, especially \"The Fallen Lords\" and \"Soulblighter\", which were universally acclaimed. Although \"The Wolf Age\" was generally well reviewed, it was seen as considerably inferior to the two previous games.\nGameSpot's Michael E. Ryan wrote of \"The Fallen Lords\" that it \"can claim its place among the best strategy games on the market\", calling it \"one of the most impressive games you'll see this year\", and \"a truly remarkable real-time strategy game\". Game Revolution's Calvin Hubble called it \"one of the most impressive looking strategy games to hit the market\".\nRyan called \"Soulblighter\" \"as good as a computer game can possibly be\" and \"one of the best games to be released this year\". Hubble called it \"both one of the best sequels to hit the scene and one of the finest titles on the RTS market\". IGN's Tal Blevins said the game \"lives up to (and surpasses) all of the hype surrounding [it]\".\nIGN's Dan Adams wrote of \"The Wolf Age\": \"Fans of the series shouldn't be disappointed by MumboJumbo's effort to follow in the mighty footsteps that Bungie left behind\". GameSpot's Sam Parker wrote that \"[\u2026] \"Myth III\"'s single-player game represents the best the \"Myth\" series has to offer\". However, he was critical of the absence of many promised multiplayer features, the absence of the Vengeance mapmaking tool, and compatibility issues with Windows XP. GameSpy's William Abner wrote: \"[\u2026] \"The Wolf Age\" isn't a complete product. It's close. And parts of it are just as fun, if not more so, than the earlier games, but a laundry list of bugs, hardware glitches, and severe multiplayer issues keep the game from reaching its potential.\" He too was critical of the absence of Vengeance and of multiplayer mode.\nSales and awards.\nAccording to Bungie co-founder Alex Seropian, \"The Fallen Lords\" cost roughly $2 million to produce and market, by far Bungie's most expensive game up to that time, and as such, they needed it to be financially successful, especially as it was their first original PC game. The game did prove to be a commercial success, selling over 350,000 units worldwide at roughly $40 per unit, earning the company $14 million, and becoming Bungie's most successful game thus far. By 2000, the game had over 100,000 people registered with online accounts at Bungie for multiplayer games. The success of the game also helped Bungie rank #101 in \"Inc.\"'s 1998 list of the 500 fastest growing private corporations in North America. Primarily due to the success of \"The Fallen Lords\", Bungie's profits had increased by 2,228% from 1993 to 1997.\n\"The Fallen Lords\" also won numerous awards, including \"Real-Time Strategy Game of the Year\" from \"PC Gamer\", \"Strategy Game of the Year\" from \"Computer Gaming World\", and \"Game of the Year\" from both \"Computer Games Strategy Plus\" and \"Macworld\". \"Online Game Review\" named it one of the fifty greatest games ever made.\n\"Soulblighter\" considerably outsold \"The Fallen Lords\". In North America, pre-orders for the game reached 140,000 units. When v1.1 was released on January 7, day one sales reached roughly the same number of units the original sold worldwide.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "42666", "revid": "49850851", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42666", "title": "Zerg", "text": "Fictional alien race\nThe Zerg are a fictional race of insectoid aliens obsessed with assimilating other races into their swarm in pursuit of genetic perfection and the overriding antagonists for much of the \"StarCraft\" franchise. Unlike the fictional universe's other primary races, the Protoss and Terrans, the Zerg lack technological inclination. Instead, they \"force-evolve\" genetic traits by directed mutation in order to match such technology. Operating as a hive mind-linked \"chain of command\", the Zerg strive for \"genetic perfection\" by assimilating the unique genetic code of advanced species deemed \"worthy\" into their own gene pool, creating numerous variations of specialized strains of Zerg gifted with unique adaptations. Despite being notoriously cunning and ruthlessly efficient, the majority of Zerg species have low intelligence, becoming mindless beasts if not connected to a \"hive-cluster\" or a \"command entity\".\nAs with the other races, the Zerg are the subject of a full single-player campaign in each of the series' real-time strategy video games. Zerg units are designed to be cost-efficient and fast to produce, encouraging players to overwhelm their opponents with sheer numerical advantage. Since the release of \"StarCraft\", the Zerg have become a gaming icon, described by \"PC Gamer UK\" as \"the best race in strategy history\". The term \"Zerg Rush\", or \"zerging\", is now commonly used to describe sacrificing economic development in favor of using many cheap, yet weak units to overwhelm an enemy by attrition or sheer numbers. The tactic is infamous; most experienced real-time strategy players are familiar with the tactic in one form or another.\nAttributes.\nBiology.\n\"Zerg\"-strain have two cell types at birth \u2014 one which creates random mutations, and another that hunts these mutations \u2014 the result being that any mutations that survive are the strongest of all. Modifying the \"Zerg\"-strain within all Zerg; rapidly forcing entire generations of Zerg to breed, evolve, and die within seconds, diversifying the relatively homogenous mix of recently assimilated species. Despite being a hive-minded species, the Zerg understand the principles of evolution and incorporate this into the development of their species. Zerg purposely situate themselves in harsh climates in order to further their own evolution through natural selection. Only the strongest with the best mutations survive, and they assimilate only the strongest species into their gene pool.\nSociety.\nIt was stated in an interview by Blizzard employees that the Zerg Swarm are universally feared, hated, and hunted by all the sapient species of the Milky Way. The Zerg are a collective consciousness of a variety of different species assimilated into the Zerg genome. The Swarms' organization, psychological and economic, is more like that of ants or termites: they are communal entities, a people efficiently adapted by evolution. Every thousand Zerg warriors killed at a cost of one Terran soldier was a net victory for the Zerg; the Zerg Swarm didn't care any more about expending warriors than the Terrans cared about expending ammunition.\nThe Zerg were originally commanded by and unified by their absolute obedience to the Zerg collective sentience known as the Zerg Overmind, a manifestation of this hive mind, and under the Overmind's control the Zerg strove for genetic perfection by assimilating the favorable traits of other species. Zerg creatures are rapidly and selectively evolved into deadly and efficient killers to further the driving Zerg imperative of achieving absolute domination. After a species has been assimilated into the Swarm, it is mutated toward a different function within its hierarchy, from being a hive worker to a warrior strain. \"StarCraft\"'s manual notes that some species bear little resemblance to their original forms after just a short time into assimilation (an example would be the formerly peaceful Slothien species, which was assimilated and mutated into the vicious Hydralisk strain and so on). The Overmind controls the Swarm through secondary agents called cerebrates. Cerebrates command an individual brood of Zerg, each with a distinct tactical role within the hierarchy. Cerebrates further delegate power through the use of overlords for battlefield direction and queens for hive watch.\nThe quest for 'genetic perfection' is a pseudo-religious concept to Zerg that drives them on a steady state of evolution and conflict; the Zerg believed there was a state that the zerg could reach where they no longer needed to evolve, that their evolutionary form would never have to change again because they could already adapt to any situation. Abathur, an evolution master, doubted that this was possible, but reasoned that \"chasing the illusion of perfection\" was, regardless, tactically sound.\nThe vast majority of the Zerg do not have any free will as they are genetically forced to obey the commands of those further up the Zerg hierarchy, although they are sufficiently intelligent to form strategies and work as a team on the battlefield. Despite this, the average Zerg has no sense of self preservation. Along with the Overmind, the cerebrates are the only Zerg with full sapience, each with its own personality and methods, although they too are genetically incapable of disobeying the Overmind. The Overmind also possesses the ability to reincarnate its cerebrates should their bodies be killed, although Protoss dark templar energies are capable of disrupting this process. If a cerebrate is completely dead and cannot be reincarnated, the Overmind loses control of the cerebrate's brood, causing it to mindlessly rampage and attack anything. As a result of the Overmind's death in \"StarCraft\" and the subsequent destruction of a new Overmind in \"Brood War\", the remaining cerebrates perished, as they could not survive without an Overmind. Sarah Kerrigan replaced the cerebrates with \"brood mothers\". These creatures fulfil much the same purpose, but are loyal to Kerrigan and could survive her temporary departure during the events of \"Starcraft 2\".\nAn exception to all of this would be the Primal Zerg, who inhabit the original Zerg homeworld of Zerus (as seen in \"Heart of the Swarm\"). The Zerg Hive Mind was created to control the Zerg, and eventually put them under the control of the main antagonist of the series, the fallen Xel'Naga Amon. Some Zerg, however, managed to avoid being subsumed. These are the Primal Zerg, who have much the same genetic abilities but are not bound to the Overmind. These creatures are each independently sapient, and if they follow a leader it is because they choose to. Their lack of a Hive Mind also shields them from specific psionic attacks engineered to counter the Zerg Hive Mind.\nZerg worlds.\nZerg have conquered and/or infested many worlds, but only two of them are important:\nDepiction.\nThe Zerg were created from the native lifeforms of Zerus, who had the natural ability to absorb the \"essence\" of creatures they killed, transforming their bodies to gain new adaptations. The Xel'Naga created the Overmind and bound the primal Zerg to its will. They gave the Overmind a powerful desire to travel across the stars and absorb useful lifeforms into the Swarm, particularly the Protoss, their previous creation, so as to become the ultimate lifeform.\nThe Zerg are a completely organic race, making no use of lifeless technology and instead using specialized organisms for every function efficiently fulfilled through biological adaptation and planned mutation of the Zerg strains. Their buildings are specialized organs within the living, growing organism of a Zerg nest, as are the Leviathans \"space ships\" that carry them across space. Zerg colonies produce a carpet of bio-matter referred to as the \"creep\", which essentially provides nourishment for Zerg structures and creatures. The visual aesthetic of the Zerg greatly resembles that of invertebrates such as crustaceans and insects (and certainly draws inspiration from the creatures from the Alien movies). The Zerg are shown to be highly dependent on their command structure: if a Zerg should lose its connection to the hive mind, it may turn passive and incapable of action, or become completely uncontrollable and attack allies and enemies alike.\nZerg buildings and units are entirely organic in-game, and all Zerg can regenerate slowly without assistance (though not as quickly as Protoss shields or Terran medivac). Zerg production is far more centralized than with the Terrans and Protoss; a central hatchery must be utilized to create new Zerg, with other structures providing the necessary technology tree assets, whereas the other two races can produce units from several structures. Zerg units tend to be weaker than those of the other two races, but are also cheaper, allowing for rush tactics to be used. Some Zerg units are capable of infesting enemies with various parasites that range from being able to see what an enemy unit sees to spawning Zerg inside an enemy unit. In addition, Zerg can infest some Terran buildings, allowing for the production of special infested Terran units.\nAppearances.\nIn \"StarCraft\", the Zerg are obsessed with the pursuit of genetic purity, and are the focus of the game's second episode. With the Xel'Naga\u2013empowered Protoss targeted as the ultimate lifeform, the Zerg invade the Terran colonies in the Koprulu Sector to assimilate the Terrans' psionic potential and give the Zerg an edge over the Protoss. Through the actions of the Sons of Korhal, the Zerg are lured to the Confederate capital Tarsonis, where they capture the psionic ghost agent Sarah Kerrigan and infest her. Returning to the Zerg base of operations on Char, the Zerg are attacked by the dark templar Zeratul, who accidentally gives the location of the Protoss homeworld Aiur to the Zerg Overmind. With victory in sight, the Overmind launches an invasion of Aiur and manifests itself on the planet. However, at the end of the game, the Protoss high templar Tassadar sacrifices himself to destroy the Overmind, leaving the Zerg to run rampant and leaderless across the planet.\nThe Zerg return in \"\" initially as uncontrolled indiscriminate killers without the will of the Overmind to guide them. Through the early portions of \"Brood War\", Sarah Kerrigan is at odds with the surviving cerebrates, who have formed a new Overmind to restore control of the Swarm. Through allying herself with the Protoss, Kerrigan strikes at the cerebrates, causing disruption of their plans. Eventually, the UED fleet takes control of Char and pacifies the new Overmind with drugs, putting the cerebrates and most of the Zerg under their control. Kerrigan retaliates by forming a tenuous alliance with the remnants of the Dominion and the forces of Jim Raynor and Fenix, their subsequent victories turning the tide against the UED. However, she later betrays the alliance by dealing long-term damage to the infrastructures of her allies and killing Fenix. Proceeding to blackmail Zeratul into killing the new Overmind, Kerrigan's forces destroy the remnants of the UED fleet, giving her full control of the Zerg and establishing the Swarm as the most powerful faction in the sector.\nIn ', Jim Raynor and the rebel forces who oppose both the Dominion and the Zerg, manage to secure an ancient Xel'Naga artifact and after successfully infiltrating Char, they use it to subjugate the Zerg and restore Kerrigan's human form. Once again without a unified leadership, the Zerg get divided into multiple broods feuding over control of the Swarm. This situation persists until the events of '. Kerrigan, believing Raynor to have been killed in a Dominion surprise attack, enters the original Zerg spawning pool to become the Queen of Blades again. This time she is no longer motivated to destroy humanity, having kept more of her original mindset due to the non-interference of the Zerg Hive Mind, and by extension, the Dark Voice, Amon.\nKerrigan is the protagonist and player character of StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm. After being deinfested, she was taken in Valerian Mengsk's hideout to research on her, until the Dominion attacks the facility, she escaped along with the rest of the facility, except Raynor, who was captured by Nova. She later learned that Raynor was executed and seeks revenge on Arcturus. As she enters a Leviathan, she controls the local Swarm inside, and starts rebuilding her forces from scratch. She later evolved into a Primal Zerg after a confrontation with Zeratul, leading her to the origins of the Zerg. She became a Primal, after absorbing the spawning pool and killing Primal Leaders to collect essence. With her newfound power, she initially takes the fight to the Dominion after subduing countless Queens. She was later shocked after she knows that Raynor survived and held by Dominion as a bargaining chip. She organizes a raid, rescuing Raynor but the man fell into disbelief that the one he saved, returns to being a monster. She also confronted an ancient Shapeshifter creating Hybrids at the behest of her former rival named Alexei Stukov. She later prepared to end Arcturus Mengsk's reign by killing him in his palace in Korhal. She later left to confront the Shapeshifter's master and only by allied effort, they finished them. Kerrigan left them to her Broodmother Zagara's control.\nCritical reception.\nOne of the main factors responsible for \"StarCraft\"'s positive reception is the attention paid to the three unique playable races, for each of which Blizzard developed completely different characteristics, graphics, backstories, and styles of gameplay, while keeping them balanced in performance against each other. Previous to this, most real-time strategy games consisted of factions and races with the same basic \"chess\" play styles and units with only superficial differences. The use of unique sides and asymmetric warfare in \"StarCraft\" has been credited with popularizing the concept within the real-time strategy genre. Contemporary reviews of the game have mostly praised the attention to the gameplay balance between the species, as well as the fictional narratives built around them.\nIn their review for \"StarCraft\", IGN's Tom Chick stated that the balance and difference between the races was \"remarkable\", continuing to praise the game's \"radical\" approach to different races and its high degree of success when compared with other games in the genre. IGN was also positive about the unit arrangements for the three races, crediting Blizzard Entertainment for not letting units become obsolete during extended play and for showing an \"extraordinary amount of patience in balancing them.\" GameSpot was complimentary of the species in its review for \"StarCraft\", describing the races as being full of personality. Stating that the use of distinct races allowed for the game \"to avoid the problem [of equal sides] that has plagued every other game in the genre\", GameSpot praised Blizzard Entertainment for keeping it \"well balanced despite the great diversity.\"\nOther reviews have echoed much of this positive reception. The site The Gamers' Temple described the species as \"very diverse but well-balanced, \" stating that this allowed for \"a challenging and fun gaming experience.\" Allgame stated that the inclusion of three \"dynamic\" species \"raises the bar\" for real-time strategy games, complimenting the game for forcing the player to \"learn how [the aliens'] minds work and not think like a human\". Commentators have also praised the aesthetic design of the three races; in particular, the powered armor worn by the Terran Marine was rated eleventh on in a \"Maxim\" feature on the top armor suits in video games, and ninth in a similar feature by Machinima.com.\nThis positive view, however, is not universally held.

The author had claimed that he based the book on his own experiences, but this was found after his death to be doubtful; Llewellyn was English-born and spent little time in Wales, though he was of Welsh descent. Llewellyn gathered material for the novel from conversations with local mining families in the village of Gilfach Goch, in southeast Wales.\nIn the United States, Llewellyn won the National Book Award for favourite novel of 1940, voted by members of the American Booksellers Association.\nPlot summary.\nThe novel is set in South Wales during the reigns of Queen Victoria and King Edward VII. It tells the story of the Morgans, a respectable mining family of the South Wales Valleys, through the eyes of the youngest son, Huw Morgan.\nHuw's academic ability sets him apart from his elder brothers and enables him to consider a future away from the dangerous coal mines. He loses his opportunity because of fighting with a schoolmaster who punishes children for speaking Welsh. His five brothers and his father are miners. After his eldest brother, Ivor, is killed in a mining accident, Huw moves in with Ivor's young widow, Bronwen, with whom he has always secretly been in love.\nOne of Huw's three sisters, Angharad, marries Iestyn Evans, the wealthy mine owner's son \u2013 whom she does not love \u2013 and the marriage is an unhappy one. She never overcomes her romantic relationship with Merddyn Gruffydd, a local minister, who had declined to marry her because of his poverty.\nHuw's father is later killed in a mine disaster. After everyone Huw has known either dies or moves away, and the village is reduced to a contaminated shell, and the house is being destroyed by a slag heap, he too decides to leave, and tells the story of his life just before going away.\nCharacters.\nThe Older Morgans:\nThe Middle Brothers:\nThese are Huw's young adult brothers. Ianto goes to London to find work early in the book, but returns unhappily; Owen and Gwilym do the same later.\nThe Younger Morgans: \nOther characters:\nFirst printing.\nThe first edition was published in 1939 by Michael Joseph Ltd, London. The first printing included a limited edition run of 200, numbered and signed by Richard Llewellyn. The original print run also included a glossary covering Welsh words and terms at the end of the book. \nSequels.\nThe author continued the story of Huw Morgan's life in three sequels:\nAdaptations.\nThe 1941 Hollywood film adaptation, which was highly successful, had a cast that included Walter Pidgeon, Maureen O'Hara, Anna Lee, Roddy McDowall (as Huw), Donald Crisp, and Barry Fitzgerald. None of the leading players was Welsh (though Welsh actor Rhys Williams made his screen debut in the film in a minor role). Directed by John Ford, \"How Green Was My Valley\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. \"How Green Was My Valley\" is available on DVD from 20th Century Fox as part of their 20th Century Fox Studio Classics collection.\nThe book has twice been adapted by the BBC for television, in 1960 and 1975. The 1960 adaptation featured Eynon Evans, Rachel Thomas and Glyn Houston. The 1975 production, scripted by Elaine Morgan, starred Stanley Baker, (Dame) Si\u00e2n Phillips, and Nerys Hughes.\nThe novel was adapted as a Broadway musical, called \"A Time for Singing\", which opened at the Broadway Theatre, New York, on 21 May 1966. The music was by John Morris; book and lyrics were by Gerald Freedman and John Morris. The production was directed by Mr. Freedman, and it starred Ivor Emmanuel, Tessie O'Shea, Shani Wallis, and Laurence Naismith.\nA stage version, adapted by Shaun McKenna was performed at the Theatre Royal in Northampton in 1990. It marked the stage debut of Aled Jones as the teenage Huw. It was directed by Michael Napier Brown and designed by Ray Lett.\nIn 2017, the book was also adapted as a short film, parts of which are shown in the music video for the song Pleader by the band alt-J.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "42674", "revid": "217750", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42674", "title": "Shor's algorithm", "text": "Quantum algorithm for integer factorizationShor's algorithm is a quantum algorithm for finding the prime factors of an integer. It was developed in 1994 by the American mathematician Peter Shor. It is one of the few known quantum algorithms with compelling potential applications and strong evidence of superpolynomial speedup compared to best known classical (non-quantum) algorithms. However, beating classical computers will require millions of qubits due to the overhead caused by quantum error correction.\nShor proposed multiple similar algorithms for solving the factoring problem, the discrete logarithm problem, and the period-finding problem. \"Shor's algorithm\" usually refers to the factoring algorithm, but may refer to any of the three algorithms. The discrete logarithm algorithm and the factoring algorithm are instances of the period-finding algorithm, and all three are instances of the hidden subgroup problem.\nOn a quantum computer, to factor an integer formula_1, Shor's algorithm runs in polynomial time, meaning the time taken is polynomial in formula_2. It takes quantum gates of order formula_3 using fast multiplication, or even formula_4 utilizing the asymptotically fastest multiplication algorithm currently known due to Harvey and van der Hoeven, thus demonstrating that the integer factorization problem is in complexity class BQP. Shor's algorithm is asymptotically faster than the most scalable classical factoring algorithm, the general number field sieve, which works in sub-exponential time: formula_5.\nFeasibility and impact.\nAssuming a quantum computer with a sufficient number of qubits could operate without succumbing to quantum noise and other quantum-decoherence phenomena, then Shor's algorithm could be used to break public-key cryptography schemes, such as\nRSA can be broken if factoring large integers is computationally feasible. As far as is known, this is not possible using classical (non-quantum) computers; no classical algorithm is known that can factor integers in polynomial time. However, Shor's algorithm shows that factoring integers can be done with a polynomial complexity circult on an ideal quantum computer. Thus, it might be feasible to defeat RSA by constructing a large enough quantum computer. This was a powerful motivator for the design and construction of quantum computers, and for the study of new quantum-computer algorithms. It has also facilitated research on new cryptosystems that are secure from quantum computers, collectively called post-quantum cryptography (PQC).\nPhysical implementation.\nAs of 2025, the high error rates of quantum computers and limited number of physical qubits available for quantum error correction, laboratory demonstrations of Shor's algorithm obtain correct results in only in a fraction of attempts, and have only succeeded with small semiprimes.\nIn 2001, Shor's algorithm was demonstrated by a group at IBM, who factored formula_6 into formula_7, using an NMR implementation of a quantum computer with seven qubits. After IBM's implementation, two independent groups implemented Shor's algorithm using photonic qubits, emphasizing that multi-qubit entanglement was observed when running the Shor's algorithm circuits. In 2012, the factorization of formula_6 was performed with solid-state qubits. Later, in 2012, the factorization of formula_9 was achieved. In 2016, the factorization of formula_6 was performed again using trapped-ion qubits. However, none of these demonstrations fulfill the requirements of Shor\u2019s algorithm: they compile the circuit using prior knowledge of the solution, and some have even oversimplified the algorithm in a way that makes it equivalent to coin flipping.\nAlgorithm.\nThe problem that we are trying to solve is: \"given an odd composite number formula_1, find its integer factors\".\nTo achieve this, Shor's algorithm consists of two parts:\nClassical reduction.\nA complete factoring algorithm is possible if we're able to efficiently factor arbitrary formula_1 into just two integers formula_13 and formula_14 greater than 1, since if either formula_13 or formula_14 are not prime, then the factoring algorithm can in turn be run on those until only primes remain.\nA basic observation is that, using Euclid's algorithm, we can always compute the GCD between two integers efficiently. In particular, this means we can check efficiently whether formula_1 is even, in which case 2 is trivially a factor. Let us thus assume that formula_1 is odd for the remainder of this discussion. Afterwards, we can use efficient classical algorithms to check whether formula_1 is a prime power. For prime powers, efficient classical factorization algorithms exist, hence the rest of the quantum algorithm may assume that formula_1 is not a prime power.\nIf those easy cases do not produce a nontrivial factor of formula_1, the algorithm proceeds to handle the remaining case. We pick a random integer formula_22 A possible nontrivial divisor of formula_1 can be found by computing formula_24, which can be done classically and efficiently using the Euclidean algorithm. If this produces a nontrivial factor (meaning formula_25), the algorithm is finished, and the other nontrivial factor is formula_26. If a nontrivial factor was not identified, then this means that formula_1 and the choice of formula_28 are coprime, so formula_29 is contained in the multiplicative group of integers modulo formula_30, having a multiplicative inverse modulo formula_30. Thus, formula_29 has a multiplicative order formula_33 modulo formula_30, meaning\n formula_35\nand formula_36 is the smallest positive integer satisfying this congruence.\nThe quantum subroutine finds formula_36. It can be seen from the congruence that formula_1 divides formula_39, written formula_40. This can be factored using difference of squares:\nformula_41\nSince we have factored the expression in this way, the algorithm doesn't work for odd formula_33 (because formula_43 must be an integer), meaning that the algorithm would have to restart with a new formula_28. Hereafter we can therefore assume that formula_33 is even. It cannot be the case that formula_46, since this would imply formula_47, which would contradictorily imply that formula_48 would be the order of formula_28, which was already formula_33. At this point, it may or may not be the case that formula_51. If formula_30 does not divide formula_53, then this means that we are able to find a nontrivial factor of formula_1. We compute\nformula_55\nIf formula_56, then formula_51 was true, and a nontrivial factor of formula_1 cannot be achieved from formula_28, and the algorithm must restart with a new formula_28. Otherwise, we have found a nontrivial factor of formula_1, with the other being formula_62, and the algorithm is finished. For this step, it is also equivalent to compute formula_63; it will produce a nontrivial factor if formula_64 is nontrivial, and will not if it's trivial (where formula_51).\nThe algorithm restated shortly follows: let formula_1 be odd, and not a prime power. We want to output two nontrivial factors of formula_1.\nIt has been shown that this will be likely to succeed after a few runs. In practice, a single call to the quantum order-finding subroutine is enough to completely factor formula_30 with very high probability of success if one uses a more advanced reduction.\nQuantum order-finding subroutine.\nThe goal of the quantum subroutine of Shor's algorithm is, given coprime integers formula_1 and formula_84, to find the order formula_33 of formula_29 modulo formula_30, the smallest positive integer formula_33 such that formula_89. To achieve this, Shor's algorithm uses a quantum circuit involving two registers. The second register uses formula_90 qubits, where formula_90 is the smallest integer such that formula_92, i.e., formula_93. The size of the first register determines how accurate of an approximation the circuit produces. It can be shown that using formula_94 qubits gives sufficient accuracy to find formula_33. The exact quantum circuit depends on the parameters formula_29 and formula_30, which define the problem. The following description of the algorithm uses bra\u2013ket notation to denote quantum states, and formula_98 to denote the tensor product.\nThe algorithm consists of two main steps:\nThe connection with quantum phase estimation was not discussed in the original formulation of Shor's algorithm, but was later proposed by Alexei Kitaev.\nQuantum phase estimation.\nIn general the quantum phase estimation algorithm, for any unitary formula_99 and eigenstate formula_111 such that formula_112, sends input states formula_113 to output states close to formula_114, where formula_115 is a superposition of integers close to formula_116. In other words, it sends each eigenstate formula_117 of formula_99 to a state containing information close to the associated eigenvalue. For the purposes of quantum order-finding, we employ this strategy using the unitary defined by the action\nformula_119\nThe action of formula_99 on states formula_121 with formula_122 is not crucial to the functioning of the algorithm, but needs to be included to ensure that the overall transformation is a well-defined quantum gate. Implementing the circuit for quantum phase estimation with formula_99 requires being able to efficiently implement the gates formula_124. This can be accomplished via modular exponentiation, which is the slowest part of the algorithm.\nThe gate thus defined satisfies formula_125, which immediately implies that its eigenvalues are the formula_36-th roots of unity formula_127. Furthermore, each eigenvalue formula_128 has an eigenvector of the form formula_129, and these eigenvectors are such that\nformula_130\nwhere the last identity follows from the geometric series formula, which implies formula_131.\nUsing quantum phase estimation on an input state formula_132 would then return the integer formula_133 with high probability. More precisely, the quantum phase estimation circuit sends formula_132 to formula_135 such that the resulting probability distribution formula_136 is peaked around formula_137, with formula_138. This probability can be made arbitrarily close to 1 using extra qubits.\nApplying the above reasoning to the input formula_139, quantum phase estimation thus results in the evolution\nformula_140\nMeasuring the first register, we now have a balanced probability formula_141 to find each formula_142, each one giving an integer approximation to formula_143, which can be divided by formula_144 to get a decimal approximation for formula_145.\nContinued-fraction algorithm to retrieve the period.\nThen, we apply the continued-fraction algorithm to find integers formula_146 and formula_147, where formula_148 gives the best fraction approximation for the approximation measured from the circuit, for formula_149 and coprime formula_146 and formula_147. The number of qubits in the first register, formula_152, which determines the accuracy of the approximation, guarantees that\nformula_153\ngiven the best approximation from the superposition of formula_142 was measured (which can be made arbitrarily likely by using extra bits and truncating the output). However, while formula_146 and formula_147 are coprime, it may be the case that formula_157 and formula_36 are not coprime. Because of that, formula_146 and formula_147 may have lost some factors that were in formula_157 and formula_36. This can be remedied by rerunning the quantum order-finding subroutine an arbitrary number of times, to produce a list of fraction approximations\nformula_163\nwhere formula_164 is the number of times the subroutine was run. Each formula_165 will have different factors taken out of it because the circuit will (likely) have measured multiple different possible values of formula_157. To recover the actual formula_36 value, we can take the least common multiple of each formula_165:\nformula_169\nThe least common multiple will be the order formula_36 of the original integer formula_29 with high probability. In practice, a single run of the quantum order-finding subroutine is in general enough if more advanced post-processing is used.\nChoosing the size of the first register.\nPhase estimation requires choosing the size of the first register to determine the accuracy of the algorithm, and for the quantum subroutine of Shor's algorithm, formula_152 qubits is sufficient to guarantee that the optimal bitstring measured from phase estimation (meaning the formula_121 where formula_174 is the most accurate approximation of the phase from phase estimation) will allow the actual value of formula_36 to be recovered.\nEach formula_142 before measurement in Shor's algorithm represents a superposition of integers approximating formula_143. Let formula_121 represent the most optimal integer in formula_142. The following theorem guarantees that the continued fractions algorithm will recover formula_145 from formula_181:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTheorem\u2014If formula_157 and formula_36 are formula_104 bit integers, and\nformula_185\nthen the continued fractions algorithm run on formula_115 will recover both formula_187 and formula_188.\n As formula_189 is the optimal bitstring from phase estimation, formula_181 is accurate to formula_145 by formula_152 bits. Thus,formula_193which implies that the continued fractions algorithm will recover formula_157 and formula_36 (or with their greatest common divisor taken out).\nThe bottleneck.\nThe runtime bottleneck of Shor's algorithm is quantum modular exponentiation, which is by far slower than the quantum Fourier transform and classical pre-/post-processing. There are several approaches to constructing and optimizing circuits for modular exponentiation. The simplest and (currently) most practical approach is to mimic conventional arithmetic circuits with reversible gates, starting with ripple-carry adders. Knowing the base and the modulus of exponentiation facilitates further optimizations. Reversible circuits typically use on the order of formula_196 gates for formula_104 qubits. Alternative techniques asymptotically improve gate counts by using quantum Fourier transforms, but are not competitive with fewer than 600 qubits owing to high constants.\nPeriod finding and discrete logarithms.\nShor's algorithms for the discrete log and the order finding problems are instances of an algorithm solving the period finding problem. All three are instances of the hidden subgroup problem.\nShor's algorithm for discrete logarithms.\nGiven a group formula_198 with order formula_13 and generator formula_200, suppose we know that formula_201, for some formula_202, and we wish to compute formula_33, which is the discrete logarithm: formula_204. Consider the abelian group formula_205, where each factor corresponds to modular addition of values. Now, consider the function\nformula_206\nThis gives us an abelian hidden subgroup problem, where formula_207 corresponds to a group homomorphism. The kernel corresponds to the multiples of formula_208. So, if we can find the kernel, we can find formula_33. A quantum algorithm for solving this problem exists. This algorithm is, like the factor-finding algorithm, due to Peter Shor and both are implemented by creating a superposition through using Hadamard gates, followed by implementing formula_207 as a quantum transform, followed finally by a quantum Fourier transform. Due to this, the quantum algorithm for computing the discrete logarithm is also occasionally referred to as \"Shor's Algorithm.\"\nThe order-finding problem can also be viewed as a hidden subgroup problem. To see this, consider the group of integers under addition, and for a given formula_211 such that: formula_212, the function\nformula_213\nFor any finite abelian group formula_198, a quantum algorithm exists for solving the hidden subgroup for formula_198 in polynomial time.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The vast majority of molds are not hazardous to humans, and reaction to molds can vary between individuals, with relatively minor allergic reactions being the most common. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported in its June 2006 report, 'Mold Prevention Strategies and Possible Health Effects in the Aftermath of Hurricanes and Major Floods,' that \"excessive exposure to mold-contaminated materials can cause adverse health effects in susceptible persons regardless of the type of mold or the extent of contamination.\" When mold spores are present in abnormally high quantities, they can present especially hazardous health risks to humans after prolonged exposure, including allergic reactions or poisoning by mycotoxins, or causing fungal infection (mycosis).\nHealth effects.\nPeople who are atopic (sensitive), already have allergies, asthma, or compromised immune systems and occupy damp or moldy buildings are at an increased risk of health problems such as inflammatory responses to mold spores, metabolites such as mycotoxins, and other components. Other problems are respiratory and/or immune system responses including respiratory symptoms, respiratory infections, exacerbation of asthma, and rarely hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic alveolitis, chronic rhinosinusitis and allergic fungal sinusitis. A person's reaction to mold depends on their sensitivity and other health conditions, the amount of mold present, length of exposure, and the type of mold or mold products.\nThe five most common genera of indoor molds are \"Cladosporium\", \"Penicillium\", \"Aspergillus\", \"Alternaria\", and \"Trichoderma\".\nDamp environments that allow mold to grow can also allow the proliferation of bacteria and release volatile organic compounds.\nSymptoms of mold exposure.\nSymptoms of mold exposure can include:\nHealth effects linking to asthma.\nAdverse respiratory health effects are associated with occupancy in buildings with moisture and mold damage. Infants in homes with mold have a much greater risk of developing asthma and allergic rhinitis. Infants may develop respiratory symptoms due to exposure to a specific type of fungal mold, called \"Penicillium\". Signs that an infant may have mold-related respiratory problems include (but are not limited to) a persistent cough and wheeze. Increased exposure increases the probability of developing respiratory symptoms during their first year of life. As many as 21% of asthma cases may result from exposure to mold.\nMold exposures have a variety of health effects depending on the person. Some people are more sensitive to mold than others. Exposure to mold can cause several health issues such as; throat irritation, nasal stuffiness, eye irritation, cough, and wheezing, as well as skin irritation in some cases. Exposure to mold may also cause heightened sensitivity depending on the time and nature of exposure. People at higher risk for mold allergies are people with chronic lung illnesses and weak immune systems, which can often result in more severe reactions when exposed to mold.\nThere has been sufficient evidence that damp indoor environments are correlated with upper respiratory tract symptoms such as coughing, and wheezing in people with asthma.\nFlood-specific mold health effects.\nAmong children and adolescents, the most common health effect post-flooding was lower respiratory tract symptoms, though there was a lack of association with measurements of total fungi. Another study found that these respiratory symptoms were positively associated with exposure to water damaged homes, exposure included being inside without participating in clean up. Despite lower respiratory effects among all children, there was a significant difference in health outcomes between children with pre-existing conditions and children without. Children with pre-existing conditions were at greater risk that can likely be attributed to the greater disruption of care in the face of flooding and natural disaster.\nAlthough mold is the primary focus post flooding for residents, the effects of dampness alone must also be considered. According to the Institute of Medicine, there is a significant association between dampness in the home and wheeze, cough, and upper respiratory symptoms. A later analysis determined that 30% to 50% of asthma-related health outcomes are associated with not only mold, but also dampness in buildings.\nWhile there is a proven correlation between mold exposure and the development of upper and lower respiratory syndromes, there are still fewer incidences of negative health effects than one might expect. Barbeau and colleagues suggested that studies do not show a greater impact from mold exposure for several reasons: 1) the types of health effects are not severe and are therefore not caught; 2) people whose homes have flooded find alternative housing to prevent exposure; 3) self-selection, the healthier people participated in mold clean-up and were less likely to get sick; 4) exposures were time-limited as result of remediation efforts and; 5) the lack of access to health care post-flooding may result in fewer illnesses being discovered and reported for their association with mold. There are also certain notable scientific limitations in studying the exposure effects of dampness and molds on individuals because there are currently no known biomarkers that can prove that a person was exclusively exposed to molds. Thus, it is currently impossible to prove correlation between mold exposure and symptoms.\nMold-associated conditions.\nHealth problems associated with high levels of airborne mold spores include allergic reactions, asthma episodes, irritations of the eye, nose and throat, sinus congestion, and other respiratory problems. Several studies and reviews have suggested that childhood exposure to dampness and mold might contribute to the development of asthma. For example, residents of homes with mold are at an elevated risk for both respiratory infections and bronchitis. When mold spores are inhaled by an immunocompromised individual, some mold spores may begin to grow on living tissue, attaching to cells along the respiratory tract and causing further problems. Generally, when this occurs, the illness is an epiphenomenon and not the primary pathology. Also, mold may produce mycotoxins, either before or after exposure to humans, potentially causing toxicity.\nFungal infection.\nA serious health threat from mold exposure for immunocompromised individuals is systemic fungal infection (systemic mycosis). Immunocompromised individuals exposed to high levels of mold, or individuals with chronic exposure may become infected. Sinuses and digestive tract infections are most common; lung and skin infections are also possible. Mycotoxins may or may not be produced by the invading mold.\nDermatophytes are the parasitic fungi that cause skin infections such as athlete's foot and tinea cruris. Most dermatophyte fungi take the form of mold, as opposed to a yeast, with an appearance (when cultured) that is similar to other molds.\nOpportunistic infection by molds such as \"Talaromyces marneffei\" and \"Aspergillus fumigatus\" is a common cause of illness and death among immunocompromised people, including people with AIDS or asthma.\nMold-induced hypersensitivity.\nThe most common form of hypersensitivity is caused by the direct exposure to inhaled mold spores that can be dead or alive or hyphal fragments which can lead to allergic asthma or allergic rhinitis. The most common effects are rhinorrhea (runny nose), watery eyes, coughing and asthma attacks. Another form of hypersensitivity is hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Exposure can occur at home, at work or in other settings. It is predicted that about 5% of people have some airway symptoms due to allergic reactions to molds in their lifetimes.\nHypersensitivity may also be a reaction toward an established fungal infection in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.\nMycotoxin toxicity.\nMolds excrete toxic compounds called mycotoxins, secondary metabolites produced by fungi under certain environmental conditions. These environmental conditions affect the production of mycotoxins at the transcription level. Temperature, water activity and pH, strongly influence mycotoxin biosynthesis by increasing the level of transcription within the fungal spore. It has also been found that low levels of fungicides can boost mycotoxin synthesis. Mycotoxins can be harmful or lethal to humans and animals when exposure is high enough.\nExtreme exposure to very high levels of mycotoxins can lead to neurological problems and, in some cases, death; fortunately, such exposures rarely to never occur in normal exposure scenarios, even in residences with serious mold problems. Prolonged exposure, such as daily workplace exposure, can be particularly harmful.\nIt is thought that all molds may produce mycotoxins, and thus all molds may be potentially toxic if large enough quantities are ingested, or the human becomes exposed to extreme quantities of mold. Mycotoxins are not produced all the time, but only under specific growing conditions. Mycotoxins are harmful or lethal to humans and animals.\nMycotoxins can be found on the mold spore and mold fragments, and therefore they can also be found on the substrate upon which the mold grows. Routes of entry for these insults can include ingestion, dermal exposure, and inhalation.\nAflatoxin is an example of a mycotoxin. It is a cancer-causing poison produced by certain fungi in or on foods and feeds, especially in field corn and peanuts.\nExposure sources and prevention.\nThe primary sources of mold exposure are from the indoor air in buildings with substantial mold growth and the ingestion of food with mold growths.\nAir.\nWhile mold and related microbial agents can be found both inside and outside, specific factors can lead to significantly higher levels of these microbes, creating a potential health hazard. Several notable factors are water damage in buildings, the use of building materials which provide a suitable substrate and source of food to amplify mold growth, relative humidity, and energy-efficient building designs, which can prevent proper circulation of outside air and create a unique ecology in the built environment. A common reason for mold hazards in the household can be the placement of furniture, which may result in a lack of ventilation of the nearby wall. The simplest method of avoiding mold in a home so affected is to move the furniture in question.\nMore than half of adult workers in moldy/humid buildings suffer from nasal or sinus symptoms due to mold exposure.\nPrevention of mold exposure and its ensuing health issues begins with the prevention of mold growth in the first place by avoiding a mold-supporting environment. Extensive flooding and water damage can support extensive mold growth. Following hurricanes, homes with greater flood damage, especially those with more than of indoor flooding, demonstrated far higher levels of mold growth compared with homes with little or no flooding.\nIt is useful to perform an assessment of the location and extent of the mold hazard in a structure. Various practices of remediation can be followed to mitigate mold issues in buildings, the most important of which is to reduce moisture levels. Removal of affected materials after the source of moisture has been reduced and/or eliminated may be necessary, as some materials cannot be remediated. Thus, the concept of mold growth, assessment, and remediation is essential in preventing health issues arising due to the presence of dampness and mold.\nMolds may excrete liquids or low-volatility gases, but the concentrations are so low that frequently they cannot be detected even with sensitive analytical sampling techniques. Sometimes, these by-products are detectable by odor, in which case they are referred to as \"ergonomic odors\", meaning the odors are noticeable but do not indicate toxicologically significant exposures.\nFood.\nMolds that are often found on meat and poultry include members of the genera \"Alternaria\", \"Aspergillus\", \"Botrytis\", \"Cladosporium\", \"Fusarium\", \"Geotrichum\", \"Mortierella\", \"Mucor\", \"Neurospora\", \"Paecilomyces\", \"Penicillium\", and \"Rhizopus\". Grain crops in particular incur considerable losses both in field and storage due to pathogens, post-harvest spoilage, and insect damage. A number of common microfungi are important agents of post-harvest spoilage, notably members of the genera \"Aspergillus\", \"Fusarium\", and \"Penicillium\". A number of these produce mycotoxins (soluble, non-volatile toxins produced by a range of microfungi that demonstrate specific and potent toxic properties on human and animal cells) that can render foods unfit for consumption. When ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through skin, mycotoxins may cause or contribute to a range of effects from reduced appetite and general malaise to acute illness or death in rare cases. Mycotoxins may also contribute to cancer. Dietary exposure to the mycotoxin aflatoxin B1, commonly produced by growth of the fungus \"Aspergillus flavus\" on improperly stored ground nuts in many areas of the developing world, is known to independently (and synergistically with Hepatitis B virus) induce liver cancer. Mycotoxin-contaminated grain and other food products have a significant impact on human and animal health globally. According to the World Health Organization, roughly 25% of the world's food may be contaminated by mycotoxins.\nPrevention of mold exposure from food is generally to consume food that has no mold growths on it. Also, mold growth in the first place can be prevented by the same concept of mold growth, assessment, and remediation that prevents air exposure. Also, it is especially useful to clean the inside of the refrigerator and to ensure dishcloths, towels, sponges, and mops are clean.\nRuminants are considered to have increased resistance to some mycotoxins, presumably due to the superior mycotoxin-degrading capabilities of their gut microbiota. The passage of mycotoxins through the food chain may also have important consequences on human health. For example, in China in December 2011, high levels of carcinogen aflatoxin M1 in Mengniu brand milk were found to be associated with the consumption of mold-contaminated feed by dairy cattle.\nBedding.\nBacteria, fungi, allergens, and particle-bound semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) can all be found in bedding and pillows with possible consequences for human health given the high amount of exposure each day. Over 47 species of fungi have been identified in pillows, although the typical range of species found in a single pillow varied between four and sixteen. Compared to feather pillows, synthetic pillows typically display a slightly greater variety of fungal species and significantly higher levels of \u03b2\u2010(1,3)\u2010glucan, which can cause inflammatory responses. The authors concluded that these and related results suggest feather bedding might be a more appropriate choice for asthmatics than synthetics. Some newer bedding products incorporate silver nanoparticles due to their antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral properties; however, the long-term safety of this additional exposure to these nanoparticles is relatively unknown, and a conservative approach to the use of these products is recommended.\nFlooding.\nFlooding in houses causes a unique opportunity for mold growth, which may be attributed to adverse health effects in people exposed to the mold, especially children and adolescents. In a study on the health effects of mold exposure after hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the predominant types of mold were \"Aspergillus\", \"Penicillium\", and \"Cladosporium\" with indoor spore counts ranging from 6,142 \u2013 735,123 spores\u00a0m\u22123. Molds isolated following flooding were different from mold previously reported for non-water damaged homes in the area. Further research found that homes with greater than three feet of indoor flooding demonstrated significantly higher levels of mold than those with little or no flooding.\nMitigation.\nRecommended strategies to prevent mold include avoiding mold-contamination; utilization of environmental controls; the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), including skin, eye, and respiratory protection; and environmental controls such as ventilation and suppression of dust. When mold cannot be prevented, the CDC recommends clean-up protocol including first taking emergency action to stop water intrusion. Second, they recommend determining the extent of water damage and mold contamination. And third, they recommend planning remediation activities such as establishing containment and protection for workers and occupants; eliminating water or moisture sources if possible; decontaminating or removing damaged materials and drying any wet materials; evaluating whether space has been successfully remediated; and reassembling the space to control sources of moisture.\nHistory.\nIn 1698, the physician Sir John Floyer published the first edition of \"A Treatise of the Asthma\", the first English textbook on the malady. In it, he describes how dampness and mold could trigger an asthmatic attack, specifically, \"damp houses and fenny [boggy] countries\". He also writes of an asthmatic \"who fell into a violent fit by going into a Wine-Cellar\", presumably due to the \"fumes\" in the air.\nIn the 1930s, mold was identified as the cause behind the mysterious deaths of farm animals in Russia and other countries. \"Stachybotrys chartarum\" was found growing on the wet grain used for animal feed. Illness and death also occurred in humans when starving peasants ate large quantities of rotten food grains and cereals heavily overgrown with the \"Stachybotrys\" mold.\nIn the 1970s, building construction techniques changed in response to changing economic realities, including the energy crisis. As a result, homes, and buildings became more airtight. Also, cheaper materials such as drywall came into common use. The newer building materials reduced the drying potential of the structures, making moisture problems more prevalent. This combination of increased moisture and suitable substrates contributed to increased mold growth inside buildings.\nIn November 2022, a UK coroner recorded that a two-year-old child, Awaab Ishak from Rochdale, England, died in 2020 of \"acute airway oedema with severe granulomatous tracheobronchitis due to environmental mould exposure\" in his home. While not specified in the coroner's report or outputs from official proceedings, the death was widely reported as due to specifically 'toxic' or 'toxic black' mold. The finding led to a 2023 change in UK law, known as Awaab's Law, which will require social housing providers to remedy reported damp and mould within certain time limits.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "42677", "revid": "50697639", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42677", "title": "Celtic Tiger", "text": "Irish economy between 1995 and 2007\nThe \"Celtic Tiger\" () is a term referring to the economy of Ireland from the mid-1990s to the end of the first decade of the 2000s, a period of rapid real economic growth fuelled by foreign direct investment. The boom was dampened by a subsequent property bubble which resulted in a severe economic downturn.\nAt the start of the 1990s, Ireland was a relatively poor country by Western European standards, with high poverty, high unemployment, inflation, and low economic growth. The Irish economy expanded at an average rate of 9.4% between 1995 and 2000, and continued to grow at an average rate of 5.9% during the following decade until 2008, when it fell into recession. Ireland's rapid economic growth has been described as a rare example of a Western country matching the growth of East Asian nations, i.e. the 'Four Asian Tigers'.\nThe economy underwent a dramatic reversal from 2008, affected by the Great Recession and ensuing European debt crisis, with GDP contracting by 14% and unemployment levels rising to 14% by 2011. The recession lasted until 2014. In 2015, the economy posted a growth rate of 6.7% marked the beginning of a new period of strong economic growth.\nTerm.\nThe colloquial term \"Celtic Tiger\" has been used to refer to the country itself, and to the years associated with the boom. The first recorded use of the phrase is in a 1994 Morgan Stanley report by Kevin Gardiner. The term refers to Ireland's similarity to the East Asian Tigers: Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan during their periods of rapid growth between the early 1960s and late 1990s. \"An T\u00edogar Ceilteach\", the Irish language version of the term, appears in the Foras na Gaeilge terminology database and has been used in government and administrative contexts since at least 2005.\nThe Celtic Tiger period has also been called \"The Boom\" or \"Ireland's Economic Miracle\". During that time, the country experienced a period of economic growth that transformed it from one of Western Europe's poorer countries into one of its wealthiest. The causes of Ireland's growth are the subject of some debate, but credit has been primarily given to state-driven economic development; social partnership among employers, government and trade unions; increased participation by women in the labour force; decades of investment in domestic higher education; targeting of foreign direct investment; a low corporation tax rate; an English-speaking workforce; and membership of the European Union, which provided transfer payments and export access to the Single Market.\nDuring the 2008 financial crisis, the Celtic Tiger had all but died. Some critics, such as David McWilliams, who had been warning about impending collapse for some time, concluded: \"The case is clear: an economically challenged government, perniciously influenced by the interests of the housing lobby, blew it. The entire Irish episode will be studied internationally in years to come as an example of how not to do things.\"\nHistorian Richard Aldous stated the Celtic Tiger has now gone the \"way of the dodo\". In early 2008, many commentators thought a soft landing was likely, but by January 2009, it seemed possible the country could experience a depression. In early January 2009, \"The Irish Times\", in an editorial, declared:\n\"We have gone from the Celtic Tiger to an era of financial fear with the suddenness of a \"Titanic\"-style shipwreck, thrown from comfort, even luxury, into a cold sea of uncertainty.\" In February 2010, a report by Davy Research concluded that Ireland had \"largely wasted\u201d its years of high income during the boom, with private enterprise investing its wealth \"in the wrong places\". It compared Ireland's growth to other small eurozone countries such as Finland and Belgium\u00a0\u2013 noting that the physical wealth of those countries exceeds that of Ireland because of their \"vastly superior\" transport infrastructure, telecommunications network, and public services.\nTiger economy.\nFrom 1995 to 2000, GDP growth rate ranged between 7.8 and 11.5%; it then slowed to between 4.4 and 6.5% from 2001 to 2007. During that period, the Irish GDP per capita rose dramatically to equal, then eventually surpass, that of all but one state in Western Europe. Although GDP does not represent the standard of living, and the GNP remained lower than the GDP, in 2007, the GNP achieved the same level as of some other Western European countries'. \nCauses.\nHistorian R. F. Foster argues the cause was a combination of a new sense of initiative and the entry of American corporations such as Intel. He concludes the chief factors were low taxation, pro-business regulatory policies, and a young, tech-savvy workforce. For many multinationals, the decision to do business in Ireland was made easier still by generous incentives from the Industrial Development Authority. In addition European Union membership was helpful, giving the country lucrative access to markets that it had previously reached only through the United Kingdom, and pumping huge subsidies and investment capital into the Irish economy. Frederic Mishkin has also suggested that the economic boom partly resulted from the austerity plan of Charles Haughey (Taoiseach from 1987 to 1992). People and businesses expected a stable economy, boosting their confidence to spend and invest due to anticipated stability in output.\nTax policy.\nMany economists credit Ireland's growth to a low corporate taxation rate (10 to 12.5% throughout the late 1990s). Since 1956, successive Irish governments have pursued low-taxation policies.\nEuropean Union Structural and Cohesion Funds.\nSince joining the EU in 1973, Ireland has received over \u20ac17 billion in EU Structural and Cohesion Funds. These are made up of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) and were used to increase investment in the education system and to build physical infrastructure. These transfer payments from members of the European Union, such as Germany and France, were as high as 4% of Ireland's gross national product (GNP). Ireland is unique among cohesion countries, having allocated up to 35% of its Structural Funds to human resource investments, compared with an average of around 25% for other cohesion fund recipients. The Irish economy's increased productive capacity is sometimes attributed to these investments, which made Ireland more attractive to high-tech businesses, though the libertarian Cato Institute has suggested that the EU transfer payments were economically inefficient and may have actually slowed growth. The conservative Heritage Foundation also attributed to transfer payments no significant role in causing growth.\nTrade within the European Union.\nIreland's membership in the EU since 1973 helped the country gain access to Europe's large markets. Ireland's trade had previously been predominantly with the United Kingdom.\nIndustrial policies.\nIn the 1990s, the provision of subsidies and investment capital by Irish state organisations (such as IDA Ireland) encouraged high-profile companies, such as Dell, Intel, and Microsoft, to locate in Ireland; these companies were attracted to Ireland because of its EU membership, relatively low wages, government grants, and low tax rates. Enterprise Ireland, a state agency, provides financial, technical, and social support to start-up businesses. Additionally, the building of the International Financial Services Centre in Dublin led to the creation of 14,000 high-value jobs in the accounting, legal, and financial management sectors.\nIn July 2003, the government established the Science Foundation Ireland on a statutory basis to promote education for highly skilled careers, particularly in biotechnology and information and communications technology, with the additional purpose to invest in science initiatives that aim to further Ireland's knowledge economy.\nGeography and demographics.\nThe time zone difference allows Irish and British employees to work the first part of each day while US workers sleep. US firms were drawn to Ireland by cheap wage costs compared to the UK, and by the limited government intervention in business compared to other EU members, and particularly to countries in Eastern Europe. Growing stability in Northern Ireland brought about by the Good Friday Agreement further established Ireland's ability to provide a stable business environment.\nIrish workers can communicate effectively with Americans\u00a0\u2013 especially compared to those in other low-wage, non-English-speaking EU nations, such as Portugal and Spain; this factor was vital to U.S. companies' choosing Ireland for their European headquarters. It has also been argued that the demographic dividend from the rising ratio of workers to dependents due to falling fertility, and increased female labour market participation, increased income per capita.\nImpact of economic growth.\nIreland was transformed from one of the poorest countries in Western Europe to one of the wealthiest. Disposable income soared to record levels, enabling a huge rise in consumer spending with foreign holidays accounting for over 91% of total holiday expenditure in 2004. However, the gap between the highest and lowest income households widened in the five-year period to 2004\u20132005; in response, the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) stated in 2002: \"On balance, budgets over the past 10 to 20 years have been more favourable to high income groups than low income groups, but particularly so during periods of high growth\". Unemployment fell from 18% in the late 1980s to 4.5% by the end of 2007, and average industrial wages grew at one of the highest rates in Europe. Inflation brushed 5% per annum towards the end of the \"Tiger\" period, pushing Irish prices up to those of Nordic Europe, even though wage rates are roughly the same as in the UK. The national debt had remained constant during the boom, but the GDP to debt ratio rose, due to the dramatic rise in GDP.\nThe new wealth resulted in large investments in modernising Irish infrastructure and cities. The National Development Plan led to improvements in roads, and new transport services were developed, such as the Luas light rail lines, the Dublin Port Tunnel, and the extension of the Cork Suburban Rail. Local authorities enhanced city streets and built monuments such as the Spire of Dublin. An academic said in 2008 that the jumbo breakfast roll became \"perhaps the ultimate symbol of our contemporary Celtic Tigerland\", product of Irish conglomerate IAWS and eaten by busy workers buying food in filling station convenience stores.\nIreland's trend of net emigration was reversed as the republic became a destination for immigrants. This significantly changed Irish demographics and resulted in expanding multiculturalism, particularly in the Dublin, Cork, Limerick, and Galway areas. It was estimated in 2007 that 10% of Irish residents were foreign-born; most of the new arrivals were citizens of Poland and the Baltic states, many of whom found work in the retail and service sectors. A study conducted in 2006 found that many Irish people regarded immigration as an important factor for economic progress. Within Ireland, many young people left the rural countryside to live and work in urban centres.\nMany people in Ireland believe that the growing consumerism during the boom years eroded the country's culture, with the adoption of American capitalist ideals. While Ireland's historical economic ties to the UK had often been the subject of criticism, Peader Kirby argued that the new ties to the US economy were met with a \"satisfied silence\". Nevertheless, voices on the political left have decried the \"closer to Boston than Berlin\" philosophy of the Fianna F\u00e1il-Progressive Democrat government. Writers such as William Wall, Mike McCormick, and Gerry Murphy have satirised these developments. Growing wealth was blamed for rising crime levels among youths, particularly alcohol-related violence resulting from increased spending power. However, it was also accompanied by rapidly increased life expectancy and very high quality of life ratings; the country ranked first in \"The Economist\"'s 2005 quality of life index, dropping to 12th by 2013.\nThe growing success of Ireland's economy encouraged entrepreneurship and risk-taking, qualities that had been dormant during poor economic periods. However, whilst some semblance of a culture of entrepreneurship exists, foreign-owned companies account for 93% of Ireland's exports.\nSlowdown in growth, 2001\u20132003.\nThe Celtic Tiger's growth slowed along with the slowing in the world economy in 2002 after seven years of high growth.\nThe economy was adversely affected by a large reduction in investment in the worldwide information technology (IT) industry. The industry had over-expanded in the late 1990s, and its stock market equity declined sharply. Ireland was a major player in the IT industry: in 2002, it had exported US$10.4 billion worth of computer services, compared to $6.9 billion from the US. Ireland accounted for approximately 50% of all mass-market packaged software sold in Europe in 2002 (OECD, 2002; OECD, 2004).\nFoot and mouth disease and the 11 September 2001 attacks damaged Ireland's tourism and agricultural sectors , deterring U.S. and British tourists. Several companies moved operations to Eastern Europe and the People's Republic of China because of a rise in Irish wage costs, insurance premiums, and a general reduction in Ireland's economic competitiveness. The rising value of the Euro hit non-EMU exports, particularly those to the U.S. and the United Kingdom.\nAt the same time, economies globally experienced a slowdown. The US economy grew only 0.3% in April, May, and June 2002 from a year earlier, and the Federal Reserve made 11 rate cuts that year in an attempt to stimulate the US economy. The EU scarcely grew throughout the whole of 2002, and many members' governments (notably in Germany and France) lost control of public finances, causing large deficits that broke the terms of the EMU Stability and Growth Pact.\nThe economic downturn in Ireland was not a recession but a slowdown in the rate of economic expansion. Signs of a recovery became evident in late 2003, as US investment levels increased once again. Many senior economists have heavily criticised the government for the economic imbalance in favour of the construction industry, and the prospect of sustaining economic growth in the future.\nPost-2003 resurgence.\nAfter the slowdown in 2001 and 2002, Irish economic growth began to accelerate again in late 2003 and 2004. Some of the media considered that an opportunity to document the return of the Celtic Tiger\u00a0\u2013 occasionally referred to in the press as the \"Celtic Tiger 2\" and \"Celtic Tiger Mark 2\". In 2004, Irish growth was the highest, at 4.5%, of the EU-15 states, and a similar figure was forecast for 2005. Those rates contrast with growth rates of 1% to 3% for many other European economies, including France, Germany, and Italy. The pace of expansion in lending to households from 2003 to 2007 was among the highest in the euro area\nIn 2006, there was a surge in Foreign Direct Investment and a net increase of 3,795 in IDA supported jobs, with International and Financial Services having the highest growth rate. The reasons for the continuation of the Irish economic boom were somewhat controversial within Ireland. Some Economists, Civil Rights Activists and Social Commentators have said that the growth throughout this period was merely due to a great increase in property values, and to catch-up growth in employment in the construction sector.\nGlobally, the U.S. recovery boosted Ireland's economy due to Ireland's close economic ties to the US. The decline in tourism as a result of foot and mouth disease and the 11 September 2001 attacks had reversed itself. The recovery of the global information technology industry was also a factor; Ireland produced 25% of all European PCs, and Apple, Dell (whose major European manufacturing plant was in Limerick), HP, and IBM all had sizeable Irish operations.\nThere had been a renewed investment by multinational firms. Intel had resumed its Irish expansion, Google created an office in Dublin, Abbott Laboratories was building a new Irish facility, and Bell Labs planned to open a future facility.\nDomestically, a new state body, Science Foundation Ireland, was established to promote new science companies in Ireland Maturing funds from the SSIA government savings scheme relaxed consumers' concerns about spending and thus fueled retail sales growth.\nIn September 2009, T\u00e1naiste Mary Coughlan said Ireland had lost ground in international competitiveness every year since 2000.\nChallenges.\nProperty market.\nThe return of the boom in 2004 was claimed to be primarily the result of the large construction sector's catching up with the demand caused by the first boom. The construction sector represented nearly 12% of GDP and a large proportion of employment among young, unskilled men. A number of sources, including \"The Economist,\" warned of excessive Irish property values. 2004 saw the construction of 80,000 new homes, compared to the UK's 160,000\u00a0\u2013 a nation that has 15 times Ireland's population. House prices doubled between 2000 and 2006; tax incentives were a key driver of this price rise, and the Fianna F\u00e1il-Progressive Democrats government subsequently received substantial criticism for these policies.\nIn January 2009, UCD economist Morgan Kelly predicted that house prices would fall by 80% from peak to trough in real terms.\nLoss of competitiveness.\nRising wages, inflation, and excessive public spending led to a loss of competitiveness in the Irish economy. Irish wages were substantially above the EU average, particularly in the Dublin region, though many poorer Eastern European states had joined the EU since 2004, substantially lowering the average EU wage below its 1995 level. Low-paid sectors, such as retail and hospitality, remained below the EU-15 average, however. The pressures primarily affect unskilled, semi-skilled, and manufacturing jobs. Outsourcing of professional jobs also increased, with Poland in 2008 gaining several hundred former Irish jobs from the accountancy divisions of Philips and Dell.\nPromotion of indigenous industry.\nOne of the major challenges facing Ireland is the successful promotion of indigenous industry. Although Ireland boasted a few large international companies, such as AIB, CRH, \u00c9lan, Kerry Group, Ryanair, and Smurfit Kappa, there are few companies with over one billion euros in annual revenue. The government has charged Enterprise Ireland with the task of boosting Ireland's indigenous industry and launched a website in 2003 with the objective of streamlining and marketing the process of starting a business in Ireland.\nReliance on foreign energy sources.\nIreland relied on imported fossil fuels for over 80% of its energy in 2006. Ireland for many years in the middle twentieth century limited its dependence on external energy sources by developing its peat bogs, building various hydroelectric projects, including a dam at Ardnacrusha on the River Shannon in 1928, developing offshore gas fields, and diversifying into coal in the 1970s. As gas, peat, and hydroelectric power have been almost fully exploited in Ireland, there is a continuously increasing need for imported fossil fuels at a time of increasing concerns about security of supply and global warming. One solution is to develop alternative energy sources, including wind power and, to a lesser extent, wave power.\nAn offshore wind farm is currently under construction off the east coast near Arklow, and many remote locations in the west show potential for wind farm development. A report by Sustainable Energy Ireland indicated that if wind power were properly developed, Ireland could one day be exporting excess wind power if the natural difficulties of integrating wind power into the national grid are solved. Wind power by November 2009 already accounted for 15.4% of total installed generating capacity in the state. By 2020, the Irish government forecasts that 40% of the country's energy needs will come from renewable sources, well above the EU average.\nDistribution of wealth.\nIreland's new wealth is unevenly distributed. The United Nations reported in 2004 that Ireland was second only to the US in inequality among Western nations. There is some opposition to the theory that Ireland's wealth has been unusually unevenly distributed, among them economist and journalist David McWilliams. He cites Eurostat figures which indicate that Ireland is just above average in terms equality by one type of measurement. Moreover, Ireland's inequality persists by other measurements. According to an ESRI report published in December 2006, Ireland's child poverty level ranks 22nd out of the 26 richest countries, and it is the 2nd most unequal country in Europe.\nBanking scandals.\n\"The New York Times\" in 2005 described Ireland as the \"Wild West of European finance\", a perception that helped prompt the creation of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority. Despite its mandate for stricter oversight, the agency never imposed major sanctions on any Irish institution, even though Ireland had experienced several major banking scandals in overcharging of their customers. Industry representatives disputed the idea that Ireland may be home to unchecked financial frauds. In December 2008, irregularities in directors' loans that had been kept off one bank's balance sheet for eight years forced the resignation of the Financial Regulator. Economic commentator David McWilliams has described the collapse of Anglo Irish Bank as Ireland's Enron.\nContraction of the Tiger.\nIn an economic analysis, the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) on 24 June 2008 forecast the possibility the Irish economy would experience marginal negative growth in 2008. This would be the first time since 1983. Outlining possible prospects for the economy for 2008, the ESRI said output of goods and services might fall that year\u2014which would have been the Irish definition of a mild recession. It also predicted a recovery in 2009 and 2010.\nIn September 2008, Ireland became the first eurozone country to officially enter recession. The recession was confirmed by figures from the Central Statistics Office showing the bursting of the property bubble and a collapse in consumer spending that terminated the boom that was the Celtic Tiger. The figures show the gross domestic product (GDP), which measures the value of all the goods and services produced in the State, fell 0.8% in the second three months of 2008 compared with the same quarter of 2007. That was the second successive quarter of negative economic growth, which is one definition of a recession. The Celtic Tiger was declared dead by October 2008.\nIn a November 2008 interview in\" Hot Press,\" in a grim assessment of where Ireland stood, then Taoiseach Brian Cowen said many people still did not realise how badly shaken the public finances were.\nBy 30 January 2009, Ireland's government debt had become the riskiest in the euro zone, surpassing Greece's sovereign bonds, according to credit-default swap prices. In February 2009, Taoiseach Brian Cowen said that Ireland's economy appeared on course to contract by 6.5% in 2009.\nAftermath.\nFormer Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald blamed Ireland's dire economic state in 2009 on a series of \"calamitous\" government policy errors. Between the years of 2000 and 2003 the then Finance Minister Charlie McCreevy boosted public spending by 48% while cutting income tax. A second problem occurred when government policies allowed, or even encouraged, a housing bubble to develop, \"on an immense scale\". However, he wrote nothing of the impact of the European Central Bank's low interest rates which funded the property bubble and further exacerbated the overheating economy\nNobel laureate Paul Krugman had a bleak prediction,\n\"\u201cAs far as responding to the recession goes, Ireland appears to be really, truly without options, other than to hope for an export-led recovery, if and when the rest of the world bounces back.\u201d\"\nThe International Monetary Fund in mid-April 2009 forecast a very poor outlook for Ireland. It projected that the Irish economy would contract by 8 per cent in 2009 and by 3 per cent in 2010\u00a0\u2013 and that might be on the optimistic side.\nOn 19 November 2010, the Irish government began talks on a multibillion-dollar economic assistance package with experts from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Union. Unemployment in Ireland was forecasted to rise almost 17 per cent in 2010, the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) stated in a report published on 28 April 2009, however, the unemployment rate in 2010 steadied at 14%. In 2010, the unemployment rate was at 14.8 per cent, and in order to escape economic downfall, Ireland requested \u20ac67.5 billion ($85.7 billion) from the International Monetary Fund and members of the euro area. Taking the money meant accepting austerity.\nThe economic contraction in Ireland ended in 2015, when the economy began growing. The economy began outpacing the rest of the European Union after this period. The economy of Ireland continued to grow in 2022 rising by 11%, although projected to slow.\nCultural impact.\nThe Celtic Tiger had more than just an economic impact, impacting also Ireland's social backdrop. 2007 research by the Economic and Social Research Institute, prior to the crash, found that fears over wider social inequality, declining community life, and a more selfish, materialist approach to life were largely unfounded, and that the social impact of the Celtic Tiger had largely been positive. The economic boom led to lower levels of emigration and higher immigration than had historically been the case, while the government of the time acknowledged the continuing strain on some public services and that the \"provision of social housing, childcare and the integration of newcomers\" remained political priorities.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nhttp://"}

{"id": "42691", "revid": "2846386", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42691", "title": "Andr\u00e9 Malraux", "text": "French novelist, art theorist, and statesman (1901\u20131976)\nGeorges Andr\u00e9 Malraux ( ; ; 3 November 1901 \u2013 23 November 1976) was a French novelist, member of the French Resistance, art theorist, and minister of cultural affairs. Malraux's novel \"La Condition Humaine\" (\"Man's Fate\") (1933) is set during the 1927 Shanghai uprising and won the Prix Goncourt; \"L'Espoir\" (\"Man's Hope\", 1937) arose from his experiences during the Spanish Civil War. After the Second World War he abandoned fiction and wrote several works on art history, collected as \"La Psychologie de l'Art\" (\"The Voices of Silence\", 1953). He was appointed by President Charles de Gaulle as information minister (1945\u201346) and subsequently as France's first cultural affairs minister during de Gaulle's presidency (1959\u20131969).\nEarly years.\nMalraux was born in Paris in 1901, the son of Fernand-Georges Malraux (1875\u20131930) and Berthe F\u00e9licie Lamy (1877\u20131932). His parents separated in 1905 and eventually divorced. There are suggestions that Malraux's paternal grandfather committed suicide in 1909.\nMalraux was raised by his mother, his maternal aunt Marie Lamy and his maternal grandmother, Adrienne Lamy (n\u00e9e Romagna), who had a grocery store in the small town of Bondy (Seine-Saint-Denis). His father, a stockbroker, died by suicide in 1930 after the international crash of the stock market and onset of the Great Depression. \nFrom his childhood, associates noticed that Andr\u00e9 had marked nervousness and motor and vocal tics. The recent biographer Olivier Todd, who published a book on Malraux in 2005, suggests that he had Tourette syndrome, although that has not been confirmed. The young Malraux left formal education early, but he followed his curiosity through the booksellers and museums in Paris, and explored the city's rich libraries as well.\nCareer.\nEarly years.\nMalraux's first published work, an article entitled \"The Origins of Cubist Poetry\", appeared in Florent Fels' magazine \"Action\" in 1920. This was followed in 1921 by three semi-surrealist tales, one of which, \"Paper Moons\", was illustrated by Fernand L\u00e9ger. Malraux also frequented the Parisian artistic and literary milieux of the period, meeting figures such as Demetrios Galanis, Max Jacob, Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac, Guy de Pourtal\u00e8s, Andr\u00e9 Salmon, Jean Cocteau, Raymond Radiguet, Florent Fels, Pascal Pia, Marcel Arland, Edmond Jaloux, and Pierre Mac Orlan. In 1922, Malraux married Clara Goldschmidt. Malraux and his first wife separated in 1938 but did not divorce until 1947. His daughter from this marriage, Florence (b. 1933), married the filmmaker Alain Resnais. By the age of twenty, Malraux was reading the work of the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche who was to remain a major influence on him for the rest of his life. Malraux was especially impressed with Nietzsche's theory of a world in continuous turmoil and his statement \"that the individual himself is still the most recent creation\" who was completely responsible for all of his actions. Most of all, Malraux embraced Nietzsche's theory of the \"\u00dcbermensch\", the heroic, exalted man who would create great works of art and whose will would allow him to triumph over anything.\nIndochina.\nT. E. Lawrence, aka \"Lawrence of Arabia\", has a reputation in France as the man who was supposedly responsible for France's troubles in Syria in the 1920s. An exception was Malraux who regarded Lawrence as a role model, the intellectual-cum-man-of-action and the romantic, enigmatic hero. Malraux often admitted to having a \"certain fascination\" with Lawrence, and it has been suggested that Malraux's sudden decision to abandon the Surrealist literary scene in Paris for adventure in the Far East was prompted by a desire to emulate Lawrence who began his career as an archaeologist in the Ottoman Empire excavating the ruins of the ancient city of Carchemish in the \"vilayet\" of Aleppo in what is now modern Syria. As Lawrence had first made his reputation in the Near East digging up the ruins of an ancient civilization, it was only natural that Malraux should go to the Far East to likewise make his reputation in Asia digging up ancient ruins. Lawrence considered himself a writer first and foremost while also presenting himself as a man of action, the \"Nietzschean\" hero who triumphs over both the environment and men through the force of his will, a persona that Malraux consciously imitated. Malraux often wrote about Lawrence, whom he described admiringly as a man with a need for \"the absolute\", for whom no compromises were possible and for whom going all the way was the only way. Along the same lines, Malraux argued that Lawrence should not be remembered mainly as a guerrilla leader in the Arab Revolt and the British liaison officer with the Emir Faisal, but rather as a romantic, lyrical writer as writing was Lawrence's first passion, which also described Malraux very well. Although Malraux courted fame through his novels, poems and essays on art in combination with his adventures and political activism, he was an intensely shy and private man who kept to himself, maintaining a distance between himself and others. Malraux's reticence led his first wife Clara to later say she barely knew him during their marriage.\nIn 1923, aged 22, Malraux and Clara left for the French Protectorate of Cambodia. Angkor Wat is a huge 12th century temple situated in the old capital of the Khmer Empire. Angkor (Yasodharapura) was \"the world's largest urban settlement\" in the 11th and 12th centuries supported by an elaborate network of canals and roads across mainland Southeast Asia before decaying and falling into the jungle. The discovery of the ruins of Angkor Wat by Westerners (the Khmers had never fully abandoned the temples of Angkor) in the jungle by the French explorer Henri Mouhot in 1861 had given Cambodia a romantic reputation in France, as the home of the vast, mysterious ruins of the Khmer empire. Upon reaching Cambodia, Malraux, Clara and friend Louis Chevasson undertook an expedition into unexplored areas of the former imperial settlements in search of hidden temples, hoping to find artifacts and items that could be sold to art collectors and museums. At about the same time archaeologists, with the approval of the French government, were removing large numbers of items from Angkor - many of which are now housed in the Guimet Museum in Paris. On his return, Malraux was arrested and charged by French colonial authorities for removing a \"bas-relief\" from the exquisite \"Banteay Srei\" temple. Although he was guilty, his arrest and imprisonment were deemed inappropriate \u2013 for the crime was of no consequence. Clara, his wife, started a campaign for his acquittal and a number of notable arts and literary figures signed a petition defending Malraux: among them were Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac, Andr\u00e9 Breton and Andr\u00e9 Gide. Malraux had his sentence reduced to a year, and then suspended.\nMalraux's experiences in Indochina led him to become highly critical of the French colonial authorities there. In 1925, with Paul Monin, a progressive lawyer, he helped to organize the Young Annam League and founded a newspaper \"L'Indochine\" to champion Vietnamese independence. After falling foul of the French authorities, Malraux claimed to have crossed over to China where he was involved with the Kuomintang and their then allies, the Chinese Communists, in their struggle against the warlords in the Great Northern Expedition before they turned on each other in 1927, which marked the beginning of the Chinese Civil War that was to last on and off until 1949. In fact, Malraux did not first visit China until 1931 and he did not see the bloody suppression of the Chinese Communists by the Kuomintang in 1927 first-hand as he often implied that he did, although he did do much reading on the subject.\nAsian novels.\nOn his return to France, Malraux published \"The Temptation of the West\" (1926). The work was in the form of an exchange of letters between a Westerner and an Asian, comparing aspects of the two cultures. This was followed by his first novel \"The Conquerors\" (1928), and then by \"The Royal Way\" (1930) which reflected some of his Cambodian experiences. The American literary critic Dennis Roak described \"Les Conqu\u00e9rants\" as influenced by \"The Seven Pillars of Wisdom\" as it was narrated in the present tense \"...with its staccato snatches of dialogue and the images of sound and sight, light and darkness, which create a compellingly haunting atmosphere.\" \"The Conquerors\" was set in the summer of 1925 against the backdrop of the general strike called by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Kuomintang in Hong Kong and Canton, the novel concerns political intrigue amongst the \"anti-imperialist\" camp. The novel is narrated by an unnamed Frenchman who travels from Saigon to Hong Kong to Canton to meet an old friend named Garine who is a professional revolutionary working with Mikhail Borodin, who in real life was the Comintern's principal agent in China. The novel alternates between depictions of Chinese nationalist militancy and British imperial anxieties. The Kuomintang are depicted rather unflatteringly as conservative Chinese nationalists uninterested in social reform, another faction is led by Hong, a Chinese assassin committed to revolutionary violence for the sake of violence, and only the Communists are portrayed relatively favorably. Much of the dramatic tension between the novel concerns a three-way struggle between the hero, Garine and Borodin who is only interested in using the revolution in China to achieve Soviet foreign policy goals. The fact that the European characters are considerably better drawn than the Asian characters reflected Malraux's understanding of China at the time as more of an exotic place where Europeans played out their own dramas rather than a place to be understood in its own right. Initially, Malraux's writings on Asia reflected the influence of Orientalism presenting the Far East as strange, exotic, decadent, mysterious, sensuous and violent, but Malraux's picture of China grew somewhat more humanized and understanding as Malraux disregarded his Orientalist and Eurocentric viewpoint in favor of one that presented the Chinese as fellow human beings.\nThe second of Malraux's Asian novels was the semi-autobiographical \"La Voie Royale\" which relates the adventures of a Frenchman Claude Vannec who together with his Danish friend Perken head down the royal road of the title into the jungle of Cambodia with the intention of stealing bas-relief sculptures from the ruins of Hindu temples. After many perilous adventures, Vannec and Perken are captured by hostile tribesmen and find an old friend of Perken's, Grabot, who had already been captured for some time. Grabot, a deserter from the French Foreign Legion had been reduced to nothing as his captors blinded him and left him tied to a stake starving, a stark picture of human degradation. The three Europeans escape, but Perken is wounded and dies of an infection. Through ostensibly an adventure novel, \"La Voie Royale\" is in fact a philosophical novel concerned with existential questions about the meaning of life. The book was a failure at the time as the publishers marketed it as a stirring adventure story set in far-off, exotic, Cambodia which confused many readers who, instead, found a novel pondering deep philosophical questions.\nIn his Asian novels Malraux used Asia as a stick to beat Europe with as he argued that after World War I the ideal of progress of a Europe getting better and better for the general advancement of humanity was dead. As such, Malraux now argued that European civilization was faced with a \"Nietzschean\" void, a twilight world, without God or progress, in which the old values had proven worthless and a sense of spirituality that had once existed was gone. An agnostic, but an intensely spiritual man, Malraux maintained that what was needed was an \"aesthetic spirituality\" in which love of 'Art' and 'Civilization' would allow one to appreciate \"le sacr\u00e9\" in life, a sensibility that was both tragic and awe-inspiring as one surveyed all of the cultural treasures of the world, a mystical sense of humanity's place in a universe that was as astonishingly beautiful as it was mysterious. Malraux argued that as death is inevitable and in a world devoid of meaning, which thus was \"absurd\", only art could offer meaning in an \"absurd\" world. Malraux argued that art transcended time as art allowed one to connect with the past, and the very act of appreciating art was itself an act of art as the love of art was part of a continuation of endless artistic metamorphosis that constantly created something new. Malraux argued that as different types of art went in and out of style, the revival of a style was a metamorphosis as art could never be appreciated in exactly the same way as it was in the past. As art was timeless, it conquered time and death as artworks lived on after the death of the artist. The American literary critic Jean-Pierre H\u00e9rubel wrote that Malraux never entirely worked out a coherent philosophy as his mystical \"Weltanschauung\" (world view) was based more upon emotion than logic. In Malraux's viewpoint, of all the professions, the artist was the most important as artists were the explorers and voyagers of the human spirit, as artistic creation was the highest form of human achievement for only art could illustrate humanity's relationship with the universe. As Malraux wrote, \"there is something far greater than history and it is the persistence of genius\". H\u00e9rubel argued that it is fruitless to attempt to criticize Malraux for his lack of methodological consistency as Malraux cultivated a poetical sensibility, a certain lyrical style, that appealed more to the heart than to the brain. Malraux was a proud Frenchman, but he also saw himself as a citizen of the world, a man who loved the cultural achievements of all of the civilizations across the globe. At the same time, Malraux criticized those intellectuals who wanted to retreat into the ivory tower, instead arguing that it was the duty of intellectuals to participate and fight (both metaphorically and literally) in the great political causes of the day, that the only truly great causes were the ones that one was willing to die for.\nIn 1933 Malraux published \"Man's Fate\" (\"La Condition Humaine\"), a novel about the 1927 failed Communist rebellion in Shanghai. Despite Malraux's attempts to present his Chinese characters as more three dimensional and developed than he did in \"Les Conqu\u00e9rants\", his biographer Oliver Todd wrote he could not \"quite break clear of a conventional idea of China with coolies, bamboo shoots, opium smokers, destitutes, and prostitutes\", which were the standard French stereotypes of China at the time. The work was awarded the 1933 Prix Goncourt. After the breakdown of his marriage with Clara, Malraux lived with journalist and novelist Josette Clotis, starting in 1933. Malraux and Josette had two sons: Pierre-Gauthier (1940\u20131961) and Vincent (1943\u20131961). During 1944, while Malraux was fighting in Alsace, Josette died, aged 34, when she slipped while boarding a train. His two sons died together in 1961 in an automobile accident. The car they were driving had been given them by Vincent's girlfriend, the wealthy Clara Saint.\nSearching for lost cities.\nOn 22 February 1934, Malraux together with \u00c9douard Corniglion-Molinier embarked on a much publicized expedition to find the lost capital of the Queen of Sheba mentioned in the Old Testament. Saudi Arabia and Yemen were both remote, dangerous places that few Westerners visited at the time, and what made the expedition especially dangerous was while Malraux was searching for the lost cities of Sheba, King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia invaded Yemen, and the ensuing Saudi\u2013Yemeni war greatly complicated Malraux's search. After several weeks of flying over the deserts in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, Malraux returned to France to announce that the ruins he found up in the mountains of Yemen were the capital of the Queen of Sheba. Though Malraux's claim is not generally accepted by archeologists, the expedition bolstered Malraux's fame and provided the material for several of his later essays.\nSpanish Civil War.\nDuring the 1930s, Malraux was active in the anti-fascist Popular Front in France. At the beginning of the Spanish Civil War he joined the Republican forces in Spain, serving in and helping to organize the small Spanish Republican Air Force. Curtis Cate, one of his biographers, writes that Malraux was slightly wounded twice during efforts to stop the Battle of Madrid in 1936 as the Spanish Nationalists attempted to take Madrid, but the historian Hugh Thomas argues otherwise.\nThe French government sent aircraft to Republican forces in Spain, but they were obsolete by the standards of 1936. They were mainly Potez 540 bombers and Dewoitine D.372 fighters. The slow Potez 540 rarely survived three months of air missions, flying at 160 knots against enemy fighters flying at more than 250 knots. Few of the fighters proved to be airworthy, and they were delivered intentionally without guns or gunsights. The Ministry of Defense of France had feared that modern types of planes would easily be captured by the German Condor Legion fighting with General Francisco Franco, and the lesser models were a way of maintaining official \"neutrality\". The planes were surpassed by more modern types introduced by the end of 1936 on both sides.\nThe Republic circulated photos of Malraux standing next to some Potez 540 bombers suggesting that France was on their side, at a time when France and the United Kingdom had officially declared neutrality. But Malraux's commitment to the Republicans was personal, like that of many other foreign volunteers, and there was never any suggestion that he was there at the behest of the French Government. Malraux himself was not a pilot, and never claimed to be one, but his leadership qualities seem to have been recognized because he was made Squadron Leader of the 'Espa\u00f1a' squadron. Acutely aware of the Republicans' inferior armaments, of which outdated aircraft were just one example, he toured the United States to raise funds for the cause. In 1937 he published \"L'Espoir\" (Man's Hope), a novel influenced by his Spanish war experiences. In July 1937 he attended the Second International Writers' Congress, the purpose of which was to discuss the attitude of intellectuals to the war, held in Valencia, Barcelona and Madrid and attended by many writers including Ernest Hemingway, Stephen Spender and Pablo Neruda.\nMalraux's participation in major historical events such as the Spanish Civil War inevitably brought him determined adversaries as well as strong supporters, and the resulting polarization of opinion has colored, and rendered questionable, much that has been written about his life. Fellow combatants praised Malraux's leadership and sense of camaraderie While Andr\u00e9 Marty of the Comintern called him as an \"adventurer\" for his high profile and demands on the Spanish Republican government. The British historian Antony Beevor also claims that \"Malraux stands out, not just because he was a mythomaniac in his claims of martial heroism \u2013 in Spain and later in the French Resistance \u2013 but because he cynically exploited the opportunity for intellectual heroism in the legend of the Spanish Republic.\"\nIn any case, Malraux's participation in events such as the Spanish Civil War has tended to distract attention from his important literary achievement. Malraux saw himself first and foremost as a writer and thinker (and not a \"man of action\" as biographers so often portray him) but his extremely eventful life \u2013 a far cry from the stereotype of the French intellectual confined to his study or a Left Bank caf\u00e9 \u2013 has tended to obscure this fact. As a result, his literary works, including his important works on the theory of art, have received less attention than one might expect, especially in Anglophone countries.\nWorld War II.\nAt the beginning of the Second World War, Malraux joined the French Army. He was captured in 1940 during the Battle of France but escaped and later joined the French Resistance. In 1944, he was captured by the Gestapo. Detained in the Saint-Michel prison, he narrowly escaped deportation thanks to the liberation of Toulouse by Allied forces on August 19, 1944. He later commanded the Brigade Alsace-Lorraine in defence of Strasbourg and in the attack on Stuttgart.\nOtto Abetz was the German Ambassador, and produced a series of \"black lists\" of authors forbidden to be read, circulated or sold in Nazi occupied France. These included anything written by a Jew, a communist, an Anglo-Saxon or anyone else who was anti-Germanic or anti-fascist. Louis Aragon and Andr\u00e9 Malraux were both on these \"Otto Lists\" of forbidden authors.\nAfter the war, Malraux was awarded the \"M\u00e9daille de la R\u00e9sistance\" and the . The British awarded him the Distinguished Service Order, for his work with British liaison officers in Corr\u00e8ze, Dordogne and Lot. After Dordogne was liberated, Malraux led a battalion of former resistance fighters to Alsace-Lorraine, where they fought alongside the First Army.\nDuring the war, he worked on his last novel, \"The Struggle with the Angel\", the title drawn from the story of the Biblical Jacob. The manuscript was destroyed by the Gestapo after his capture in 1944. A surviving first section, titled \"The Walnut Trees of Altenburg\", was published after the war.\nAfter the war.\nShortly after the war, General Charles de Gaulle appointed Malraux as his Minister for Information (1945\u20131946). Soon after, he completed his first book on art, \"The Psychology of Art\", published in three volumes (1947\u20131949). The work was subsequently revised and republished in one volume as \"The Voices of Silence\" (\"Les Voix du Silence\"), the first part of which has been published separately as \"The Museum without Walls\". Other important works on the theory of art were to follow. These included the three-volume \"Metamorphosis of the Gods\" and \"Precarious Man and Literature\", the latter published posthumously in 1977. In 1948, Malraux married a second time, to Marie-Madeleine Lioux, a concert pianist and the widow of his half-brother, Roland Malraux. They separated in 1966. Subsequently, Malraux lived with Louise de Vilmorin in the Vilmorin family ch\u00e2teau at Verri\u00e8res-le-Buisson, Essonne, a suburb southwest of Paris. Vilmorin was best known as a writer of delicate but mordant tales, often set in aristocratic or artistic milieu. Her most famous novel was \"Madame de...\", published in 1951, which was adapted into the celebrated film \"The Earrings of Madame de...\" (1953), directed by Max Oph\u00fcls and starring Charles Boyer, Danielle Darrieux and Vittorio de Sica. Vilmorin's other works included \"Juliette\", \"La lettre dans un taxi\", \"Les belles amours\", \"Saintes-Unefois\", and \"Intimit\u00e9s\". Her letters to Jean Cocteau were published after the death of both correspondents. After Louise's death, Malraux spent his final years with her relative, Sophie de Vilmorin.\nIn 1957, Malraux published the first volume of his trilogy on art entitled \"The Metamorphosis of the Gods\". The second two volumes (not yet translated into English) were published shortly before he died in 1976. They are entitled \"L'Irr\u00e9el\" and \"L'Intemporel\" and discuss artistic developments from the Renaissance to modern times. Malraux also initiated the series \"Arts of Mankind\", an ambitious survey of world art that generated more than thirty large, illustrated volumes.\nWhen de Gaulle returned to the French presidency in 1958, Malraux became France's first Minister of Cultural Affairs, a post he held from 1958 to 1969. On 7 February 1962, Malraux was the target of an assassination attempt by the \"Organisation arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te\" (OAS), which set off a bomb to his apartment building that failed to kill its intended target, but did leave a four-year-old girl who was living in the adjoining apartment blinded by the shrapnel. Ironically, Malraux was a lukewarm supporter of de Gaulle's decision to grant independence to Algeria, but the OAS was not aware of this, and had decided to assassinate Malraux as a high-profile minister.\nOn 23 May 1961, Andr\u00e9 Malraux's two sons, Gauthier and Vincent, were killed in a car accident.\nAmong many initiatives, Malraux launched an innovative (and subsequently widely imitated) program to clean the blackened fa\u00e7ades of notable French buildings, revealing the natural stone underneath. He also created a number of \"maisons de la culture\" in provincial cities and worked to preserve France's national heritage by promoting industrial archaeology. An intellectual who took the arts very seriously, Malraux saw his mission as Culture Minister to preserve France's heritage and to improve the cultural levels of the masses. Malraux's efforts to promote French culture mostly concerned renewing old or building new libraries, art galleries, museums, theatres, opera houses, and \"maisons de la culture\" (centres built in provincial cities that were a mixture of a library, art gallery and theatre). In 1964 he created the Inventaire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du patrimoine culturel to record all goods based on archival sources created by human kind throughout France. Film, television and music took less of Malraux's time, and the changing demographics caused by immigration from the Third World stymied his efforts to promote French high culture, as many immigrants from Muslim and African nations did not find French high culture that compelling. A passionate bibliophile, Malraux built up a huge collection of books both as a cultural minister for the nation and as a man for himself.\nMalraux was an outspoken supporter of the Bangladesh liberation movement during the 1971 Liberation War of Bangladesh and despite his age seriously considered joining the struggle. When Indira Gandhi came to Paris in November 1971, there was extensive discussion between them about the situation in Bangladesh.\nDuring this post-war period, Malraux published a series of semi-autobiographical works, the first entitled \"Antim\u00e9moires\" (1967). A later volume in the series, \"Lazarus\", is a reflection on death occasioned by his experiences during a serious illness. \"La T\u00eate d'obsidienne\" (1974) (translated as \"Picasso's Mask\") concerns Picasso, and visual art more generally. In his last book, published posthumously in 1977, \"L'Homme pr\u00e9caire et la litt\u00e9rature\", Malraux propounded the theory that there was a \"biblioth\u00e8que imaginaire\" where writers created works that influenced subsequent writers much as painters learned their craft by studying the old masters; once they have understood the work of the old masters, writers would sally forth with the knowledge gained to create new works that added to the growing and never-ending \"biblioth\u00e8que imaginaire\". (See also mus\u00e9e imaginaire). An elitist who appreciated what he saw as the high culture of all the nations of the world, Malraux was especially interested in art history and archaeology, and saw his duty as a writer to share what he knew with ordinary people. An aesthete, Malraux believed that art was spiritually enriching and necessary for humanity.\nMalraux was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature 94 times. He was an annual contender for the prize in the 1950s and 1960s, but was never awarded. In 1969 he was the main candidate considered for the prize along with Samuel Beckett. His candidacy was supported by some members of the Nobel committee, but was rejected for political reasons by another member, and the Swedish Academy ultimately decided that Beckett should be awarded.\nDeath.\nMalraux died in Cr\u00e9teil, near Paris, on 23 November 1976 from a lung embolism. He was a heavy smoker and had cancer. He was cremated and his ashes buried in the Verri\u00e8res-le-Buisson (Essonne) cemetery. In recognition of his contributions to French culture, his ashes were moved to the Panth\u00e9on in Paris during 1996, on the twentieth anniversary of his death.\nLegacy and honours.\nThere is a large body of critical commentary on Malraux's literary \"\u0153uvre\", including his extensive writings on art. However, some of his works, including the last two volumes of \"The Metamorphosis of the Gods\" (\"L'Irr\u00e9el\" and \"L'Intemporel\"), are not yet available in English translation. Malraux's works on the theory of art contain a revolutionary approach to art that challenges the Enlightenment tradition that treats art simply as a source of \"aesthetic pleasure\". However, as French writer Andr\u00e9 Brincourt has commented, Malraux's books on art have been \"skimmed a lot but very little read\" (this is especially true in Anglophone countries) and the radical implications of his thinking are often missed. A particularly important aspect of Malraux's thinking about art is his explanation of the capacity of art to transcend time. In contrast to the traditional notion that art endures because it is timeless (\"eternal\"), Malraux argues that art lives on through metamorphosis \u2013 a process of resuscitation (where the work had fallen into obscurity) and transformation in meaning.

On the other hand, 6 is not a lower bound for S since it is not smaller than every element in S. 13934 and other numbers \"x\" such that x \u2265 13934 would be an upper bound for \"S\".\nThe set \"S\" = {42} has 42 as both an upper bound and a lower bound; all other numbers are either an upper bound or a lower bound for that S.\nEvery subset of the natural numbers has a lower bound since the natural numbers have a least element (0 or 1, depending on convention). An infinite subset of the natural numbers cannot be bounded from above. An infinite subset of the integers may be bounded from below or bounded from above, but not both. An infinite subset of the rational numbers may or may not be bounded from below, and may or may not be bounded from above.\nEvery finite subset of a non-empty totally ordered set has both upper and lower bounds.\nBounds of functions.\nThe definitions can be generalized to functions and even to sets of functions.\nGiven a function with domain D and a preordered set (\"K\", \u2264) as codomain, an element \"y\" of K is an upper bound of if \"y\" \u2265 \"f\"(\"x\") for each x in D. The upper bound is called \"sharp\" if equality holds for at least one value of x. It indicates that the constraint is optimal, and thus cannot be further reduced without invalidating the inequality.\nSimilarly, a function g defined on domain D and having the same codomain (\"K\", \u2264) is an upper bound of , if \"g\"(\"x\") \u2265 \"f\"(\"x\") for each x in D. The function g is further said to be an upper bound of a set of functions, if it is an upper bound of \"each\" function in that set.\nThe notion of lower bound for (sets of) functions is defined analogously, by replacing \u2265 with \u2264.\nTight bounds.\nAn upper bound is said to be a \"tight upper bound\", a \"least upper bound\", or a \"supremum\", if no smaller value is an upper bound. Similarly, a lower bound is said to be a \"tight lower bound\", a \"greatest lower bound\", or an \"infimum\", if no greater value is a lower bound.\nExact upper bounds.\nAn upper bound u of a subset S of a preordered set (\"K\", \u2264) is said to be an \"exact upper bound\" for S if every element of K that is strictly majorized by u is also majorized by some element of S. Exact upper bounds of reduced products of linear orders play an important role in PCF theory.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Meteor's development was heavily reliant on its ground-breaking turbojet engines, pioneered by Frank Whittle and his company, Power Jets Ltd. Development of the aircraft began in 1940, although work on the engines had been under way since 1936.\nThe Meteor first flew in 1943 and commenced operations on 27 July 1944 with No. 616 Squadron RAF. The Meteor was not a sophisticated aircraft in its aerodynamics, but proved to be a successful combat fighter. Gloster's 1946 civil Meteor F.4 demonstrator \"G-AIDC\" was the first civilian-registered jet aircraft in the world. Several major variants of the Meteor incorporated technological advances during the 1940s and 1950s. Thousands of Meteors were built to fly with the RAF and other air forces and remained in use for several decades.\nSlower and less heavily armed than its German counterpart, the jet-powered Messerschmitt Me\u00a0262, the Meteor saw limited action in the Second World War. Meteors of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) fought in the Korean War. Several other operators such as Argentina, Egypt and Israel flew Meteors in later regional conflicts. Specialised variants of the Meteor were developed for use in photographic aerial reconnaissance and as night fighters.\nThe Meteor was also used in research and development and to break several aviation records. On 20 September 1945, a heavily modified Meteor I, powered by two Rolls-Royce RB.50 Trent turbine engines driving propellers, became the first turboprop aircraft to fly. On 7 November 1945, a Meteor F.3 set the first official airspeed record by a jet aircraft at . In 1946, a Meteor F.4 reached a record speed of . Meteors also broke records in flight time endurance and rate of climb.\nOn 10 February 1954, a specially adapted Meteor F.8, the \"Meteor Prone Pilot\", which placed the pilot into a prone position to counteract inertial forces, took its first flight.\nIn the 1950s, the Meteor became increasingly obsolete as more nations developed jet fighters, many of which used a swept wing instead of the Meteor's conventional straight wing. The RAF service replaced its Meteors with newer types such as the Hawker Hunter and Gloster Javelin.\nAs of 2023[ [update]], two Meteors, \"G-JSMA\" and \"G-JWMA\", remained in active service with the Martin-Baker company as ejection seat testbeds. One further aircraft in the USA remained airworthy, as did another in Australia.\nDevelopment.\nOrigins.\nThe development of the turbojet-powered Gloster Meteor was a collaboration between the Gloster Aircraft Company and Frank Whittle's firm, Power Jets Ltd. Whittle formed Power Jets Ltd in March 1936 to develop his ideas of jet propulsion, Whittle himself serving as the company's chief engineer. For several years, attracting financial backers and aviation firms prepared to take on Whittle's radical ideas was difficult. In 1931, Armstrong-Siddeley had evaluated and rejected Whittle's proposal, finding it to be technically sound but at the limits of engineering capability. Securing funding was a persistently worrying issue throughout the early development of the engine. The first Whittle prototype jet engine, the Power Jets WU, began running trials in early 1937; shortly afterwards, both Sir Henry Tizard, chairman of the Aeronautical Research Committee, and the Air Ministry gave the project their support.\nOn 28 April 1939, Whittle made a visit to the premises of the Gloster Aircraft Company, where he met several key figures, such as George Carter, Gloster's chief designer. Carter took a keen interest in Whittle's project, particularly when he saw the operational Power Jets W.1 engine, and quickly used it as the basis for several rough proposals of various aircraft designs. Independently, Whittle had also been producing proposals for a high-altitude jet-powered bomber, although following the start of the Second World War and the Battle for France, a greater national emphasis arose on fighter aircraft. Power Jets and Gloster quickly formed a mutual understanding around mid-1939.\nIn spite of ongoing infighting between Power Jets and several of its stakeholders, the Air Ministry contracted Gloster in late 1939 to manufacture a prototype aircraft powered by one of Whittle's new turbojet engines. The single-engined proof-of-concept Gloster E28/39, the first British jet-powered aircraft, conducted its maiden flight on 15 May 1941, flown by Gloster's chief test pilot, Flight Lieutenant Philip \"Gerry\" Sayer. The success of the E.28/39 proved the viability of jet propulsion, and Gloster pressed ahead with designs for a production fighter aircraft. Due to the limited thrust available from early jet engines, it was decided that subsequent production aircraft would be powered by a pair of turbojet engines.\nIn 1940, for a \"military load\" of , the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) had advised that work on an aircraft of all-up weight, with a total static thrust of should be started, with an design for the expected, more powerful, W.2 and axial engine designs. George Carter's calculations based on the RAE work and his own investigations were that a aircraft with two or four 20\u00a0mm cannons and six 0.303 machine guns would have a top speed of at sea level and at . In January 1941 Gloster were told by Lord Beaverbrook that the twin jet fighter was of \"unique importance\", and that the company was to stop work on a night-fighter development of their F.9/37 to Specification F.18/40.\nPrototypes.\nIn August 1940, Carter presented Gloster's initial proposals for a twin-engined jet fighter with a tricycle undercarriage. On 7 February 1941, Gloster received an order for twelve prototypes (later reduced to eight) under Specification F9/40. A letter of intent for the production of 300 of the new fighter, initially to be named \"Thunderbolt,\" was issued on 21 June 1941; to avoid confusion with the USAAF Republic P-47 Thunderbolt which had been issued with the same name to the RAF in 1944, the aircraft's name was subsequently changed to \"Meteor.\" During the aircraft's secretive development, employees and officials made use of the codename \"Rampage\" to refer to the Meteor, as similarly the de Havilland Vampire would initially be referred to as the \"Spider Crab\". Test locations and other key project information were also kept secret.\nAlthough taxiing trials were carried out in 1942, it was not until the following year that any flights took place due to production and approval holdups with the Power Jets W.2 engine powering the Meteor. On 26 November 1942 production of the Meteor was ordered to stop due to the delays at subcontractor Rover, which was struggling to manufacture the W.2 engines on schedule; considerable interest was shown in Gloster's E.1/44 proposal for a single-engine fighter, unofficially named Ace. Gloster continued development work on the Meteor and the production-stop order was overturned in favour of the construction of six (later increased to eight) F9/40 prototypes alongside three E.1/44 prototypes. Due to the breakdown in the relationship between Rover and Powerjets and the availability of Rolls Royce's supercharger division, responsibilities for development and production of the W.2B engine were transferred to Rolls-Royce that year.\nOn 5 March 1943, the fifth prototype, serial \"DG206\", powered by two substituted de Havilland Halford H.1 engines owing to problems with the intended W.2 engines, became the first Meteor to become airborne at RAF Cranwell, piloted by Michael Daunt. On the initial flight, an uncontrollable yawing motion was discovered, which led to a redesigned larger rudder; however, no difficulties had been attributed to the groundbreaking turbojet propulsion. Only two prototypes flew with de Havilland engines because of their low flight endurance. Before the first prototype aircraft had even undertaken its first flight, an extended order for 100 production-standard aircraft had been placed by the RAF.\nThe first Whittle-engined aircraft, \"DG205/G\", flew on 12 June 1943 (later crashing during takeoff on 27 April 1944) and was followed by \"DG202/G\" on 24 July. \"DG202/G\" was later used for deck handling tests aboard aircraft carrier . \"DG203/G\" made its first flight on 9 November 1943, later becoming a ground instructional airframe. \"DG204/G\", powered by Metrovick F.2 engines, first flew on 13 November 1943; \"DG204/G\" was lost in an accident on 4 January 1944, the cause believed to have been an engine compressor failure due to overspeed. \"DG208/G\" made its d\u00e9but on 20 January 1944, by which time the majority of design problems had been overcome and a production design had been approved. \"DG209/G\" was used as an engine testbed by Rolls-Royce, first flying on 18 April 1944. \"DG207/G\" was intended to be the basis for the Meteor F.2 with de Havilland engines, but it did not fly until 24 July 1945, at which time the Meteor 3 was in full production and de Havilland's attention was being redirected to the upcoming de Havilland Vampire; consequently the F.2 was cancelled.\nInto production.\nOn 12 January 1944, the first Meteor F.1, serial \"EE210/G\", took to the air from Moreton Valence in Gloucestershire. It was essentially identical to the F9/40 prototypes except for the addition of four nose-mounted 20\u00a0mm (.79\u00a0in) Hispano Mk V cannon and some changes to the canopy to improve all-round visibility. Due to the F.1's similarity to the prototypes, they were frequently operated in the test program to progress British understanding of jet propulsion, and it took until July 1944 for the aircraft to enter squadron service. \"EE210/G\" was later sent to the U.S. for evaluation in exchange for a pre-production Bell YP-59A Airacomet, the Meteor being flown first by John Grierson at Muroc Army Airfield on 15 April 1944.\nOriginally 300 F.1s were ordered, but the total produced was reduced to 20 aircraft as the follow-on orders had been converted to the more advanced models. Some of the last major refinements to the Meteor's early design were trialled using this first production batch, and what was to become the long-term design of the engine nacelles was introduced upon \"EE211\". The original nacelles had been discovered by the RAE to suffer from compressibility buffeting at higher speeds, causing increased drag; the re-designed longer nacelles eliminated this and provided an increase in the Meteor's maximum speed. The lengthened nacelles were introduced on the final fifteen Meteor IIIs. \"EE215\" was the first Meteor to be fitted with guns; \"EE215\" was also used in engine reheat trials, the addition of reheat increasing top speed from 420\u00a0mph to 460\u00a0mph. It was later converted into the first two-seat Meteor. Due to the radical differences between jet-powered aircraft and those that it replaced, a special \"Tactical Flight\" or \"T-Flight\" unit was established to prepare the Meteor for squadron service, led by Group Captain Hugh Joseph Wilson. The Tactical Flight was formed at Farnborough in May 1944, the first Meteors arriving the following month, upon which both tactical applications and limitations were extensively explored.\nOn 17 July 1944, the Meteor F.1 was cleared for service use. Shortly afterwards, elements of the Tactical Flight and their aircraft were transferred to operational RAF squadrons. The first deliveries to No. 616 Squadron RAF, the first operational squadron to receive the Meteor, began in July 1944. When the F.2 was cancelled, the Meteor F.3 became the immediate successor to the F.1 and alleviated some of the shortcomings of the F.1. In August 1944, the first F.3 prototype flew; early F.3 production aircraft were still fitted with the Welland engine as the Derwent engine's production was just starting at this point. A total of 210 F.3 aircraft were produced before they were in turn superseded by production of the Meteor F.4 in 1945.\nSeveral Meteor F.3s were converted into navalised aircraft. The adaptations included a strengthened undercarriage and arrester hook. Operational trials of the type took place aboard . The trials included carrier landings and takeoffs. Performance of these naval prototype Meteors proved to be favourable, including takeoff performance, leading to further trials with a modified Meteor F.4 fitted with folding wings; a \"clipped wing\" was also adopted. The Meteor later entered service with the Royal Navy, but only as a land-based trainer, the Meteor T.7, to prepare pilots of the Fleet Air Arm for flying other jet aircraft such as the de Havilland Sea Vampire.\nWhile various marks of Meteor had been introduced by 1948, they had remained very similar to the prototypes of the Meteor; consequently, the performance of the Meteor F.4 was beginning to be eclipsed by new jet designs. Gloster therefore embarked on a redesign programme to produce a new version of the Meteor with better performance. Designated \"Meteor F.8\", this upgraded variant was a potent fighter aircraft, forming the bulk of RAF Fighter Command between 1950 and 1955. The Meteor continued to be operated in a military capacity by several nations into the 1960s.\nNight fighter.\nTo replace the increasingly obsolete de Havilland Mosquito as a night fighter, the Meteor was adapted to serve in the role as an interim aircraft. Gloster had initially proposed a night fighter design to meet the Air Ministry specification for the Mosquito replacement, based on the two seater trainer variant of the Meteor, with the pilot in the front seat and the navigator in the rear. Once accepted however, work on the project was swiftly transferred to Armstrong Whitworth to perform both the detailed design process and production of the type; the first prototype flew on 31 May 1950. Although based on the T.7 twin seater, it used the fuselage and tail of the F.8, and the longer wings of the F.3. An extended nose contained the AI Mk 10 (the 1940s Westinghouse SCR-720) Air Intercept radar. As a consequence the 20\u00a0mm cannons were moved into the wings, outboard of the engines. A ventral fuel tank and wing mounted drop tanks completed the Armstrong Whitworth Meteor NF.11.\nAs radar technology developed, a new Meteor night fighter was developed to use the improved US-built APS-21 system. The \"NF.12\" first flew on 21 April 1953. It was similar to the NF.11 but had a nose section longer; the fin was enlarged to compensate for the greater keel area of the enlarged nose and to counter the airframe reaction to the sideways oscillating motion of the radar scanner which caused difficulty aiming the guns, an anti-tramp motor operating on the rudder was fitted midway up the front leading edge of the fin. The NF.12 also had the new Rolls-Royce Derwent 9 engines and the wings were reinforced to handle the new engine. Deliveries of the NF.12 started in 1953, with the type entering squadron service in early 1954, equipping seven squadrons (Nos 85, 25, 152, 46, 72, 153 and 64); the aircraft was replaced over 1958\u20131959.\nThe final Meteor night fighter was the \"NF.14\". First flown on 23 October 1953, the NF.14 was based on the NF.12 but had an even longer nose, extended by a further to accommodate new equipment, increasing the total length to and a larger bubble canopy to replace the framed T.7 version. Just 100 NF.14s were built; they first entered service in February 1954 beginning with No. 25 Squadron and were being replaced as early as 1956 by the Gloster Javelin. Overseas, they remained in service a little longer, serving with No. 60 Squadron at Tengah, Singapore until 1961. As the NF.14 was replaced, some 14 were converted to training aircraft as the \"NF(T).14\" and given to No. 2 Air Navigation School on RAF Thorney Island until transferring to No. 1 Air Navigation School at RAF Stradishall where they served until 1965.\nDesign.\nOverview.\nThe first operational version of the Meteor, designated as the Meteor F.1, apart from the minor airframe refinements, was a straightforward \"militarisation\" of the earlier F9/40 prototypes. The dimensions of the standard Meteor F.1 were long with a span of , with an empty weight of and a maximum takeoff weight of . Despite the revolutionary turbojet propulsion used, the design of the Meteor was relatively orthodox and did not take advantage of many aerodynamic features used on other, later jet fighters, such as swept wings; the Meteor shared a broadly similar basic configuration to its German equivalent, the Messerschmitt Me 262, which was also aerodynamically conventional.\nIt was an all-metal aircraft with a tricycle undercarriage and conventional low, straight wings with mid-mounted turbojet engines and a high-mounted tailplane clear of the jet exhaust. The Meteor F.1 exhibited some problematic flying characteristics typical of early jet aircraft; it suffered from stability problems at high transonic speeds, large trim changes, high stick forces and self-sustained yaw instability (snaking) caused by airflow separation over the thick tail surfaces. The longer fuselage of the Meteor T.7, a two-seater trainer, significantly reduced the aerodynamic instability that the early Meteors were known for.\nLater Meteor variants would see a large variety of changes from the initial Meteor F.1 introduced to service in 1944. Much attention was given to raising the aircraft's top speed, often by improving the airframe's aerodynamic qualities, incorporating the latest engine developments, and increasing the strength of the airframe. The Meteor F.8, which emerged in the late 1940s, was considered to have substantially improved performance over prior variants; the F.8 was reportedly the most powerful single-seat aircraft flying in 1947, capable of ascending to within five minutes.\nConstruction.\nFrom the outset, each Meteor was constructed from several modular sections or separately produced units, a deliberate design choice to allow for production to be dispersed and for easy disassembly for transport. Each aircraft comprised five main sections: nose, forward fuselage, central section, rear fuselage and tail units; the wings were also built out of lengthwise sections. The forward section contained the pressure cabin, gun compartments, and forward undercarriage. The centre section incorporated much of the structural elements, including the inner wing, engine nacelles, fuel tank, ammunition drums, and main undercarriage. The rear fuselage was of a conventional semi-monocoque structure. Various aluminium alloys were the primary materials used throughout the structure of the Meteor, such as the stressed duralumin skin.\nAcross the Meteor's production life, various different companies were subcontracted to manufacture aircraft sections and major components; due to the wartime workload on producing fighter aircraft such as the Hawker Hurricane and Hawker Typhoon, neither Gloster nor the wider Hawker Siddeley Group were able to internally meet the production demand of 80 aircraft per month. Bristol Tramways produced the forward fuselage of the aircraft, the Standard Motor Company manufactured the central fuselage and inner wing sections, the Pressed Steel Company produced the rear fuselage, and Parnall Aircraft made the tail unit. Other main subcontractors included Boulton Paul Aircraft, Excelsior Motor Radiator Company, Bell Punch, Turner Manufacturing Company, and Charlesworth Bodies; as many of these firms had little or no experience producing aircraft, both quality and interchangeability of components were maintained by contractually enforced adherence to Gloster's original drawings.\nFrom the Meteor F.4 onwards, Armstrong Whitworth began completing whole units at their Coventry facility in addition to Gloster's own production line. Belgian aviation firm Avions Fairey also produced the Meteor F.8 under licence from Gloster for the Belgian Air Force; a similar licence manufacturing arrangement was made with Dutch company Fokker to meet the Royal Netherlands Air Force's order.\nEngines.\nThe \"Meteor F.1\" was powered by two Rolls-Royce Welland turbojet engines, Britain's first production jet engines, which were built under licence from Whittle's designs. The Meteor embodied the advent of practical jet propulsion; in the type's service life, both military and civil aviation manufacturers rapidly integrated turbine engines into their designs, favouring its advantages such as smoother running and greater power output. The Meteor's engines were considerably more practical than those of the German Me 262 as, unlike the Me 262, the engines were embedded into the wing in nacelles between the front and rear spars rather than underslung, saving some weight due to shorter landing gear legs and less massive spars.\nThe W.2B/23C engines upon which the Welland was based produced of thrust each, giving the aircraft a maximum speed of at and a range of . It incorporated a hydraulically driven engine starter developed by Rolls-Royce, which was automated following the press of a starter button in the cockpit. The engines also drove hydraulic and vacuum pumps as well as a generator via a Rotol gearbox fixed on the forward wing spar; the cockpit was also heated by bleed air from one of the engines. The acceleration rate of the engines was manually controlled by the pilot; rapid engine acceleration would frequently induce compressor stalls early on; the likelihood of compressor stalls was effectively eliminated upon further design refinements of both the Welland engine and the Meteor itself. At high speeds the Meteor had a tendency to lose directional stability, often during unfavourable weather conditions, leading to a \"snaking\" motion; this could be easily resolved by throttling back to reduce speed.\nBased upon designs produced by Power Jets, Rolls-Royce produced more advanced and powerful turbojet engines. Beyond numerous improvements made to the Welland engine that powered the early Meteors, Rolls-Royce brought the Rover B.26, a radical re-design from the W.2B/500 under Adrian Lombard at Rover, into service as the Derwent. The Derwent engine, and the re-designed Derwent V, a scaled down version of the Nene, was installed on many of the later production Meteors; the adoption of this new powerplant led to considerable performance increases. The Meteor often served as the basis for the development of other early turbojet designs; a pair of Meteor F.4s were sent to Rolls-Royce to aid in their experimental engine trials, \"RA435\" being used for reheat testing, and \"RA491\" being fitted with the Rolls-Royce Avon, an axial-flow engine. From their involvement in the development of the Meteor's engines, Armstrong-Siddeley, Bristol Aircraft, Metropolitan-Vickers and de Havilland also independently developed their own gas turbine engines.\nPerformance.\nDuring development, sceptical elements of the Air Ministry had expected mature piston-powered aircraft types to exceed the capabilities of the Meteor in all respects except that of speed; thus, the performance of early Meteors was considered favourable for the interceptor mission, being capable of out-diving the majority of enemy aircraft. The conclusion of in-service trials conducted between the Meteor F.3. and the Hawker Tempest V was that the performance of the Meteor exceeded the Tempest in almost all respects and that, barring some manoeuvrability issues, the Meteor could be considered a capable all-round fighter. Pilots formerly flying piston-engine aircraft often described the Meteor as being exciting to fly. British politician Norman Tebbit stated of his experience flying the Meteor in the RAF: \"Get airborne, up with the wheels, hold it low until you were about 380 knots, pull it up and she would go up, well we thought then, like a rocket\".\nEarly jet engines consumed a lot more fuel than the piston engines they replaced so the Welland engines imposed considerable flight-time limitations on the Meteor F.1, leading to the type being used for local interception duties only. In the post-war environment, there was considerable pressure to increase the range of interceptors to counter the threat of bombers armed with nuclear weapons. The long-term answer to this question was in-flight refuelling; several Meteors were provided to Flight Refuelling Limited for trials of the newly developed probe-and-drogue refuelling techniques. This capability was not incorporated in service Meteors, which had already been supplanted by more modern interceptor aircraft at this point.\nA total of 890 Meteors were lost in RAF service (145 of these crashes occurring in 1953 alone), resulting in the deaths of 450 pilots. Contributory factors in the number of crashes were the poor brakes, failure of the landing gear, the high fuel consumption and consequent short flight endurance (less than one hour) causing pilots to run out of fuel, and difficult handling with one engine out due to the widely set engines. The casualty rate was exacerbated by the lack of ejection seats in early series Meteors; the much higher speed that the aircraft was capable of meant that to bail out pilots might have to overcome high g forces and fast-moving airflow past the cockpit; there was also a greater likelihood of the pilot striking the horizontal tailplane. Ejection seats were fitted in the later F.8, FR.9, PR.10 and some experimental Meteors. The difficulty of bailing out of the Meteor had been noted by pilots during development, reporting several contributing design factors such as the limited size and relative position of the cockpit to the rest of the aircraft, and difficulty in using the two-lever jettisonable hood mechanism.\nOperational service.\nSecond World War.\nNo. 616 Squadron RAF was the first to receive operational Meteors: a total of 14 aircraft were initially delivered. The squadron was based at RAF Culmhead, Somerset and had been equipped with the Spitfire VII. The conversion to the Meteor was initially a matter of great secrecy. Following a conversion course at Farnborough attended by the squadron's six leading pilots, the first aircraft was delivered to Culmhead on 12 July 1944. The squadron and its seven Meteors moved on 21 July 1944 to RAF Manston on the east Kent coast and, within a week, 32\u00a0pilots had been converted to the type.\nThe Meteor was initially used to counter the V-1 flying bomb threat. 616 Squadron Meteors saw action for the first time on 27 July 1944, when three aircraft were active over Kent. These were the first operational jet combat missions for the Meteor and for the RAF. After some problems, especially with jamming guns, the first two V-1 \"kills\" were made on 4 August. By war's end, Meteors had accounted for 14\u00a0flying bombs. After the end of the V-1 threat, and the introduction of the ballistic V-2 rocket, the RAF was forbidden to fly the Meteor on combat missions over German-held territory for fear of an aircraft being shot down and salvaged by the Germans.\nNo. 616 Squadron briefly moved to RAF Debden to allow United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) bomber crews to gain experience and create tactics in facing jet-engined foes before moving to Colerne, Wiltshire. For a week from 10 October 1944 a series of exercises were carried out in which a flight of Meteors made mock attacks on a formation of 100 B-24s and B-17s escorted by 40 Mustangs and Thunderbolts. These suggested that, if the jet fighter attacked the formation from above, it could take advantage of its superior speed in the dive to attack the bombers and then escape by diving through the formation before the escorts could react. The best tactic to counter this was to place a fighter screen above the bombers and attempt to intercept the jets early in the dive. The exercise was also useful from No. 616 Squadron's perspective, giving valuable practical experience in Meteor operations.\nNo. 616 Squadron exchanged its F.1s for the first \"Meteor F.3\"s on 18 December 1944. These first 15 F.3s differed from the F.1 in having a sliding canopy in place of the sideways hinging canopy, increased fuel capacity and some airframe refinements. They were still powered by Welland I engines. Later F.3s were equipped with the Derwent I engines. This was a substantial improvement over the earlier mark, although the basic design still had not reached its potential. Wind tunnel and flight tests demonstrated that the original short nacelles, which did not extend far fore and aft of the wing, contributed heavily to compressibility buffeting at high speed. New, longer nacelles not only cured some of the compressibility problems but added at altitude, even without upgraded powerplants. The last batch of Meteor F.3s featured the longer nacelles; other F.3s were retrofitted in the field with the new nacelles. The F.3 also had the new Rolls-Royce Derwent engines, increased fuel capacity and a new larger, more strongly raked bubble canopy.\nJudging the \"Meteor F.3\"s were ready for combat over Europe, the RAF finally decided to deploy them on the continent. On 20 January 1945, four Meteors from 616 Squadron were moved to Melsbroek in Belgium and attached to the Second Tactical Air Force, just under three weeks after the Luftwaffe's surprise Unternehmen Bodenplatte attack on New Year's Day, in which Melsbroek's RAF base, designated as Allied Advanced Landing Ground \"B.58\", had been struck by piston-engined fighters of JG 27 and JG 54. The 616 Squadron Meteor F.3s' initial purpose was to provide air defence for the airfield, but their pilots hoped that their presence might provoke the Luftwaffe into sending Me 262 jets against them. At this point the Meteor pilots were still forbidden to fly over German-occupied territory, or to go east of Eindhoven, to prevent a downed aircraft being captured by the Germans or the Soviets.\nIn March, the entire squadron was moved to Gilze-Rijen Air Base and then in April, to Nijmegen. The Meteors flew armed reconnaissance and ground attack operations without encountering any German jet fighters. By late April, the squadron was based at Fa\u00dfberg, Germany and suffered its first losses when two aircraft collided in poor visibility. The war ended with the Meteors having destroyed 46 German aircraft through ground attack. Friendly fire through misidentification as Messerschmitt Me 262s by Allied anti-aircraft gunners was more of a threat than the already-diminished forces of the Luftwaffe; to counter this, continental-based Meteors were given an all-white finish as a recognition aid.\nPost-war.\nThe next-generation \"Meteor F.4\" prototype first flew on 17 May 1945, and went into production in 1946 when 16 RAF squadrons were already operating Meteors. Equipped with Rolls-Royce Derwent 5 engines, the smaller version of the Nene, the F.4 was faster than the F.1 at sea level (585 against 415), but the reduced wings impaired its rate of climb. The F.4 wingspan was 86.4\u00a0cm shorter than the F.3 and with blunter wing tips, derived from the world speed record prototypes. Improvements included a strengthened airframe, fully pressurised cockpit, lighter ailerons to improve manoeuvrability, and rudder trim adjustments to reduce snaking. The F.4 could be fitted with a drop tank under each wing, and experiments were carried out with carriage of underwing stores and also in lengthened fuselage models.\nBecause of increased demand, F.4 production was divided between Gloster and Armstrong Whitworth. The majority of early F.4s did not go to the RAF: 100 were exported to Argentina, seeing action on both sides in the 1955 revolution; in 1947, only RAF Nos. 74 and 222 squadrons were fully equipped with the F.4. Nine further RAF squadrons converted from 1948 onwards. From 1948, 38 F.4s were exported to the Dutch, equipping four squadrons (322, 323, 326 and 327) split between bases in Soesterberg and Leeuwarden until the mid-1950s. In 1949, only two RAF squadrons were converted to the F.4, Belgium was sold 48 aircraft in the same year (going to 349 and 350 squadrons at Beauvechain) and Denmark received 20 over 1949\u20131950. In 1950, three more RAF squadrons were upgraded, including No. 616 and, in 1951, six more.\nA modified two-seater F.4 for jet-conversion and advanced training was tested in 1949 as the \"T.7\". It was accepted by the RAF and the Fleet Air Arm and became a common addition to the various export packages (for example 43 to Belgium between 1948 and 1957, a similar number to the Netherlands over the same period, two to Syria in 1952, six to Israel in 1953, etc.). Despite its limitations\u00a0\u2013 unpressurised cockpit, no armament, limited instructor instrumentation\u00a0\u2013 more than 650 T.7s were manufactured. The T.7 remained in RAF service into the 1970s.\nAs improved jet fighters emerged, Gloster decided to modernise the F.4 while retaining as much of the manufacturing tooling as possible. The result was the definitive production model, the \"Meteor F.8\" (G-41-K), serving as a major RAF fighter until the introduction of the Hawker Hunter and the Supermarine Swift. The first prototype F.8 was a modified F.4, followed by a true prototype, \"VT150\", that flew on 12 October 1948 at Moreton Valence. Flight testing of the F.8 prototype led to the discovery of an aerodynamic problem: after ammunition was expended, the aircraft became tail-heavy and unstable around the pitch axis due to the weight of fuel in fuselage tanks no longer being balanced by the ammunition. Gloster solved the problem by substituting the tail of the abortive G 42 single-engined jet fighter. The F.8 and other production variants successfully used the new tail design, giving the later Meteors a distinctive appearance, with taller straighter edges compared with the rounded tail of the F.4s and earlier marks.\nThe F.8 also featured a fuselage stretch of , intended to shift the aircraft's centre of gravity and also eliminate the use of ballast formerly necessary in earlier marks due to the subsequent elimination from the design of two of the originally designed six installed cannon. The F.8 incorporated uprated engines, Derwent 8s, with thrust each combined with structural strengthening, a Martin Baker ejection seat and a \"blown\" teardrop cockpit canopy that provided improved pilot visibility.\nBetween 1950 and 1955, the Meteor F.8 was the mainstay of RAF Fighter Command, and served with distinction in combat in Korea with the RAAF as well as operating with many air forces worldwide, although it was clear that the original design was obsolete compared with contemporary swept-wing fighters such as the North American F-86 Sabre and the Soviet MiG-15. The last Meteor F.8 left RAF frontline squadrons in 1957. Several F.8 were used for target towing or as aggressor until 1970.\nInitial deliveries of the F.8 to the RAF were in August 1949, with the first squadron receiving its fighters in late 1950. Like the F.4, there were strong export sales of the F.8. Belgium ordered 240 aircraft, the majority assembled in The Netherlands by Fokker. The Netherlands had 160 F.8s, equipping seven squadrons until 1955. Denmark had 20, ordered in 1951, the last F.8s in front-line service in Europe. The RAAF ordered 94 F.8s, which served in the Korean War. Despite arms embargoes, both Syria and Egypt received F.8s from 1952, as did Israel, each using their Meteors during the Suez Crisis. Brazil ordered 60 new Meteor F.8s and 10 T.7 trainers in October 1952, paying with 15,000\u00a0tons of raw cotton.\nIn the 1950s, Meteors were developed into effective photo-reconnaissance, training and night fighter versions. The fighter reconnaissance (FR) versions were the first to be built, replacing the ageing Spitfires and Mosquitos then in use. Two \"FR.5\"s were built on the F.4 body; one was used for nose section camera tests, the other broke up in midair while in testing over Moreton Valence. On 23 March 1950, the first \"FR.9\" flew. Based on the F.8, it was 20\u00a0cm longer with a new nose incorporating a remote control camera and window and was also fitted with additional external ventral and wing fuel tanks. Production of the FR.9 began in July. No. 208 Squadron, then based at Fayid, Egypt was the first to be upgraded followed by the 2nd Tactical Air Force in West Germany, No. 2 Squadron RAF at B\u00fcckeburg and No. 79 Squadron RAF at RAF Gutersloh flew the FR.9 from 1951 until 1956. In Aden, No. 8 Squadron RAF was given FR.9s in November 1958 and used them until 1961. Ecuador (12), Israel (7) and Syria (2) were foreign customers for the FR.9.\nIn 1951, 29, 141, 85 and 264 squadrons each received a number of NF.11 aircraft, the first of the Meteor night fighters. It was rolled out across the RAF until the final deliveries in 1954. A \"tropicalised\" version of the NF.11 for the Middle East was developed; first flying on 23 December 1952 as the \"NF.13\". The aircraft equipped No. 219 Squadron RAF at Kabrit and No. 39 Squadron at Fayid, both in Egypt. The aircraft served during the Suez crisis and remained with No. 39 Squadron after they were withdrawn to Malta until 1958. Several problems were encountered: the heavily framed T.7 canopy made landings tricky due to limited visibility, the under-wing external fuel tanks tended to break up when the wing cannons were fired, and gun harmonisation, normally set to about 400 yards, was poor due to the wings flexing in flight. Belgium (24), Denmark (20) and France (41) were foreign customers for the NF.11. Ex-RAF NF.13s were sold to France (two), Syria (six), Egypt (six) and Israel (six).\nIn addition to the armed, low altitude operation, tactical FR.9 variant, Gloster also developed the \"PR.10\" for high altitude missions. The first prototype flew on 29 March 1950 and was actually converted into the first production aircraft. Based on the F.4, it had the F.4-style tail and the longer wings of the earlier variant. All the cannons were removed and a single camera placed in the nose with two more in the rear fuselage; the canopy was also changed. The PR.10 was delivered to the RAF in December 1950 and were given to No. 2 and No. 541 squadrons in Germany and No. 13 Squadron RAF in Cyprus. The PR.10 was rapidly phased out from 1956; rapid improvements in surface-to-air missile technology and the introduction of newer aircraft capable of flying at greater altitudes and speeds had rendered the aircraft obsolete.\nArgentina.\nArgentina became the first overseas operator of the Meteor, placing an order for 100 F Mk.4s in May 1947. The Meteor's procurement led to Argentina becoming the second air force in the Americas to operate jet aircraft.\nThe Argentine Meteors were first used in combat during the 16 June 1955 rebellion when, in an attempt to kill Juan Per\u00f3n, rebel-flown aircraft bombed the Casa Rosada. A loyalist Meteor shot down a rebel AT-6, while another strafed rebel-held Ezeiza airport. The rebels seized Mor\u00f3n Airport and Air Base, base of the Meteors, and used several captured aircraft to perform multiple attacks against loyalist forces and the Casa Rosada before the rebellion was defeated by day's end.\nA second revolt, the \"Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora\", broke out on 16 September 1955, with, again, both sides operating the Meteor. The rebels seized three Meteors. Government Meteors flew strafing attacks against the rebel-held destroyers \"Rioja\" and \"Cervantes\", and several landing ships near Rio Santiago on 16 September and attacking Pajas Blancas airport near the city of C\u00f3rdoba, damaging several Avro Lincoln bombers. The rebel-flown Meteors were used to attack loyalist forces attacking C\u00f3rdoba, losing one of their number on 19 September to an engine failure caused by use of automobile petrol instead of jet fuel.\nThe acquisition of F-86 Sabres in 1960 allowed the remaining Meteors to be transferred to the ground attack role. In this role, the aircraft were refitted with bomb pylons and rocket rails; the bare metal colour scheme was also discarded for a camouflage scheme.\nArgentine Meteors were used to attack rebels during attempted uprisings in September 1962 and April 1963. The type was ultimately withdrawn from service in 1970.\nAustralia.\nThe Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) acquired 113 Meteors between 1946 and 1952, 94 of which were the F.8 variant. The first RAAF Meteor was an F.3 delivered for evaluation in June 1946.\nAustralia's F.8s saw extensive service during the Korean War with No. 77 Squadron RAAF, part of British Commonwealth Forces Korea. The squadron had personnel from the RAF and other Commonwealth air forces attached to it. It had arrived in Korea equipped with piston-engined Mustangs. To match the threat posed by MiG-15 jet fighters, it was decided to reequip the squadron with Meteors. Jet conversion training was conducted at Iwakuni, Japan, after which the squadron returned to the Korean theatre in April 1951 with about 30 Meteor F.8s and T.7s. The squadron moved to Kimpo Air Base in June, and was declared combat ready the following month. More advanced designs, such as the F-86 Sabre and Hawker P.1081, were considered but would not be available within a realistic time frame; the Meteor proved to be considerably inferior in combat against the MiG-15 in several respects, including speed and manoeuvrability at high altitude.\nOn 29 July 1951, 77 Squadron began operating their Meteors on combat missions. The squadron had mainly been trained for ground attack and had difficulty when assigned to bomber escort duty at sub-optimum altitudes. On 29 August 1951, eight Meteors were on escort duty in \"MiG Alley\" when they were engaged by six MiG-15s; one Meteor was lost and two were damaged. On 27 October, the squadron achieved its first probable followed by two probables six days later. On 1 December the Battle of Sunchon took place between 14 Meteors and at least 20 MiG-15s \u2013 in North Korean markings but operated secretly by the elite Soviet 176th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment (176 GIAP). The Australians lost three Meteors, with one pilot killed and two captured, while claiming one MiG destroyed and one damaged. Russian records and accounts, which became public after the end of the Cold War, suggested that no MiGs from 176 GIAP were lost.\nAt the end of 1951, due to the superiority of the MiGs in air combat\u00a0\u2013 as well as the Meteor's favourable low-level performance and sturdy construction, RAAF commanders had 77 Squadron returned to ground-attack. In February 1952, more than a thousand ground-attack sorties were flown and these continued until May 1952, when 77 Squadron switched to fighter sweeps. The last encounter between the Meteor and the MiG-15 was in March 1953, during which a Meteor piloted by Sergeant John Hale recorded a victory. By the end of the conflict, the squadron had flown 4,836 missions, destroying six MiG-15s, over 3,500 structures and some 1,500 vehicles. About 30 Meteors were lost to enemy action in Korea, the vast majority shot down by anti-aircraft fire on ground-attack operations.\nThe RAAF began introducing the locally-built CAC Sabre powered by the Rolls-Royce Avon, in 1955, which relegated Meteors to training and secondary duties. A number of Meteors would be assigned to the reserve Citizen Air Force, while others were configured as pilotless drone aircraft or for target towing. No. 75 Squadron RAAF was the last Australian squadron to operate the Meteor; notably, it had operated a three-unit aerobatic team, named \"The Meteorites\".\nEgypt.\nAlthough Egypt's first order for the Meteor was placed in 1948, the rising tension in the region led to the imposition of a series of arms embargoes. Twelve F Mk.4s were eventually delivered between October 1949 and May 1950, along with three T Mk.7s. Twenty-four F Mk.8s were ordered in 1949, but this order was stopped by an embargo. A further order for 12 ex-RAF F.8s was placed in December 1952, of which four were delivered before the order was cancelled, with the final eight being delivered in 1955, along with three more T Mk.7s. and six NF Mk.13s, all ex-RAF aircraft. Britain had allowed the Meteor sales as part of an effort to foster and support good relations; tensions over the Suez Canal led to arms sales being suspended once again.\nEgyptian Meteors participated in the fighting during the Suez Crisis of 1956, typically being used in ground attack missions against Israeli forces. In one incident, an Egyptian Meteor NF Mk.13 claimed to have damaged an RAF Vickers Valiant bomber. An aerial bombing campaign of Egyptian airfields by Anglo-French forces resulted in several aircraft being destroyed on the ground; the Egyptian Air Force subsequently withdrew from combat within the Sinai region.\nSyria.\nMeteors were the first jet aircraft of the fledgling Syrian Air Force. It acquired 25 of them between 1952 and 1956. Although the British were willing to supply aircraft, they did not supply combat training or radar. As Syria became more aligned with Gamal Abdel Nasser and Egypt, British support for Meteor operations was withdrawn and Syrian pilots began training with their Egyptian counterparts. During the Suez Crisis, the RAF performed high altitude reconnaissance flights over Syria by English Electric Canberra aircraft from bases in Cyprus. Lacking radar to track the aircraft, the Syrian Air Force developed a ground spotter network that reported information by telephone to intercept the flights. On 6 November 1956, a Syrian Meteor shot down a Canberra of No. 13 Squadron RAF, which crashed in Lebanon. In 1957, Syria began to replace its Meteors with new MiG-17s from the Soviet Union.\nFrance.\nThe French Air Force was keen to acquire jet aircraft as part of its re-equipment program following the Second World War. In 1953, 25 new-build aircraft were diverted from RAF orders to fulfil a French order; a further 16 ex-RAF NF.11s were purchased in 1954 and delivered between September 1954 and April 1955, these being supplemented by about 14 T Mk.7s. The NF Mk.11s replaced the Mosquito night fighter with the Escadre de Chasse (EC) 30, serving with that Wing until replaced by the Sud Aviation Vautour in 1957. Several Meteors were then transferred to ECN 1/7 in Algeria, which saw combat in the Algerian War, operating from B\u00f4ne, while others were used for training Vautour night fighter crews. The Vautour was retired from French Air Force service in 1964. Five Meteor NF.11s were transferred to the Centre d\u2019Essais en Vol (Flight Test Centre) in 1958, where they were used as equipment testbeds and chase planes, and were later joined by two NF Mk.13s and two NF Mk.14s. The test aircraft were used in a wide variety of experiments, including radar and missile tests and during the development of Concorde.\nIsrael.\nDue to tensions between the newly formed nation of Israel and its neighbours, both sides had commenced an arms race which led to jet aircraft being vigorously purchased by various countries in the region. In 1953 Israel ordered four \"T Mk.7\"s and 11 \"F Mk.8\"s, with delivery continuing until early 1954. The \"F Mk.8\"s were modified to carry American HVAR rockets but were otherwise identical to RAF aircraft. A second batch of seven refurbished \"FR Mk.9\"s and two more \"T Mk.7\"s was delivered in 1955. In 1956, Israel purchased six NF Mk.13s, with three delivered that year, and the remaining three, delayed by an arms embargo, in 1958. Five more T Mk.7s were later purchased, these were converted from ex-Belgian \"F Mk.4\"s and were fitted with the Mk.8 tail.\nOn 1 September 1955, an Israeli Meteor shot down an Egyptian de Havilland Vampire, the first jet aircraft to be shot down in the theatre. The Meteor played a key role during the Suez Crisis; on 28 October 1956, an Israeli NF.13 took part in Operation Tarnegol, in which it successfully located and shot down an Egyptian Ilyushin Il-14 that had been carrying several high-ranking Egyptian military officers on the eve of the crisis. The operation had intended to shoot down the Il-14 that was supposed to be carrying the supreme commander of the Egyptian armed forces, Abdel Hakim Amer, however a different aircraft had been inadvertently attacked and destroyed instead. After deploying paratroopers east of the Suez Canal, the Israeli Air Force continued to support them on the ground predominantly using its jet aircraft, fearing its propeller-driven aircraft would be vulnerable against Egypt's jet fighters.\nWhile initially flying combat air patrol missions, the Meteors and other Israeli aircraft could not prevent effective attacks by Egyptian aircraft on the ground forces. Israeli officers came to recognise that the Meteor was outclassed by Egyptian MiG-15s, and subsequently limited the Meteor's employment as a fighter against other aerial adversaries. Following the start of the Anglo-French bombing campaign against Egyptian airbases, the Egyptian Air Force mostly withdrew from combat in the Sinai, allowing Israeli aircraft to operate unhindered.\nThe Mk.8s remained in front line service until 1956, and were then used as training aircraft. The NF Mk.13s remained in operational use until 1962.\nRecord setting.\nLate in 1945, two F.3 Meteors were modified for an attempt on the world air speed record. On 7 November 1945 at Herne Bay in Kent, UK, Group Captain Hugh \"Willie\" Wilson set the first official air speed record by a jet aircraft of TAS. In 1946, Group Captain Edward \"Teddy\" Donaldson broke this record with a speed of TAS, in \"EE549\", a Meteor F.4.\nOn 4\u20135 April 1950, Sqn Ldr Janusz \u017burakowski set an international speed record London-Copenhagen-London in a production standard F.8 (\"VZ468\"). Suitably impressed, the Danes later purchased the type.\nAnother \"claim to fame\" was the Meteor's ability to perform the \"Zurabatic Cartwheel\", an aerobatics manoeuvre named after Gloster's acting Chief Test Pilot, it was first demonstrated by Meteor G-7-1 \"G-AMCJ\" prototype at the 1951 Farnborough Air Show; the Meteor, due to its widely set engines, could have individual engines throttled back and forward to achieve a seemingly stationary vertical cartwheel. Many Meteor pilots went on to \"prove their mettle\" by attempting the same feat.\nOn 7 August 1949, the Meteor III, \"EE397\", on loan from the RAF and flown by Flight Refuelling Ltd (FRL) test pilot Patrick Hornidge, took off from Tarrant Rushton and, refuelled 10 times by the Lancaster tanker, remained airborne for 12 hours and 3 minutes, receiving of fuel from the tanker in ten tanker contacts and flying an overall distance of , achieving a new jet endurance record.\nMeteor F.8 \"WA820\" was adapted during 1948 to take two Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire turbojets, and from Moreton Valence, on 31 August 1951, established a time-to-height climb record. The pilot was Flt Lt Tom Prickett, of Armstrong Siddeley. A height of 9,843\u00a0ft was reached in 1 min 16 sec, 19,685\u00a0ft in 1 min 50 sec, 29,500\u00a0ft in 2 min 29 sec, and 39,370\u00a0ft in 3 min 7 sec. Air Service Training Ltd were responsible for the conversion.\nPrototypes, eight built:\nFirst production aircraft built between 1943 and 1944, 20 built.\nOne-off engine test bed, converted from former No. 616 Squadron RAF operational F.1 serial number \"EE227\", for the Rolls-Royce Trent turboprop engine making it the world's first turboprop-powered aircraft. The undercarriage was lengthened to give ground clearance for the initial 7 ft 7 inch Rotol airscrews. First flying in September 1945, it was not shown publicly until June 1946. It was found that separate controls for thrust and constant speed units required a lot of skill to manage. It was then flown with higher engine thrust and smaller propellers to enable development of a combined control system. The development programme was complete by 1948.\nAlternative engined version with two Halford H1s \u2013 one of the F.9/40s was used as prototype and trials by de Havilland, did not enter production.\nDerwent I powered, with sliding canopy. First flown 11 September 1944, 210 built (first 15 were Welland-powered).\nDerwent 5 powered with strengthened fuselage, 489 built by Gloster and 46 by Armstrong Whitworth for the Royal Air Force. The F.4 was also exported to Argentina (50 aircraft), Belgium (48 aircraft), Denmark (20 aircraft), Egypt (12 aircraft), Netherlands (38 aircraft).\nOne-off fighter reconnaissance version of the F.4. Fitted with vertical cameras in the nose instead of the four cannon and with oblique cameras in the fuselage. Destroyed on maiden flight, 15 June 1949.\nUnder development in 1946\u20131947 and in all respects a forebear of the later F.8 having the short wings of the F.4 and a fuselage similar to that of the F.8 and an E.1/44 tail assembly. Did not progress beyond the drawing board and not built.\nTwo-seat trainer variant of the F.4, company prototype first flew 19 March 1948, 640 production aircraft for the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy (43) and 72 for export (Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, Egypt, France, Israel, Netherlands). Avions Fairey modified 20 Belgian Air Force F.4s to T.7 standard. Designated T-7 and later TF-7 by the Brazilian Air Force.\nGreatly improved from the F.4. Longer fuselage, greater fuel capacity, standard ejection seat and modified tail (derived from the E.1/44). A prolific frontline fighter in the RAF during 1950\u201354, this variant was ordered by the RAAF, with which it saw action in the Korea War. Designated F-8 by the Brazilian Air Force.\nOne-off experimental Meteor F.8 \"prone pilot\", \"WK935\" modified by Armstrong Whitworth.\nFighter armed reconnaissance version of the F.8, first flown 23 March 1950, 126 built by Gloster for the Royal Air Force. Former RAF aircraft were later sold to Ecuador, Israel and Syria.\nPhoto reconnaissance version of the F.8, first flown 29 March 1950, 59 built for the Royal Air Force.\nNight Fighter variant with airborne interception (AI) radar designed and built by Armstrong Whitworth, three prototypes followed by 311 production aircraft for the Royal Air Force and 20 for the Royal Danish Air Force.\nLonger-nosed version of the NF.11 with American AN/APS-21 radar, this was balanced by a slightly larger fin, first flown on 21 April 1953, 100 built by Armstrong Whitworth.\n\"Tropicalised\" version of the NF.11 to replace the Mosquito NF.36 for service with 39 Squadron in Malta and Cyprus and 219 Squadron based in Egypt. The first of 40 production aircraft built by Armstrong Whitworth was first flown on 21 December 1952. Former Royal Air Force aircraft were later sold to Egypt (6 aircraft), France (2 aircraft), Israel (6 aircraft) and Syria (6 aircraft).\nNF.11 with new two-piece blown canopy rather than the heavy-framed version. It also had a longer nose giving a length of 51 ft 4 in.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, each cable was a single wire. After mid-century, coaxial cable came into use, with amplifiers. Late in the 20th century, all cables installed use optical fiber as well as optical amplifiers, because distances range thousands of kilometers.\nHistory.\nWhen the first transatlantic telegraph cable was laid in 1858 by Cyrus West Field, it operated for only three weeks; a subsequent attempt in 1866 was more successful. On July 13, 1866 the cable laying ship \"Great Eastern\" sailed out of Valentia Island, Ireland and on July 27 landed at Heart's Content in Newfoundland, completing the first lasting connection across the Atlantic. It was active until 1965. \nAlthough a telephone cable was discussed starting in the 1920s, to be practical it needed a number of technological advances which did not arrive until the 1940s. Starting in 1927, transatlantic telephone service was radio-based.\nTAT-1 (Transatlantic No. 1) was the first transatlantic telephone cable system. It was laid between Gallanach Bay, near Oban, and Clarenville, Newfoundland between 1955 and 1956 by the cable ship \"Monarch\". It was inaugurated on September 25, 1956, initially carrying 36 telephone channels. In the first 24 hours of public service, there were 588 London\u2013U.S. calls and 119 from London to Canada. The capacity of the cable was soon increased to 48 channels. Later, an additional three channels were added by use of C Carrier equipment. Time-assignment speech interpolation (TASI) was implemented on the TAT-1 cable in June 1960 and effectively increased the cable's capacity from 37 (out of 51 available channels) to 72 speech circuits. TAT-1 was finally retired in 1978. Later coaxial cables, installed through the 1970s, used transistors and had higher bandwidth. The Moscow\u2013Washington hotline was initially connected through this system.\nCurrent technology.\nAll cables presently in service use fiber optic technology. Many cables terminate in Newfoundland and Ireland, which lie on the great circle route from London, UK to New York City, US.\nThere has been a succession of newer transatlantic cable systems. All recent systems have used fiber optic transmission, and a self-healing ring topology. Late in the 20th century, communications satellites lost most of their North Atlantic telephone traffic to these low-cost, high-capacity, low-latency cables. This advantage only increases over time, as tighter cables provide higher bandwidth \u2013 the 2012 generation of cables drop the transatlantic latency to under 60 milliseconds, according to Hibernia Atlantic, deploying such a cable that year.\nSome new cables are being announced on the South Atlantic: SACS (South Atlantic Cable System) and SAex (South Atlantic Express).\nTAT cable routes.\nThe TAT series of cables constitute a large percentage of all North Atlantic cables. All TAT cables are joint ventures between a number of telecommunications companies, e.g. British Telecom. CANTAT cables terminate in Canada rather than in the US.\nPrivate cable routes.\nThere are a number of private non-TAT cables.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It follows the story of a fictional rock band in Philadelphia that tries to get a recording contract, starring John Stamos in the lead as Gino Minnelli, a 22-year-old welder who plays guitar for rock band Dreams outside his regular job. Jami Gertz co-stars as lead singer Martha Spino.\nInspired by the growing popularity of music videos in the early 1980s, the show incorporated music video aesthetics in each episode, with executive producer Jon Peters previously having produced \"Flashdance\". However, the show was negatively reviewed by critics and was canceled after five episodes. Stamos and Gertz would go on to success in later work, and one song performed in the show, \"Alone\", would become a number-one hit in 1987 for rock group Heart.\nPremise.\nGino Minnelli, a 22-year-old welder in Philadelphia, performs as a guitarist with rock band Dreams when not at his regular job. The show \"combin[ed] situation comedy with the flourishing popularity of music videos.\" Additionally, \"Dreams\" was the first U.S. network television show to broadcast in stereo sound.\nExecutive producer Jon Peters previously produced \"Flashdance\", a 1983 film that incorporated music video editing with the story.\nBroadcast.\nCBS scheduled \"Dreams\" on Wednesdays at 8:30\u00a0p.m. beginning October 3, 1984. However, due to poor ratings, CBS removed \"Dreams\" after the October 31 episode.\nReception.\n\"Dreams\" encountered negative critical reception. In the summer of 1984, ad agency Dancer Fitzgerald Sample ranked the show among the least likely to succeed in the upcoming television season, believing the show to be childish (\"exclusively kidvid\").\nFor \"The New York Times\", John J. O'Connor found similarities between \"Dreams\" and \"Happy Days\", regarding Stamos's character of Gino as a \"straightforward resurrection\" of Henry Winkler's Fonzie \"in the \"Flashdance\" mode\". However, O'Connor was critical of Gino's character development: \"...without a nice-guy Richie for a foil, Gino comes across less irresistible than obnoxious.\" O'Connor also called the show \"a kind of extended music-video punctuated with dopey dialogue.\"\nTom Shales of \"The Washington Post\" called \"Dreams\" a \"weak and creaky sitcom\".\nHowever, David Bianculli of \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" had a more mixed review: \"The pilot works, barely, but later episodes will tell if this is a cult item or a commercial cop-out.\" Later in the show's run, Bianculli pointed out the sanitized nature of \"Dreams\" on CBS in contrast to the group's music videos on MTV: \"The paradox here is that rock music, by definition, is supposed to be uninhibited and loose, while network television has censors on its payroll. If \"Dreams\" were afforded a little more freedom, the show would be a lot more fun to watch.\"\nLegacy.\nIn 2016, Bob Leszczak called \"Dreams\" \"an expensive and ambitious flop\".\nThe two lead cast members would find success in other ventures after the short run of \"Dreams\". Stamos played Jesse Katsopolis on sitcom \"Full House\" from 1988 to 1995. on ABC. \"Full House\" was a popular show on ABC's \"TGIF\" lineup, reaching the top ten of Nielsen ratings in 1991\u201392.\nFrom 2002 to 2006, Gertz portrayed Judy Miller on the CBS sitcom \"Still Standing\".

{"id": "42707", "revid": "1268523", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42707", "title": "Frank Whittle", "text": "British Royal Air Force engineer and air officer (1907\u20131996)\nAir Commodore Sir Frank Whittle, (1 June 1907 \u2013 8 August 1996) was an English engineer, inventor and Royal Air Force (RAF) air officer. He is credited with co-creating the turbojet engine. A patent was submitted by Maxime Guillaume in 1921 for a similar invention which was technically unfeasible at the time. Whittle's jet engines were developed some years earlier than those of Germany's Hans von Ohain, who designed the first-to-fly turbojet engine as well as Austria\u2019s Anselm Franz.\nWhittle demonstrated an aptitude for engineering and an interest in flying from an early age. At first he was turned down by the RAF but, determined to join the force, he overcame his physical limitations and was accepted and sent to No. 2 School of Technical Training to join No 1 Squadron of Cranwell Aircraft Apprentices. He was taught the theory of aircraft engines and gained practical experience in the engineering workshops. His academic and practical abilities as an Aircraft Apprentice earned him a place on the officer training course at Cranwell. He excelled in his studies and became an accomplished pilot. While writing his thesis he formulated the fundamental concepts that led to the creation of the turbojet engine, taking out a patent on his design in 1930. His performance on an officers' engineering course earned him a place on a further course at Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he graduated with a First.\nWithout Air Ministry support, he and two retired RAF servicemen formed Power Jets Ltd to build his engine with assistance from the firm of British Thomson-Houston. Despite limited funding, a prototype was created, which first ran in 1937. Official interest was forthcoming following this success, with contracts being placed to develop further engines, but the continuing stress seriously affected Whittle's health, eventually resulting in a nervous breakdown in 1940. In 1944 when Power Jets was nationalised he again suffered a nervous breakdown, and resigned from the board in 1946.\nIn 1948, Whittle retired from the RAF and received a knighthood. He joined BOAC as a technical advisor before working as an engineering specialist with Shell, followed by a position with Bristol Aero Engines. After emigrating to the U.S. in 1976 he accepted the position of NAVAIR Research Professor at the United States Naval Academy from 1977 to 1979. In August 1996, Whittle died of lung cancer at his home in Columbia, Maryland. In 2002, Whittle was ranked number 42 in the BBC poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.\nEarly life.\nWhittle was born in a terraced house in Newcombe Road, Earlsdon, Coventry, England, on 1 June 1907, the eldest son of Moses Whittle and Sara Alice Garlick. When he was nine years old, the family moved to the nearby town of Royal Leamington Spa where his father, a highly inventive practical engineer and mechanic, purchased the Leamington Valve and Piston Ring Company in Clinton Street, which comprised a few lathes and other tools and a single-cylinder gas engine, on which Whittle became an expert. Whittle developed a rebellious and adventurous streak, together with an early interest in aviation.\nAfter two years attending Milverton School, Whittle won a scholarship to a secondary school which in due course became Leamington College for Boys, but when his father's business faltered there was not enough money to keep him there. He quickly developed practical engineering skills while helping in his father's workshop, and being an enthusiastic reader spent much of his spare time in the Leamington reference library, reading about astronomy, engineering, turbines, and the theory of flight. At the age of 15, determined to be a pilot, Whittle applied to join the RAF.\nEntering the RAF.\nIn January 1923, having passed the RAF entrance examination with a high mark, Whittle reported to RAF Halton in Buckinghamshire as an Aircraft Apprentice. He lasted only two days: just five feet tall and with a small chest measurement, he failed the medical. He then put himself through a vigorous training programme and special diet devised by a physical training instructor at Halton to build up his physique, only to fail again six months later, when he was told that he could not be given a second chance, despite having added three inches to his height and chest. Undeterred, he applied again under an assumed name and presented himself as a candidate at the No 2 School of Technical Training RAF Cranwell. This time he passed the physical and, in September that year, 364365 Boy Whittle, F, started his three-year training as an aircraft mechanic in No. 1 Squadron of No. 4 Apprentices Wing, RAF Cranwell, because RAF Halton No. 1 School of Technical Training was unable to accommodate all the aircraft apprentices at that time.\nWhittle hated the strict discipline imposed on apprentices and, convinced there was no hope of ever becoming a pilot, he at one time seriously considered deserting. However, throughout his early days as an aircraft apprentice (and at the Royal Air Force College Cranwell), he maintained his interest in model aircraft and joined the Model Aircraft Society, where he built working replicas. The quality of these attracted the eye of the Apprentice Wing commanding officer, who noted that Whittle was also a mathematical genius. He was so impressed that in 1926 he recommended Whittle for officer training at RAF College Cranwell.\nFor Whittle, this was the chance of a lifetime, not only to enter the commissioned ranks but also because the training included flying lessons on the Avro 504. While at Cranwell he lodged in a bungalow at Dorrington. Being an ex-apprentice amongst a majority of ex-public schoolboys, life as an officer cadet was not easy for him, but he nevertheless excelled in the courses and went solo in 1927 after only 13.5 hours\u2019 instruction, quickly progressing to the Bristol Fighter and gaining a reputation for daredevil low flying and aerobatics.\nA requirement of the course was that each student had to produce a thesis for graduation: Whittle decided to write his on potential aircraft design developments, notably flight at high altitudes and speeds over 500\u00a0mph (800\u00a0km/h). In \"Future Developments in Aircraft Design\" he showed that incremental improvements in existing propeller engines were unlikely to make such flight routine. Instead he described what is today referred to as a motorjet; an air compressor using a conventional piston engine to provide compressed air to a combustion chamber whose exhaust was used directly for thrust \u2013 essentially an afterburner attached to a piston engine driven air compressor. The idea was not new and had been talked about for some time in the industry, but Whittle's aim was to demonstrate that at increased altitudes the lower outside air density would increase the design's efficiency. For long-range flight, using an Atlantic-crossing mailplane as his example, the engine would spend most of its time at high altitude and thus could outperform a conventional powerplant. According to Whittle, \"...I came to the general conclusion that if very high speeds were to be combined with long range, it would be necessary to fly at very great height, where the low air density would greatly reduce resistance in proportion to speed.\"\nOf the few apprentices accepted into the Royal Air Force College, Whittle graduated in 1928 at the age of 21 and was commissioned as a pilot officer in July. He ranked second in his class in academics, won the Andy Fellowes Memorial Prize for Aeronautical Sciences for his thesis, and was described as an \"exceptional to above average\" pilot. However, his flight logbook also showed numerous red ink warnings about showboating and overconfidence, and because of dangerous flying in an Armstrong Whitworth Siskin he was disqualified from the end-of-term flying contest.\nDevelopment of the turbojet engine.\nWhittle continued working on the motorjet principle after his thesis work but eventually abandoned it when further calculations showed it would weigh as much as a conventional engine of the same thrust. Pondering the problem he thought: \"Why not substitute a turbine for the piston engine?\" Instead of using a piston engine driven compressor to provide the compressed air for the burner, a turbine could be used to extract some power from the exhaust and drive a compressor, similar as in a turbocharger. The remaining exhaust thrust would power the aircraft.\nOn 27 August 1928, Pilot Officer Whittle joined No. 111 Squadron, Hornchurch, flying Siskin IIIs. His continuing reputation for low flying and aerobatics provoked a public complaint that almost led to his being court-martialled. Within a year he was posted to the Central Flying School, then at RAF Wittering, for a flying instructor's course. He became a popular and gifted instructor, and was selected as one of the entrants in a competition to select a team to perform the \"crazy flying\" routine in the 1930 Royal Air Force Air Display at RAF Hendon. He destroyed two aircraft in accidents during rehearsals but remained unscathed on both occasions. After the second incident an enraged Flight Lieutenant Harold W. Raeburn said furiously, \"Why don't you take all my bloody aeroplanes, make a heap of them in the middle of the aerodrome and set fire to them \u2013 it's quicker!\"\nWhittle showed his engine concept around the base, where it attracted the attention of Flying Officer Pat Johnson, formerly a patent examiner. Johnson, in turn, took the concept to the commanding officer of the base. This set in motion a chain of events that almost led to the engines being produced much sooner than actually occurred.\nEarlier, in July 1926, A. A. Griffith had published a paper on compressors and turbines, which he had been studying at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE). He showed that such designs up to this point had been flying \"stalled\", and that by giving the compressor blades an aerofoil-shaped cross-section their efficiency could be dramatically improved. The paper went on to describe how the increased efficiency of these sorts of compressors and turbines would allow a jet engine to be produced, although he felt the idea was impractical, and instead suggested using the power as a turboprop. At the time most superchargers used a centrifugal compressor, so there was limited interest in the paper.\nEncouraged by his commanding officer, in late 1929 Whittle sent his concept to the Air Ministry to see if it would be of any interest to them. Whittle was invited to the Ministry and met an officer of the Ministry's Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) and Griffith (at the time a member of the Aeronautical Research Committee). Afterwards, Whittle received a letter from Griffith, who was of the opinion that Whittle's \"simple\" design could not achieve the sort of efficiencies needed for a practical engine. After pointing out an error in one of Whittle's calculations, Griffith went on to comment that the centrifugal design would be too large for aircraft use and that using the jet directly for power would be rather inefficient. Griffith called the design \"impracticable,\" as current materials could not achieve the high temperatures. Griffith did say \"the internal combustion turbine will almost certainly be developed into a successful engine, but before this can be done the performance of both compressors and turbines will have to be greatly improved. However it has been of real interest to investigate your scheme and I can assure you that any suggestion submitted by people in the Service is always welcome.\"\nWhittle received a report noting the limitations his concept. The report said \"the internal combustion turbine will not be rendered practical by the revolutionary design of some lucky inventor. The steam turbine engineer and the metallurgist ... are the people with whom the future development of the turbine rests\" Whittle recorded that he found the response depressing.\nPat Johnson remained convinced of the validity of the idea, and had Whittle patent the idea in January 1930. Since the RAF was not interested in the concept they did not declare it secret, meaning that Whittle was able to retain the rights to the idea, which would have otherwise been their property. Johnson arranged a meeting with British Thomson-Houston (BTH), whose chief turbine engineer seemed to agree with the basic idea. However, BTH did not want to spend the \u00a360,000 it would cost to develop it, and this potential brush with early success went no further.\nIn January 1930, Whittle was promoted to flying officer. In Coventry, on 24 May 1930, Whittle married his fianc\u00e9e, Dorothy Mary Lee, with whom he later had two sons, David and Ian. Then, in 1931, he was posted to the Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment at Felixstowe as an armament officer and test pilot of seaplanes, where he continued to publicise his idea. This posting came as a surprise for he had never previously flown a seaplane, but he nevertheless increased his reputation as a pilot by flying some 20 different types of floatplanes, flying boats, and amphibians.\nWhile at Felixstowe, Whittle met with the firm of Armstrong Siddeley, and their technical advisor W.S. Farren. The firm rejected Whittle's proposal, doubting material was available to sustain the required very high temperatures. Whittle's turbojet proposal required a compressor with a pressure ratio of 4:1, while the best current supercharger had only half that value. Besides publishing a paper on superchargers, Whittle wrote The Case for the Gas Turbine. According to John Golley, \"The paper contained example calculations which showed the big increase in efficiency which could be obtained with the gas turbine at great height due to the beneficial effects of low air temperature. It also contained calculations to demonstrate the degree to which range would depend on height with turbojet aircraft.\"\nEvery officer with a permanent commission was expected to take a specialist course, and as a result Whittle attended the Officers School of Engineering at RAF Henlow in 1932. He obtained an aggregate of 98% in all subjects in his entrance exam, which allowed him to complete a shortened one-year course. Whittle received a Distinction in every subject, except mechanical drawing, where he was described as \"a very able student. He works hard and has originality. He is suitable for experimental duties.\"\nHis performance in the course was so exceptional that in 1934 he was permitted, though the scheme for RAF officers had been ended the year before, to take a two-year engineering course as a member of Peterhouse, the oldest college of Cambridge University, graduating in 1936 with a First in the Mechanical Sciences Tripos. The Ministry gave him permission to spend a further year after graduation working with the aerodynamicist Melvill Jones. On 1 February 1934, he was promoted to the rank of flight lieutenant.\nPower Jets Ltd.\nStill at Cambridge, Whittle could ill afford the \u00a35 renewal fee for his jet engine patent when it became due in January 1935, and because the Air Ministry refused to pay it the patent was allowed to lapse. Shortly afterwards, in May, he received mail from Rolf Dudley-Williams, who had been with him at Cranwell in the 1920s and Felixstowe in 1930. Williams arranged a meeting with Whittle, himself, and another by-then-retired RAF serviceman, James Collingwood Tinling. The two proposed a partnership that allowed them to act on Whittle's behalf to gather public financing so that development could go ahead. Whittle thought improvements to his original idea could be patented, noting, \"Its virtue lies entirely in its extremely low weight, and that it will work at heights where atmospheric density is very low.\" This led to three provisional specifications being filed, as the group sought to develop a jet-propelled aeroplane. The arrangement was that Williams and Tinling would have a quarter share each of the commercial rights but they would not approach any existing company in the aircraft industry.\nThe agreement soon bore fruit, and in 1935, through Tinling's father, Whittle was introduced to Mogens L. Bramson, a well-known independent consulting aeronautical engineer and patent engineer. Bramson was initially sceptical but after studying Whittle's ideas became an enthusiastic supporter. Bramson introduced Whittle and his two associates to the investment bank O.T. Falk &amp; Partners, where discussions took place with Lancelot Law Whyte and occasionally Sir Maurice Bonham-Carter. The firm had an interest in developing speculative projects that conventional banks would not touch. Whyte was impressed by the 28-year-old Whittle and his design when they met on 11 September 1935:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The impression he made was overwhelming, I have never been so quickly convinced, or so happy to find one's highest standards met... This was genius, not talent. Whittle expressed his idea with superb conciseness: 'Reciprocating engines are exhausted. They have hundreds of parts jerking to and fro, and they cannot be made more powerful without becoming too complicated. The engine of the future must produce 2,000\u00a0hp with one moving part: a spinning turbine and compressor.'\nHowever O.T. Falk &amp; Partners specified they would only invest in Whittle's engine if they had independent verification that it was feasible. They financed an independent engineering review from Bramson (the historic \"Bramson Report\"), which was issued in November 1935. It was favourable and together with a letter of support for Whittle and the engine from Henry Tizard (chair of the Engine sub-committee of the Aeronautical Research Committee) in response to Whyte Falk then agreed to finance Whittle. With that the jet engine was finally on its way to becoming a reality.\nOn 27 January 1936, the principals signed the \"Four Party Agreement\", creating \"Power Jets Ltd\" which was incorporated in March 1936. The parties were O.T. Falk &amp; Partners, the Air Ministry, Whittle and, together, Williams and Tinling. Falk was represented on the board of Power Jets by Whyte as chairman and Bonham-Carter as a director (with Bramson acting as alternate). Whittle, Williams and Tinling retained a 49% share of the company in exchange for Falk and Partners putting in \u00a32,000 with the option of a further \u00a318,000 within 18 months. As Whittle was still a full-time RAF officer and currently at Cambridge, he was given the title \"Honorary Chief Engineer and Technical Consultant\". Needing special permission to work outside the RAF, he was placed on the Special Duty List and allowed to work on the design as long as it was for no more than six hours a week. However he was allowed to continue at Cambridge for a year doing post-graduate work which gave him time to work on the turbojet.\nThe Air Ministry still saw little immediate value in the effort (they regarded it as long-range research and set up work on an axial flow turbine at the RAE with Hayne Constant in 1937), and having no production facilities of its own, Power Jets entered into an agreement with steam turbine specialists British Thomson-Houston (BTH) to build an experimental engine facility at a BTH factory in Rugby, Warwickshire. Work progressed quickly, and by the end of the year 1936 the prototype detail design was finalised and parts for it were well on their way to being completed, all within the original \u00a32,000 budget. However, by 1936, Germany had also started working on jet engines (Herbert A. Wagner at Junkers and Hans von Ohain at Heinkel) and, although they too had difficulty overcoming conservatism, the German Ministry of Aviation (Reichsluftfahrtministerium) was more supportive than their British counterpart. Von Ohain applied for a patent for a turbojet engine in 1935 but having earlier reviewed and critiqued Whittle's patents, had to narrow the scope of his own filing. In Spain, air-force pilot and engineer Virgilio Leret Ruiz had been granted a patent for a jet engine in March 1935, and Republican president Manuel Aza\u00f1a arranged for initial construction at the Hispano-Suiza aircraft factory in Madrid in 1936, but Leret was executed months later by Francoist Moroccan troops after commanding the defence of his seaplane base near Melilla at the onset of the Spanish Civil War. His plans were hidden from the Francoists and secretly handed to the British embassy in Madrid a few years later when his wife, Carlota O'Neill, was released from prison.\nDespite lengthy delays in their own programme, the Luftwaffe beat the British efforts into the air by nine months. A lack of cobalt for high-temperature steel alloys meant the German designs were always at risk of overheating and damaging their turbines. The low-grade alloy production versions of the Junkers Jumo 004, designed by Dr. Anselm Franz and which powered the Messerschmitt Me 262 would typically last only 10\u201325\u00a0hours (longer with an experienced pilot) before burning out; if it was accelerated too quickly, the compressor would stall and power was immediately lost, and sometimes it exploded on their first startup. Over 200 German pilots were killed during training. Nevertheless, the Me 262 could fly far faster than allied planes and had very effective firepower. Although Me 262s were introduced late in the war they shot down 542 or more allied planes and in one allied bombing raid downed 32 of the 36 Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses.\nFinancial difficulty.\nEarlier, in January, when the company formed, Henry Tizard, the rector of Imperial College London and chairman of the Aeronautical Research Committee (ARC), had prompted the Air Ministry's Director of Scientific Research to ask for a write-up of the design. The report was once again passed on to Griffith for comment, but was not received back until March 1937 by which point Whittle's design was well along. Griffith had already started construction of his own turbine engine design and, perhaps to avoid tainting his own efforts, he returned a somewhat more positive review. However, he remained highly critical of some features, notably the use of jet thrust. The Engine Sub-Committee of ARC studied Griffith's report, and decided to fund Griffith's effort instead. Given this astonishing display of official indifference, Falk and Partners gave notice that they could not provide funding beyond \u00a35,000.\nNevertheless, the team pressed ahead, and the Power Jets WU (Whittle Unit, or W.U.) engine began test runs on 12 April 1937. Initially, the W.U. showed an alarming tendency to race out of control, due to issues with the fuel injection, before stable speeds were reached. However, by August, Whittle acknowledged a major reconstruction effort was needed to solve the combustion problem and compressor efficiency.\nOn 9 July, Falk &amp; Partners gave the company an emergency loan of \u00a3250. On 27 July, Falk's option expired, but they agreed to continue financing Power Jets by loan. Also in July, Whittle's post-graduate stay at Cambridge was over, but then he was placed on the Special Duty List so he could work full-time on the engine. On 1 November, Williams, Tinling and Whittle took control of Power Jets. Whittle was promoted to squadron leader in December. Tizard pronounced it \"streaks ahead\" of any other advanced engine he had seen, and managed to interest the Air Ministry enough to fund development with a contract for \u00a35,000 to develop a flyable version. However, it was not until March 1938 that a contract was signed, when Power Jets became subject to the Official Secrets Act, limiting the ability to raise additional funds. In January 1938, BTH invested \u00a32,500.\nIn December 1937, Victor Crompton became Power Jets\u2019 first employee, as an assistant to Whittle. Because of the hazardous nature of the work being carried out, development was moved largely from Rugby to BTH's lightly used Ladywood foundry at nearby Lutterworth in Leicestershire in 1938. Tests with a reconstructed W.U. engine commenced on 16 April 1938, and proceeded until a catastrophic failure of the turbine on 6 May. Yet, the engine ran for 1 hour and 45 minutes, and generated a thrust of at 13,000 rpm. Another W.U. engine reconstruction was started on 30 May 1938, but using ten combustion chambers to match the ten compressor discharge ducts. Avoiding a single large combustion chamber made the engine lighter and more compact. Tests commenced with this third W.U. on 26 October 1938.\nThese delays and the lack of funding slowed the project. In Germany, Hans von Ohain had filed for a patent in 1935, which in 1939, led to the world's first flyable jet aircraft, the Heinkel He 178, powered by the Heinkel HeS 3. There is little doubt that Whittle's efforts would have been at the same level or even more advanced had the Air Ministry taken a greater interest in the design. When war broke out in September 1939, Power Jets had a payroll of only 10 and Griffith's operations at the RAE and Metropolitan-Vickers were similarly small.\nWhittle's smoking increased to three packs a day and he suffered from various stress-related ailments such as frequent severe headaches, indigestion, insomnia, anxiety, eczema and heart palpitations, while his weight dropped to nine\u00a0stone (126\u00a0lb / 57\u00a0kg). To keep to his 16-hour workdays, he sniffed benzedrine during the day and then took tranquillisers and sleeping pills at night to offset the effects and allow him to sleep. He admitted later he had become addicted to benzedrine. Over this period he became irritable and developed an \"explosive\" temper.\nChanging fortunes.\nOn 30 June 1939, Power Jets could barely afford to keep the lights on when yet another visit was made by Air Ministry personnel. This time Whittle was able to run the third reconstructed W.U. at 16,000 rpm for 20\u00a0minutes without any difficulty. One of the members of the team was the Director of Scientific Research, David Randall Pye, who walked out of the demonstration utterly convinced of the importance of the project. The Ministry agreed to buy the W.U. and then lend it back to them, injecting cash, and placed an order for a flyable version of the engine, referred to as the Power Jets W.1 and Power Jets W.2. By then, the Ministry had a tentative contract with the Gloster Aircraft Company for a simple aircraft specifically to flight-test the W.1, the single-engine Gloster E.28/39.\nWhittle had already studied the problem of turning the massive W.U. into a flyable design, with what he described as very optimistic targets, to power a little aeroplane weighing 2,000 lb with a static thrust of 1,389 lb. The designed maximum thrust for the W.1 was , while that for the W.2, was The W.2 was to be flown in the twin-engine Gloster Meteor fighter, at the time known by its Air Ministry specification as the F.9/40, but the engine was replaced with the W.2B, having a designed static thrust of . An experimental version of the W.1, designated W.1X, was used as a mock-up for the E.28 installation. A second E.28 was powered by the W.1A, that incorporated W.2 features such as air cooling of the turbine and a different compressor intake. On 26 March 1940, the jet engine was listed as a potential war winner by Air Marshal Tedder, and given the associated priority.\nPower Jets also spent some time in May 1940 drawing up the W.2Y, a similar design with a \"straight-through\" airflow that resulted in a longer engine and, more critically, a longer driveshaft but having a somewhat simpler layout. To reduce the weight of the driveshaft as much as possible, the W.2Y used a large diameter, thin-walled, shaft almost as large as the turbine disc, \"necked down\" at either end where it connected to the turbine and compressor.\nIn April, the Air Ministry issued contracts for W.2 production lines with a capacity of up to 3,000 engines a month in 1942, asking BTH, Vauxhall and the Rover Company to join. However, the contract was eventually taken up by Rover only. In June, Whittle received a promotion to wing commander.\nOn 19 July 1940, Power Jets abandoned effort to vaporize fuel, and adopted the controlled atomising burner for the combustion chamber, developed by Isaac Lubbock of Asiatic Petroleum Company (a joint venture of Shell and Royal Dutch) In the words of Whittle, \"the introduction of the Shell system may be said to mark the point where combustion ceased to be an obstacle to development.\" The size of Power Jets also increased with the war effort, increasing from 25 employees in January 1940 to 70 in September 1940.\nRover.\nMeanwhile, work continued with the W.U., which eventually went through nine rebuilds in an attempt to solve the combustion problems that had dominated the testing. On 9 October the W.U. ran once again, this time equipped with Lubbock or \"Shell\" atomising-burner combustion chambers. Combustion problems ceased to be an obstacle to development of the engine although intensive development was started on all features of the new combustion chambers.\nBy this point it was clear that Gloster's first airframe would be ready long before Rover could deliver an engine. Unwilling to wait, Whittle cobbled together an engine from spare parts, creating the W.1X (\"X\" standing for \"experimental\") which ran for the first time on 14 December 1940. Shortly afterwards an application for a US patent was made by Power Jets for an \"Aircraft propulsion system and power unit\"\nThe W.1X engine powered the E.28/39 for taxi testing on 7 April 1941 at Brockworth near the factory in Gloucester, where it took to the air for two or three short hops of several hundred yards at about six feet from the ground.\nThe definitive W.1 of 850\u00a0lbf (3.8\u00a0kN) thrust ran on 12 April 1941, and on 15 May the W.1-powered E.28/39 took off from Cranwell at 7:40\u00a0pm, flying for 17\u00a0minutes and reaching a maximum speed of around 340\u00a0mph (545\u00a0km/h). At the end of the flight, Pat Johnson, who had encouraged Whittle for so long said to him, \"Frank, it flies.\" Whittle replied, \"Well, that's what it was bloody well designed to do, wasn't it?\"\nWithin days the aircraft was reaching 370\u00a0mph (600\u00a0km/h) at 25,000\u00a0feet (7,600\u00a0m), exceeding the performance of the contemporary Supermarine Spitfire fighters. Success of the design was now evident, and in 1941, Rolls-Royce, Hawker Siddeley, the Bristol Aeroplane Company, and de Havilland became interested in gas turbine aircraft propulsion. Under Harold Roxbee Cox, the Gas Turbine Collaboration Committee was created to give a forum for all the companies for exchange of information.\nThe stress on Whittle was expressed in a 27 May 1941 letter to Henry Tizard:\nIn mid-1941, relations between Power Jets and Rover had continued to deteriorate. Rover had established a version of Power Jet's set-up at Waterloo Mill, associated with their Barnoldswick factory, near Clitheroe. Rover was working on an alternative to Whittle's \"reverse-flow\" combustion chambers, by developing a \"straight-through\" combustion chamber and turbine wheel. Rover referred to the engine as the B.26, sanctioned by the Directorate of Engine Development, but kept secret until April 1942, from Power Jets, the Controller of Research and Development, and the Director of Scientific Research.\nRolls-Royce.\nEarlier, in January 1940, Whittle had met Dr Stanley Hooker of Rolls-Royce, who in turn introduced Whittle to Rolls-Royce board member and manager of their Derby factory, Ernest Hives (later Lord Hives). Hooker was in charge of the supercharger division at Rolls-Royce Derby and was a specialist in fluid dynamics. He had already increased the power of the Merlin piston engine by improving its supercharger. Such a speciality was naturally suited to the aero-thermodynamics of jet engines in which the optimisation of airflow in compressor, combustion chambers, turbine and jet pipe, is fundamental. Hives agreed to supply key parts to help the project. Also, Rolls-Royce built a compressor test rig which helped Whittle solve the surging problems (unstable airflow in the compressor) on the W.2 engine.\nOn 10 December 1941 Whittle suffered a nervous breakdown, and left work for a month. However, by the end of January 1942, Power Jets had three W.2B engines, two built by Rover. In February 1942, flight trials of the W.1A engine began in the E.28, which reached 430\u00a0mph (690\u00a0km/h) at 15,000\u00a0feet (4,600\u00a0m). On 13 March 1942, Whittle started work on a redesign of the W.2B, referred to as the W.2/500. \nOn 13 September 1942, W.2/500 performance tests matched predictions, showing a thrust of at full speed. In October 1941, the Ministry approved a new factory to be built outside Whetstone, Leicestershire.\nFrom 3 June until 14 August 1942 Whittle visited the United States. At the General Electric's Lynn Factory, Whittle reviewed the Type I Supercharger, GE's code name for their jet engine, based on Power Jets' W.1X. An improved version of the W.2B would also be built, called the I-16, incorporating features of the W.2/500. Whittle also toured the Bell Aircraft, and the three Bell XP-59A Airacomets, a twin-engine fighter powered by the General Electric I-A jet engines. This fighter took flight in October 1942, one year and one day after GE received Power Jets' W.1X.\nOn 11 December 1942 Whittle had a meeting with the chief executive of the Ministry of Aircraft Production Air Chief Marshal Wilfrid Freeman and Air Marshal Francis Linnell, Controller of Research and Development at MAP, According to Whittle, \"He made it clear that he had definitely decided to transfer Barnoldswick and Clitheroe to Rolls-Royce management.\" Spencer Wilks of Rover met with Hives and Hooker at the \"Swan and Royal\" pub, in Clitheroe, near the Barnoldswick factory. By arrangement with the Ministry of Aircraft Production they traded the jet factory at Barnoldswick for Rolls-Royce's tank engine factory in Nottingham.Testing and production ramp-up was immediately accelerated. Adrian Lombard Rover's supervising engineer on the Whittle engines transferred to Rolls Royce to continue the role. By January 1943, Rolls-Royce had achieved 400 hours of run time, ten times Rover's number of the previous month, and in May 1943, the W.2B passed its first 100-hour development test at of thrust.\nWhen Rolls-Royce became involved, Ray Dorey, the manager of the company's Flight Centre at Hucknall Airfield on the north side of Nottingham, had a Whittle W.2B engine installed in the rear of a Vickers Wellington bomber. The installation was done by Vickers at Weybridge.\nFrom the end of 1937, when a Squadron Leader, he lived at 'Broomfield' on Bilton Road, in Rugby. Both sons were at school in the town. He later briefly lived at 'Laurelcroft', 1 North Street, Kilsby until 1949. His two sons went to Rossall School in Blackpool. Ian later joined the RAF.\nContinued impact.\nWhittle wanted to improve the efficiency of the jet engine at lower speeds. According to Whittle, \"I wanted to 'gear down the jet', ie to convert a low-mass high-velocity jet into a high-mass low-velocity jet. The obvious way to do this was to use an additional turbine to extract energy from the jet and use this energy to drive a low-pressure compressor or fan capable of 'breathing' far more air than the jet engine itself and forcing this additional air rearwards as a 'cold jet'. The complete system is known as a 'turbofan'.\" The first embodiment was referred to as a No 1 Thrust Augmentor, which consisted of an \"aft fan\", or additional turbine, in the exhaust of the main engine. In 1942, No 2 Augmentor, a conventional two-stage system with the fan blades external to the turbine blades, was used by GE in the Convair 990 Coronado. A No 3 Augmentor, known as the \"tip turbine\", had the turbine blades outside the fan. A No 4 Augmentor, in combination with the W2/700, included an afterburner and was the design powerplant for the Miles M.52 project. According to Whittle, \"The first attempt at the turbofan proper, ie having the fan ahead of and supercharging the core engine, was the LR1 intended as the power plant of a four-engined bomber for operations in the Pacific. The mass flow through the fan of the LR1 was to have been 3\u20134 times that through the core engine, ie the 'bypass ratio' was 2\u20133.\" Filed in March 1936, Whittle's main turbofan patent 471368, expired in 1962.\nWhittle's work had caused a minor revolution within the British engine manufacturing industry and, even before the E.28/39 flew, most companies had set up their own research efforts. In 1939, Metropolitan-Vickers set up a project to develop an axial-flow design as a turboprop but later re-engineered the design as a pure jet known as the Metrovick F.2. Rolls-Royce had already copied the W.1 to produce the low-rated WR.1 but later stopped work on this project after taking over Rover's efforts. In 1941, de Havilland started a jet fighter project, the Spider Crab\u00a0\u2013 later called Vampire\u00a0\u2013 along with their own engine to power it, Frank Halford's Goblin (Halford H.1). Armstrong Siddeley also developed a more complex axial-flow design with an engineer called Heppner, the ASX but reversed Vickers' thinking and later modified it into a turboprop instead, the Python. The Bristol Aeroplane Company proposed to combine jet and piston engines but dropped the idea and concentrated on propeller turbines instead.\nNationalisation.\nDuring a demonstration of the E.28/39 to Winston Churchill in April 1943, Whittle proposed to Stafford Cripps, Minister of Aircraft Production, that all jet development be nationalised. He pointed out that the company had been funded by private investors who helped develop the engine successfully, only to see production contracts go to other companies. Nationalisation was the only way to repay those debts and ensure a fair deal for everyone, and he was willing to surrender his shares in Power Jets to make this happen. In October, Cripps told Whittle that he decided a better solution would be to nationalise Power Jets only.\nWhittle believed that he had triggered this decision, but Cripps had already been considering how best to maintain a successful jet programme and act responsibly regarding the state's substantial financial investment, while at the same time wanting to establish a research centre that could use Power Jets' talents, and had come to the conclusion that national interests demanded the setting up of a Government-owned establishment. Within the MAP there was a feeling that Power Jets was effectively a research unit funded by the Treasury and that management within the company was non-existent, the latter was also expressed by workers at Power Jets. On 1 December Cripps advised Power Jets' directors that the Treasury would not pay more than \u00a3100,000 for the company.\nIn January 1944 Whittle was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the New Year Honours. By this time he was a group captain, having been promoted from wing commander in July 1943. Later that month after further negotiations the Ministry made another offer of \u00a3135,500 for Power Jets, which was reluctantly accepted after the Ministry refused arbitration on the matter. Since Whittle had already offered to surrender his shares he would receive nothing at all, while Williams and Tinling each received almost \u00a346,800 for their stock, and investors of cash or services had a threefold return on their original investment. Whittle met with Cripps to object personally to the nationalisation efforts and how they were being handled, but to no avail. The final terms were agreed on 28 March, and Power Jets officially became Power Jets (Research and Development) Ltd, with Roxbee Cox as chairman, Constant of RAE Head of Engineering Division, and Whittle as Chief Technical Advisor. On 5 April 1944, the Ministry sent Whittle an award of only \u00a310,000 for his shares.\nWhittle and other Power Jets staff still held the view that they would be the sole designers of jet engines; they would build prototypes and industry would actually produce them. This view was in conflict with that of the engine companies, which in engine design had already achieved competence similar or superior to that of Power Jets. The engine companies stated they would not work with Power Jets if Power Jets were the sole designers. The government scientists from RAE who had been moved to Power Jets were against it also and within MAP there was a feeling that Power Jets was publicly financed but not under public administration. From the end of March, Whittle spent six months in hospital recovering from nervous exhaustion; he resigned from Power Jets (R and D) Ltd in January 1946. In July the company was merged with the gas turbine division of the RAE to form the National Gas Turbine Establishment (NGTE) at Farnborough. Sixteen Power Jets engineers, following Whittle's example, also resigned. The Rolls-Royce Nene (designed by Hooker, Lombard, Pearson and Morley) would be licensed and made in two different countries: in the United States as the Pratt &amp; Whitney J42 jet engine, later incorporated into the Grumman F9F Panther and in the USSR Soviet as the Klimov VK-1 jet engine, later incorporated into the MiG-15; the Panther vs the MiG-15 would meet in air battles during the Korean war.\nAfter the war.\nIn 1946, Whittle accepted a post as Technical Advisor on Engine Design and Production to Controller of Supplies (Air); was made a Commander of the US Legion of Merit; and was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1947. During May 1948 Whittle received an ex-gratia award of \u00a3100,000 from the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors in recognition of his work on the jet engine, and two months later he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire.\nDuring a lecture tour in the US, Whittle again broke down and retired from the RAF on medical grounds on 26 August 1948, leaving with the rank of air commodore. He joined BOAC as a technical advisor on aircraft gas turbines and travelled extensively over the next few years, viewing jet engine developments in the United States, Canada, Africa, Asia and the Middle East. He left BOAC in 1952 and spent the next year working on a biography, \"Jet: The Story of a Pioneer\". He was awarded the Royal Society of Arts' Albert Medal that year.\nReturning to work in 1953, he accepted a position as a Mechanical Engineering Specialist with Shell, where he developed a new type of self-powered drill driven by a turbine running on the lubricating mud that is pumped into the borehole during drilling. Normally, a well is drilled by attaching rigid sections of pipe together and powering the cutting head by spinning the pipe from the surface, but Whittle's design removed the need for a strong mechanical connection between the drill and the head frame, allowing for much lighter piping to be used. He gave the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures in 1954 on \"The Story of Petroleum\".\nTurbine drilling is best used for drilling hard rocks at high-bit RPM with diamond-impregnated bits and can be used with an angled drive shaft for directional drilling and horizontal drilling. It competes, though, with Moyno motors and increasingly with rotary steerable systems and is again out of favour.\nWhittle left Shell in 1957 to work for Bristol Aero Engines, who picked up the project in 1961, setting up \"Bristol Siddeley Whittle Tools\" to further develop the concept. In 1966 Rolls-Royce purchased Bristol Siddeley, but the financial pressures and eventual bankruptcy because of cost overruns of the RB211 project led to the slow wind-down and eventual disappearance of Whittle's \"turbo-drill\". The concept eventually re-appeared in the West in the late 1980s, imported from Russian designs. (Russia needed the technology because it lacked high strength drill pipe.)\nAs part of his socialist ideals, he proposed that Power Jets be nationalised, in part because he saw that private companies would profit from the technology freely given during the war. By 1964, he had deserted his previously socialist beliefs, going so far as to launch a fierce attack on the Labour candidate in Smethwick.\nIn 1960, he was awarded an honorary degree, doctor techn. honoris causa, at the Norwegian Institute of Technology, later part of Norwegian University of Science and Technology.\nIn 1967, he was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Science) by the University of Bath. That year, he was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame.\nIn 1987, he was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Technology) by Loughborough University.\nIn 2017, he was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, Ohio.\nLater life.\nWhittle received the \"Tony Jannus Award\" in 1969 for his distinguished contributions to commercial aviation.\nIn 1976, his marriage to Dorothy was dissolved and he married American Hazel S. Hall. He emigrated to the US and the following year accepted the position of NAVAIR Research Professor at the United States Naval Academy (Annapolis, Maryland). His research concentrated on the boundary layer before his professorship became part-time from 1978 to 1979. The part-time post enabled him to write a textbook entitled \"Gas turbine aero-thermodynamics: with special reference to aircraft propulsion\", published in 1981.\nHaving first met Hans von Ohain in 1966, Whittle again met him at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in 1978 while von Ohain was working there as the Aero Propulsion Laboratory's Chief Scientist. Initially upset because he had believed von Ohain's engine had been developed after seeing Whittle's patent, he eventually became convinced that von Ohain's work was, in fact, independent. The two became good friends and often toured the US giving talks together.\nIn a conversation with Whittle after the war, von Ohain stated: \"If you had been given the money you would have been six years ahead of us. If Hitler or Goering had heard that there is a man in England who flies 500\u00a0mph in a small experimental plane and that it is coming into development, it is likely that World War II would not have come into being.\"\nIn 1986, Whittle was appointed a member of the Order of Merit (Commonwealth). He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society, and of the Royal Aeronautical Society, and in 1991 he and von Ohain were awarded the Charles Stark Draper Prize for their work on turbojet engines.\nWhittle became an atheist by degrees.\nWhittle died of lung cancer on 9 August 1996, at his home in Columbia, Maryland. He was cremated in America and his ashes were flown to England where they were placed in a memorial in a church in Cranwell. Hazel Whittle died on 30 July 2007 aged 91.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is named in the Suda as one of three canonical bucolic poets alongside Theocritus and Moschus. One long poem about Adonis and seventeen shorter fragments of his poetry survive.\nLife.\nAccording to the Suda Bion was from Phlossa, which is not otherwise known but may have been one of the villages which made up Smyrna. Ancient sources do not record Bion's dates or any details about his life, but he likely was active in the late second or early first century BC. An epitaph to Bion says that he was poisoned and implies that he died young.\nPoetry.\nThe Suda and the scholiast on the Palatine Anthology name Bion alongside Theocritus and Moschus as a bucolic poet; he also wrote erotic poetry. His surviving work comprises the \"Lament to Adonis\" and seventeen shorter fragments. All his surviving poetry is composed in dactylic hexameter and in a Doric dialect, which is typical of ancient bucolic poetry. The \"Lament to Adonis\" is 98 lines long; the other fragments are shorter, ranging from a single line to eighteen lines long, and totalling around another 100 lines. One of these fragments, about a bird hunter's attempt to hunt Eros, is probably a complete poem. The remaining fragments seem to come from at least four further poems; no two fragments are certainly from the same poem. The \"Lament for Adonis\" is influenced traditional Greek lament and specifically references Theocritus' \"Lament for Daphnis\".\nBion's work continued to be read until the sixth century AD, and was alluded to by ancient poets including Meleager of Gadara, Ovid, Catullus, and Nonnus. The Greek novelists Achilles Tatius, Longus, and Heliodorus also reference Bion. Pseudo-Moschus' \"Epitaph for Bion\" references Bion's works, particularly the \"Lament for Adonis\".\nBion's longest poem, the \"Lament to Adonis\", is preserved on two medieval manuscripts. It was transmitted anonymously, with one source attributing it to Theocritus. It was first attributed to Bion by Joachim Camerarius in 1530, and has generally been attributed to Bion since, based on the \"Epitaph for Bion\"'s apparent references and metrical similarities with Bion's fragments. The first sixteen fragments were preserved by Johannes Stobaeus; the seventeenth fragment was preserved by Orion of Thebes.\nAnother poem, an epithalamium for Achilles and Deidameia, is also transmitted anonymously in the manuscript tradition but has been attributed to Bion; however there is no strong evidence for this attribution.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

When a pendulum is displaced sideways from its resting, equilibrium position, it is subject to a restoring force due to gravity that will accelerate it back toward the equilibrium position. When released, the restoring force acting on the pendulum's mass causes it to oscillate about the equilibrium position, swinging back and forth. The time for one complete cycle, a left swing and a right swing, is called the period. The period depends on the length of the pendulum and also to a slight degree on the amplitude, the width of the pendulum's swing. Pendulums were widely used in early mechanical clocks for timekeeping. The SI unit of the period of a pendulum is the second (s).\nThe regular motion of pendulums was used for timekeeping and was the world's most accurate timekeeping technology until the 1930s. The pendulum clock invented by Christiaan Huygens in 1656 became the world's standard timekeeper, used in homes and offices for 270 years, and achieved accuracy of about one second per year before it was superseded as a time standard by the quartz clock in the 1930s. Pendulums are also used in scientific instruments such as accelerometers and seismometers. Historically they were used as gravimeters to measure the acceleration of gravity in geo-physical surveys, and even as a standard of length. The word \"pendulum\" is Neo-Latin, from the Latin , meaning 'hanging'.\nMechanics.\nSimple gravity pendulum.\nThe \"simple gravity pendulum\" is an idealized mathematical model of a pendulum. This is a weight (or bob) on the end of a massless cord suspended from a pivot, without friction. When given an initial push, it will swing back and forth at a constant amplitude. Real pendulums are subject to friction and air drag, so the amplitude of their swings declines.\nPeriod of oscillation.\nThe period of swing of a simple gravity pendulum depends on its length, the local strength of gravity, and to a small extent on the maximum angle that the pendulum swings away from vertical, \"\u03b8\"0, called the amplitude. It is independent of the mass of the bob. If the amplitude is limited to small swings, the period T of a simple pendulum, the time taken for a complete cycle, is:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nwhere formula_1 is the length of the pendulum and formula_2 is the local acceleration of gravity.\nFor small swings the period of swing is approximately the same for different size swings: that is, \"the period is independent of amplitude\". This property, called isochronism, is the reason pendulums are so useful for timekeeping. Successive swings of the pendulum, even if changing in amplitude, take the same amount of time.\nFor larger amplitudes, the period increases gradually with amplitude so it is longer than given by equation (1). For example, at an amplitude of \"\u03b8\"0 = 0.4 radians (23\u00b0) it is 1% larger than given by (1). The period increases asymptotically (to infinity) as \"\u03b8\"0 approaches \u03c0 radians (180\u00b0), because the value \"\u03b8\"0 = \u03c0 is an unstable equilibrium point for the pendulum. The true period of an ideal simple gravity pendulum can be written in several different forms (see pendulum (mechanics)), one example being the infinite series:\nformula_3\nwhere formula_4 is in radians.\nThe difference between this true period and the period for small swings (1) above is called the \"circular error\". In the case of a typical grandfather clock whose pendulum has a swing of 6\u00b0 and thus an amplitude of 3\u00b0 (0.05\u00a0radians), the difference between the true period and the small angle approximation (1) amounts to about 15 seconds per day.\nFor small swings the pendulum approximates a harmonic oscillator, and its motion as a function of time, \"t\", is approximately simple harmonic motion:\nformula_5\nwhere formula_6 is a constant value, dependent on initial conditions.\nFor real pendulums, the period varies slightly with factors such as the buoyancy and viscous resistance of the air, the mass of the string or rod, the size and shape of the bob and how it is attached to the string, and flexibility and stretching of the string. In precision applications, corrections for these factors may need to be applied to eq. (1) to give the period accurately.\nA damped, driven pendulum is a chaotic system.\nCompound pendulum.\nAny swinging rigid body free to rotate about a fixed horizontal axis is called a compound pendulum or physical pendulum. A compound pendulum has the same period as a simple gravity pendulum of length formula_7, called the \"equivalent length\" or \"radius of oscillation\", equal to the distance from the pivot to a point called the \"center of oscillation\". This point is located under the center of mass of the pendulum, at a distance which depends on the mass distribution of the pendulum. If most of the mass is concentrated in a relatively small bob compared to the pendulum length, the center of oscillation is close to the center of mass.\nThe radius of oscillation or equivalent length formula_7 of any physical pendulum can be shown to be\nformula_9 \nwhere formula_10 is the moment of inertia of the pendulum about the pivot point formula_11, formula_12 is the total mass of the pendulum, and formula_13 is the distance between the pivot point and the center of mass.\nSubstituting this expression in (1) above, the period formula_14 of a compound pendulum is given by\nformula_15\nfor sufficiently small oscillations.\nFor example, a rigid uniform rod of length formula_16 pivoted about one end has moment of inertia formula_17. The center of mass is located at the center of the rod, so formula_18 Substituting these values into the above equation gives formula_19. This shows that a rigid rod pendulum has the same period as a simple pendulum of two-thirds its length.\nChristiaan Huygens proved in 1673 that the pivot point and the center of oscillation are interchangeable. This means if any pendulum is turned upside down and swung from a pivot located at its previous center of oscillation, it will have the same period as before and the new center of oscillation will be at the old pivot point. In 1817 Henry Kater used this idea to produce a type of reversible pendulum, now known as a Kater pendulum, for improved measurements of the acceleration due to gravity.\nDouble pendulum.\nIn physics and mathematics, in the area of dynamical systems, a double pendulum, also known as a chaotic pendulum, is a pendulum with another pendulum attached to its end, forming a simple physical system that exhibits rich dynamic behavior with a strong sensitivity to initial conditions. The motion of a double pendulum is governed by a set of coupled ordinary differential equations and is chaotic.\nHistory.\nOne of the earliest known uses of a pendulum was a 1st-century seismometer device of Han dynasty Chinese scientist Zhang Heng. Its function was to sway and activate one of a series of levers after being disturbed by the tremor of an earthquake far away. Released by a lever, a small ball would fall out of the urn-shaped device into one of eight metal toads' mouths below, at the eight points of the compass, signifying the direction the earthquake was located.\nMany sources claim that the 10th-century Egyptian astronomer Ibn Yunus used a pendulum for time measurement, but this was an error that originated in 1684 with the British historian Edward Bernard.\nDuring the Renaissance, large hand-pumped pendulums were used as sources of power for manual reciprocating machines such as saws, bellows, and pumps.\n1602: Galileo's research.\nItalian scientist Galileo Galilei was the first to study the properties of pendulums, beginning around 1602. The first recorded interest in pendulums made by Galileo was around 1588 in his posthumously published notes titled \"On Motion\", in which he noted that heavier objects would continue to oscillate for a greater amount of time than lighter objects. The earliest extant report of his experimental research is contained in a letter to Guido Ubaldo dal Monte, from Padua, dated November 29, 1602. His biographer and student, Vincenzo Viviani, claimed his interest had been sparked around 1582 by the swinging motion of a chandelier in Pisa Cathedral. Galileo discovered the crucial property that makes pendulums useful as timekeepers, called isochronism; the period of the pendulum is approximately independent of the amplitude or width of the swing. He also found that the period is independent of the mass of the bob, and proportional to the square root of the length of the pendulum. He first employed freeswinging pendulums in simple timing applications. Santorio Santori in 1602 invented a device which measured a patient's pulse by the length of a pendulum; the \"pulsilogium\". In 1641 Galileo dictated to his son Vincenzo a design for a mechanism to keep a pendulum swinging, which has been described as the first pendulum clock; Vincenzo began construction, but had not completed it when he died in 1649.\n1656: The pendulum clock.\nIn 1656 the Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens built the first pendulum clock. This was a great improvement over existing mechanical clocks; their best accuracy was improved from around 15 minutes deviation a day to around 15 seconds a day. Pendulums spread over Europe as existing clocks were retrofitted with them.\nThe English scientist Robert Hooke studied the conical pendulum around 1666, consisting of a pendulum that is free to swing in two dimensions, with the bob rotating in a circle or ellipse. He used the motions of this device as a model to analyze the orbital motions of the planets. Hooke suggested to Isaac Newton in 1679 that the components of orbital motion consisted of inertial motion along a tangent direction plus an attractive motion in the radial direction. This played a part in Newton's formulation of the law of universal gravitation. Robert Hooke was also responsible for suggesting as early as 1666 that the pendulum could be used to measure the force of gravity.\nDuring his expedition to Cayenne, French Guiana in 1671, Jean Richer found that a pendulum clock was &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2+1\u20442 minutes per day slower at Cayenne than at Paris. From this he deduced that the force of gravity was lower at Cayenne. In 1687, Isaac Newton in \"Principia Mathematica\" showed that this was because the Earth was not a true sphere but slightly oblate (flattened at the poles) from the effect of centrifugal force due to its rotation, causing gravity to increase with latitude. Portable pendulums began to be taken on voyages to distant lands, as precision gravimeters to measure the acceleration of gravity at different points on Earth, eventually resulting in accurate models of the shape of the Earth.\n1673: Huygens' \"Horologium Oscillatorium\".\nIn 1673, 17 years after he invented the pendulum clock, Christiaan Huygens published his theory of the pendulum, \"Horologium Oscillatorium sive de motu pendulorum\". Marin Mersenne and Ren\u00e9 Descartes had discovered around 1636 that the pendulum was not quite isochronous; its period increased somewhat with its amplitude. Huygens analyzed this problem by determining what curve an object must follow to descend by gravity to the same point in the same time interval, regardless of starting point; the so-called \"tautochrone curve\". By a complicated method that was an early use of calculus, he showed this curve was a cycloid, rather than the circular arc of a pendulum, confirming that the pendulum was not isochronous and Galileo's observation of isochronism was accurate only for small swings. Huygens also solved the problem of how to calculate the period of an arbitrarily shaped pendulum (called a \"compound pendulum\"), discovering the \"center of oscillation\", and its interchangeability with the pivot point.\nThe existing clock movement, the verge escapement, made pendulums swing in very wide arcs of about 100\u00b0. Huygens showed this was a source of inaccuracy, causing the period to vary with amplitude changes caused by small unavoidable variations in the clock's drive force. To make its period isochronous, Huygens mounted cycloidal-shaped metal guides next to the pivots in his clocks, that constrained the suspension cord and forced the pendulum to follow a cycloid arc (see cycloidal pendulum). This solution didn't prove as practical as simply limiting the pendulum's swing to small angles of a few degrees. The realization that only small swings were isochronous motivated the development of the anchor escapement around 1670, which reduced the pendulum swing in clocks to 4\u00b0\u20136\u00b0. This became the standard escapement used in pendulum clocks.\n1721: Temperature compensated pendulums.\nDuring the 18th and 19th century, the pendulum clock's role as the most accurate timekeeper motivated much practical research into improving pendulums. It was found that a major source of error was that the pendulum rod expanded and contracted with changes in ambient temperature, changing the period of swing. This was solved with the invention of temperature compensated pendulums, the mercury pendulum in 1721 and the gridiron pendulum in 1726, reducing errors in precision pendulum clocks to a few seconds per week.\nThe accuracy of gravity measurements made with pendulums was limited by the difficulty of finding the location of their center of oscillation. Huygens had discovered in 1673 that a pendulum has the same period when hung from its center of oscillation as when hung from its pivot, and the distance between the two points was equal to the length of a simple gravity pendulum of the same period. In 1818 British Captain Henry Kater invented the reversible Kater's pendulum which used this principle, making possible very accurate measurements of gravity. For the next century the reversible pendulum was the standard method of measuring absolute gravitational acceleration.\n1851: Foucault pendulum.\nIn 1851, Jean Bernard L\u00e9on Foucault showed that the plane of oscillation of a pendulum, like a gyroscope, tends to stay constant regardless of the motion of the pivot, and that this could be used to demonstrate the rotation of the Earth. He suspended a pendulum free to swing in two dimensions (later named the Foucault pendulum) from the dome of the Panth\u00e9on in Paris. The length of the cord was . Once the pendulum was set in motion, the plane of swing was observed to precess or rotate 360\u00b0 clockwise in about 32 hours.\nThis was the first demonstration of the Earth's rotation that did not depend on celestial observations, and a \"pendulum mania\" broke out, as Foucault pendulums were displayed in many cities and attracted large crowds.\n1930: Decline in use.\nAround 1900 low-thermal-expansion materials began to be used for pendulum rods in the highest precision clocks and other instruments, first invar, a nickel steel alloy, and later fused quartz, which made temperature compensation trivial. Precision pendulums were housed in low pressure tanks, which kept the air pressure constant to prevent changes in the period due to changes in buoyancy of the pendulum due to changing atmospheric pressure. The best pendulum clocks achieved accuracy of around a second per year.\nThe timekeeping accuracy of the pendulum was exceeded by the quartz crystal oscillator, invented in 1921, and quartz clocks, invented in 1927, replaced pendulum clocks as the world's best timekeepers. Pendulum clocks were used as time standards until World War 2, although the French Time Service continued using them in their official time standard ensemble until 1954. Pendulum gravimeters were superseded by \"free fall\" gravimeters in the 1950s, but pendulum instruments continued to be used into the 1970s.\nUse for time measurement.\nFor 300 years, from its discovery around 1582 until development of the quartz clock in the 1930s, the pendulum was the world's standard for accurate timekeeping. In addition to clock pendulums, freeswinging seconds pendulums were widely used as precision timers in scientific experiments in the 17th and 18th centuries. Pendulums require great mechanical stability: a length change of only 0.02%, 0.2\u00a0mm in a grandfather clock pendulum, will cause an error of a minute per week.\nClock pendulums.\nPendulums in clocks (see example at right) are usually made of a weight or bob \"(b)\" suspended by a rod of wood or metal \"(a)\". To reduce air resistance (which accounts for most of the energy loss in precision clocks) the bob is traditionally a smooth disk with a lens-shaped cross section, although in antique clocks it often had carvings or decorations specific to the type of clock. In quality clocks the bob is made as heavy as the suspension can support and the movement can drive, since this improves the regulation of the clock (see Accuracy below). A common weight for seconds pendulum bobs is . Instead of hanging from a pivot, clock pendulums are usually supported by a short straight spring \"(d)\" of flexible metal ribbon. This avoids the friction and 'play' caused by a pivot, and the slight bending force of the spring merely adds to the pendulum's restoring force. The highest precision clocks have pivots of 'knife' blades resting on agate plates. The impulses to keep the pendulum swinging are provided by an arm hanging behind the pendulum called the \"crutch\", \"(e)\", which ends in a \"fork\", \"(f)\" whose prongs embrace the pendulum rod. The crutch is pushed back and forth by the clock's escapement, \"(g,h)\".\nEach time the pendulum swings through its centre position, it releases one tooth of the \"escape wheel\" \"(g)\". The force of the clock's mainspring or a driving weight hanging from a pulley, transmitted through the clock's gear train, causes the wheel to turn, and a tooth presses against one of the pallets \"(h)\", giving the pendulum a short push. The clock's wheels, geared to the escape wheel, move forward a fixed amount with each pendulum swing, advancing the clock's hands at a steady rate.\nThe pendulum always has a means of adjusting the period, usually by an adjustment nut \"(c)\" under the bob which moves it up or down on the rod. Moving the bob up decreases the pendulum's length, causing the pendulum to swing faster and the clock to gain time. Some precision clocks have a small auxiliary adjustment weight on a threaded shaft on the bob, to allow finer adjustment. Some tower clocks and precision clocks use a tray attached near to the midpoint of the pendulum rod, to which small weights can be added or removed. This effectively shifts the centre of oscillation and allows the rate to be adjusted without stopping the clock.\nThe pendulum must be suspended from a rigid support. During operation, any elasticity will allow tiny imperceptible swaying motions of the support, which disturbs the clock's period, resulting in error. Pendulum clocks should be attached firmly to a sturdy wall.\nThe most common pendulum length in quality clocks, which is always used in grandfather clocks, is the seconds pendulum, about long. In mantel clocks, half-second pendulums, long, or shorter, are used. Only a few large tower clocks use longer pendulums, the 1.5 second pendulum, long, or occasionally the two-second pendulum, which is used in Big Ben.\nTemperature compensation.\nThe largest source of error in early pendulums was slight changes in length due to thermal expansion and contraction of the pendulum rod with changes in ambient temperature. This was discovered when people noticed that pendulum clocks ran slower in summer, by as much as a minute per week (one of the first was Godefroy Wendelin, as reported by Huygens in 1658). Thermal expansion of pendulum rods was first studied by Jean Picard in 1669. A pendulum with a steel rod will expand by about 11.3 parts per million (ppm) with each degree Celsius increase, causing it to lose about 0.27 seconds per day for every degree Celsius increase in temperature, or 9 seconds per day for a change. Wood rods expand less, losing only about 6 seconds per day for a change, which is why quality clocks often had wooden pendulum rods. The wood had to be varnished to prevent water vapor from getting in, because changes in humidity also affected the length.\nMercury pendulum.\nThe first device to compensate for this error was the mercury pendulum, invented by George Graham in 1721. The liquid metal mercury expands in volume with temperature. In a mercury pendulum, the pendulum's weight (bob) is a container of mercury. With a temperature rise, the pendulum rod gets longer, but the mercury also expands and its surface level rises slightly in the container, moving its centre of mass closer to the pendulum pivot. By using the correct height of mercury in the container these two effects will cancel, leaving the pendulum's centre of mass, and its period, unchanged with temperature. Its main disadvantage was that when the temperature changed, the rod would come to the new temperature quickly but the mass of mercury might take a day or two to reach the new temperature, causing the rate to deviate during that time. To improve thermal accommodation several thin containers were often used, made of metal. Mercury pendulums were the standard used in precision regulator clocks into the 20th century.\nGridiron pendulum.\nThe most widely used compensated pendulum was the gridiron pendulum, invented in 1726 by John Harrison. This consists of alternating rods of two different metals, one with lower thermal expansion (CTE), steel, and one with higher thermal expansion, zinc or brass. The rods are connected by a frame, as shown in the drawing at the right, so that an increase in length of the zinc rods pushes the bob up, shortening the pendulum. With a temperature increase, the low expansion steel rods make the pendulum longer, while the high expansion zinc rods make it shorter. By making the rods of the correct lengths, the greater expansion of the zinc cancels out the expansion of the steel rods which have a greater combined length, and the pendulum stays the same length with temperature.\nZinc-steel gridiron pendulums are made with 5 rods, but the thermal expansion of brass is closer to steel, so brass-steel gridirons usually require 9 rods. Gridiron pendulums adjust to temperature changes faster than mercury pendulums, but scientists found that friction of the rods sliding in their holes in the frame caused gridiron pendulums to adjust in a series of tiny jumps. In high precision clocks this caused the clock's rate to change suddenly with each jump. Later it was found that zinc is subject to creep. For these reasons mercury pendulums were used in the highest precision clocks, but gridirons were used in quality regulator clocks.\nGridiron pendulums became so associated with good quality that, to this day, many ordinary clock pendulums have decorative 'fake' gridirons that don't actually have any temperature compensation function.\nInvar and fused quartz.\nAround 1900, low thermal expansion materials were developed which could be used as pendulum rods in order to make elaborate temperature compensation unnecessary. These were only used in a few of the highest precision clocks before the pendulum became obsolete as a time standard. In 1896 Charles \u00c9douard Guillaume invented the nickel steel alloy Invar. This has a CTE of around (), resulting in pendulum temperature errors over of only 1.3\u00a0seconds per day, and this residual error could be compensated to zero with a few centimeters of aluminium under the pendulum bob (this can be seen in the Riefler clock image above). Invar pendulums were first used in 1898 in the Riefler regulator clock which achieved accuracy of 15\u00a0milliseconds per day. Suspension springs of Elinvar were used to eliminate temperature variation of the spring's restoring force on the pendulum. Later fused quartz was used which had even lower CTE. These materials are the choice for modern high accuracy pendulums.\nAtmospheric pressure.\nThe effect of the surrounding air on a moving pendulum is complex and requires fluid mechanics to calculate precisely, but for most purposes its influence on the period can be accounted for by three effects:\nIncreases in barometric pressure increase a pendulum's period slightly due to the first two effects, by about . Researchers using pendulums to measure the acceleration of gravity had to correct the period for the air pressure at the altitude of measurement, computing the equivalent period of a pendulum swinging in vacuum. A pendulum clock was first operated in a constant-pressure tank by Friedrich Tiede in 1865 at the Berlin Observatory, and by 1900 the highest precision clocks were mounted in tanks that were kept at a constant pressure to eliminate changes in atmospheric pressure. Alternatively, in some a small aneroid barometer mechanism attached to the pendulum compensated for this effect.\nGravity.\nPendulums are affected by changes in gravitational acceleration, which varies by as much as 0.5% at different locations on Earth, so precision pendulum clocks have to be recalibrated after a move. Even moving a pendulum clock to the top of a tall building can cause it to lose measurable time from the reduction in gravity.\nAccuracy of pendulums as timekeepers.\nThe timekeeping elements in all clocks, which include pendulums, balance wheels, the quartz crystals used in quartz watches, and even the vibrating atoms in atomic clocks, are in physics called harmonic oscillators. The reason harmonic oscillators are used in clocks is that they vibrate or oscillate at a specific resonant frequency or period and resist oscillating at other rates. However, the resonant frequency is not infinitely 'sharp'. Around the resonant frequency there is a narrow natural band of frequencies (or periods), called the resonance width or bandwidth, where the harmonic oscillator will oscillate. In a clock, the actual frequency of the pendulum may vary randomly within this resonance width in response to disturbances, but at frequencies outside this band, the clock will not function at all. The resonance width is determined by the damping, the frictional energy loss per swing of the pendulum.\n\"Q\" factor.\nThe measure of a harmonic oscillator's resistance to disturbances to its oscillation period is a dimensionless parameter called the \"Q\" factor equal to the resonant frequency divided by the resonance width. The higher the \"Q\", the smaller the resonance width, and the more constant the frequency or period of the oscillator for a given disturbance. The reciprocal of the Q is roughly proportional to the limiting accuracy achievable by a harmonic oscillator as a time standard.\nThe \"Q\" is related to how long it takes for the oscillations of an oscillator to die out. The \"Q\" of a pendulum can be measured by counting the number of oscillations it takes for the amplitude of the pendulum's swing to decay to 1/\"e\" = 36.8% of its initial swing, and multiplying by \"\u03c0\".\nIn a clock, the pendulum must receive pushes from the clock's movement to keep it swinging, to replace the energy the pendulum loses to friction. These pushes, applied by a mechanism called the escapement, are the main source of disturbance to the pendulum's motion. The \"Q\" is equal to 2\"\u03c0\" times the energy stored in the pendulum, divided by the energy lost to friction during each oscillation period, which is the same as the energy added by the escapement each period. It can be seen that the smaller the fraction of the pendulum's energy that is lost to friction, the less energy needs to be added, the less the disturbance from the escapement, the more 'independent' the pendulum is of the clock's mechanism, and the more constant its period is. The \"Q\" of a pendulum is given by:\nformula_20\nwhere \"M\" is the mass of the bob, \"\u03c9\" = 2\"\u03c0\"/\"T\" is the pendulum's radian frequency of oscillation, and \u0393 is the frictional damping force on the pendulum per unit velocity.\n\"\u03c9\" is fixed by the pendulum's period, and \"M\" is limited by the load capacity and rigidity of the suspension. So the \"Q\" of clock pendulums is increased by minimizing frictional losses (\u0393). Precision pendulums are suspended on low friction pivots consisting of triangular shaped 'knife' edges resting on agate plates. Around 99% of the energy loss in a freeswinging pendulum is due to air friction, so mounting a pendulum in a vacuum tank can increase the \"Q\", and thus the accuracy, by a factor of 100.\nThe \"Q\" of pendulums ranges from several thousand in an ordinary clock to several hundred thousand for precision regulator pendulums swinging in vacuum. A quality home pendulum clock might have a \"Q\" of 10,000 and an accuracy of 10 seconds per month. The most accurate commercially produced pendulum clock was the Shortt-Synchronome free pendulum clock, invented in 1921. Its Invar master pendulum swinging in a vacuum tank had a \"Q\" of 110,000 and an error rate of around a second per year.\nTheir Q of 103\u2013105 is one reason why pendulums are more accurate timekeepers than the balance wheels in watches, with \"Q\" around 100\u2013300, but less accurate than the quartz crystals in quartz clocks, with \"Q\" of 105\u2013106.\nEscapement.\nPendulums (unlike, for example, quartz crystals) have a low enough \"Q\" that the disturbance caused by the impulses to keep them moving is generally the limiting factor on their timekeeping accuracy. Therefore, the design of the escapement, the mechanism that provides these impulses, has a large effect on the accuracy of a clock pendulum. If the impulses given to the pendulum by the escapement each swing could be exactly identical, the response of the pendulum would be identical, and its period would be constant. However, this is not achievable; unavoidable random fluctuations in the force due to friction of the clock's pallets, lubrication variations, and changes in the torque provided by the clock's power source as it runs down, mean that the force of the impulse applied by the escapement varies.\nIf these variations in the escapement's force cause changes in the pendulum's width of swing (amplitude), this will cause corresponding slight changes in the period, since (as discussed at top) a pendulum with a finite swing is not quite isochronous. Therefore, the goal of traditional escapement design is to apply the force with the proper profile, and at the correct point in the pendulum's cycle, so force variations have no effect on the pendulum's amplitude. This is called an \"isochronous escapement\".\nThe Airy condition.\nClockmakers had known for centuries that the disturbing effect of the escapement's drive force on the period of a pendulum is smallest if given as a short impulse as the pendulum passes through its bottom equilibrium position. If the impulse occurs before the pendulum reaches bottom, during the downward swing, it will have the effect of shortening the pendulum's natural period, so an increase in drive force will decrease the period. If the impulse occurs after the pendulum reaches bottom, during the upswing, it will lengthen the period, so an increase in drive force will increase the pendulum's period. In 1826 British astronomer George Airy proved this; specifically, he proved that if a pendulum is driven by an impulse that is symmetrical about its bottom equilibrium position, the pendulum's period will be unaffected by changes in the drive force. The most accurate escapements, such as the deadbeat, approximately satisfy this condition.\nGravity measurement.\nThe presence of the acceleration of gravity \"g\" in the periodicity equation (1) for a pendulum means that the local gravitational acceleration of the Earth can be calculated from the period of a pendulum. A pendulum can therefore be used as a gravimeter to measure the local gravity, which varies by over 0.5% across the surface of the Earth. The pendulum in a clock is disturbed by the pushes it receives from the clock movement, so freeswinging pendulums were used, and were the standard instruments of gravimetry up to the 1930s.\nThe difference between clock pendulums and gravimeter pendulums is that to measure gravity, the pendulum's length as well as its period has to be measured. The period of freeswinging pendulums could be found to great precision by comparing their swing with a precision clock that had been adjusted to keep correct time by the passage of stars overhead. In the early measurements, a weight on a cord was suspended in front of the clock pendulum, and its length adjusted until the two pendulums swung in exact synchronism. Then the length of the cord was measured. From the length and the period, \"g\" could be calculated from equation (1).\nThe seconds pendulum.\nThe seconds pendulum, a pendulum with a period of two seconds so each swing takes one second, was widely used to measure gravity, because its period could be easily measured by comparing it to precision regulator clocks, which all had seconds pendulums. By the late 17th century, the length of the seconds pendulum became the standard measure of the strength of gravitational acceleration at a location. By 1700 its length had been measured with submillimeter accuracy at several cities in Europe. For a seconds pendulum, \"g\" is proportional to its length:\nformula_21\nKater's pendulum.\nThe precision of the early gravity measurements above was limited by the difficulty of measuring the length of the pendulum, \"L\" . \"L\" was the length of an idealized simple gravity pendulum (described at top), which has all its mass concentrated in a point at the end of the cord. In 1673 Huygens had shown that the period of a rigid bar pendulum (called a \"compound pendulum\") was equal to the period of a simple pendulum with a length equal to the distance between the pivot point and a point called the center of oscillation, located under the center of gravity, that depends on the mass distribution along the pendulum. But there was no accurate way of determining the center of oscillation in a real pendulum. Huygens' discovery is sometimes referred to as \"Huygens' law of the (cycloidal) pendulum\".\nTo get around this problem, the early researchers above approximated an ideal simple pendulum as closely as possible by using a metal sphere suspended by a light wire or cord. If the wire was light enough, the center of oscillation was close to the center of gravity of the ball, at its geometric center. This \"ball and wire\" type of pendulum wasn't very accurate, because it didn't swing as a rigid body, and the elasticity of the wire caused its length to change slightly as the pendulum swung.\nHowever Huygens had also proved that in any pendulum, the pivot point and the center of oscillation were interchangeable. That is, if a pendulum were turned upside down and hung from its center of oscillation, it would have the same period as it did in the previous position, and the old pivot point would be the new center of oscillation.\nBritish physicist and army captain Henry Kater in 1817 realized that Huygens' principle could be used to find the length of a simple pendulum with the same period as a real pendulum. If a pendulum was built with a second adjustable pivot point near the bottom so it could be hung upside down, and the second pivot was adjusted until the periods when hung from both pivots were the same, the second pivot would be at the center of oscillation, and the distance between the two pivots would be the length \"L\" of a simple pendulum with the same period.\nKater built a reversible pendulum (\"see drawing\") consisting of a brass bar with two opposing pivots made of short triangular \"knife\" blades \"(a)\" near either end. It could be swung from either pivot, with the knife blades supported on agate plates. Rather than make one pivot adjustable, he attached the pivots a meter apart and instead adjusted the periods with a moveable weight on the pendulum rod \"(b,c)\". In operation, the pendulum is hung in front of a precision clock, and the period timed, then turned upside down and the period timed again. The weight is adjusted with the adjustment screw until the periods are equal. Then putting this period and the distance between the pivots into equation (1) gives the gravitational acceleration \"g\" very accurately.\nKater timed the swing of his pendulum using the \"method of coincidences\" and measured the distance between the two pivots with a micrometer. After applying corrections for the finite amplitude of swing, the buoyancy of the bob, the barometric pressure and altitude, and temperature, he obtained a value of 39.13929\u00a0inches for the seconds pendulum at London, in vacuum, at sea level, at 62\u00a0\u00b0F. The largest variation from the mean of his 12 observations was 0.00028 in. representing a precision of gravity measurement of 7\u00d710\u22126 (7 mGal or 70 \u03bcm/s2). Kater's measurement was used as Britain's official standard of length (see below) from 1824 to 1855.\nReversible pendulums (known technically as \"convertible\" pendulums) employing Kater's principle were used for absolute gravity measurements into the 1930s.\nLater pendulum gravimeters.\nThe increased accuracy made possible by Kater's pendulum helped make gravimetry a standard part of geodesy. Since the exact location (latitude and longitude) of the 'station' where the gravity measurement was made was necessary, gravity measurements became part of surveying, and pendulums were taken on the great geodetic surveys of the 18th century, particularly the Great Trigonometric Survey of India.\nThe Mendenhall pendulum was actually a more accurate timekeeper than the highest precision clocks of the time, and as the 'world's best clock' it was used by Albert A. Michelson in his 1924 measurements of the speed of light on Mt. Wilson, California.\nRelative pendulum gravimeters were superseded by the simpler LaCoste zero-length spring gravimeter, invented in 1934 by Lucien LaCoste. Absolute (reversible) pendulum gravimeters were replaced in the 1950s by free fall gravimeters, in which a weight is allowed to fall in a vacuum tank and its acceleration is measured by an optical interferometer.\nStandard of length.\nBecause the acceleration of gravity is constant at a given point on Earth, the period of a simple pendulum at a given location depends only on its length. Additionally, gravity varies only slightly at different locations. Almost from the pendulum's discovery until the early 19th century, this property led scientists to suggest using a pendulum of a given period as a standard of length.\nUntil the 19th century, countries based their systems of length measurement on prototypes, metal bar primary standards, such as the standard yard in Britain kept at the Houses of Parliament, and the standard \"toise\" in France, kept at Paris. These were vulnerable to damage or destruction over the years, and because of the difficulty of comparing prototypes, the same unit often had different lengths in distant towns, creating opportunities for fraud. During the Enlightenment scientists argued for a length standard that was based on some property of nature that could be determined by measurement, creating an indestructible, universal standard. The period of pendulums could be measured very precisely by timing them with clocks that were set by the stars. A pendulum standard amounted to defining the unit of length by the gravitational force of the Earth, for all intents constant, and the second, which was defined by the rotation rate of the Earth, also constant. The idea was that anyone, anywhere on Earth, could recreate the standard by constructing a pendulum that swung with the defined period and measuring its length.\nVirtually all proposals were based on the seconds pendulum, in which each swing (a half period) takes one second, which is about a meter (39\u00a0inches) long, because by the late 17th century it had become a standard for measuring gravity (see previous section). By the 18th century its length had been measured with sub-millimeter accuracy at a number of cities in Europe and around the world.\nThe initial attraction of the pendulum length standard was that it was believed (by early scientists such as Huygens and Wren) that gravity was constant over the Earth's surface, so a given pendulum had the same period at any point on Earth. So the length of the standard pendulum could be measured at any location, and would not be tied to any given nation or region; it would be a truly democratic, worldwide standard. Although Richer found in 1672 that gravity varies at different points on the globe, the idea of a pendulum length standard remained popular, because it was found that gravity only varies with latitude. Gravitational acceleration increases smoothly from the equator to the poles, due to the oblate shape of the Earth, so at any given latitude (east\u2013west line), gravity was constant enough that the length of a seconds pendulum was the same within the measurement capability of the 18th century. Thus the unit of length could be defined at a given latitude and measured at any point along that latitude. For example, a pendulum standard defined at 45\u00b0 north latitude, a popular choice, could be measured in parts of France, Italy, Croatia, Serbia, Romania, Russia, Kazakhstan, China, Mongolia, the United States and Canada. In addition, it could be recreated at any location at which the gravitational acceleration had been accurately measured.\nBy the mid-19th century, increasingly accurate pendulum measurements by Edward Sabine and Thomas Young revealed that gravity, and thus the length of any pendulum standard, varied measurably with local geologic features such as mountains and dense subsurface rocks. So a pendulum length standard had to be defined at a single point on Earth and could only be measured there. This took much of the appeal from the concept, and efforts to adopt pendulum standards were abandoned.\nEarly proposals.\nOne of the first to suggest defining length with a pendulum was Flemish scientist Isaac Beeckman who in 1631 recommended making the seconds pendulum \"the invariable measure for all people at all times in all places\". Marin Mersenne, who first measured the seconds pendulum in 1644, also suggested it. The first official proposal for a pendulum standard was made by the British Royal Society in 1660, advocated by Christiaan Huygens and Ole R\u00f8mer, basing it on Mersenne's work, and Huygens in \"Horologium Oscillatorium\" proposed a \"horary foot\" defined as 1/3 of the seconds pendulum. Christopher Wren was another early supporter. The idea of a pendulum standard of length must have been familiar to people as early as 1663, because Samuel Butler satirizes it in \"Hudibras\":\nUpon the bench I will so handle \u2018em\nThat the vibration of this pendulum\nShall make all taylors\u2019 yards of one\nUnanimous opinion\nIn 1671 Jean Picard proposed a pendulum-defined 'universal foot' in his influential \"Mesure de la Terre\". Gabriel Mouton around 1670 suggested defining the \"toise\" either by a seconds pendulum or a minute of terrestrial degree. A plan for a complete system of units based on the pendulum was advanced in 1675 by Italian polymath Tito Livio Burratini. In France in 1747, geographer Charles Marie de la Condamine proposed defining length by a seconds pendulum at the equator; since at this location a pendulum's swing wouldn't be distorted by the Earth's rotation. James Steuart (1780) and George Skene Keith were also supporters.\nBy the end of the 18th century, when many nations were reforming their weight and measure systems, the seconds pendulum was the leading choice for a new definition of length, advocated by prominent scientists in several major nations. In 1790, then US Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson proposed to Congress a comprehensive decimalized US 'metric system' based on the seconds pendulum at 38\u00b0 North latitude, the mean latitude of the United States. No action was taken on this proposal. In Britain the leading advocate of the pendulum was politician John Riggs Miller. When his efforts to promote a joint British\u2013French\u2013American metric system fell through in 1790, he proposed a British system based on the length of the seconds pendulum at London. This standard was adopted in 1824 (below).\nThe metre.\nIn the discussions leading up to the French adoption of the metric system in 1791, the leading candidate for the definition of the new unit of length, the metre, was the seconds pendulum at 45\u00b0 North latitude. It was advocated by a group led by French politician Talleyrand and mathematician Antoine Nicolas Caritat de Condorcet. This was one of the three final options considered by the French Academy of Sciences committee. However, on March 19, 1791, the committee instead chose to base the metre on the length of the meridian through Paris. A pendulum definition was rejected because of its variability at different locations, and because it defined length by a unit of time. (However, since 1983 the metre has been officially defined in terms of the length of the second and the speed of light.) A possible additional reason is that the radical French Academy didn't want to base their new system on the second, a traditional and nondecimal unit from the \"ancien regime\".\nAlthough not defined by the pendulum, the final length chosen for the metre, 10\u22127 of the pole-to-equator meridian arc, was very close to the length of the seconds pendulum (0.9937 m), within 0.63%. Although no reason for this particular choice was given at the time, it was probably to facilitate the use of the seconds pendulum as a secondary standard, as was proposed in the official document. So the modern world's standard unit of length is certainly closely linked historically with the seconds pendulum.\nBritain and Denmark.\nBritain and Denmark appear to be the only nations that (for a short time) based their units of length on the pendulum. In 1821 the Danish inch was defined as 1/38 of the length of the mean solar seconds pendulum at 45\u00b0 latitude at the meridian of Skagen, at sea level, in vacuum. The British parliament passed the \"Imperial Weights and Measures Act\" in 1824, a reform of the British standard system which declared that if the prototype standard yard was destroyed, it would be recovered by defining the inch so that the length of the solar seconds pendulum at London, at sea level, in a vacuum, at 62\u00a0\u00b0F was 39.1393\u00a0inches. This also became the US standard, since at the time the US used British measures. However, when the prototype yard was lost in the 1834 Houses of Parliament fire, it proved impossible to recreate it accurately from the pendulum definition, and in 1855 Britain repealed the pendulum standard and returned to prototype standards.\nOther uses.\nSeismometers.\nA pendulum in which the rod is not vertical but almost horizontal was used in early seismometers for measuring Earth tremors. The bob of the pendulum does not move when its mounting does, and the difference in the movements is recorded on a drum chart.\nSchuler tuning.\nAs first explained by Maximilian Schuler in a 1923 paper, a pendulum whose period exactly equals the orbital period of a hypothetical satellite orbiting just above the surface of the Earth (about 84 minutes) will tend to remain pointing at the center of the Earth when its support is suddenly displaced. This principle, called Schuler tuning, is used in inertial guidance systems in ships and aircraft that operate on the surface of the Earth. No physical pendulum is used, but the control system that keeps the inertial platform containing the gyroscopes stable is modified so the device acts as though it is attached to such a pendulum, keeping the platform always facing down as the vehicle moves on the curved surface of the Earth.\nCoupled pendulums.\nIn 1665 Huygens made a curious observation about pendulum clocks. Two clocks had been placed on his mantlepiece, and he noted that they had acquired an opposing motion. That is, their pendulums were beating in unison but in the opposite direction; 180\u00b0 out of phase. Regardless of how the two clocks were started, he found that they would eventually return to this state, thus making the first recorded observation of a coupled oscillator.\nThe cause of this behavior was that the two pendulums were affecting each other through slight motions of the supporting mantlepiece. This process is called entrainment or mode locking in physics and is observed in other coupled oscillators. Synchronized pendulums have been used in clocks and were widely used in gravimeters in the early 20th century. Although Huygens only observed out-of-phase synchronization, recent investigations have shown the existence of in-phase synchronization, as well as \"death\" states wherein one or both clocks stops.\nReligious practice.\nPendulum motion appears in religious ceremonies as well. The swinging incense burner called a censer, also known as a thurible, is an example of a pendulum. Pendulums are also seen at many gatherings in eastern Mexico where they mark the turning of the tides on the day which the tides are at their highest point. Pendulums may also be used for dowsing.\nEducation.\nPendulums are widely used in science education as an example of a harmonic oscillator, to teach dynamics and oscillatory motion. One use is to demonstrate the law of conservation of energy. A heavy object such as a bowling ball or wrecking ball is attached to a string. The weight is then moved to within a few inches of a volunteer's face, then released and allowed to swing and come back. In most instances, the weight reverses direction and then returns to (almost) the same position as the original release location \u2014 \"i.e.\" a small distance from the volunteer's face \u2014 thus leaving the volunteer unharmed. On occasion the volunteer is injured if either the volunteer does not stand still or the pendulum is initially released with a push (so that when it returns it surpasses the release position). Another demonstration is the pendulum wave.\nTorture device.\nIt is claimed that the pendulum was used as an instrument of torture and execution by the Spanish Inquisition in the 18th century. The allegation is contained in the 1826 book \"The history of the Inquisition of Spain \" by the Spanish priest, historian and liberal activist Juan Antonio Llorente. A swinging pendulum whose edge is a knife blade slowly descends toward a bound prisoner until it cuts into his body. This method of torture came to popular consciousness through the 1842 short story \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" by American author Edgar Allan Poe.\nMost knowledgeable sources are skeptical that this torture was ever actually used. The only evidence of its use is one paragraph in the preface to Llorente's 1826 \"History\", relating a second-hand account by a single prisoner released from the Inquisition's Madrid dungeon in 1820, who purportedly described the pendulum torture method. Modern sources point out that due to Jesus' admonition against bloodshed, Inquisitors were only allowed to use torture methods which did not spill blood, and the pendulum method would have violated this stricture. One theory is that Llorente misunderstood the account he heard; the prisoner was actually referring to another common Inquisition torture, the \"strappado\" (garrucha), in which the prisoner has his hands tied behind his back and is hoisted off the floor by a rope tied to his hands. This method was also known as the \"pendulum\". Poe's popular horror tale, and public awareness of the Inquisition's other brutal methods, has kept the myth of this elaborate torture method alive.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe value of g reflected by the period of a pendulum varies from place to place. The gravitational force varies with distance from the center of the Earth, i.e. with altitude\u00a0\u2013 or because the Earth's shape is oblate, g varies with latitude.\nA more important cause of this reduction in g at the equator is because the equator is spinning at one revolution per day, so the acceleration by the gravitational force is partially canceled there by the centrifugal force.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Special Olympics competitions are held daily, all around the world\u2014including local, national and regional competitions, adding up to more than 100,000 events a year. Like the International Paralympic Committee, the Special Olympics organization is recognized by the International Olympic Committee; however, unlike the Paralympic Games, its World Games are not held in the same year nor in conjunction with the Olympic Games.\nThe Special Olympics World Games is a major event put on by the Special Olympics committee. The World Games generally alternate between summer and winter games, in two-year cycles, recurring every fourth year. The games were first held on July 20, 1968, in Chicago, Illinois, United States, with about 1,000 athletes from the U.S. and Canada. At those first games, honorary event chair Eunice Kennedy Shriver announced the formation of the Special Olympics organization. International participation expanded in subsequent games. In 2003, the first summer games held outside the United States were in Dublin, Ireland, with 7000 athletes from 150 countries. The most recent Summer Games were hosted in Berlin, Germany, between June 16 to 25, 2023.\nThe first World Winter Games were held in 1977 in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, US. Austria hosted the first Winter Games outside the United States in 1993. The most recent Special Olympics World Winter Games were held in Turino, Italy from March 8, 2025, to March 15, 2025. During the World Winter Games of 2013 in Pyeongchang, South Korea, the first Special Olympics Global Development Summit was held on \"Ending the Cycle of Poverty and Exclusion for People with Intellectual Disabilities\", gathering government officials, activists and business leaders from around the world.\nHistory.\nEunice Kennedy Shriver, sister of US president John F. Kennedy, believed that people with intellectual disabilities could be happy and live meaningful lives. Eunice founded the Special Olympics to positively change attitudes towards mentally handicapped people. In June 1963, Kennedy Shriver started a day camp called Camp Shriver for children with intellectual and physical disabilities at her home in Potomac, Maryland. The camp sought to address the concern that disabled children had very little opportunity to participate in organised athletic events. With Camp Shriver as an example, Kennedy Shriver, then head of the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation and a member of President John F. Kennedy's Panel on Mental Retardation, promoted the concept of involvement in physical activity and other opportunities for people with intellectual disabilities. Camp Shriver became an annual event, and the Kennedy Foundation gave grants to universities, recreation departments, and community centers to hold similar camps.\nAlso in the early 1960s, Kennedy Shriver wrote an article in the \"Saturday Evening Post\", stating that her sister, also President John F. Kennedy's sister, was born with intellectual disabilities. Her sister, Rosemary Kennedy was slow to learn, suffered seizures and mood swings. Her mother was told by doctors that Rosemary's situation was hopeless. In the early 1940s, Rosemary was prescribed a lobotomy, which left her incapacitated. This frank article about the President's family was seen as a \"watershed\" in changing public attitudes toward people with intellectual disabilities. Rosemary's disability provided Kennedy Shriver with an overall vision that people with intellectual disabilities could compete and at the same time unify together in public. It has often been said that Rosemary's disability was Eunice's inspiration to form Special Olympics (as the movement came to be called); Eunice told \"The New York Times\" in 1995 that that was not exactly the case. \"The games should not focus on one individual,\" she said.\nIn 1958, Dr. James N. Oliver of England had conducted pioneering research, including a ground-breaking study showing that physical exercise and activities for children with intellectual disabilities had positive effects that also carried over into the classroom (\"The Effects of Physical Conditioning Exercises and Activities on the Mental Characteristics of Educationally Sub-Normal Boys, British Journal of Educational Psychology, XXVIII, June 1958). Oliver in 1964 served as a consultant to Camp Shriver. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLet me win but if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt\n\u2013 Special Olympics athlete oath\nThe 1964 research of Dr. Frank Hayden, a Canadian physical education professor from London, Ontario, demonstrated that intellectually disabled people can and should participate in physical exercise. He believed that the benefits of such activity would be seen in all areas of the athletes' lives. With the help of a local school that offered space in its gym, Hayden started one of the first public organised sports programs, floor hockey for individuals with intellectual disabilities, in the fall of 1968. In the mid-1960s, Hayden also developed an idea for national games, and his work brought him to the attention of the Kennedy Foundation. He shared his ideas for national games, while taking a teaching sabbatical and working for the foundation.\nThe first Special Olympics games were held on July 20, 1968, at Soldier Field in Chicago. About 1,000 athletes from the U.S. and Canada took part in the one-day event, which was a joint venture by the Kennedy Foundation and the Chicago Park District. Anne McGlone Burke, then a physical education teacher with the Chicago Park District, began with the idea for a one-time, city-wide, Olympic-style athletic competition for people with special needs. Burke approached the Kennedy Foundation in 1967 to help fund the event. Kennedy Shriver, in turn, encouraged her to expand the idea beyond the city, and the foundation provided a grant of $25,000. When Burke had approached another charity for funding, she was told, \"You should be ashamed of yourself putting these kinds of kids on display\". The advisory committee to the Chicago Special Olympics included Dr. William Freeberg from Southern Illinois University, Dr. Hayden of the Kennedy Foundation, Dr. Arthur Peavy, Burke, William McFetridge, and Stephen Kelly of the Chicago Park District, as well as, Olympic decathlon champion Rafer Johnson. Kennedy Shriver was honorary chair. At the July 1968 games, Kennedy Shriver announced the formation of Special Olympics and that more games would be held every two years as a \"Biennial International Special Olympics\". Hayden served as the games executive director through 1972, and then in international development for the games. Some 2,500 participants were engaged in the 1970 games at Soldier Field.\nIn 1971, The U.S. Olympic Committee gave the Special Olympics official approval to use the name \"Olympics\". France sent the first athletes from outside North America to the second games held in 1970. The third games in 1972 saw 10 nations send athletes The first Special Olympics World Winter Games were held in February 1977 in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, U.S. The United Nations declared 1986, the year of the Special Olympics. In 1988, the Special Olympics was officially recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The first World Games held outside the U.S., were the winter games of 1993 in Salzburg and Schladming, Austria. The Austrian president was the first head of state to personally open the games.\nIn 1997, Healthy Athletes became an official Special Olympics initiative, offering health information and screenings to Special Olympics athletes worldwide. By 2010, the Healthy Athletes program had given free health screenings and treatment to more than 1 million people with intellectual disabilities.\nThe 2003 Special Olympics World Summer Games\u2014the first summer held outside of the United States\u2014took place in Dublin, Ireland. Approximately 7,000 athletes from 150 countries competed over 18 disciplines. The Dublin games were also the first to have their own opening and closing ceremonies broadcast live. President of Ireland Mary McAleese performed the ceremonial duties. The 2003 games dramatically changed the perceptions and attitudes of international society regarding the abilities and limitations of people with intellectual disabilities. The opening ceremony of the 2003 Games has been described by President McAleese as \"a time when Ireland was at its superb best\".\nOn October 30, 2004, President George W. Bush signed into law the \"Special Olympics Sport and Empowerment Act\", Public Law 108\u2013406. The bill authorized funding for its Healthy Athletes, Education, and Worldwide Expansion programs. Co-sponsored by representatives Roy Blunt (R-MO), and Steny Hoyer (D-MD), and senators Rick Santorum (R-PA) and Harry Reid (D-NV), the bills were passed by unanimous consent in both chambers. In July 2006, the first Special Olympics USA Games were held at Iowa State University. Teams from all 50 states and the District of Columbia participated.\nIn May 2016, Mary Davis of Dublin, Ireland, was named chief executive officer. She is the first CEO from outside the U.S. in the organization's history. From 2017 to 2019, US secretary of education Betsy DeVos attempted to eliminate federal funding for the Special Olympics. Each year the attempt was rejected by Congress, and the public outcry following a third annual attempt resulted in the funding being maintained in 2019. As part of the Special Olympics 50th Anniversary celebration in 2018, a new mission called the \"Inclusion Revolution\" was launched.\nSymbols.\nThe Special Olympics logo is based on the sculpture \"Joy and Happiness to All the Children of the World\" by Zurab Tsereteli. The State University of New York, Brockport, played host to the 1979 Summer Games and Tsereteli was then a visiting artist in residence at the university. He worked with the Kennedy Foundation and gifted the sculpture to the University. The \"stick figure\" is an abstract but humanistic form designed to convey the impression of movement and activity. The logo is meant to be a symbol of growth, confidence and joy among children and adults with disabilities.\nIn 2018, the Chicago Park District dedicated the \"Eternal Flame of Hope\" in honor of the Special Olympics. The sculpture by Richard Hunt stands in a plaza next to Soldier Field, where the first games were held 50 years earlier in 1968. The Flame of Hope is the name given to the torch that is carried to and lit at Special Olympics games.\nHosts of the Special Olympics World Games.\n1 Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, was originally selected to host the 2009 Special Olympics World Winter Games. Due to financial problems and the constant delay in reconstruction of the venues of the 1984 Winter Olympics, the city gave up hosting the Games, and Boise, Idaho, was invited to host the event.\n2 It was planned that \u00c5re and \u00d6stersund, Sweden would host the 2021 World Winter Games between February 2 to 13, 2021. However, on December 20, 2019, it was announced that the Swedish Paralympic Committee vetoed the necessary financing for the continuity of the event in the country, invalidating a promise made during the bid process, Special Olympics was forced to delay the event and in 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic arose. Kazan, Russia was announced winter host for 2022 on June 29, 2020. On March 4, 2022, it was announced that the Kazan games would be cancelled due to safety and economic concerns arising from the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nNational programs.\nAs of May 2023, there are 204 countries and territories, grouped into seven geographic regions. Due to legal issues, eight national programs don't use the official names of their countries in English but instead use their official names in their local languages.\nAfrica (40).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAsia-Pacific (35).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEast Asia (6).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEurasia (58).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAmerica and the Caribbean (43).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMiddle East and North Africa (22).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nParticipation.\nSpecial Olympics programs are available for athletes free of charge. More than 5.7 million athletes and Unified Sports partners are involved in Special Olympics sports training and competition in 204 countries and territories. The organization offers year-round training and competition in 32 Olympic-style summer and winter sports.\nPeople with intellectual disabilities are encouraged to join the Special Olympics for the physical activity, which helps lower the rate of cardiovascular disease and obesity, among other health benefits. Also, they gain many emotional and psychological benefits, including self-confidence, social competence, building greater athletic skills and higher self-esteem. Exercise has also been shown to be related to a decrease in anxiety levels amongst people with intellectual disabilities.\nTo participate in the Special Olympics, a person must be at least 8 years old and identified by an agency or professional as having one of the following conditions: intellectual disabilities, cognitive delays as measured by formal assessment, or significant learning or vocational problems due to cognitive delay that require or have required specially designed instruction. For young people with and without intellectual disabilities ages 2\u20137, Special Olympics has a Young Athletes program\u2014an inclusive sport and play program with a focus on activities that are important to mental and physical growth. Children engage in games and activities that develop motor skills and hand-eye coordination. Parents say their children in Young Athletes also develop better social skills. The confidence boost makes it easier for them to play and talk with other children on the playground and elsewhere. A study by the Center for Social Development and Education (University of Massachusetts, Boston) found that the activities also had the effect of helping children with intellectual disabilities learn routines and approaches to learning, along with how to follow rules and directions.\nFamilies can also get involved with the Special Olympics experience. Family members support their athletes to the best of their ability, which may involve attending or volunteering at the events. By being involved they can boost their athlete's self-esteem and will be looked at as a constant source of encouragement.\nVolunteers and supporters are an integral part of Special Olympics\u2014and millions of people around the world are committed to its programs. Some are sponsors or donors. Many others are coaches, event volunteers and fans.\nCoaches help the athletes be the best they can be regardless of ability\u2014or disability. Special Olympics trains coaches through the Coaching Excellence program, which includes partnering with sports organizations. Special Olympics volunteers are introduced to lifetime friendships and great rewards.\nThere are many events in which families and volunteers participate, but the biggest event is the Law Enforcement Torch Run, which involves police chiefs, police officers, secret service, FBI agents, military police, sheriffs, state troopers, prison guards, and other law enforcement personnel assembling to raise awareness and funds for Special Olympics. Ahead of a Special Olympics competition, law enforcement officers carry the torch in intervals along a planned route covering most of the state or country to the site of the opening ceremonies of the chapter or Special Olympics World Summer or Winter Games. Then they pass the torch to a Special Olympics athlete and together they run up to the cauldron and light it, signifying the beginning of the games.\nThe Special Olympics athlete's oath, which was first introduced by Eunice Kennedy Shriver at the inaugural Special Olympics international games in Chicago in 1968, is \"Let me win. But if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt.\" The origin of the oath came from Herbert J. Kramer, then Public Relations Advisor to the Kennedy Foundation.\nSports offered.\nIn 1968, track and field, swimming, and floor hockey were the first three official sports offered by Special Olympics. As in the Olympics, events are introduced in training and then added to the competitive schedule, and from there the list of sports and events continued to grow.\nSpecial Olympics has more than 30 Olympic-type individual and team sports that provide meaningful training and competition opportunities for people with intellectual disabilities. As of 2016[ [update]], these are:\nOther sports and sports-related programs include the Motor Activity Training Program and beach volleyball. Availability of sports can depend on location and season.\nA key difference between Special Olympics competitions and those of other sports organizations is that athletes of all ability levels are encouraged to participate. Competitions are structured so that athletes compete with other athletes of similar ability in equitable divisions. An athlete's ability is the primary factor in divisioning Special Olympics competitions. The ability of an athlete or team is determined by an entry score from a prior competition or the result of a seeding round or preliminary event at the competition itself. Other factors that are significant in establishing competitive divisions are age and gender.\nAt competitions, medals are awarded for first, second, and third place in each event, and ribbons are awarded to athletes who finish in fourth through eighth place.\nUnified Sports.\nIn recent years, Special Olympics has pioneered the concept of Unified Sports, bringing together athletes with and without intellectual disabilities as teammates. The basic concept is that training together and playing together can create a path to friendship and understanding. The program has expanded beyond the U.S. and North America: more than 1.4 million people worldwide now take part in Special Olympics Unified Sports. The goal is to break down stereotypes about people with intellectual disabilities and promote unity.\nBuilding on this, Special Olympics launched \"The Revolution Is Inclusion\", inviting people worldwide to sign the Inclusion Pledge. This campaign aimed at celebrating all abilities began as Special Olympics marked its 50th anniversary.\nA recent study of Special Olympics Unified Sports in Serbia, Poland, Ukraine, Germany and Hungary documented the benefits of Unified Sports, including the effect of changing attitudes toward people with intellectual disabilities. As one Unified Sports partner said, \"I am ashamed to say that I used to laugh at these people (people with intellectual disabilities), now I will tell anybody to stop laughing if I see it and I will stand up for people if I can.\" Other evaluations have also shown Unified Sports to be successful in building self-esteem and confidence in people with intellectual disabilities and also as a way to improve understanding and acceptance of people with intellectual disabilities among their non-disabled peers.\nThe Special Olympics Europe Eurasia Regional Research centre is based at the University of Ulster Jordanstown.\nAs part of their 50th anniversary, the Special Olympics created the first Unified Cup. The first competition is a soccer tournament with 440 athletes from 24 countries.\nUnified Robotics, a program that pairs Special Olympics students with FIRST Robotics students to build robots, began in 2016, and has been bringing opportunities for technological skill development to Special Olympics students in Washington state, Arizona, and in other regions since. Special Olympics Arizona also promotes inclusion through Unified Arts programming including robotics, music, photography, art competitions, and gardening.\nHealthy Athletes.\nAs the Special Olympics began to grow, staffers and volunteers began to notice that athletes\u2014children and adults with intellectual disabilities\u2014also had many untreated health problems. In 1997, Special Olympics began an initiative called Healthy Athletes, which offers health screenings to athletes in need.\nHealthy Athletes currently offers health screenings in eight areas: Fit Feet (podiatry), FUNfitness (physical therapy), Health Promotion (better health and well-being), Healthy Hearing (audiology), MedFest (sports physical exam), Opening Eyes (vision), Special Smiles (dentistry), Strong Minds (Emotional Health). Screenings educate athletes on health and also identify problems that may need additional follow-up. For example, the FUNfitness Program assess flexibility, strength, balance, and aerobic fitness of the athlete. Following the screen, the physical therapist would provide instructions on how to optimize their physical fitness in the areas screened.\nSince the Healthy Athletes program began, Special Olympics has become the largest global public health organization dedicated to serving people with intellectual disabilities. So far, more than 1.9 million Healthy Athletes screenings have been conducted for people with intellectual disabilities all around the world.\nThe Special Olympics health initiative has attracted high-profile partners, including the Hear the World Foundation, which screened more than 1,000 athletes during the most recent World Winter Games in Korea; more than 200 of them were found to have hearing loss.\nIn 2012, the Special Olympics Healthy Communities initiative launched in eight countries\u2014Kazakhstan, Malawi, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Romania, South Africa and Thailand, as well as six U.S. states. The goal is to improve the health and well-being of people with intellectual disabilities and allow them to reach their full potential.\nCriticism.\nScholar Keith Storey summarized common objections in a 2004 article in \"Journal of Disability Policy Studies\". One criticism directed at the organization pertains to the role that corporate sponsors play in it, which critics feel has led to degrading paternalism toward athletic ability. While corporate fundraising makes the games possible, critics argue, it provides good public relations for the sponsors, but does not result in integration of people with disabilities into the workforce at those companies. People with disabilities are also not widely represented on the Special Olympics' board of directors, as only two members have disabilities. This has been criticized as a double standard that reflects poorly on the disability rights movement where people with disabilities control the service delivery system rather than relying on people without disabilities.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She has sold over 45 million records, including 35 million in album sales worldwide, making her one of the most successful Canadian artists. Critics have noted Furtado's musical versatility and experimentation with genres.\nFurtado first gained fame with her trip hop-inspired debut studio album, \"Whoa, Nelly!\" (2000), which was a critical and commercial success that spawned two top-10 singles on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, \"I'm Like a Bird\" and \"Turn Off the Light\". The former won her a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Furtado's introspective folk-heavy 2003 second studio album, \"Folklore\", explored her Portuguese roots. Its singles received moderate success in Europe, but the album's underperformance compared to her debut was regarded as a sophomore slump.\nFurtado's third studio album, \"Loose\" (2006), became her bestselling album, with more than 10 million copies sold worldwide, also making it one of the bestselling albums of the 2000s. Considered a radical image reinvention, the album spawned four number-one singles worldwide: \"Promiscuous\" (featuring Timbaland), \"Maneater\", \"Say It Right\", and \"All Good Things (Come to an End)\". Her 2007 feature on Timbaland's \"Give It to Me\" in the same era also topped the charts in the US and overseas. Furtado's critically acclaimed duet with James Morrison, \"Broken Strings\", also topped the charts in Europe in 2008.\nShe released her first Spanish-language album, \"Mi Plan\", in 2009, which won her a Latin Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Album. In 2012, Furtado released her nostalgia-inspired fifth album \"The Spirit Indestructible\". Furtado split with her management and went independent thereafter, releasing her indie-pop sixth studio album, \"The Ride\", in 2017 under her own label Nelstar Entertainment[]. Her seventh studio album, \"7\", was released in September 2024.\nShe has won many awards throughout her career, including one Grammy Award from seven nominations, one Latin Grammy Award, ten Juno Awards, one BRIT Award, one \"Billboard\" Music Award, one MTV Europe Music Award, one World Music Award, and three Much Music Video Awards. Furtado has a star on Canada's Walk of Fame, and was awarded Commander of the Order of Prince Henry on February 28, 2014, by An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva, the then-President of Portugal.\nEarly life.\nFurtado was born on December 2, 1978, in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. Her Portuguese parents, Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Furtado and Maria Manuela Furtado, were born on S\u00e3o Miguel Island in the Azores and had immigrated to Canada in the late 1960s. Nelly was named after Soviet gymnast Nellie Kim. Her elder siblings are Michael Anthony and Lisa Anne. They were raised Catholic. At age 4, she began performing and singing in Portuguese. Furtado's first public performance was when she sang a duet with her mother at a church on Portugal Day. She began playing musical instruments at the age of nine, learning the trombone, ukulele and, in later years, the guitar and keyboards. At the age of 12, she began writing songs, and as a teenager, she performed in a Portuguese marching band. Furtado has acknowledged her family as the source of her strong work ethic; she spent eight summers working as a chambermaid with her mother, along with her brother and sister, who was a housekeeper in Victoria.\nCareer.\n1996\u20131999: Career beginnings.\nAfter graduating from Mount Douglas Secondary School in 1996, she moved to Toronto to live with her sister. There, she got a full-time job at an alarm company. Later, she met Tallis Newkirk, member of the hip hop group Plains of Fascination. She contributed vocals to their 1996 album, \"Join the Ranks\", on the track \"Waitin' 4 the Streets\". The following year, she formed Nelstar, a trip hop duo with Newkirk. Ultimately, Furtado felt the trip hop style of the duo was \"too segregated\", and believed it did not represent her personality or allow her to showcase her vocal ability. She left the group and planned to move back home.\nIn 1997, she performed at the Honey Jam talent show. Her performance attracted the attention of The Philosopher Kings singer Gerald Eaton, who then approached her to write with him. He and fellow Kings member Brian West helped Furtado produce a demo. She left Toronto, but returned again to record more material with Eaton and West. The material recorded during these sessions was shopped to record companies by her attorney Chris Taylor and led to her 1999 record deal with DreamWorks Records, signed by A&amp;R executive Beth Halper, partner of Garbage drummer and record producer Butch Vig. Furtado's first single, \"Party's Just Begun (Again)\", was released that year on the for \"Brokedown Palace\" (1999).\n2000\u20132005: \"Whoa, Nelly!\" and \"Folklore\".\nFurtado continued the collaboration with Eaton and West, who co-produced her debut album, \"Whoa, Nelly!\", which was released in October 2000. The album was an international success, supported by three international singles: \"I'm Like a Bird\", \"Turn Off the Light\", and \"...On the Radio (Remember the Days)\". It received four Grammy nominations in 2002, and her debut single won for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Furtado's work was also critically acclaimed for her innovative mixture of various genres and sounds. \"Slant Magazine\" called the album \"a delightful and refreshing antidote to the army of 'pop princesses' and rap-metal bands that had taken over popular music at the turn of the millennium\". The sound of the album was strongly influenced by musicians who had traversed cultures and \"the challenge of making heartfelt, emotional music that's upbeat and hopeful\". According to \"Maclean's\" magazine, \"Whoa, Nelly!\" had sold six million copies worldwide as of August 2006. Portions of the song \"Scared of You\" are in Portuguese, while \"Onde Est\u00e1s\" is entirely in Portuguese, reflecting Furtado's Portuguese heritage. Following the release of the album, Furtado headlined the \"Burn in the Spotlight Tour\" and also appeared on Moby's \"Area:One\" tour.\nIn 2002, Furtado appeared on the song \"Thin Line\", on underground hip hop group Jurassic 5's album \"Power in Numbers\". The same year, Furtado provided her vocals to the Paul Oakenfold song \"The Harder They Come\" from the album \"Bunkka\". She also had a collaboration with Colombian artist Juanes in the song \"Fotograf\u00eda\" (\"Photograph\"), where she demonstrated her command of the Spanish language. Furtado was also featured in \"Breath\" from Swollen Members' \"Monsters in the Closet\" release; the video for \"Breath\", directed by Spawn creator Todd McFarlane, won the 2003 Western Canadian Music Awards Outstanding Video and MuchVIBE Best Rap Video. In 2002, Furtado was the recipient of an International Achievement Award at the SOCAN Awards in Toronto for her song \"I'm Like a Bird\".\nFurtado's second album, \"Folklore\", was released in November 2003. One of the tracks on the album, \"Childhood Dreams\", was dedicated to her infant daughter. The album includes the single \"For\u00e7a\", the official anthem of the UEFA Euro 2004. Furtado performed the song in Lisbon in the final of the tournament, in which Portugal's national team played. The lead single released was \"Powerless (Say What You Want)\" and the second single was the ballad \"Try\". The album was not as successful as her debut, partly due to the album's less \"poppy\" sound, as well as underpromotion from her label DreamWorks Records. DreamWorks had just been sold to Universal Music Group at the time of the album's release. In 2005, DreamWorks Records and many of its artists, including Furtado, were absorbed into Geffen Records. \"Powerless (Say What You Want)\" was later remixed into a Spanish version called \"Abre Tu Coraz\u00f3n\", featuring Juanes, who had previously worked with Furtado on his track \"Fotograf\u00eda\". The two collaborated again on \"Te Busqu\u00e9\" (\"I Searched for You\"), a single from Furtado's 2006 album \"Loose\". In 2003, Furtado won an International Achievement Award at the SOCAN Awards in Toronto for her song \"Turn Off the Light\".\n2006\u20132008: \"Loose\".\nFurtado's third album, named \"Loose\", after the spontaneous, creative decisions she made while creating the album, was released in June 2006. In this album, primarily produced by Timbaland, Furtado experiments with sounds from R&amp;B, hip hop, and 1980s music. Furtado herself describes the album's sound as \"punk-hop\", described as \"modern, poppy, spooky\" and as having \"a mysterious, after-midnight vibe... extremely visceral\". She attributed the youthful sound of the album to the presence of her two-year-old daughter. The album received generally positive reviews from critics, with some citing the \"revitalising\" effect of Timbaland on Furtado's music, and others calling it \"slick, smart and surprising\".\n\"Loose\" became the most successful album of Furtado's career to date, as it reached number one, not only in Canada and the United States, but also several countries worldwide. The album produced her first number-one hit in the United States, \"Promiscuous\", as well as her first number-one hit in the United Kingdom, \"Maneater\". The single \"Say It Right\" eventually became Furtado's most successful song worldwide, due to its huge success in Europe and in the United States, where it became her second number-one hit. \"All Good Things (Come to an End)\" became her most successful song in Europe, topping single charts in numerous countries there. On February 16, 2007, Furtado embarked on the \"Get Loose Tour\". She returned in March 2007 to her hometown of Victoria to perform a concert at the Save-On Foods Memorial Centre.

The song topped the charts in New Zealand and was successful in European territories as well as her native Canada. It also charted on the Billboard Hot 100. \"The Spirit Indestructible\" was released in September 2012. Furtado previously proclaimed that the album was most like her 2000 debut \"Whoa, Nelly!\", but containing elements from urban, alternative, and reggae. The album's influences include Janelle Mon\u00e1e, The xx, and Florence + the Machine. The album had input from producers such as The Neptunes, Ti\u00ebsto, Timbaland, Rick Nowels, Ryan Tedder, and Rodney Jerkins.\nThe first single from \"The Spirit Indestructible\", \"Big Hoops (Bigger the Better)\", was released digitally on April 17, 2012 and was sent to North American radio stations on May 1, 2012.

Academic research has described DIY as behaviors where \"individuals use raw and semi-raw materials and parts to produce, transform, or reconstruct material possessions, including those drawn from the natural environment (e.g., landscaping)\". DIY behavior can be triggered by various motivations previously categorized as marketplace motivations (economic benefits, lack of product availability, lack of product quality, need for customization), and identity enhancement (craftsmanship, empowerment, community seeking, uniqueness).\nThe term \"do-it-yourself\" has been associated with consumers since at least 1912 primarily in the domain of home improvement and maintenance activities. The phrase \"do it yourself\" had come into common usage (in standard English) by the 1950s, in reference to the emergence of a trend of people undertaking home improvement and various other small craft and construction projects as both a creative-recreational and cost-saving activity.\nSubsequently, the term DIY has taken on a broader meaning that covers a wide range of skill sets. DIY has been described as a \"self-made-culture\"; one of designing, creating, customizing and repairing items or things without any special training. DIY has grown to become a social concept with people sharing ideas, designs, techniques, methods and finished projects with one another either online or in person.\nDIY can be seen as a cultural reaction in modern technological society to increasing academic specialization and economic specialization which brings people into contact with only a tiny focus area within the larger context, positioning DIY as a venue for holistic engagement. DIY ethic is the ethic of self-sufficiency through completing tasks without the aid of a paid expert. The DIY ethic promotes the idea that anyone is capable of performing a variety of tasks rather than relying on paid specialists.\nHistory.\nItalian archaeologists have unearthed the ruins of a 6th-century BC Greek structure in southern Italy. The ruins appeared to come with detailed assembly instructions and are being called an \"ancient IKEA building\". The structure was a temple-like building discovered at Torre Satriano, near the southern city of Potenza, in Basilicata. This region was recognized as a place where local people mingled with Greeks who had settled along the southern coast known as Magna Graecia and in Sicily from the 8th century BC onwards. Christopher Smith, director of the British School at Rome, said that the discovery was, \"the clearest example yet found of mason's marks of the time. It looks as if someone was instructing others how to mass-produce components and put them together in this way.\" Much like our modern instruction booklets, various sections of the luxury building were inscribed with coded symbols showing how the pieces slotted together. The characteristics of these inscriptions indicate they date back to around the 6th century BC, which tallies with the architectural evidence suggested by the decoration. The building was built by Greek artisans coming from the Spartan colony of Taranto in Apulia.\nIn North America, there was a DIY magazine publishing niche in the first half of the twentieth century. Magazines such as \"Popular Mechanics\" (founded in 1902) and \"Mechanix Illustrated\" (founded in 1928) offered a way for readers to keep current on useful practical skills, techniques, tools, and materials. As many readers lived in rural or semi-rural regions, initially much of the material related to their needs on the farm or in a small town. In addition, authors such as F. J. Christopher began to become heavy advocates for do-it-yourself projects.\nBy the 1950s, DIY became common usage with the emergence of people undertaking home improvement projects, construction projects and smaller crafts. Artists began to fight against mass production and mass culture by claiming to be self-made. However, DIY practices also responded to geopolitical tensions, such as in the form of home-made Cold War nuclear fallout shelters, and the dark aesthetics and nihilist discourse in punk fanzines in the 1970s and onwards in the shadow of rising unemployment and social tensions. In the 1960s and 1970s, books and TV shows about the DIY movement and techniques on building and home decoration began appearing. By the 1990s, the DIY movement felt the impact of the digital age with the rise of the internet. With computers and the internet becoming mainstream, increased accessibility to the internet has led to more households undertaking DIY methods. Platforms, such as YouTube or Instagram, provide people the opportunity to share their creations and instruct others on how to replicate DIY techniques in their own home.\nThe DIY movement is a re-introduction (often to urban and suburban dwellers) of the old pattern of personal involvement and use of skills in the upkeep of a house or apartment, making clothes; maintenance of cars, computers, websites; or any material aspect of living. The philosopher Alan Watts (from the \"Houseboat Summit\" panel discussion in a 1967 edition of the \"San Francisco Oracle\") reflected a growing sentiment:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Our educational system, in its entirety, does nothing to give us any kind of material competence. In other words, we don't learn how to cook, how to make clothes, how to build houses, how to make love, or to do any of the absolutely fundamental things of life. The whole education that we get for our children in school is entirely in terms of abstractions. It trains you to be an insurance salesman or a bureaucrat, or some kind of cerebral character.\nIn the 1970s, DIY spread through the North American population of college and recent-college-graduate age groups. In part, this movement involved the renovation of affordable, rundown older homes. But, it also related to various projects expressing the social and environmental vision of the 1960s and early 1970s. The young visionary Stewart Brand, working with friends and family, and initially using the most basic of typesetting and page-layout tools, developed the first edition of \"The Whole Earth Catalog\" (subtitled \"Access to Tools\") in late 1968. The venture was partially financed by friend and mentor Dick Raymond. Raymond's non-profit, the Portola Institute, published the Catalog, and the surprising success of editions in the 1970s led to a distribution arrangement with the New York publisher Random House.\nThe first \"Catalog\", and its successors, used a broad definition of the term \"tools.\" There were informational tools, such as books (often technical in nature), professional journals, courses and classes. There were specialized, designed items, such as carpentry and stonemasonry tools, garden tools, welding equipment, chainsaws, fiberglass materials and so on \u2013 even early personal computers. The designer J. Baldwin served as technology editor and wrote many of the reviews of fabrication tools, tools for working soil, etc. The \"Catalog\"'s publication both emerged from and spurred the great wave of experimentalism, convention-breaking, and do-it-yourself attitude of the late 1960s. Often copied, the \"Catalog\" appealed to a wide cross-section of people in North America and had a broad influence.\nDIY home improvement books burgeoned in the 1970s, first created as collections of magazine articles. An early, extensive line of DIY how-to books were created by Sunset Books, based upon previously published articles from their magazine, \"Sunset\", based in California. Time-Life, Better Homes and Gardens, Balcony Garden Web and other publishers soon followed suit.\nIn the mid-1990s, DIY home-improvement content began to find its way onto the World Wide Web. HouseNet was the earliest bulletin-board style site where users could share information. Since the late 1990s, DIY has exploded on the Web through thousands of sites.\nIn the 1970s, when home video (VCRs) came along, DIY instructors quickly grasped its potential for demonstrating processes by audio-visual means. In 1979, the PBS television series \"This Old House\", starring Bob Vila, premiered and spurred a DIY television revolution. The show was immensely popular, educating people on how to improve their living conditions (and the value of their house) without the expense of paying someone else to do (as much of) the work. In 1994, the HGTV Network cable television channel was launched in the United States and Canada, followed in 1999 by the DIY Network cable television channel. Both were launched to appeal to the growing percentage of North Americans interested in DIY topics, from home improvement to knitting. Such channels have multiple shows revealing how to stretch one's budget to achieve professional-looking results (\"Design Cents\", \"Design on a Dime\", etc.) while doing the work yourself. \"Toolbelt Diva\" specifically caters to female DIYers.\nBeyond magazines and television, the scope of home improvement DIY continues to grow online where most mainstream media outlets now have extensive DIY-focused informational websites such as \"This Old House\", Martha Stewart, Hometalk, and the DIY Network. These are often extensions of their magazine or television brand. The growth of independent online DIY resources is also spiking. The number of homeowners who blog about their experiences continues to grow, along with DIY websites from smaller organizations.\nIn the 21st century, DIY culture has expanded through online video platforms such as YouTube, where creators share tutorials and creative projects. New Zealand YouTuber David Jones has produced DIY cardboard builds and large-scale projects shared online.\nFashion.\nDIY is prevalent amongst the fashion community, with ideas being shared on social media, such as YouTube, about clothing, jewellery, makeup, and hairstyles. Techniques include distressing and bleaching jeans, redesigning old shirts, and studding denim.\nThe concept of DIY has also emerged within the art and design community. The terms Hacktivist, Craftivist, or maker have been used to describe creatives working within a DIY framework (Busch). Otto von Busch describes 'Hacktivism' as \"[including] the participant in the process of making, [to give] rise to new attitudes within the 'maker' or collaborator\" (Busch 49). Busch suggests that by engaging in participatory forms of fashion, consumers are able to step away from the idea of \"mass-homogenized 'Mc-Fashion'\" https://, as fashion Hacktivism allows consumers to play a more active role in engaging with the clothes they wear (Busch 32).\nSubculture.\nDIY as a subculture was brought forward by the punk movement of the 1970s. Instead of traditional means of bands reaching their audiences through large music labels, bands began recording, manufacturing albums and merchandise, booking their own tours, and creating opportunities for smaller bands to get wider recognition through repetitive low-cost DIY touring. The burgeoning zine movement took up coverage of and promotion of the underground punk scenes, and significantly altered the way fans interacted with musicians. Zines quickly branched off from being hand-made music magazines to become more personal; they quickly became one of the youth culture's gateways to DIY culture. This led to tutorial zines showing others how to make their own shirts, posters, zines, books, food, etc.\nThe terms \"DIY\" and \"do-it-yourself\" are also used to describe:\nMusic.\nMuch contemporary DIY music has its origins in the late 1970s punk rock subculture. It developed as a way to circumnavigate the corporate mainstream music industry. By controlling the entire production and distribution chain, DIY bands attempt to develop a closer relationship between artists and fans. The DIY ethic gives total control over the final product without need to compromise with record major labels.\nAccording to the punk aesthetic, one can express oneself and produce moving and serious works with limited means. Arguably, the earliest example of this attitude was the punk music scene of the 1970s.\nMore recently, the orthodox understanding that DIY originates in 1970s punk, with its clearest practices being in the self-produced 7\" single and self-published fanzines, has been challenged. As George McKay asks in the title of his 2023 article: 'Was punk DIY? Is DIY punk?' McKay argues instead for what he terms a 'depunking' of DIY. \nRiot grrrl, associated with third-wave feminism, also adopted the core values of the DIY punk ethic by leveraging creative ways of communication through zines and other projects.\nAdherents of the DIY punk ethic also work collectively. For example, punk impresario David Ferguson's CD Presents was a DIY concert production, recording studio, and record label network.\nFilm.\nA form of independent filmmaking characterized by low budgets, minimal crews, and simple props using whatever is available.\nBy country.\nAs a means of adaptation during the Cuban Special Period times of economic crisis, \"resolver\" (\"to resolve\") became an important part of Cuban culture. \"Resolver\" refers to a spirit of resourcefulness and do-it-yourself problem solving.\nIndia.\nJugaad is a colloquial Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Sindhi and Urdu word, which refers to a non-conventional, frugal innovation, often termed a \"hack\". It could also refer to an innovative fix or a simple work-around, a solution that bends the rules, or a resource that can be used in such a way. It is also often used to signify creativity: to make existing things work, or to create new things with meager resources.\nUnited States.\nRasquache is the English form of the Spanish term , originally with a negative connotation in Mexico it was recontextualized by the Mexican and Chicano arts movement to describe a specific artistic aesthetic, \"Rasquachismo\", suited to overcoming material and professional limitations faced by artists in the movement.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSubculture links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As they were permitted to vote only after 14 years residence, they protested to the British authorities in the Cape. Negotiations failed at the botched Bloemfontein Conference in June 1899. The conflict broke out in October after the British government decided to send 10,000 troops.\nThe war had three phases. In the first, the Boers mounted preemptive strikes into British-held territory in Natal and the Cape Colony, besieging British garrisons at Ladysmith, Mafeking, and Kimberley. The Boers won victories at Stormberg, Magersfontein, Colenso and Spion Kop. In the second phase, British fortunes changed when their commanding officer, General Redvers Buller, was replaced by Lord Roberts and Lord Kitchener, who relieved the besieged cities and invaded the Boer republics at the head of a 180,000-strong expeditionary force. The Boers, aware they were unable to resist such a force, refrained from fighting pitched battles, allowing the British to occupy both republics and their capitals. Boer politicians fled or went into hiding; the British annexed the two republics in 1900. In Britain, the Conservative ministry attempted to capitalise by calling an early general election, dubbed a \"khaki election\". In the third phase, Boer fighters launched a guerrilla campaign. They used hit-and-run attacks and ambushes against the British for two years.\nThe campaign proved difficult for the British to defeat, due to unfamiliarity with guerrilla tactics and support among civilians. British high command ordered scorched earth policies as part of a counterinsurgency campaign. Over 100,000 Boer civilians were forcibly relocated into concentration camps, where 26,000 died, by starvation and disease. Black Africans were interned to prevent them from supplying the Boers; 20,000 died. British mounted infantry were deployed to track down guerrillas, and few combatants were killed in action, most dying from disease. Kitchener offered terms to remaining Boer leaders to end the conflict. Eager to ensure Boers were released from the camps, most Boer commanders accepted the terms in the Treaty of Vereeniging, surrendering in May 1902. The former republics were transformed into the British colonies of the Transvaal and Orange River, and in 1910 were merged with the Natal and Cape Colonies to form the Union of South Africa, a self-governing colony within the British Empire.\nBritish expeditionary efforts were aided significantly by colonial forces from the Cape Colony, the Natal, Rhodesia, and many volunteers from the British Empire. Black African recruits contributed increasingly to the British effort. International public opinion was sympathetic to the Boers and hostile to the British. Even within the UK, there existed significant opposition to the war. As a result, the Boer cause attracted volunteers from neutral countries, including the German Empire, US, Russia and parts of the British Empire such as Australia and Ireland. Some consider the war the beginning of questioning the British Empire's global dominance, due to the war's surprising duration and unforeseen losses suffered by the British. A trial for British war crimes, including the killings of civilians and prisoners, was opened in January 1902. The war had a lasting effect on the region and on British domestic politics.\nName.\nThe conflict is commonly referred to simply as \"the Boer War\" because the First Boer War (1880-81) was much smaller. \"Boer\" (meaning \"farmer\") is the common name for Afrikaans-speaking white South Africans descended from the Dutch East India Company's settlers at the Cape of Good Hope. Among some South Africans, it is known as the (Second) Anglo\u2013Boer War. In Afrikaans, it is called the ' (\"Second Freedom War\"), ' (\"Second Boer War\"), (\"Anglo\u2013Boer War\") or (\"English War\").\nIn South Africa, it is officially called the South African War. According to a 2011 BBC report, \"most scholars prefer to call the war of 1899\u20131902 the South African War, thereby acknowledging that all South Africans, white and black, were affected by the war and that many were participants\".\nOrigins.\nThe war's origins were complex and stemmed from a century of conflict between the Boers and Britain. Of immediate importance, however, was the question of who would control and benefit most from the lucrative Witwatersrand gold mines discovered in 1884.\nEuropean settlement.\nThe first European settlement in South Africa was founded at the Cape of Good Hope in 1652, and administered as part of the Dutch Cape Colony. As a result of political turmoil in the Netherlands, the British occupied the Cape three times during the Napoleonic Wars, and the occupation became permanent after the Battle of Blaauwberg in 1806. The colony was then home to about 26,000 colonists settled under Dutch rule. Most represented old Dutch families brought to the Cape during the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Broadly speaking, the colonists included distinct subgroups, including the Boers. The Boers were itinerant farmers who lived on the colony's frontiers, seeking better pastures for their livestock. Many were dissatisfied with aspects of British administration, in particular with Britain's abolition of slavery in 1834. Boers who used forced labor were unable to collect compensation for their slaves.\nBetween 1836 and 1852, many elected to migrate away from British rule in what became known as the Great Trek. Around 15,000 trekking Boers departed the Cape Colony and followed the eastern coast towards Natal. After Britain annexed Natal in 1843, they journeyed farther north into South Africa's eastern interior. There, they established two independent Boer republics: the South African Republic (1852; also known as the Transvaal Republic) and the Orange Free State (1854).\nScramble for Africa.\nThe southern part of Africa was dominated in the 19th century by a set of struggles to create within it a single unified state. In 1868, Britain annexed Basutoland in the Drakensberg Mountains, following an appeal from Moshoeshoe I, the king of the Sotho people, who sought British protection against the Boers. While the Berlin Conference of 1884\u20131885 sought to draw boundaries between the European powers' African possessions, it also set the stage for further scrambles. Britain attempted to annex first the South African Republic in 1880, and then, in 1899, both the South African Republic and the Orange Free State.\nIn the 1880s, Bechuanaland (modern Botswana) became the object of a dispute between the Germans to the west, the Boers to the east, and Britain's Cape Colony to the south. Although Bechuanaland had no economic value, the \"Missionaries Road\" passed through it towards territory farther north. After the Germans annexed Damaraland and Namaqualand (modern Namibia) in 1884, Britain annexed Bechuanaland in 1885.\nIn the First Boer War of 1880\u20131881 the Boers of the Transvaal Republic proved skilful fighters in resisting Britain's attempt at annexation, causing a series of British defeats. The British government of William Ewart Gladstone was unwilling to become mired in a distant war, requiring substantial troop reinforcement and expense, for what was perceived at the time to be a minimal return. An armistice ended the war, and subsequently a peace treaty was signed with the Transvaal President Paul Kruger.\nWitwatersrand Gold Rush.\nIn June 1884, British imperial interests were ignited in the discovery by Jan Gerrit Bantjes of what would prove to be the world's largest deposit of gold ore at an outcrop on a ridge south of the Boer capital at Pretoria. The ridge was known locally as the \"Witwatersrand\" (white water ridge, a watershed). A gold rush to the Transvaal brought thousands of British and other prospectors from around the globe and over the border from the Cape Colony, which had been under British control since 1806.\nThe city of Johannesburg sprang up nearly overnight as a shanty town. \"Uitlanders\" (foreigners, white outsiders) poured in and settled around the mines. The influx was so rapid that uitlanders quickly outnumbered the Boers in Johannesburg and along the Rand, although they remained a minority in the Transvaal. The Boers, nervous and resentful of the uitlanders' growing presence, sought to contain their influence through requiring lengthy residential qualifying periods before voting rights could be obtained; by imposing taxes on the gold industry; and introducing controls through licensing, tariffs and administrative requirements. Among the issues giving rise to tension between the Transvaal government on the one hand and the uitlanders and British interests on the other, were:\nBritish imperial interests were alarmed when in 1894\u201395 Kruger proposed building a railway through Portuguese East Africa to Delagoa Bay, bypassing British-controlled ports in Natal and Cape Town and avoiding British tariffs. The Prime Minister of the Cape Colony was Cecil Rhodes, a man driven by a vision of a British-controlled Africa extending from the Cape to Cairo. \"Uitlander\" representatives and British mine owners became increasingly frustrated and angered by their dealings with the Transvaal government. A Reform Committee (Transvaal) was formed to represent the uitlanders.\nJameson Raid.\nIn 1895, a plan to take Johannesburg, and end the control of the Transvaal government, was hatched with the connivance of Cape Prime Minister Rhodes and Johannesburg gold magnate Alfred Beit. A column of 600 armed men was led over the border from Bechuanaland towards Johannesburg by Leander Starr Jameson, the Administrator in Rhodesia of the British South Africa Company, of which Rhodes was the chairman. The column, mainly made up of Rhodesian and Bechuanaland British South Africa Policemen, was equipped with Maxim machine guns and artillery pieces.\nThe plan was to make a three-day dash to Johannesburg and trigger an uprising by the primarily British expatriate uitlanders, organised by the Johannesburg Reform Committee, before the Boer commandos could mobilise. However, the Transvaal authorities had warning of the raid and tracked it from when it crossed the border. Four days later, the dispirited column was surrounded near Krugersdorp, within sight of Johannesburg. After a skirmish in which the column lost 65 killed and wounded\u2014while the Boers lost one man\u2014Jameson's men surrendered and were arrested.\nThe botched raid had repercussions throughout southern Africa and Europe. In Rhodesia, the departure of so many policemen enabled the Matabele and Mashona peoples' rising against the British South Africa Company. The rebellion, known as the Second Matabele War, was suppressed only at a great cost.\nA few days after the raid, the German Kaiser sent the \"Kruger telegram\", congratulating President Kruger and the government of the South African Republic on their success. When the text was disclosed in the British press, it generated a storm of anti-German feeling. In the baggage of the raiding column, to the embarrassment of Britain, the Boers found telegrams from Rhodes and other plotters in Johannesburg. Chamberlain had approved Rhodes' plans to send armed assistance in the case of a Johannesburg uprising, but he quickly moved to condemn the raid. Rhodes was censured at the Cape and London parliamentary inquiries, and forced to resign as Prime Minister and Chairman of the British South Africa Company.\nThe Boer government handed their prisoners over to the British for trial. Jameson was tried in England, where the press and London society, inflamed by anti-Boer and anti-German feeling and in a frenzy of jingoism, treated him as a hero. Although sentenced to 15 months imprisonment, Jameson was rewarded by being named Prime Minister of the Cape Colony (1904\u201308) and ultimately anointed as one of the founders of the Union of South Africa. For conspiring with Jameson, the uitlander members of the Reform Committee (Transvaal) were tried in the Transvaal courts and found guilty of treason. The four leaders were sentenced to death, but this was commuted to 15 years' imprisonment. In 1896, the other members of the committee were released on payment of \u00a32,000 in fines, all paid by Rhodes. One Reform Committee member, Frederick Gray, committed suicide while in Pretoria jail. His death was a factor in softening the Transvaal government's attitude to the surviving prisoners.\nJan C. Smuts wrote, in 1906:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe raid alienated many Cape Afrikaners from Britain and united the Transvaal Boers behind President Kruger and his government. It drew the Transvaal and Orange Free State together in opposition to British imperialism. In 1897, the two republics concluded a military pact.\nArming the Boers.\nKruger re-equipped the Transvaal army, importing 37,000 of the latest 7x57 mm Mauser Model 1895 rifles supplied by Germany, and 40 to 50\u00a0million rounds of ammunition. Some commandos used the Martini-Henry Mark III, because thousands of these had been purchased. Unfortunately, the large puff of white smoke after firing gave away the shooter's position. Roughly 7,000 Guedes 1885 rifles had also been purchased a few years earlier, and these were also used during the hostilities.\nAs the war went on, some commandos relied on captured British rifles, such as the Lee-Metford and Enfield. When the ammunition for the Mausers ran out, the Boers relied primarily on the captured Lee-Metfords. Few Boers used bayonets.\nThe Boers also purchased the best European German Krupp artillery. By October 1899, the Transvaal State Artillery had 73 heavy guns, including four 155\u00a0mm Creusot fortress guns and 25 of the 37\u00a0mm Maxim Nordenfeldt guns.\nThe Boers' Maxim, larger than the British Maxims, was a large calibre, belt-fed, water-cooled \"auto cannon\" that fired explosive rounds at 450 rounds per minute. It became known as the \"Pom Pom\".\nThe Transvaal army was transformed: approximately 25,000 men equipped with modern rifles and artillery could mobilise within two weeks. However, Kruger's victory in the Jameson Raid did nothing to resolve the fundamental problem of finding a formula to conciliate the uitlanders, without surrendering the independence of the Transvaal.\nBritish case for war.\nThe failure to gain improved rights for uitlanders (notably the dynamite tax) became a pretext for war and justification for a military build-up in Cape Colony. The case for war was developed and espoused as far away as the Australian colonies. Cape Colony Governor Sir Alfred Milner; Rhodes; Chamberlain; and mining syndicate owners such as Beit, Barney Barnato, and Lionel Phillips, favoured annexation of the Boer republics. Confident that the Boers would be quickly defeated, they planned and organised a short war, citing the uitlanders' grievances as the motivation. In contrast, the influence of the war party within the British government was limited. Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, despised jingoism. He was uncertain of the abilities of the British Army. Despite his moral and practical reservations, Salisbury led the UK to war to preserve the Empire's prestige and a feeling of obligation to British South Africans. Salisbury detested the Boers treatment of native Africans, referring to the London Convention of 1884, following Britain's defeat in the first war, as an agreement \"really in the interest of slavery\". Salisbury was not alone in this. Roger Casement, already on the way to becoming an Irish Nationalist, was nevertheless happy to gather intelligence for the British against the Boers because of their cruelty to Africans.\nThe British government went against the advice of its generals and declined to send substantial reinforcements to South Africa before war broke out. Secretary of State for War Lansdowne did not believe the Boers were preparing for war and that if Britain were to send large numbers of troops, it would strike too aggressive a posture and possibly derail a negotiated settlement\u2014or even encourage a Boer attack.\nNegotiations fail.\nSteyn of the Orange Free State invited Milner and Kruger to attend a conference in Bloemfontein. The conference started on 30 May 1899, but negotiations quickly broke down, as Kruger had no intention of granting meaningful concessions, and Milner had no intention of accepting his normal delaying tactics.\nOn 9 October 1899, after convincing the Orange Free State to join him and mobilising their forces, Kruger issued an ultimatum giving Britain 48 hours to withdraw troops from the border of Transvaal, despite the fact the only regular British troops near the border of either republic were 4 companies deployed to defend Kimberley. Otherwise, the Transvaal, allied with the Orange Free State, would declare war. News of the ultimatum reached London on the day it expired. The editor of the \"Times\" purportedly laughed out loud when he read it, saying 'an official document is seldom amusing and useful yet this was both'. \"The Times\" denounced the ultimatum as an 'extravagant farce' and \"The Globe\" denounced this 'trumpery little state'. Most editorials were similar to the \"Daily Telegraph's\", which declared: 'of course there can only be one answer to this grotesque challenge. Kruger has asked for war and war he must have!'\nSuch views were far from those of the British government and the army. Army reform had been a matter of pressing concern since the 1870s, put off because the public did not want the expense of a larger, more professional army and because a large home army was not politically welcome. The Prime Minister had to tell a surprised Queen Victoria that 'We have no army capable of meeting even a second-class Continental Power'.\nFirst phase: The Boer offensive, October\u2013December 1899.\nBritish Army deployed.\nWhen war with the Boers was imminent in September 1899, a Field Force, referred to as the Army Corps was mobilised and sent to Cape Town. It was \"about the equivalent of the I Army Corps of the existing mobilization scheme\" and was placed under the command of Gen Sir Redvers Buller, general officer commanding-in-chief of Aldershot Command. In South Africa the corps never operated as such and the 1st, 2nd, 3rd divisions were widely dispersed.\nBoer organization and skills.\nWar was declared on 11 October with a Boer offensive into the British-held Natal and Cape Colony areas. The Boers had about 33,000 soldiers, and outnumbered the British, who could move only 13,000 troops to the front line. The Boers had no problems with mobilisation, since the independent Boers had no regular army units, apart from the \"Staatsartillerie\" (Dutch for 'State Artillery'). As with the First Boer War, since most of the Boers were members of civilian militias, none had adopted uniforms or insignia. Only the members of the \"Staatsartillerie\" wore light green uniforms.\nWhen danger loomed, all the \"burgers\" (citizens) in a district would form a military unit called a \"commando\" and elect officers. A full-time official called a \"Veldkornet\" maintained muster rolls but had no disciplinary powers. Each man brought his own weapon, usually a hunting rifle, and horse. Those who could not afford a gun were given one by the authorities. The presidents of the Transvaal and Orange Free State simply signed decrees to concentrate within a week, and the commandos could muster between 30,000-40,000 men. Many did not look forward to fighting against fellow Christians and, by and large, fellow Protestants. Many had an overly optimistic sense of what the war would involve, imagining victory could be achieved as fast and easily as in the First Anglo-Boer War. Many, including many generals, had a sense their cause was holy and just, and blessed by God.\nIt rapidly became clear that the Boers presented the British forces with a severe tactical challenge. The Boers presented a mobile and innovative approach to warfare, drawing on their experiences from the First Boer War. The Boers who made up their commandos were farmers who had their working life in the saddle, as farmers and hunters. They depended on the pot, horse and rifle; they were skilled stalkers and marksmen. As hunters, they had learned to fire from cover; from a prone position and to make the first shot count, knowing that if they missed, the game would be long gone or could charge and potentially kill them. At community gatherings, target shooting was a major sport; they practised shooting at targets, such as hens' eggs perched on posts away. They made expert mounted infantry, using cover, from which they could pour in a destructive fire using modern, smokeless, Mauser rifles. In preparation for hostilities, the Boers had acquired around 100 of the latest Krupp field guns, all horse-drawn and dispersed among the Kommando groups and several Le Creusot \"Long Tom\" siege guns. The Boers' skill in adapting themselves to become first-rate artillerymen shows that they were a versatile adversary. The Transvaal had an intelligence service that stretched across South Africa and whose extent and efficiency the British were as yet unaware.\nBoers besiege Ladysmith, Mafeking and Kimberley.\nThe Boers struck first on 12 October at the Battle of Kraaipan, an attack that heralded the invasion of the Cape Colony and Natal between October 1899 and January 1900. With speed and surprise, the Boers drove quickly towards the British garrison at Ladysmith and the smaller ones at Mafeking and Kimberley. The quick Boer mobilisation resulted in military successes against scattered British forces. Sir George Stuart White, commanding the British division at Ladysmith, unwisely allowed Major-General Penn Symons to throw a brigade forward to the coal-mining town of Dundee (also reported as Glencoe), surrounded by hills. This became the war's first major clash, the Battle of Talana Hill. Boer guns began shelling the British camp from the summit of Talana Hill at dawn on 20 October. Penn Symons immediately counter-attacked: His infantry drove the Boers from the hill, for the loss of 446 British casualties, including Penn Symons.\nAnother Boer force occupied Elandslaagte, which lay between Ladysmith and Dundee. The British under Major General John French and Colonel Ian Hamilton attacked to clear the line of communications to Dundee. The resulting Battle of Elandslaagte was a clear-cut British tactical victory, but White feared more Boers were about to attack his main position and ordered a chaotic retreat from Elandslaagte, throwing away the advantage gained. The detachment from Dundee was compelled to make an exhausting cross-country retreat to rejoin White's main force. As Boers surrounded Ladysmith and opened fire with siege guns, White ordered a major sortie against them. The result was a disaster, with 140 men killed and over 1,000 captured. The siege of Ladysmith lasted months.\nMeanwhile, to the north-west at Mafeking, on the border with Transvaal, Colonel Robert Baden-Powell had raised two regiments of local forces amounting to about 1,200 men in order to attack and create diversions if things went wrong further south. As a railway junction, Mafeking provided good supply facilities and was the obvious place for Baden-Powell to fortify in readiness for such attacks. However, instead of being the aggressor, Baden-Powell was forced to defend Mafeking when 6,000 Boer, commanded by Piet Cronj\u00e9, attempted a determined assault. This quickly subsided into a desultory affair, with the Boers prepared to starve the stronghold into submission. So, on 13 October, the 217-day siege of Mafeking began.\nLastly, over to the south of Mafeking lay the diamond mining city of Kimberley, which was also subjected to a siege. Although not militarily significant, it represented an enclave of British imperialism on the borders of the Orange Free State and was hence an important Boer objective. In early November, about 7,500 Boer began their siege, again content to starve the town into submission. Despite Boer shelling, the 40,000 inhabitants, of which only 5,000 were armed, were under little threat, because the town was well-stocked with provisions. The garrison was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Robert Kekewich, although Rhodes was also a prominent figure in the town's defences.\nSiege life took its toll on the defending soldiers and civilians, as food began to grow scarce after a few weeks. In Mafeking, Sol Plaatje wrote, \"I saw horseflesh for the first time being treated as a human foodstuff.\" The cities also dealt with constant artillery bombardment, making the streets dangerous. Near the end of the siege of Kimberley, it was expected that the Boers would intensify their bombardment, so Rhodes displayed a notice encouraging people to go down into shafts of the Kimberley Mine for protection. The townspeople panicked, and people surged into the mineshafts constantly for a 12-hour period. Although the bombardment never came, this did nothing to diminish the anxious civilians' distress. The most well-heeled of the townspeople, including Rhodes, sheltered in the Sanatorium, site of the present-day McGregor Museum; the poorer residents, notably the black population, did not have any shelter from shelling.\nIn retrospect, the Boers' decision to commit themselves to sieges (\"Sitzkrieg\") was a mistake and an illustration of their lack of strategic vision. Of the seven sieges in the First Boer War, the Boers had prevailed in none. More importantly, it handed the initiative back to the British and allowed them to recover. Generally throughout the campaign, the Boers were too defensive and passive, wasting the opportunities they had for victory. Yet that passivity testified to the fact they had no desire to conquer British territory, but only to preserve their ability to rule in their own territory.\nFirst British relief attempts.\nOn 31 October 1899, General Sir Redvers Henry Buller, a much-respected commander, arrived in South Africa with the Army Corps, made up of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd divisions. Buller originally intended an offensive straight up the railway leading from Cape Town through Bloemfontein to Pretoria. Finding on arrival that British troops were under siege, he split his army corps into detachments to relieve the besieged garrisons. One division, led by Lieutenant General Lord Methuen, was to follow the Western Railway to the north and relieve Kimberley and Mafeking. A smaller force of 3,000, led by Major General William Gatacre, was to push north towards the railway junction at Stormberg and secure the Cape Midlands District from Boer raids and rebellions by Boer inhabitants. Buller led the major part of the army corps to relieve Ladysmith to the east.\nThe initial results of this offensive were mixed, with Methuen winning bloody skirmishes in the Battle of Belmont on 23 November, the Battle of Graspan on 25 November, and at a larger engagement, the Battle of Modder River, on 28 November resulting in British losses of 71 dead and over 400 wounded. British commanders had been trained on the lessons of the Crimean War and were adept at battalion and regimental set pieces, with columns manoeuvring in jungles, deserts and mountainous regions. What British generals failed to comprehend was the impact of destructive fire from trench positions and the mobility of cavalry raids. The British troops had antiquated tactics\u2014and in some cases antiquated weapons\u2014against the mobile Boer forces with the destructive fire of their modern Mausers, the latest Krupp field guns and their novel tactics. On 7 December, a raid at Enslin Station further highlighted British weaknesses, notably their supply line, which was vulnerable to guerilla attacks.\nThe middle of December was disastrous for the British. In a period known as Black Week (10\u201315 December 1899), the British suffered defeats on three fronts. On 10 December, General Gatacre tried to recapture Stormberg railway junction about south of the Orange River. Gatacre's attack was marked by administrative and tactical blunders and the Battle of Stormberg ended in a British defeat, with 135 killed and wounded and two guns and over 600 troops captured. At the Battle of Magersfontein on 11 December, Methuen's 14,000 British troops attempted to capture a Boer position in a dawn attack to relieve Kimberley. This too turned into a disaster when the Highland Brigade became pinned down by accurate Boer fire. After suffering from intense heat and thirst for nine hours, they eventually broke in ill-disciplined retreat. The Boer commanders, Koos de la Rey and Cronj\u00e9, had ordered trenches to be dug in an unconventional place to fool the British and give their riflemen a greater firing range. The plan worked, and this tactic helped to write the doctrine of the supremacy of the defensive position, using modern small arms and trench fortifications. The British lost 120 killed and 690 wounded and were prevented from relieving Kimberley and Mafeking. A British soldier said of the defeat:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Such was the day for our regimentDread the revenge we will take.Dearly we paid for the blunder \u2013A drawing-room General's mistake.Why weren't we told of the trenches?Why weren't we told of the wire? Why were we marched up in column,May Tommy Atkins enquire\u00a0...\u2014\u200a\nThe nadir of Black Week was the Second Battle of Colenso on 15 December, where 21,000 British troops, commanded by Buller, attempted to cross the Tugela River to relieve Ladysmith, where 8,000 Transvaal Boers under the command of Louis Botha were waiting. Through a combination of artillery and accurate rifle fire and better use of the ground, the Boers repelled British attempts to cross the river. After his first attacks failed, Buller broke off the battle and ordered a retreat, abandoning many wounded men, several isolated units and ten field guns to be captured by Botha's men. Buller's forces lost 145 men killed and 1,200 missing or wounded and the Boers suffered only 40 casualties, including 8 killed.\nSecond phase: British offensive, January-September 1900.\nThe British government took these defeats badly and with the sieges continuing was compelled to send two more divisions plus large numbers of colonial volunteers. By January 1900 this would become the largest force Britain had ever sent overseas, amounting to 180,000 men with further reinforcements being sought.\nWhile watching for these reinforcements, Buller made another bid to relieve Ladysmith by crossing the Tugela west of Colenso. Buller's subordinate, Major General Charles Warren, successfully crossed the river, but was faced with a fresh defensive position centred on a prominent hill known as Spion Kop. In the resulting Battle of Spion Kop, British troops captured the summit by surprise during the early hours of 24 January 1900, but as the fog lifted, they realised too late that they were overlooked by Boer gun emplacements on the surrounding hills. The rest of the day resulted in a disaster caused by poor communication between Buller and his commanders. Between them they issued contradictory orders, on the one hand ordering men off the hill, while other officers ordered fresh reinforcements to defend it. The result was 350 men killed and nearly 1,000 wounded and a retreat across the Tugela River into British territory. There were nearly 300 Boer casualties.\nBuller attacked Louis Botha again on 5 February at Vaal Krantz and was again defeated. Buller withdrew early when it appeared that the British would be isolated in an exposed bridgehead across the Tugela, for which he was nicknamed \"Sir Reverse\" by some of his officers.\nBuller replaced.\nBy taking command in person, Buller had allowed the overall direction of the war to drift. Because of concerns about his performance and negative reports from the field, he was replaced as Commander in Chief by Lord Roberts. Roberts assembled a new team for headquarters staff from far and wide: Lord Kitchener (Chief of Staff) from the Sudan; Frederick Russell Burnham (Chief of Scouts), the American scout, from the Klondike; George Henderson from the Staff College; Neville Bowles Chamberlain from Afghanistan; and William Nicholson (Military Secretary) from Calcutta. Like Buller, Roberts first intended to attack directly along the Cape Town\u2013Pretoria railway but, again like Buller, was forced to relieve the beleaguered garrisons. Leaving Buller in command in Natal, Roberts massed his main force near the Orange River and along the Western Railway behind Methuen's force at the Modder River and prepared to make a wide outflanking move to relieve Kimberley.\nExcept in Natal, the war had stagnated. Other than a single attempt to storm Ladysmith, the Boers made no attempt to capture the besieged towns. In the Cape Midlands, the Boers did not exploit the British defeat at Stormberg and were prevented from capturing the railway junction at Colesberg. In the dry summer, the grazing on the veld became parched, weakening the Boers' horses and draught oxen, and many Boer families joined their menfolk in the siege lines and \"laagers\" (encampments), fatally encumbering Cronj\u00e9's army.\nRoberts relieves the sieges.\nRoberts launched his main attack on 10 February 1900 and although hampered by a long supply route, managed to outflank the Boers defending Magersfontein. On 14 February, a cavalry division under French launched a major attack to relieve Kimberley. Although encountering severe fire, a massed cavalry charge split the Boer defences on 15 February, opening the way for French to enter Kimberley that evening, ending its 124 days' siege.\nMeanwhile, Roberts pursued Piet Cronj\u00e9's 7,000-strong force, which had abandoned Magersfontein to head for Bloemfontein. French's cavalry was ordered to assist in the pursuit by embarking on an epic drive towards Paardeberg where Cronj\u00e9 was attempting to cross the Modder River. At the Battle of Paardeberg from 18 to 27 February, Roberts then surrounded Cronj\u00e9's retreating Boer army. On 17 February, a pincer movement involving French's cavalry and the main British force attempted to take the entrenched position, but the frontal attacks were uncoordinated and so repulsed by the Boers. Finally, Roberts resorted to bombarding Cronj\u00e9 into submission. It took ten days, and when the British troops used the polluted Modder River as water supply, typhoid killed many troops. General Cronj\u00e9 was finally forced to surrender at the Battle of Paardeberg with 4,000 men.\nIn Natal, the Battle of the Tugela Heights, which started on 14 February was Buller's fourth attempt to relieve Ladysmith. The losses Buller's troops had sustained convinced Buller to adopt Boer tactics \"in the firing line\u2014to advance in small rushes, covered by rifle fire from behind; to use the tactical support of artillery; and above all, to use the ground, making rock and earth work for them as it did for the enemy.\" Despite reinforcements his progress was painfully slow against stiff opposition. However, on 26 February, after much deliberation, Buller used all his forces in one all-out attack for the first time and succeeded in forcing a crossing of the Tugela to defeat Botha's outnumbered forces north of Colenso. After a siege lasting 118 days, the Relief of Ladysmith was effected, the day after Cronj\u00e9 surrendered, but at a total cost of 7,000 British casualties. Buller's troops marched into Ladysmith on 28 February.\nAfter a succession of defeats, the Boers realised that against such overwhelming numbers of troops, they had little chance and became demoralised. Roberts then advanced into the Orange Free State from the west, putting the Boers to flight at the Battle of Poplar Grove and capturing Bloemfontein, the capital, unopposed on 13 March with the Boer defenders escaping and scattering. Meanwhile, he detached a small force to relieve Baden-Powell. The Relief of Mafeking on 18 May 1900 provoked riotous celebrations in Britain, the origin of the Edwardian slang word \"mafficking\". On 28 May, the Orange Free State was annexed and renamed the Orange River Colony.\nCapture of Pretoria.\nAfter being forced to delay for several weeks at Bloemfontein by a shortage of supplies, an outbreak of typhoid at Paardeberg, and poor medical care, Roberts finally resumed his advance. He was forced to halt again at Kroonstad for 10 days, due once again to the collapse of his medical and supply systems, but captured Johannesburg on 31 May and the capital of the Transvaal, Pretoria, on 5 June. Before the war, the Boers had constructed forts south of Pretoria, but the artillery had been removed from the forts for use in the field, and in the event they abandoned Pretoria without a fight. Having won the principal cities, Roberts declared the war over on 3 September 1900; and the South African Republic was formally annexed.\nBritish observers believed the war to be all but over after the capture of the two capitals. However, the Boers had earlier met at the temporary new capital of the Orange Free State, Kroonstad, and planned a guerrilla campaign to hit the British supply and communication lines. The first engagement of this new form of warfare was at Sanna's Post on 31 March where 1,500 Boers under the command of Christiaan de Wet attacked Bloemfontein's waterworks about east of the city, and ambushed a heavily escorted convoy, which caused 155 British casualties and the capture of seven guns, 117 wagons, and 428 British troops.\nAfter the fall of Pretoria, one of the last formal battles was at Diamond Hill on 11\u201312 June, where Roberts attempted to drive the remnants of the Boer field army under Botha beyond striking distance of Pretoria. Although Roberts drove the Boers from the hill, Botha did not regard it as a defeat, for he inflicted 162 casualties on the British while suffering only around 50 casualties.\nBoers retreat.\nThe set-piece period of the war now largely gave way to a guerrilla war, but one final operation remained. President Kruger and what remained of the Transvaal government had retreated to eastern Transvaal. Roberts, joined by troops from Natal under Buller, advanced against them, and broke their last defensive position at Bergendal on 26 August. As Roberts and Buller followed up along the railway line to Komatipoort, Kruger sought asylum in Portuguese East Africa (modern Mozambique). Some dispirited Boers did likewise, and the British gathered up much war material. However, the core of the Boer fighters under Botha easily broke back through the Drakensberg Mountains into the Transvaal highveld after riding north through the bushveld.\nAs Roberts's army occupied Pretoria, the Boer fighters in the Orange Free State retreated into the Brandwater Basin, a fertile area in the south-east of the Republic. This offered only temporary sanctuary, as the mountain passes leading to it could be occupied by the British, trapping the Boers. A force under General Archibald Hunter set out from Bloemfontein to achieve this in July 1900. The hard core of the Free State Boers under De Wet, accompanied by President Steyn, left the basin early. Those remaining fell into confusion and most failed to break out before Hunter trapped them. 4,500 Boers surrendered and much equipment was captured, but as with Roberts's drive against Kruger, these losses were of relatively little consequence, as the hard core of the Boer armies and their most determined and active leaders remained at large.\nFrom the Basin, Christiaan de Wet headed west. Although hounded by British columns, he succeeded in crossing the Vaal into western Transvaal, to allow Steyn to travel to meet their leaders. There was much sympathy for the Boers in Europe. In October, President Kruger and members of the Transvaal government left Portuguese East Africa on the Dutch warship \"De Gelderland\", sent by the Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands. Paul Kruger's wife, however, was too ill to travel and remained in South Africa where she died on 20 July 1901 without seeing her husband again. President Kruger first went to Marseille and then to the Netherlands, where he stayed before moving to Clarens, Switzerland, where he died in exile in 1904.\nPrisoners of war sent overseas.\nThe first sizeable batch of Boer prisoners taken by the British consisted of those captured at the Battle of Elandslaagte on 21 October 1899. Initially, these POWs were held on troopships in Simons Bay until POW camps in Cape Town and Simonstown were completed. In total, six prisoner of war camps would be set up in South Africa. As numbers grew, the British decided they did not want them kept locally. The capture of 4000 POWs in February 1900 was a key event, which made the British realise they could not accommodate all POWs in South Africa. The British feared they could be freed by sympathetic locals. Moreover, they already had trouble supplying their troops and did not want the added burden of sending supplies for the POWs. Britain therefore sent many POWs overseas.\nAround 31 prisoner of war camps were consequently set up in British colonies overseas during the war. The first overseas (off African mainland) camps were opened in Saint Helena, which ultimately received about 5,000 POWs. About 5,000 POWs were sent to Ceylon. Other POWs were sent to Bermuda and India.\nOath of neutrality.\nOn 15 March 1900, Lord Roberts proclaimed an amnesty for all burghers, except leaders, who took an oath of neutrality and returned quietly to their homes. It is estimated that between 12,000 and 14,000 burghers took this oath between March and June 1900.\nThird phase: Guerrilla war, September 1900\u2013May 1902).\nBy September 1900, the British were nominally in control of both Republics, with the exception of north Transvaal. However, they discovered they only controlled the territory their columns physically occupied. Despite the loss of their capitals and half their army, the Boer commanders adopted guerrilla warfare, conducting raids against railways, resource and supply targets, aimed at disrupting the operational capacity of the British Army. They avoided pitched battles and casualties were light.\nBoer commando units were sent to the district from which its members were recruited, which meant they could rely on local support and knowledge of the terrain and towns, enabling them to live off the land. Their orders were simply to act against the British whenever possible. Their tactics were to strike fast causing as much damage as possible, then withdraw before enemy reinforcements could arrive. The vast distances of the republics allowed Boer commandos freedom to move about and made it nearly impossible for the 250,000 British troops to control the territory effectively using columns alone. As soon as a British column left a town or district, British control of that area faded away. Boer commandos were especially effective during the initial guerrilla phase because Roberts had assumed the war would end with the capture of the capitals and dispersal of the Boer armies. British troops were therefore redeployed out of the area, and had been replaced by lower-quality Imperial Yeomanry and locally-raised irregular corps.\nFrom late May 1900, the first successes of the Boer guerrilla strategy were at Lindley (where 500 Yeomanry surrendered), and at Heilbron (where a large convoy and its escort were captured) and other skirmishes resulting in 1,500 British casualties in less than ten days. In December 1900, De la Rey and Christiaan Beyers attacked and mauled a British brigade at Nooitgedacht, inflicting 650 casualties. As a result, the British, led by Lord Kitchener, mounted extensive searches for Christiaan de Wet, but without success. However, Boer raids on British army camps and other targets were sporadic and poorly planned, and the nature of the Boer guerrilla war itself had no long-term objectives, with the exception to harass the British. This led to a disorganised pattern of scattered engagements between the British and Boers.\nUse of blockhouses.\nThe British were forced to revise their tactics. They concentrated on restricting the freedom of movement of the Boer commandos and depriving them of local support. The railway lines had provided vital lines of communication and supply, and as the British had advanced across South Africa, they had used armoured trains and established fortified blockhouses at key points along most lines. They built additional blockhouses (each housing between six to eight soldiers under a non-commissioned officer) at bridges and beside major roads connecting rural towns, and fortified these to protect supply routes against Boer raiders. Eventually over 8,000 such blockhouses were built across the republics, radiating from the larger towns along principal roads and railways. Each blockhouse cost \u00a3800-\u00a31,000 and took three months to build. Despite this, they proved effective; not one bridge or any section of railway line at which a blockhouse was manned was blown up.\nThe blockhouse system required many troops to garrison. Well over 50,000 British troops, or 50 battalions, were involved in blockhouse duty, greater than the approximately 30,000 Boers in the field during the guerrilla phase. In addition, up to 16,000 local Africans were used as armed guards and to patrol the line at night. The Army linked the blockhouses with barbed wire fences to parcel up the wide veld into smaller areas. \"New Model\" drives were mounted under which a line of troops could sweep an area of veld bounded by blockhouse lines, unlike the earlier inefficient scouring of the countryside by scattered columns.\nScorched earth campaign against civilians.\nThe British implemented a scorched earth policy under which they targeted everything within the controlled areas that could give sustenance to the guerrillas, making it harder for them to survive. As British troops swept the countryside, they systematically destroyed crops, poisoned wells, burned homesteads and farms, and interned Boer and African men, women, children and workers in concentration camps. The British established mounted raiding columns in support of sweeper columns. These were used to rapidly follow and relentlessly harass the Boers to delay them and cut off escape, while the sweeper units caught up. Many of the 90 or so mobile columns formed by the British to participate in such drives were a mixture of British and colonial troops, but they also had a large minority of armed Africans. The number of armed Africans serving with these columns has been estimated at 20,000. The British Army made use of Boer auxiliaries who had been persuaded to change sides and enlist as \"National Scouts\". Serving under General Andries Cronj\u00e9 (1849\u20131923), the National Scouts were despised as \"joiners\" but numbered a fifth of the fighting Afrikaners by the end of the War.\nThe British utilised armoured trains to deliver rapid reaction forces much more quickly to incidents (such as Boer attacks on blockhouses and columns) or drop them off ahead of retreating Boer columns.\nPeace committees.\nAmong those Burghers who had stopped fighting, it was decided to form peace committees to persuade those fighting to desist. In December 1900, Lord Kitchener gave permission that a central Burgher Peace Committee be inaugurated in Pretoria. By the end of 1900 thirty envoys were sent out to the districts to form peace committees to persuade burghers to give up. Previous leaders of the Boers, like Generals Piet de Wet and Andries Cronj\u00e9 were involved in the organisation. Meyer de Kock was an emissary of a peace committee, but he was arrested, convicted of high treason, and executed by firing squad.\nJoiners.\nSome burghers joined the British in their fight against the Boers. By the end of hostilities in May 1902, there were 5,464 burghers working for the British.\nOrange Free State.\nAfter having conferred with the Transvaal leaders, de Wet returned to the Orange Free State, where he inspired successful attacks and raids in the western part of the country, though he suffered a defeat at Bothaville in November 1900. Many Boers who had returned to their farms and towns, sometimes after being given parole by the British, took up arms again. In late January 1901, De Wet led a renewed invasion of Cape Colony. This was less successful, because there was no general uprising among the Cape Boers, and De Wet's men were hampered by bad weather and pursued by British forces. They narrowly escaped across the Orange River.\nFrom then until the final days of the war, De Wet remained comparatively quiet, rarely attacking British army camps and columns partly because the Orange Free State was effectively left desolate by British sweeps. In December 1901, De Wet attacked and overran an isolated British detachment at Groenkop, inflicting heavy casualties and capturing over 200 British soldiers. This prompted Kitchener to launch the first of the \"New Model\" drives against him. De Wet escaped the first such drive but lost 300 fighters. This was a severe loss, and a portent of further attrition, although sweep attempts to round up De Wet were badly handled, and De Wet's forces avoided capture.\nWestern Transvaal.\nThe Boer commandos in the Western Transvaal were very active after September 1901. Several battles were fought there between September 1901 and March 1902. At Moedwil on 30 September 1901 and again at Driefontein on 24 October, General Koos De La Rey's forces attacked British camps and outposts but were forced to withdraw after the British offered strong resistance.\nFrom late 1901 to early 1902, a time of relative quiet descended on the western Transvaal. February 1902 saw the next major battle in that region. On 25 February, De La Rey attacked a British column under Lieutenant-Colonel S. B. von Donop at Ysterspruit near Wolmaransstad. De La Rey succeeded in capturing many men and ammunition. The Boer attacks prompted Lord Methuen, the British second-in-command after Kitchener, to move his column from Vryburg to Klerksdorp to deal with De La Rey. On the morning of 7 March 1902, the Boers attacked the rear guard of Methuen's moving column at Tweebosch. Confusion reigned in British ranks and Methuen was wounded and captured by the Boers.\nThe Boer victories in the west led to stronger action by the British. In the second half of March 1902, British reinforcements were sent to the Western Transvaal under the direction of Ian Hamilton. The opportunity the British were waiting for arose on 11 April 1902 at Rooiwal, where a commando led by General Jan Kemp and Commandant Potgieter attacked a superior force under Kekewich. The British soldiers were well positioned on the hillside and inflicted casualties on the Boers charging on horseback over a large distance, beating them back. This was the end of the war in the Western Transvaal and the last major battle of the war.\nEastern Transvaal.\nTwo Boer forces fought in this area, under Botha in the south east and under Ben Viljoen in the north east around Lydenburg. Botha's forces were particularly active, raiding railways and British supply convoys, and mounting a renewed invasion of Natal in September 1901. After defeating British mounted infantry in the Battle of Blood River Poort near Dundee, Botha was forced to withdraw by heavy rain that made movement difficult and crippled his horses. Back on the Transvaal territory around his home district of Vryheid, Botha attacked a British raiding column at Bakenlaagte, using an effective mounted charge. One of the most active British units was effectively destroyed. This made Botha's forces the target of increasingly large scorched earth drives by British forces, in which the British made particular use of native scouts and informers. Eventually, Botha had to abandon the high veld and retreat to a narrow enclave bordering Swaziland.\nTo the north, Ben Viljoen grew steadily less active. His forces mounted comparatively few attacks and as a result, the Boer enclave around Lydenburg was largely unmolested. Viljoen was eventually captured.\nCape Colony.\nIn parts of Cape Colony, particularly the Cape Midlands District where Boers formed a majority of the white inhabitants, the British had always feared a general uprising against them. In fact, no such uprising took place, even in the early days of the war when Boer armies had advanced across the Orange. The cautious conduct of some elderly Orange Free State generals had been one factor that discouraged the Cape Boers from siding with the Boer republics. Nevertheless, there was widespread pro-Boer sympathy. Some Cape Dutch volunteered to help the British, but a larger number volunteered to help the other side. Politics was more important than the military factor: the Cape Dutch, according to Milner 90 percent of whom favoured the rebels, controlled the provincial legislature, and its authorities forbade the British Army to burn farms or to force Boer civilians into concentration camps. The British had more limited options to suppress the insurgency in the Cape Colony as result.\nAfter he escaped across the Orange in March 1901, de Wet had left forces under Cape rebels Kritzinger and Gideon Scheepers to maintain a guerrilla campaign in the Cape Midlands. The campaign here was one of the least chivalrous of the war, with intimidation by both sides of each other's civilian sympathisers. In one of many skirmishes, Commandant Johannes L\u00f6tter's small commando was tracked down by a much-superior British column and wiped out at Groenkloof. Several captured Boers, including Lotter and Scheepers, who was captured when he fell ill with appendicitis, were executed by the British for treason or for capital crimes such as the murder of British prisoners or unarmed civilians. Some of the executions took place in public, to deter further disaffection.\nFresh Boer forces under Jan Christiaan Smuts, joined by the surviving rebels under Kritzinger, made another attack on the Cape in September 1901. They suffered severe hardships and were hard pressed by British columns, but eventually rescued themselves by routing some of their pursuers at the Battle of Elands River and capturing their equipment. From then until the end of the war, Smuts increased his forces from among Cape rebels until they numbered 3,000. However, no general uprising took place, and the situation in the Cape remained stalemated.\nIn January 1902, Boer leader Manie Maritz was implicated in the Leliefontein massacre in the far Northern Cape.\nBoer foreign volunteers.\nWhile no other government actively supported the Boer cause, individuals from several countries volunteered and formed Foreign Volunteer Units. These primarily came from Europe, particularly the Netherlands, Germany and Sweden-Norway. Other countries such as France, Italy, Ireland (then part of the United Kingdom), and restive areas of the Russian Empire, including Congress Poland and Georgia, also formed smaller volunteer corps. Finns fought in the Scandinavian Corps. Two volunteers, George Henri Anne-Marie Victor de Villebois-Mareuil of France and Yevgeny Maximov of Russia, became \"veggeneraals\" (fighting generals) of the South African Republic.\nConclusion.\nIn early 1902, British tactics of containment, denial, and harassment finally began to yield results against the guerrillas. The sourcing and co-ordination of intelligence became increasingly efficient with regular reporting from observers in the blockhouses, from units patrolling the fences and conducting \"sweeper\" operations, and from native Africans in rural areas who increasingly supplied intelligence, as the Scorched Earth policy took effect and they found themselves competing with the Boers for food supplies. Kitchener's forces at last began to affect the Boers' fighting strength and freedom of manoeuvre, and made it harder for the Boers and their families to survive. Despite this success, almost half the Boer fighting strength, around 15,000 men, were still in the field fighting by May 1902. However, Kitchener's tactics were costly: Britain was running out of time, patience, and money needed for the war.\nThe British offered terms of peace on various occasions, notably in March 1901, but were rejected by Botha and the \"Bitter-enders\" among the Boers, who pledged to fight until the bitter end and rejected the demand for compromise made by the \"Hands-uppers\". Their reasons included hatred of the British, loyalty to their dead comrades, solidarity with fellow commandos, a desire for independence, religious arguments, and fear of captivity or punishment. On the other hand, their women and children were dying in prison camps and independence seemed more and more impossible.\nThe last of the Boers finally surrendered in May 1902 and the war ended with the Treaty of Vereeniging signed on 31 May 1902. After a period of obstinacy, the British offered the Boers generous terms of conditional surrender in order to bring the war to a conclusion. The Boers were given \u00a33,000,000 for reconstruction and promised eventual limited self-government, which was granted in 1906 and 1907. The treaty ended the existence of the Transvaal and Orange Free State as independent Boer republics and placed them within the British Empire. The Union of South Africa was established as a dominion of the British Empire in 1910.\nNonwhite roles.\nThe policy on both sides was to minimise the role of nonwhites, but the need for manpower continuously stretched those resolves. At the battle of Spion Kop in Ladysmith, Mohandas K. Gandhi with 300 free burgher Indians and 800 indentured Indian labourers started the Ambulance Corps serving the British side. As the war raged across African farms and their homes were destroyed, many became refugees and they, like the Boers, moved to the towns where the British hastily created internment camps. Subsequently, the British scorched earth policies were applied to both Boers and Africans. Although most black Africans were not considered by the British to be hostile, many tens of thousands were also forcibly removed from Boer areas and also placed in concentration camps. Africans were held separately from Boer internees. Eventually there were a total of 64 tented camps for Africans. Conditions were as bad as in the camps for the Boers, but even though, after the Fawcett Commission report, conditions improved in the Boer camps, \"improvements were much slower in coming to the black camps\"; 20,000 died there.\nThe Boers and the British both feared the consequences of arming Africans. The memories of the Zulu and other tribal conflicts were still fresh, and they recognised that whoever won would have to deal with the consequences of a mass militarisation of the tribes. There was therefore an unwritten agreement that this war would be a \"white man's war.\" At the outset, British officials instructed all white magistrates in the Natal Colony to appeal to Zulu amakhosi (chiefs) to remain neutral, and President Kruger sent emissaries asking them to stay out of it. However, in some cases there were old scores to be settled, and some Africans, such as the Swazis, were eager to enter the war with the specific aim of reclaiming land won by the Boers. As the war went on there was greater involvement of Africans, and in particular large numbers became embroiled in the conflict on the British side, either voluntarily or involuntarily. By the end of the war, many Africans had been armed and had shown conspicuous gallantry in roles such as scouts, messengers, watchmen in blockhouses, and auxiliaries.\nAnd there were more flash points outside of the war. On 6 May 1902 at Holkrantz in the southeastern Transvaal, a Zulu faction had their cattle stolen and their women and children tortured by the Boers as a punishment for assisting the British. The local Boer officer then sent an insulting message to the tribe, challenging them to take back their cattle. The Zulus attacked at night, and in a mutual bloodbath, the Boers lost 56 killed and 3 wounded, while the Africans suffered 52 killed and 48 wounded.\nAbout 10,000 black men were attached to Boer units where they performed camp duties; a handful unofficially fought in combat. The British Army employed over 14,000 Africans as wagon drivers. Even more had combatant roles as spies, guides, and eventually as soldiers. By 1902 there were about 30,000 armed Africans in the British Army. Sol Plaatje was the only black person to keep a diary during the war, which later proved to be a valuable source about the black participation in the war.\nConcentration camps.\nThe term \"concentration camp\" was used to describe camps operated by the British in South Africa during this conflict in the years 1900\u201302, and the term grew in prominence during this period.\nThe camps had originally been set up by the British Army as \"refugee camps\" to provide refuge for civilian families who had been forced to abandon their homes for whatever reason related to the war. However, when Kitchener took over in late 1900, he introduced new tactics in an attempt to break the guerrilla campaign and the influx of civilians grew dramatically as a result. Disease and starvation killed thousands. Kitchener initiated plans to\n... flush out guerrillas in a series of systematic drives, organised like a sporting shoot, with success defined in a weekly 'bag' of killed, captured and wounded, and to sweep the country bare of everything that could give sustenance to the guerrillas, including women and children\u00a0... It was the clearance of civilians\u2014uprooting a whole nation\u2014that would come to dominate the last phase of the war. \u2014\u200aPakenham\nAs Boer farms were destroyed by the British under their \"Scorched Earth\" policy\u2014including the systematic destruction of crops and slaughtering of livestock, the burning down of homesteads and farms\u2014to prevent the Boers from resupplying from a home base, many tens of thousands of women and children were forcibly moved into the concentration camps. This was not the first appearance of internment camps, as the Spanish had used internment in Cuba in the Ten Years' War, and the Americans in the Philippine\u2013American War, but the Boer War concentration camp system was the first time that a whole nation had been systematically targeted, and the first in which whole regions had been depopulated.\nEventually, there were a total of 45 tented camps built for Boer internees and 64 for black Africans. Of the 28,000 Boer men captured as prisoners of war, 25,630 were sent overseas to prisoner-of-war camps throughout the British Empire. The vast majority of Boers remaining in the local camps were women and children. Around 26,370 Boer women and children were to perish in these concentration camps. Of the more than 120,000 Blacks (and Coloureds) imprisoned too, around 20,000 died.\nThe camps were poorly administered from the outset and became increasingly overcrowded when Kitchener's troops implemented the internment strategy on a vast scale. Conditions were terrible for the health of the internees, mainly due to neglect, poor hygiene and bad sanitation. The supply of all items was unreliable, partly because of the constant disruption of communication lines by the Boers. The food rations were meagre and there was a two-tier allocation policy, whereby families of men who were still fighting were routinely given smaller rations than others. The inadequate shelter, poor diet, bad hygiene and overcrowding led to malnutrition and endemic contagious diseases such as measles, typhoid, and dysentery, to which the children were particularly vulnerable. Coupled with a shortage of modern medical facilities, many of the internees died. While much of the British press, including \"The Times\", played down the problems in the camps, Emily Hobhouse helped raise public awareness in Britain of the atrocious conditions, as well as being instrumental in bringing relief to the concentration camps.\nWar crimes trial.\nThe Boer War saw the first war crimes prosecutions in British history. They centered around the Bushveldt Carbineers (BVC), a British Army irregular regiment of mounted rifles active in the Northern Transvaal. Originally raised in February 1901, the BVC was composed of British and Commonwealth servicemen with an admixture of defectors from the Boer Commandos. On 4 October 1901, a letter signed by 15 members of the Bushveldt Carbineers (BVC) garrison at Fort Edward was secretly dispatched to Col. F.H. Hall, the British Army Officer Commanding at Pietersburg. Written by BVC Trooper Robert Mitchell Cochrane, a former justice of the peace from Western Australia, the letter accused members of the Fort Edward garrison of six \"disgraceful incidents\":\nThe letter then accused Field Commander of the BVC, Major Robert William Lenehan, of being \"privy to these misdeamenours. It is for this reason that we have taken the liberty of addressing this communication direct to you.\" After listing civilian witnesses who could confirm their allegations, Trooper Cochrane concluded, \"Sir, many of us are Australians who have fought throughout nearly the whole war while others are Africaners who have fought from Colenso till now. We cannot return home with the stigma of these crimes attached to our names. Therefore we humbly pray that a full and exhaustive inquiry be made by Imperial officers in order that the truth be elicited and justice done. Also we beg that all witnesses may be kept in camp at Pietersburg till the inquiry is finished. So deeply do we deplore the opprobrium which must be inseparably attached to these crimes that scarcely a man once his time is up can be prevailed to re-enlist in this corps. Trusting for the credit of thinking you will grant the inquiry we seek.\" In response to the letter, Col. Hall summoned all Fort Edward officers to Pietersburg on 21 October. All were met by mounted infantry five miles outside Pietersburg on the morning of 23 October and \"brought into town like criminals\". Lt. Morant was arrested after returning from leave in Pretoria, where he had gone to settle the affairs of his deceased friend Captain Hunt.\nAlthough the trial transcripts, like most others between 1850-1914, were later destroyed by the Civil Service, it is known that a Court of Inquiry, the British military's equivalent to a grand jury, was convened on 16 October. The President of the Court was Col. H.M. Carter, who was assisted by Captain E. Evans and Major Wilfred N. Bolton, the Provost Marshal of Pietersburg. Its first session took place on 6 November and continued for four weeks. Deliberations continued for a further two weeks, at which time it became clear the indictments would be as follows:\nFollowing the indictments, Maj. R. Whigham and Col. James St. Clair ordered Bolton to appear for the prosecution, as he was less expensive than a barrister. Bolton vainly requested to be excused, writing, \"My knowledge of law is insufficient for so intricate a matter.\" The first court martial opened on 16 January 1902, with Lieut.-Col. H.C. Denny presiding over a panel of six judges. Maj. J.F. Thomas, a solicitor from Tenterfield, New South Wales, had been retained to defend Maj. Lenahan. The night before, however, he agreed to represent all six defendants. The \"Visser Incident\" was the first case to go to trial. Lt. Morant's former orderly and interpreter, BVC Trooper Theunis J. Botha, testified that Visser, who had been promised his life would be spared, was cooperative during two days of interrogation and his information was found to have been true. Despite this, Morant ordered him shot. In response, Morant testified that he only followed orders to take no prisoners as relayed to the late Captain Hunt by Col. Hubert Hamilton. He alleged that Visser was captured wearing a British Army jacket and that Hunt's body had been mutilated. In response, the court moved to Pretoria, where Col. Hamilton testified that he had \"never spoken to Captain Hunt with reference to his duties in the Northern Transvaal\". Though stunned, Maj. Thomas argued that his clients were not guilty because they believed that they \"acted under orders\". In response, Bolton argued that they were \"illegal orders\" and said, \"The right of killing an armed man exists only so long as he resists; as soon as he submits he is entitled to be treated as a prisoner of war.\" The Court ruled in Bolton's favor. Morant was found guilty of murder. Handcock, Witton, and Picton were convicted of the lesser charge of manslaughter.\nOn 27 February Morant and Handcock were executed by firing squad after being convicted of murdering eight Afrikaner POWs. This court-martial for war crimes was one of the first such prosecutions in British history. Although Morant left a confession in his cell, he went on to become a folk hero in modern Australia. Believed by many Australians to be the victim of a kangaroo court, appeals have been made for Morant to be retried or pardoned. His court-martial and death have been the subject of books, a stage play, and Australian New Wave film adaptation. Witton was sentenced to death, but reprieved. Due to immense political pressure, he was released after serving 32 months of a life sentence. Picton was cashiered.\nImperial involvement.\nMost troops fighting for the British army came from Britain, and a significant number came from other parts of its Empire. These countries had internal disputes over whether they should remain tied to London, or have independence, which carried over into the debate around sending forces to assist the war. Though not independent on foreign affairs, these countries did have local say over how much support to provide, and how it was provided. Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Rhodesia all sent volunteers to aid the UK. Troops were also raised to fight with the British from the Cape Colony and Natal. Some Boer fighters, such as Smuts and Botha, were British subjects as they came from the Cape Colony and Colony of Natal, respectively.\nThere were many volunteers from the Empire who were not selected for the official contingents and travelled privately to form private units, such as the Canadian Scouts and Doyle's Australian Scouts. There were European volunteer units from British India and British Ceylon, though the British refused offers of non-white troops from the Empire. Some Cape Coloureds volunteered early in the war, but later some were effectively conscripted and kept in segregated units. As a community, they received little reward for their services. The war set the pattern for the Empire's involvement in the two World Wars. Specially raised units, consisting of volunteers, were dispatched overseas to serve with forces from elsewhere in the Empire.\nAustralia.\nFrom 1899 to 1901 the six separate self-governing colonies in Australia sent contingents to serve in the war. That much of the population had originated from Britain explains a desire to support it. After the colonies formed the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901, the new Government of Australia sent \"Commonwealth\" contingents to the war. The Boer War was thus the first war in which the Commonwealth of Australia fought. A few Australians fought on the Boer side. The most famous and colourful character was Colonel Arthur Alfred Lynch, formerly of Ballarat, Victoria, who raised the Second Irish Brigade.\nThe Australian climate and geography were far closer to that of South Africa than most other parts of the empire, so Australians adapted quickly, with troops serving mostly among the army's \"mounted rifles\". Enlistment in official Australian contingents totalled 16,463. Another five to seven thousand Australians served in \"irregular\" regiments raised in South Africa. Perhaps 500 Australian irregulars were killed. In total about 20,000 Australians served and about 1,000 were killed. 267 died from disease, 251 were killed in action or from wounds sustained in battle; 43 men were reported missing.\nWhen the war began some Australians, like some Britons, opposed it. As the war dragged on some Australians became disenchanted, in part because of the sufferings of Boer civilians reported in the press. When the British missed capturing President Paul Kruger, as he escaped Pretoria during its fall in June 1900, a \"Melbourne Punch\" cartoon depicted how the War could be won, using the Kelly Gang.\nThe convictions and executions of two Australian lieutenants, Harry Harbord Morant and Peter Handcock in 1902, and the imprisonment of a third, George Witton, had minimal impact on the Australian public at the time. The controversial court-martial saw the three convicted of executing prisoners under their authority. After the war though, Australians joined an empire-wide campaign that saw Witton released from jail. Much later, some Australians came to see the execution of Morant and Handcock as instances of wrongfully executed Australians, as illustrated in the 1980 Australian film \"Breaker Morant\".\nUp to 50 Aboriginal Australians served in the Boer War as trackers. Such is the lack of information available it is even uncertain as to whether they returned to Australia after the war. When the Australian contingents returned the trackers may not have been allowed back to Australia due to the White Australia Policy.\nCanada.\nAround 8,000 Canadians arrived in South Africa to fight for Britain. These arrived in contingents: the first on 30 October 1899, the second on 21 January 1900. A third contingent of cavalry (Strathcona's Horse) embarked on 16/17 March 1900. They remained until May 1902. With approximately 7,368 soldiers and 12 nurses in a combat zone, the conflict became the largest engagement involving Canadian soldiers from the time of Confederation until the Great War. It was also the first time since the Mahdist War that Canadians had been deployed overseas. 270 Canadian soldiers died during the war.\nThe arrival and movement of troops was widely documented by war photographers. English-born, and later Canadian, Inglis Sheldon-Williams was one of the most notable, documenting movement of hundreds of troops to Africa.\nThe Canadian public was initially divided on the decision to go to war, as some did not want Canada to become Britain's 'tool' for engaging in armed conflicts. Many Anglophone citizens were pro-Empire, and wanted prime minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier to support the British. Many Francophone citizens felt threatened by the continuation of British imperialism to their national sovereignty. In the end, to appease citizens who wanted war and avoid angering those against it, Laurier sent 1,000 volunteers under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William Otter to aid the confederation in its war to 'liberate' the peoples of the Boer controlled states in South Africa. The volunteers were provided to the British if the latter paid costs of the battalion after it arrived in South Africa.\nThe supporters of the war claimed that it \"pitted British Freedom, justice and civilization against Boer backwardness\". The French Canadians' opposition to the Canadian involvement in a British 'colonial venture' eventually led to a three-day riot in Quebec. Many Canadian soldiers did not actually see combat since many arrived around the time of the signing of the Treaty of Vereeniging on 31 May 1902.\nIndia.\nBritish garrisons in India contributed 18,534 British officers and men, as well as an estimated 10,000 Indian auxiliaries deployed to assist them. India also sent 7,000 horses, ponies and mules. Indian auxiliaries were only employed in non-combatant roles.\nThe Natal Indian Ambulance Corps, created by Gandhi and financed by the local Indian community, served at the battles of Colenso and Spion Kop.\nNew Zealand.\nWhen war seemed imminent, New Zealand offered its support. On 28 September 1899, Prime Minister Richard Seddon asked Parliament to approve the offer to the imperial government of a contingent of mounted rifles, thus becoming the first British Colony to send troops to the war. The British position in the dispute with the Transvaal was \"moderate and righteous\", he maintained. He stressed the \"crimson tie\" of Empire that bound New Zealand to the mother-country and the importance of a strong British Empire for the colony's security.\n10 contingents of volunteers, totalling nearly 6,500 men from New Zealand, with 8,000 horses fought in the conflict, along with doctors, nurses, veterinary surgeons and school teachers. 70 New Zealanders died from enemy action, with another 158 killed accidentally or by disease. The first New Zealander killed was Farrier Bradford at Jasfontein Farm on 18 December 1899. The war was greeted with enthusiasm when the war was over, and peace greeted with patriotism and national pride. This is best shown by the fact that the Third, Fourth and Fifth contingents from New Zealand were funded by public conscription.\nRhodesia.\nRhodesian military units such as the British South Africa Police, Rhodesia Regiment and Southern Rhodesian Volunteers served in the war.\nSouth Africa.\nDuring the war, the British army included substantial contingents from South Africa itself. There were large communities of English-speaking immigrants and settlers in Natal and Cape Colony, which formed volunteer units that took the field, or local \"town guards\". At one stage of the war, a \"Colonial Division\", consisting of five light horse and infantry units under Brigadier General Edward Brabant, took part in the invasion of the Orange Free State. Part of it withstood a siege by Christiaan de Wet at Wepener on the borders of Basutoland. Another large source of volunteers was the \"uitlander\" community, many of whom hastily left Johannesburg in the days immediately preceding the war.\nLater during the war, Kitchener attempted to form a Boer Police Force, as part of his efforts to pacify the occupied areas and effect a reconciliation with the Boer community. The members of this force were despised as traitors by the Boers still in the field. Boers who attempted to remain neutral after giving their parole to British forces were derided as \"hensoppers\" (hands-uppers) and often coerced into giving support to the Boer guerrillas (which was one reason for British scorched earth campaigns throughout the countryside and detention of Boers in concentration camps, to deny anything of use to the guerrillas).\nLike the Canadian, and particularly the Australian and New Zealand contingents, many volunteer units formed by South Africans were \"light horse\" or mounted infantry, well-suited to the countryside and manner of warfare. Some regular British officers scorned their comparative lack of formal discipline, but the light horse units were hardier and more suited to campaigning than the overloaded British cavalry, who were still obsessed with the charge by lance or sabre. At their peak, 24,000 South Africans served in the field in \"colonial\" units. Notable units (in addition to the Imperial Light Horse) were the South African Light Horse, Rimington's Guides, Kitchener's Horse and the Imperial Light Infantry.\nOther nations.\nThe United States of America stayed neutral, but some Americans were eager to participate. Early in the war Lord Roberts cabled Major Frederick Russell Burnham, a veteran of both Matabele wars but then prospecting in the Klondike, to serve on his personal staff as Chief of Scouts. Burnham went on to receive the highest awards of any American who served in the war. American mercenaries participated on both sides.\nAftermath and analysis.\nThe war cast long shadows over the history of the South African region. The predominantly agrarian society of the former Boer republics was profoundly and fundamentally affected by the scorched earth policy. The devastation of Boer and black African populations in the concentration camps and through war and exile, were to have a lasting effect on the demography and quality of life in the region.\nMany exiles and prisoners were unable to return to their farms; others attempted to but were forced to abandon them as unworkable given the damage caused by farm burning during the scorched earth policy. Destitute Boers and black Africans swelled the ranks of the unskilled urban poor competing with the \"uitlanders\" in the mines.\nThe postwar reconstruction administration was presided over by Lord Milner and his Oxford-educated Milner's Kindergarten. This group of civil servants had a profound effect on the region, eventually leading to the Union of South Africa:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In the aftermath of the war, an imperial administration freed from accountability to a domestic electorate set about reconstructing an economy that was by then predicated unambiguously on gold. At the same time, British civil servants, municipal officials, and their cultural adjuncts were hard at work in the heartland of the former Boer Republics helping to forge new identities\u2014first as 'British South Africans' and then, later still, as 'white South Africans'.\nSome scholars identify these new identities as partly underpinning the act of union that followed in 1910. Although challenged by a Boer rebellion only four years later, they did much to shape South African politics between the two world wars and to the present day.\nMany Boers referred to the war as the second of the \"Freedom Wars\". The most resistant of Boers wanted to continue the fight and were known as \"Bittereinders\" (or \"irreconcilables\") and at the end of the war some Boer fighters such as Deneys Reitz chose exile rather than sign an oath, like the following, to pledge allegiance to Britain:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe bearer, \"&lt;prisoner name&gt;\" has been released from prison of war camp \"&lt;Camp name&gt;\" on signing that he acknowledge terms of surrender and becomes a British subject.\nOver the following decade, many returned to South Africa and never signed the pledge. Some, like Reitz, eventually reconciled themselves to the new \"status quo\", but others did not.\nUnion of South Africa.\nOne of the most important events in the decade after the war was the creation of the Union of South Africa (later the Republic of South Africa). It proved a key ally to Britain as a Dominion of the British Empire during the World Wars. At the start of the First World War a crisis ensued when the South African government led by Louis Botha and other former Boer fighters, such as Jan Smuts, declared support for Britain and agreed to send troops to take over the German colony of German South-West Africa (Namibia).\nMany Boers were opposed to fighting for Britain, especially against Germany, which had been sympathetic to their struggle. Some \"bittereinders\" and their allies took part in a revolt known as the Maritz rebellion. The rebellion was quickly suppressed, and the leading Boer rebels escaped lightly (especially compared with leading Irish rebels of the Easter Rising), with imprisonment of 6-7 years and heavy fines. Two years later, they were released from prison, as Louis Botha recognised the value of reconciliation.\nMilitary legacy.\nThe war was the harbinger of a new type of combat perseveres, guerrilla warfare. The counterinsurgency techniques and lessons learned (the restriction of movement, the containment of space, the targeting of anything that could give sustenance to guerrillas, the harassment through sweeper groups coupled with rapid reaction forces, the sourcing and co-ordination of intelligence, and the nurturing of native allies) were used by the British, and other forces, in future guerrilla campaigns including to counter Malayan communist rebels during the Malayan Emergency. In World War II the British adopted concepts of raiding from the Boer commandos when they set up special raiding forces, and in acknowledgement chose the name British Commandos.\nAfter the Boer war, the British army underwent reform focused on lessening the emphasis placed on mounted units. It was determined that the traditional role of cavalry was antiquated and improperly used on the battlefield in the Boer War, and the First World War was the proof that mounted attacks had no place in twentieth century combat. Cavalry was put to better use after the reforms in the theatres of the Middle East and World War I, and the idea of mounted infantry was useful in the times when the war was more mobile. An example was during the First World War during the Battle of Mons in which the British cavalry held the Belgian town against German assault.\nThe Boer war was the beginning of types of conflict involving machine guns, shrapnel and observation balloons which were all used extensively in the First World War. Both sides used a scorched earth policy to deprive the marching enemy of food. And both had to corral civilians into makeshift huts by 'concentrating' them into camps. For example, at Buffelspoort, British soldiers were held in captivity in Boer encampments after surrendering their arms, and civilians were often mixed in with service personnel because the Boers did not have the resources to do otherwise. 116,000 women, children and Boer soldiers were confined to the Commonwealth concentration camps, of which at least 28,000 would die. \nThe British saw their tactics of scorched earth and concentration camps as a legitimate way of depriving the Boer guerrillas of supplies and safe havens. The Boers saw them as a British attempt to coerce the Boers into surrender, with the camp inmates\u2014mainly families of Boer fighters\u2014seen as deliberately kept in poor conditions to encourage high death rates. Even in the 21st-century, the controversy around the British tactics continued to make headlines.\nEffect on British and international politics.\nMany Irish nationalists sympathised with the Boers as oppressed by British imperialism, much like they viewed themselves. Irish miners already in the Transvaal at the start of the war formed the nucleus of two Irish commandos. The Second Irish Brigade was headed by an Australian of Irish parents, Colonel Arthur Lynch. Groups of Irish volunteers went to fight with the Boers\u2014despite the fact that there were many Irish troops fighting in the British army, including the Royal Dublin Fusiliers. In Britain, the \"Pro-Boer\" campaign expanded, with writers often idealising the Boer society.\nThe war highlighted the dangers of Britain's policy of non-alignment and deepened her isolation. The 1900 UK general election, also known as the \"Khaki election\", was called by the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, on the back of British victories. There was much enthusiasm for the war at this point, resulting in a victory for the Conservative government. However, support waned as it became apparent the war would not be easy and it dragged on, partially contributing to the Conservatives' spectacular defeat in 1906. There was outrage at scorched earth tactics and conditions in the concentration camps. It became apparent there were serious problems with public health in Britain as up to 40% of recruits in Britain were unfit for conscription, and suffered from medical problems such as rickets and other poverty-related illnesses. This came at a time of increasing concern for the poor in Britain.\n22,000 Empire troops were killed. Britain had expected a swift victory against a mostly unmilitarised and predominantly agricultural-based opponent. Britain was the world's most technologically advanced military. The results caused many both domestically and internationally to question the dominance of the British Empire, especially as nations like the US, Germany, and Japan had become major powers.\nCost.\nIt is estimated that the cost of the war to the British government was \u00a3211,156, 000 (equivalent to \u00a319.9bn in 2022).\nHorses.\nThe number of horses killed was unprecedented in modern warfare. The wastage was particularly heavy among British forces for several reasons: overloading of horses with unnecessary equipment and saddlery, failure to rest and acclimatise horses after long sea voyages and, poor management by inexperienced mounted troops and distant control by unsympathetic staffs. The average life expectancy of a British horse, from the time of its arrival in Port Elizabeth, was around six weeks.\nMost horses and mules brought to South Africa came from the US. In total, 109,878 horses and 81,524 mules were shipped from New Orleans to South Africa in 166 voyages from October 1899 to June 1902. The cost of these animals and their transport was an average of US$597,978 per month. A significant number of horses and mules died during the transit; for example, during the SS \"Manchester City\"'s 36-day passage, 187 of her 2,090 mules died.\nHorses were slaughtered for their meat when needed. During the sieges of Kimberley and Ladysmith, horses were consumed as food once regular sources were depleted. The besieged British forces in Ladysmith also produced \"chevril\", a Bovril-like paste, by boiling down the horse meat to a jelly paste and serving it like beef tea.\nThe Horse Memorial in Port Elizabeth is a tribute to the 300,000 horses that died during the conflict.\nCommemorations.\nThe Australian National Boer War Memorial Committee organises events to mark the war on 31 May each year. In Canberra, a commemorative service is usually held at the St John the Baptist Church in Reid. Floral tributes are laid for the dead.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Column/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistoriography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She is best known for her 1862 sensation novel \"Lady Audley's Secret\", which has also been dramatised and filmed several times. Her novel \"Circe\" (1867) was published under the pseudonym Babington White.\nBiography.\nBorn in Soho, London, Mary Elizabeth Braddon was privately educated. Her mother Fanny separated from her father Henry because of his infidelities in 1840, when Braddon was five. When Braddon was ten years old, her brother Edward Braddon left for India and later Australia, where he became Premier of Tasmania. Mary worked as an actress for three years, when she was befriended by Clara and Adelaide Biddle. They were only playing minor roles, but Braddon was able to support herself and her mother. Adelaide noted that Braddon's interest in acting waned as she began writing novels.\nBraddon met John Maxwell (1824\u20131895), a publisher of periodicals, in April 1861 and moved in with him in 1861. However, Maxwell was already married to Mary Ann Crowley, with whom he had five children. While Maxwell and Braddon were living as husband and wife, Crowley was living with her family. In 1864, Maxwell tried to legitimize their relationship by telling the newspapers that they were legally married; \"however, Richard Brinsley Knowles wrote to these papers, informing them that his sister-in-law and true wife of Maxwell was still living, thereby exposing Braddon's 'wife' status as a fa\u00e7ade\". Braddon acted as stepmother to his children until 1874, when Maxwell's wife died and they were able to get married at St. Bride's Church in Fleet Street. Braddon had six children by him: Gerald, Fanny, Francis, William, Winifred Rosalie, and Edward Herry Harrington.Her eldest daughter, Fanny Margaret Maxwell (1863\u20131955), married the naturalist Edmund Selous on 13 January 1886. In the 1920s, they were living in Wyke Castle, where Fanny founded a local branch of the Woman's Institute in 1923, of which she became the first president.\nTheir second eldest son was the novelist William Babington Maxwell (1866\u20131939).\nBraddon died on 4 February 1915 in Richmond (then in Surrey) and is interred in Richmond Cemetery. Her home had been Lichfield House in the centre of the town, which was replaced by a block of flats in 1936, Lichfield Court. There is a plaque commemorating Braddon in Richmond parish church, which calls her simply \"Miss Braddon\". A number of nearby streets are named after characters in her novels \u2013 her husband was a property developer in the area.\nWork.\nWriting.\nBraddon was a prolific writer, producing more than 80 novels with inventive plots. The most famous is \"Lady Audley's Secret\" (1862), which won her recognition and a fortune as a bestseller. Braddon began publishing the first chapters of her novel serially in July, 1861, in \"Robin Goodfellow,\" a literary magazine owned by Maxwell, and then later \"Sixpenny Magazine\". \"Lady Audley's Secret\" was then republished as a novel and sold through nine editions in its first year of publication. It has remained in print since its publication and been dramatised and filmed several times, with the first stage adaptation opening in London by the winter of 1863.\nIn addition to \"Lady Audley's Secret,\" Braddon's other best-known novel, \"Aurora Floyd,\" was published in 1863. Since it also featured a woman trapped in a bigamous relationship, \"Aurora Floyd\" and \"Lady Audley's Secret\" have been referred to as Braddon's \"bigamy novels.\" Like \"Lady Audley, Aurora Floyd\" was first serialized in \"Temple Bar,\" a magazine, before appearing in novelized form.\nR. D. Blackmore's anonymous sensation novel \"Clara Vaughan\" (1864) was wrongly attributed to Braddon by some critics.\nBraddon wrote several works of supernatural fiction, including the pact with the devil story \"Gerard or The World, the Flesh, and the Devil\" (1891), and the ghost stories \"The Cold Embrace\", \"Eveline's Visitant\" and \"At Chrighton Abbey\". From the 1930s onwards, these stories were often anthologised in collections such as Montague Summers's \"The Supernatural Omnibus\" (1931) and \"Fifty Years of Ghost Stories\" (1935). Braddon also wrote historical fiction. \"In High Places\" depicts the youth of Charles I. \"London Pride\" focuses on Charles II. \"Mohawks\" is set during the reign of Queen Anne. \"Ishmael\" is set at the time of Napoleon III's rise to power.\nBraddon founded \"Belgravia\" magazine in 1866. By running her own magazine, Braddon added to the dramatic techniques she had already used in her earlier novels. Through \"Belgravia\", she raised the reputation of her genre by showcasing it in an intentional way. Literary scholar Kate Mattacks, following Braddon's first biographer Robert Wolff, argues that Braddon was trapped into repeating the same formula as \"Lady Audley\u2019s Secret\"\u2014making sensational stories that maintained her income but may have hurt her artistic credibility. This view reflects what Braddon's early critics claimed, that she was \"a slave to the style she created.\" However, when her work as an author and editor of \"Belgravia\" is examined, it becomes clear that Braddon's use of sensation was not a limitation but a deliberate and empowering choice.\n\"Spoiler\" culture appears to have developed mainly as a backlash against sensation fiction. Revealing key plot twists\u2014or spoilers\u2014became a tactic used to undermine the genre's reputation and popularity. Authors like Wilkie Collins and Braddon, who were both initial writers of sensation fiction, tried to counter these criticisms by urging reviewers not to reveal their stories' hidden secrets.\nPublishing.\nBraddon founded \"Belgravia\" magazine (1866), which presented readers with serialised sensation novels, poems, travel narratives and biographies, along with essays on fashion, history and science. It was accompanied by lavish illustrations and offered a source of literature at an affordable cost. She also edited \"Temple Bar\" magazine.\nBraddon was not just a writer of novels, she also worked as a magazine publisher. Thanks to its many illustrations and low cost, \"Belgravia\" helped bring literature to a broader audience.\nLegacy.\nThere is a critical essay on Braddon's work in Michael Sadleir's book \"Things Past\" (1944).\nIn 2014 the Mary Elizabeth Braddon Association was founded to pay tribute to Braddon's life and work.\nInspiration and personal life.\nMary Elizabeth Braddon was an avid reader and began writing stories when she was 11 years old.\nShe had two siblings, Edward and Maggie: Edward left for India in 1847, and Maggie married Antonion Cartighoni and moved to Naples, leaving Mary and her mother alone. This created freedom for Braddon, who moved to the provinces in 1852. She was interested in the theatre and performance, and she began a career on stage. Between the years 1852 and 1860, she spent most of her time travelling the provinces as an actress under the supervision of her mother. She acted in a variety of dramas, for example; Shakespeare, pantomimes, comedies, burlesques, and topical dramas about India and the Crimea. Braddon also took roles in \"some of the most famous melodramas of the period\", including well-known plays such as Black-Eyed Susan and Charles Reade's new works, which would later be transformed into sensation novels. Despite her enthusiasm for and dedication to the theatre, she never had leading roles and due to it, she gradually transferred her energies to writing novels instead. Her acting career inspired her to later write plays and poetry.\nIn January 1864, Maxwell claimed that Braddon and Maxwell were not married.\nPartial list of fiction.\nSome bibliographical material in this incomplete list comes from Jarndyce booksellers' catalogue \"Women's Writers 1795\u20131927. Part I: A\u2013F\" (Summer 2017).\nDramatisations.\nSeveral of Braddon's works have been dramatised, including:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is also known as gavar, gawar, or guvar bean. \nThe genus name \"Cyamopsis\" means \"bean-like\" (from : \"bean\" + : \"view\"). The specific name is from and (itself being a loanword of Ancient Greek \u03bb\u03bf\u03b2\u03cc\u03c2) meaning \"four-squared-lobed\".\nThe origin of \"Cyamopsis tetragonoloba\" is unknown, since it has never been found in the wild. It is assumed to have developed from the African species \"Cyamopsis senegalensis\". It was further domesticated in South Asia, where it has been cultivated for centuries. \nGuar grows well in semiarid areas, but frequent rainfall is necessary.\nThis legume is a valuable plant in a crop rotation cycle, as it lives in symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. \nAgriculturists in semi-arid regions of Rajasthan follow crop-rotation and use guar to replenish the soil with essential fertilizers and nitrogen fixation, before the next crop. Guar has many functions for human and animal nutrition, but the gelling agent in its seeds (guar gum) is the most important use. Demand is rising due to the use of guar gum in hydraulic fracturing (oil shale gas). It is also a major ingredient of the toy Slime. About 80% of world production occurs in India, but due to strong demand, the plant is being introduced elsewhere.\nBiology.\n\"Cyamopsis tetragonoloba\" grows upright, reaching a maximum height of up to . \nIt has a main single stem with either basal branching or fine branching along the stem. \nGuar taproots can access soil moisture in low soil depths. This legume develops root nodules with nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria rhizobia in the surface part of its rooting system.\nIts leaves and stems are mostly hairy, depending on the cultivar. Its fine leaves have an elongated oval shape () and of alternate position. Clusters of flowers grow in the plant axil and are white to blueish in color. The developing pods are rather flat and slim containing 5 to 12 small oval seeds of length (TGW = ). Usually mature seeds are white or gray, but with excess moisture they can turn black and lose germination capacity. The chromosome number of guar seeds is 2n=14.\nThe seeds of guar beans have a remarkable characteristic. Its kernel consists of a protein-rich germ (43\u201346%) and a relatively large endosperm (34\u201340%), containing large amounts of the galactomannan. This is a polysaccharide containing polymers of mannose and galactose in a ratio of 2:1 with many branches. Thus, it exhibits a great hydrogen bonding activity having a viscosifying effect in liquids.\nCultivation.\nClimate requirements.\nGuar is drought-tolerant and sun-loving, but it is susceptible to frost. Although it can cope with low but regular rainfall, it requires sufficient soil moisture before planting and during maturation of seeds. Frequent drought periods can lead to delayed maturation. On the contrary, excessive moisture during the early growth phase and after maturation lead to lower seed quality. Guar is produced near to coastal areas in the Gandhidham region of Kutch, Gujarat, India.\nSoil requirements.\n\"Cyamopsis tetragonoloba\" (L.) can grow on a wide range of soil types. Preferably in fertile, medium-textured and sandy loam soils that are well-drained, since waterlogging decreases plant performance. Guar grows best in moderate alkaline conditions (pH 7\u20138) and is tolerant of salinity. Its taproots are inoculated with rhizobia nodules and thus it produces nitrogen-rich biomass and improves soil quality.\nCultivation areas.\nGuar is grown principally in north-western India with smaller crops grown in the semiarid areas of the high plains of Texas in the US, Australia and Africa. The most important growing area centres on Jodhpur in Rajasthan, India, where demand for guar for fractionation produced an agricultural boom as in 2012. Currently [When? As of 2023?], India is the main producer of cluster bean, accounting for 80% production of the world's total, while the Rajasthan, Gujarat and Kutch regions occupy the largest areas (82.1% of total) dedicated to guar cultivation. In addition to its cultivation in India, the crop is also grown as a cash crop in other parts of the world. Several commercial growers have converted their crops to guar production to support the increasing demand for guar and other organic crops in the United States.\nVarieties.\nPusa Naubahar and Pusa Sadabahar. Seeds at the rate of 30 kilograms/hectare (9\u201311\u00a0lb/acre) are planted at a spacing of 45\u201360 \u00d7 20\u201330\u00a0cm (18\u201324 \u00d7 8\u201312 in) in February\u2013March and June\u2013July. During the rainy season, seeds are sown 2\u20133\u00a0cm (~1 in) deep on ridges and in furrows during summer months. FYM is applied at the rate of 25 tonnes/ha (11.1 tons/acre). N, P2O5 and K2O recommendation for the crop is 20:60:80\u00a0kg/ha (18:53:71\u00a0lb/acre). Average yield is 5 to 6 tonnes/ha (2.2\u20132.6 tons/acre). Meager information is available for genetic variability in cluster bean addressing the qualitative traits (Pathak et al. 2011).\nUses.\nGuar plant.\nAgriculture\nDomestic use\nGuar gum.\nThe seed of the guar bean contains a large endosperm. This endosperm consists of a large polysaccharide of galactose and mannose. This polymer is water-soluble and exhibits a viscosifying effect in water. Guar gum has a multitude of different applications in food products, industrial products, and extractive industry.\nFood.\nIn several food and beverages guar gum is used as additive to change its viscosity or as fiber source.\nPartially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) is produced by the partial enzymatic hydrolysis of guaran, the galactomannan of the endosperm of guar seeds (guar gum). It is a neutral polysaccharide consisting of a mannose backbone chain with single galactose side units occurring on almost two out of every three mannose units. The average molecular weight is about 25,000 daltons. This gives a PHGG that still assays and functions as a soluble dietary fiber.\nPHGG as sold commercially is completely soluble, acid and heat stable, unaffected by ions, and will not gel at high concentrations. Commercial PHGG is approximately 75% dietary fiber and has minimal effect on taste and texture in food and beverage items. PHGG is fully fermentable in the large bowel, with a high rate of volatile fatty acid formation. The pH of the feces is lowered along with an increase in fecal bulk that mainly consists of bacterial cell mass and water. Clinical studies have demonstrated a prebiotic effect of PHGG. Studies have shown that PHGG can be used to maintain regularity. PHGG is used in foods for particulate suspension, emulsification, antistaling, ice crystal control, and reduced fat baked goods.\nIndustry.\nDerivatives of guar gum that have been further reacted are used in industrial applications, such as the paper and textile industries, ore flotation, the manufacture of explosives and hydraulic fracturing (fracking) of oil and gas formations. Guar gum is often crosslinked with boron or chromium ions to make it more stable and heat-resistant. The crosslinking of guar with metal ions results in a gel that does not block the formation and helps efficiently in formation cleaning process. Guar and its derivatives make gel complexes with ions of aluminium, zirconium, titanium, chromium and boron. The borate\u2013guar reaction is reversible, and depends on the pH (hydrogen ion concentration) of the solution. This reaction is used to give the toy \"slime\" its consistency. Crosslinking of guar with borate occurs at high pH (approximately 9\u201310) of the solution. Guar gum has proven as useful substitute for locust bean gum (made from carob seeds).\nFeeds.\nGuar meal korma and guar meal churi are widely used as raw material for producing various kinds of cattle feeds, aqua feeds, fish feeds, poultry feeds, dairy feeds, swine feeds, etc.\nFracking agent.\nThe use of guar gum in the hydraulic fracturing (fracking) extraction of oil and shale gas has increased demand substantially. Only 10% of Indian production is used domestically. The remaining 90% is exported for shale gas and oil industries. Consequently, many former cotton or wheat fields are converted into guar fields as production costs are lower. The increase of guar gum prices also has other reasons. \nFurther reading.\nhttps://www.guargumcultivation.com\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was Braddon's most successful and well-known novel. Critic John Sutherland (1989) described the work as \"the most sensationally successful of all the sensation novels\". The plot centres on \"accidental bigamy\" which was in literary fashion in the early 1860s. The plot was summarised by literary critic Elaine Showalter (1982): \"Braddon's bigamous heroine deserts her child, pushes husband number one down a well, thinks about poisoning husband number two and sets fire to a hotel in which her other male acquaintances are residing\". Elements of the novel mirror themes of the real-life Constance Kent case of June 1860 which gripped the nation for years. Braddon's second 'bigamy' novel, \"Aurora Floyd\", appeared in 1863. Braddon set the story in Ingatestone Hall, Essex, inspired by a visit there. There have been three silent film adaptations, one UK television version in 2000, and three minor stage adaptations.\nHistory.\n\"Lady Audley's Secret\" was partly serialised in \"Robin Goodfellow\" magazine in July\u2013September 1861, then entirely serialised in \"Sixpenny Magazine\" in January\u2013December 1862 and once again serialised in \"The London Journal\" March\u2013August 1863. It was published in 1862 in three volumes by William Tinsley.\nThe novel being published during the serialized fiction trend demonstrates how the Victorian periodical boom redefined reading culture in the 19th century. Publication as a periodical allowed Braddon to build anticipation week by week as she released each consecutive installment, which is the strategy that skyrocketed \"Lady Audley\u2019s Secret\u2019s\" popularity among the middle and working classes, since serialization was a cheaper alternative than releasing full works. \nIronically, the novel was published during extreme Victorian era gender role debates, when society struggled to define the characteristics of a respectable woman. Notorious qualities included submissiveness, kindness, innocence, and motherhood. Many of these Victorian gender ideals were challenged through the characters in the novel, namely through Lady Audley, who wreaked havoc and sought control of her own life, beauty, and wealth rather than stability through a husband.\nBraddon initially sold the rights to the Irish publisher John Maxwell, with whom Braddon also lived and had children. Maxwell published it in his magazine \"Robin Goodfellow\". Braddon wrote the final third in less than two weeks. It was published as a three-volume novel, and it became a success, allowing Braddon to be financially independent for the rest of her life. It was also a financial success for Tinsley, who went on to build a villa in Barnes, \"Audley Lodge\", with the profits.\nNotably \u2013 given the theme of bigamy in the novel's plot \u2013 Maxwell himself was married to another woman, and so Braddon was unable to marry him until his wife died in 1874. When it became public that Maxwell and Braddon had been living in an \"irregular\" arrangement all those years, it caused a minor scandal during which all their servants gave notice.\nIn 1997 a Wordsworth Limited edition was released with an Introduction by Keith Carabine from the University of Kent in which he states, \"In the latter half of the nineteenth century, everyone knew \"Lady Audley\u2019s Secret.\"\nPlot.\nThe novel opens in June 1857 with the marriage of Lucy Graham and Sir Michael Audley. Lucy is a young, beautiful woman who enchants almost all who meet her. Sir Michael is a kindly, wealthy middle-aged widower. Lucy's past is unclear. Prior to marrying Sir Michael she had served as governess for the children of the local doctor, Mr. Dawson, and before that she was in service with Mrs. Vincent. Very little is known about her prior to that. Shortly after the marriage Sir Michael's nephew, the barrister Robert Audley, welcomes his old friend George Talboys back to England.\nThree years before, though happily married, George's financial situation had been desperate. He left for Australia to seek a fortune in gold prospecting. Behind him in England he had left his young wife Helen, whom he is now anxious to get news of. He reads in the newspaper that she has died, and, after visiting her home to confirm this, he becomes despondent. Robert Audley cares for his friend, and, hoping to distract him, offers to take him to his wealthy uncle's country manor. George had a child, Georgey, who was left under the care of Lieutenant Maldon, George's father-in-law. Robert and George set off to visit Georgey, and George decides to make Robert little Georgey's guardian and trustee of \u00a320,000 put into the boy's name. After settling the matter of the boy's guardianship, the two set off to visit Sir Michael.\nWhile at the country manor Audley Court, Lady Audley avoids meeting George. When the two seek an audience with the new Lady Audley, she makes many excuses and avoids their visits. During her absence a thunder storm confines George and Robert to the interior of Audley Court, and the two are shown a portrait of Lady Audley. Looking back toward his friend, Robert notes that George seems disturbed, and attributes his disturbed mood to the storm. Shortly thereafter George disappears. Robert is perplexed. Unwilling to believe George simply left with no notice, Robert begins to look into the circumstances of his disappearance.\nWhile searching for his friend, Robert takes note of the events surrounding George's disappearance. The name of Lady Audley repeatedly appears in these notes, and much to his distress, the evidence begins to collect against her. One night, he reveals his notes to Lady Audley, including that George was in possession of many letters of his former wife. Lady Audley sets off to London, where the letters were kept. Robert follows after her. However, by the time he arrives, he discovers that George's possessions have been broken into and the letters are missing. One possession, however, remains \u2013 a book with a note written by George's wife that matches Lady Audley's handwriting. This confirms Robert's suspicion that Lady Audley is implicated in George's disappearance; it also leads Robert to conclude that Lady Audley is actually George's supposedly dead wife.\nSuspecting the worst of Lady Audley and being afraid for little Georgey's life, Robert travels to Lieutenant Maldon's house and demands possession of the boy. Once Robert has Georgey under his control, he places the boy in a school run by Mr. Marchmont. Afterwards, Robert visits George's father, Mr. Harcourt Talboys, and confronts the Squire with his son's death. Harcourt listens dispassionately to the story. In the course of his visit to the Talboys' manor, Robert is entranced by George's sister Clara, who looks startlingly like George. Clara's passion for finding her brother spurs Robert on.\nIn February 1859, Robert continues searching for evidence. He receives a notice that his uncle is ill, and he quickly returns to Audley Court. While there, Robert speaks with Mr. Dawson and receives a brief description of all that is known about Lucy's background. He hears that Lucy was employed by Mrs. Vincent at her school since 1852. To verify this claim, Robert tracks down Mrs. Vincent, who is in hiding because of debts. According to Miss Tonks, a teacher at Mrs. Vincent's school, Lucy actually arrived at the school in August 1854 and was secretive about her past. Miss Tonks gives Robert a travel box that used to belong to Lucy. Upon examining stickers on the box, Robert discovers both the name Lucy Graham and the name Helen Talboys.\nRobert realizes that Helen Talboys faked her death before creating her new identity. When Robert confronts Lucy, she tells him that he has no proof. He leaves to find more evidence, heading to Castle Inn, which is run by Luke Marks. During the night, Lucy forces Luke's wife, Phoebe, to let her into the inn, then Lucy sets the place afire to kill Robert. However, Robert survives and returns to Audley Court and again confronts Lucy. This time, she says she is insane and confesses her life's story to Robert and Sir Michael, claiming that George abandoned her originally and she had no choice but to abandon her old life and child to find another, wealthier husband.\nSir Michael is unhappy and leaves with Alicia to travel through Europe. Robert invites a Dr. Mosgrave to make a more astute judgment regarding Lucy's sanity, and he proclaims that she is indeed victim to latent insanity, which overpowers her in times of stress and makes her very dangerous to any and all. Lucy, under the name of Madame Taylor, enters a mental institution located somewhere in Belgium along the route between Brussels and Paris. While being committed, Lucy confesses to Robert that she killed George by pushing him down a deserted well in the garden of Audley Court.\nRobert grieves for his friend George until a dying Luke Marks contacts him. Before succumbing to injuries he suffered in the fire, Luke tells Robert that George survived Lady Audley's attempted murder. Luke then helped George escape, with George intending to return to Australia. Robert is overjoyed, and he asks Clara to marry him and go with him to Australia to find George. Clara accepts, but before they set out, George returns and reveals that he actually visited New York instead. The narrative ends with the death of Lucy abroad, and Clara and Robert happily married and living in a country cottage with George and his son. Robert's formerly infatuated cousin Alicia marries her once-spurned suitor, Sir Harry Towers, and Audley Court is left abandoned along with all of its unhappy memories.\nAnalysis and themes.\n\"Lady Audley's Secret\" plays on Victorian anxieties about the domestic sphere. The home was supposed to be a refuge from the dangers of the outside world, but in the novel, the seemingly perfect domestic lady turns out to be a violent criminal who has not only tried to commit murder but who has also committed bigamy and abandoned her child. This unsettled Victorian readers because it indicated that the concepts of \"the perfect lady/mother\" and \"domestic bliss\" were more idealistic than realistic. In addition, anxieties about the increasing urbanization of Britain abound; the city gives Lady Audley the power to change her identity because it renders its citizens effectively anonymous. The small town of Audley is no longer a refuge where everyone knows the life story of every neighbor; the residents of Audley must accept Lucy Graham's account of herself since they have no other information about her past.\nOther anxieties about unstable identity appear throughout the novel: Lady Audley's maid, Phoebe, resembles Lady Audley, thus banishing the idea of physical distinction between the upper and lower classes and therefore of any inherent superiority of the former. \"Lady Audley's Secret\" is, furthermore, a story about gender and class, and Lady Audley's objectionable upward mobility suggests a threat to the paradigm of social class. Women in the Victorian era were expected to be the managers of the home and the caretaker of the children. That was about the extent of their purpose in the eyes of the world at that point, so Lady Audley having power and wealth was out of the norm, and most likely shocked readers at the time.\nMadness is also a key issue. Lady Audley and others often converse about the meaning of this word, but many readers believe that Lady Audley is not mad. In fact, many critics view Lady Audley's deception as a feminist act in which a woman takes control of the direction of her own life. Women in the Victorian era were often diagnosed as \u201cmad\u201d when they did not adhere to the social constructs of the time, which caused many women to be sent to institutions when they were not actually insane. During this period, mental institutions were on the rise, and the conditions were harsh. Overcrowding and lack of professionals caused the patients to not get the help they truly needed.\nThe novel mirrors many of the same themes from the real-life Constance Kent case of June 1860. The first instalment of \"Lady Audley's Secret\" came out almost exactly one year after the Kent murder. The novel, like the real-life case, featured a stepmother and former governess, a mysterious and brutal murder in a country manor house, a body thrown down a well, and characters fascinated by madness. Constance Kent can be seen in many of the female characters in the novel: the murderess Lady Audley, the tomboyish Alicia Audley, the restrained Phoebe Marks and the lonely Clara Talboys. Jack Whicher, the detective and case investigator, can be seen in the character of Robert Audley.\nIn popular culture.\n\"Lady Audley's Secret\" is involved in a subplot of \"Betsy and Tacy Go Downtown\", the fourth book in the Betsy-Tacy series by Maud Hart Lovelace. Betsy has read it and other books in the same genre, and aspires to write similar works.\nIn the Agatha Christie short story \"Greenshaw's Folly\", Miss Greenshaw hides her will in a copy of \"Lady Audley's Secret\", remarking it was a \"best-seller in its day\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "42726", "revid": "49551731", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42726", "title": "Cephalopod", "text": "Class of mollusks\nA cephalopod is any member of the molluscan class Cephalopoda (Greek plural , ; \"head-feet\") such as a squid, octopus, cuttlefish, or nautilus. These exclusively marine animals are characterized by bilateral body symmetry, a prominent head, and a set of arms or tentacles (muscular hydrostats) modified from the primitive molluscan foot. Fishers and Swedes sometimes call cephalopods \"inkfish\", referring to their common ability to squirt ink. The study of cephalopods is a branch of malacology known as teuthology.\nCephalopods became dominant during the Ordovician period, represented by primitive nautiloids. The class now contains two, only distantly related, extant subclasses: Coleoidea, which includes octopuses, squid, and cuttlefish; and Nautiloidea, represented by \"Nautilus\" and \"Allonautilus\". In the Coleoidea, the molluscan shell has been internalized or is absent, whereas in the Nautiloidea, the external shell remains. About 800 living species of cephalopods have been identified. Two important extinct taxa are the Ammonoidea (ammonites) and Belemnoidea (belemnites). Extant cephalopods range in size from the 10\u00a0mm (0.3\u00a0in) \"Idiosepius thailandicus\" to the 700 kilograms (1,500 lb) heavy colossal squid, the largest extant invertebrate.\nDistribution.\nThere are over 800 extant species of cephalopod, although new species continue to be described. An estimated 11,000 extinct taxa have been described, although the soft-bodied nature of cephalopods means they are not easily fossilised.\nCephalopods are found in all the oceans of Earth. None of them can tolerate fresh water, but the brief squid, \"Lolliguncula brevis\", found in Chesapeake Bay, is a notable partial exception in that it tolerates brackish water. Cephalopods are thought to be unable to live in fresh water due to multiple biochemical constraints, and in their &gt;400\u00a0million year existence have never ventured into fully freshwater habitats.\nCephalopods occupy most of the depth of the ocean, from the abyssal plains to the sea surface, and have also been found in the hadal zone. Their diversity is greatest near the equator (~40 species retrieved in nets at 11\u00b0N by a diversity study) and decreases towards the poles (~5 species captured at 60\u00b0N).\nBiology.\nNervous system and behavior.\nCephalopods are widely regarded as the most intelligent of the invertebrates and have well-developed senses and large brains (larger than those of gastropods). The nervous system of cephalopods is the most complex of the invertebrates and their brain-to-body-mass ratio falls between that of endothermic and ectothermic vertebrates. Captive cephalopods have also been known to climb out of their aquaria, maneuver a distance of the lab floor, enter another aquarium to feed on captive crabs, and return to their own aquarium.\nThe brain is protected in a cartilaginous cranium. The giant nerve fibers of the cephalopod mantle have been widely used for many years as experimental material in neurophysiology; their large diameter (due to lack of myelination) makes them relatively easy to study compared with other animals.\nMany cephalopods are social creatures; when isolated from their own kind, some species have been observed shoaling with fish.\nSome cephalopods are able to fly through the air for distances of up to . While cephalopods are not particularly aerodynamic, they achieve these impressive ranges by jet-propulsion; water continues to be expelled from the funnel while the organism is in the air. The animals spread their fins and tentacles to form wings and actively control lift force with body posture. One species, \"Todarodes pacificus\", has been observed spreading tentacles in a flat fan shape with a mucus film between the individual tentacles, while another, \"Sepioteuthis sepioidea\", has been observed putting the tentacles in a circular arrangement.\nSenses.\nCephalopods have advanced vision, can detect gravity with statocysts, and have a variety of chemical sense organs. Octopuses use their arms to explore their environment and can use them for depth perception.\nVision.\nMost cephalopods rely on vision to detect predators and prey and to communicate with one another. Consequently, cephalopod vision is acute: training experiments have shown that the common octopus can distinguish the brightness, size, shape, and horizontal or vertical orientation of objects. The morphological construction gives cephalopod eyes the same performance as shark eyes; however, their construction differs, as cephalopods lack a cornea and have an everted retina. Cephalopods' eyes are also sensitive to the plane of polarization of light. Unlike many other cephalopods, nautiluses do not have good vision; their eye structure is highly developed, but lacks a solid lens. They have a simple \"pinhole\" eye through which water can pass. Instead of vision, the animal is thought to use olfaction as the primary sense for foraging, as well as locating or identifying potential mates.\nAll octopuses and most cephalopods are considered to be color blind. Coleoid cephalopods (octopus, squid, cuttlefish) have a single photoreceptor type and lack the ability to determine color by comparing detected photon intensity across multiple spectral channels. When camouflaging themselves, they use their chromatophores to change brightness and pattern according to the background they see, but their ability to match the specific color of a background may come from cells such as iridophores and leucophores that reflect light from the environment. They also produce visual pigments throughout their body and may sense light levels directly from their body. Evidence of color vision has been found in the sparkling enope squid (\"Watasenia scintillans\"). It achieves color vision with three photoreceptors, which are based on the same opsin, but use distinct retinal molecules as chromophores: A1 (retinal), A3 (3-dehydroretinal), and A4 (4-hydroxyretinal). The A1-photoreceptor is most sensitive to green-blue (484\u00a0nm), the A2-photoreceptor to blue-green (500\u00a0nm), and the A4-photoreceptor to blue (470\u00a0nm) light.\nIn 2015, a novel mechanism for spectral discrimination in cephalopods was described. This relies on the exploitation of chromatic aberration (wavelength-dependence of focal length). Numerical modeling shows that chromatic aberration can yield useful chromatic information through the dependence of image acuity on accommodation. The unusual off-axis slit and annular pupil shapes in cephalopods enhance this ability by acting as prisms which are scattering white light in all directions.\nPhotoreception.\nIn 2015, molecular evidence was published indicating that cephalopod chromatophores are photosensitive; reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) revealed transcripts encoding rhodopsin and retinochrome within the retinas and skin of the longfin inshore squid (\"Doryteuthis pealeii\"), and the common cuttlefish (\"Sepia officinalis\") and broadclub cuttlefish (\"Sepia latimanus\"). The authors claim this is the first evidence that cephalopod dermal tissues may possess the required combination of molecules to respond to light.\nHearing.\nSome octopuses and squids have been shown to detect sound using their statocysts, but, in general, cephalopods are deaf.\nUse of light.\nMost cephalopods possess an assemblage of skin components that interact with light. These may include iridophores, leucophores, chromatophores and (in some species) photophores. Chromatophores are colored pigment cells that expand and contract in accordance to produce color and pattern which they can use in a startling array of fashions. As well as providing camouflage with their background, some cephalopods bioluminesce, shining light downwards to disguise their shadows from any predators that may lurk below. The bioluminescence is produced by bacterial symbionts; the host cephalopod is able to detect the light produced by these organisms. Bioluminescence may also be used to entice prey, and some species use colorful displays to impress mates, startle predators, or even communicate with one another.\nColoration.\nCephalopods can change their colors and patterns in milliseconds, whether for signalling (both within the species and for warning) or active camouflage, as their chromatophores are expanded or contracted. Although color changes appear to rely primarily on vision input, there is evidence that skin cells, specifically chromatophores, can detect light and adjust to light conditions independently of the eyes. The octopus changes skin color and texture during quiet and active sleep cycles.\nCephalopods can use chromatophores like a muscle, which is why they can change their skin hue as rapidly as they do.\nColoration is typically stronger in near-shore species than those living in the open ocean, whose functions tend to be restricted to disruptive camouflage. These chromatophores are found throughout the body of the octopus, however, they are controlled by the same part of the brain that controls elongation during jet propulsion to reduce drag. As such, jetting octopuses can turn pale because the brain is unable to achieve both controlling elongation and controlling the chromatophores. Most octopuses mimic select structures in their field of view rather than becoming a composite color of their full background.\nEvidence of original coloration has been detected in cephalopod fossils dating as far back as the Silurian; these orthoconic individuals bore concentric stripes, which are thought to have served as camouflage. Devonian cephalopods bear more complex color patterns, of unknown function.\nChromatophores.\nColeoids, a shell-less subclass of cephalopods (squid, cuttlefish, and octopuses), have complex pigment containing cells called chromatophores which are capable of producing rapidly changing color patterns. These cells store pigment within an elastic sac which produces the color seen from these cells. Coleoids can change the shape of this sac, called the cytoelastic sacculus, which then causes changes in the translucency and opacity of the cell. By rapidly changing multiple chromatophores of different colors, cephalopods are able to change the color of their skin at astonishing speeds, an adaptation that is especially notable in an organism that sees in black and white. Chromatophores are known to only contain three pigments, red, yellow, and brown, which cannot create the full color spectrum. However, cephalopods also have cells called iridophores, thin, layered protein cells that reflect light in ways that can produce colors chromatophores cannot. The mechanism of iridophore control is unknown, but chromatophores are under the control of neural pathways, allowing the cephalopod to coordinate elaborate displays. Together, chromatophores and iridophores are able to produce a large range of colors and pattern displays.\nAdaptive value.\nCephalopods utilize chromatophores' color changing ability in order to camouflage themselves. Chromatophores allow coleoids to blend into many different environments, from coral reefs to the sandy sea floor. The color change of chromatophores works in concert with papillae, epithelial tissue which grows and deforms through hydrostatic motion to change skin texture. Chromatophores are able to perform two types of camouflage, mimicry and color matching. Mimicry is when an organism changes its appearance to appear like a different organism. The squid \"Sepioteuthis sepioidea\" has been documented changing its appearance to appear as the non threatening herbivorous parrotfish to approach unaware prey. The octopus \"Thaumoctopus mimicus\" is known to mimic a number of different venomous organisms it cohabitates with to deter predators. While background matching, a cephalopod changes its appearance to resemble its surroundings, hiding from its predators or concealing itself from prey. The ability to both mimic other organisms and match the appearance of their surroundings is notable given that cephalopods' vision is monochromatic.\nCephalopods also use their fine control of body coloration and patterning to perform complex signaling displays for both conspecific and intraspecific communication. Coloration is used in concert with locomotion and texture to send signals to other organisms. Intraspecifically this can serve as a warning display to potential predators. For example, when the octopus \"Callistoctopus macropus\" is threatened, it will turn a bright red brown color speckled with white dots as a high contrast display to startle predators. Conspecifically, color change is used for both mating displays and social communication. Cuttlefish have intricate mating displays from males to females. There is also male to male signaling that occurs during competition over mates, all of which are the product of chromatophore coloration displays.\nOrigin.\nThere are two hypotheses about the evolution of color change in cephalopods. One hypothesis is that the ability to change color may have evolved for social, sexual, and signaling functions. Another explanation is that it first evolved because of selective pressures encouraging predator avoidance and stealth hunting.\nFor color change to have evolved as the result of social selection the environment of cephalopods' ancestors would have to fit a number of criteria. One, there would need to be some kind of mating ritual that involved signaling. Two, they would have to experience demonstrably high levels of sexual selection. And three, the ancestor would need to communicate using sexual signals that are visible to a conspecific receiver. For color change to have evolved as the result of natural selection different parameters would have to be met. For one, one would need some phenotypic diversity in body patterning among the population. The species would also need to cohabitate with predators which rely on vision for prey identification. These predators should have a high range of visual sensitivity, detecting not just motion or contrast but also colors. The habitats they occupy would also need to display a diversity of backgrounds. Experiments done in dwarf chameleons testing these hypotheses showed that chameleon taxa with greater capacity for color change had more visually conspicuous social signals but did not come from more visually diverse habitats, suggesting that color change ability likely evolved to facilitate social signaling, while camouflage is a useful byproduct. Because camouflage is used for multiple adaptive purposes in cephalopods, color change could have evolved for one use and the other developed later, or it evolved to regulate trade offs within both.\nConvergent evolution.\nColor change is widespread in ectotherms including anoles, frogs, mollusks, many fish, insects, and spiders. The mechanism behind this color change can be either morphological or physiological. Morphological change is the result of a change in the density of pigment containing cells and tends to change over longer periods of time. Physiological change, the kind observed in cephalopod lineages, is typically the result of the movement of pigment within the chromatophore, changing where different pigments are localized within the cell. This physiological change typically occurs on much shorter timescales compared to morphological change. Cephalopods have a rare form of physiological color change which utilizes neural control of muscles to change the morphology of their chromatophores. This neural control of chromatophores has evolved convergently in both cephalopods and teleosts fishes.\nInk.\nWith the exception of the Nautilidae and the species of octopus belonging to the suborder Cirrina, all known cephalopods have an ink sac, which can be used to expel a cloud of dark ink to confuse predators. This sac is a muscular bag which originated as an extension of the hindgut. It lies beneath the gut and opens into the anus, into which its contents \u2013 almost pure melanin \u2013 can be squirted; its proximity to the base of the funnel means the ink can be distributed by ejected water as the cephalopod uses its jet propulsion. The ejected cloud of melanin is usually mixed, upon expulsion, with mucus, produced elsewhere in the mantle, and therefore forms a thick cloud, resulting in visual (and possibly chemosensory) impairment of the predator, like a smokescreen. However, a more sophisticated behavior has been observed, in which the cephalopod releases a cloud, with a greater mucus content, that approximately resembles the cephalopod that released it (this decoy is referred to as a pseudomorph). This strategy often results in the predator attacking the pseudomorph, rather than its rapidly departing prey. For more information, see Inking behaviors.\nThe ink sac of cephalopods has led to a common name of \"inkfish\", formerly the pen-and-ink fish.\nCirculatory system.\nCephalopods are the only molluscs with a closed circulatory system. Coleoids have two gill hearts (also known as branchial hearts) that move blood through the capillaries of the gills. A single systemic heart then pumps the oxygenated blood through the rest of the body.\nLike most molluscs, cephalopods use hemocyanin, a copper-containing protein, rather than hemoglobin, to transport oxygen. As a result, their blood is colorless when deoxygenated and turns blue when bonded to oxygen. In oxygen-rich environments and in acidic water, hemoglobin is more efficient, but in environments with little oxygen and in low temperatures, hemocyanin has the upper hand. The hemocyanin molecule is much larger than the hemoglobin molecule, allowing it to bond with 96 or CO2 molecules, instead of the hemoglobin's just four. But unlike hemoglobin, which are attached in millions on the surface of a single red blood cell, hemocyanin molecules float freely in the bloodstream.\nRespiration.\nCephalopods exchange gases with the seawater by forcing water through their gills, which are attached to the roof of the organism. Water enters the mantle cavity on the outside of the gills, and the entrance of the mantle cavity closes. When the mantle contracts, water is forced through the gills, which lie between the mantle cavity and the funnel. The water's expulsion through the funnel is used to power jet propulsion. If respiration is used concurrently with jet propulsion, large losses in speed or oxygen generation can be expected. The gills, which are much more efficient than those of other mollusks, are attached to the ventral surface of the mantle cavity. There is a trade-off with gill size regarding lifestyle. To achieve fast speeds, gills need to be small \u2013 water will be passed through them quickly when energy is needed, compensating for their small size. However, organisms which spend most of their time moving slowly along the bottom do not naturally pass much water through their cavity for locomotion; thus they have larger gills, along with complex systems to ensure that water is constantly washing through their gills, even when the organism is stationary. The water flow is controlled by contractions of the radial and circular mantle cavity muscles.\nThe gills of cephalopods are supported by a skeleton of robust fibrous proteins; the lack of mucopolysaccharides distinguishes this matrix from cartilage. The gills are also thought to be involved in excretion, with NH4+ being swapped with K+ from the seawater.\nLocomotion and buoyancy.\nWhile most cephalopods can move by jet propulsion, this is a very energy-consuming way to travel compared to the tail propulsion used by fish. The efficiency of a propeller-driven waterjet (i.e. Froude efficiency) is greater than a rocket. The relative efficiency of jet propulsion decreases further as animal size increases; paralarvae are far more efficient than juvenile and adult individuals. Since the Paleozoic era, as competition with fish produced an environment where efficient motion was crucial to survival, jet propulsion has taken a back role, with fins and tentacles used to maintain a steady velocity. Whilst jet propulsion is never the sole mode of locomotion, the stop-start motion provided by the jets continues to be useful for providing bursts of high speed \u2013 not least when capturing prey or avoiding predators. Indeed, it makes cephalopods the fastest marine invertebrates, and they can out-accelerate most fish. The jet is supplemented with fin motion; in the squid, the fins flap each time that a jet is released, amplifying the thrust; they are then extended between jets (presumably to avoid sinking). Oxygenated water is taken into the mantle cavity to the gills and through muscular contraction of this cavity, the spent water is expelled through the hyponome, created by a fold in the mantle. The size difference between the posterior and anterior ends of this organ control the speed of the jet the organism can produce. The velocity of the organism can be accurately predicted for a given mass and morphology of animal. Motion of the cephalopods is usually backward as water is forced out anteriorly through the hyponome, but direction can be controlled somewhat by pointing it in different directions. Some cephalopods accompany this expulsion of water with a gunshot-like popping noise, thought to function to frighten away potential predators.\nCephalopods employ a similar method of propulsion despite their increasing size (as they grow) changing the dynamics of the water in which they find themselves. Thus their paralarvae do not extensively use their fins (which are less efficient at low Reynolds numbers) and primarily use their jets to propel themselves upwards, whereas large adult cephalopods tend to swim less efficiently and with more reliance on their fins.\nEarly cephalopods are thought to have produced jets by drawing their body into their shells, as \"Nautilus\" does today. \"Nautilus\" is also capable of creating a jet by undulations of its funnel; this slower flow of water is more suited to the extraction of oxygen from the water. When motionless, \"Nautilus\" can only extract 20% of oxygen from the water. The jet velocity in \"Nautilus\" is much slower than in coleoids, but less musculature and energy is involved in its production. Jet thrust in cephalopods is controlled primarily by the maximum diameter of the funnel orifice (or, perhaps, the average diameter of the funnel) and the diameter of the mantle cavity. Changes in the size of the orifice are used most at intermediate velocities. The absolute velocity achieved is limited by the cephalopod's requirement to inhale water for expulsion; this intake limits the maximum velocity to eight body-lengths per second, a speed which most cephalopods can attain after two funnel-blows. Water refills the cavity by entering not only through the orifices, but also through the funnel. Squid can expel up to 94% of the fluid within their cavity in a single jet thrust. To accommodate the rapid changes in water intake and expulsion, the orifices are highly flexible and can change their size by a factor of 20; the funnel radius, conversely, changes only by a factor of around 1.5.\nSome octopus species are also able to walk along the seabed. Squids and cuttlefish can move short distances in any direction by rippling of a flap of muscle around the mantle.\nWhile most cephalopods float (i.e. are neutrally buoyant or nearly so; in fact most cephalopods are about 2\u20133% denser than seawater), they achieve this in different ways.\nSome, such as \"Nautilus\", allow gas to diffuse into the gap between the mantle and the shell; others allow purer water to ooze from their kidneys, forcing out denser salt water from the body cavity; others, like some fish, accumulate oils in the liver; and some octopuses have a gelatinous body with lighter chloride ions replacing sulfate in the body chemistry.\nSquids are the primary sufferers of negative buoyancy in cephalopods. The negative buoyancy means that some squids, especially those whose habitat depths are rather shallow, have to actively regulate their vertical positions. This means that they must expend energy, often through jetting or undulations, in order to maintain the same depth. As such, the cost of transport of many squids are quite high. That being said, squid and other cephalopod that dwell in deep waters tend to be more neutrally buoyant which removes the need to regulate depth and increases their locomotory efficiency.\nThe \"Macrotritopus defilippi\", or the sand-dwelling octopus, was seen mimicking both the coloration and the swimming movements of the sand-dwelling flounder \"Bothus lunatus\" to avoid predators. The octopuses were able to flatten their bodies and put their arms back to appear the same as the flounders as well as move with the same speed and movements.\nFemales of two species, \"Ocythoe tuberculata\" and \"Haliphron atlanticus\", have evolved a true swim bladder.\nOctopus vs. squid locomotion.\nTwo of the categories of cephalopods, octopus and squid, are vastly different in their movements despite being of the same class. Octopuses are generally not seen as active swimmers; they are often found scavenging the sea floor instead of swimming long distances through the water. Squid, on the other hand, can be found to travel vast distances, with some moving as much as 2,000\u00a0km in 2.5\u00a0months at an average pace of 0.9\u00a0body lengths per second. There is a major reason for the difference in movement type and efficiency: anatomy.\nBoth octopuses and squids have mantles (referenced above) which function towards respiration and locomotion in the form of jetting. The composition of these mantles differs between the two families, however. In octopuses, the mantle is made up of three muscle types: longitudinal, radial, and circular. The longitudinal muscles run parallel to the length of the octopus and they are used in order to keep the mantle the same length throughout the jetting process. Given that they are muscles, it can be noted that this means the octopus must actively flex the longitudinal muscles during jetting in order to keep the mantle at a constant length. The radial muscles run perpendicular to the longitudinal muscles and are used to thicken and thin the wall of the mantle. Finally, the circular muscles are used as the main activators in jetting. They are muscle bands that surround the mantle and expand/contract the cavity. All three muscle types work in unison to produce a jet as a propulsion mechanism.\nSquids do not have the longitudinal muscles that octopus do. Instead, they have a tunic. This tunic is made of layers of collagen and it surrounds the top and the bottom of the mantle. Because they are made of collagen and not muscle, the tunics are rigid bodies that are much stronger than the muscle counterparts. This provides the squids some advantages for jet propulsion swimming. The stiffness means that there is no necessary muscle flexing to keep the mantle the same size. In addition, tunics take up only 1% of the squid mantle's wall thickness, whereas the longitudinal muscle fibers take up to 20% of the mantle wall thickness in octopuses. Also because of the rigidity of the tunic, the radial muscles in squid can contract more forcefully.\nThe mantle is not the only place where squids have collagen. Collagen fibers are located throughout the other muscle fibers in the mantle. These collagen fibers act as elastics and are sometimes named \"collagen springs\". As the name implies, these fibers act as springs. When the radial and circular muscles in the mantle contract, they reach a point where the contraction is no longer efficient to the forward motion of the creature. In such cases, the excess contraction is stored in the collagen which then efficiently begins or aids in the expansion of the mantle at the end of the jet. In some tests, the collagen has been shown to be able to begin raising mantle pressure up to 50ms before muscle activity is initiated.\nThese anatomical differences between squid and octopuses can help explain why squid can be found swimming comparably to fish while octopuses usually rely on other forms of locomotion on the sea floor such as bipedal walking, crawling, and non-jetting swimming.\nShell.\nNautiluses are the only extant cephalopods with a true external shell. However, all molluscan shells are formed from the ectoderm (outer layer of the embryo); in cuttlefish (\"Sepia\" spp.), for example, an invagination of the ectoderm forms during the embryonic period, resulting in a shell (cuttlebone) that is internal in the adult. The same is true of the chitinous gladius of squid and octopuses. Cirrate octopods have arch-shaped cartilaginous fin supports, which are sometimes referred to as a \"shell vestige\" or \"gladius\". The Incirrina have either a pair of rod-shaped stylets or no vestige of an internal shell, and some squid also lack a gladius. The shelled coleoids do not form a clade or even a paraphyletic group. The \"Spirula\" shell begins as an organic structure, and is then very rapidly mineralized. Shells that are \"lost\" may be lost by resorption of the calcium carbonate component.\nFemales of the octopus genus \"Argonauta\" secrete a specialized paper-thin egg case in which they reside, and this is popularly regarded as a \"shell\", although it is not attached to the body of the animal and has a separate evolutionary origin.\nThe largest group of shelled cephalopods, the ammonites, are extinct, but their shells are very common as fossils. Ammonites thrived during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras. Their distinctive, spiral-shaped shells are found in sedimentary rocks worldwide and subsequently in many human creations.\nThe deposition of carbonate, leading to a mineralized shell, appears to be related to the acidity of the organic shell matrix (see Mollusc shell); shell-forming cephalopods have an acidic matrix, whereas the gladius of squid has a basic matrix. The basic arrangement of the cephalopod outer wall is: an outer (spherulitic) prismatic layer, a laminar (nacreous) layer and an inner prismatic layer. The thickness of every layer depends on the taxa. In modern cephalopods, the Ca carbonate is aragonite. As for other mollusc shells or coral skeletons, the smallest visible units are irregular rounded granules.\nHead appendages.\nCephalopods, as the name implies, have muscular appendages extending from their heads and surrounding their mouths. These are used in feeding, mobility, and even reproduction. In coleoids they number eight or ten. Decapods such as cuttlefish and squid have five pairs. The longer two, termed \"tentacles\", are actively involved in capturing prey; they can lengthen rapidly (in as little as 15 milliseconds). In giant squid, they may reach a length of 8 metres. They may terminate in a broadened, sucker-coated club. The shorter four pairs are termed \"arms\", and are involved in holding and manipulating the captured organism. They too have suckers, on the side closest to the mouth; these help to hold onto the prey. Octopods only have four pairs of sucker-coated arms, as the name suggests, though developmental abnormalities can modify the number of arms expressed.\nThe tentacle consists of a thick central nerve cord (which must be thick to allow each sucker to be controlled independently) surrounded by circular and radial muscles. Because the volume of the tentacle remains constant, contracting the circular muscles decreases the radius and permits the rapid increase in length. Typically, a 70% lengthening is achieved by decreasing the width by 23%. The shorter arms lack this capability.\nThe size of the tentacle is related to the size of the buccal cavity; larger, stronger tentacles can hold prey as small bites are taken from it; with more numerous, smaller tentacles, prey is swallowed whole, so the mouth cavity must be larger.\nExternally shelled nautilids (\"Nautilus\" and \"Allonautilus\") have on the order of 90 finger-like appendages, termed \"tentacles\", which lack suckers but are sticky instead, and are partly retractable.\nFeeding.\nAll living cephalopods have a two-part beak; most have a radula, although it is reduced in most octopus and absent altogether in \"Spirula\". They feed by capturing prey with their tentacles, drawing it into their mouth and taking bites from it. They have a mixture of toxic digestive juices, some of which are manufactured by symbiotic algae, which they eject from their salivary glands onto their captured prey held in their mouths. These juices separate the flesh of their prey from the bone or shell. The salivary gland has a small tooth at its end which can be poked into an organism to digest it from within.\nThe digestive gland itself is rather short. It has four elements, with food passing through the crop, stomach and caecum before entering the intestine. Most digestion, as well as the absorption of nutrients, occurs in the digestive gland, sometimes called the liver. Nutrients and waste materials are exchanged between the gut and the digestive gland through a pair of connections linking the gland to the junction of the stomach and caecum. Cells in the digestive gland directly release pigmented excretory chemicals into the lumen of the gut, which are then bound with mucus passed through the anus as long dark strings, ejected with the aid of exhaled water from the funnel. Cephalopods tend to concentrate ingested heavy metals in their body tissue. However, octopus arms use a family of cephalopod-specific chemotactile receptors (CRs) to be their \"taste by touch\" system.\nRadula.\nThe cephalopod radula consists of multiple symmetrical rows of up to nine teeth \u2013 thirteen in fossil classes. The organ is reduced or even vestigial in certain octopus species and is absent in \"Spirula\". The teeth may be homodont (i.e. similar in form across a row), heterodont (otherwise), or ctenodont (comb-like). Their height, width and number of cusps is variable between species. The pattern of teeth repeats, but each row may not be identical to the last; in the octopus, for instance, the sequence repeats every five rows.\nCephalopod radulae are known from fossil deposits dating back to the Ordovician. They are usually preserved within the cephalopod's body chamber, commonly in conjunction with the mandibles; but this need not always be the case; many radulae are preserved in a range of settings in the Mason Creek. Radulae are usually difficult to detect, even when they are preserved in fossils, as the rock must weather and crack in exactly the right fashion to expose them; for instance, radulae have only been found in nine of the 43 ammonite genera, and they are rarer still in non-ammonoid forms: only three pre-Mesozoic species possess one.\nExcretory system.\nMost cephalopods possess a single pair of large nephridia. Filtered nitrogenous waste is produced in the pericardial cavity of the branchial hearts, each of which is connected to a nephridium by a narrow canal. The canal delivers the excreta to a bladder-like renal sac, and also resorbs excess water from the filtrate. Several outgrowths of the lateral vena cava project into the renal sac, continuously inflating and deflating as the branchial hearts beat. This action helps to pump the secreted waste into the sacs, to be released into the mantle cavity through a pore.\n\"Nautilus\", unusually, possesses four nephridia, none of which are connected to the pericardial cavities.\nThe incorporation of ammonia is important for shell formation in terrestrial molluscs and other non-molluscan lineages. Because protein (i.e., flesh) is a major constituent of the cephalopod diet, large amounts of ammonium ions are produced as waste. The main organs involved with the release of this excess ammonium are the gills. The rate of release is lowest in the shelled cephalopods \"Nautilus\" and \"Sepia\" as a result of their using nitrogen to fill their shells with gas to increase buoyancy. Other cephalopods use ammonium in a similar way, storing the ions (as ammonium chloride) to reduce their overall density and increase buoyancy.\nReproduction and life cycle.\nCephalopods are a diverse group of species, but share common life history traits, for example, they have a rapid growth rate and short life spans. Stearns (1992) suggested that in order to produce the largest possible number of viable offspring, spawning events depend on the ecological environmental factors of the organism. The majority of cephalopods do not provide parental care to their offspring, except, for example, octopus, which helps this organism increase the survival rate of their offspring. Marine species' life cycles are affected by various environmental conditions. The development of a cephalopod embryo can be greatly affected by temperature, oxygen saturation, pollution, light intensity, and salinity. These factors are important to the rate of embryonic development and the success of hatching of the embryos. Food availability also plays an important role in the reproductive cycle of cephalopods. A limitation of food influences the timing of spawning along with their function and growth. Spawning time and spawning vary among marine species; it's correlated with temperature, though cephalopods in shallow water spawn in cold months so that the offspring would hatch at warmer temperatures. Breeding can last from several days to a month.\nSexual maturity.\nCephalopods that are sexually mature and of adult size begin spawning and reproducing. After the transfer of genetic material to the following generation, the adult cephalopods in most species then die. Sexual maturation in male and female cephalopods can be observed internally by the enlargement of gonads and accessory glands. Mating would be a poor indicator of sexual maturation in females; they can receive sperm when not fully reproductively mature and store them until they are ready to fertilize the eggs. Males are more aggressive in their pre-mating competition when in the presence of immature females than when competing for a sexually mature female. Most cephalopod males develop a hectocotylus, an arm tip which is capable of transferring their spermatozoa into the female mantle cavity. Though not all species use a hectocotylus; for example, the adult nautilus releases a spadix. Some male squids, mainly deep-water species, have instead evolved a penis longer than their own body length, the longest penis in any free-living animals. It is assumed these males simply attach a spermatophore anywhere on a female's body. An indication of sexual maturity of females is the development of brachial photophores to attract mates.\nFertilization.\nCephalopods are not broadcast spawners. During the process of fertilization, the females use sperm provided by the male via external fertilization. Internal fertilization is seen only in octopuses. The initiation of copulation begins when the male catches a female and wraps his arm around her, either in a \"male to female neck\" position or mouth to mouth position, depending on the species. The males then initiate the process of fertilization by contracting their mantle several times to release the spermatozoa. Cephalopods often mate several times, which influences males to mate longer with females that have previously, nearly tripling the number of contractions of the mantle. To ensure the fertilization of the eggs, female cephalopods release a sperm-attracting peptide through the gelatinous layers of the egg to direct the spermatozoa. Female cephalopods lay eggs in clutches; each egg is composed of a protective coat to ensure the safety of the developing embryo when released into the water column. Reproductive strategies differ between cephalopod species. In the giant Pacific octopus, large eggs are laid in a den; it will often take several days to lay all of them. Once the eggs are released and normally attached to a sheltered substrate, the female usually die shortly after, but octopuses and a few squids will look after their eggs afterwards. Others, like the Japanese flying squid, will spawn neutrally buoyant egg masses which will float at the interface between water layers of slightly different densities, or the female will swim around while carrying the eggs with her. Most species are semelparous (only reproduce once before dying), the only known exceptions are the vampire squid, the lesser Pacific striped octopus and the nautilus, which are iteroparous. In some species of cephalopods, egg clutches are anchored to substrates by a mucilaginous adhesive substance. These eggs are swelled with perivitelline fluid (PVF), a hypertonic fluid that prevents premature hatching. Fertilized egg clusters are neutrally buoyant depending on the depth that they were laid, but can also be found in substrates such as sand, a matrix of corals, or seaweed. Because these species do not provide parental care for their offspring, egg capsules can be injected with ink by the female in order to camouflage the embryos from predators.\nMale\u2013male competition.\nMost cephalopods engage in aggressive sex: a protein in the male capsule sheath stimulates this behavior. They also engage in male\u2013male aggression, where larger males tend to win the interactions. When a female is near, the males charge one another continuously and flail their arms. If neither male backs away, the arms extend to the back, exposing the mouth, followed by the biting of arm tips. During mate competition males also participate in a technique called flushing. This technique is used by the second male attempting to mate with a female. Flushing removes spermatophores in the buccal cavity that was placed there by the first mate by forcing water into the cavity. Another behavior that males engage in is sneaker mating or mimicry \u2013 smaller males adjust their behavior to that of a female in order to reduce aggression. By using this technique, they are able to fertilize the eggs while the larger male is distracted by a different male. During this process, the sneaker males quickly insert drop-like sperm into the seminal receptacle.\nMate choice.\nMate choice is seen in cuttlefish species, where females prefer some males over others, though characteristics of the preferred males are unknown. A hypothesis states that females reject males by olfactory cues rather than visual cues. Several cephalopod species are polyandrous \u2013 accepting and storing multiple male spermatophores, which has been identified by DNA fingerprinting. Females are no longer receptive to mating attempts when holding their eggs in their arms. Females can store sperm in two places (1) the buccal cavity where recently mated males place their spermatophores, and (2) the internal sperm-storage receptacles where sperm packages from previous males are stored. Spermatophore storage results in sperm competition; which states that the female controls which mate fertilizes the eggs. In order to reduce this sort of competition, males develop agonistic behaviors like mate guarding and flushing. The \"Hapalochlaena lunulata\", or the blue-ringed octopus, readily mates with both males and females.\nSexual dimorphism.\nIn a variety of marine organisms, it is seen that females are larger in size compared to the males in some closely related species. In some lineages, such as the blanket octopus, males become structurally smaller and smaller resembling a term, \"dwarfism\" dwarf males usually occurs at low densities. The blanket octopus male is an example of sexual-evolutionary dwarfism; females grow 10,000 to 40,000 times larger than the males and the sex ratio between males and females can be distinguished right after hatching of the eggs.\nEmbryology.\nCephalopod eggs span a large range of sizes, from 1 to 30\u00a0mm in diameter. The fertilised ovum initially divides to produce a disc of germinal cells at one pole, with the yolk remaining at the opposite pole. The germinal disc grows to envelop and eventually absorb the yolk, forming the embryo. The tentacles and arms first appear at the hind part of the body, where the foot would be in other molluscs, and only later migrate towards the head.\nThe funnel of cephalopods develops on the top of their head, whereas the mouth develops on the opposite surface. The early embryological stages are reminiscent of ancestral gastropods and extant Monoplacophora.\nThe shells develop from the ectoderm as an organic framework which is subsequently mineralized. In \"Sepia\", which has an internal shell, the ectoderm forms an invagination whose pore is sealed off before this organic framework is deposited.\nDevelopment.\nThe length of time before hatching is highly variable; smaller eggs in warmer waters are the fastest to hatch, and newborns can emerge after as little as a few days. Larger eggs in colder waters can develop for over a year before hatching. The process from spawning to hatching follows a similar trajectory in all species, the main variable being the amount of yolk available to the young and when it is absorbed by the embryo.\nUnlike most other molluscs, cephalopods do not have a morphologically distinct larval stage. Instead, the juveniles of coleoids are known as paralarvae. Paralarvae have been observed only in members of the Octopoda and Teuthida (which constitutes the modern definition of Coleoidea). In contrast, hatchling nautili are not referred to by a specific technical term, as they resemble miniatures of the adults. Neonate cephalopods quickly learn how to hunt, using encounters with prey to refine their strategies.\nGrowth in juveniles is usually allometric, whilst adult growth is isometric.\nEvolution.\nThe traditional view of cephalopod evolution holds that they evolved in the Late Cambrian from a monoplacophoran-like ancestor with a curved, tapering shell, which was closely related to the gastropods (snails). The similarity of the early shelled cephalopod \"Plectronoceras\" to some gastropods was used in support of this view. The development of a siphuncle would have allowed the shells of these early forms to become gas-filled (thus buoyant) in order to support them and keep the shells upright while the animal crawled along the floor, and separated the true cephalopods from putative ancestors such as \"Knightoconus\", which lacked a siphuncle. Neutral or positive buoyancy (i.e. the ability to float) would have come later, followed by swimming in the Plectronocerida and eventually jet propulsion in more derived cephalopods.\nPossible early Cambrian remains have been found in the Avalon Peninsula, matching genetic data for a pre-Cambrian origin. However, this specimen is later shown that is a chimerical fossil.\nIn 2010, some researchers proposed that \"Nectocaris pteryx\" is the early cephalopod, which did not have a shell and appeared to possess jet propulsion in the manner of \"derived\" cephalopods, complicated the question of the order in which cephalopod features developed. However, most of other researchers doubt that \"Nectocaris\" was actually a cephalopod or even a mollusk, and in 2025 a study definitively found it to be a relative of modern chaetognaths (arrow worms).\nEarly cephalopods were likely predators near the top of the food chain. After the late Cambrian extinction led to the disappearance of many radiodonts, predatory niches became available for other animals. During the Ordovician period, the primitive cephalopods underwent pulses of diversification to become diverse and dominant in the Paleozoic and Mesozoic seas.\nIn the Early Palaeozoic, their range was far more restricted than today; they were mainly constrained to sublittoral regions of shallow shelves of the low latitudes, and usually occurred in association with thrombolites. A more pelagic habit was gradually adopted as the Ordovician progressed. Deep-water cephalopods, whilst rare, have been found in the Lower Ordovician \u2013 but only in high-latitude waters.\nThe mid-Ordovician saw the first cephalopods with septa strong enough to cope with the pressures associated with deeper water, and could inhabit depths greater than 100\u2013200\u00a0m. The direction of shell coiling would prove to be crucial to the future success of the lineages; endogastric coiling would only permit large size to be attained with a straight shell, whereas exogastric coiling \u2013 initially rather rare \u2013 permitted the spirals familiar from the fossil record to develop, with their corresponding large size and diversity. (Endogastric means the shell is curved so as the ventral or lower side is longitudinally concave (abdomen in); exogastric means the shell is curved so as the ventral side is longitudinally convex (abdomen out) allowing the funnel to be pointed backward beneath the shell.)\nThe ancestors of coleoids (including most modern cephalopods) and the ancestors of the modern nautilus, had diverged by the Floian Age of the Early Ordovician Period, over 470 million years ago. The Bactritida, a Devonian\u2013Triassic group of orthocones, are widely held to be paraphyletic without the coleoids and ammonoids, that is, the latter groups arose from within the Bactritida. An increase in the diversity of the coleoids and ammonoids is observed around the start of the Devonian period and corresponds with a profound increase in fish diversity. This could represent the origin of the two derived groups.\nUnlike most modern cephalopods, most ancient varieties had protective shells. These shells at first were conical but later developed into curved nautiloid shapes seen in modern nautilus species.\nCompetitive pressure from fish is thought to have forced the shelled forms into deeper water, which provided an evolutionary pressure towards shell loss and gave rise to the modern coleoids, a change which led to greater metabolic costs associated with the loss of buoyancy, but which allowed them to recolonize shallow waters. However, some of the straight-shelled nautiloids evolved into belemnites. The loss of the shell may also have resulted from evolutionary pressure to increase maneuverability, resulting in a more fish-like habit.\nThere has been debate on the embryological origin of cephalopod appendages. Until the mid-20th century, the \"Arms as Head\" hypothesis was widely recognized. In this theory, the arms and tentacles of cephalopods look similar to the head appendages of gastropods, suggesting that they might be homologous structures. Cephalopod appendages surround the mouth, so logically they could be derived from embryonic head tissues. However, the \"Arms as Foot\" hypothesis, proposed by Adolf Naef in 1928, has increasingly been favoured; for example, fate mapping of limb buds in the chambered nautilus indicates that limb buds originate from \"foot\" embryonic tissues.\nGenetics.\nThe sequencing of a full cephalopod genome has remained challenging to researchers due to the length and repetition of their DNA. The characteristics of cephalopod genomes were initially hypothesized to be the result of entire genome duplications. Following the full sequencing of a California two-spot octopus, the genome showed similar patterns to other marine invertebrates with significant additions to the genome assumed to be unique to cephalopods. No evidence of full genome duplication was found.\nWithin the California two-spot octopus genome there are substantial replications of two gene families. Significantly, the expanded gene families were only previously known to exhibit replicative behaviour within vertebrates. The first gene family was identified as the protocadherins which are attributed to neuron development. Protocadherins function as cell adhesion molecules, essential for synaptic specificity. The mechanism for protocadherin gene family replication in vertebrates is attributed to complex splicing, or cutting and pasting, from a locus. Following the sequencing of the California two-spot octopus, researchers found that the protocadherin gene family in cephalopods has expanded in the genome due to tandem gene duplication. The different replication mechanisms for protocadherin genes indicate an independent evolution of protocadherin gene expansion in vertebrates and invertebrates. Analysis of individual cephalopod protocadherin genes indicate independent evolution between species of cephalopod. A species of shore squid \"Doryteuthis pealeii\" with expanded protocadherin gene families differ significantly from those of the California two-spot octopus suggesting gene expansion did not occur before speciation within cephalopods. Despite different mechanisms for gene expansion, the two-spot octopus protocadherin genes were more similar to vertebrates than squid, suggesting a convergent evolution mechanism. The second gene family known as are small proteins that function as zinc transcription factors. are understood to moderate DNA, RNA and protein functions within the cell.\nThe sequenced California two spot octopus genome also showed a significant presence of transposable elements as well as transposon expression. Although the role of transposable elements in marine vertebrates is still relatively unknown, significant expression of transposons in nervous system tissues have been observed. In a study conducted on vertebrates, the expression of transposons during development in the fruitfly \"Drosophila melanogaster\" activated genomic diversity between neurons. This diversity has been linked to increased memory and learning in mammals. The connection between transposons and increased neuron capability may provide insight into the observed intelligence, memory and function of cephalopods.\nUsing long-read sequencing, researchers have decoded the cephalopod genomes and discovered they have been churned and scrambled. The genes were compared to those of thousands of other species and while blocks of three or more genes co-occurred between squid and octopus, the blocks of genes were not found together in any other animals'. Many of the groupings were in the nervous tissue, suggesting the course they adapted their intelligence.\nPhylogeny.\nThe approximate consensus of extant cephalopod phylogeny, after Whalen &amp; Landman (2022), is shown in the cladogram. Mineralized taxa are in bold.\nThe internal phylogeny of the cephalopods is difficult to constrain; many molecular techniques have been adopted, but the results produced are conflicting. \"Nautilus\" tends to be considered an outgroup, with \"Vampyroteuthis\" forming an outgroup to other squid; however in one analysis the nautiloids, octopus and teuthids plot as a polytomy. Some molecular phylogenies do not recover the mineralized coleoids (\"Spirula\", \"Sepia\", and \"Metasepia\") as a clade; however, others do recover this more parsimonious-seeming clade, with \"Spirula\" as a sister group to \"Sepia\" and \"Metasepia\" in a clade that had probably diverged before the end of the Triassic.\nMolecular estimates for clade divergence vary. One 'statistically robust' estimate has \"Nautilus\" diverging from \"Octopus\" at https://\u00a0\u00b1\u00a024\u00a0million years ago.\nTaxonomy.\nThe classification presented here, for recent cephalopods, follows largely from http:// (May 2001), for fossil cephalopods takes from Arkell et al. 1957, Teichert and Moore 1964, Teichert 1988, and others. The three subclasses are traditional, corresponding to the three orders of cephalopods recognized by Bather.\nClass Cephalopoda (\u2020 indicates extinct groups)\nOther classifications differ, primarily in how the various decapod orders are related, and whether they should be orders or families.\nSuprafamilial classification of the \"Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology\".\nThis is the older classification that combines those found in parts K and L of the \"Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology\", which forms the basis for and is retained in large part by classifications that have come later.\nNautiloids in general (Teichert and Moore, 1964) sequence as given.\n Subclass \u2020 Endoceratoidea. Not used by Flower, e.g. Flower and Kummel 1950, interjocerids included in the Endocerida.\n Order \u2020 Endocerida\n Order \u2020 Intejocerida\n Subclass \u2020 Actinoceratoidea Not used by Flower, ibid\n Order \u2020 Actinocerida\n Subclass Nautiloidea Nautiloidea in the restricted sense.\n Order \u2020 Ellesmerocerida Plectronocerida subsequently split off as separate order.\n Order \u2020 Orthocerida Includes orthocerids and pseudorthocerids\n Order \u2020 Ascocerida\n Order \u2020 Oncocerida\n Order \u2020 Discosorida\n Order \u2020 Tarphycerida\n Order \u2020 Barrandeocerida A polyphyletic group now included in the Tarphycerida\n Order Nautilida\n Subclass \u2020 Bactritoidea\n Order \u2020 Bactritida\nPaleozoic Ammonoidea (Miller, Furnish and Schindewolf, 1957)\n Suborder \u2020 Anarcestina\n Suborder \u2020 Clymeniina\n Suborder \u2020 Goniatitina\n Suborder \u2020 Prolecanitina\nMesozoic Ammonoidea (Arkel et al., 1957)\n Suborder \u2020 Ceratitina\n Suborder \u2020 Phylloceratina\n Suborder \u2020 Lytoceratina\n Suborder \u2020 Ammonitina\nSubsequent revisions include the establishment of three Upper Cambrian orders, the Plectronocerida, Protactinocerida, and Yanhecerida; separation of the pseudorthocerids as the Pseudorthocerida, and elevating orthoceratid as the Subclass Orthoceratoidea.\nShevyrev classification.\nShevyrev (2005) suggested a division into eight subclasses, mostly comprising the more diverse and numerous fossil forms, although this classification has been criticized as arbitrary, lacking evidence, and based on misinterpretations of other papers.\nClass Cephalopoda\nCladistic classification.\nAnother recent system divides all cephalopods into two clades. One includes nautilus and most fossil nautiloids. The other clade (Neocephalopoda or Angusteradulata) is closer to modern coleoids, and includes belemnoids, ammonoids, and many orthocerid families. There are also stem group cephalopods of the traditional Ellesmerocerida that belong to neither clade.\nThe coleoids, despite some doubts, appear from molecular data to be monophyletic.\nIn culture.\nAncient seafaring people were aware of cephalopods, as evidenced by such artworks as a stone carving found in the archaeological recovery from Bronze Age Minoan Crete at Knossos (1900 \u2013 1100 BC), which has a depiction of a fisherman carrying an octopus. The terrifyingly powerful Gorgon of Greek mythology may have been inspired by the octopus or squid, the octopus's body representing the severed head of Medusa, the beak as the protruding tongue and fangs, and its tentacles as the snakes.\nThe kraken is a legendary sea monster of giant proportions said to dwell off the coasts of Norway and Greenland, usually portrayed in art as a giant cephalopod attacking ships. Linnaeus included it in the first edition of his 1735 \"Systema Naturae\". In a Hawaiian creation myth that says the present cosmos is the last of a series which arose in stages from the ruins of the previous universe, the octopus is the lone survivor of the previous, alien universe. The Akkorokamui is a gigantic tentacled monster from Ainu folklore.\nA battle with an octopus plays a significant role in Victor Hugo's book \"Travailleurs de la mer\" (\"Toilers of the Sea\"), relating to his time in exile on Guernsey. \nIan Fleming's 1966 short story collection \"Octopussy and The Living Daylights\", and the 1983 \"James Bond\" film were partly inspired by Hugo's book.\nJapanese erotic art, \"shunga\", includes ukiyo-e woodblock prints such as Katsushika Hokusai's 1814 print \"Tako to ama\" (The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife), in which an ama diver is sexually intertwined with a large and a small octopus. The print is a forerunner of tentacle erotica.\nIts many arms that emanate from a common center means that the octopus is sometimes used to symbolize a powerful and manipulative organization.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This reflection is caused by imperfections or physical variations in the cable (such as abrupt changes in its geometry) that lead to impedance mismatches. These mismatches disrupt the signal and cause some of it to bounce back. In radio frequency (RF) systems, this is typically measured using the voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR), with device called a VSWR bridge. The amount of reflected energy depends on the degree of impedance mismatch and is mathematically described by the reflection coefficient.\nBecause the principles are the same, this concept is perhaps easiest to understand when considering an optical fiber. Imperfections in the glass create mirrors that reflect the light back along the fiber.\nImpedance discontinuities cause attenuation, attenuation distortion, standing waves, ringing and other effects because a portion of a transmitted signal will be reflected back to the transmitting device rather than continuing to the receiver, much like an echo. This effect is compounded if multiple discontinuities cause additional portions of the remaining signal to be reflected back to the transmitter. This is a fundamental problem with the daisy chain method of connecting electronic components. \nWhen a returning reflection strikes another discontinuity, some of the signal rebounds in the original signal direction, creating multiple echo effects. These forward echoes strike the receiver at different intervals making it difficult for the receiver to accurately detect data values on the signal. The effects can resemble those of jitter.\nBecause damage to the cable can cause reflections, an instrument called an electrical time-domain reflectometer (ETDR; for electrical cables) or an optical time-domain reflectometer (OTDR; for optical cables) can be used to locate the damaged part of a cable. These instruments work by sending a short pulsed signal into the cable and measuring how long the reflection takes to return. If only reflection magnitudes are desired, however, and exact fault locations are not required, VSWR bridges perform a similar but lesser function for RF cables.\nThe combination of the effects of signal attenuation and impedance discontinuities on a communications link is called insertion loss. Proper network operation depends on constant characteristic impedance in all cables and connectors, with no impedance discontinuities in the entire cable system. When a sufficient degree of impedance matching is not practical, echo suppressors or echo cancellers, or both, can sometimes reduce the problems.\nThe Bergeron diagram method, valid for both linear and non-linear models, evaluates the reflection's effects in an electric line.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was founded in 1836 as Emory College by the Methodist Episcopal Church and named in honor of Methodist bishop John Emory. Its main campus is in Druid Hills, from downtown Atlanta.\nEmory University comprises nine undergraduate, graduate, and professional schools, including Emory College of Arts and Sciences, Goizueta Business School, Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing, Oxford College, Emory University School of Medicine, Emory University School of Law, Rollins School of Public Health, Candler School of Theology, and Laney Graduate School. Emory University enrolls nearly 16,000 students from the U.S. and over 100 foreign countries.\nEmory Healthcare is the largest healthcare system in the state of Georgia and comprises seven major hospitals, including Emory University Hospital and Emory University Hospital Midtown. The university operates the Winship Cancer Institute, Emory National Primate Research Center, and many disease and vaccine research centers. Emory University is adjacent to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and is a long-time partner in global and national prevention and research initiatives. The International Association of National Public Health Institutes is headquartered at the university. Emory University has the 15th-largest endowment among U.S. colleges and universities. The university is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities \u2013 Very high research activity\". Emory University was elected to the Association of American Universities in 1995.\nEmory faculty and alumni include one vice president of the United States, two prime ministers, two Nobel Peace Prize laureates, and a United States Supreme Court Justice. Other notable alumni include twenty-one Rhodes Scholars and six Pulitzer Prize winners. Emory has more than 165,000 alumni.\nHistory.\nNineteenth century.\nEmory College was founded in 1836 in Oxford, Georgia, by the Methodist Episcopal Church. The college was named in honor of the departed Methodist bishop John Emory. Ignatius Alphonso Few was the college's first president. In 1854, the Atlanta Medical College, a forerunner of Emory University School of Medicine, was founded. On April 12, 1861, the American Civil War began. Emory College was closed in November 1861 and all of its students enlisted on the Confederate side. In late 1863 the war reached Georgia and the college was used as hospital and later a headquarters for the Union Army. The university produced many officers who served in the war, including General George Thomas Anderson (1846C) who fought in nearly every major battle in the eastern theater. Thirty-five Emory students lost their lives and much of the campus was destroyed during the war.\nIn 1880, Atticus Greene Haygood, Emory College President, delivered a speech expressing gratitude for the end of slavery in the United States, which captured the attention of George I. Seney, a New York banker. Seney gave Emory College $5,000 to repay its debts, $50,000 for construction, and $75,000 to establish a new endowment. In the 1880s, the technology department was launched by Isaac Stiles Hopkins, a polymath professor at Emory College. Hopkins became the first president of the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1888. Emory University's first international student, Yun Chi-ho, graduated in 1893. Yun became an important political activist in Korea.\nTwentieth century.\nOn August 16, 1906, the Wesley Memorial Hospital and Training School for Nurses, later renamed the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing, was established. In 1914, the Candler School of Theology was established. In 1915, Emory College relocated to Druid Hills and was rechartered as Emory University after accepting a land grant from Asa Griggs Candler, founder of The Coca-Cola Company and brother of commissioned chair Warren Akin Candler Based on large donations from the Candler, Woodruff, and Goizueta families, Emory University is colloquially referred to as \"Coca-Cola University\". Emory University School of Law was established in 1916.\nFirst and Second World Wars.\nIn 1917, the United States joined the First World War, and Emory University responded by organizing a medical unit composed of faculty and alumni of the medical school. The unit, which became known as Emory Unit, Base Hospital 43, served in Loir-et-Cher, France, from July 1918 to January 1919. During the Second World War, the Emory Unit was mobilized once again and served in the North African campaign and Europe. Emory's contributions to the war effort were recognized by christening a ship, M.S. Emory Victory, which served during World War II and the Korean War.\nIn the 1940s, Emory University students, alumni, and faculty served in the Asia-Pacific War and European theater of World War II. Lieutenant Commander James L. Starnes, a graduate of Emory Law, was the navigator of the battleship and served as officer of the deck during the signing of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender. Bobby Jones, the golfer, served during the Battle of Normandy. Alfred A. Weinstein, a professor of surgery at Emory University School of Medicine, was a prisoner of war of the Empire of Japan between 1942 and 1945. His memoir, \"Barbed Wire Surgeon\", is considered one of the finest accounts concerning allied prisoners under Japanese captivity and highlights the abuses of the war criminal Mutsuhiro Watanabe. Kiyoshi Tanimoto, who graduated from the Candler School of Theology in 1940 and is portrayed in John Hersey's \"Hiroshima\", was able to organize the Hiroshima Maidens reconstructive surgery program based on the associations he made while studying in the United States. Tatsumasa Shirakawa, a Japanese student at the Candler School of Theology, was placed under arrest temporarily until Dean Henry Burton Trimble negotiated his release. Emory helped the nation prepare for war by participating in the V-12 Navy College Training Program and Army Specialized Training Program, programs designed to supplement the force of commissioned officers in the United States Navy and United States Army. The Candler School of Theology trained men for military chaplaincy. During the war, university enrollment boasted two military students for every one civilian. Emory University alumni would go on to serve in the Korean War, Second Indochina War (Vietnam War), Persian Gulf War, Yugoslav Wars, and the global war on terrorism.\nWomen's and civil rights movements.\nThe women's movement and civil rights movement during the 1950s and 1960s in the United States profoundly shaped the future of Emory University. Formerly an all-male school, Emory officially became a coeducational institution in 1953. Although it had previously admitted women under limited circumstances, the university had never before had a policy through which they could enroll in large numbers and as resident students. In 1959, sororities first appeared on campus. In 1962, in the midst of the civil rights movement, Emory embraced the initiative to end racial restrictions when it asked the courts to declare portions of the Georgia statutes unconstitutional. Previously, Georgia law denied tax-exempt status to private universities with racially integrated student bodies. The Supreme Court of Georgia ruled in Emory's favor and Emory officially became racially integrated. Marvin S. Arrington Sr. was Emory University's first, full-time African American student and graduated from Emory University School of Law in 1967.\nIn 1971, Emory established one of the nation's first African-American studies programs and the first of its kind in the Southeastern United States. Emory's diversity and academic reputation continued to flourish under the leadership of the university's fifth president, James T. Laney. In addition to leading universities in the Southeastern United States in the promotion of racial equality, Laney and many of the school's faculty and administrators were outspoken advocates of global human rights and thus were openly opposed to the military dictatorship in South Korea (1961\u20131987). On March 30, 1983, Laney's friend Kim Dae-jung, while in political exile in the United States, presented a speech on human rights and democracy at Emory University and accepted an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. Kim would go on to play a major role in ending authoritarianism in South Korea, served as the eighth president of South Korea from 1998 to 2003, and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 for his successful implementation of the Sunshine Policy. Laney would later serve as United States Ambassador to South Korea and Emory graduate school, founded in 1919, was named in his honor in 2009.\nIn 2005, the university presented the President Medal, a rare award conferred only on individuals whose impact on the world has enhanced the dominion of peace or has enlarged the range of cultural achievement, to Civil Rights Movement activist Rosa Parks. The award is one of the highest honors presented by Emory.\nIn 2014, at Emory's 169th Commencement, John Lewis, the only living \"Big Six\" leader of the civil rights movement, delivered the keynote address and received an honorary doctor of laws degree. In 2015, Emory University School of Law received a $1.5 million donation to help establish a John Lewis Chair in Civil Rights and Social Justice. The gift, given anonymously, funds a professorship which will enable Emory Law to conduct a national search for a scholar with an established academic profile of distinction and a demonstrated desire to promote the rule of law through the study of civil rights. The law school has committed to raise an additional $500,000 to fund the chair fully.\nExpansion and modernization.\nIn November 1979, Emory University experienced a historical shift when Robert Winship Woodruff and George Waldo Woodruff donated $105 million worth of Coca-Cola stock to the institution. At that time, this was the largest single gift ever made to any institution of higher education in the United States.\nTwenty-first century.\nThe latest additions to the Atlanta Campus include buildings for cancer research, biomedical research, scientific computation, mathematics and science, vaccine research, and the performing arts.\nPrior to 2018, the campus was in an unincorporated area, statistically counted in the Druid Hills census-designated place. In 2016 the university stated that it intended to petition to be annexed into the City of Atlanta; in 2017 the university leadership formally submitted its petition. The City of Atlanta annexed Emory's campus effective January 1, 2018, a part of its largest annexation within a period of 65 years; the Atlanta City Council voted to do so the prior December.\nGregory L. Fenves, formerly the president of the University of Texas at Austin, became Emory University's 21st president in August 2020.\nThe Gaza war sparked demonstrations around the U.S., including at Emory. On April 25, 2024, during a pro-Palestinian protest, immediately subsequent to each objecting to the police presence, police detained both philosophy chair No\u00eblle McAfee and arrested economics professor Caroline Fohlin, who was later charged with battery, following her battering by police. The College of Arts and Science adopted a motion the following day for a college faculty no-confidence vote for Greg Fenves, president of the university, with an electronic vote organized for the following week.\nAcademics.\nAdmissions.\nEmory University is considered highly selective. The median SAT score of the class of 2023 was 1500 and median ACT score was 34. In 2022, Emory University received 33,517 applications and had a 9% regular decision admission rate and a 10.6% overall admission rate. The Scholars Programs have an acceptance rate of just 2%. The enrolling class was 55.4% female, 44.6% male and 10.4% of enrolling class identify as first-generation college students. Fifty-nine unique languages were spoken in the enrolling first year class and 40 countries were represented. The university is need-blind for domestic applicants.\nUndergraduate schools.\nEmory College of Arts and Sciences.\nEmory College of Arts and Sciences offers the Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) and the Bachelor of Science (B.S) undergraduate academic degrees.

The Emory University library system includes over 3.9 million print and electronic volumes and 83,000-plus electronic journals. The Rose Library contains rare materials relating to literature, African American history and culture, and Southern and Georgia history. Notable among the collections are papers of Flannery O'Connor, Alice Walker, Langston Hughes, Salman Rushdie, W. B. Yeats, Medbh McGuckian, Seamus Heaney, and Ted Hughes.\nIn 2012, \"The Princeton Review\" ranked Emory University among the \"10 Colleges with the Best Libraries\" in the United States.\nRankings and reputation.\nEmory University is ranked 24th among national universities in the United States and 69th among global universities by \"U.S. News &amp; World Report for\" 2024-2025\". Times Higher Education World University Rankings\" ranked Emory 20th in the United States and 82nd among global universities for 2022\u20132023. In 2023, QS University Rankings listed Emory as 155th among global universities. The university was ranked 17th among colleges and universities in the United States in a \"The Wall Street Journal\" survey.\nEmory was named as one of the \"25 New Ivies\" in 2006 by \"Newsweek\". Emory has also been referred to as a \"Hidden Ivy\". In 2024 and 2025, Forbes included Emory in its list of 20 \"New Ivies\".\n\"The Princeton Review\" named Emory University School of Law as one of the best 169 law schools in the U.S. in 2014. The Emory University School of Law is ranked 35th in the nation according to \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\"'s 2023-2024 rankings.\n\"Bloomberg Businessweek\" ranked Goizueta Business School's BBA Program ninth in the nation in 2014. In 2023, Goizueta Business School's MBA program ranked 17th in the nation by \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" and 16th in the nation by \"Bloomberg Businessweek.\" \"Financial Times\" ranked the MBA program 36th worldwide in 2023.\n\"Times Higher Education World University Rankings\" placed the School of Medicine at #32 in the world for Clinical/Pre-clinical and Health in its 2019 rankings list. The Emory University School of Medicine is ranked 23rd in the nation from \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\"'s 2023\u20132024 rankings and also ranked 14th for Radiology, 16th for Surgery, #14 for Obstetrics and Gynecology, and 15th for Internal Medicine.\n\"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" ranked the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing 1st in the nation for MSN programs and 3rd for BSN programs for its 2023\u20132024 rankings. QS University Rankings listed the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing as the 25th top nursing school globally in 2023.\nThe Rollins School of Public Health ranked 3rd in the nation in 2024 by \"U.S. News &amp; World Report.\"\nThe Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering, a collaboration between Emory University and the Georgia Institute of Technology, was ranked 1st in the nation in 2024 by \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\".\nControversies.\nIn 2012, Emory University underwent an internal investigation that revealed deliberate falsification of information by members of Emory University's Office of Admission and Institutional Research. These individuals intentionally misreported data concerning entering students' standardized test scores and class rankings between 2000 and 2012 to standard reference sources and third parties who rank colleges and universities. The falsified data aimed to boost the university's rankings. For example, while the office reported an 89% graduation rate within the top 10% of the class, the actual figure stood at only 75%. Following the investigation, the individuals responsible either resigned or were terminated, and the university issued a public apology to address the misconduct. To prevent future inaccuracies in data collection and reporting, Emory University took corrective actions in 2012 and 2013. These measures included the employment of independent data advisers to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the university's data management processes.\nResearch.\nFacilities and partnerships.\nEmory University is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities \u2013 Very high research activity\". In 2021, Emory received $894.7 million from external funding agencies. Emory University leads the nation in the number of students with Kirschstein-National Research Service Award pre-doctoral fellowships from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\nIn 1947, the university donated of land to the United States Department of Health and Human Services for the construction of the CDC headquarters. Emory University Prevention Research Center (EPRC) and Emory Center for Injury Control are funded by the CDC. Emory University's African Center of Excellence for Public Health Security, which seeks to improve preparedness and response to health threats in low-income countries, is a five-year, multimillion-dollar cooperative program with the CDC and International Association of National Public Health Institutes (IANPHI). Emory University Center for Global Safe Water (CGSW), which conducts applied research, evaluation, and training to promote global health equity through universal access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene, works in collaboration with the CDC. Emory University Global Health Institute, funded by the Gates Foundation, partners with the CDC to enhance public health infrastructure in low-resource countries. Emory University Hospital Isolation Unit and Quarantine Station was established by the CDC following the 2003 SARS outbreak. The isolation and treatment facilities at Emory University played a crucial role in ending the 2014 ebola virus cases in the United States. CDC scientists and administrators hold memberships and frequently speak at Emory University's Vaccine Dinner Club (VDC), an association that holds monthly academic meetings to discuss and advance vaccine research. In 2015, Emory was made a member of the CDC's Prevention Epicenters Program, a research program in which CDC's Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion (DHQP) collaborates with academic investigators to conduct innovative infection control and prevention research.\nIn 2015, Emory University, the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, the Public Health Foundation of India, and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences established the Center for Control of Chronic Conditions in New Delhi, India. The center aims to improve the prevention and care of diabetes, heart disease, cancer, mental health, and injuries in India.\nThe International Association of National Public Health Institutes is based at the university. The association was chartered in 2006 with a $20 million, five-year grant through Emory University from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2015, the Emory Global Health Institute and CDC were made lead partners for the newly created, $75 million Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation-funded Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance Network (CHAMPS).\nEmory University research is heavily funded by the United States Department of Health and Human Services's National Institutes of Health. The federal agency awarded the university nearly $600 million in the fiscal year of 2021. In 2015, Emory University was one of four institutions selected by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for its seven-year, multimillion-dollar Tuberculosis Research Units (TBRU) program, which aims to drive innovation in tuberculosis research and reduce the global burden of the disease. In 2015, an Emory-led research consortium received a five-year, $15 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to research human immune responses to Varicella zoster virus and pneumococcal vaccination. The university also received a $9 million grant over five years from the NIH to support one of three national Centers for Collaborative Research in Fragile X syndrome. The grant is a renewal of Emory's National Fragile X Research Center, continuously funded by the NIH for more than 10 years. In 2015, the university received an $8.9 million grant over five years from the NIH National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) to better understand the role of reactive oxygen species and inflammation in blood vessel function and to explore new interventions and preventive approaches for atherosclerosis and aortic aneurysms. In 2015, the university received an $8 million grant over five years from the NIH to develop and validate mathematical models of how prior immunity affects recall immune responses to influenza viruses. The researchers will create and disseminate powerful, user-friendly modeling tools for use by the wider research community in developing more effective vaccines. In 2015, the university received a $3.6 million grant over five years from the NIH to examine the effects of maternal stress on brain function, development, and behavior in African-American infants, including the biochemical connection between the brain and the microbiome. In 2015, the university received a $3.5 million grant over five years from the NIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) for an Informatics Technology for Cancer Research award. Winship Cancer Institute and Emory School of Medicine researchers will develop software tools to help the cancer research community gain new insights from cancer imaging \"big data\" and develop new open-source cancer research applications. In 2015, the university received a $3.4 million grant from the NIH International Collaborations in Infectious Disease Research Program to support a partnership between the Emory Vaccine Center and the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB) in New Delhi, India to study dengue virus infection in India.\nThe Emory University Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) and the Emory Vaccine Center are world leaders in AIDS Vaccine Development and HIV Pathogenesis studies are funded by nine different institutes of the NIH and by the Georgia Research Alliance. The centers include one of the largest groups of academic vaccine scientists in the world and are currently attempting to develop an effective HIV vaccine. Emory University researchers Dennis C. Liotta, Raymond F. Schinazi, and Woo-Baeg Choi discovered Emtricitabine, a nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) used in the treatment of HIV. The drug was named as one of the world's most important antiviral drugs by the World Health Organization and is included in their Model List of Essential Medicines.\nEmory University was one of three institutions that successfully treated medical evacuees during the 2014 ebola outbreak. In 2015, the United States Department of Health and Human Services named Emory University the lead coordinating center for the National Ebola Training and Education Center (NETEC). The university collaborated with the University of Nebraska Medical Center, the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, the CDC and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response on the program, which received $12 million. The university also received a $10.8 million grant over three years from the U.S. Department of Defense's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to lead a 10-institution national team developing improved therapeutics and vaccines for multiple strains of Ebola virus. In 2015, Emory received a three-year, $2.2 million grant from the CDC to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, including Ebola, in health-care facilities.\nIn 2015, Emory and Georgia Tech were awarded an $8.3 million grant by the NIH to establish a National Exposure Assessment Laboratory. The laboratory will research the impact of environmental chemicals on children's health. In 2015, the two universities received a five-year, $2.9 million grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to create new bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degree programs and concentrations in healthcare robotics, which will be the first program of its kind in the Southeastern United States. In 2015, Emory University, Georgia Tech, and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta were awarded a four-year, $1.8 million grant by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation in order to expand the Atlanta Cystic Fibrosis Research and Development Program. As of 2015[ [update]], Emory jointly manages the second-largest cystic fibrosis population in the United States. In 2015, Emory and Georgia Tech received a $1.6 million grant from the Coulter Translational Research Partnership Program to accelerate nine promising technologies developed in research laboratories with commercialization potential.\nIn 2015, Emory University received a $15 million grant from the Wounded Warrior Project in order to establish the \"Warrior Care Network\" and develop innovative approaches to treat veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI).\nIn 2015, Emory University and the University of South Florida received a $2.5 million grant over five years from the John E. Fogarty International Center to study links between infectious disease transmission and agricultural practices.\nIn 2023, Emory celebrated the opening of Georgia's largest health sciences research building. The eight-story, 350,000-square-foot building houses more than 1,000 researchers, including 130 principal investigators, from across a variety of specialties including: pediatrics, biomedical engineering, Winship Cancer Institute, cardiovascular medicine, the Emory Vaccine Center, radiology and brain health. The project cost $313 million to complete.\nIn 2023, Emory launched a global university network consisting of University of Bonn, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, University of St Andrews, and Waseda University to deepen partnership in education, research, leadership and innovation.\nCampuses.\nEmory University's original campus was established in Oxford, Georgia, in 1836. The campus, located east of Emory's Atlanta Campus, is home to Oxford College of Emory University and was the site of military headquarters and infirmaries during the American Civil War. Many of the buildings were designed with Neoclassical architecture and Gothic Revival architecture. In 1975, the United States National Register of Historic Places designated the campus as part of the Oxford Historic District.\nEmory's Atlanta Campus, established in the early twentieth century on a Beaux-Arts master plan by Pittsburgh architect Henry Hornbostel, covers more than in Atlanta's historic neighborhood of Druid Hills. The university campus is heavily forested with pine, maples, oak, and magnolias, and Peavine Creek, a branch of the Peachtree Creek, runs through the campus. The Arbor Day Foundation named Emory a Tree Campus USA school in 2015. Many of the university's buildings are designed with multi-hued granite and Spanish Saltillo tile. The university has one of the largest inventories by square footage of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design-certified building space among campuses in the United States.\nThe campus is home to Emory University Hospital, Michael C. Carlos Museum, which has the largest collection of ancient artifacts in the Southeastern United States, the Winship Cancer Institute, Georgia's first and only cancer center designated by the National Cancer Institute, the Yerkes National Primate Research Center, one of eight National Institutes of Health-funded national primate research centers, and a number of other academic, art, medical, and student facilitates. In 1991, Emory opened the first collegiate LGBT student center in the Southeastern United States which is the tenth oldest in the nation. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Cancer Society, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Egleston hospital, and Emory Point are located adjacent to the campus.\nIn 2015, a $52 million expansion and renovation project of the Sanford S. Atwood Chemistry Center was completed. The new, complex contains laboratories, interactive teaching and study spaces, and a chemistry library. The completion of the complex was accompanied by a $1.2 million grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute to advance and modernize the university's chemistry curriculum.\nIn the Candler Library Annex of Robert W. Woodruff Library, there is a 1920s Pietro Caproni reproduction of Bertel Thorvaldsen's \"The Triumph of Alexander\" frieze. The frieze depicts Alexander the Great and his army entering Babylon after their victory over the Achaemenid Empire at the Battle of Gaugamela.\nDuring the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, the university hosted the United States Olympic women's gymnastics team on its Atlanta Campus. The team, known as the Magnificent Seven, won the first-ever gold medal for the United States in the women's team all-around competition. The university housed international officials and journalists and served as a training facility for Olympians. The Cox Hall Ballroom was transformed into a news center for the Olympic foreign press.\nIn February 2017, Emory announced that its R. Howard Dobbs University Center, built in 1986 from a neofuturistic postmodernist design by local architect John C. Portman Jr., to house the university's main student/faculty center and dining hall (Coca-Cola Commons), would be demolished and replaced with a new $98 million Campus Life Center, designed by Durham, North Carolina\u2013based Duda Paine Architects. Reasons given for the replacement included inconvenience of food delivery to the dining hall, undersized kitchen facilities, and inadequate fenestration in the Commons. The Emory Student Center (ESC), opened in May 2019, includes a dining hall, study and collaboration spaces, game room, a 1,400-plus-person multipurpose space, coffee shop, and food emporium. It is the first building on Emory's campus to receive a LEED platinum rating.\nStudent life.\nStudent body.\nIn fall 2024, the university had a total enrollment of 16,142 students, with a full-time equivalent (FTE) enrollment of 15,121. Of the total enrolled students, 60.2% identified as female (9,719) and 39.8% as male (6,423). The age distribution included 0.6% under age 18, 65.4% between the ages of 18 and 24, and 34.1% who were 25 or older.\nEmory reported that 23.5% of students (3,800) identified as members of historically underrepresented groups (HUGs), while 76.5% (12,342) did not. Regarding first-generation college student status, 7.5% (1,210) of undergraduates identified as first-generation, 41.0% (6,616) were non-first-generation students, and 3.4% (548) had an unknown status. Graduate students made up 48.1% of the total enrollment (7,768).\nIn terms of racial and ethnic diversity, 0.1% of students identified as American Indian or Alaskan Native, 19.7% as Asian, 13.8% as Black or African American, 9.6% as Hispanic or Latino, and 0.1% as Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. Students identifying as two or more races comprised 9.4% of the population, while 32.2% identified as White. Nonresident aliens, typically international students, represented 18.2% of the total enrollment, and 2.5% of students had race or ethnicity listed as unknown.\nNinety-six percent of enrolled students (15,494) were pursuing a degree, while 4.0% (648) were non-degree-seeking. Emory\u2019s academic career distribution was nearly even, with 51.9% of students enrolled as undergraduates (8,374) and 48.1% as graduate or professional students (7,768). Most students, 90.5% (14,610), were enrolled full-time, while 9.5% (1,532) are part-time.\nWith regard to residency, 21.0% of students were from the state of Georgia, 60.9% were from out of state, and 18.2% were international students. Students were distributed across Emory's nine academic divisions: Emory College of Arts and Sciences enrolled the largest share at 34.5% (5,567), followed by Goizueta Business School at 14.4% (2,319), Laney Graduate School at 13.0% (2,092), and the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing at 8.6% (1,393). Other divisions included the School of Medicine (6.4%, 1,032), Oxford College (6.0%, 967), Rollins School of Public Health (6.1%, 977), School of Law (5.2%, 839), Allied Health Programs (3.3%, 534), and Candler School of Theology (2.6%, 422).\nArts.\nStudents may engage in the performing and fine arts as an area of academic study or as extracurricular activities. Undergraduates may pursue a major in the performing arts (dance, theater, or music) or in film studies, art history, visual arts, or creative writing. Graduate programs in art history, film studies, and music are offered. There are more than 50 student organizations dedicated to the arts. Students can explore artistic interests as diverse as architecture, breakdancing, poetry, and improvisational comedy. Emory routinely hosts arts events in the Schwartz Center for Performing Arts that are open to the Emory and Atlanta communities. Recent performances include Bang on a Can All-Stars (a side project of drummer Glenn Kotche from the rock band Wilco), jazz performer Esperanza Spalding, and New York's Cedar Lake Dance Company. A program called Creativity Conversations brings artistic minds to campus to discuss art and the creative process. Guests have included Philip Glass, Jimmy Carter, Salman Rushdie, Seamus Heaney and Rita Dove. Rita Dove also gave the keynote address at Emory's 2013 Commencement.\nBarkley Forum.\nThe Barkley Forum Center for Debate Education is an intercollegiate debate organization at Emory University. The center is named in honor of Emory alumnus Alben Barkley, 35th vice president of the United States. Debating was established at the university in 1837 and the intercollegiate debate team was formed in 1914. Emory's Barkley Forum debate team has won three National Debate Tournaments and over 25 individual champion speaker awards.\nCommunity service.\nThe university received the 2008 Presidential Award for General Community Service, which is the highest federal recognition given to higher education institutions for their commitment to community service, service-learning and civic engagement. About 25% of Emory students participate in Volunteer Emory, Emory's umbrella community service group. Emory Cares International Service Day contributes to projects organized by Emory and partners around the city of Atlanta, and beyond.\nNewspaper.\n\"The Emory Wheel\" is the student-run newspaper of Emory University. Serving the Emory community since 1919, the \"Wheel\" is editorially and financially independent from the university. The staff is composed entirely of students, with the exception of the general manager, who oversees advertising and whose salary is paid by the newspaper.\nGreek life.\nFraternities have existed on Emory's campus as early as 1840. One early chronicler makes the case that Emory's \"temple\" of the Mystic Seven may have been the first chapter of a national fraternity established anywhere in the South. Today, approximately 20% of the Emory student population participates. There are approximately eight sorority chapters and eleven fraternity chapters.\nStudent organizations.\nHundreds of student clubs and organizations operate on Emory's campus. These include numerous student government, special interest, and service organizations. The Student Government Association charters and provides most of the funding for other student groups and represents students' interests when dealing with the administration. Emory also has several secret societies\u2014the Paladin Society, the D.V.S. Senior Honor Society, Ducemus, Speculum, and the Order of Ammon. Coca-Cola pledged three million dollars over a five-year period for \"Service for Learning,\" which coordinates Emory student volunteers in various projects.\nThere is an intramural sports program and a variety of recreational and competitive intramural teams.\nAthletics.\nEmory's 18 varsity sports teams, known as the Eagles, are members of the NCAA's Division III in the University Athletic Association (UAA).\nEmory consistently ranks among top schools in the Directors' Cup of the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics (NACDA) for best all-around athletics program.\nNotable alumni and faculty.\nEmory University has over 13,200 faculty and staff members and over 133,000 living alumni.\nNotable alumni include Alben Barkley (BA 1900), 35th vice president of the United States; Isaac Stiles Hopkins (1859C) and Robert Stewart Hyer (BA 1881, MA 1882), founding presidents of Georgia Institute of Technology and Southern Methodist University, respectively; Young John Allen (1858C), American Methodist missionary in the late Qing Dynasty, China; Thomas Milton Rivers (1909C); Dumas Malone, Jefferson biographer and director of the Harvard University Press (AB, 1910); Ernest Cadman Colwell (1923C, 1927 PhD), president of the University of Chicago; Bobby Jones (Law 1929), the only golfer to win a Grand Slam, founder of the Masters Golf Tournament, and regarded as one of the greatest golfers of all time; Ely Callaway Jr. (1940C), founder of the Callaway Golf Company; Ernie Harwell (1940C), baseball broadcaster for the Detroit Tigers; Arnall Patz (BA 1943, MD 1945), Lee Hong-koo (1959C), 26th prime minister of the Republic of Korea; Newt Gingrich (BA 1965), speaker of the House of Representatives; Sonny Carter, NASA astronaut, crew member of STS-33 Space Shuttle mission (1969C); Peter Buck, guitarist for the band R.E.M.; Kenneth Cole (BA 1976), clothing designer and founder of Kenneth Cole Productions; Christopher McCandless (1990C), Alaskan wilderness adventurer and main subject of Jon Krakauer's \"Into the Wild\"; Fala Chen (2005C), Chinese American actress; Kirsten Haglund (2013C), Miss America 2008; Duncan L.

{"id": "42734", "revid": "37575500", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42734", "title": "Transcendental Meditation", "text": "Form of mantra meditation\nTranscendental Meditation (TM) is a form of silent meditation developed by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. The TM technique involves the silent repetition of a \"mantra\" or sound, and is practiced for 15\u201320 minutes twice per day. It is taught by certified teachers through a standard course of instruction, with a cost which varies by country and individual circumstance.\nAccording to the TM organization, it is a non-religious method that promotes relaxed awareness, stress relief, self-development, and higher states of consciousness. The technique has been variously described as both religious and non-religious. TM has been described by scientists, academics, and skeptics as pseudoscientific, including for its promise of supernatural abilities (including yogic flying) and for disguising Vedic-Hindu religious ideas as scientific.\nMaharishi began teaching the technique in India in the mid-1950s. Building on the teachings of his master, the Hindu Advaita Vedanta monk Brahmananda Saraswati (known honorifically as Guru Dev), the Maharishi taught thousands of people during a series of world tours from 1958 to 1965, expressing his teachings in spiritual and religious terms. TM became more popular in the 1960s and 1970s as the Maharishi shifted to a more secular presentation, and his meditation technique was practiced by celebrities, most prominently members of the Beatles and the Beach Boys. At this time, he began training TM teachers. The worldwide TM organization had grown to include educational programs, health products, and related services. Following the Maharishi's death in 2008, leadership of the TM organization passed to neuroscientist Tony Nader.\nResearch on TM began in the 1970s. A 2012 meta-analysis of the psychological impact of meditation found that Transcendental Meditation had a comparable effect on general wellbeing as other meditation techniques. A 2017 overview of systematic reviews and meta-analyses indicates TM practice may lower blood pressure, an effect comparable with other health interventions. Because of a potential for bias and conflicting findings, more research is needed.\nHistory.\nThe Transcendental Meditation program and the Transcendental Meditation movement originated with their founder Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and continued beyond his death in 2008. In 1955, \"the Maharishi began publicly teaching a traditional meditation technique\" learned from his master Brahmananda Saraswati that he called Transcendental Deep Meditation and later renamed Transcendental Meditation.\nThe Maharishi initiated thousands of people, then developed a TM teacher training program as a way to accelerate the rate of bringing the technique to more people. He also inaugurated a series of tours that started in India in 1955 and went international in 1958 which promoted Transcendental Meditation. These factors, coupled with endorsements by celebrities who practiced TM and claims that scientific research had validated the technique, helped to popularize TM in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1984, the phrase \"Transcendental Mediation\" was trademarked by the Maharishi Foundation, LTD. By the late 2000s, TM had been taught to millions of individuals and the Maharishi was overseeing a large multinational movement. Despite organizational changes and the addition of advanced meditative techniques in the 1970s, the Transcendental Meditation technique has remained relatively unchanged.\nAmong the first organizations to promote TM were the Spiritual Regeneration Movement and the International Meditation Society. In modern times, the movement has grown to encompass schools and universities that teach the practice, and includes many associated programs based on the Maharishi's interpretation of the Vedic traditions. In the U.S., non-profit organizations included the Students International Meditation Society, AFSCI, World Plan Executive Council, Maharishi Vedic Education Development Corporation, Global Country of World Peace, Transcendental Meditation for Women, and Maharishi Foundation. The successor to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, and leader of the Global Country of World Peace, is Tony Nader.\nTechnique.\nThe meditation practice involves the use of a silently-used mantra for 15\u201320 minutes twice per day while sitting with the eyes closed. It is reported to be one of the most widely practiced, and among the most widely researched, meditation techniques, with hundreds of published research studies. The technique is made available worldwide by certified TM teachers in a seven-step course, and fees vary from country to country. Beginning in 1965, the Transcendental Meditation technique has been incorporated into selected schools, universities, corporations, and prison programs in the US, Latin America, Europe, and India. In 1977, a US district court ruled that a curriculum in TM and the Science of Creative Intelligence (SCI) being taught in some New Jersey schools was religious in nature and in violation of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. The technique has since been included in a number of educational and social programs around the world.\nThe Transcendental Meditation technique has been described as both religious and non-religious, as an aspect of a new religious movement, as rooted in Hinduism, and as a non-religious practice for self-development.\nThe public presentation of the TM technique over its 50-year history has been praised for its high visibility in the mass media and effective global propagation, and criticized for using celebrity and scientific endorsements as a marketing tool. Also, advanced courses supplement the TM technique and include an advanced meditation program called the TM-Sidhi program, the unveiling of which created media controversy and a time of crisis for the movement's image. In 2014, a meta-analysis of research found insufficient evidence that meditation such as TM \"had an effect on any of the psychological stress and well-being outcomes\".\nMovement.\nThe Transcendental Meditation movement consists of the programs and organizations connected with the Transcendental Meditation technique and founded by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Transcendental Meditation was first taught in the 1950s in India and has continued since the Maharishi's death in 2008. The organization was estimated to have 900,000 participants worldwide in 1977, a million by the 1980s, and five million by the time of Maharishi's death in 2008.\nPrograms include the Transcendental Meditation technique, an advanced meditation practice called the TM-Sidhi program (\"Yogic Flying\"), an alternative health care program called Maharishi Ayurveda, and a system of building and architecture called Maharishi Sthapatya Ved. The TM movement's past and present media endeavors include a publishing company (MUM Press), a television station (KSCI), a radio station (KHOE), and a satellite television channel (Maharishi Channel). During its 50-year history, its products and services have been offered through a variety of organizations, which are primarily nonprofit and educational. These include the Spiritual Regeneration Movement, the International Meditation Society, World Plan Executive Council, Maharishi Vedic Education Development Corporation, Transcendental Meditation for Women, the Global Country of World Peace, and the David Lynch Foundation.\nThe TM movement also operates a worldwide network of Transcendental Meditation teaching centers, schools, universities, health centers, herbal supplements, solar panel, and home financing companies, plus several TM-centered communities. The global organization is reported to have an estimated net worth of USD 3.5 billion. The TM movement has been characterized in a variety of ways and has been called a spiritual movement, a new religious movement, a millenarian movement, a world affirming movement, a new social movement, a guru-centered movement, a personal growth movement, a religion, and a cult. Additional sources contend that TM and its movement are not a cult. Participants in TM programs are not required to adopt a belief system; it is practiced by atheists, agnostics and people from a variety of religious affiliations. \nThe organization has been the subject of controversies that includes being labelled a cult by several parliamentary inquiries or anti-cult movements in the world.\nSome notable figures in pop-culture practicing TM include the Beatles, the Beach Boys, Kendall Jenner, Hugh Jackman, Tom Hanks, Jennifer Lopez, Mick Jagger, Eva Mendez, Moby, David Lynch, Jennifer Aniston, Nicole Kidman, Eric Andr\u00e9, Jerry Seinfeld, Howard Stern, Julia Fox, Clint Eastwood, Martin Scorsese, Russell Brand, Nick Cave and Oprah Winfrey.\nHealth effects.\nThe first studies of the health effects of Transcendental Meditation appeared in the early 1970s.\nThere is no good evidence that TM reduces anxiety, or has any beneficial effect on forms of psychological stress or well-being.\nA 2012 review found that Transcendental Meditation performed no better overall than other meditation techniques. The authors' analysis of a subset of these studies, those that studied specific categories of outcome, found that TM might perform better in reducing negative emotions, trait anxiety, and neuroticism and improving markers of learning, memory, and self-actualization, but performs more poorly in reducing negative personality traits, reducing stress, improving attention and mindfulness and cognition, in comparison with other meditation approaches.\nA statement from the American Heart Association said that TM could be considered as a treatment for hypertension, although other interventions such as exercise and device-guided breathing were more effective and better supported by clinical evidence.\nTM may reduce blood pressure according to a review that compared TM to control groups. A trend over time indicates practicing TM may lower blood pressure. Such effects are comparable to other lifestyle interventions. Conflicting findings across reviews and a potential risk of bias indicated the necessity of further evidence, conducted by researchers without bias. \nAs of 2004, the US government had given more than $20 million to Maharishi International University to study the effect of meditation on health.\nViews and claims.\nViews on consciousness (1963).\nIn his 1963 book, \"The Science of Being and Art of Living,\" Maharishi Mahesh Yogi says that, over time, through the practice of the TM technique, the conscious mind gains familiarity with deeper levels of the mind, bringing the subconscious mind within the capacity of the conscious mind, resulting in expanded awareness in daily activity. He also teaches that the Transcendental Meditation practitioner transcends all mental activity and experiences the 'source of thought', which is said to be pure silence, 'pure awareness' or 'transcendental Being', 'the ultimate reality of life'. TM is sometimes self described as a technology of consciousness. According to author Michael Phelan, \"The fundamental premise of the psychology of fulfillment is that within every person exists a seemingly inexhaustible center of energy, intelligence, and satisfaction... To the extent that our behavior depends on the degree of energy and intelligence available to us, this center of pure creative intelligence may be described as that resource which gives direction to all that we experience, think and do.\"\nAccording to the Maharishi, there are seven levels of consciousness: (i) deep sleep; (ii) dreaming; (iii) waking; (iv) transcendental consciousness; (v) cosmic consciousness; (vi) God consciousness; and, (vii) unity consciousness. The Maharishi says that transcendental consciousness can be experienced through Transcendental Meditation, and that those who meditate regularly over time could become aware of cosmic consciousness. An indication of cosmic consciousness is \"ever present wakefulness\" present even during sleep. Research on long-term TM practitioners experiencing what they describe as cosmic consciousness, has identified unique EEG profiles, muscle tone measurements, and REM indicators that suggest physiological parameters for this self described state of consciousness. However, the Cambridge Handbook of Consciousness notes that it is premature to say that the EEG coherence found in TM is an indication of a higher state of consciousness.\nScience of Creative Intelligence (1971).\nIn 1961, the Maharishi created the \"International Meditation Society for the Science of Creative Intelligence\". In 1971 the Maharishi inaugurated \"Maharishi's Year of Science of Creative Intelligence\" and described SCI as the connection of \"modern science with ancient Vedic science\". Author Philip Goldberg describes it as Vedanta philosophy that has been translated into scientific language. A series of international symposiums on the Science of Creative Intelligence were held between 1970 and 1973 and were attended by scientists and \"leading thinkers\", including Buckminster Fuller, Melvin Calvin, a Nobel Prize winner in chemistry, Hans Selye, Marshal McLuhan and Jonas Salk. These symposiums were held at universities such as Humboldt State University and University of Massachusetts. The following year, the Maharishi developed a World Plan to spread his teaching of SCI around the world.\nThe theoretical part of SCI is taught in a 33-lesson video course. In the early 1970s, the SCI course was offered at more than 25 American universities including Stanford University, Yale University, the University of Colorado, the University of Wisconsin, and Oregon State University. Until 2009, Maharishi University of Management (MUM) required its undergraduate students to take SCI classes, and both MUM and Maharishi European Research University (MERU) in Switzerland have awarded degrees in the field. \"The Independent\" reports that children at Maharishi School learn SCI principles such as \"the nature of life is to grow\" and \"order is present everywhere\". SCI is reported to be part of the curriculum of TM related lower schools in Iowa, Wheaton, Maryland and Skelmersdale, UK. In 1975 SCI was used as the call letters for a TM owned television station in San Bernardino, California.\nPseudoscience.\nThe Science of Creative Intelligence is not science. Theologian Robert M. Price, writing in the \"Creation/Evolution Journal\" (the journal of the National Center for Science Education), compares the Science of Creative Intelligence to Creationism. Price says instruction in the Transcendental Meditation technique is \"never offered without indoctrination into the metaphysics of 'creative intelligence'\". Skeptic James Randi says SCI has \"no scientific characteristics.\" Astrophysicist and sceptic Carl Sagan writes that the \"Hindu doctrine\" of TM is a pseudoscience. Irving Hexham, a professor of religious studies, describes the TM teachings as \"pseudoscientific language that masks its religious nature by mythologizing science\".\nSociologists Rodney Stark and William Sims Bainbridge describe the SCI videotapes as largely based on the Bhagavad Gita, and say that they are \"laced with parables and metaphysical postulates, rather than anything that can be recognized as conventional science\". In 1979, the court case \"Malnak v Yogi\" determined that although SCI/TM is not a theistic religion, it deals with issues of ultimate concern, truth, and other ideas analogous to those in well-recognized religions. Maharishi biographer Paul Mason suggests that the scientific terminology used in SCI was developed by the Maharishi as part of a restructuring of his philosophies in terms that would gain greater acceptance and increase the number of people starting the TM technique. He says that this change toward a more academic language was welcomed by many of the Maharishi's American students.\nMaharishi effect (1974).\nMaharishi Mahesh Yogi claimed that the quality of life would noticeably improve if at least the square root of one per cent (1%) of the population practised the Transcendental Meditation technique. This is known as the \"Maharishi effect\" and according to the Maharishi, it was perceived in 1974 after an analysis of crime statistics in 16 cities. With the introduction of the TM-Sidhi program including Yogic Flying, the Maharishi proposed that the square root of 1 per cent of the population (around 6325 people, the square root of 40 million (1% of the global\npopulation of about 4 billion people in 1974)) practicing this advanced program together at the same time and in the same place would create benefits in society. This was referred to as the \"Extended Maharishi Effect\".\nAuthor Ted Karam claims that there have been numerous studies on the Maharishi effect including a gathering of over 4,000 people (just under two thirds of the square root of 1% of the population as of 1974) in Washington, D.C. in the summer of 1993. The effect has been examined in 42 scientific studies. The TM organisation has linked the fall of the Berlin Wall and a reduction in global terrorism, US inflation and crime rates to the Maharishi effect. The Maharishi effect has been endorsed by the former President of Mozambique Joaquim Chissano.\nAs the theories proposed by TM practitioners are not scientific, the Maharishi effect still lacks a causal basis. Moreover, the evidence has been said to result from cherry-picked data and the credulity of believers. Critics, such as James Randi, have called this research pseudoscience. Randi says that he investigated comments made by former Maharishi International University faculty member Robert Rabinoff in 1978. He spoke to the Fairfield Chief of Police who said local crime levels were the same and the regional Agriculture Department who reportedly deemed that farm yields for Jefferson County matched the state average.\nMaharishi Vedic Science (1981).\nThe Maharishi proclaimed 1981 as the Year of Vedic Science.

VOC ), commonly known as the Dutch East India Company, was a chartered trading company and one of the first joint-stock companies in the world. Established on 20 March 1602 by the States General of the Netherlands amalgamating existing companies, it was granted a 21-year monopoly to carry out trade activities in Asia. Shares in the company could be purchased by any citizen of the Dutch Republic and bought and sold in open-air secondary markets, one of which became the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. The company possessed quasi-governmental powers, including the ability to wage war, imprison and execute convicts, negotiate treaties, strike its own coins, and establish colonies. Because it traded across multiple colonies and countries from both the East and the West, the VOC is sometimes considered to have been the world's first multinational corporation.\nStatistically, the VOC eclipsed all of its rivals in the Asian trade. Between 1602 and 1796, the VOC sent nearly a million Europeans to work in the Asia trade on 4,785 ships, and netted for their efforts more than 2.5\u00a0million tons of Asian trade goods and slaves. By contrast, the rest of Europe combined sent 882,412 people from 1500 to 1795. The fleet of the English, later British East India Company, the VOC's nearest competitor, was a distant second to its total traffic, with 2,690 ships and one-fifth the tonnage of goods carried by the VOC. The VOC enjoyed huge profits from its spice monopoly and slave trading activities through most of the 17th century.\nHaving been established in 1602 to profit from the Malukan spice trade, the VOC established a capital in the port city of Jayakarta in 1619 and changed its name to Batavia, now Jakarta. Over the next two centuries, the company acquired additional ports as trading bases and safeguarded their interests by taking over surrounding territory. It remained an important trading concern and paid annual dividends that averaged to about 18% of the capital for almost 200 years. Weighed down by smuggling, corruption and growing administrative costs in the late 18th century, the company went bankrupt and was formally dissolved in 1799. Its possessions and debt were taken over by the government of the Dutch Batavian Republic.\nCompany name, logo, and flag.\nIn Dutch, the name of the company was the \"Vereenigde Nederlandsche Geoctroyeerde Oostindische Compagnie\", abbreviated as the VOC, literally the 'United Dutch Chartered East India Company' (the United East India Company). The company's monogram logo consisted of a large capital 'V' with an O on the left and a C on the right half and was possibly the first globally recognised corporate logo. It appeared on corporate items, such as flags, cannons, and coins.\nThe first letter of the hometown of the chamber conducting the operation was placed on top. The monogram's versatility, flexibility, clarity, simplicity, symmetry, timelessness, and symbolism are considered notable characteristics of the VOC's professionally designed logo. Those elements ensured its success at a time when the concept of the corporate identity was virtually unknown. An Australian vintner has used the VOC logo since the late 20th century, having re-registered the company's name for the purpose.\nAround the world, and especially in English-speaking countries, the VOC is widely known as the 'Dutch East India Company'. The name 'Dutch East India Company' is used to make a distinction from the [British] East India Company (EIC) and other East Indian companies, such as the Danish East India Company, French East India Company, Portuguese East India Company, and the Swedish East India Company. The company's alternative names that have been used include the 'Dutch East Indies Company', 'United East India Company', 'Jan Company', or 'Jan Compagnie'.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nBefore the Dutch Revolt, which began in 1566/68, the Brabant city of Antwerp had played an important role as a distribution center in northern Europe. After 1591, the Portuguese used an international syndicate of the German Fugger family and Welser family, as well as Spanish and Italian firms, which operated out of Hamburg as the northern staple port to distribute their goods, thereby cutting Dutch merchants out of the trade. At the same time, the Portuguese trade system was unable to increase supply to satisfy growing demand, in particular the demand for pepper. Demand for spices was relatively inelastic; therefore, each lag in the supply of pepper caused a sharp rise in pepper prices.\nIn 1580, the Portuguese crown was united in a personal union with the Spanish crown, known as the Iberian Union, with which the Dutch Republic was at war. The Portuguese Empire thus became an appropriate target for Dutch military incursions. These factors motivated Dutch merchants to enter the intercontinental spice trade themselves. Further, a number of Dutch merchants and explorers, such as Jan Huyghen van Linschoten and Cornelis de Houtman, obtained firsthand knowledge of the \"secret\" Portuguese trade routes and practices, providing further opportunity for the Dutch to enter the trade.\nThe stage was set for Dutch expeditions to the Indonesian islands, beginning with James Lancaster in 1591, Cornelis de Houtman in 1595 and in 1598, Jacob Van Neck in 1598, Lancaster again in 1601, among others. During the four-ship exploratory expedition by Frederick de Houtman in 1595 to Banten, the main pepper port of West Java, the crew clashed with Portuguese and indigenous Javanese. Houtman's expedition then sailed east along the north coast of Java, losing twelve crew members to a Javanese attack at Sidayu and killing a local ruler in Madura. Half the crew were lost before the expedition made it back to the Netherlands in 1596, but with enough spices to make a considerable profit.\nIn 1598, an increasing number of fleets were sent out by competing merchant groups from around the Netherlands. Some fleets were lost, but most were successful, with some voyages producing high profits. In 1598, a fleet of eight ships under Jacob van Neck were the first Dutch fleet to reach the 'Spice Islands' of Maluku, also known as the Moluccas, cutting out the Javanese middlemen. The ships returned to Europe in 1599 and 1600 and the expedition made a 400 percent profit.\nIn 1600, the Dutch joined forces with the Muslim Hituese on Ambon Island in an anti-Portuguese alliance, in return for which the Dutch were given the sole right to purchase spices from Hitu. Dutch control of Ambon was achieved when the Portuguese surrendered their fort in Ambon to the Dutch-Hituese alliance. In 1613, the Dutch expelled the Portuguese from their Solor fort, but a subsequent Portuguese attack led to a second change of hands. Following this second reoccupation, the Dutch again captured Solor in 1636.\nEast of Solor, on the island of Timor, Dutch advances were halted by an autonomous and powerful group of Portuguese Eurasians called the Topasses. They remained in control of the Sandalwood trade. Their resistance lasted throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, causing Portuguese Timor to remain under the Portuguese sphere of control.\nFormative years.\nAt the time, it was customary for a company to be funded only for the duration of a single voyage and to be liquidated upon the return of the fleet. Investment in these expeditions was a very high-risk venture, because of the usual dangers of piracy, disease and shipwreck, and because the interplay of inelastic demand and relatively elastic supply of spices could make prices tumble, thereby ruining prospects of profitability. To manage such risk, the forming of a cartel to control supply would seem logical. In 1600, the English were the first to adopt this approach by bundling their resources into a monopoly enterprise, the English East India Company, thereby threatening their Dutch competitors with ruin.\nIn 1602, the Dutch government followed suit, sponsoring the creation of a single \"United East Indies Company\" that was also granted monopoly over the Asian trade. For a time in the seventeenth century, it was able to monopolise the trade in nutmeg, mace, and cloves and to sell these spices across European kingdoms and Emperor Akbar the Great's Mughal Empire at 14\u201317 times the price it paid in Indonesia. \nWhile Dutch profits soared, the local economy of the Spice Islands was destroyed, because as a monopoly buyer, the VOC forced the prices paid to the local producers in the Spice Islands down to low levels. With a capital of 6,440,200 guilders, the new company's charter empowered it to build forts, maintain armies, and conclude treaties with Asian rulers. It provided for a venture that continued for 21 years, with a financial accounting only at the end of each decade.\nIn February 1603, the company seized the \"Santa Catarina\", a 1,500-ton Portuguese merchant carrack, off the coast of the Malay Peninsula. That same year, a joint Dutch-English force captured another Portuguese carrack off Macau. The proceeds from the sale of the cargo of the two vessels was equivalent to more than 50% of the VOC's original subscription capital.\nIn 1603, the first permanent Dutch trading post in Indonesia was established in Banten, West Java. In 1611, another was established at Jayakarta (later \"Batavia\" and then \"Jakarta\"). In 1610, the VOC established the post of governor-general to more firmly control their affairs in Asia. To advise and control the risk of despotic governors-general, a Council of the Indies (\"Raad van Indi\u00eb\") was created. The governor-general effectively became the main administrator of the VOC's activities in Asia. The \"Heeren XVII\", a body of 17 shareholders representing different chambers, continued to officially have overall control.\nThe VOC headquarters were located in Ambon during the tenures of the first three governors-general (1610\u20131619), but it was not a satisfactory location. Although it was at the centre of the spice production areas, it was far from the Asian trade routes and other VOC areas of activity ranging from Africa to India to Japan. A location in the west of the archipelago was thus sought. The Straits of Malacca were strategic but became dangerous following the Portuguese conquest, and the first permanent VOC settlement in Banten was controlled by a powerful local ruler and subject to stiff competition from Chinese and English traders.\nIn 1604, a second English East India Company voyage commanded by Sir Henry Middleton reached the islands of Ternate, Tidore, Ambon and Banda. In Banda, they encountered severe VOC hostility, sparking Anglo-Dutch competition for access to spices. From 1611 to 1617, the English established trading posts at Sukadana (southwest Kalimantan), Makassar, Jayakarta and Jepara in Java, and Aceh, Pariaman and Jambi in Sumatra, which threatened Dutch ambitions for a monopoly on East Indies trade.\nIn 1620, diplomatic agreements in Europe ushered in a period of collaboration between the Dutch and English spice trades. This ended with the notorious Amboyna massacre, where ten Englishmen were arrested, tried and beheaded for conspiracy against the Dutch government. Although this caused outrage in Europe and a diplomatic crisis, the English quietly withdrew from most of their Indonesian activities, except trading in Banten, and focused on other Asian interests.\nGrowth.\nIn 1619, Jan Pieterszoon Coen was appointed governor-general of the VOC. He saw the possibility of the VOC becoming an Asian power, both political and economic. On 30 May 1619, Coen, backed by a force of nineteen ships, stormed Jayakarta, driving out the Banten forces; and from the ashes established Batavia as the VOC headquarters. In the 1620s almost the entire native population of the Banda Islands was driven away, starved to death, or killed in an attempt to replace them with Dutch plantations. These plantations were used to grow nutmeg for export. Coen hoped to settle large numbers of Dutch colonists in the East Indies, but implementation of this policy never materialised, mainly because very few Dutch were willing to emigrate to Asia.\nAnother of Coen's ventures was more successful. A major problem in the European trade with Asia at the time was that the Europeans could offer few goods that Asian consumers wanted, except silver and gold. European traders therefore had to pay for spices with the precious metals, which were in short supply in Europe, except for Spain and Portugal. The Dutch and English had to obtain it by creating a trade surplus with other European countries. Coen discovered the obvious solution for the problem: to start an intra-Asiatic trade system, whose profits could be used to finance the spice trade with Europe. In the long run this obviated the need for exports of precious metals from Europe, though at first it required the formation of a large trading-capital fund in the Indies. The VOC reinvested a large share of its profits to this end in the period up to 1630.\nThe VOC traded throughout Asia, benefiting mainly from Bengal. Ships coming into Batavia from the Netherlands carried supplies for VOC settlements in Asia. Silver and copper from Japan were used to trade with the world's wealthiest empires, Mughal India and Qing China, for silk, cotton, porcelain, and textiles. These products were either traded within Asia for the coveted spices or brought back to Europe. The VOC was also instrumental in introducing European ideas and technology to Asia. The company supported Christian missionaries and traded modern technology with China and Japan. A more peaceful VOC trade post on Dejima, an artificial island off the coast of Nagasaki, was for more than two hundred years the only place where Europeans were permitted to trade with Japan. When the VOC tried to use military force to make Ming dynasty China open up to Dutch trade, the Chinese defeated the Dutch in a war over the Penghu islands from 1623 to 1624, forcing the VOC to abandon Penghu for Taiwan. The Chinese defeated the VOC again at the Battle of Liaoluo Bay in 1633.\nThe Vietnamese Nguyen lords defeated the VOC in a 1643 battle during the Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n War, blowing up a Dutch ship. The Cambodians defeated the VOC in the Cambodian\u2013Dutch War from 1643 to 1644 on the Mekong River.\nIn 1640, the VOC obtained the port of Galle, Ceylon, from the Portuguese and broke the latter's monopoly of the cinnamon trade. In 1658, Gerard Pietersz Hulft laid siege to Colombo, which was captured with the help of King Rajasinghe II of Kandy. By 1659, the Portuguese had been expelled from the coastal regions, which were then occupied by the VOC, securing for it the monopoly over cinnamon.\nTo prevent the Portuguese or the English from ever recapturing Sri Lanka, the VOC went on to conquer the entire Malabar Coast from the Portuguese, almost entirely driving them from the west coast of India.\nIn 1652, Jan van Riebeeck established a resupply outpost at the Cape of Storms (the southwestern tip of Africa, now Cape Town, South Africa) to service company ships on their journey to and from East Asia. The cape was later renamed Cape of Good Hope in honour of the outpost's presence. Although non-company ships were welcome to use the station, they were charged exorbitantly. This post later became a full-fledged colony, the Cape Colony, when more Dutch and other Europeans started to settle there.\nThrough the seventeenth century VOC trading posts were also established in Persia, Bengal, Malacca, Siam, Formosa (now Taiwan), as well as the Malabar and Coromandel coasts in India. Direct access to mainland China came in 1729 when a factory was established in Canton. In 1661, Ming general Koxinga led a fleet to defeat the Dutch. After Koxinga's Ming loyalists defeated Dutch reinforcements from Java in 1662, Frederick Coyett, the Dutch commander, surrendered Taiwan. (\"see\" History of Taiwan).\nIn 1663, the VOC signed the \"Painan Treaty\" with several local lords in the Painan area that were revolting against the Aceh Sultanate. The treaty allowed the VOC to build a trading post in the area and eventually to monopolise the trade there, especially the gold trade.\nBy 1669, the VOC was the richest private company the world had ever seen, with over 150 merchant ships, 40 warships, 50,000 employees, a private army of 10,000 soldiers, and a dividend payment of 40% on the original investment.\nMany of the VOC employees inter-mixed with the indigenous peoples and expanded the population of Indos in pre-colonial history.\nReorientation.\nAround 1670, two events caused the growth of VOC trade to stall. In the first place, the highly profitable trade with Japan started to decline. The loss of the outpost on Formosa to Koxinga in the 1662 siege of Fort Zeelandia and related internal turmoil in China (where the Ming dynasty was being replaced with the China's Qing dynasty) brought an end to the silk trade after 1666. Though the VOC substituted Mughal Bengal's for Chinese silk, other forces affected the supply of Japanese silver and gold. The shogunate enacted a number of measures to limit the export of these precious metals, in the process limiting VOC opportunities for trade, and severely worsening the terms of trade. Therefore, Japan ceased to function as the linchpin of the intra-Asiatic trade of the VOC by 1685.\nEven more importantly, the Third Anglo-Dutch War temporarily interrupted VOC trade with Europe. This caused a spike in the price of pepper, which enticed the English East India Company (EIC) to enter this market aggressively in the years after 1672. Previously, one of the tenets of the VOC pricing policy was to slightly over-supply the pepper market, so as to depress prices below the level where interlopers were encouraged to enter the market (instead of striving for short-term profit maximisation). The wisdom of such a policy was illustrated when a fierce price war with the EIC ensued, as that company flooded the market with new supplies from India. In this struggle for market share, the VOC (which had much larger financial resources) could wait out the EIC. Indeed, by 1683, the latter came close to bankruptcy; its share price plummeted from 600 to 250; and its president Josiah Child was temporarily forced from office.\nHowever, the writing was on the wall. Other companies, like the French East India Company and the Danish East India Company also started to make inroads on the Dutch system. The VOC therefore closed the theretofore flourishing open pepper emporium of Bantam by a treaty of 1684 with the Sultan. Also, on the Coromandel Coast, it moved its chief stronghold from Pulicat to Nagapattinam, so as to secure a monopoly on the pepper trade to the detriment of the French and the Danes. However, the importance of these traditional commodities in the Asian-European trade was diminishing rapidly at the time. The military outlays that the VOC needed to make to enhance its monopoly were not justified by the increased profits of this declining trade.\nNevertheless, this lesson was slow to sink in and at first the VOC made the strategic decision to improve its military position on the Malabar Coast (hoping thereby to curtail English influence in the area, and end the drain on its resources from the cost of the Malabar garrisons) by using force to compel the Zamorin of Calicut to submit to Dutch domination. In 1710, the Zamorin was made to sign a treaty with the VOC undertaking to trade exclusively with the VOC and expel other European traders. For a brief time, this appeared to improve the company's prospects. However, in 1715, with EIC encouragement, the Zamorin renounced the treaty. Though a Dutch army managed to suppress this insurrection temporarily, the Zamorin continued to trade with the English and the French, which led to an appreciable upsurge in English and French traffic. The VOC decided in 1721 that it was no longer worth the trouble to try to dominate the Malabar pepper and spice trade. A strategic decision was taken to scale down the Dutch military presence and in effect yield the area to EIC influence.\nIn the 1741 Battle of Colachel, warriors of Travancore under Raja Marthanda Varma defeated the Dutch. The Dutch commander Captain Eustachius De Lannoy was captured. Marthanda Varma agreed to spare the Dutch captain's life on condition that he joined his army and trained his soldiers on modern lines. This defeat in the Travancore\u2013Dutch War is considered the earliest example of an organised Asian power overcoming European military technology and tactics; and it signalled the decline of Dutch power in India.\nThe attempt to continue as before as a low volume-high profit business enterprise with its core business in the spice trade had therefore failed. The company had however already (reluctantly) followed the example of its European competitors in diversifying into other Asian commodities, like tea, coffee, cotton, textiles, and sugar. These commodities provided a lower profit margin and therefore required a larger sales volume to generate the same amount of revenue. This structural change in the commodity composition of the VOC's trade started in the early 1680s, after the temporary collapse of the EIC around 1683 offered an excellent opportunity to enter these markets. The actual cause for the change lies, however, in two structural features of this new era.\nIn the first place, there was a revolutionary change in the tastes affecting European demand for Asian textiles, coffee and tea, around the turn of the 18th century. Secondly, a new era of an abundant supply of capital at low interest rates suddenly opened around this time. The second factor enabled the company easily to finance its expansion in the new areas of commerce. Between the 1680s and 1720s, the VOC was therefore able to equip and man an appreciable expansion of its fleet, and acquire a large amount of precious metals to finance the purchase of large amounts of Asian commodities, for shipment to Europe. The overall effect was approximately to double the size of the company.\nThe tonnage of the returning ships rose by 125 percent in this period. However, the company's revenues from the sale of goods landed in Europe rose by only 78 percent. This reflects the basic change in the VOC's circumstances that had occurred: it now operated in new markets for goods with an elastic demand, in which it had to compete on an equal footing with other suppliers. This made for low profit margins. The business information systems of the time made this difficult to discern for the managers of the company, which may partly explain the mistakes they made from hindsight. This lack of information might have been counteracted (as in earlier times in the VOC's history) by the business acumen of the directors. By this time these were almost exclusively recruited from the political \"regent\" class, which had long since lost its close relationship with merchant circles.\nLow profit margins in themselves do not explain the deterioration of revenues. To a large extent the costs of the operation of the VOC had a \"fixed\" character (military establishments; maintenance of the fleet and such). Profit levels might therefore have been maintained if the increase in the scale of trading operations that in fact took place had resulted in economies of scale. However, though larger ships transported the growing volume of goods, labour productivity did not go up sufficiently to realise these. In general the company's overhead rose in step with the growth in trade volume; declining gross margins translated directly into a decline in profitability of the invested capital. The era of expansion was one of \"profitless growth\".\nSpecifically: \"[t]he long-term average annual profit in the VOC's 1630\u201370 'Golden Age' was 2.1\u00a0million guilders, of which just under half was distributed as dividends and the remainder reinvested. The long-term average annual profit in the 'Expansion Age' (1680\u20131730) was 2.0\u00a0million guilders, of which three-quarters was distributed as dividend and one-quarter reinvested. In the earlier period, profits averaged 18 percent of total revenues; in the latter period, 10 percent. The annual return of invested capital in the earlier period stood at approximately 6 percent; in the latter period, 3.4 percent.\"\nNevertheless, in the eyes of investors the VOC did not do too badly. The share price hovered consistently around the 400 mark from the mid-1680s (excepting a hiccup around the Glorious Revolution in 1688), and they reached an all-time high of around 642 in the 1720s. VOC shares then yielded a return of 3.5 percent, only slightly less than the yield on Dutch government bonds.\nDecline and fall.\nAfter 1730, the fortunes of the VOC started to decline. Five major contributing factors are attributed to its decay in the 50 years between 1730 and 1780:\nDespite these problems, the VOC in 1780 remained an enormous operation. Its capital in the Republic, consisting of ships and goods in inventory, totalled 28\u00a0million guilders; its capital in Asia, consisting of the liquid trading fund and goods en route to Europe, totalled 46\u00a0million guilders. Total capital, net of outstanding debt, stood at 62\u00a0million guilders. The prospects of the company at this time therefore were not hopeless, had one of the plans for reform been undertaken successfully. However, the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War intervened. British naval attacks in Europe and Asia reduced the VOC fleet by half; removed valuable cargo from its control; and eroded its remaining power in Asia. The direct losses of the VOC during the war can be calculated at 43 million guilders. Loans to keep the company operating reduced its net assets to zero.\nFrom 1720 on, the market for sugar from Indonesia declined as the competition from cheap sugar from Brazil increased. European markets became saturated. Dozens of Chinese sugar traders went bankrupt, which led to massive unemployment, which in turn led to gangs of unemployed coolies. The Dutch government in Batavia did not adequately respond to these problems. In 1740, rumours of deportation of the gangs from the Batavia area led to widespread rioting. The Dutch military searched houses of Chinese in Batavia for weapons. When a house accidentally burnt down, military and impoverished citizens started slaughtering and pillaging the Chinese community. This massacre of the Chinese was deemed sufficiently serious for the board of the VOC to start an official investigation into the Government of the Dutch East Indies for the first time in its history.\nAfter the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War, the VOC's financial issues worsened considerably. After vain attempts at reorganisation by the provincial States of Holland and Zeeland, the board of directors in the VOC were sacked in 1796 and the company's management was handed over to a \"Committee for Affairs relating to East India Trade and Possessions\" (Dutch: \"Comit\u00e9 tot de zaken van de Oost-Indische handel en bezittingen\"). The VOC charter was renewed several times, but was allowed to expire on 31 December 1799. Most of the possessions of the former VOC were subsequently occupied by Great Britain during the Napoleonic wars, but after the new United Kingdom of the Netherlands was created by the Congress of Vienna, some of these were restored to this successor state of the Dutch Republic by the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814.\nOrganisational structure.\nWhile the VOC mainly operated in what later became the Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia), the company also had important operations elsewhere. It employed people from different continents and origins in the same functions and working environments. Although it was a Dutch company, its employees included not only people from the Netherlands, but also many from Germany and other countries. Besides the diverse north-west European workforce recruited by the VOC in the Dutch Republic, the VOC made extensive use of local Asian labour markets. As a result, the personnel of the various VOC offices in Asia consisted of European and Asian employees. Asian or Eurasian workers could be employed as sailors, soldiers, writers, carpenters, smiths, or as simple unskilled workers. At the height of its existence, the VOC had 25,000 employees who worked in Asia and 11,000 who were en route. Also, while most of its shareholders were Dutch, about a quarter of the initial shareholders were Zuid-Nederlanders (people from an area that includes modern Belgium and Luxembourg), and there were also a few dozen Germans.\nThe VOC had two types of shareholders: the \"participanten\", who could be seen as non-managing members, and the 76 \"bewindhebbers\" (later reduced to 60) who acted as managing directors. This was the usual set-up for Dutch joint-stock companies at the time. The innovation in the case of the VOC was that the liability of not just the \"participanten\" but also of the \"bewindhebbers\" was limited to the paid-in capital (usually, \"bewindhebbers\" had unlimited liability). The VOC therefore was a limited liability company. Also, the capital would be \"permanent\" during the lifetime of the company. As a consequence, investors that wished to liquidate their interest in the interim could only do this by selling their share to others on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange.\n\"Confusion of confusions\", a 1688 dialogue by the Sephardi Jew Joseph de la Vega analysed the workings of this one-stock exchange.\nThe VOC consisted of six Chambers (\"Kamers\") in port cities: Amsterdam, Delft, Rotterdam, Enkhuizen, Middelburg and Hoorn. Delegates of these chambers convened as the \"Heeren XVII\" (the Lords Seventeen). They were selected from the \"bewindhebber\"-class of shareholders.\nOf the \"Heeren XVII\", eight delegates were from the Chamber of Amsterdam (one short of a majority on its own), four from the Chamber of Zeeland, and one from each of the smaller Chambers, while the seventeenth seat was alternatively from the Chamber of Middelburg-Zeeland or rotated among the five small Chambers. Amsterdam had thereby the decisive voice. The Zeelanders in particular had misgivings about this arrangement at the beginning. The fear was not unfounded, because in practice it meant Amsterdam stipulated what happened.\nThe six chambers raised the start-up capital of the Dutch East India Company:\nThe raising of capital in Rotterdam did not go so smoothly. A considerable part originated from inhabitants of Dordrecht. Although it did not raise as much capital as Amsterdam or Middelburg-Zeeland, Enkhuizen had the largest input in the share capital of the VOC. Under the first 358 shareholders, there were many small entrepreneurs, who dared to take the risk. The minimum investment in the VOC was 3,000 guilders, which priced the company's stock within the means of many merchants.\nAmong the early shareholders of the VOC, immigrants played an important role. Under the 1,143 tenderers were 39 Germans and no fewer than 301 from the Southern Netherlands (roughly present Belgium and Luxembourg, then under Habsburg rule), of whom Isaac le Maire was the largest subscriber with \u019285,000. VOC's total capitalisation was ten times that of its British rival.\nThe \"Heeren XVII\" (Lords Seventeen) met alternately six years in Amsterdam and two years in Middelburg-Zeeland. They defined the VOC's general policy and divided the tasks among the Chambers. The Chambers carried out all the necessary work, built their own ships and warehouses and traded the merchandise. The \"Heeren XVII\" sent the ships' masters off with extensive instructions on the route to be navigated, prevailing winds, currents, shoals and landmarks. The VOC also produced its own charts.\nIn the context of the Dutch\u2013Portuguese War the company established its headquarters in Batavia, Java (now Jakarta, Indonesia). Other colonial outposts were also established in the East Indies, such as on the Maluku Islands, which include the Banda Islands, where the VOC forcibly maintained a monopoly over nutmeg and mace. Methods used to maintain the monopoly involved extortion and the violent suppression of the native population, including mass murder. In addition, VOC representatives sometimes used the tactic of burning spice trees to force indigenous populations to grow other crops, thus artificially cutting the supply of spices like nutmeg and cloves.\nShareholder activism and governance issues.\nThe seventeenth-century Dutch businessmen, especially the VOC investors, were possibly history's first recorded investors to seriously consider the problems of corporate governance. Isaac Le Maire, who is known as history's first recorded short seller, was also a sizeable shareholder of the VOC. In 1609, he complained of the VOC's poor corporate governance. On 24 January 1609, Le Maire filed a petition against the VOC, marking the first recorded expression of shareholder activism. In what is the first recorded corporate governance dispute, Le Maire formally charged that the VOC's board of directors (the Heeren XVII) sought to \"retain another's money for longer or use it ways other than the latter wishes\" and petitioned for the liquidation of the VOC in accordance with standard business practice. Initially the largest single shareholder in the VOC and a \"bewindhebber\" sitting on the board of governors, Le Maire apparently attempted to divert the firm's profits to himself by undertaking 14 expeditions under his own accounts instead of those of the company. Since his large shareholdings were not accompanied by greater voting power, Le Maire was soon ousted by other governors in 1605 on charges of embezzlement, and was forced to sign an agreement not to compete with the VOC. Having retained stock in the company following this incident, in 1609 Le Maire would become the author of what is celebrated as \"first recorded expression of shareholder advocacy at a publicly traded company\".\nIn 1622, the history's first recorded shareholder revolt also happened among the VOC investors who complained that the company account books had been \"smeared with bacon\" so that they might be \"eaten by dogs.\" The investors demanded a \"reeckeninge,\" a proper financial audit. The 1622 campaign by the shareholders of the VOC is a testimony of genesis of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in which shareholders staged protests by distributing pamphlets and complaining about management self enrichment and secrecy.\nMain trading posts, settlements, and colonies.\nThe company's global headquarters were in Amsterdam, with other posts in the Dutch cities of Delft, Enkhuizen, Hoorn, Middelburg and Rotterdam. In Africa, the trading posts and colonies were in Dutch Mauritius in 1638-1658 and 1664\u20131710, and in the Dutch Cape Colony between 1652 and 1806. The South Asian and Indonesian posts and colonies of the company were in Batavia, Dutch East Indies, Dutch Coromandel in 1806\u20131825, Dutch Suratte in 1616-1825, Dutch Bengal from 1827 to 1825, Dutch Ceylon from 1640 to 1796, and Dutch Malabar from 1661 to 1795. \nThe Japanese post was in Hirado, Nagasaki from 1609 to 1641, but was relocated to Dejima from 1641 to 1853. In Taiwan, the company had bases in Anping (Fort Zeelandia), Tainan (Fort Provincia), Wang-an, Penghu on the Pescadores Islands (Fort Vlissingen; 1620\u20131624), Keelung (Fort Noord-Holland and Fort Victoria) and Tamsui (Fort Antonio). \nIn Malaysia, the company was based in Dutch Malacca in 1641-1795 and 1818\u20131825. In Thailand, the company was based in Ayutthaya in 1608\u20131767. In Vietnam, the company was based in Hanoi/Tonkin in 1636\u20131699, and in H\u1ed9i An in 1636\u20131741.\n\"VOC mentality\".\nFor Balkenende, the VOC represented Dutch business acumen, entrepreneurship, adventurous spirit, and decisiveness. However, it unleashed a wave of criticism, since such romantic views about the Dutch Golden Age ignores the inherent historical associations with colonialism, exploitation and violence. Balkenende later stressed that \"it had not been his intention to refer to that at all\". But in spite of criticisms, the \"VOC-mentality\", as a characteristic of the selective historical perspective on the Dutch Golden Age, has been considered a key feature of Dutch cultural policy for many years.\nCriticism.\nThe company has been criticised for the results of its quasi-absolute commercial monopoly, colonialism, exploitation (including use of slave labour), slave trade, use of violence, environmental destruction (including deforestation), and for its overly bureaucratic organisational structure.\nBatavia, corresponding to present day Jakarta, was the headquarters of the Dutch East India Company, and had a strict social hierarchy in the colony. According to Marsely L. Kahoe in \"The Journal of Historians of Netherlandish Art\", \"it is misleading to understand Batavia, as some scholars have, as representing a pragmatic and egalitarian order that was later corrupted by the colonial situation. In fact, the social stratification and segregation of Batavia derived in certain ways directly from its Dutch plan.\"\nThere was an extraordinarily high mortality rate among employees of the VOC due to shipwrecks, illnesses such as scurvy and dysentery, and clashes with rival trading companies and pirates. Between 1602 and 1795, about one million seamen and craftsmen departed from Holland, but only 340,000 returned. J.L. van Zanden writes that \"the VOC 'consumed' approximately 4,000 people per year.\"\nColonialism, monopoly and violence.\nThe total population of the islands was estimated at 15,000 people before the conquest. Although the exact number remains uncertain, it is estimated that around 14,000 people were killed, enslaved or fled elsewhere, with only 1,000 Bandanese surviving in the islands, and were spread throughout the nutmeg groves as forced labourers. The treatment of slaves was harsh and the native Bandanese population dropped to 1,000 by 1681. 200 slaves were imported annually to sustain the slave population at a total of 4,000.\nIn 1623 on Ambon (Amboina), VOC officials arrested, tortured, and executed ten English East India Company employees along with Japanese and Portuguese auxiliaries for an alleged conspiracy, an episode known as the Amboyna massacre that ended Anglo-Dutch cooperation in the Moluccas and showcased the Company's reliance on judicial coercion to police its monopolies.\nIn 1740, amid a severe downturn in Batavia's sugar economy, VOC troops and allied militias killed thousands of ethnic Chinese residents; scholarly estimates range from about 5,000 to over 10,000 deaths in what became known as the Batavia massacre.\nEarlier, in 1636, VOC forces mounted a punitive expedition on Lamey (Lamay) Island off Taiwan after shipwreck incidents; most inhabitants were killed or deported and the island was effectively depopulated.\nDutch slave trade and slavery under the VOC colonial rule.\nBy the time the settlement was established at the Cape in 1652, the VOC already had a long experience of practicing slavery in the East Indies. Jan van Riebeeck concluded within two months of the establishment of the Cape settlement that slave labor would be needed for the hardest and dirtiest work. Initially, the VOC considered enslaving men from the indigenous Khoikhoi population, but the idea was rejected on the grounds that such a policy would be both costly and dangerous. Most Khoikhoi had chosen not to labor for the Dutch because of low wages and harsh conditions. In the beginning, the settlers traded with the Khoikhoi, but the harsh working conditions and low wages imposed by the Dutch led to a series of wars. The European population remained under 200 during the settlement's first five years, and war against neighbors numbering more than 20,000 would have been foolhardy. Moreover, the Dutch feared that Khoikhoi people, if enslaved, could always escape into the local community, whereas foreigners would find it much more difficult to escape and survive or avoid recapture.\nBetween 1652 and 1657, a number of unsuccessful attempts were made to obtain men from the Dutch East Indies and from Mauritius. In 1658, however, the VOC landed two shiploads of slaves at the Cape, one containing more than 200 people brought from Dahomey (later Benin), the second with almost 200 people, most of them children, captured from a Portuguese slaver off the coast of Angola. Except for a few individuals, these were to be the only slaves ever brought to the Cape from West Africa. From 1658 to the end of the company's rule, many more slaves were brought regularly to the Cape in various ways, chiefly by Company-sponsored slaving voyages and slaves brought to the Cape by its return fleets. From these sources and by natural growth, the slave population increased from zero in 1652 to about 1,000 by 1700. During the 18th century, the slave population increased dramatically to 16,839 by 1795. After the slave trade was initiated, all of the slaves imported into the Cape until the British stopped the trade in 1807 were from East Africa, Mozambique, Madagascar, and South and Southeast Asia. Large numbers were brought from Ceylon and the Indonesian archipelago. Prisoners from other countries in the VOC's empire were also enslaved. The slave population, which exceeded that of the European settlers until the first quarter of the nineteenth century, was overwhelmingly male and was thus dependent on constant imports of new slaves to maintain and to augment its size.\nBy the 1660s the Cape settlement was importing slaves from Ceylon, Malaya (Malaysia), and Madagascar to work on the farms. Conflict between Dutch farmers and Khoikhoi broke out once it became clear to the latter that the Dutch were there to stay and that they intended to encroach on the lands of the pastoralists. In 1659 Doman, a Khoikhoi who had worked as a translator for the Dutch and had even traveled to Java, led an armed attempt to expel the Dutch from the Cape peninsula. The attempt was a failure, although warfare dragged on until an inconclusive peace was established a year later. During the following decade, pressure on the Khoikhoi grew as more of the Dutch became free burghers, expanded their landholdings, and sought pastureland for their growing herds. War broke out again in 1673 and continued until 1677, when Khoikhoi resistance was destroyed by a combination of superior European weapons and Dutch manipulation of divisions among the local people. Thereafter, Khoikhoi society in the western Cape disintegrated. Some people found jobs as shepherds on European farms; others rejected foreign rule and moved away from the Cape. The final blow for most came in 1713 when a Dutch ship brought smallpox to the Cape. Hitherto unknown locally, the disease ravaged the remaining Khoikhoi, killing 90 percent of the population. Throughout the eighteenth century, the settlement continued to expand through internal growth of the European population and the continued importation of slaves. The approximately 3,000 Europeans and slaves at the Cape in 1700 had increased by the end of the century to nearly 20,000 Europeans, and approximately 25,000 slaves.\nArchives and records.\nThe VOC's operations (trading posts and colonies) produced not only warehouses packed with spices, coffee, tea, textiles, porcelain and silk, but also shiploads of documents. Data on political, economic, cultural, religious, and social conditions spread over an enormous area circulated between the VOC establishments, the administrative centre of the trade in Batavia (modern-day Jakarta), and the board of directors (the Heeren XVII/Gentlemen Seventeen) in the Dutch Republic. Twenty-five million pages of VOC records survive, held in Jakarta; Colombo, Sri Lanka; Chennai, India; Cape Town, South Africa; and The Hague, the Netherlands. In 2003, UNESCO added this collection of records to its Memory of the World international register.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
